'''2018 LA''', also known as '''ZLAF9B2''', was a small [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo]] [[near-Earth asteroid]] approximately {{convert|2.6|-|3.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} in diameter that impacted Earth at roughly 16:44 UTC (18:44 local time) on 2 June 2018 near the border of [[Botswana]] and [[South Africa]]. It was discovered only 8 hours prior by the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]], and based on an hour and a half of observations, it was calculated to have a roughly 85% chance of impacting Earth,&lt;ref name="Gray85" /&gt; likely somewhere between [https://www.projectpluto.com/temp/z.png Australia and Madagascar]. Hours later, a report arrived to the [[American Meteor Society]] that an observer from Botswana had seen a bright [[Fireball (meteor)|fireball]]. After the impact, the [[Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System]] (ATLAS) released observations roughly 2 hours after the other reported observations which confirmed that the asteroid had indeed impacted Earth on a grazing path and near the location of the fireball. A preliminary analysis of the pre-impact evolution of this meteoroid suggests that it may be part of a dynamical grouping.&lt;ref name="pre-impact"&gt;{{cite journal

== Discovery ==

On 2 June 2018, at roughly 08:22 UTC (01:22 local time), the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]] picked up an 18th magnitude asteroid moving quickly against the background stars. The object was observed over the course of 15 minutes and submitted to the [[Minor Planet Center]], and was followed up by the same survey for the next hour or so, resulting in an [[Observation arc]] of 1 hour and 17 minutes. The asteroid was soon identified as [[Asteroid impact prediction|having a chance of impacting Earth]] (identified by [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]]'s scout program as 30% odds, calculated by Bill Gray as 82%) and one [[precovery]] observation was found just 7 minutes prior to its discovery observation, resulting in a final observation arc of 85 minutes before the asteroid was widely considered lost.

== Entry and ATLAS observations ==
[[File:2018 LA-impact trajectory.png|thumb|left|JPL estimated final trajectory and timing]]

[[File:Animation of 2018 LA orbit.gif |thumb |left|Animation of 2018 LA{{'s}} orbit from 2 June 2016 to 2 June 2018&lt;br&gt;{{legend2|magenta| 2018 LA}}{{·}}{{legend2| Cyan |[[Venus]]}}{{·}}{{legend2| RoyalBlue|[[Earth]]}}{{·}}{{legend2| Lime |[[Mars]]}}]]
Several hours later, at 16:44 UTC, a report arrived from southern [[Botswana]] to the [[American Meteor Society]] that an exceptionally bright fireball had been spotted. Although this was further west than projected based on the initial observations, the timing and location were consistent, although substantiated by just one observer.

Confirmation that the asteroid had indeed impacted Earth, rather than simply a near approach, came when two observations by the [[Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System]] (ATLAS) arrived later the same day and extended the observation arc from 85 minutes to 3 hours and 47 minutes, significantly improving the orbital parameters.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; The 4 hour observation arc better constrained the [[Confidence region|line of variations]] and showed that the asteroid was virtually certain to impact Earth, and based only on the sky observations, projected to have impacted in [[Namibia]] instead. This proves consistent with the fireball report.

The [[bolide]] was also detected by [[infrasound]] at station I47 in South Africa and registered about 0.4&amp;nbsp;kt.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; The asteroid was several meters in diameter and impacted the atmosphere going about {{convert|17|km/s|mph|abbr=on}}. Based on its velocity and energy, the asteroid was likely 2.6-3.8 meters in diameter.

Asteroids in the range of several meters in diameter are very hard to detect as they are too small to reflect much sunlight. For example, on 24 May 2018, the asteroid was still {{convert|0.069|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth and only had an [[Apparent_magnitude#25|apparent magnitude]] of 25.5, much dimmer than any major modern surveys can detect using rapid-fire 30 second snapshots meant to cover as much of the sky as possible.&lt;ref name="Stolte"/&gt;

== Fragment recovery==
Scientists promptly looked for a meteorite [[strewn field]], hoping to recover fragments of the asteroid before they had a chance to weather too much. Fragments can achieve dark flight after deceleration to terminal velocity. Dark flight starts when fragments decelerate to about 2–4&amp;nbsp;km/s. Larger fragments will fall further down the strewn field.

Assuming a similar fraction of 2018 LA survived as of {{mpl|2008 TC|3}}, several kilograms of meteorites were expected to have reached the ground and be recoverable. 2018 LA was estimated to only be about 40% as massive as {{mp|2008 TC|3}}.

On June 23, three weeks after the asteroid entered Earth's atmosphere, the first meteorite fragments were recovered by scientists. The physical characteristics of the meteorites are not yet known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astrobob.areavoices.com/2018/07/06/first-fragment-of-shattered-asteroid-recovered-in-botswana First Fragment Of Shattered Asteroid Recovered In Botswana] July 6, 2018, Bob King&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of sacrament==
{{cquote| ''"The tradition traces back to the time of Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji who started the tradition of hunting for Sikhs...The tradition of ritually sacrificing goats and consuming Mahaparshad remains alive not only with the Nihang Singh Dals, but also at Sachkhand Sri Hazoor Sahib and Sachkhand Sri Patna Sahib (two of the Sikhs holiest shrines). "'' |30px|30px| www.nihangsingh.org &lt;ref name= "Sikh Goat Sacrifice"/&gt;}}

The introduction of this religious rite is traced by Hazuri Sikhs to Guru Hargobind.&lt;ref name= "Sikh Goat Sacrifice"/&gt; It is said that this sacrifice was also performed by Guru Gobind Singh on the founding day of the Khalsa on his own followers.&lt;ref&gt;Transition of Sikhism into a political organization, pp 79, Gokul Chand Narang,Printed at the "Tribune" press, 1910&lt;/ref&gt; It should be kept in mind certain sections of modern Sikhs do not approve of this sacrificial ritual.&lt;ref name = "Sikh Bulletin"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hazuri Sikh Goat Sacrifice"&gt;WORLD SIKH CONFERENCE - SYDNEY 2004, A REPORT, pp 6. Sikh Council of Australia , www.sikhcouncil.org.au&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Nishter Singh"&gt;Sacrifice at Hazur Sahib – Myth &amp; Truth, Nanak Singh Nishter , World Sikh News, 21 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tilak sacrament at Hazur Sahib==
{{cquote| ''"When performing Jhatka on a goat, first the goat is bathed, then [[Japji Sahib]] and [[Chandi di Var]] are read. One Singh stands by the head of the goat and upon the final lines of [[Chandi di Var]] being read, ‘Those who sing this divine ballad will be liberated from the realm of life and death’, at this moment the goat is decapitated with one blow and the soul of the goat is liberated. The goat itself lowers its head to receive salvation. "'' |30px|30px|&lt;ref name= "Sikh Goat Sacrifice"/&gt;}}

The ritual begins with bathing the sacrificial goat with water.  While the water is being poured on the goat, liturgical recitations from the Sikh scriptures of [[Japji Sahib]] and [[Chandi di Var]] are practiced.&lt;ref name= "Sikh Goat Sacrifice"/&gt; Thereafter, the goat is taken in the middle of the Gurudwara compound. One Nihang Singh holds the hind legs of the goat while the other slaughters it using Jhatka technique. After this the head of the goat is taken in a saucer and its blood is applied to the weapons of Guru Gobind Singh, which are placed in front of Guru Granth Sahib.&lt;ref name = "Nishter Singh"/&gt;

==Debate within community==
There exists a debate within this community whether or this ritual is part of ''Gurmat'', i.e., within scriptural sanction of Sikh teachings. Some scholars say that this ritual is misunderstood and do not equate it with sacrificial slaughter found in some other religions.&lt;ref name = "Nishter Singh"/&gt; There are yet others who regard this ritual to be entirely outside Sikhism.&lt;ref name= "Sikh Review"/&gt; Others, Nihangs and Hazuri Sikhs in particular,  however argue the opposite and consider  it ''Manmat'', or product of self-willed minds, to regard Tilak sacrament not to have  come directly from Sri Hargobind Sahib.&lt;ref name= "Sikh Goat Sacrifice"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"Until today this tradition still exists at all Sikh Takhts, should for any reason this be stopped it would be great manmat (egocentric action of men which is against the teachings of the Gurus)’ (Jhatka Parkash, Page 228)"'', Nihangsingh.org&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5914">The '''Antarctic oscillation''' (AAO, to distinguish it from the [[Arctic oscillation]] or AO) is a low-frequency [[mode of variability|mode of atmospheric variability]] of the southern hemisphere. It is also known as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). It is defined as a belt of [[Westerlies|westerly winds]] or low pressure surrounding [[Antarctica]] which moves north or south as its mode of variability.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Meteorology - The Southern Annular Mode. Accessed 25/10/2013. http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/history/ln-2010-12/SAM-what.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; In its positive phase, the westerly wind belt that drives the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] intensifies and contracts towards [[Antarctica]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=David W.

In 2014, Dr [[Nerilie Abram]] used a network of temperature-sensitive ice core and tree growth records to reconstruct a 1000-year history of the Southern Annular Mode. This work suggests that the Southern Annular Mode is currently in its most extreme positive phase over at least the last 1000 years, and that recent positive trends in the SAM are attributed to increasing greenhouse gas levels and later stratospheric ozone depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://hurricane.ncdc.noaa.gov/pls/paleox/f?p=519:1:0::::P1_STUDY_ID:16197|accessdate = 18 August 2014|title = Data: 1000-year Southern Annular Mode reconstruction|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Abram |first=Nerilie|url=http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n7/full/nclimate2235.html |title=Evolution of the Southern Annular Mode during the past millennium |work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=2014-05-11 |accessdate=2014-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arabella Burton Buckley''' (24 October 1840 – 9 February 1929)&lt;ref name=LCCN&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lccn.loc.gov/n84802515 |title=Buckley, Arabella B. (Arabella Burton), 1840–1929 |website=Library of Congress Authorities |accessdate=21 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a writer and science educator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=FISHER, Mrs. Arabella B.|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=599|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Buckley was born in [[Brighton]], England.&lt;ref name=LCCN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arabella B. Buckley: Popularizer of science and writer |url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095533535 |work=Oxford Index |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother was [[Henry Buckley, 1st Baron Wrenbury]]. At the age of 24, she went to work as secretary to [[Charles Lyell]], and remained with him until his death in 1875, on which [[Charles Darwin]] wrote to her to commiserate with her. After that, she began lecturing and writing on science.

Being Charles Lyell's assistant and a female put her in good standing to educate youth. One of Buckley's earlier pieces, The Fairy-Land of Science, puts her views of science in a children's book setting, much like a mother educating her child. Her work was labelled as lectures rather than chapters, mirroring how she would teach young people. One of her lectures, "The Two Great Sculptors - Water and Ice" emphasizes how water and ice create hills, crevasses and valleys much as a sculptor will create a statue using a chisel. It also describes how water always needs somewhere to go and often takes part of the land with it, causing cliffs to fall apart leaving faults and intrusions behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/fairylandscience00buckiala#page/122/mode/2up |title=The Fairy-Land of Science |last=Buckley |first=Arabella |publisher= |year=1880 |isbn= |location=London|pages=99–123|quote=|via=Open Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; She saw no contradiction in using fancy to present fact, writing of the natural world: "Can any magic tale be more marvellous, or any thought grander, or more sublime than this?"&lt;ref name="Reisert"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reisert |first1=Sarah |title=The Magic of It All: To explain their world, Victorians married the natural with the supernatural |journal=Distillations |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=44–45 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-magic-of-it-all |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buckley married at the age of 44, but continued publishing under her maiden name, although one of the later editions of ''Eyes and No Eyes'' gives her married name (Mrs Fisher). She also edited two other publications: [[Mary Somerville]]'s ''Connexion of the Physical Sciences'' (1877) and [[Heinrich Leutemann]]'s ''Animals from Life'' (1887). Her books were translated into Japanese, Polish and Swedish in her lifetime.

In Buckley's time, male scientists often had female assistants and included some of their findings in the lead scientists' work. The women themselves generally would not be labelled scientists, and so did not receive any acknowledgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/281/1/1.full |title=The Role Of Women In The History And Development Of Geology: An Introduction |editor-last1=Burek |editor-first1=C.

Arabella Buckley died of influenza at her home, 3 Boburg Terrace, [[Sidmouth]], Devon, on 9 February 1929.&lt;ref name=LCCN/&gt;

[[Commander]] '''William Donald Aelian "Bill" King''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] &amp; [[Medal bar|Bar]], [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|DSC]] (23 June 1910&amp;nbsp;– 21 September 2012) was a British naval officer, yachtsman and author. He was the oldest participant in the first solo non-stop, around-the-world [[Yacht racing|yacht race]], the [[Sunday Times Golden Globe Race]], the only person to command a British submarine on both the first and last days of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/naval-obituaries/9561339/Commander-Bill-King.html|title=Obituaries:Commander Bill King|work=Daily Telegraph|date=23 September 2012|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, he was the last surviving British World War II submarine commander.
 
Brought up by his mother and grandmother, King went to the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth. He was first assigned to the battleship {{HMS|Resolution|09|2}}, and later became commanding officer of the submarine {{HMS|Snapper|39S|2}}. He served on three separate vessels in World War II, and was promoted to commander and awarded seven medals during the war. King not only survived World War II, but succeeded in a singlehanded [[circumnavigation]] in 1973 on his third attempt. During the latter journey, he managed to reach port despite a collision with a large sea creature {{convert|400|mi|km}} southwest of Australia.

==Family background and childhood==
William Donald Aelian King was born to William Albert de Courcy King and Georgina Marie MacKenzie in 1910. King's grandfather, [[William King (geologist)|William King]], was Chair of Mineralogy and Geology at [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Queen's College, Galway]]. He was appointed when the College first opened in 1849.&lt;ref name=Emblem&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article649357.ece Sharrock, David. 2006] "A medal at 96?

King, Hasler and Primrose had "teamed up" to design the boat, which was displayed "at the [[London Boat Show]] in January 1968". King's intention to sail around the world was overtaken by the institution in March 1968 of the [[Sunday Times Golden Globe Race]]. Aged 58, King became the oldest participant in what was the first organised round the world solo yacht race.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In ''Deep Water'', King explained that he joined the race as a means of recovering psychologically from fifteen years of service in submarines. This, he said, had left him "a nervous wreck". He had planned to sail around the world before he heard of the race, which "sort of caught up with me." An aunt's legacy provided him with the means to finance the boat.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

One of the shortcomings of the boat was that it had neither guard rails or shrouds to hold on to. King solved this problem with a steel wire that stretched from bow to [[stern]], to which he clipped a harness. His method was then copied by fellow racers Loïck Fougeron and [[Bernard Moitessier]].&lt;ref name="Moitessier"&gt;Moitessier, Bernard.

King was below deck when he heard a shattering sound and saw the hull below the water line bulge inward and splinter. He rushed upstairs and heeled the boat so that the hole was lifted out of the water. He had to hang over the side and submerge himself to carry out emergency repairs with material that included thirteen ropes, sticky tape, collision covers, sheet copper, and sponge rubber. Then he had to fix the inside of the hull as well.

==Later life==
In September 2007, King and his daughter Leonie, still lived at [[Oranmore Castle]].&lt;ref name=Oranmore/&gt; His life's experiences continue to attract media attention, from film to music to art installation.

He was filmed for two documentaries about the Golden Globe Race; the 1960s BBC short ''Golden Globe – Lone Sailor Round the World Race'' and 2006's ''Deep Water''. His war experiences still fascinate documentary film makers. King was interviewed for two planned productions, a 24 minute episode entitled "To Honour and Peace" for the proposed series entitled ''Bravery Beneath the Waves'',&lt;ref name=ToHonour&gt;[http://www.periscopeproduction.com/tohonour.shtml Periscope Productions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128014559/http://www.periscopeproduction.com/tohonour.shtml|date=28 November 2006}} "To Honour and Peace." Episode from proposed ''Bravery Beneath the Waves'' series; retrieved 15 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and for ''The Stick &amp; The Stars: The Life &amp; Times of Commander Bill King''.

Most recent attention arises from King's interaction with Akira Tsurukame and Katja Boonstra-Blom – the subject of print media articles, an exhibition, and video interviews. Tsurukame, son of the chief engineer who perished with ''I-166'', in 2004 sought out King. King, Tsurukame, and Katja Boonstra, whose father was killed when ''I-166'' sank the Dutch submarine [[HNLMS K VXI|''K XVI'']], together planted a tree at Oranmore Castle to honour the fathers of the latter two.&lt;ref name="Tree"&gt;O'Gorman, Ronnie,[http://www.galwayadvertiser.ie/dws//story.tpl?inc=2004/08/26/news/49910.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120065041/http://www.galwayadvertiser.ie/dws/story.tpl?inc=2004%2F08%2F26%2Fnews%2F49910.html|date=20 November 2007}} "Tree of peace planted as former enemies embrace beside Galway Bay", ''Galway Advertiser'', 24 August 2004.

The local paper, ''The Galway Advertiser'', dubbed their threeway meeting at Oranmore Castle a "reconciliation". Subsequently Akira Tsurukame released video material of his interviews with Bill King on the internet. Two installations in July 2006 at the Project 06 art exhibition in Galway referenced King. ''Response to Japanese Peace and Reconciliation'' was arranged in Swan House, and featured art-works by his daughter Leonie King and grand-daughter Heather Finn. The ''Lost at Sea'' installation was a collaboration between Galway-based ''Cane 141'', who set stories told by Bill King to electronic music, and visual artist Roisin Coyle. The latter installation has since been exhibited in [[Dublin]], and in May 2007 at Grace Exhibition Space in New York City.&lt;ref name=Installation&gt;[http://www.cane141.com/news.html Caine141.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220211609/http://www.cane141.com/news.html|date=20 December 2007}} ''Lost at Sea Installation''; retrieved 15 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GraceSpace&gt;[http://gracespace.multiply.com/calendar/item/10046 Grace Exhibition Space] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714131701/http://gracespace.multiply.com/calendar/item/10046|date=14 July 2011}} ''Roisin Mary Installation''; retrieved 15 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roisin&gt;[http://www.romyillustrations.com/id71.html "Lost at Sea"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531095006/http://www.romyillustrations.com/id71.html|date=31 May 2009}} Grace Exhibition Space, [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York]], May 2007; retrieved 15 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Bill King's great nephew Luke Leslie produced the short film ''King of the Waves'', which dramatised King's solo circumnavigation and encounter with the great white shark. It also included interviews with King himself. It was screened before King and his family in [[Oranmore|Oranmore, County Galway]] on his ninety-ninth birthday shortly before premiering at the 2009 Galway, Cork and Kerry film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Personal stylist|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/all-hail-the-king-of-the-waves-a-hero-whos-still-young-at-heart-1794653.html|title=All hail the King of the waves, a hero who's still young at heart|publisher=Independent.ie|accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King died in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0922/1224324272443.html|title=Oldest War submarine commander dies at 102|publisher=The Irish Times|date=22 September 2012|accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, he was the oldest surviving World War II submarine commander.&lt;ref name=Forum/&gt;

'''Bromomethane''', commonly known as '''methyl bromide''', is an [[organobromine compound]] with [[chemical formula|formula]] [[Carbon|C]][[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[[Bromine|Br]]. This colorless, odorless, nonflammable gas is produced both industrially and particularly biologically. It has a tetrahedral shape and it is a recognized [[ozone depletion|ozone-depleting]] chemical. It was used extensively as a [[pesticide]] until being phased out by most countries in the early 2000s.

==Occurrence and manufacture==
Bromomethane originates from both natural and human sources. In the [[ocean]], marine organisms are estimated to produce 56,000 tonnes annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Gribble, G. W. | title = The diversity of naturally occurring organobromine compounds | journal = Chemical Society Reviews | year = 1999 | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 335–346 | doi = 10.1039/a900201d }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also produced in small quantities by certain terrestrial plants, such as members of the [[Brassicaceae]] family. It is manufactured for agricultural and industrial use by reacting [[methanol]] with [[hydrogen bromide]]:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH + HBr  →  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Uses==
In 1999, an estimated 71,500 tonnes of synthetic methyl bromide were used annually worldwide.&lt;ref name=uneptie&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uneptie.org/ozonaction/information/mmc/lib_detail.asp?r=4202| title=Towards Methyl Bromide Phase Out: A Handbook for National Ozone Units| date=1 August 1999| publisher=UNEP| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716112400/http://www.uneptie.org/ozonaction/information/mmc/lib_detail.asp?r=4202| archivedate=2011-07-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 97% of this estimate was used for [[fumigation]] purposes, whilst 3% was used for the manufacture of other products. Moreover, 75% of the consumption used to take place in developed nations, led by the United States (43%) and Europe (24%). Asia and the Middle East combined to use 24% whereas Latin America and Africa had the lowest usage at 9%.&lt;ref name=uneptie /&gt;
[[File:China methyl bromide pallet.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[ISPM 15]] markings on a pallet from China. The '''MB''' indicates the wood has been fumigated with methyl bromide to kill pests.]]
Until its production and use was curtailed by the [[Montreal Protocol]], bromomethane was widely applied as a soil [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilant]], mainly for production of seed but also for some crops such as [[strawberry|strawberries]]&lt;ref&gt;'''Strawberries hang in the balance''', CEN (June 8th, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[almond]]s. In [[Green Revolution|commercial large-scale monoculture]] [[seed production]], unlike crop production, it is of vital importance to avoid contaminating the crop with off-type seed of the same species. Therefore, selective [[herbicides]] cannot be used. Whereas bromomethane is dangerous, it is considerably safer and more effective than some other soil sterilants. Its loss to the seed industry has resulted in changes to cultural practices, with increased reliance on [[soil steam sterilization]], mechanical [[rogueing]], and [[fallow]] seasons. Bromomethane was also used as a general-purpose [[fumigant]] to kill a variety of pests including rats and insects. Bromomethane has poor fungicidal properties. Bromomethane is the only fumigant allowed (heat treatment is only other option) under [[ISPM 15]] regulations when exporting solid wood packaging (forklift pallets, crates, bracing) to ISPM 15 compliant countries. Bromomethane is used to prepare golf courses, particularly to control [[Bermuda grass]]. The Montreal Protocol stipulates that bromomethane use be phased out.

Bromomethane is also a precursor in the manufacture of other chemicals as a [[methylation|methylating]] agent, and has been used as a solvent to [[solvent extraction|extract]] oil from seeds and wool.

Bromomethane was once used in specialty [[fire extinguisher]]s, prior to the advent of less toxic halons, as it is electrically non-conductive and leaves no residue. It was used primarily for electrical substations, military aircraft, and other industrial hazards. It was never as popular as other agents due to its high cost and toxicity. Bromomethane was used from the 1920s to the 1960s, and continued to be used in aircraft engine fire suppression systems into the late 1960s.
[[File:National Methyl Bromide extinguisher.jpg|thumb|left|170px|A selection of stored-pressure bromomethane fire extinguishers, circa 1930s-40s, UK]]

==Regulation==
Bromomethane is readily [[photodissociation|photolyzed]] in the atmosphere to release elemental bromine, which is far more destructive to stratospheric ozone than chlorine. As such, it is subject to phase-out requirements of the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depleting Substances]].

The London Amendment in 1990 added bromomethane to the list of ODS to be phased out. In 2003 the Global Environment Facility approved funds for a UNEP-UNDP joint project for methyl bromide total sector phase out in seven countries in Central Europe and Central Asia, which was due for completion in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uneptie.org/ozonaction/information/mmc/lib_detail.asp?r=5315| title=Information on Commercially Validated Methyl Bromide Alternative Technologies| date=14 September 2009| publisher=UNEP| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716112416/http://www.uneptie.org/ozonaction/information/mmc/lib_detail.asp?r=5315| archivedate=2011-07-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
Many alternatives for bromomethane in the agricultural field are currently in use and further alternatives are in development, including [[propylene oxide]] and [[furfural]].&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/mbr/alts.html|title=Ozone Layer Protection &amp;#124; US EPA|website=epa.gov|accessdate=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], bromomethane is the preferred fumigant of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources for most organic goods imported into Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity/import/general-info/pre-border/afas/methyl-bromide-questions-and-answers|title=Methyl Bromide - Questions and Answers|publisher=department of Agriculture and Water Resources|accessdate=2013-11-03}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The department conducts methyl bromide fumigation certification for both domestic and foreign fumigators who can then fumigate containers destined for Australia. A list of alternative fumigants is available for goods imported from Europe (known as the BICON database), where methyl bromide fumigation has been banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daff.gov.au/biosecurity/import/general-info/pre-border/afas/methyl-bromide-questions-and-answers|title=Methyl Bromide - Questions and Answers|publisher=the department|accessdate=2011-02-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708004954/http://www.daff.gov.au/biosecurity/import/general-info/pre-border/afas/methyl-bromide-questions-and-answers|archivedate=2013-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the department allows containers from Europe to be fumigated with methyl bromide on arrival to Australia.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], bromomethane is used as a fumigant for whole logs destined for export. Environmental groups and the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] oppose its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.guardiansofthesounds.co.nz/wordpress/index.php/category/methyl-bromide/|title=Methyl Bromide Threat Again in Picton|publisher=Guardians of the Sounds|accessdate=2009-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greens.org.nz/node/20520|title=Picton residents need protection from poison fumes: Greens|last=Kedgley|first=Sue|date=2008-02-02|publisher=Green Party|accessdate=2009-02-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205160837/http://www.greens.org.nz/node/20520|archivedate=2009-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 the [[Environmental Risk Management Authority]] (ERMA) introduced new rules for its use which restrict the level of public exposure to the fumigant, set minimum buffer zones around fumigation sites, provide for notification to nearby residents and require users to monitor air quality during fumigations and report back to ERMA each year. All methyl bromide fumigations must use recapture technology by 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ermanz.govt.nz/publications-resources/topics/Methyl-bromide-fumigations/Pages/Methyl%20bromide%20fumigations.aspx| title=New rules for methyl bromide fumigations| publisher=[[Environmental Risk Management Authority]]| accessdate=2011-06-07}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]] bromomethane is regulated as a pesticide under the [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]] (FIFRA; 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.) and as a hazardous substance under the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA; 42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.), and is subject to reporting requirements under the [[Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act]] (EPCRA; 42 U.S.C. 11001 et seq.). The U.S. [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] (CAA; 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.). A 1998 amendment (P.L. 105-178, Title VI) conformed the Clean Air Act phase out date with that of the Montreal Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/spdpublc/mbr/ |title=The Phaseout of Methyl Bromide |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=2009-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017081855/http://www.epa.gov/spdpublc/mbr/ |archivedate=2009-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810044532/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=August 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the Montreal Protocol has severely restricted the use of bromomethane internationally, the United States has successfully lobbied for critical-use exemptions.&lt;ref name="Gareau2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Gareau|title=From Precaution to Profit: Contemporary Challenges to Environmental Protection in the Montreal Protocol|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xosZSlZLtsgC&amp;pg=PA232|date=29 January 2013|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-17526-4|pages=232–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical use exemptions allow the United States to continue using MeBr until it is scheduled to be completely phased out sometime in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web | url = http://www.epa.gov/ozone/mbr/cueinfo.html | title = Critical Use Exemption Information | publisher = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | accessdate = 2015-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, over 7&amp;nbsp;million pounds of bromomethane were applied in California. Applications include tomato, strawberry, and ornamental shrub growers, and fumigation of ham/pork products. Also exempt is the treatment of solid wood packaging (forklift pallets, crates, bracing), and the packaged goods, being exported to ISPM 15 countries (to include Canada in 2012).

==Health effects==
[[File:Bromomethane IR spectroscopy.svg|thumbnail|right|[[Infrared spectroscopy|IR spectrum]] of bromomethane.]]
Brief exposure to high concentrations and prolonged inhalation of lower concentrations are problematic.&lt;ref name="HitCL"&gt;Muir, GD (ed.) 1971, ''Hazards in the Chemical Laboratory'', The Royal Institute of Chemistry, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure levels leading to death vary from 1,600 to 60,000 ppm, depending on the duration of exposure (as a comparison exposure levels of 70 to 400 ppm of [[carbon monoxide]] cover the same spectrum of illness/death). Concentrations in the range of 60,000 ppm can be immediately fatal, while toxic effects can present following prolonged exposure to concentrations well under 1,000 ppm.

"A TLV–TWA of 1 ppm (3.89 mg/m3) is recommended for occupational exposure to methyl bromide"-ACGIH 8 hour time weighted average. Immediately Dangerous To Life or Health Concentration by NIOSH: "The revised IDLH for methyl bromide is 250 ppm based on acute inhalation toxicity data in humans [Clarke et al. 1945]. This may be a conservative value due to the lack of relevant acute toxicity data for workers exposed to concentrations above 220 ppm. [Note: NIOSH recommends as part of its carcinogen policy that the "most protective" respirators be worn for methyl bromide at any detectable concentration.]" Detectable concentration by Drager Tube is 0.5 ppm.

Respiratory, kidney, and neurological effects are of the greatest concern. Scientists have investigated whether bromomethane exposure was linked to the death of four New Zealand port workers who died of neuro-degenerative motor neuron disease between 2002 and 2004 and found no connection.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Treatment of wood packaging requires a concentration of up to 16,000 ppm. {{citation needed span|An Australian Customs officer died of methyl bromide poisoning while inspecting a shipping container that was fumigated in the United States|date=February 2013}}. {{citation needed span|Canada Border Services Officers avoided the same fate|date=February 2013}} because a Mexican container of granite was fumigated with 98% methyl bromide and 2% [[chloropicrin]] fumigant, the chloropicrin has a tear-gas effect.

NIOSH considers methyl bromide to be a potential occupational carcinogen as defined by the OSHA carcinogen policy [29 CFR 1990]. "Methyl bromide showed a significant dose-response relationship with prostate cancer risk."&lt;ref name="aghealth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aghealth.org|website=aghealth.org|title=Agricultural Health Study|accessdate=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excessive exposure===
Expression of toxicity following exposure may involve a latent period of several hours, followed by signs such as [[nausea]], abdominal pain, weakness, confusion, [[pulmonary edema]], and seizures. Individuals who survive the acute phase often require a prolonged convalescence. Persistent neurological deficits such as [[asthenia]], cognitive impairment, optical atrophy, and [[paresthesia]] are frequently present after moderate to severe poisoning. Blood or urine concentrations of inorganic bromide, a bromomethane metabolite, are useful to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in the forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage.&lt;ref&gt;R.

'''Cambrian Series 2''' is the unnamed 2nd series of the [[Cambrian]]. It lies above the [[Terreneuvian]] series and below the [[Miaolingian]]. Series 2 has not been formally defined by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]], lacking a precise lower boundary and subdivision into stages. The proposed lower boundary is the [[First appearance datum|first appearance]] of [[trilobites]] which is estimated to be around {{Period start|Series 2}} million years ago.&lt;ref name="GSSP Table - Paleozoic Era"&gt;{{cite web|title=GSSP Table - Paleozoic Era|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/Stratigraphy/gssp/index.php?parentid=77|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Naming==
The [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] has not named the 2nd stage of the [[Cambrian]] yet.&lt;ref name="GSSP Table - Paleozoic Era" /&gt; The new name will replace the older terms "Lower Cambrian" and "Early Cambrian". The nomenclature used in Siberia uses the term "Yakutian" for this series.&lt;ref name="13th conference"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 13th International Field Conference of the Cambrian Stage Subdivision Working Group|journal=Episodes|volume=31|issue=4|pages=440–441|url=http://www.episodes.co.in/www/backissues/314/440-442%20Confreport-Russia,%202%20(3).pdf|access-date=2012-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105184944/http://www.episodes.co.in/www/backissues/314/440-442%20Confreport-Russia,%202%20(3).pdf#|archive-date=2014-11-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdivisions==
The 2nd series is currently subdivided by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] into two stages: [[Cambrian Stage 3]] and [[Cambrian Stage 4]]. Both of these stages also lack formal definition.&lt;ref name="GSSP Table - Paleozoic Era" /&gt; The Siberian nomenclature distinguishes three stages (lowest first): [[Atdabanian]], [[Botomian]] and [[Toyonian]].&lt;ref name="13th conference" /&gt; In general most subdivisions of this series rely on biostratigraphy of [[trilobite zone]]s.&lt;ref name="Yuan 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yuan|first=J.L.|author2=Zhu, X.J. |author3=Lin, J.P. |author4= Zhu, M.Y. |title=Tentative correlation of Cambrian Series 2 between South China and other continents|journal=Bulletin of Geosciences|date=22 September 2011|pages=397–404|doi=10.3140/bull.geosci.1274|url=http://www.geology.cz/bulletin/fulltext/1274_Yuan.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biostratigraphy==
The beginning of the 2nd series of the Cambrian is marked by the appearance of [[trilobites]]. Correlating this event on different continents has proven difficult and resolving this is essential for the definition of the lower boundary of this series. Currently the oldest trilobite known is ''[[Lemdadella]]'' which marks the beginning of the ''Fallotaspis zone''.&lt;ref name="Yuan 2011" /&gt;

The end of the 2nd series of the Cambrian is marked by the first major biotic extinction of the [[Paleozoic]]. Changes in ocean chemistry and the marine environment are posited as the most likely cause of these extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Zhang, Wenhao|year=2014|title=Mass-occurrence of oncoids at the Cambrian Series 2–Series 3 transition: Implications for microbial resurgence following an Early Cambrian extinction|journal=Gondwana Research|volume=28|pages=432–450|doi=10.1016/j.gr.2014.03.015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7346">The '''Energy Technologies Institute''' ('''ETI''') is an energy research, development and demonstration body established in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2007. The government set up the ETI following an announcement in the 2006 budget speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/budget_06/bud_bud06_speech.cfm Budget 2006: Speech&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925193953/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/budget_06/bud_bud06_speech.cfm |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the ETI is to “accelerate the development, demonstration and eventual commercial deployment of a focused portfolio of energy technologies, which will increase energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help achieve energy and climate change goals”. The institute works with a range of academic and commercial bodies.

Deployment of the technologies involved, which are expected to contribute to the reduction of the UK’s [[carbon emissions]], is expected to begin around 2018.

Commentators generally welcomed the new body as likely to make a positive contribution in the efforts to minimise [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/press_releases/06-03-22_budget.htm Science Media Centre -press releases archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070313163433/http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/press_releases/06-03-22_budget.htm |date=2007-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, they pointed to the slow pace of government action in promoting [[energy conservation]] and implementing existing low-carbon technologies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grownupgreen.org.uk/library/?id=877&amp;PHPSESSID=e324f44440ed07bb6459a8cd5f3a35f7 Was Brown's Budget Green? - grownupgreen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  compared to progress in a number of other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/renewable/Story/0,,201987,00.html Renewable energy across Europe | Special reports | Guardian Unlimited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
In addition to initial funding for the ETI, the [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform|Department for Business]] will provide £50 million a year over a period of 10 years starting in 2008-09. When establishing the ETI, the government expected the separate Energy Research Partnership &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070311040609/http://www.energyresearchpartnership.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; to raise matching funding from commercial organisations.

As of September 2006 [[EDF Energy]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[BP]] and [[E.ON UK]] had committed to providing funds. By 2014, this had grown to include [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] and [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls-Royce]].

==Objectives==
Five objectives were set for the institute:
*To increase the level of research and development funding to meet the [[Energy policy of the United Kingdom|UK’s energy policy goals]].
*To deliver research and development that facilitates the rapid commercial deployment of cost-effective, low-carbon energy technologies.
*To provide better strategic focus for commercially applicable energy related research and development in the UK.
*To connect and manage networks of the best scientists and engineers to deliver focussed energy research and development projects to accelerate eventual commercial deployment.
*To build research and development capacity in the UK in the relevant technical disciplines to deliver the UK’s energy policy goals.

The ETI describes as its vision: "Affordable, secure, sustainable energy for present and future generations."

==Research focus==
The institute set out to focus research on a mixture of technologies.

As of 2014, the ETI states&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eti.co.uk/about/how_we_operate/types_of_projects/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427185929/http://www.eti.co.uk/about/how_we_operate/types_of_projects/#sthash.H71ADUdd.dpuf |archive-date=2014-04-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that typically it supports projects that:

* Develop and demonstrate system level capabilities based on novel low carbon energy technologies or services
* Create additional value through the capabilities of the ETI Industry Members and Project Partners
* Create new partnerships - improving skills, knowledge, capabilities and supply chain capacity
* Create benefit in the UK and globally - through deployment, skills, knowledge base or exports
* Reduce risk associated with novel energy systems and supply chains
* Identify barriers requiring “next generation” science and technology support
* Inform development of regulations, standards, and policy

At the same time, the institute focuses on a mix of technologies to increase security of supply, and solutions to address [[fuel poverty]].

In 2017 the ETI started the Nuclear Cost Drivers Project, which aims to identify cost reductions in nuclear power plant design, construction and operation, so enabling more widespread deployment of new nuclear.&lt;ref name=wnn-20171027&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-UK-study-aims-to-identify-nuclear-cost-reductions-2710174.html |title=UK study aims to identify nuclear cost reductions |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=27 October 2017 |accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Historically, since the privatisation of the country's energy industries, public sector support for energy research and development in the UK has come from a variety of bodies with little co-ordination between them. Problems experienced as a result of this included poor continuity of funding, and the availability of funding for certain parts of the research-development-commercialisation process but not others. Funding levels have also been low by international standards.

==Location==

In September 2007 it was announced that the Midlands Consortium had been chosen to host the ETI. The consortium comprises the Universities of Birmingham, Loughborough and Nottingham with financial support from Advantage West Midlands and the East Midlands Development Agency. 
The hub of the ETI is based at [[Loughborough University]], on the Holywell Park area of the campus, at the heart of the University's Science and Enterprise Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscentre.bham.ac.uk/press/2007/09/ETI_consortium_bid_20_09_07.shtml ETI Bid Press Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum mechanics]], [[energy]] is defined in terms of the '''energy operator''', acting on the [[wave function]] of the system as a consequence of [[time translation symmetry]].

==Definition==

It is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Quantum Mechanics Demystified, D. McMahon, Mc Graw Hill (USA), 2006, {{ISBN|0-07-145546-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{E} = i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

It acts on the wave function (the [[probability amplitude]] for different [[Configuration space (physics)|configurations]] of the system)

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Application==

The energy operator [[correspondence principle|corresponds]] to the full energy of a system. The [[Schrödinger equation]] describes the space- and time-dependence of the slow changing (non-[[theory of relativity|relativistic]]) wave function of a quantum system. The solution of this equation for a bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an [[energy level]]) which results in the concept of [[quantum|quanta]].

===Schrödinger equation===
Using the energy operator to the [[Schrödinger equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) = \hat H \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

can be obtained:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp; \hat{E}\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) = \hat{H} \Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]], ''ħ'' is the [[reduced Planck constant]], and &lt;math&gt;\hat H&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] [[operator (physics)|operator]].

In a [[stationary state]] additionally occurs the time-independent [[Schrödinger equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp; E \Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is an [[eigenvalue]] of energy.
===Klein–Gordon equation===

The [[Mass in special relativity#The relativistic energy-momentum equation|relativistic mass-energy relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where again ''E'' = total energy, ''p'' = total 3-[[momentum]] of the particle, ''m'' = [[invariant mass]], and ''c'' = [[speed of light]], can similarly yield the [[Klein–Gordon equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp; \hat{E}^2 = c^2\hat{p}^2 + (mc^2)^2 \\
&amp; \hat{E}^2\Psi = c^2\hat{p}^2\Psi + (mc^2)^2\Psi \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial t^2} =  c^2\nabla^2\Psi - \left(\frac{mc^2}{\hbar}\right)^2\Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation==

The energy operator is easily derived from using the [[free particle]] wave function ([[plane wave]] solution to Schrödinger's equation).&lt;ref&gt;Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles (2nd Edition), R. Resnick, R. Eisberg, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1985, {{ISBN|978-0-471-87373-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in one dimension the wave function is

:&lt;math&gt; \Psi = e^{i(kx-\omega t)} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The time derivative of ''Ψ'' is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -i \omega e^{i(kx-\omega t)} = - i \omega \Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

By the [[De Broglie relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; E=\hbar \omega \,\!&lt;/math&gt;,

we have

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = - i \frac{E}{\hbar} \Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Re-arranging the equation leads to

:&lt;math&gt; E\Psi = i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;,

where the energy factor ''E'' is a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] value, the energy the particle has and the value that is measured. The [[partial derivative]] is a [[linear operator]] so this expression ''is'' the operator for energy:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{E} = i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial t} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

It can be concluded that the scalar ''E'' is the [[eigenvalue]] of the operator, while &lt;math&gt; \hat{E} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the operator. Summarizing these results:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{E}\Psi = i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\Psi=E\Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For a 3-d plane wave

:&lt;math&gt; \Psi = e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

the derivation is exactly identical, as no change is made to the term including time and therefore the time derivative. Since the [[linear operator|operator is linear]], they are valid for any [[linear combination]] of plane waves, and so they can act on any wave function without affecting the properties of the wave function or operators. Hence this must be true for any wave function. It turns out to work even in [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], such as the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] above.

'''Ferret''' is an interactive computer [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] and analysis environment designed to meet the needs of [[oceanographer]]s and [[meteorologist]]s analyzing large and complex gridded data sets. Ferret offers a Mathematica-like approach to analysis; new variables may be defined interactively as mathematical expressions involving data set variables. Calculations may be applied over arbitrarily shaped regions. Fully documented [[graphics]] are produced with a single command. It runs on most [[Unix]] and [[Linux]] systems using [[X Window]] for display, and on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] XP/NT/9x.

'''Hydrography''' is the branch of applied sciences which deals with the measurement and description of the physical features of oceans, [[sea]]s, coastal areas, [[lake]]s and [[river]]s, as well as with the prediction of their change over time, for the primary purpose of safety of navigation and in support of all other marine activities, including economic development, security and defence, scientific research, and environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iho.int/srv1/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=299&amp;Itemid=289|title=  International Hydrographic Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Alexander Dalrymple AGE V07 1801.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexander Dalrymple]], the first [[Hydrographer of the Navy]] in the [[United Kingdom]], appointed in 1795.]] 
The origins of hydrography lay in the making of charts to aid navigation, by individual mariners as they navigated into new waters. These were usually the private property, even closely held secrets, of individuals who used them for [[Commerce|commercial]] or [[military]] advantage. As transoceanic trade and exploration increased, [[hydrographic survey]]s started to be carried out as an exercise in their own right, and the commissioning of surveys was increasingly done by governments and special hydrographic offices. National organizations, particularly [[navies]], realized that the collection, systematization and distribution of this knowledge gave it great organizational and military advantages. Thus were born dedicated national hydrographic organizations for the collection, organization, publication and distribution of hydrography incorporated into charts and sailing directions.


Prior to the establishment of the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office]], [[Royal Navy]] captains were responsible for the provision of their own charts. In practice this meant that ships often sailed with inadequate information for safe navigation, and that when new areas were surveyed, the data rarely reached all those who needed it.  The [[Admiralty]] appointed [[Alexander Dalrymple]] as [[Hydrographer of the Navy|Hydrographer]] in 1795, with a remit to gather and distribute charts to HM Ships. Within a year existing charts from the previous two centuries had been collated, and the first catalogue published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukho.gov.uk/AboutUs/Documents/timeline.pdf |title=The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office timeline |publisher=UKHO |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721202405/http://www.ukho.gov.uk/AboutUs/Documents/timeline.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first chart produced under the direction of the [[Admiralty]], was a chart of [[Quiberon Bay]] in [[Brittany]], and it appeared in 1800.

Under Captain [[Thomas Hurd]] the department received its first professional guidelines, and the first catalogues were published and made available to the public and to other nations as well. In 1829, Rear-Admiral [[Francis Beaufort|Sir Francis Beaufort]], as Hydrographer, developed the eponymous [[Beaufort Scale|Scale]], and introduced the first official [[tide table]]s in 1833 and the first "[[Notice to Mariners|Notices to Mariners]]" in 1834. The Hydrographic Office underwent steady expansion throughout the 19th century; by 1855, the Chart Catalogue listed 1,981 charts giving a definitive coverage over the entire world, and produced over 130,000 charts annually, of which about half were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukho.gov.uk/corp/History.asp |title=Charting the world for over 200 years |publisher=UKHO |work=www.ukho.gov.uk |accessdate=2006-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925132626/http://www.ukho.gov.uk/corp/History.asp |archivedate=2006-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''hydrography'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ὕδωρ (''hydor''), "water" and γράφω (''graphō''), "to write".

==Overview==
[[File:A plan of Milford Haven in the county of Pembroke south Wales.gif|thumb|right|250px|Survey of the strategic port of [[Milford Haven]] produced by [[Lewis Morris (1701–1765)|Lewis Morris]] in 1748]] 
Large-scale hydrography is usually undertaken by national or international organizations which sponsor data collection through precise surveys and publish charts and descriptive material for navigational purposes. The science of oceanography is, in part, an outgrowth of classical hydrography. In many respects the data are interchangeable, but marine hydrographic data will be particularly directed toward marine navigation and safety of that navigation. Marine resource exploration and exploitation is a significant application of hydrography, principally focused on the search for [[hydrocarbon]]s.

Hydrographical measurements include the [[tides|tidal]], [[Ocean currents|current]] and [[wave]] information of physical oceanography. They include [[seafloor|bottom]] measurements, with particular emphasis on those marine geographical features that pose a hazard to navigation such as rocks, [[shoal]]s, [[reef]]s and other features that obstruct [[ship]] passage. Bottom measurements also include collection of the nature of the bottom as it pertains to effective anchoring. Unlike oceanography, hydrography will include shore features, natural and manmade, that aid in navigation. Therefore, a [[hydrographic survey]] may include the accurate positions and representations of [[hill]]s, [[mountain]]s and even lights and [[tower]]s that will aid in fixing a ship's position, as well as the physical aspects of the sea and seabed.

Hydrography, mostly for reasons of safety, adopted a number of conventions that have affected its portrayal of the data on nautical charts. For example, hydrographic charts are designed to portray what is safe for navigation, and therefore will usually tend to maintain least [[:wikt:depth|depth]]s and occasionally de-emphasize the actual submarine [[topography]] that would be portrayed on [[bathymetric chart]]s. The former are the [[mariner]]'s tools to avoid accident. The latter are best representations of the actual seabed, as in a topographic map, for scientific and other purposes. Trends in hydrographic practice since c.&amp;nbsp;2003–2005 have led to a narrowing of this difference, with many more [[Hydrographic Office|hydrographic offices]] maintaining "best observed" databases, and then making navigationally "safe" products as required.  This has been coupled with a preference for multi-use surveys, so that the same data collected for nautical charting purposes can also be used for bathymetric portrayal.

[[File:HMS Waterwitch, formally Lancashire Witch.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|[[HMS Waterwitch (1892)|HMS Waterwitch]], a hydrographic survey vessel]]
Even though, in places, hydrographic survey data may be collected in sufficient detail to portray bottom topography in some areas, [[hydrographic chart]]s only show depth information relevant for safe navigation and should not be considered as a product that accurately portrays the actual shape of the bottom.  The soundings selected from the raw source depth data for placement on the nautical chart are selected for safe navigation and are biased to show predominately the shallowest depths that relate to safe navigation. For instance, if there is a deep area that can not be reached because it is surrounded by shallow water, the deep area may not be shown. The color filled areas that show different ranges of shallow water are not the equivalent of contours on a topographic map since they are often drawn seaward of the actual shallowest depth portrayed. A bathymetric chart does show marine topology accurately. Details covering the above limitations can be found in Part&amp;nbsp;1 of [[Bowditch's American Practical Navigator]]. Another concept that affects safe navigation is the sparsity of detailed depth data from high resolution sonar systems.  In more remote areas, the only available depth information has been collected with lead lines. This collection method drops a weighted line to the bottom at intervals and records the depth, often from a rowboat or sail boat. There is no data between soundings or between sounding lines to guarantee that there is not a hazard such as a wreck or a coral head waiting there to ruin a sailor's day. Often, the navigation of the collecting boat does not match today's GPS navigational accuracies. The hydrographic chart will use the best data available and will caveat its nature in a caution note or in the legend of the chart.

A hydrographic survey is quite different  from a bathymetric survey in some important respects, particularly in a bias toward least depths due to the safety requirements of the former and [[geomorphology|geomorphologic]] descriptive requirements of the latter.  Historically, this could include [[Echo sounding|echosoundings]] being conducted under settings biased toward least depths, but in modern practice hydrographic surveys typically attempt to best measure the depths observed, with the adjustments for navigational safety being applied after the fact.

Hydrography of [[stream]]s will include information on the stream bed, [[Environmental flow|flow]]s, [[water quality]] and surrounding land. [[Drainage basin|Basin]] or interior hydrography pays special attention to [[rivers]] and [[potable water]] although if collected data is not for ship navigational uses, and is intended for scientific usage, it is more commonly called ''[[hydrology]]''.

Hydrography of rivers and streams is also an integral part of water management. Most reservoirs in the United States use dedicated stream gauging and rating tables to determine inflows into the reservoir and outflows to irrigation districts, water municipalities and other users of captured water. River/stream hydrographers use handheld and bank mounted devices, to capture a sectional flow rate of moving water through a section and or current.

==Organizations==
{{main|Hydrography organizations}}

Hydrographic services in most countries are carried out by specialised [[hydrographic office]]s. The international coordination of hydrographic efforts lies with the [[International Hydrographic Organization]].

The [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office]] is one of the oldest, supplying a wide range of charts covering the globe to other countries, allied military organisations and the public.

In the United States, the hydrographic charting function has been carried out since 1807 by the [[Office of Coast Survey]] of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] within the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Department of Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/staff/aboutus.htm|title=  About Coast Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''JPSS-2''', or Joint Polar Satellite System-2, is the second of the United States [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s latest generation of U.S. polar-orbiting, non-geosynchronous, environmental satellites called the [[Joint Polar Satellite System]]. JPSS-2 is to be launched 2022 and join [[NOAA-20]] the [[Suomi NPP|Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership]] satellite in the same orbit. Circling the Earth from pole-to-pole, it will cross the equator about 14 times daily, providing full global coverage twice a day.&lt;ref name="MissAndInst"/&gt;

JPSS-2 will provide operational continuity of satellite-based observations and products for NOAA Polar-Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) and Suomi NPP satellite and ground systems.&lt;ref name="MissAndInst"/&gt; The baseline plan for JPSS Ground System will be sustained to support JPSS-2, similar to NOAA-20. The JPSS-2 spacecraft will host the following instruments: (1) VIIRS, (2) CrIS, (3) ATMS, and (4) OMPS-N. It was at one time intended to carry the [[Radiation Budget Instrument]] (RBI) but NASA cancelled that project in 2018.&lt;ref name="RBInomore"&gt;{{cite news|title=NASA Cancels Earth Science Sensor Set for 2021 Launch|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-cancels-earth-science-sensor-set-for-2021-launch|accessdate=14 February 2018|date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
On March 24, 2015, NASA announced that Orbital ATK would build one, and possibly three, Joint Polar Satellite System spacecraft. In winning the contract, Orbital unseated the incumbent [[Ball Aerospace]] which had built NOAA-20 (JPSS-1) and [[Suomi NPP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Orbital ATK Wrests JPSS Business From Ball|url=http://spacenews.com/orbital-atk-snatches-jpss-business-from-ball/|accessdate=13 February 2018|work=Space News|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; JPSS-2 is based on Orbital ATK’s LEOStar-3 spacecraft bus platform, which was also used on [[Landsat 8]]. The second Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation satellite ([[ICESat-2]]) and the [[Landsat 9]] spacecraft are also based on the LEOStar-3 and are being built at Orbital ATK’s Gilbert facility at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Datta|first1=Anasuya|title=Orbital ATK to start manufacturing Landsat 9 as spacecraft passes critical design review|url=https://www.geospatialworld.net/blogs/orbital-atk-to-start-manufacturing-landsat-9/|accessdate=22 March 2018|date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch services contract was awarded to United Launch Alliance on March 3, 2017.&lt;ref name="contract"/&gt;

== Launch ==
JPSS-2 is scheduled to launch in 2022 Atlas V 401 rocket from Space Launch Complex 3E at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.&lt;ref name="contract"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cole|first1=Steve|title=NASA Awards Launch Services Contract for Joint Polar Satellite System-2 Mission|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-launch-services-contract-for-joint-polar-satellite-system-2-mission|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=JPSS Launch |url=http://www.jpss.noaa.gov/launch.html |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite]] (VIIRS): takes global visible and infrared observations of land, ocean, and atmosphere parameters at high temporal resolution. Developed from the [[MODIS]] instrument flown on the Aqua and Terra [[Earth Observing System]] satellites, it has significantly better performance than the [[AVHRR]] radiometer previously flown on NOAA satellites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jointmission.gsfc.nasa.gov/viirs.html "The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite."] ''NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center.'' Retrieved: 22 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
;Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS): The CrIS instrument will be used to produce high-resolution, three-dimensional moisture, pressure, and temperature profiles. These profiles will help scientists to enhance weather forecasting models, and will be used in both short- and long-term weather forecasting. They will help improve the understanding of regular climate phenomena such as [[El Niño]] and [[La Niña]]. This is a brand-new instrument with breakthrough performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jointmission.gsfc.nasa.gov/cris.html "The Cross-track Infrared Sounder."] ''NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center.'' Retrieved: 22 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; CrIS represents a significant enhancement over NOAA's legacy infrared sounder—High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounders (HIRS) and is meant to be a counterpart to the [[Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer]] (IASI).
;Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS): ATMS is a cross-track scanner with 22 channels. It provides sounding observations needed to retrieve atmospheric moisture and temperature profiles for real-time civilian weather forecasting and to provide continuity of these measurements for climate monitoring. It is a lighter-weight version of the previous [[Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit|AMSU]] and [[Microwave Humidity Sounder|MHS]] instruments flown on previous NOAA and NASA satellites with no new performance capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jointmission.gsfc.nasa.gov/atms.html The Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder] ''NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center.'' Retrieved: 22 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite]] (OMPS): OMPS is a suite of three [[hyperspectral]] instruments that is extending the 25-plus year total-ozone and ozone-profile records. Ozone-assessment researchers and policy makers use these records to track the health of the ozone layer. Better testing and monitoring of the complex chemistry involved in ozone destruction near the troposphere is made possible by the improved vertical resolution of OMPS data products. OMPS products, when used with cloud predictions, also produce better ultraviolet index forecasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jointmission.gsfc.nasa.gov/omps.html "Ozone Mapper Profiler Suite."] ''NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center.'' Retrieved: 22 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; OMPS carries on a long tradition of space borne measurements of ozone beginning in 1970 with the Nimbus 4 satellite and continuing with the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV and SBUV/2), [[Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer]] (TOMS) and [[Ozone Monitoring Instrument]] (OMI) instruments on various NASA, NOAA, and international satellites. Over the more than 30-year period in which these instruments have been operating, they have provided a very detailed and important long-term record of the global distribution of ozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS)|url=https://jointmission.gsfc.nasa.gov/omps.html|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discontinued instruments:

;Radiation Budget Instrument (RBI): RBI was a planned scanning radiometer capable of measuring Earth's reflected sunlight and emitted thermal radiation.  RBI was to fly on JPSS-2, but it experienced significant technical issues and substantial cost growth. Because of these challenges, and the low risk of experiencing a gap in this data record due to having two relatively new instruments in orbit at the time, NASA decided to discontinue development of RBI.&lt;ref name="RBInomore"/&gt; RBI struggled from the beginning. It was originally to be on NOAA's proposed Polar Free Flyer satellite, but in 2014, Congress, led by its Republican majority, refused to fund the satellite. After moving the instrument to JPSS-2 and awarding the contract for development in June 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scharmann|first1=Rachel|title=Exelis Secures Contract for NASA Radiation Budget Instrument|url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/regional/2014/06/03/exelis-secures-contract-for-nasa-radiation-budget-instrument/|accessdate=14 February 2018|date=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA almost immediately began the process of dropping the sensor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7784">'''Jamaican dry forests''' are [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|subtropical dry forests]] located in southern Jamaica.  The most extensive dry forests are in the [[limestone]] hills of the [[Hellshire Hills]] in [[Saint Catherine Parish, Jamaica|St. Catherine]] and [[Portland Ridge]] in [[Clarendon Parish, Jamaica|Clarendon]] in southern [[Jamaica]].  These areas are dry because they lie in the [[orography|orographic]] [[rain shadow]] of the [[Blue Mountains (Jamaica)|Blue Mountains]].  The Hellshire Hills have been described as one of the last substantial areas of primary, undisturbed dry forest in the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;Vogel P., Nelson R. and Kerr R. 1995. Conservation strategy for the Jamaican iguana, Cyclura collie. Contributions to West Indian Herpetology: a Tribute to Albert Schwartz. In:Powell R. and Henderson R.W. (eds), Contributions to
Herpetology, Vol. 12. Society for the Study of Amphibiansand Reptiles, Ithaca, New York, pp. 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamaican dry forests are dominated by plants in the [[Rubiaceae]], the [[Euphorbiaceae]] and the [[Myrtaceae]].  In this regard they are similar to [[Puerto Rican dry forests]], but differ sharply from dry forests on the mainland of [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]] which are dominated by the [[Fabaceae]] and the [[Bignoniaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, A.H. (1995) Diversity and floristic composition of neotropical dry forests.  Pp. 146-194 ''in'' S.H. Bullock, H.A. Mooney and E. Medina (editors) ''Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests''.  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 271 plant species have been reported from the Hellshire Hills, including 53 species [[Endemism|endemic]] to Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;Espeut P (1999) [http://www.unesco.org/csi/act/jamaica/jamai1.htm Portland Bight–Jamaica’s newest protected area].

University of the West Indies, Mona, Jamaica.&lt;/ref&gt;  McLaren and coauthors (2005) found forests in the Hellshire Hills to be dominated by ''[[Drypetes]] [[Drypetes lateriflora|lateriflora]]'', ''[[Metopium brownei]]'', ''[[Bauhinia]] [[Bauhinia divaricata|divaricata]]'' and ''[[Krugiodendron ferreum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, K.P., M.A. McDonald, J.B. Hall and J.R. Healey. 2005. Predicting species response to disturbance from size class distributions of adults and saplings in a Jamaican tropical dry forest. Plant Ecology 181:69–84&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the remaining Jamaican dry forest lies within the [[Portland Bight Protected Area]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandbight.com.jm/ Portland Bight Protected Area website]&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the [[Portland Ridge]] and the [[Hellshire Hills]], which are the best-studied areas of Jamaican dry forest.  The endangered [[Jamaican iguana]] (''Cyclura collei'') is restricted to dry forests in the Hellshire Hills.  The endemic tree frog ''[[Eleutherodactylus cavernicola]]'', two endemic [[Thunder snake]]s, ''[[Trophidophis stullae]]'' and ''[[Trophidophis jamaicencis]]'', and the endemic Blue-Tailed [[Celestus|Galliwasp]] (''[[Celestus duquesneyi]]'')  are restricted to the Portland Ridge.  Other endemic species present in the area include the Jamaican boa (''[[Chilabothrus subflavus]]''), the Common Snake (''[[Typhlops]] [[Typhlops jamaicencis|jamaicencis]]''), the Grass Snake (''[[Arrhyton]] [[Arrhyton calillaemums|calillaemums]]''), the [[Jamaican Coney]] (''Geocapromys brownii'') and 11 endemic subspecies of birds.  The last Jamaican populations of the skink ''[[Mabuya]] [[Mabuya mabouya|mabouya]]'' are believed to be in the Hellshire Hills.

'''James Alden Jr.''' (March 31, 1810 – February 6, 1877) was a [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] in the [[United States Navy]]. In the Mexican–American War he participated in the captures of Veracruz, Tuxpan and Tabasco. Fighting on the Union side in the Civil War, he took part in the relief of Fort Pickens, followed by many engagements on the Lower Mississippi, before being promoted Captain of USS Brooklyn and assisting in the Union victory in the Battle of Mobile Bay.

==Early career==
Alden was born in [[Portland, Maine]], and was a direct descendant of [[John Alden]], a [[Mayflower]] pilgrim. He was appointed [[midshipman]] on April 1, 1828 and spent the initial years of his naval career ashore at the Naval Station in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] before he served in the Mediterranean squadron on board the sloop of war [[USS John Adams (1799)|USS ''John Adams'']]. Promoted to passed midshipman on June 14, 1834, Alden then served at the [[Boston Navy Yard]] until he was assigned to the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under Lieutenant [[Charles Wilkes]].

During the course of this voyage (1838–1842), the officers and men of the expedition were transferred freely from one vessel to another; Alden, promoted to lieutenant on February 25, 1841, concluded the cruise as [[executive officer]] of the sloop [[USS Porpoise (1836)|USS ''Porpoise'']]. He saw action at Malolo, in the [[Fiji]] Islands, on July 26, 1840, in the [[punitive expedition]] against the tribe which had murdered Lieutenant Joseph Underwood and Midshipman [[Wilkes Henry]], the latter a nephew of the expedition's leader, two days before.

After another tour of duty at the naval station at Boston, Alden was assigned to [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']], and circumnavigated the globe in the [[frigate]] during her cruise under [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[John Percival|John ("Mad Jack") Percival]]. While serving therein, he commanded a boat expedition that cut out several war junks from under the guns of a fort at [[Zuron Bay]], [[Cochin China]]. Later serving in the Home Squadron during the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846), Alden, an adept surveyor, participated in the captures of [[Veracruz]], [[Tuxpan]] and [[Tabasco]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Who Was Who in American History - the Military|date=1975|publisher=Marquis Who's Who|location=Chicago|isbn=0837932017|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coast Survey==
Following the war with Mexico, Alden served as inspector of provisions and clothing at Boston until detached from this duty on May 18, 1849 to go to Washington, D.C., and report to the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] for duty with the [[United States Coast Survey]]. From the summer of 1849 to the late winter of 1851, he commanded, in succession, the Coast Survey steamers ''John Y. Mason'' and ''Walker'' in survey duty off the eastern seaboard. Assigned to duty on the Pacific coast thereafter, Alden traveled to San Francisco where he replaced [[William Pope McArthur]] as commander of the Coast Survey Schooner ''Ewing''. He arrived in May, 1851&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/coastsurveyvol1/BACHE6.html|title=The Frontier Coast|website=NOAA Central Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; and surveyed from San Francisco to San Diego, reporting on the expedition from San Francisco on February 17, 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, Showing the Progress of the Survey during 1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbJOAAAAcAAJ| pages=104–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Active''===
In 1852, he assumed command of the Coast Survey steamer [[USC&amp;GS Active (1852)|''Active'']],&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; purchased to replace the wrecked ''Jefferson'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/research-guides/z-files/zb-files/zb-files-a/alden-james.html|title=James Alden|website= Naval History and Heritage Command}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the ''Ewing'' was temporarily abandoned,&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Oscar|title=George Davidson: Pioneer West Coast Scientist|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|year=1954|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and carried out survey work off the [[United States West Coast]] into 1860. During this time, on September 1, 1855, he was promoted to commander. Indian disturbances in the [[Washington Territory]] in January 1856 highlighted Alden's tour of duty in command of ''Active''; and his ship, joining the sloop-of-war [[USS Decatur (1839)|USS ''Decatur'']] and the steamer [[USS Massachusetts (1845)|USS ''Massachusetts'']], proved "of great service" during those troubled times. ''Active'' operated in the headwaters of [[Puget Sound]], where her presence reassured the settlers. In the summer of 1859, during tensions incident to an American's killing a Britisher's pig on [[San Juan Island]], ''Active''{{'}}s timely arrival at that isle apparently helped to quiet a potentially dangerous situation in what became later known as the "[[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]]."

==U.S. Civil War==
[[File:JamesAlden.jpg|thumb|200px|James Alden Jr.]]
The outbreak of the [[U.S. Civil War]] in the spring of 1861 found Alden in command of the steamer [[USS South Carolina (1860)|USS ''South Carolina'']], in which he participated in the relief of [[Fort Pickens]]. Next given the steam sloop [[USS Richmond (1860)|USS ''Richmond'']], Alden commanded that ship in the passage of [[Fort Jackson (Louisiana)|Fort Jackson]] and [[Fort St. Philip]], and in the engagements with Confederate batteries at [[Chalmette, Louisiana]], twice passing the southern guns at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], and in the battle at [[Port Hudson, Louisiana]].

Promoted to captain on January 2, 1863, Alden next assumed command of the steam sloop [[USS Brooklyn (1858)|USS ''Brooklyn'']], and led that ship in the action with [[Fort Gaines (Alabama)|Fort Gaines]] and [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Fort Morgan]] and with the Confederate gunboats in the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]]. While ''Brooklyn'' was being sent north for repairs, she was attached to the naval forces gathering off [[Fort Fisher|Fort Fisher, North Carolina]], and took part in both assaults on that Confederate bastion.

==Promotion and late career==
Promoted to [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]] on July 25, 1866, Alden, over the next two years, commanded, in succession, the steam sloop [[USS Susquehanna (1847)|USS ''Susquehanna'']] and the steam frigate [[USS Minnesota (1855)|USS ''Minnesota'']] before he was given the commandantcy of the [[Mare Island Navy Yard]]. Appointed Chief of the Bureau of Navigation in April 1869, Alden—promoted to rear admiral on June 19, 1871—returned to sea in 1871 with orders to command the naval force on the European Station.

Departing New York in his flagship, [[USS Wabash (1855)|USS ''Wabash'']], on November 17, 1871, Alden relieved Rear Admiral [[Charles S. Boggs]] at [[Villefranche-sur-Mer|Villefranche]], France, on January 1, 1872. Although placed on the retired list on March 31, 1872, Alden remained on active duty commanding the European Fleet until relieved by Rear Admiral [[A. Ludlow Case]] at Villefranche on June 2, 1873. His last tour of duty afloat completed, he sailed home in his former command, ''Brooklyn''.

Alden died at San Francisco on February 6, 1877,&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; but was buried in his native Portland on February 24, 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6182144|title=James Alden (1810 - 1877) - Find A Grave Memorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Namesake==
The U.S. Navy [[destroyer]] [[USS Alden (DD-211)|USS ''Alden'']] was named for him.

'''Jarrah forest''' is tall open [[forest]] in which the dominant overstory tree is ''[[Eucalyptus marginata]]'' (jarrah). The ecosystem occurs only in the [[Southwest Botanical Province]] of [[Western Australia]]. It is most common in the biogeographic region named in consequence [[Jarrah Forest]].

Most jarrah forest contains at least one other co-dominant overstory tree; association with ''[[Corymbia calophylla]]'' is especially common, and results in which is sometimes referred to as '''jarrah-marri forest'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17661">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Massachusetts''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of November 29, 2010, there were 31 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One additional site is currently proposed for entry on the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  Four sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

The following is a '''list of ecoregions in Sri Lanka'''. Due to High rainfall and even sunlight throughout the year, [[Sri Lanka]] exhibits a great variety in [[ecoregion]]s in all living habitats. Together with [[Western Ghats]], [[Sri Lanka]] forms Western Ghats and Sri Lanka [[Biodiversity hotspot|hotspot]]. It is considered one of the eight super-hotspots.&lt;ref name="hotspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdn.ac.lk/socs/zaup/reptiles/srilanka.html|title=Sri Lanka - a world Reptile Hotspot|last=Somaweera|first=Ruchira|year=2004|work=pdn.ac.lk|publisher=[[University of Peradeniya]]|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ecorigions also included in [[Global 200]] list too.

This is largely due to uncertainties in [[radiometric dating]] and the problem that deposits suitable for radiometric dating seldom occur exactly at the places in the geologic column where they would be most useful. The dates and errors quoted above are according to the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] 2012 time scale. Where errors are not quoted, errors are less than the precision of the age given. Dates labeled with a * indicate boundaries where a [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]] has been internationally agreed upon: see [[List of Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points]] for a complete list.&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Middle Miocene disruption|M. Miocene disruption]] (14.8-14.5)&lt;ref&gt;14.8 to 14.5 million years ago, during the Langhian. A major and permanent cooling step occurred between 14.8 and 14.1 Ma, associated with increased production of cold Antarctic deep waters and a major growth of the East Antarctic ice sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Columbia River Basalt Group|{{fontcolor|red || Columbia River Basalt Group}}]]&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia River Basalt Group is thought to be a potential link to the Chilcotin Group. The flows can be divided into four major categories: The Steens Basalt, Grande Ronde Basalt, the Wanapum Basalt, and the Saddle Mountains Basalt. The Columbia River flood basalt province comprises more than 300 individual basalt lava flows that have an average volume of 500 to 600 cubic kilometres. The Steens Basalt captured a highly detailed record of the earth’s magnetic reversal that occurred roughly 15 million years ago. Over a 10,000 year period, more than 130 flows solidified – roughly one flow every 75 years. Most of the flows froze with a single magnetic orientation. However, several of the flows captured substantial variations in magnetic field direction as they froze. One geomagnetic field reversal occurred during the Steens Basalt eruptions at approximately 16.7 Ma, as dated using 40Ar/39Ar ages and the geomagnetic polarity timescale. The Imnaha lavas have been dated using the K–Ar technique, and show a broad range of dates. The oldest is 17.67±0.32 Ma with younger lava flows ranging to 15.50±0.40 Ma. The next oldest of the flows, from 17 million to 15.6 million years ago, make up the Grande Ronde Basalt. The Wanapum Basalt is made up of the Eckler Mountain Member (15.6 million years ago), the Frenchman Springs Member (15.5 million years ago), the Roza Member (14.9 million years ago) and the Priest Rapids Member (14.5 million years ago). The Saddle Mountains Basalt, seen prominently at the Saddle Mountains, is made up of the Umatilla Member flows, the Wilbur Creek Member flows, the Asotin Member flows (13 million years ago), the Weissenfels Ridge Member flows, the Esquatzel Member flows, the Elephant Mountain Member flows (10.5 million years ago), the Bujford Member flows, the Ice Harbor Member flows (8.5 million years ago) and the Lower Monumental Member flows (6 million years ago). Eruptions were most vigorous from 17–14 million years ago, when over 99% of the basalt was released. Less extensive eruptions continued from 14–6 million years ago.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Chilcotin Group|Chilcotin Plateau Basalts]]&lt;ref name="Chilcotin"&gt;Eruptions were most vigorous 6-10 million years ago and 2-3 million years ago, when most of the basalt was released. Less extensive eruptions continued 0.01 to 1.6 million years ago. The Chilcotin Group were thought to potentially be linked to the Columbia River Basalt Group in the United States, which are coeval and lie across parts of the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho to the south.[3] However, its morphology and geochemistry have been proven much similar to other volcanic plateaus such as the Snake River Plain in Idaho and parts of Iceland. http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/e89-078?journalCode=cjes#.UTUS4VejIqc K–Ar whole-rock dates demonstrate that several ages of basalt are represented, from Early Miocene (or even Late Oligocene?) to Early Pleistocene, with particularly abundant eruptions about 14–16, 9–6, and 1–3 Ma ago&lt;/ref&gt;

http://petrology.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/4/793.full
According to Hofmann et al. (1997), most of the Ethiopian flood basalts erupted 30 Myr ago, during a short 1 Myr period, to form a vast volcanic plateau. Immediately after this peak of activity, a number of large shield volcanoes developed on the surface of the volcanic plateau, after which subsequent volcanism was largely confined to regions of rifting (Mohr, 1983a; Mohr &amp; Zanettin, 1988). The rift that opened along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden separated the Arabian and African continents, and isolated a small portion of the volcanic plateau in Yemen and Saudi Arabia (Chazot &amp; Bertrand, 1993; Baker et al., 1996a; Menzies et al., 2001). Volcanic activity continues to the present day along the Ethiopian and Afar rifts.&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Iceland hotspot]]&lt;ref&gt;it is speculated that the present day Iceland hotspot originated as a mantle plume on the Alpha Ridge (Arctic Ocean) ca. 130-120 Ma, migrated down Ellesmere Island, through Baffin Island, onto the west coast of Greenland, and finally arrived on the east coast of Greenland by ca. 60 Ma&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;

| [[Chicxulub Crater]] (65.5 ± 0.3)&lt;ref&gt;The age of Chicxulub asteroid impact and the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (65.5 ± 0.3) coincide precisely. Even the most energetic known volcanic eruption, which released approximately 240 gigatons of TNT (1.0×1021 J) and created the La Garita Caldera, was substantially less powerful than the Chicxulub impact.  Gerta Keller of Princeton University argues that recent core samples from Chicxulub prove the impact occurred about 300,000 years before the mass extinction.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Deccan Traps]] (65.5 ± 0.3)&lt;ref&gt;The Deccan Traps formed between 60 and 68 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period. The bulk of the volcanic eruption occurred at the Western Ghats (near Mumbai) some 65 million years ago. This series of eruptions may have lasted less than 30,000 years in total. The motion of the Indian tectonic plate and the eruptive history of the Deccan traps show strong correlations. Based on data from marine magnetic profiles, a pulse of unusually rapid plate motion begins at the same time as the first pulse of Deccan flood basalts, which is dated at 67 Myr ago. The spreading rate rapidly increased and reached a maximum at the same time as the peak basaltic eruptions. The spreading rate then dropped off, with the decrease occurring around 63 Myr ago, by which time the main phase of Deccan volcanism ended.&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Central Atlantic magmatic province]] (199.5±0.5)&lt;ref name="CAMP"&gt;Ages were determined by 40Ar/39Ar analysis on plagioclase (Knight et al. 2004), (Verati et al. 2007), (Marzoli et al. 2004). These data show indistinguishable ages (199.5±0.5 Ma) from Lower to Upper lava flows, from central to northern Morocco. Therefore the CAMP is an intense and short magmatic event. Basalts of the Recurrent unit are slightly younger (mean age: 197±1 Ma) and represent a late event. According to magnetostratigraphic data, the Moroccan CAMP were divided into five groups, differing in paleomagnetic orientations(declination and inclination) (Knight et al. 2004). Each group is composed by a smaller number of lava flows (i.e., a lower volume) than the preceding one. These data suggest that the CAMP were created by five short magma pulses and eruption events, each one possibly &lt;400 (?) years long. All lava flow sequences are characterized by normal polarity, except for a brief paleomagnetic reversal yielded by one lava flow and by a localized interlayered limestone in two distinct section of the High Atlas CAMP.&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Siberian Traps]] (252.6)&lt;ref&gt;This massive eruptive event spanned the Permian-Triassic boundary, about 250 million years ago, and is cited as a possible cause of the Permian-Triassic extinction event. The Siberian Traps are considered to have erupted via numerous vents over a period of roughly a million years or more. The source of the Siberian Traps basalt has variously been attributed to a mantle plume which impacted the base of the earth's crust and erupted through the Siberian Craton, or to processes related to plate tectonics. Another possible cause may be the impact that formed the [[Wilkes Land crater]], which may have been contemporaneous and would have been antipodal to the Traps. However, there are already other suggested candidates for giant impacts at the Permian–Triassic boundary, for example [[Bedout]] off the northern coast of Western Australia, although all are equally contentious&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Emeishan Traps]] (258)&lt;ref&gt;The eruptions that produced the Emeishan Traps began c. 260 million years ago (Ma). In volume, the Emeishan Traps are dwarfed by the massive Siberian Traps, which occurred, in terms of the geological time scale, not long after, at c. 251 Ma. Nonetheless, the Emeishan Traps eruptions were serious enough to have global ecological and paleontological impact. The Emeishan Traps are associated with the so-called end-Guadalupian Extinction or end-Capitanian mass extinction.&lt;br&gt;http://www.agu.org/wps/rgg/46/46.09/articles/S01SEP05.PDF Emeishan volcanism was active at 258–246 Ma&lt;/ref&gt;

With the 40Ar/39Ar technique, integrated ages range from 344 to 367 Ma, with uncertainties on the order of 1 Ma, and two samples yielded plateaus, i.e. the best determined ages, at 360.3 ± 0.9 and 370.0 ± 0.7 Ma. Three out of four ages yielded by the two separate methods are in agreement within uncertainties. One sample yields incompatible ages and could be from a later, altered dyke event. The 40Ar/39Ar plateau age of 370.0 ± 0.7 Ma (conventional calibration) or 373.4 ± 0.7 Ma (recalculated per Renne et al., 2010), the most reliable age obtained in this study, is compatible with recent determinations of the Late Devonian extinction events at the end-Frasnian (~ 376 ± 3 Ma). These results underscore a need for further work, in progress.&lt;/ref&gt;

It coincided with a global low point in sea level, is closely followed by an excursion in geochemical isotopes in the ensuing late Ludfordian faunal stage and a change in depositional regime. Profound sedimentary changes occurred at the beginning of the Lau event; these are probably associated with the onset of sea level rise, which continued through the event, reaching a high point at the time of deposition of the Burgsvik beds, after the event.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event lasted around 200,000 years, spanning the base of the Wenlock epoch. It comprises eight extinction "datum points"—the first four being regularly spaced, every 30,797 years, and linked to the Milankovic obliquity cycle. The fifth and sixth probably reflect maxima in the precessional cycles, with periods of around 16.5 and 19 ka. Subsequent to the first extinctions, excursions in the δ13C and δ18O records are observed; δ13C rises from +1.4‰ to +4.5‰, while δ18O increases from −5.6‰ to −5.0‰.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="91742">[[File:Indian Mary 2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=A wide placid river flows through the woods.|[[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] (seventh longest) near Indian Mary Park in [[Josephine County, Oregon|Josephine County]]]] Seventy-seven rivers and creeks of at least 50&amp;nbsp;miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) in total length are the longest streams of the U.S. state of [[Oregon]]. All of these streams originate in the United States except the longest, the [[Columbia River|Columbia]], which begins in the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] and flows 1,249&amp;nbsp;miles (2,010&amp;nbsp;km) to the sea near [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]]. The second-longest, the [[Snake River]], which at {{convert|1078|mi|km}} is the only other stream of more than {{convert|1000|mi|km}} on the list, begins in [[Wyoming]] and flows through parts of [[Idaho]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], as well as Oregon. Some of the other streams also cross borders between Oregon and [[California]], [[Nevada]], Idaho, or Washington, but the majority flow entirely within Oregon.

The ''Atlas of Oregon'' ranks 31 rivers in the state by average [[streamflow]]; the top five are the Columbia, Snake, [[Willamette River|Willamette]], [[Santiam River|Santiam]], and [[Umpqua River|Umpqua]].{{sfn|Allan|Buckley|Meacham|2001|pp=162–169}}  Not all Oregon rivers with high average flows are on this list of longest streams because neither their [[main stem]]s nor any of their [[tributary|tributaries]] (including what are called "forks") are at least 50&amp;nbsp;miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) long. High-flow streams mentioned in the ''Atlas'' but not included in this long-stream list are the [[Metolius River|Metolius]], [[Hood River (Oregon)|Hood]], [[Youngs River|Youngs]], and [[Coos River|Coos]] rivers. On the other hand, the list includes four low-flow [[Stream#Intermittent and ephemeral streams|intermittent streams]]—[[Dry River (Crooked River)|Dry River]], [[Rattlesnake Creek (Oregon)|Rattlesnake Creek]], [[Rock Creek (Catlow Valley)|Rock Creek]], and [[Dry Creek (Oregon)|Dry Creek]]—that cross parts of the [[High Desert (Oregon)|Oregon High Desert]].

The direction of Oregon stream flow is influenced by four major drainage divides: the [[Oregon Coast Range]] on the west, the [[Cascade Range]] further inland, the [[Klamath Mountains|Klamath]]–[[Siskiyou Mountains|Siskiyou]] Mountains in the southwest, and the [[Blue Mountains (Oregon)|Blue Mountains]] in the northeast. One set of streams, including the [[Nehalem River]], flows directly into the Pacific Ocean or into larger streams flowing directly to the Pacific; other streams, such as the [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]], flow into the Columbia River or its tributaries. A third set, including the [[Klamath River]] and its tributaries, originates in Oregon, but its waters eventually flow into northern California before reaching the ocean. Other streams like the [[Donner und Blitzen River]] flow into [[closed basin]]s, such as [[Malheur Lake]], that have no outlet to the sea.{{sfn|Allan|Buckley|Meacham|2001|pp=162–169}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13565">This is a list of the most commonly cultivated varieties of [[sweet corn]], and the approximate number of days from [[germination]] of corn plant to [[harvest]].  Unless otherwise noted with the term ''open pollinated,'' all varieties are [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]].

Genetically modified varieties only available to large-scale commercial growers, such as [[Bt corn]] and [[glyphosate]] resistant corn, are not listed.

==Standard (''su'')==
The oldest type of sweet corn, which contains more sugar and less starch than [[field corn]] intended for livestock.  Tends to be heartier in respect to planting depth, germination and growth than other types.  Begins conversion of sugar to starch after peak maturity or harvest, and as such is best when harvested and eaten immediately.

===Yellow su===

* Country Gentleman, 92 days (heirloom, [[Shoepeg corn|shoepeg]] type, open pollinated)
* Silver Queen, 92 days&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt;
* Stowell's Evergreen, 98 days (heirloom, open pollinated.  In northern climates or higher altitudes, this variety may not reach full maturity in the growing season.  However, before the killing frost entire stalks may be harvested, including the partially mature ears, and hung in a barn or shed. Ears may then be picked for a month or more, hence the name ''evergreen.'')

* Butter &amp; Sugar, 75 days
* Sugar Dots, 81 days
* Honey &amp; Cream, 84 days&lt;ref name="crookhamsesu"/&gt;

===Multicolor su===
Multicolored varieties are usually at their sweetest when the mature color just starts to "blush" on the kernels.
* Hookers, 70 days (open pollinated, white turning blue at maturity)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.seedsofchange.com/quickfacts.aspx?c=9510&amp;cat=143 | title = Hookers Sweet Corn | accessdate = 2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Black Mexican/Aztec, 76 days (heirloom, open pollinated, white turning blue-black at maturity)

==Sugary Extender (''se'')==
Contains even more sugars in relation to starch than su types, and as such is able to retain sweetness for 2 to 4 days with proper refrigerated handling.  Somewhat less hardy than su types.  Is known as a "tender" kernel and as such does not lend itself to mechanical handling.  Does not require isolation from su pollen, although it is preferred.  Some seed catalogs don't distinguish the heterozygous se (one se parent) and homozygous se (two se parent) varieties, but if they do, the homozygous se varieties will be labeled either ''se+'', ''(se se)'' or ''SE''.

===Multicolor se===
Multicolored varieties are usually at their sweetest when the mature color just starts to "blush" on the kernels.
* Ruby Queen, 75 days (white turning dark red at maturity)

==Supersweet (''sh2'')==
Supersweet or shrunken-2 types have four to ten times the sugar content of normal sugar (su) types and with proper handling is able to be stored for up to 10 days.&lt;ref name="DLLarson"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Levey Larson|first= Debra |date=August 2003|title= Supersweet sweet corn: 50 years in the making|journal= Inside Illinois|volume= 23|issue= 3|url= http://www.news.uiuc.edu/II/03/0807/sweetcorn.html|accessdate=2009-12-30|publisher= University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Less hardy than even se types, requiring higher germination temperatures, precise planting depth and isolation from all other corn pollen for optimum results.  The name derives from the shrunken, shriveled appearance of the dried kernel which is low in starch.

==Synergistic (''sy'')==
Synergistic varieties combine differing genetics on the same ear.  The first varieties developed of this type have 25% sh2, 25% se and 50% su kernels on the cob but now different combinations are possible.  There is an increasing number of brand names and trademarks that cover specific genetic combinations under this general type.  However, a common trait of all sy types is that isolation from other su and se varieties pollinating at the same time is not required, though isolation may still be recommended for maximum sweetness.

==Augmented Supersweet==
Varieties of the augmented supersweet type combine multiple gene types on top of sh2.  These varieties have 100% of the kernels containing the sh2 gene, but also have se and su genes in some portion of the kernels.  The ''Mirai'' varieties for example have sh2, se and su genes in all kernels.

The augmented supersweet varieties have tender kernels like the se varieties.  Therefore, mechanical picking is not recommended.

As with other supersweets, these varieties must be isolated from su, se and sy types pollinating at the same time to prevent starchy kernels.

Note: The ''Xtra-Tender'' varieties have a series number that indicates the approximate days to harvest, indicated with ''dd'' in the numbers below.  For example, ''Xtra-Tender 282A'' would have maturity of about 82 days.

[[Image:Mare Humboldtianum 4165 h1.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Oblique view from [[Lunar Orbiter 4]]]]
'''Mare Humboldtianum''' ([[Latin]] for "Sea of [[Alexander von Humboldt]]") is a [[lunar mare]] located within the Humboldtianum basin, just to the east of [[Mare Frigoris]]. It is located along the northeastern limb of the [[Moon]], and continues on to the [[Far side (Moon)|far side]]. Due to its location, the visibility of this feature can be affected by [[libration]], and on occasion it can be hidden from view from [[Earth]].

The basin material is of the [[Nectarian]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]], with the mare material being of the [[Upper Imbrian]] epoch. The lighter gray area to the southeast of the dark mare material is a region of hills within the basin. The rim of this basin forms a mountain range that can be seen under oblique lighting conditions.

The selenographic [[coordinate]]s of this mare are 56.8° N, 81.5° E, and it has a diameter of 273&amp;nbsp;km. However the surrounding basin extends for a diameter of over 600&amp;nbsp;km. The walled plain [[Bel'kovich (crater)|Bel'kovich]] spills over the northwestern portion of Mare Humboldtianum, and the flooded crater Bel'kovich A lies across the southwestern rim of Bel'kovich and part of the floor of the mare.

At the center of the Humboldtianum basin is a [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mascon]], or gravitational high.  The mascon was first identified by Doppler tracking of the [[Lunar Prospector]] spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.281.5382.1476 | title = Improved Gravity Field of the Moon from Lunar Prospector | year = 1998 |author1=A.

This feature was named by [[Johann Heinrich Mädler|Johann H. Mädler]] after Alexander von Humboldt, in recognition of his explorations of unknown lands. It is one of only two lunar maria that are named after people, the other being [[Mare Smythii]] (named after British astronomer [[William Henry Smyth]]), and is located along the eastern lunar limb.

==Popular Culture==
* In an episode of the 1967 TV Series [[Captain Scarlet and The Mysterons]], a Mysteron outpost was shown to be located somewhere in the Humboldt Sea.

'''Mare Humorum''' (the "'''Sea of Moisture'''") is a [[lunar mare]]. The [[impact basin]] it is located in is 425 kilometers across.&lt;ref&gt;D. Ben J. Bussey et al., "Humorum Basin Geology from Clementine Data," Lunar and Planetary Science Conference XXVIII (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
It was not sampled by the Apollo program, so a precise age has not been determined. However, geological mapping indicates that it is intermediate in age between the [[mare Imbrium|Imbrium]] and [[Mare Nectaris|Nectaris]] Basins, suggesting an age of about 3.9 billion years. Humorum Basin is filled with a thick layer of mare [[basalt]], believed to exceed 3 kilometers in thickness at the center of the basin.

A [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]] (mascon), or gravitational high, was identified in the center of Mare Humorum from Doppler tracking of the five [[Lunar Orbiter program|Lunar Orbiter]] spacecraft in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.161.3842.680 | title = Mascons: Lunar Mass Concentrations | year = 1968 | author = P.

On the north edge of Mare Humorum is the large [[Impact crater|crater]] [[Gassendi (crater)|Gassendi]], which was considered as a possible landing site for [[Apollo 17]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  To the south are the floor-fractured [[Vitello (crater)|Vitello]] crater, the partially flooded [[Doppelmayer (crater)|Doppelmayer]], and the smaller [[Puiseux (crater)|Puiseux]].  To the east are [[Hippalus (crater)|Hippalus]] crater and [[Promontorium Kelvin]].  To the west are the Rimae Doppelmayer and the Rupes Liebig, which are cliffs near [[Liebig (crater)|Liebig]] itself which is just west of the mare.

==Names==
Like most of the other maria on the Moon, Mare Humorum was named by [[Giovanni Riccioli]], whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the 17th century astronomer [[Pierre Gassendi]] had named it Anticaspia ('opposite to the Caspian', referring to [[Mare Crisium]], which he had named after the [[Caspian Sea]]),&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.33&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Van Langren]] had labelled it the Mare Venetum ("[[Venice|Venetian]] Sea") in his 1645 map.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.41, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Hevelius]] called it Sinus Sirbonis ("Bay of Serbonis", after the lake of [[Serbonis]], now [[Lake Bardawil]], in [[Egypt]]) in his 1647 map.

If one were to stand behind a large adult sitting stationary on a swing and give them a strong push, the adult would temporarily accelerate to a quite low speed, and then swing only a short distance before beginning to swing in the opposite direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24695">In common usage, the '''[[mass]]''' of an object is often referred to as its '''[[weight]]''', though these are in fact different concepts and quantities. In scientific contexts, mass is the amount of "[[matter]]" in an object (though "matter" may be difficult to define), whereas weight is the [[force]] exerted on an object by [[gravitation|gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;de Silva, G.M.S. (2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KbOf_Ap-ijkC&amp;dq=%22International+Prototype+Kilogram%22&amp;q=%22mass+and+weight+are+often+confused%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22mass%20and%20weight%20are%20often%20confused%22&amp;f=false Basic Metrology for ISO 9000 Certification], Butterworth-Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, an object with a mass of 1.0 kilogram will weigh approximately 9.81 newtons on the surface of the [[Earth]] (its mass multiplied by the [[gravity|gravitational field strength]]), since the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] is a unit of force, while the [[kilogram]] is a unit of mass. The object's weight will be less on [[Mars]] (where gravity is weaker), more on [[Saturn]], and negligible in space when far from any significant source of gravity, but it will always have the same mass.

Objects on the surface of the Earth have weight, although sometimes this weight is difficult to measure. An example is a small object floating in water, which does not appear to have weight since it is buoyed by the water; but it is found to have its usual weight when it is added to water in a container which is entirely supported by and weighed on a scale. Thus, the "weightless object" floating in water actually transfers its weight to the bottom of the container (where the pressure increases). Similarly, a balloon has mass but may appear to have no weight or even ''negative'' weight, due to [[buoyancy]] in air. However the weight of the balloon and the gas inside it has merely been transferred to a large area of the Earth's surface, making the weight difficult to measure. The weight of a flying airplane is similarly distributed to the ground, but does not disappear. If the airplane is in level flight, the same weight-force is distributed to the surface of the Earth as when the plane was on the runway, but spread over a larger area.

A better scientific definition of mass is its description as being composed of [[inertia]], which is the resistance of an object being accelerated when acted on by an external force. Gravitational "weight" is the force created when a mass is acted upon by a [[Gravitation|gravitational field]] and the object is not allowed to free-fall, but is supported or retarded by a mechanical force, such as the surface of a planet. Such a force constitutes weight.&lt;ref&gt;National Physical Laboratory: [http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/faqs/what-are-the-differences-between-mass,-weight,-force-and-load-(faq-mass-and-density) What are the differences between mass, weight, force and load? (FAQ - Mass &amp; Density)]&lt;/ref&gt; This force can be added to by any other kind of force.

While the ''weight'' of an object varies in proportion to the strength of the gravitational field, its ''mass'' is constant (ignoring [[Relativity theory|relativistic effects]]) as long as no energy or matter is added to the object.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Mass in special relativity]] for a discussion of mass in this context. An object or particle does not have to be traveling very close to the [[speed of light]], ''c'', for its [[Mass in special relativity|relativistic mass]], ''M'' (or&amp;nbsp;γ&lt;span style="margin-left:-0.15em"&gt;''m''&lt;/span&gt;) to vary measurably from its rest mass ''m''&lt;span style="margin-left:0.15em"&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Per the [[Lorentz transformation]]s and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein’s]] 1905 paper, ''[[Special relativity|The Special Theory of Relativity]]'', relativistic mass is 0.5% greater than ''m''&lt;span style="margin-left:0.15em"&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at only 9.96%&amp;nbsp;''c'', thus affecting measurements performed with a precision of 1%. Whereas 10% of the speed of light is exceedingly fast in most contexts, it is not "close to the speed of light".&lt;/ref&gt; For example, although a satellite in orbit (essentially a free-fall) is "weightless," it still retains its mass and inertia. Accordingly, even in orbit, an astronaut trying to accelerate the satellite in any direction will still be required to exert force, and will need to exert ten times as much force to accelerate a 10{{nbhyph}}ton satellite at the same rate as one with a mass of only 1&amp;nbsp;ton.

==Overview==
[[Image:8ball break.jpg|thumb|300px|Matter's mass strongly influences many familiar kinetic properties.]]
Mass is (among other properties) an ''[[inertia]]l'' property; that is, the tendency of an object to remain at constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside [[force]]. Under [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton's]] {{age|1687|1|1}}-year-old [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] and an important formula that sprang from his work, {{nowrap|''F'' {{=}}&amp;thinsp;''ma'',}} an object with a mass, ''m'', of one [[kilogram]] will [[acceleration|accelerate]], ''a'', at one [[Metre per second squared|meter per second per second]] (about one-tenth the acceleration due to [[Earth's gravity|earth’s gravity]])&lt;ref&gt;In professional [[metrology]] (the  science of measurement), the acceleration of Earth’s gravity is taken as [[standard gravity]] (symbol: ''g''&lt;span style="margin-left:0.15em"&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), which is defined as precisely {{val|fmt=commas|9.80665}}{{nbsp}}[[metre per second squared|meters{{nbsp}}per square second]] (m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The expression {{nowrap|"1 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;"}} means that ''for every second that elapses'', velocity changes an additional 1&amp;nbsp;meter per second. An acceleration of 1{{nbsp}}m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the same rate of change in velocity as 3.6&amp;nbsp;km/h per second (≈2.2&amp;nbsp;mph per second).&lt;/ref&gt; when acted upon by a force, ''F'', of one [[Newton (unit)|newton]].

Inertia is seen when a [[bowling ball]] is pushed horizontally on a level, smooth surface, and continues in horizontal motion. This is quite distinct from its weight, which is the downwards gravitational force of the bowling ball one must counter when holding it off the floor. The weight of the bowling ball on the Moon would be one-sixth of that on the Earth, although its mass remains unchanged. Consequently, whenever the physics of ''recoil kinetics'' (mass, velocity, inertia, [[inelastic collision|inelastic]] and [[elastic collision]]s) dominate and the influence of gravity is a negligible factor, the behavior of objects remains consistent even where gravity is relatively weak. For instance, billiard balls on a billiard table would scatter and recoil with the same speeds and energies after a break shot on the Moon as on Earth; they would, however, drop into the pockets much more slowly.

In the physical sciences, the terms "mass" and "weight" are rigidly defined as separate measures, as they are different physical properties. In everyday use, as all everyday objects have both mass and weight and one is almost exactly proportional to the other, "weight" often serves to describe both properties, its meaning being dependent upon context. For example, in retail commerce, the "net weight" of products actually refers to mass, and is expressed in mass units such as grams or ounces (see also ''[[Pound (mass)#Use in commerce|Pound: Use in commerce]])''. Conversely, the [[Tire code|load index]] rating on automobile tires, which specifies the maximum [[structural load]] for a tire in kilograms, refers to weight; that is, the force due to gravity. Before the late 20th century, the distinction between the two was not strictly applied in technical writing, so that expressions such as "molecular weight" (for [[molecular mass]]) are still seen.

Because mass and weight are separate quantities, they have different units of measure. In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the [[kilogram]] is the basic unit of mass, and the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] is the basic unit of force. The non-SI [[kilogram-force]] is also a unit of force typically used in the measure of weight. Similarly, the [[avoirdupois]] [[Pound (mass)|pound]], used in both the [[Imperial system]] and [[United States customary units|U.S. customary units]], is a unit of mass, and its related unit of force is the [[pound-force]].

==Converting units of mass to equivalent forces on Earth==
[[Image:Southern ocean gravity hg.png|thumb|260px|Gravity anomalies covering the Southern Ocean are shown here in [[false-color]] relief. This image has been normalized to remove variation due to differences in latitude.]]
When an object's weight (its gravitational force) is expressed in "kilograms", this actually refers to the kilogram-force (kgf or kg-f), also known as the ''kilopond'' (kp), which is a non-SI unit of force. All objects on the Earth's surface are subject to a gravitational acceleration of approximately 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] fixed the value of standard gravity at precisely 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; so that disciplines such as [[metrology]] would have a standard value for converting units of defined mass into defined forces and [[pressure]]s. Thus the kilogram-force is defined as precisely 9.80665 newtons. In reality, gravitational acceleration (symbol: ''g'') varies slightly with [[latitude]], [[elevation]] and subsurface density; these variations are typically only a few tenths of a percent. See also ''[[Gravimetry]]''.

Engineers and scientists understand the distinctions between mass, force, and weight. Engineers in disciplines involving [[weight]] [[Structural load|loading]] (force on a structure due to gravity), such as [[structural engineering]], convert the mass of objects like concrete and automobiles (expressed in kilograms) to a force in newtons (by multiplying by some factor around 9.8; 2 significant figures is usually sufficient for such calculations) to derive the load of the object. Material properties like [[elastic modulus]] are measured and published in terms of the newton and [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (a unit of pressure related to the newton).

==Buoyancy and weight==

[[Image:Submerged-and-Displacing.svg|thumb|174px|Regardless of the [[fluid]] in which an object is immersed (gas or liquid), the buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.]]
[[Image:Hot air balloon just above the ground.jpg|thumb|left|255px|A hot air balloon when it has [[neutral buoyancy]] has no weight for the men to support but still retains great inertia due to its mass.]]
Usually, the relationship between mass and weight on Earth is highly proportional; objects that are a hundred times more massive than a one-liter bottle of soda almost always weigh a hundred times more—approximately 1,000 newtons, which is the weight one would expect on Earth from an object with a mass slightly greater than 100 kilograms. Yet, this is not always the case and there are familiar objects that violate this {{nowrap|mass&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;weight}} proportionality.

A common helium-filled toy balloon is something familiar to many. When such a balloon is fully filled with helium, it has [[buoyancy]]—a force that opposes gravity. When a toy balloon becomes partially deflated, it will often become [[neutral buoyancy|neutrally buoyant]] and can float about the house a meter or two off the floor. In such a state, there are moments when the balloon is neither rising nor falling and—in the sense that a scale placed under it will have no force applied to it—is, in a sense perfectly weightless (actually as noted below, weight has merely been redistributed along the Earth's surface so it cannot be measured). Though the rubber comprising the balloon has a mass of only a few grams, which might be almost unnoticeable, the rubber still retains all its mass when inflated.

Again, unlike the effect that low-gravity environments have on weight, buoyancy does not make a portion of an object’s weight vanish; the missing weight is instead being borne by the ground, which leaves less force (weight) being applied to any scale theoretically placed underneath the object in question (though one may perhaps have some trouble with the practical aspects of accurately weighing something individually in that condition). If one were however to weigh a small wading pool that someone then entered and began floating in, they would find that the full weight of the person was being borne by the pool and, ultimately, the scale underneath the pool. Whereas a buoyant object (on a properly working scale for weighing buoyant objects) would weigh less, the ''object&lt;span style="margin-left:0.2em"&gt;/&lt;span style="margin-left:0.2em"&gt;fluid system''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; becomes heavier by the value of object's full mass once the object is added. Since air is a fluid, this principle applies to object&lt;span style="margin-left:0.2em"&gt;/&lt;span style="margin-left:0.2em"&gt;air&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; systems as well; large volumes of air—and ultimately the ground—supports the weight a body loses through mid-air buoyancy.

The effects of buoyancy don’t just affect balloons; both liquids and gases are [[fluid]]s in the physical sciences, and when all macro{{nbhyph}}size objects larger than dust particles are immersed in fluids on Earth, they have some degree of buoyancy.&lt;ref&gt;Objects the size of small dust particles, or smaller, are so strongly influenced by [[Brownian motion]] that they are no longer influenced by buoyancy.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of either a swimmer floating in a pool or a balloon floating in air, buoyancy can fully counter the gravitational weight of the object being weighed, for a weighing device in the pool. However, as noted, an object supported by a fluid is fundamentally no different from an object supported by a sling or cable—the weight has merely been transferred to another location, not made to disappear.

The mass of "weightless" (neutrally buoyant) balloons can be better appreciated with much larger hot air balloons. Although no effort is required to counter their weight when they are hovering over the ground (when they can often be within one hundred newtons of zero weight), the inertia associated with their appreciable mass of several hundred kilograms or more can knock fully grown men off their feet when the balloon’s basket is moving horizontally over the ground.

Buoyancy and the resultant reduction in the downward force of objects being weighed underlies [[Archimedes' principle]], which states that the buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. If this fluid is air, the force may be small.

==Buoyancy effects of air on measurement==
Normally, the effect of air buoyancy on objects of normal [[density]] is too small to be of any consequence in day-to-day activities.  For instance, buoyancy’s diminishing effect upon one’s body weight (a relatively low-density object) is {{frac|860}} that of gravity (for pure water it is about {{frac|770}} that of gravity). Furthermore, ''variations'' in barometric pressure will rarely affect one’s weight more than ±1 part in 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;Assumptions: An air density of 1160&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, an average density of a human body (with collapsed lungs) equal to that of water, and variations in barometric pressure rarely exceeding ±{{convert|22|torr}}. Assumptions primary variables: An altitude of 194 meters above mean sea level (the worldwide median altitude of human habitation), an indoor temperature of 23&amp;nbsp;°C, a dewpoint of 9&amp;nbsp;°C, and {{convert|760|mmHg|abbr=on|kPa}} sea level–corrected barometric pressure.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[metrology]] (the science of measurement), the precision mass standards for calibrating laboratory scales and balances are manufactured with such accuracy that air density is accounted for to compensate for buoyancy effects. Given the extremely high cost of [[platinum]]-[[iridium]] mass standards like the [[Kilogram#International prototype kilogram|International Prototype Kilogram]] (''the'' mass standard in France that defines the magnitude of the kilogram), high-quality "working" standards are made of special [[stainless steel]] alloys&lt;ref&gt;For example, for the recalibration of the US National Prototype Kilogram in 1985, two [[Stainless Steel#Types of stainless steel|austenitic]] stainless steel artifacts were used for comparison. One, named D2, is similar to 18-8 ([[SAE 304 stainless steel|type 304]]) stainless (ie 18% Chromium, 8% Nickel); the other, named CH-1, is a more complex alloy that could be roughly designated as CrNiMo30-25-2 (chemical composition is 29.9% Cr, 25.1% Ni, 2.2% Mo, 1.45% Mn, 0.53 Si, 0.2% Cu, 0.07% C, 0.0019% P).{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=R. N.|year=1985|title=Recalibration of the US National Prototype Kilogram|journal=Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards|volume=90|issue=4|page=267|publisher=[[US Government Printing Office]]|location=Washington|url=http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/090/4/V90-4.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2011|doi=10.6028/jres.090.015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603212929/http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/090/4/V90-4.pdf|archive-date=3 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with densities of about 8,000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which occupy greater volume than those made of platinum-iridium, which have a density of about 21,550&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. For convenience, a standard value of buoyancy relative to stainless steel was developed for metrology work and this results in the term "conventional mass".&lt;ref&gt;''International Recommendation OIML&amp;nbsp;R33'', [[International Organization of Legal Metrology]].&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional mass is defined as follows: "For a mass at 20&amp;nbsp;°C, ‘conventional mass’ is the mass of a reference standard of density 8,000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; which it balances in air with a density of 1.2&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;." The effect is a small one, 150&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]] for stainless steel mass standards, but the appropriate corrections are made during the manufacture of all precision mass standards so they have the true labeled mass.

Whenever a high-precision scale (or balance) in routine laboratory use is calibrated using stainless steel standards, the scale is actually being calibrated to conventional mass; that is, true mass minus 150&amp;nbsp;ppm of buoyancy. Since objects with precisely the same mass but with different densities displace different volumes and therefore have different buoyancies and weights, any object measured on this scale (compared to a stainless steel mass standard) has ''its'' conventional mass measured; that is, its true mass minus an ''unknown'' degree of buoyancy. In high-accuracy work, the volume of the article can be measured to mathematically null the effect of buoyancy.

[[Image:Balance à tabac 1850.JPG|thumb|203px|left|A balance-type weighing scale: Unaffected by the strength of gravity.]]
[[Image:Bathroomscales.jpg|thumb|250px|Load-cell based bathroom scale: Affected by the strength of gravity.]]

When one stands on a [[Weighing scale#Balance|balance-beam]]-type [[Weighing scale|scale]] at a doctor’s office, they are having their mass measured directly. This is because balances ("dual-pan" mass comparators) compare the gravitational force exerted on the person on the platform with that on the sliding counterweights on the beams; gravity is the force-generating mechanism that allows the needle to diverge from the "balanced" (null) point. These balances could be moved from Earth's equator to the poles and give exactly the same measurement, i.e. they would not spuriously indicate that the doctor's patient became 0.3% heavier; they are immune to the gravity-countering centrifugal force due to Earth's rotation about its axis. But if you step onto spring-based or digital [[load cell]]-based scales (single-pan devices), you are having your weight (gravitational force) measured; and variations in the strength of the gravitational field affect the reading. In practice, when such scales are used in commerce or hospitals, they are often calibrated on-site and certified on that basis, so that the mass they measure, expressed in pounds or kilograms, is at the desired level of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;National General Conference on Weights and Measures, ''Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices'', NIST Handbook 44&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

==Use in commerce==
In the United States of America the [[United States Department of Commerce]], the [[Technology Administration]], and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) have defined the use of mass and weight in the exchange of goods under the Uniform Laws and Regulations in the areas of [[metrology|legal metrology]] and engine fuel quality in NIST Handbook 130.

NIST Handbook 130 states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'''V.''' "Mass" and "Weight." [NOTE 1, See page 6]
:The mass of an object is a measure of the object’s inertial property, or the amount of matter it contains. The weight of an object is a measure of the force exerted on the object by gravity, or the force needed to support it. The pull of gravity on the earth gives an object a downward acceleration of about 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In trade and commerce and everyday use, the term "weight" is often used as a synonym for "mass." The "net mass" or "net weight" declared on a label indicates that the package contains a specific amount of commodity exclusive of wrapping materials. The use of the term "mass" is predominant throughout the world, and is becoming increasingly common in the United States. (Added 1993)

:'''W.''' Use of the Terms "Mass" and "Weight." [NOTE 1, See page 6]
:When used in this handbook, the term "weight" means "mass". The term "weight" appears when inch-pound units are cited, or when both inch-pound and SI units are included in a requirement. The terms "mass" or "masses" are used when only SI units are cited in a requirement. The following note appears where the term "weight" is first used in a law or regulation.

:'''NOTE 1:''' When used in this law (or regulation), the term "weight" means "mass." (See paragraph V. and W. in Section I., Introduction, of NIST Handbook 130 for an explanation of these terms.) (Added 1993) 6"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

U.S. federal law, which supersedes this handbook, also defines weight, particularly Net Weight, in terms of the avoirdupois pound or mass pound. From [http://frwebgate6.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=02666786821+1+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve 21CFR101 Part 101.105 – Declaration of net quantity of contents when exempt]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:    (a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear a declaration of the net quantity of contents. This shall be expressed in the terms of weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination of numerical count and weight or measure. The statement shall be in terms of fluid measure if the food is liquid, or in terms of weight if the food is solid, semisolid, or viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid; except that such statement may be in terms of dry measure if the food is a fresh fruit, fresh vegetable, or other dry commodity that is customarily sold by dry measure. If there is a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of declaring the contents of a liquid by weight, or a solid, semisolid, or viscous product by fluid measure, it may be used. Whenever the Commissioner determines that an existing practice of declaring net quantity of contents by weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination in the case of a specific packaged food does not facilitate value comparisons by consumers and offers opportunity for consumer confusion, he will by regulation designate the appropriate term or terms to be used for such commodity.
:    (b)(1) Statements of weight shall be in terms of avoirdupois pound and ounce.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[geologic timescale]], the '''Middle Triassic''' is the second of three [[epoch (geology)|epoch]]s of the [[Triassic]] [[period (geology)|period]] or the middle of three [[series (stratigraphy)|series]] in which the Triassic [[system (stratigraphy)|system]] is divided. It spans the time between {{Period start|Middle-Triassic}} [[annum|Ma]] and {{Period start|Upper-Triassic}} Ma (million years ago). The Middle Triassic is divided into the [[Anisian]] and [[Ladinian]] [[age (geology)|ages]] or [[stage (stratigraphy)|stages]].

Formerly the middle series in the Triassic was also known as [[Muschelkalk]]. This name is now only used for a specific unit of [[rock strata]] with approximately Middle Triassic age, found in western Europe.

During this time there were no flowering plants, but instead there were ferns and mosses.  Small dinosaurs began to appear like ''[[Nyasasaurus]]'' and the ichnogenus ''[[Iranosauripus]]''.

'''Mielikki''' is the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[goddess]] of forests and the hunt. She is referred to in various tales as either the wife or the daughter-in-law of [[Tapio (spirit)|Tapio]], and the mother of [[Nyyrikki]] and [[Tuulikki (spirit)|Tuulikki]]. She is said to have played a central role in the creation of the [[bear]].

In the [[Kalevala]], the Finnish national epic based on [[Karelia]]n folklore, the hero [[Lemminkäinen]] offers her and Tapio prayers, gold and silver so he can catch the [[Hiisi]] elk. In another passage, Mielikki is asked to protect cattle grazing in the forest. In a country where the forest was central to providing food through hunting, gathering and cattle grazing, it was thought very important to stay on her good side. She is also offered prayers by those who hunt small game and those who gather mushrooms and berries.

Mielikki is known as a skillful healer who heals the paws of animals who have escaped traps, helps chicks that have fallen from their nests and treats the wounds of [[Western capercaillie|wood grouse]]s after their mating displays. She knows well the healing herbs and will also help humans if they know well enough to ask her for it. Her name is derived from the old Finnish word ''mielu'' which means luck.

'''''Ocotea foetens''''', commonly called '''til''', '''tilo''', '''stinkwood''',  or '''rain tree of Hierro island''',{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} is a [[species]] of tree in the family [[Lauraceae]]. It is [[evergreen]] and grows up to 40 m tall. It is a common constituent of the [[laurisilva]] [[forest]]s of [[Madeira]] and the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref name=IUCN&gt;World Conservation Monitoring Centre 1998.  [http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/30328/all ''Ocotea foetens''].   [http://www.iucnredlist.org 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. ]  Downloaded on 22 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is in danger of becoming threatened due to [[habitat loss]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

== Description ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
''Ocotea foetens'' is [[endemism|endemic]] to [[Macaronesia]]. Like the other species of the genus ''[[Ocotea]]'', it is rich in essential oils, which give an unpleasant odor to the wood when freshly cut (hence the name ''[[:wikt:foetens|foetens]]'', [[Latin]] for ''smelly, stinky, disgusting, unpleasant''). It is rarely used as an ornamental. It is an [[evergreen]] [[tree]] generally up to {{convert|30|m|yd|abbr=on}} in height, although some specimens may reach {{convert|40|m|yd|abbr=on}}. It commonly grows with multiple trunks branched from the base. The bark is rough and irregular, and dark in colour; the young branches are angular, with smooth bark, sometimes reddish in areas of recent growth. The [[wood]] is dark and hard.

The [[leaf|leaves]] are about {{convert|9|–|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|–|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, [[Leaf shape|oblong-lanceolate]] to almost elliptical, acuminate at the apex and slightly indented at the base. In adult plants, the leaves are leathery in texture, glossy on both sides, darker green on the upper surface, with 2(-4) small gland-like depressions on the underside near the base. The [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]] are short (up to {{convert|15|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length).

The [[flower]]s of both sexes are white, with splashes of green and pale yellow, releasing a slight odor. The [[perianth]] has six components, and there are nine stamens. The predominant flowering season is from June to August (northern hemisphere).

The [[fruit]] is a [[Berry (botany)|berry]], hard and fleshy and about {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, its lower half covered by a dome, giving it a look similar to an [[acorn]]. The fruit is dark green, gradually darkening with maturity. The fruit has a single seed wrapped in a hard coat. When the fruits fall they separate from the dome. Germination is favored by moisture and light.

==Ecology==
''Ocotea foetens'' is endemic to [[Madeira]] and the [[Canary Islands]], appearing in laurel forest habitat, generally between 400 and 1400 m altitude. In the Canary Islands it is not present on [[Lanzarote]] or [[Fuerteventura]]. In the archipelago of Madeira it is absent from [[Porto Santo]]. In [[Azores]] Islands it is an introduced species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azores.gov.pt/NR/rdonlyres/3E255F0D-6AFD-4EF8-974D-CF920B5F933E/126780/42_Pteridophyta_Spermatophyta1.pdf|title=A list of the terrestrial fauna (Mollusca and Arthropoda) and flora (Bryophyta, Pteridophyta and Spermatophyta) from the Azores.|date=|website=|publisher=Direcção Regional do Ambiente e Universidade dos Açores|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only [[Paleoendemic]] ''Ocotea'' species in the wetter relict forest areas of Macaronesia. Its berries are consumed mostly by the endemic Madeiran pigeon ''[[Columba trocaz]]''.

==Folklore==
''Ocotea foetens'' was sacred to the [[Bimbache]]s, the older inhabitants of [[El Hierro]] in the [[Canary Islands]], and was one of their symbols.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}} The legend states that the "Garoé" was a large laurel tree that assured the life of the Bimbaches, providing them with water in sufficient amounts for their survival. The islands are located where tradewinds occur, and water from clouds condensed on the branches of the tree and it later poured rain around the island.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}} One of many legends says that the water originating from the tree was led to a hole from which the Bimbaches could provide water.

The original tree fell in a storm in 1610. In 1957, a replacement was planted in the same location as the Garoé.  It has been growing and is surrounded by [[moss]]es.

'''Patterns in nature''' are visible regularities of form found in the natural world. These [[patterns]] recur in different contexts and can sometimes be [[modelled mathematically]]. Natural patterns include [[symmetries]], [[trees]], [[spirals]], [[meanders]], [[wave]]s, [[foams]], [[tessellations]], [[fracture|cracks]] and stripes.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=3}} Early [[Greek philosophers]] studied pattern, with [[Plato]], [[Pythagoras]] and [[Empedocles]] attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.

In the 19th century, Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] examined [[soap film]]s, leading him to formulate the concept of a [[minimal surface]]. German biologist and artist [[Ernst Haeckel]] painted hundreds of [[Marine biology|marine organisms]] to emphasise their [[symmetry]]. Scottish biologist [[D'Arcy Thompson]] pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations could explain spiral growth. In the 20th century, British mathematician [[Alan Turing]] predicted mechanisms of [[morphogenesis]] which give rise to [[Turing patterns|patterns]] of spots and stripes. Hungarian biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] and French American mathematician [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] showed how the mathematics of [[fractals]] could create plant growth patterns.

[[Mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] can explain patterns in nature at different levels. Patterns in living things are explained by the [[biology|biological]] processes of [[natural selection]] and [[sexual selection]]. Studies of [[pattern formation]] make use of [[computer models]] to simulate a wide range of patterns.

==History==
[[File:Cycas circinalis male cone in Olomouc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fibonacci]] patterns occur widely in plant structures, including this cone of queen sago, ''[[Cycas circinalis]]'']]

Early Greek philosophers attempted to explain order in [[nature]], anticipating modern concepts. [[Plato]] (c. 427 – c. 347 BC) — looking only at his work on natural patterns — argued for the existence of [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]]. He considered these to consist of [[Theory of Forms|ideal forms]] ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}} ''eidos'': "form") of which physical objects are never more than imperfect copies. Thus, a flower may be roughly circular, but it is never a perfect mathematical circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/ | title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher=Stanford University | work=Platonism in Metaphysics | origyear=2004 | date=7 April 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2012 | author=Balaguer, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pythagoras]] explained patterns in nature like the harmonies of music as arising from number, which he took to be the basic constituent of existence.&lt;ref&gt;The so-called Pythagoreans, who were the first to take up mathematics, not only advanced this subject, but saturated with it, they fancied that the principles of mathematics were the principles of all things. [[Aristotle]], ''Metaphysics 1–5 '', cc. 350 BC&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empedocles]] to an extent anticipated [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s evolutionary explanation for the structures of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle reports Empedocles arguing that, "[w]herever, then, everything turned out as it would have if it were happening for a purpose, there the creatures survived, being accidentally compounded in a suitable way; but where this did not happen, the creatures perished." ''The Physics'', B8, 198b29 in Kirk, et al., 304).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1202, [[Fibonacci|Leonardo Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 – c. 1250) introduced the Fibonacci number sequence to the western world with his book ''[[Liber Abaci]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Parmanand. ''Acharya Hemachandra and the (so called) Fibonacci Numbers''. Math. Ed. Siwan, 20(1):28–30, 1986. {{issn|0047-6269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fibonacci gave an (unrealistic) biological example, on the growth in numbers of a theoretical [[rabbit]] population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Knott | first = Ron | title = Fibonacci's Rabbits | url=http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat.html#Rabbits | publisher =[[University of Surrey]] Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1658, the English physician and philosopher [[Sir Thomas Browne]] discussed "how Nature Geometrizeth" in ''[[The Garden of Cyrus]]'', citing [[Pythagorean numerology]] involving the number 5, and the [[Platonic form]] of the [[quincunx]] pattern. The discourse's central chapter features examples and observations of the [[quincunx]] in botany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Browne, Thomas |authorlink=Sir Thomas Browne |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/gardennoframes/garden3.html |title=How Nature Geometrizeth |work=[[The Garden of Cyrus]] |date=1658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] (1860–1948) published his book ''[[On Growth and Form]]''. His description of [[phyllotaxis]] and the [[Fibonacci sequence]], the mathematical relationships in the spiral growth patterns of plants, is classic. He showed that simple equations could describe all the apparently complex spiral growth patterns of [[animal horn]]s and [[mollusc shell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darcythompson.org/about.html About D'Arcy]. D' Arcy 150. [[University of Dundee]] and the [[University of St Andrews]]. Retrieved 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] (1801–1883) formulated the [[Plateau's problem|mathematical problem]] of the existence of a [[minimal surface]] with a given boundary, which is now named after him. He studied soap films intensively, formulating [[Plateau's laws]] which describe the structures formed by films in foams.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=108–109}}

The German psychologist [[Adolf Zeising]] (1810–1876) claimed that the [[golden ratio]] was expressed in the arrangement of plant parts, in the [[skeleton]]s of animals and the branching patterns of their veins and nerves, as well as in the geometry of [[crystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Proportion | author=Padovan, Richard | authorlink=Richard Padovan | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | date=1999 | isbn=978-0-419-22780-9 | pages=305–306 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vk_CQULdAssC&amp;pg=PA306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Nexus Network Journal | first=Richard | last=Padovan | authorlink=Richard Padovan | title=Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture | volume=4 | pages=113–122 | doi=10.1007/s00004-001-0008-7 | date=2002 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Adolf | last=Zeising | title=Neue Lehre van den Proportionen des meschlischen Körpers |date=1854 | page=preface | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919) painted beautiful illustrations of marine organisms, in particular [[Radiolaria]], emphasising their [[symmetry]] to support his faux-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] theories of evolution.{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=41}}

The American photographer [[Wilson Bentley]] (1865–1931) took the first micrograph of a [[snowflake]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography | volume=1 | first=John | last=Hannavy | publisher=CRC Press | date=2007 | isbn=978-0-415-97235-2 | page=149 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=PJ8DHBay4_EC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=wilson+bentley+january+15#v=onepage&amp;q=wilson%20bentley%20january%2015&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drcy.svg|thumb|[[D'Arcy Thompson]] pioneered the study of growth and form in his 1917 book]]
In 1952, [[Alan Turing]] (1912–1954), better known for his work on computing and [[codebreaking]], wrote ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]'', an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref name=Turing&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Turing | first= A. M. | authorlink=Alan Turing | title = The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] | volume = 237 | pages = 37–72 | date = 1952 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | issue= 641| bibcode = 1952RSPTB.237...37T }}&lt;/ref&gt; He predicted [[Chemical clock|oscillating]] [[chemical reaction]]s, in particular the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]]. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns (dubbed "[[Turing pattern]]s") of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=163, 247–250}}

In 1968, the Hungarian theoretical biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] (1925–1989) developed the [[L-system]], a [[formal grammar]] which can be used to model [[plant development|plant growth patterns]] in the style of [[fractal]]s.&lt;ref name=L&gt;[[Rozenberg, Grzegorz]]; Salomaa, Arto. ''The Mathematical Theory of L Systems''. [[Academic Press]], New York, 1980. {{isbn|0-12-597140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; L-systems have an [[alphabet]] of symbols that can be combined using [[Formal grammar|production rules]] to build larger strings of symbols, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. In 1975, after centuries of slow development of the mathematics of patterns by [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Helge von Koch]], [[Wacław Sierpiński]] and others, [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] wrote a famous paper, ''[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension]]'', crystallising mathematical thought into the concept of the [[fractal]].&lt;ref name=Mandelbrot/&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Aphids and live young under Sycamore leaf.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Composite patterns: [[aphids]] and newly born young in arraylike clusters on [[sycamore]] leaf, divided into [[polygon]]s by [[vein (botany)|veins]], which are avoided by the young aphids]]

Living things like [[orchid]]s, [[hummingbird]]s, and the [[Structural coloration|peacock's tail]] have abstract designs with a beauty of form, pattern and colour that artists struggle to match.&lt;ref name=ForbesGuardian&gt;Forbes, Peter. ''All that useless beauty''. The Guardian. Review: Non-fiction. 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The beauty that people perceive in nature has causes at different levels, notably in the mathematics that governs what patterns can physically form, and among living things in the effects of natural selection, that govern how patterns evolve.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=222}}

[[Mathematics]] seeks to discover and explain abstract patterns or regularities of all kinds.&lt;ref name=Steen&gt;[[Lynn Steen|Steen, L.A.]]. ''The Science of Patterns''. [[Science (journal)|Science]], 240: 611–616, 1998. [http://www.ascd.org/publications/curriculum-handbook/409/chapters/The-Future-of-Mathematics-Education.aspx Summary at ascd.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Devlin&gt;[[Keith Devlin|Devlin, Keith]]. ''Mathematics: The Science of Patterns: The Search for Order in Life, Mind and the Universe'' (Scientific American Paperback Library) 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
Visual patterns in nature find explanations in [[chaos theory]], fractals, logarithmic spirals, topology and other mathematical patterns. For example, [[L-system]]s form convincing models of different patterns of tree growth.&lt;ref name=L/&gt;
[[File:Dragon trees.jpg|thumb|The growth patterns of certain trees resemble these [[L-system|Lindenmayer system]] fractals.]]

The laws of [[physics]] apply the abstractions of mathematics to the real world, often as if it were [[perfection#Physics and chemistry|perfect]]. For example, a [[crystal]] is perfect when it has no structural defects such as dislocations and is fully symmetric. Exact mathematical perfection can only approximate real objects.&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz, Władysław]]. ''Perfection in the Sciences. II. Perfection in Physics and Chemistry'', Dialectics and Humanism, vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Visible patterns in nature are governed by [[physical law]]s; for example, [[meander]]s can be explained using [[fluid dynamics]].

In [[biology]], [[natural selection]] can cause the development of patterns in living things for several reasons, including [[camouflage]],&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]]. ''On the Origin of Species''. 1859, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[sexual selection]],&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4/&gt; and different kinds of signalling, including [[mimicry]]&lt;ref name=Wickler&gt;{{cite book |last=Wickler |first=Wolfgang |authorlink=Wolfgang Wickler |date=1968 |title=Mimicry in plants and animals |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cleaning symbiosis]].&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter&gt;Poulin, R.; Grutter, A.S.

''Bioscience'' 46(7): 512–517. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In plants, the shapes, colours, and patterns of [[insect pollination|insect-pollinated]] [[flowers]] like the [[Lilium|lily]] have evolved to attract insects such as [[European honey bee|bees]]. Radial patterns of colours and stripes, some visible only in ultraviolet light serve as [[nectar guides]] that can be seen at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plantphys.info/plants_human/pollenadapt.shtml | title=Plant Physiology Information Website | publisher=Ross Koning | work=Pollination Adaptations | date=1994 | accessdate=May 2, 2012 | author=Koning, Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of pattern ==

=== Symmetry ===

{{further|Symmetry in biology|Floral symmetry|Crystal symmetry}}

[[Symmetry]] is pervasive in living things. Animals mainly have bilateral or [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]], as do the leaves of plants and some flowers such as [[orchid]]s.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=48–49}} Plants often have radial or [[rotational symmetry]], as do many flowers and some groups of animals such as [[sea anemone]]s. Fivefold symmetry is found in the [[echinoderms]], the group that includes [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]].{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=64–65}}

Among non-living things, [[snowflake]]s have striking [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]; each flake's structure forms a record of the varying conditions during its crystallization, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=52}} [[Crystal]]s in general have a variety of symmetries and [[crystal habit]]s; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike [[quasicrystals]]).{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=82–84}} Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things, including the crown-shaped [[Splash (fluid mechanics)|splash]] pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond,{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=60}} and both the [[spheroidal]] shape and rings of a [[planet]] like [[Saturn]].{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=71}}

Symmetry has a variety of causes. Radial symmetry suits organisms like sea anemones whose adults do not move: food and threats may arrive from any direction. But animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The head becomes specialised with a mouth and sense organs ([[cephalisation]]), and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric (though internal organs need not be).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://biocongroup.eu/DA/Calendario_files/Bilateria.pdf | title=Animal Diversity | edition=Third | publisher=McGraw-Hill | work=Chapter 8: Acoelomate Bilateral Animals | date=2002 | accessdate=October 25, 2012 | author=Hickman, Cleveland P. | author2=Roberts, Larry S. | author3=Larson, Allan | pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; More puzzling is the reason for the fivefold (pentaradiate) symmetry of the echinoderms. Early echinoderms were bilaterally symmetrical, as their larvae still are. Sumrall and Wray argue that the loss of the old symmetry had both developmental and ecological causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=4500143 | title=Ontogeny in the fossil record: diversification of body plans and the evolution of "aberrant" symmetry in Paleozoic echinoderms | author=Sumrall, Colin D. | author2=Wray, Gregory A. | journal=Paleobiology |date=January 2007 | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=149–163 |doi=10.1666/06053.1}} &lt;!--http://www.psjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1666/06053.1--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Trees, fractals ===

[[Fractal]]s are infinitely [[self-similarity|self-similar]], iterated mathematical constructs having [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandelbrot, Benoît B. | title=The fractal geometry of nature| date=1983 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Falconer | first = Kenneth | authorlink=Kenneth Falconer (mathematician) | title = Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications | publisher = John Wiley | date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patterns"&gt;{{Cite book | title=Fractals:The Patterns of Chaos | last=Briggs | first=John | authorlink= |date= 1992|publisher= Thames and Hudson |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinite [[iteration]] is not possible in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate. For example, the leaves of [[fern]]s and [[umbellifer]]s (Apiaceae) are only self-similar (pinnate) to 2, 3 or 4 levels. Fern-like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including [[bryozoa]], [[coral]]s, [[hydrozoa]] like the [[air fern]], ''Sertularia argentea'', and in non-living things, notably [[electrical discharge]]s. [[L-system|Lindenmayer system]] fractals can model different patterns of tree growth by varying a small number of parameters including branching angle, distance between nodes or branch points ([[Internode (botany)|internode]] length), and number of branches per branch point.&lt;ref name=L/&gt;

Fractal-like patterns occur widely in nature, in phenomena as diverse as clouds, [[river|river networks]], geologic [[fault line]]s, [[mountain]]s, [[coastline]]s,&lt;ref name=Batty&gt;{{cite journal | journal=New Scientist | date=1985-04-04 | title=Fractals – Geometry Between Dimensions | author=Batty, Michael | page=31 | volume=105 |issue=1450}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[animal coloration]], [[snowflake|snow flakes]],&lt;ref name="snowflake"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aHux78oQbbkC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=snowflake+fractals+book#v=onepage&amp;q=snowflake%20fractals%20book&amp;f=false | page=25 | author=Meyer, Yves | author2=Roques, Sylvie | title=Progress in wavelet analysis and applications: proceedings of the International Conference "Wavelets and Applications," Toulouse, France – June 1992 | date=1993 | publisher=Atlantica Séguier Frontières| isbn=9782863321300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[crystal]]s,&lt;ref name="crystal"&gt;{{cite book| page=78 | author=Carbone, Alessandra | author2=Gromov, Mikhael | author3=Prusinkiewicz, Przemyslaw | title=Pattern formation in biology, vision and dynamics | date=2000|publisher=World Scientific | isbn=9789810237929}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[blood vessel]] branching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Fractal aspects of three-dimensional vascular constructive optimization| author=Hahn, Horst K.| author2=Georg, Manfred| author3=Peitgen, Heinz-Otto | editor=Losa, Gabriele A. | editor2=Nonnenmacher, Theo F.| title=Fractals in biology and medicine | date=2005 | publisher=Springer| pages=55–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[actin cytoskeleton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadegh|first=Sanaz|date=2017|title=Plasma Membrane is Compartmentalized by a Self-Similar Cortical Actin Meshwork|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.011031|journal=Physical Review X|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.7.011031|pmc=5500227|pmid=28690919}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[wind wave|ocean waves]].&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite book | pages=44–46 | title=Fractals and chaos: an illustrated course | author=Addison, Paul S. | date=1997 | publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spirals ===
{{further|phyllotaxis}}

[[Spirals]] are common in plants and in some animals, notably [[molluscs]]. For example, in the [[nautilus]], a cephalopod mollusc, each [[Camera (cephalopod)|chamber]] of its shell is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a [[logarithmic spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;Maor, Eli. ''e: The Story of a Number''. Princeton University Press, 2009. Page 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a modern understanding of fractals, a growth spiral can be seen as a special case of self-similarity.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=29–32}}

Plant spirals can be seen in [[phyllotaxis]], the arrangement of leaves on a stem, and in the arrangement ([[parastichy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/Lattices/SpiralLattices.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526030701/http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/Lattices/SpiralLattices.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=26 May 2010 | title=Spiral Lattices &amp; Parastichy | publisher=Smith College | accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) of other parts as in [[compositae|composite]] [[flower|flower heads]] and [[seed|seed heads]] like the [[sunflower]] or [[fruit]] structures like the [[pineapple]]&lt;ref name=Kappraff&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/1904/19040335.pdf | title=Growth in Plants: A Study in Number | author=Kappraff, Jay | journal=Forma | date=2004 | volume=19 | pages=335–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|337}} and [[salak|snake fruit]], as well as in the pattern of scales in [[pine cones]], where multiple spirals run both clockwise and anticlockwise. These arrangements have explanations at different levels – mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology – each individually correct, but all necessary together.{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=13}} Phyllotaxis spirals can be generated mathematically from [[Fibonacci]] ratios: the Fibonacci sequence runs 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones). For example, when leaves alternate up a stem, one rotation of the spiral touches two leaves, so the pattern or ratio is 1/2. In [[hazel]] the ratio is 1/3; in [[apricot]] it is 2/5; in [[pear]] it is 3/8; in [[almond]] it is 5/13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to geometry|first=H. S. M. |last=Coxeter|author-link =Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|publisher =Wiley|date=1961|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In disc phyllotaxis as in the [[sunflower]] and [[Bellis perennis|daisy]], the florets are arranged in [[Fermat's spiral]] with Fibonacci numbering, at least when the flowerhead is mature so all the elements are the same size. Fibonacci ratios approximate the [[golden angle]], 137.508°, which governs the curvature of Fermat's spiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Prusinkiewicz | first =Przemyslaw | authorlink =Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz |author2=Lindenmayer, Aristid |authorlink2=Aristid Lindenmayer | title =The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants | publisher =Springer-Verlag | date =1990 | pages =101–107 | url =http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#webdocs | isbn = 978-0-387-97297-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phyllotaxis is controlled by [[protein]]s that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone [[auxin]], which activates [[meristem]] growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=163, 249–250}} From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Kappraff/&gt;

=== Chaos, flow, meanders ===

In mathematics, a [[dynamical system]] is chaotic if it is (highly) sensitive to initial conditions (the so-called "[[butterfly effect]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lorenz|first=Edward N. |authorlink=Edward Norton Lorenz |title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |date=March 1963 |volume=20|issue=2 |pages=130–141|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2 | doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2| bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which requires the mathematical properties of [[topological mixing]] and [[dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |date=1999 |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside fractals, [[chaos theory]] ranks as an essentially universal influence on patterns in nature. There is a relationship between chaos and fractals—the ''[[strange attractors]]'' in chaotic systems have a [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruelle, David. ''Chance and Chaos''. Princeton University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[cellular automata]], simple sets of mathematical rules that generate patterns, have chaotic behaviour, notably [[Stephen Wolfram]]'s [[Rule 30]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Stephen. ''[[A New Kind of Science]]''. Wolfram Media, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vortex street]]s are zigzagging patterns of whirling [[Vortex|vortices]] created by the unsteady [[flow separation|separation of flow]] of a [[fluid]], most often air or water, over obstructing objects.&lt;ref&gt;von Kármán, Theodore. ''Aerodynamics''. McGraw-Hill (1963): {{isbn|978-0070676022}}. Dover (1994): {{isbn|978-0486434858}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smooth ([[Laminar flow|laminar]]) flow starts to break up when the size of the obstruction or the velocity of the flow become large enough compared to the [[viscosity]] of the fluid.

[[Meander]]s are sinuous bends in rivers or other channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As soon as the path is slightly curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as [[helical flow]] drags material like sand and gravel across the river to the inside of the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so [[erosion]] accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful [[positive feedback loop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jacques | last=Lewalle | title=Lecture Notes in Incompressible Fluid Dynamics: Phenomenology, Concepts and Analytical Tools | chapter=Flow Separation and Secondary Flow: Section 9.1 | url=http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | date=2006 | location=Syracuse, NY | publisher=Syracuse University | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929075022/http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-29 | df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waves, dunes ===

[[Wave]]s are disturbances that carry energy as they move. [[Mechanical wave]]s propagate through a medium – air or water, making it [[Oscillation|oscillate]] as they pass by.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P. ''Vibrations and Waves''. Nelson Thornes, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind wave]]s are sea [[surface wave]]s that create the characteristic chaotic pattern of any large body of water, though their statistical behaviour can be predicted with wind wave models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=H.L. | last=Tolman | contribution=Practical wind wave modeling | title=CBMS Conference Proceedings on Water Waves: Theory and Experiment | date=2008 | location=Howard University, USA, 13–18 May 2008 | publisher=World Scientific Publ. | url=http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn270/Howard_08.pdf | editor-first=M.F. | editor-last=Mahmood}}&lt;/ref&gt; As waves in water or wind pass over sand, they create patterns of ripples. When winds blow over large bodies of sand, they create [[dune]]s, sometimes in extensive dune fields as in the [[Taklamakan]] desert. Dunes may form a range of patterns including crescents, very long straight lines, stars, domes, parabolas, and longitudinal or seif ('sword') shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/ | title=Types of Dunes | publisher=USGS | date=29 October 1997 | accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barchan]]s or crescent dunes are produced by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the [[slip face]] point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the [[angle of repose]] of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the angle of repose, the sand [[avalanche]]s, which is a [[nonlinear]] behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then the addition of a further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;Strahler, A. &amp; Archibold, O.W. ''Physical Geography: Science and Systems of the Human Environment''. John Wiley, 4th edition 2008. Page 442.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like [[soliton|solitary waves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Schwämmle, V. | author2=Herrman, H.J. | title=Solitary wave behaviour of sand dunes| journal=Nature | volume=426 | issue=Dec. 11 | date=2003 | pages=619–620 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/426619a Abstract] | doi=10.1038/426619a | pmid=14668849|bibcode = 2003Natur.426..619S }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bubbles, foam===

A [[soap bubble]] forms a [[sphere]], a [[minimal surface|surface with minimal area]] — the smallest possible surface area for the volume enclosed. Two bubbles together form a more complex shape: the outer surfaces of both bubbles are spherical; these surfaces are joined by a third spherical surface as the smaller bubble bulges slightly into the larger one.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=108–109}}

A [[foam]] is a mass of bubbles; foams of different materials occur in nature. Foams composed of [[soap film]]s obey [[Plateau's laws]], which require three soap films to meet at each edge at 120° and four soap edges to meet at each vertex at the [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] angle of about 109.5°. Plateau's laws further require films to be smooth and continuous, and to have a constant [[mean curvature|average curvature]] at every point. For example, a film may remain nearly flat on average by being curved up in one direction (say, left to right) while being curved downwards in another direction (say, front to back).{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=68}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] and [[Jean E. Taylor]], ''The geometry of soap films and soap bubbles'', Scientific American, vol. 235, pp. 82–93, July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents. [[Lord Kelvin]] identified the problem of the most efficient way to pack cells of equal volume as a foam in 1887; his solution uses just one solid, the [[bitruncated cubic honeycomb]] with very slightly curved faces to meet Plateau's laws. No better solution was found until 1993 when Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]]; the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]] adapted the structure for their outer wall in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=73–76}}

At the scale of living [[cell (biology)|cells]], foam patterns are common; [[radiolarian]]s, [[sponge]] [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s, [[silicoflagellate]] [[exoskeleton]]s and the calcite skeleton of a [[sea urchin]], ''[[Cidaris rugosa]]'', all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=96–101}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/indexmag.html?http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artfeb05/cbdiatoms.html | title=Geometry and Pattern in Nature 3: The holes in radiolarian and diatom tests | publisher=Microscopy-UK | date=February 2005 | accessdate=May 28, 2012 | author=Brodie, Christina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skeleton of the [[Radiolarian]], ''Aulonia hexagona'', a beautiful marine form drawn by [[Ernst Haeckel]], looks as if it is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The [[Euler characteristic]] states that for any [[convex polyhedron]], the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a [[Euler characteristic#Soccer ball|soccer ball]], [[Buckminster Fuller]] [[geodesic dome]], or [[fullerene]] molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=51–54}}

=== Tessellations ===
{{main|tessellation}}

[[Tessellation]]s are patterns formed by repeating [[tile]]s all over a flat surface. There are 17 [[wallpaper group]]s of tilings.&lt;ref name=armstrong&gt;{{cite book | last=Armstrong | first=M.A. | title=Groups and Symmetry | date=1988 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; While common in art and design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social [[wasp]]s, and the wax cells in [[honeycomb]] built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the [[pangolin]], or fruits like the [[salak]] are protected by overlapping scales or [[osteoderms]], these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, ''[[Fritillaria meleagris]]'', have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of [[minerals]] provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite the hundreds of thousands of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a [[crystal]], defined by [[crystal structure]], [[crystal system]], and [[point group]]; for example, there are exactly 14 [[Bravais lattices]] for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"&gt;Hook, J.R.; Hall, H.E.

=== Cracks ===

[[Fracture|Cracks]] are linear openings that form in materials to relieve [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]. When an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks meet at a node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress in the same direction would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=207}} In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=208}}

===Spots, stripes===

Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; angelfish and zebras are striped.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}} These patterns have an [[evolution]]ary explanation: they have [[Function (biology)|functions]] which increase the chances that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is [[camouflage]];&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4/&gt; for instance, a [[leopard]] that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is [[Signalling theory|signalling]]&lt;ref name=Wickler/&gt; — for instance, a [[ladybird]] is less likely to be attacked by [[predator]]y birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also [[Aposematism|distastefully bitter or poisonous]], or [[Mimicry|mimics]] other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting [[gene]]s that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}}

===Pattern formation===
{{main|Pattern formation}}

Alan Turing,&lt;ref name=Turing/&gt; and later the mathematical biologist [[James D. Murray|James Murray]],&lt;ref name="Murray2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=James D.|title=Mathematical Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3LmCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA436|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-662-08539-4|pages=436–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a [[reaction-diffusion]] system.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}} The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a [[morphogen]], resulting in the growth of a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be [[feedback]] control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create [[standing wave]] patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]] is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a [[chemical oscillator]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}}

Later research has managed to create convincing models of patterns as diverse as zebra stripes, giraffe blotches, jaguar spots (medium-dark patches surrounded by dark broken rings) and ladybird shell patterns (different geometrical layouts of spots and stripes, see illustrations).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=168–180}} [[Richard Prum]]'s activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six variables to account for the observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots and an array of dots.{{sfn|Rothenberg|2011|pages=93–95}}&lt;ref name=Prum/&gt;{{rp|6}} More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl ''[[Numida meleagris]]'' in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end.

Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects the rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it.&lt;ref name=TigerBush/&gt; Fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn more likely to be damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind.

In permafrost soils with an active upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, [[patterned ground]] can form, creating circles, nets, [[ice wedge]] polygons, steps, and stripes. [[Thermal contraction]] causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks into wedges. These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Permafrost: Patterned Ground |url=http://permafrosttunnel.crrel.usace.army.mil/permafrost/patterned_ground.html |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gyrification|fissured pattern]] that develops on vertebrate brains are caused by a physical process of constrained expansion dependent on two geometric parameters: relative tangential cortical expansion and relative thickness of the [[cerebellar cortex|cortex]]. Similar patterns of [[Gyrus|gyri]] (peaks) and [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] (troughs) have been demonstrated in models of the brain starting from smooth, layered gels, with the patterns caused by compressive mechanical forces resulting from the expansion of the outer layer (representing the cortex) after the addition of a solvent. Numerical models in computer simulations support natural and experimental observations that the surface folding patterns increase in larger brains.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-brain-s-bizarre-folding-pattern-re-created-in-a-vat/|last1=Ghose|first1=Tia|title=Human Brain's Bizarre Folding Pattern Re-Created in a Vat|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tallinen|first1=Tuoma|last2=Chung|first2=Jun Young|last3=Biggins|first3= John S.|last4=Mahadevan|first4=L.|title=Gyrification from constrained cortical expansion|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111|issue=35|pages=12667–12672|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''physiological density''' or '''real population density''' is the [[Population|number of people]] per unit area of [[arable land]].

A higher physiological density suggests that the available agricultural [[land]] is being used by more and may reach its output limit sooner than a country that has a lower physiological density.  [[Egypt#Demographics|Egypt]] is a notable example, with physiological density reaching that of Bangladesh, despite much desert.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5587">'''''Red Data Book of the Russian Federation''''' ('''''RDBRF'''''), also known as '''''Red Book''''' ({{lang-ru|Красная книга}}) or '''''Russian Red Data Book''''' is a state document established for documenting rare and [[endangered species]] of [[animal]]s, [[plants]] and [[fungi]], as well as some local [[subspecies]] (such as the [[Ladoga seal]]) that exist within the territory of the [[Russian Federation]] and [[Continental shelf of Russia|its continental shelf]] and [[Exclusive Economic Zone|marine economic zone]]. The book has been adopted by [[Russia]] and all [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] states to enact a common agreement on rare and endangered species protection.

== Conservation ==
The book provides a central information source in organizing studies and monitoring programs on rare and endangered species and their habitats.

==History==
The first Russian ''Red Data Book'' was based upon research conducted between 1961 and 1964 by a number of Soviet biologists. It represented the Soviet part of the [[IUCN Red List]] (hence the name). At that time it was just the [[Soviet Union]]'s first organized list of endangered species, not a legislative document.

In the late sixties, more thorough research was conducted by request of the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1974, based upon ecological evaluation, a decision was made to introduce legislation that would provide for the protection of endangered species. This resulted in the publication of the first official ''Red Book'' in 1978 – a document that complemented law as a list of endangered species. Animals on the list were strictly protected and their treatment regulated by Soviet law. Since that time, constant revisions have been made.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, regulations on endangered species were instituted by each of the former Soviet countries. However, many of them had insufficient expertise and resources to maintain their lists and enforce common regulations; therefore, a common ecological treaty was made with mutual recognition of endangered species.

== Cross-referencing ==
Animals, plants and fungi listed in the [[IUCN-The World Conservation Union]] list of endangered species and inhabiting Russian territory, including the [[continental shelf]] and marine economic zone (whether permanently or temporarily) may be included to the ''RDBRF'' if this is necessary due to their number or status in [[Russia]]. The same is true for species protected by international conventions.

== Legal matters ==
State legal recognition of the ''RDBRF'' is provided by the Russian Federation law '''"About protection of natural environment"''' (December 19, 1991), and by the Russian Federation law '''"About animal world"''' (May 5, 1995). The species listed in the ''sex'' must be listed in the regional red data books of the Russian Federation subjects.

At the moment,{{When|date=February 2011}} the Russian Federation uses the 1998 edition of the ''RDBRF''. A federal Red Data Book is complemented and expanded by regional Red Data Books that govern hunting within particular [[Federal subjects of Russia|region]], although instituting of regional Red Data Books is not compulsory. Regional CIS Red Data Books are direct descendants of their counterparts in the former USSR which were established in individual [[Republics of the Soviet Union|SSR]]s and in certain special areas. Even municipal-level territories at times issue their own Red Data Books.

Usually, a ''Red Book'' comes with a short description of protected species. However, in certain cases, it doesn't give all descriptions due to space limitations and in rare cases there is no formatted list in the book.

All of the CIS states currently implement Red Data Books.

==Criticism of regional policies==
Introduction of regional Red Books sometimes provokes negative reaction, up to "''Red book [[Bacchanalia]]''". It is alleged that funds which could have been used on more proactive ecological activities are being squandered on useless paperwork, since the federal ''RDBRF'' already fulfills all the requirements of such documents. In addition, allegations are made that local illegal animal traffickers use regional Red Books to track down endangered species.

Proponents of Red Books usually give the following reasons: the connection between illegal hunting and Red Books is unclear and not proven. Local biologists can be approached and bribed by illegal entrepreneurs with the same ease. Funds that are used to create these books do support local biological research. Additionally, regional Red Books allow for more accurate and diverse local environmental protection, like greater bird protection in cities and flora protection in Arctic regions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3803">A '''regenerative shock absorber''' is a type of [[shock absorber]] that converts parasitic intermittent [[linear motion]] and [[vibration]] into useful [[energy]], such as [[electricity]].  Conventional shock absorbers simply dissipate this energy as [[heat]].

When used in an [[electric vehicle]] or [[hybrid electric vehicle]] the electricity generated by the shock absorber can be diverted to its powertrain to increase battery life. In non-electric vehicles the electricity can be used to power accessories such as [[air conditioning]].  Several different systems have been developed recently, though they are still in stages of development and not installed on production vehicles.

==Electromagnetic==
A patent for such a device was filed in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{USPTO_Patent|title=Electromagnetic linear generator and shock absorber|patnum=6,952,060}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of system uses a [[linear motor]]/generator consisting of a stack of [[permanent magnet]]s and coils to generate electricity.  This system was further developed at [[Tufts University]] and has been licensed to Electric Truck, LLC. Preliminary data suggests 20% to 70% of the energy normally lost in the suspension can be recaptured with this system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/11/electric-truck.html |title=Electric Truck Exclusively Options Regenerative Magnetic Shock Absorber Technology from Tufts|date=23 November 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-31 |publisher=Green Car Congress}}; Maravandi and Moallem, "Regenerative Shock Absorber Using a Two-Leg Motion Conversion Mechanism," IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics, 2015;{{pageneeded|date=January 2018}} Roshan, Y.M.; Maravandi, A.; Moallem, M. "Power Electronics Control of an Energy Regenerative Mechatronic Damper",  Industrial Electronics, IEEE Transactions on, On page(s): 3052 - 3060 Volume: 62, Issue: 5, May 2015.{{pageneeded|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A system developed at [[Swinburne University of Technology]] used DC electromagnetic machines as damping elements to generate energy for storage in conventional batteries. This system utilized a device based on similar principals to a 'step-up' [[Boost converter|(boost) DC-DC converter]]. The design offered the ability to optimize the energy conversion efficiency of the system and also allow the ability to control the damping coefficient of the damper, such that the system could act as a semi-active damper.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, K.E., Electromagnetic Energy Regenerative Vibration Damping, PhD Thesis, Swinburne University of Technology (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Electromagnetic regenerative damping in vehicle suspension systems|journal=International Journal of Vehicle Design|volume=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydraulic==
A system developed at [[MIT]] uses [[hydraulic]] pistons to force fluid through a [[turbine]] coupled to a [[Electrical generator|generator]].  The system is controlled by active electronics which optimize damping, which the inventors claim also results in a smoother ride compared to a conventional suspension.  They calculate that a large company like [[Walmart]] could save $13 million annually by converting their trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/shock-absorbers-0209.html |title=More power from bumps in the road |last=Chandler |first=David |authorlink= |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-31 |work=MIT News |publisher=MIT News Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another system has been developed by a team at [[New York State University]].

'''Rubanisation''' is a re-conceptualisation of human settlements in which the city and the countryside are considered as one space, not two as it is now - city and countryside are regarded as separate realms. Rubanisation stems from the belief that the continued consideration of the rural and the urban as two distinct realms is unsustainable in terms of [[social justice]], cultural justice and [[environmental justice]]. This mode of thinking calls for a new spatial geometry of integrated development that offers real viable choices for living, one that is supported by environmentally sustainable technology and ethical lifestyle.

== Viable choice ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Urbanism has been blind to the plight of the countryside for too long, and the tide is turning as we face the global financial crisis and climate change. And so the dominance of urbanism as an ideology must give way to a new economy of distributed happiness for all, to be found through social justice and a change in culture, in which an appreciation of community and knowledge for their own sakes and love of nature are prime."&lt;ref&gt;Tay, Kheng Soon. What is 'good' design: thinking about Asian architecture. Singapore Architect, No.246, 2008, pp. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Rubanisation, a reverse migration back to the village is encouraged and made possible through the availability of viable choice, prior to returning to repair the city devastated by unjust accumulation. Focusing on the problems of existing mega-cities is only a stop-gap solution. The argument is that in the present mode of development, the countryside has been largely neglected as cities become 'the exclusive focus of development,'&lt;ref&gt;Tay, Kheng Soon. [http://globalasia.org/pdf/issue7/v3n3_Soon.pdf Behold the countryside: the urban/rural divide.] Global Asia, Vol. 3, No. 3, Fall 2008, pp. 48-55.&lt;/ref&gt; compelling those in the rural areas to migrate to the city in search of better opportunities. This has resulted in a massive population explosion in most cities in the developing world, which manifests itself in the growing presence of slums.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, William S. W. [http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1759:architecture-and-urbanism&amp;catid=219:contributors&amp;Itemid=171 Social and spatial justice for slum and city dwellers.] 23 Oct 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of developed societies, small towns and villages have been losing population to the lure of the big cities for the excitement that they offer. Rubanisation postulates that unless the problem of rural poverty, which 'still remains the main cause for mass rural-urban migration,'&lt;ref&gt;Lim, William S. W. [http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1759:architecture-and-urbanism&amp;catid=219:contributors&amp;Itemid=171 Social and spatial justice for slum and city dwellers.]&lt;/ref&gt; is solved, and people given a real choice in deciding between rural and urban living, the problems of [[urbanisation]] remain intractable.

== Spatial geometry ==
Ruban settlements can be conceived as 'infrastructurally autonomous cells existing within a web of nature, farms, transport, communication and informational interconnectivity.'&lt;ref&gt;Tay, Kheng Soon. 'Rubanisation': The re-conceptualisation of human settlements in harmony with the environment. 12 Nov 2008. [http://www.rubanisation.org/2008/11/rubanisation-re-conceptualisation-of.html http://www.rubanisation.org/2008/11/rubanisation-re-conceptualisation-of.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these cells should not have a radius larger than 500 metres - taken to be the optimal walking distance - with its density and use-mix determined by its location, environment and economic requirements. (The minimum density for a cell, however, is based on the size needed to support the local school population, which is the priority.) Energy-wise each cell is encouraged to be as autonomous as possible, by generating its own power, collecting and processing its own water supply and treating its own organic and inorganic waste.&lt;ref&gt;Tay, Kheng Soon. 'Rubanisation': The re-conceptualisation of human settlements in harmony with the environment.&lt;/ref&gt; Socially every cell is provided with its own schools, health facilities, shops, workplaces, and basic services, all of which fall within walking distance. In this way Rubanisation ensures that every person or family is able to enjoy a high quality of life, with a choice of lifestyle, livelihood and location. Not everybody wants to live in the city, or necessarily in the countryside. At every stage of life, there should be viable choice; a no-choice situation is a crime against humanity.

These autonomous cells are then scattered in the landscape, accommodating geographical and environmental specificities. The boundaries of the cells are more or less circular to allow for the spaces between them to be farms, and this spacing would vary according to settlement densities and open land requirements. In every case, however, provisions are made for green spaces, farms, water bodies, etc. between the cells even when they are closely packed in dense urbanised settings, to allow fresh farm produce to be locally available. While specific modifications and adaptations will be made according to density requirements, 'the cellular nature of the settlement pattern remains the primary system of spatial organisation ensuring both efficiency and liveability,' and 'the old contestation between green and brown sites in urban planning dictated by economic imperatives is thus finally eliminated by this geometry.'&lt;ref&gt;Tay, Kheng Soon. 'Rubanisation': The re-conceptualisation of human settlements in harmony with the environment.&lt;/ref&gt; Human settlements would then be interspersed between an interconnected green web of farms and natural areas throughout the world.

== Existing cities ==
Rubanisation does not seek to eliminate the need for cities. Rather, it merely presents people with a viable alternative to the city as it presently is. Existing cities should be retained for five overarching functions:&lt;ref&gt;Tay, Kheng soon. Presentation given at the Department of Architecture, National University of Singapore. 2 Sep 2009. [http://www.rubanisation.org/2009/09/blog-post.html http://www.rubanisation.org/2009/09/blog-post.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
# the highest level of medical research and treatment
# the highest level of academic research and teaching
# the highest level of finance and administration
# the highest level of entertainment and the arts
# the highest level of manufacturing

Modifications to existing cities can and will occur over time as the concept of distributed Rubanised settlements develops. Through the selective insertion of green spaces and water bodies into the existing dense urban fabric, over time, the green web will be established throughout.

== Transport ==
New transport systems utilising robotic electric buses serve as the transport backbone, to be supplemented by small private electric vehicles belonging to the family or the individual. To maximise road space efficiency, all robotic vehicles are linked together magnetically to form a train whereby each vehicle is able to connect to or disconnect from the train automatically. This provides the sort of flexibility required that fixed rail systems do not. Roads are divided into four categories depending on their width, the traffic density and types of vehicles they are meant to take, in order to eliminate road congestion. This system builds upon the existing roadway systems.

== A new eco-regional economy ==
Presently, economic patterns of production and consumption are environmentally destructive, and so new non-material satisfactions have to be found in life to wean people off the present satisfactions based on material consumption. In a Ruban setting, these new satisfactions take the form of better education, a high quality of environment and improved family and community life. The individualistic and materialistic values perpetrated by the current developmental model ought to incorporate traditional values of compassion, humility, care for others and the environment, as the basis for a new eco-regional economy.

== Work, live, learn, play, farm ==
The impact of Rubanisation goes beyond poverty eradication, by bringing greater balance to working, living, learning, playing and farming within walkable distances. 'Children walk to school. Parents work nearby. Children know what their parents do. Parents are involved in their children's learning situations. Communities interact to imagine new ways to make life better and more secure. Everyone enjoys good clean organic food, know the farmers by name, know how the food is grown and adjust their diet according to seasonable crops.'&lt;ref&gt;Tay, Kheng Soon. The ruban vision. 6 May 2009. [http://www.rubanisation.org/2009/05/ruban-vision.html http://www.rubanisation.org/2009/05/ruban-vision.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The good life will be restored through real creative community action, fulfilling work, and stronger family ties.

== The architecture ==
In the Rubanisation model, local initiative and incremental action are encouraged. Therefore, totalistic designs are abhorrent. Within the overall Ruban pattern which governs the infrastructure and land-use planning, the implementation of building projects are governed by local environmental concerns and individual creativity within the shared values of the settlement. Local materials and techniques should characterise the design style. This would tend towards a natural localism, avoiding the tendency to copy the industrial aesthetics of the 'defunct age.'&lt;ref&gt;Tay, Kheng Soon. The ruban vision.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31928">{{short description|storage of heat or cold for periods of up to several months}}
'''Seasonal thermal energy storage''' (or '''STES''') is the storage of heat or cold for periods of up to several months. The thermal energy can be collected whenever it is available and be used whenever needed, such as in the opposing season. For example, heat from solar collectors or [[waste heat]] from air conditioning equipment can be gathered in hot months for space heating use when needed, including during winter months. Waste heat from industrial process can similarly be stored and be used much later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Andersson | first1 = O. | last2 = Hägg | first2 = M. | contribution = Deliverable 10 - Sweden - Preliminary design of a seasonal heat storage for ITT Flygt, Emmaboda, Sweden | title = Deliverable 10 - Sweden - Preliminary design of a seasonal heat storage for ITT Flygt, Emmaboda, Sweden | series = IGEIA – Integration of geothermal energy into industrial applications | contribution-url = http://www.saunier-associes.com/igeia/docs/documents/projectPublications/D10-FeasabilityStudies.pdf | pages = 38–56 and 72–76 | accessdate = 21 April 2013 | date = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Or the natural cold of winter air can be stored for summertime air conditioning.&lt;ref name="RSC"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Paksoy | first1 = H. | last2 = Snijders | first2 = A. | last3 = Stiles | first3 = L. | contribution = Aquifer Thermal Energy Cold Storage System at Richard Stockton College | title = Aquifer Thermal Energy Cold Storage System at Richard Stockton College | series = EFFSTOCK 2009 (11th International) - Thermal Energy Storage for Efficiency and Sustainability | place = Stockholm | contribution-url = http://underground-energy.com/Aquifer_Thermal_Energy_Cold_Storage_System_at_Richard_Stockton_College.pdf | date = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Gehlin | first1 = S. | last2 = Nordell | first2 = B. | contribution = Thermal Response test-In situ measurements of Thermal Properties in hard rock | title = Thermal Response test-In situ measurements of Thermal Properties in hard rock | series = Avdelningen för vattenteknik.

STES stores can serve district heating systems, as well as single buildings or complexes. Among seasonal storages used for heating, the design peak annual temperatures generally are in the range of {{convert|27|to|80|°C|°F|sigfig=2}}, and the temperature difference occurring in the storage over the course of a year can be several tens of degrees. Some systems use a heat pump to help charge and discharge the storage during part or all of the cycle. For cooling applications, often only circulation pumps are used. A less common term for STES technologies is interseasonal thermal energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wong |first1=Bill |last2=Snijders |first2=Aart |last3=McClung |first3=Larry |title=Recent Inter-seasonal Underground Thermal Energy Storage Applications in Canada |journal=EIC Climate Change Technology, 2006 IEEE |doi=10.1109/EICCCC.2006.277232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples for [[district heating]] include [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] where ground storage provides 97% of yearly consumption without [[heat pump]]s,&lt;ref name=drake1&gt;{{Citation| last = Wong| first = Bill| contribution = Drake Landing Solar Community| title = Drake Landing Solar Community| series = IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto| pages = 1–30| date = June 28, 2011| contribution-url = http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf| accessdate = 21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Danish pond storage with boosting.&lt;ref name=ing2015-06-14/&gt;

==STES technologies==

There are several types of STES technology, covering a range of applications from single small buildings to community district heating networks. Generally, efficiency increases and the specific construction cost decreases with size.

===Underground thermal energy storage===
{{see also|Ground-coupled heat exchanger}}
* '''UTES''' (underground thermal energy storage), in which the storage medium may be geological strata ranging from earth or sand to solid bedrock, or aquifers. UTES technologies include:
** '''ATES''' ([[aquifer thermal energy storage]]). An ATES store is composed of a doublet, totaling two or more wells into a deep aquifer that is contained between impermeable geological layers above and below. One half of the doublet is for water extraction and the other half for reinjection, so the aquifer is kept in hydrological balance, with no net extraction. The heat (or cold) storage medium is the water and the substrate it occupies. Germany’s [[Reichstag building]] has been both heated and cooled since 1999 with ATES stores, in two aquifers at different depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Seibt | first1 = P. | last2 = Kabus | first2 = F.| contribution = Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage in Germany | title = Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage in Germany | series = American Astronomical... | contribution-url = http://www.os.is/gogn/flytja/JHS-Skjol/UNU%20Visiting%20Lecturers/PSLecture03.pdf | date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the Netherlands there are well over 1,000 ATES systems, which are now a standard construction option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Snijders | first1 = A. | contribution = ATES Technology Development and Major Applications in Europe | title = ATES Technology Development and Major Applications in Europe | series = Conservation for the Living Community (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority) | place = Toronto, Canada | date = 30 July 2008| contribution-url = http://trca.on.ca/dotAsset/16551.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Godschalk | first1 = M.S. | last2 = Bakema | first2 = G. | contribution = 20,000 ATES systems in the Netherlands in 2020 - Major step towards a sustainable energy supply | title = 20,000 ATES systems in the Netherlands in 2020 - Major step towards a sustainable energy supply | series = EFFSTOCK 2009 (11th International) - Thermal Energy Storage for Efficiency and Sustainability | place = Stockholm | contribution-url = http://intraweb.stockton.edu/eyos/energy_studies/content/docs/effstock09/Session_10_3_Overviews/94.pdf | date = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A significant system has been operating at Richard Stockton College (New Jersey) for several years.&lt;ref name = "RSC"/&gt; ATES has a lower installation cost than BTES because usually fewer holes are drilled, but ATES has a higher operating cost. Also, ATES requires particular underground conditions to be feasible, including the presence of an aquifer.
** {{anchor|BTES|borehole thermal energy storage}}'''BTES''' (borehole thermal energy storage). BTES stores can be constructed wherever [[borehole]]s can be drilled, and are composed of one to hundreds of vertical boreholes, typically {{convert|155|mm|in|3|abbr=on}} in diameter. Systems of all sizes have been built, including many quite large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Midttømme | first1 = K. | last2 = Ramstad | first2 = R. | contribution = Status of UTES in Norway | title = Status of UTES in Norway | series = EcoStock 2006 (10th International) - Thermal Energy Storage for Efficiency and Sustainability | place = Pomona, New Jersey | contribution-url = http://intraweb.stockton.edu/eyos/energy_studies/content/docs/FINAL_PRESENTATIONS/3A-4.pdf | date = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Stene | first1 = J. | contribution = Large-Scale Ground-Source Heat Pump Systems in Norway | title = Large-Scale Ground-Source Heat Pump Systems in Norway | series = IEA Heat Pump Annex 29 Workshop | place = Zurich | date = 19 May 2008 | contribution-url = http://www.annex29.net/extern/09_STENE_Zuerich_Annex29_GSHPs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Hellström | first1 = G. | contribution = Large-Scale Applications of Ground-Source Heat Pumps in Sweden | title = Large-Scale Applications of Ground-Source Heat Pumps in Sweden | series = IEA Heat Pump Annex 29 Workshop | place = Zurich | date = 19 May 2008 | contribution-url = http://www.annex29.net/extern/10_HELLSTROM_Zurich%20080519.pdf
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The strata can be anything from sand to crystalline hardrock, and depending on engineering factors the depth can be from {{convert|50|to|300|m|0}}. Spacings have ranged from {{convert|3|to|8|m}}. Thermal models can be used to predict seasonal temperature variation in the ground, including the establishment of a stable temperature regime which is achieved by matching the inputs and outputs of heat over one or more annual cycles. Warm-temperature seasonal heat stores can be created using borehole fields to store surplus heat captured in summer to actively raise the temperature of large thermal banks of soil so that heat can be extracted more easily (and more cheaply) in winter. Interseasonal Heat Transfer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/interseasonal_heat_transfer.html |title=Interseasonal Heat Transfer |publisher=Icax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses water circulating in pipes embedded in asphalt solar collectors to transfer heat to Thermal Banks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/thermalbank.html |title=Thermal Banks |publisher=Icax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; created in borehole fields. A ground source heat pump is used in winter to extract the warmth from the Thermal Bank to provide space heating via [[underfloor heating]]. A high Coefficient of Performance is obtained because the heat pump starts with a warm temperature of {{convert|25|°C|°F|abbr=on}} from the thermal store, instead of a cold temperature of {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}} from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/report_on_iht_by_trl.html |title=Report on Interseasonal Heat Transfer by the Highways Agency |publisher=Icax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A BTES operating at Richard Stockton College since 1995 at a peak of about {{convert|29|°C|°F|1|abbr=on}} consists of 400 boreholes {{convert|130|m|0}} deep under a {{convert|3.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} parking lot. It has a heat loss of 2% over six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Chrisopherson, Elizabeth G. (Exec. Producer) | title = Green Builders (segment interviewing Lynn Stiles) | medium = Television production | publisher = PBS | date = 19 April 2009 | url = https://www.pbs.org/greenbuilders/meet-the-builders/lynn-stiles.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper temperature limit for a BTES store is {{convert|85|°C|°F|abbr=on}} due to characteristics of the PEX pipe used for BHEs, but most do not approach that limit. Boreholes can be either grout- or water-filled depending on geological conditions, and usually have a life expectancy in excess of 100 years. Both a BTES and its associated district heating system can be expanded incrementally after operation begins, as at Neckarsulm, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Nussbicker-Lux | first1 = J. | contribution = Solar Thermal Combined with District Heating and Seasonal Heat Storage | title = Solar Thermal Combined with District Heating and Seasonal Heat Storage | series = OTTI Symposium Thermische Solarenergie | place = Bad Staffelstein | contribution-url = http://www.itw.uni-stuttgart.de/abteilungen/rationelleEnergie/pdfdateien/11-03.pdf | date = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
BTES stores generally do not impair use of the land, and can exist under buildings, agricultural fields and parking lots. An example of one of the several kinds of STES illustrates well the capability of interseasonal heat storage. In Alberta, Canada, the homes of the [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] (in operation since 2007), get 97% of their year-round heat from a district heat system that is supplied by solar heat from solar-thermal panels on garage roofs. This feat – a world record – is enabled by interseasonal heat storage in a large mass of native rock that is under a central park. The thermal exchange occurs via a cluster of 144 boreholes, drilled {{convert|37|m}} into the earth. Each borehole is {{convert|155|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter and contains a simple heat exchanger made of small diameter plastic pipe, through which water is circulated. No heat pumps are involved.&lt;ref name=drake1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Canadian Solar Community Sets New World Record for Energy Efficiency and Innovation | publisher = Natural Resources Canada | date = 5 October 2012 | url = http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/media-room/news-release/2012/6586 | accessdate = 21 April 2013}} {{cite web | title = Drake Landing Solar Community (webpage) | url = http://www.dlsc.ca/ | accessdate = 21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''CTES''' (cavern or mine thermal energy storage). STES stores are possible in flooded mines, purpose-built chambers, or abandoned underground oil stores (e.g. those mined into crystalline hardrock in Norway), if they are close enough to a heat (or cold) source and market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Michel | first1 = F.A. | contribution = Utilization of abandoned mine workings for thermal energy storage in Canada | title = Utilization of abandoned mine workings for thermal energy storage in Canada | series = Effstock Conference (11th International) -- Thermal Energy Storage for Efficiency and Sustainability | place = Stockholm | contribution-url = http://intraweb.stockton.edu/eyos/energy_studies/content/docs/effstock09/Session_11_1_Case%20studies_Overviews/105.pdf | date = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''Energy Pilings'''. During construction of large buildings, BHE heat exchangers much like those used for BTES stores have been spiraled inside the cages of reinforcement bars for pilings, with concrete then poured in place. The pilings and surrounding strata then become the storage medium.
** '''GIITS''' (geo interseasonal insulated thermal storage). During construction of any building with a primary slab floor, an area approximately the footprint of the building to be heated, and &gt; 1 m in depth, is insulated on all 6 sides typically with [[HDPE]] closed cell insulation. Pipes are used to transfer solar energy into the insulated area, as well as extracting heat as required on demand. If there is significant internal ground water flow, remedial actions are needed to prevent it.

===Surface and above ground technologies===
* '''Pit Storage'''. Lined, shallow dug pits that are filled with gravel and water as the storage medium are used for STES in many Danish district heating systems.

The conferences originally focused exclusively on STES, but now that those technologies are mature other topics such as [[Phase-change material|phase change materials (PCM)]] and electrical energy storage are also being covered. Since 1985 each conference has had "stock" (for storage) at the end of its name; e.g. EcoStock, ThermaStock.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Nordell | first = Bo | last2 = Gehlin | first2 = S. | title = ''30 years of thermal energy storage – a review of the IEA ECES stock conferences'' | publisher = IEA ECES | date = 2009 | url = http://www.iea-eces.org/files/30_years_of_stock_confrences__1_.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130901024022/http://www.iea-eces.org/files/30_years_of_stock_confrences__1_.pdf | archivedate = 2013-09-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are held at various locations around the world.

The IEA-ECES programme continues the work of the earlier ''International Council for Thermal Energy Storage'' which from 1978 to 1990 had a quarterly newsletter and was initially sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy. The newsletter was initially called ''ATES Newsletter,'' and after BTES became a feasible technology it was changed to ''STES Newsletter.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ''ATES Newsletter'' and ''STES Newsletter'' archive | date = 2012 | url = ftp://ftp.tech-env.com/pub/ENERGY/STES/Newslett }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Index for ''ATES Newsletter'' and ''STES Newsletter'' | date = 2012 | url = ftp://ftp.tech-env.com/pub/ENERGY/STES/index.pdf }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of STES for small, passively heated buildings==
Small passively heated buildings typically use the soil adjoining the building as a low-temperature seasonal heat store that in the annual cycle reaches a maximum temperature similar to average annual air temperature, with the temperature drawn down for heating in colder months. Such systems are a feature of building design, as some simple but significant differences from 'traditional' buildings are necessary. At a depth of about {{convert|20|ft|m||sigfig=1}} in the soil, the temperature is naturally stable within a year-round range,&lt;ref&gt;ICAX (webpage, undated). [http://www.icax.co.uk/Mean_Annual_Air_Temperature.html Mean Annual Air Temperature Determines Temperature in the Ground].&lt;/ref&gt; if the draw down does not exceed the natural capacity for solar restoration of heat. Such storage systems operate within a narrow range of storage temperatures over the course of a year, as opposed to the other STES systems described above for which large annual temperature differences are intended.

Two basic passive solar building technologies were developed in the US during the 1970s and 1980s. They utilize direct heat conduction to and from thermally isolated, moisture-protected soil as a seasonal storage medium for space heating, with direct conduction as the heat return method. In one method, "passive annual heat storage" (PAHS),&lt;ref&gt;EarthShelters (webpage, undated). [http://earthshelters.com/free/chapter-1 Improving the Earth Shelter. Chapter 1 in: Passive Annual Heat Storage – Improving the Design of Earth Shelters]&lt;/ref&gt; the building’s windows and other exterior surfaces capture solar heat which is transferred by conduction through the floors, walls, and sometimes the roof, into adjoining thermally buffered soil.

When the interior spaces are cooler than the storage medium, heat is conducted back to the living space.&lt;ref&gt;Geery, D. 1982. Solar Greenhouses: Underground&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hait, J. 1983. Passive Annual Heat Storage — Improving the Design of Earth Shelters.&lt;/ref&gt; The other method, “annualized geothermal solar” (AGS) uses a separate solar collector to capture heat. The collected heat is delivered to a storage device (soil, gravel bed or water tank) either passively by the convection of the heat transfer medium (e.g. air or water) or actively by pumping it. This method is usually implemented with a capacity designed for six months of heating.

A number of examples of the use of solar thermal storage from across the world include: [[Suffolk One]] a college in East Anglia, England, that uses a thermal collector of pipe buried in the bus turning area to collect solar energy that is then stored in 18 boreholes each {{convert|100|m|ft}} deep for use in winter heating. [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] in Canada uses solar thermal collectors on the garage roofs of 52 homes, which is then stored in an array of {{convert|35|m|ft}} deep boreholes. The ground can reach temperatures in excess of 70&amp;nbsp;°C which is then used to heat the houses passively. The scheme has been running successfully since 2007. In [http://www.solarge.org/index.php?id=1646 Brædstrup], Denmark, some {{convert|8000|m2|sqft}} of solar thermal collectors are used to collect some 4,000,000 kWh/year similarly stored in an array of {{convert|50|m|ft}} deep boreholes.

The design uses microprocessor control.

==Small buildings with internal STES water tanks==

A number of homes and small apartment buildings have demonstrated combining a large internal water tank for heat storage with roof-mounted solar-thermal collectors. Storage temperatures of {{convert|90|°C|°F|abbr=on}} are sufficient to supply both domestic hot water and space heating. The first such house was MIT Solar House #1, in 1939. An eight-unit apartment building in [[Oberburg, Bern|Oberburg]], [[Switzerland]] was built in 1989, with three tanks storing a total of {{convert|118|m3|cuft|abbr=in|0}} that store more heat than the building requires. Since 2011, that design is now being replicated in new buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Sun &amp; Wind Energy (2011). [http://www.jenni.ch/pdf/SunWindEnergy.pdf The solar house concept is spreading] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110023840/http://www.jenni.ch/pdf/SunWindEnergy.pdf |date=2013-11-10 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Berlin]], the “Zero Heating Energy House”, was built in 1997 in as part of the [[IEA Task 13]] low energy housing demonstration project. It stores water at temperatures up to {{convert|90|°C|°F|abbr=on}} inside a {{convert|20|m3|cuft|0|abbr=in}} tank in the [[basement]].&lt;ref&gt;Hestnes, A.; Hastings, R. (eds) (2003). Solar Energy Houses: Strategies, Technologies, Examples.

A similar example was built in [[Ireland]] in 2009, as a prototype. The ''solar seasonal store''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scanhome.ie/research/solarseasonal.php Scandinavian Homes Ltd, Research - Solar seasonal store]&lt;/ref&gt; consists of a {{convert|23|m3|cuft|0|abbr=on}} tank, filled with water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukstudentpassivhausconference.org.uk/uploads/4/7/2/1/4721930/shane_colclough_ph_conf_uk.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626170404/http://www.ukstudentpassivhausconference.org.uk/uploads/4/7/2/1/4721930/shane_colclough_ph_conf_uk.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was installed in the ground, heavily insulated all around, to store heat from [[Evacuated tube#Evacuated tube collectors|evacuated solar tubes]] during the year. The system was installed as an experiment to heat the ''world's first standardized pre-fabricated passive house''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructireland.ie/articles/0209passivehouse.php Construct Ireland Articles - Passive Resistance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003201628/http://www.constructireland.ie/articles/0209passivehouse.php |date=2006-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Galway|Galway, Ireland]]. The aim was to find out if this heat would be sufficient to eliminate the need for any electricity in the already highly efficient home during the winter months.

International Symposium on Strategies Towards Sustainability of Protected Cultivation in Mild Winter Climate. Also: EcoStock 2006. pp. 143-148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See slide 15 of Snijders (2008), above.&lt;/ref&gt; ATES is the kind of storage commonly in use for this application. In summer, the greenhouse is cooled with ground water, pumped from the “cold well” in the aquifer. The water is heated in the process, and is returned to the “warm well” in the aquifer. When the greenhouse needs heat, such as to extend the growing season, water is withdrawn from the warm well, becomes chilled while serving its heating function, and is returned to the cold well. This is a very efficient system of [[free cooling]], which uses only circulation pumps and no heat pumps.

In [[plate tectonics]], '''slab detachment''' or '''slab break-off''' may occur during [[continental collision|continent-continent]] or [[arc-continent]] collisions. When the [[continental margin]] of the subducting plate reaches the [[oceanic trench]] of the [[subduction|subduction zone]], the more buoyant [[continental crust]] will in normal circumstances experience only a limited amount of subduction into the asthenosphere. The [[slab pull]] forces will, however, still be present and this normally leads to the breaking off or detachment of the descending slab from the rest of the plate.&lt;ref name="van Hunen&amp;Allen_2011"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=van Hunen J. |last2=Allen M.B. |year=2011 |title=Continental collision and slab break-off: A comparison of 3-D numerical models with observations |url=http://eps.mcgill.ca/~courses/c350/ProbSets/vanHunen_2011_EPSL.pdf |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=302|issue=1–2 |pages=27–37 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2010.11.035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[isostasy|isostatic]] response to the detachment of the downgoing slab is rapid uplift. Slab detachment is also followed by the upwelling of relatively hot [[asthenosphere]] to fill the gap created, leading in many cases to [[magmatism]].&lt;ref name="Whalen_etal_"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Whalen J.B. |last2=McNicoll V.J. |last3=va Staal C.R. |last4=Lissenberg C.J. |last5=Longstaffe F.J. |last6=Jenner G.A. |last7=van Breeman O. |year=2006 |title=Spatial, temporal and geochemical characteristics of Silurian collision-zone magmatism, Newfoundland Appalachians: An example of a rapidly evolving magmatic system related to slab break-off |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/42335650/Spatial_temporal_and_geochemical_charact20160207-21893-lin7uk.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1520636122&amp;Signature=Izkv4cftUrza%2BSVqamtCaL8%2BZOk%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DSpatial_temporal_and_geochemical_charact.pdf |journal=Lithos |volume=89 |issue=3–4 |pages=377–404 |doi=10.1016/j.lithos.2005.12.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2446">The '''South Apennine mixed montane forests''' is an [[Ecoregion]], in the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[Biome]], located in the Southern [[Apennine Mountains]], in southern [[Italy]] and on [[Sicily]].

This ecoregion is restricted to the high mountain massifs of the regions of [[Basilicata]], [[Calabria]] and the island of Sicily.

==Altitudinal forest zones==
Wide altitudinal range results in several forest zones.

===Lowest elevations===
At lowest elevations the forests are characterized by the dominance of [[sclerophyll]]ous evergreen oak ''[[Quercus ilex]]'' and ''[[Quercus suber]]'', coniferous ''[[Stone Pine|Pinus pinea]]'' (Italian Stone Pine), and deciduous ''[[Quercus pubescens]]'', ''[[Fraxinus ornus]]'', ''[[Ostrya carpinifolia]]'' forests.

===Medium elevations===
At medium elevations the mixed deciduous forests of ''[[Quercus cerris]]'', ''[[Quercus pubescens]]'', ''[[Quercus frainetto]]'', ''[[Castanea sativa]]'',  ''[[Ostrya carpinifolia]]'' predominate.

===High elevations===
At high elevation altitudes there is a north-south slopes gradient of plant communities:
*'''South-facing plant communities:''' On south-facing slopes with cold and dry climate ''[[European Black Pine|Pinus laricio]]'' is the dominant species. ''Pinus laricio'' is also found on [[Mount Etna]] up to the timberline along with the Etna birch ''[[Betula aetniensis]]''. ''[[Pinus heldreichii]]'' leucodermis is found only [[Pollino Mountains]].
*'''North-facing plant communities:''' On north-facing slopes Silver fir ''[[Abies alba]]'' and beech ''[[Fagus sylvatica]]'' mix with ''Pinus laricio''. Relict stands of the endemic Nebrodi fir ''[[Abies nebrodensis]]'' appear in the [[Madonie Mountains]]. The Etna summits is characterized by a shrub community of ''[[Astragalus siculus]]'', ''[[Berberis|Berberis aetnensis]]'', ''[[Juniperus communis]]'' alpina and the Etna tree-broom ''[[Genista aetnensis]]''.

Note the white [[Madison Formation]] [[limestone]] repeated, with one example in the foreground (that pinches out with distance) and another to the upper right corner and top of the picture.]]
'''Thin-skinned deformation''' is a style of [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] in [[plate tectonics]]  at a [[convergent boundary]] which occurs with shallow [[thrust fault]]s that only involves cover rocks (typically [[sedimentary rock]]s), and not deeper [[basement rock]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson et al., 1997, Exploring Earth, An Introduction to Physical Geology, {{ISBN|0-13-463936-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thin-skinned style of deformation is typical of many [[fold and thrust belt]]s developed in the foreland of a collisional zone or back arc of a continental [[volcanic arc]]. This is particularly the case where a good basal [[decollement]] exists, usually in a weaker layer like a [[shale]], [[evaporite]], or a zone of high pore fluid pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchanddiscovery.com/documents/2007/07038hatcher/images/hatcher.pdf Hatcher, R.D. 2007. Confirmation of Thin-skinned Thrust Faulting in Foreland Fold-Thrust Belts and Its Impact on Hydrocarbon Exploration: Bally, Gordy, and Stewart, Bulletin of Canadian Petroleum Geology, 1966. First in the AAPG History of Petroleum Geology Series on Papers Having a Major Impact on Petroleum Geology: A contribution of the AAPG History of Petroleum Geology Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was first described in [[Rocky Mountains]] of the [[United States]], as part of the [[Sevier Orogeny]].

In the rock record, this will increase the influence of more surficial rocks, which usually includes [[sedimentary rock]]s.  Typically, you will see repeated sections of the same rock over and over as thrust faults, coming up from the decollement, stack the same layer on top of itself.  The sediments that are created by this type of deformation are typically [[lithic sandstone]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1803">In [[particle physics]], '''V''' was a generic name for heavy, unstable [[subatomic particle]]s that decay into a pair of particles, thereby producing a characteristic letter [[V]] in a [[bubble chamber]] or other [[particle detector]]. Such particles were first detected in [[cosmic ray]] interactions in the atmosphere in the late 1940s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=G.D.Rochester|first=C.C.Butler|title=Evidence for the Existence of New Unstable Elementary Particles|journal=Nature|volume=160|issue=4077|page=855|date=1947|bibcode=1947Natur.160..855R|doi=10.1038/160855a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were first produced using the [[Cosmotron]] [[particle accelerator]] at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pais|first=Abraham|title=Inward Bound|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=21|date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since all such particles have now been identified and given specific names, such as [[kaon|K meson]] or [[Sigma baryon]], this term has fallen into disuse.

V&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is still used on occasion to refer generally to [[neutral particle]]s that may confuse the [[B-tagging]] algorithms in a modern particle detector, as is used in Section 7 of

Vehicle-to-grid can be used with ''gridable'' vehicles, that is, plug-in electric vehicles (BEV and PHEV), with grid capacity. Since at any given time 95 percent of cars are parked, the batteries in electric vehicles could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the electric distribution network and back. This represents an estimated value to the utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car.&lt;ref name="future"&gt;{{cite web | date=2007-12-09 | title=Car Prototype Generates Electricity, And Cash | work=Science Daily | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071203133532.htm | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batteries have a finite number of charging cycles, as well as a shelf-life, therefore using vehicles as grid storage can impact battery longevity. Studies that cycle batteries two or more times per day have shown large decreases in capacity and greatly shortened life. However, battery capacity is a complex function of factors such as battery chemistry, charging and discharging rate, temperature, state of charge and age. Most studies with slower discharge rates show only a few percent of additional degradation while one study has suggested that improved longevity relative to vehicles that were not used for grid storage may be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uddin |first1=Kotub |last2=Jackson |first2=Tim |last3=Widanage |first3=Widanalage D. |last4=Chouchelamane |first4=Gael |last5=Jennings |first5=Paul A. |last6=Marco |first6=James |title=On the possibility of extending the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries through optimal V2G facilitated by an integrated vehicle and smart-grid system |journal=Energy |date=August 2017 |volume=133 |pages=710–722 |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the modulation of charging of a fleet of electric vehicles by an aggregator to offer services to the grid but without actual electrical flow from the vehicles to the grid is called unidirectional V2G, as opposed to the bidirectional V2G that is generally discussed in this article.&lt;ref&gt;Yong, Jia Ying, et al. "A review on the state-of-the-art technologies of electric vehicle, its impacts and prospects." Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 49 (2015): 365–385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sortomme, Eric, and Mohamed El-Sharkawi. "Optimal charging strategies for unidirectional vehicle-to-grid." Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on 2.1 (2011): 131-138.&lt;/ref&gt;
The company [[AC Propulsion]] coined the term V2G for vehicle-to-grid.&lt;ref name = "coin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Emadi |first= Ali |year=2005 |title=Handbook of Automotive Power Electronics and Motor Drives |page=34
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Peak load leveling===
The concept allows V2G vehicles to provide power to help balance loads by "valley filling" (charging at night when demand is low) and "[[peak shaving]]" (sending power back to the grid when demand is high, see [[duck curve]]). 
Peak load leveling can enable [[electric utility|utilities]] new ways to provide [[regulation service]]s (keeping voltage and frequency stable) and provide [[spinning reserve]]s (meet sudden demands for power). 
In future development, it has been proposed that such use of electric vehicles could buffer renewable power sources such as [[wind power]], for example, by storing excess energy produced during windy periods and providing it back to the grid during high load periods, thus effectively stabilizing the [[Intermittent power source|intermittency]] of wind power. Some see this application of vehicle-to-grid technology as a renewable energy approach that can penetrate the baseline electric market.

It has been proposed that [[public utilities]] would not have to build as many [[gas-fired power plant|natural gas or coal-fired power plant]]s to meet [[peak demand]] or as an insurance policy against [[Power outage|blackout]]s.&lt;ref name="woody"&gt;{{cite news |last=Woody |first=Todd |url=http://blogs.business2.com/greenwombat/2007/06/photo_green_wom.html |title=PG&amp;E's Battery Power Plans Could Jump Start Electric Car Market |work=Green Wombat |date=2007-06-12 |accessdate=2007-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814040717/http://blogs.business2.com/greenwombat/2007/06/photo_green_wom.html |archive-date=2007-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since demand can be measured locally by a simple frequency measurement, [[Dynamic demand (electric power)|dynamic load leveling]] can be provided as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=4317049 |inventor=SCHWEPPE, FRED C. |pubdate=1982-02-23 |title=Frequency adaptive, power-energy re-scheduler }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Carbitrage, a [[portmanteau]] of 'car' and '[[arbitrage]]', is sometimes used to refer to the minimum price of electricity at which a vehicle would discharge its battery.&lt;ref name="Smart_Garage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://projectgetready.com/docs/SmartGarageCharretteReport_2.10.pdf |title=RMI Smart Garage Charrette Report |publisher=Rocky Mountain Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007230703/http://projectgetready.com/docs/SmartGarageCharretteReport_2.10.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backup power===
Modern electric vehicles can generally store in their batteries more than an average home's daily energy demand. 
Even without a PHEV's gas generation capabilities such a vehicle could be used for emergency power for several days (for example, lighting, home appliances, etc.). 
This would be an example of Vehicle-to-home transmission (V2H). 
As such they may be seen as a complementary technology for intermittent renewable power resources such as wind or solar electric. Hydrogen FCEVs with tanks containing up to 5.6&amp;nbsp;kg of hydrogen can deliver more than 90 kWh of electricity.&lt;ref name="tudelft"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.delta.tudelft.nl/article/hydrogen-car-power-backup|title=Hydrogen car as power backup|last=Wassink|first=Jos|date=2016-07-18|website=Delta TU Delft|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficiency==
Any [[energy conversion]] has losses due to the [[laws of thermodynamics]]. 
Lower losses mean higher [[Energy conversion efficiency]]. 
Most modern battery electric vehicles use lithium-ion cells that can achieve round-trip efficiency greater than 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Valøen |first1=Lars Ole |last2=Shoesmith |first2=Mark I. |year=2007 |title=The effect of PHEV and HEV duty cycles on battery and battery pack performance |conference=2007 Plug-in Highway Electric Vehicle Conference |access-date=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The efficiency of the battery depends on factors like charge rate, charge state, battery [[state of health]], and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261873996_Energy_Regeneration_and_Efficiency_in_an_Electro-Hydraulic_Forklift_with_Lithium-Titanate_Batteries |title=Energy Regeneration and Efficiency in an Electro-Hydraulic Forklift with Lithium-Titanate Batteries, Chapter 5 Analysis.

The majority of losses, however, are in system components other than the battery. 
Power electronics, such as inverters, typically dominate overall losses.&lt;ref name=energy2017&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-05-15|title=Measurement of power loss during electric vehicle charging and discharging|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544217303730|journal=Energy|language=en|volume=127|pages=730–742|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2017.03.015|issn=0360-5442}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A study found overall round-trip efficiency for V2G system in the range of 53% to 62%'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-01-01|title=Comments on “Measurement of power loss during electric vehicle charging and discharging” – Notable findings for V2G economics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544217317863|journal=Energy|language=en|volume=142|pages=1139–1141|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2017.10.081|issn=0360-5442}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another study reports an efficiency of about 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-01-01|title=Reply to Shirazi and Sachs comments on “Measurement of Power Loss During Electric Vehicle Charging and Discharging”|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544217317851|journal=Energy|language=en|volume=142|pages=1142–1143|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2017.10.080|issn=0360-5442}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The overall efficiency however depends on several factors and can vary widely.&lt;ref name=energy2017 /&gt;

==Implementation by country==
{{update section|date=September 2018}}
{{newsrelease|section|date=September 2018}}
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
A study conducted in 2012 by the Idaho National Laboratory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/avta/pdfs/evse/v2g_power_flow_rpt.pdf |title=Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Power Flow |first1=Adrene |last1=Briones |first2=James |last2=Francfort |first3=Paul |last3=Heitmann |first4=Michael |last4=Schey |first5=Steven |last5=Schey |first6=John |last6=Smart |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2015-04-29 |publisher=Idaho National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{deadlink|date=September 2018}}
revealed the following estimations and future plans for V2G in various countries. It is important to note that this is difficult to quantify because the technology is still in its nascent stage, and is therefore difficult to reliably predict adoption of the technology around the world. The following list is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to give an idea of the scope of development and progress in these areas around the world.

===United States===
[[PJM Interconnection]] has envisioned using [[US Postal Service]] trucks, school buses and garbage trucks that remain unused overnight for grid connection.{{cn|date=September 2018}}
This could generate millions of dollars because these companies aid in storing and stabilizing some of the national grid's energy. 
The United States was projected to have one million electric vehicles on the road between 2015 and 2019.
Studies indicate that 160 new power plants will need to be built by 2020 to compensate for electric vehicles if integration with the grid does not move forward.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

===Japan===
In order to meet the 2030 target of 10 percent of Japan's energy being generated by renewable resources, a cost of $71.1 billion will be required for the upgrades of existing grid infrastructure. 
The Japanese charging infrastructure market is projected to grow from $118.6 million to $1.2 billion between 2015 and 2020.{{cn|date=September 2018}}
Starting in 2012, Nissan plans to bring to market a kit compatible with the LEAF EV that will be able to provide power back into a Japanese home. 
Currently, there is a prototype being tested in Japan. Average Japanese homes use 10 to 12 KWh/day, and with the LEAF's 24 KWh battery capacity, this kit could potentially provide up to two days of power.{{cn|date=September 2018}} 
Production in additional markets will follow upon Nissan's ability to properly complete adaptations.

===Denmark===
Denmark currently{{when|date=September 2018}} is a world leader in wind power generation. 
Initially, Denmark's goal is to replace 10% of all vehicles with PEVs, with an ultimate goal of a complete replacement to follow. The Edison Project implements a new set of goals that will allow enough turbines to be built to accommodate 50% of total power while using V2G to prevent negative impacts to the grid. Because of the unpredictability of wind, the Edison Project plans to use PEVs while they are plugged into the grid to store additional wind energy that the grid cannot handle. Then, during peak energy use hours, or when the wind is calm, the power stored in these PEVs will be fed back into the grid. To aid in the acceptance of EVs, policies have been enforced that create a tax differential between zero emission cars and traditional automobiles. The Danish PEV market value is expected to grow from $50 to $380 million between 2015 and 2020. PEV developmental progress and advancements pertaining to the use of renewable energy resources will make Denmark a market leader with respect to V2G innovation (ZigBee 2010).

Following the Edison project, the Nikola project was started&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nikola.droppages.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Nikola |access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focused on demonstrating the V2G technology in a lab setting, located at the Risø Campus (DTU). DTU is a partner along with Nuvve and Nissan. The Nikola project is finishing in 2016, and lays the groundwork for Parker, which will use a fleet of EVs to demonstrate the technology in a real-life setting. this project is partnered by [[Technical University of Denmark|DTU]],&lt;ref name=integration&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/101856208/ISGT2014IstanbulNikola_Final.pdf |title=The Nikola project intelligent electric vehicle integration |last1=Andersen |first1=Peter Bach |last2=Marinelli |first2=Mattia |last3=Olesen |first3=Ole Jan |last4=Andersen |first4=Claus Amtrup |last5=Poilasne |first5=Gregory |last6=Christensen |first6=Bjoern |last7=Alm |first7=Ole |publisher=Technical University of Denmark |year=2014 |access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insero]], [[Nuvve]], [[Nissan]] and [[Frederiksberg Forsyning]] (Danish DSO in Copenhagen). Besides demonstrating the technology the project also aims to clear the path for V2G-integration with other OEMs as well as calculating the business case for several types of V2G, such as Adaptive charging, overload protection, peak shaving, emergency backup and frequency balancing. The project starts in August 2016 and runs for 2 years. Other notable projects in Denmark are the SEEV4-City Interreg project which will demonstrate V2G in a car sharing fleet in the north harbour of Copenhagen and the ECOGrid 2.0, which will not include EVs but build the aggregator software to fully integrate it into the Danish electricity markets.

===United Kingdom===
The V2G market in the UK will be stimulated by aggressive smart grid and PEV rollouts. Starting in January 2011, programs and strategies to assist in PEV have been implemented. The UK has begun devising strategies to increase the speed of adoption of EVs. This includes providing universal high-speed internet for use with smart grid meters, because most V2G-capable PEVs will not coordinate with the larger grid without it. The "Electric Delivery Plan for London" states that by 2015, there will be 500 on-road charging stations; 2,000 stations off-road in car parks; and 22,000 privately owned stations installed. Local grid substations will need to be upgraded for drivers who cannot park on their own property. By 2020 in the UK, every residential home will have been offered a smart meter, and about 1.7 million PEVs should be on the road. The UK's electric vehicle market value is projected to grow from $0.1 to $1.3 billion between 2015 and 2020 (ZigBee 2010).

==Research==

=== Edison ===
[[Denmark]]'s Edison project, an abbreviation for 'Electric vehicles in a Distributed and Integrated market using Sustainable energy and Open Networks' was a partially state funded research project on the island of [[Bornholm]] in Eastern Denmark. The consortium of [[IBM]], [[Siemens]] the hardware and software developer EURISCO, Denmark's largest energy company [[Ørsted|Ørsted A/S]] (formerly DONG Energy), the regional energy company Østkraft, the [[Technical University of Denmark]] and the Danish Energy Association, explored how to balance the unpredictable electricity loads generated by Denmark's many wind farms, currently generating approximately 20 percent of the country's total electricity production, by using electric vehicles (EV) and their accumulators. The aim of the project is to develop infrastructure that enables EVs to intelligently communicate with the grid to determine when charging, and ultimately discharging, can take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intelligent power grid |url=http://www.zurich.ibm.com/edison/ |publisher=IBM Research |location=Zurich }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At least one rebuild V2G capable [[Scion xB|Toyota Scion]] will be used in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WP3 - DISTRIBUTED INTEGRATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT |url=http://www.edison-net.dk/~/media/EDISON/Reports/EDISON_WP3_-_Distributed_integration_technology_development.ashx |publisher=Edison |accessdate=2011-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The project is key in Denmark's ambitions to expand its wind-power generation to 50% by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title       = Danish Climate and Energy Policy |url         = http://www.ens.dk/en/policy/danish-climate-energy-policy |publisher   = Danish Energy Agency |year        = 2013 |access-date = 2016-03-08 |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160309050145/http://www.ens.dk/en/policy/danish-climate-energy-policy |archivedate = 2016-03-09 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a source of British newspaper The Guardian 'It's never been tried at this scale' previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Graham-Rowe |first=Duncan |title=Denmark to power electric cars by wind in vehicle-to-grid experiment |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/19/denmark-wind-electric-cars |publisher=The Guardian |location=London |date=2009-06-19 |accessdate=2011-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The project concluded in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edison-net.dk/EDISON%20closed.aspx |title=The Edison project is successfully closed!!! |website=Edison |first=Jan |last=Rasmussen |date=2013-07-11 |access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southwest Research Institute===
In 2014, [[Southwest Research Institute]] (SwRI) developed the first vehicle-to-grid aggregation system qualified by the [[Electric Reliability Council of Texas]] (ERCOT). The system allows for owners of electric delivery truck fleets to make money by assisting in managing the grid frequency. When the electric grid frequency drops below 60 Hertz, the system suspends vehicle charging which removes the load on the grid thus allowing the frequency to rise to a normal level. The system is the first of its kind because it operates autonomously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SwRI develops first ERCOT-qualified vehicle-to-grid aggregation system |url=http://www.swri.org/9what/releases/2014/vehicle-to-grid.htm#.VO66HfldWLY |website=Southwest Research Institute |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system was originally developed as part of the Smart Power Infrastructure Demonstration for Energy Reliability and Security (SPIDERS) Phase II program, led by Burns and McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. The goals of the SPIDERS program are to increase energy security in the event of power loss from a physical or cyber disruption, provide emergency power, and manage the grid more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPIDERS: The Smart Power Infrastructure Demonstration for Energy Reliability and Security|url=http://energy.sandia.gov/wp/wp-content/gallery/uploads/SPIDERS_Fact_Sheet_2012-1431P.pdf|publisher=Sandia National Laboratories}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, SwRI was awarded a $7 million contract from the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] to demonstrate the integration of vehicle-to-grid technologies as a source for emergency power at [[Fort Carson]], Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SwRI will participate in a U.S. Army program to demonstrate alternative sources for an emergency electrical power grid |url=http://www.swri.org/9what/releases/2012/army-spiders.htm |website=Southwest Research Institute |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, SwRI researchers tested five DC fast-charge stations at the army post. The system passed integration and acceptance testing in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SwRI deploys novel vehicle-to-grid aggregation system |url=http://www.swri.org/9what/releases/2013/vehicle-aggregation.htm#.VO66HvldWLY |website=Southwest Research Institute |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Delft University of Technology===
Prof. Dr. Ad van Wijk, Vincent Oldenbroek and Dr. Carla Robledo, researchers at [[Delft University of Technology]], in 2016 conducted research on V2G technology with hydrogen [[FCEV]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. Both experimental work with V2G FCEVs and techno-economic scenario studies for 100% renewable integrated energy and transport systems are done, using only hydrogen and electricity as energy carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oldenbroek|first=Vincent|last2=Verhoef|first2=Leendert A.|last3=van Wijk|first3=Ad J.

They developed together with the company Accenda b.v. a V2G unit converting the DC power of the FCEV into 3-phase AC power and injecting it into the Dutch national electricity grid.&lt;ref name="AppliedEnergy" /&gt; The Future Energy Systems Group also recently did tests with their V2G FCEVs whether it could offer frequency reserves. Based on the positive outcome of the tests an MSc thesis was published looking into the technical and economic feasibility assessment of a hydrogen and FCEV based Car Park as Power Plant offering frequency reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michelle|first=Poorte,|date=2017|title=Technical and economic feasibility assessment of a Car Park as Power Plant offering frequency reserves|url=https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:814c3699-8cf6-41b6-8633-c772dcc814e9?collection=education|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Delaware===
Dr. Willett Kempton, Dr. Suresh Advani, and Dr. Ajay Prasad are the researchers at the US [[University of Delaware]] who are currently conducting research on the V2G technology, with Dr. Kempton being the lead on the project. Dr. Kempton has published a number of articles on the technology and the concept, many of which can be found on the V2G project page.&lt;ref name="V2G"/&gt; The group is involved in researching the technology itself as well as its performance when used on the grid. In addition to the technical research, the team has worked with Dr. Meryl Gardner, a Marketing professor in the Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economic at the University of Delaware, to develop marketing strategies for both consumer and corporate fleet adoption.&lt;ref name="Messenger"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Elizabeth |last=Boyle |date=2007-11-28 |title=V2G Generates Electricity--And Cash |journal=UDaily | url=http://www.udel.edu/PR/UDaily/2008/nov/car112807.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 Toyota Scion xB car was modified for testing in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.udel.edu/V2G/resources/test-v2g-in-pjm-jan09.pdf |title=A Test of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) for Energy Storage and Frequency Regulation in the PJM System |first1=Willett |last1=Kempton |first2=Victor |last2=Udo |first3=Ken |last3=Huber |first4=Kevin |last4=Komara |first5=Steve |last5=Letendre |first6=Scott |last6=Baker |first7=Doug |last7=Brunner |first8=Nat |last8=Pearre |publisher=University of Delaware |date=November 2008 |access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory===
At [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], Dr. Samveg Saxena currently serves as the project lead for Vehicle-to-Grid Simulator (V2G-Sim).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=V2G-Sim |url=http://v2gsim.lbl.gov/home |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley Lab |access-date=2016-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
V2G-Sim is a simulation platform tool used to model spatial and temporal driving and charging behavior of individual plug-in electric vehicles on the electric grid. Its models are used to investigate the challenges and opportunities of V2G services, such as modulation of charging time and charging rate for peak [[demand response]] and [[utility frequency]] regulation. V2G-Sim has also been used to research the potential of plug-in electric vehicles for renewable energy integration. Preliminary findings using V2G-Sim have shown controlled V2G service can provide peak-shaving and valley-filling services to balance daily electric load and mitigate the [[duck curve]]. On the contrary, uncontrolled vehicle charging was shown to exacerbate the duck curve. The study also found that even at 20 percent fade in capacity, EV batteries still met the needs of 85 percent of drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Used EV Batteries Get New Life Powering the Grid |url=https://www.fleetcarma.com/used-ev-batteries-power-grid/ |publisher=Fleetcarma.com |access-date=2017-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another research initiative at Lawrence Berkeley Lab using V2G-Sim, V2G services were shown to have minor battery degradation impacts on electric vehicles as compared to cycling losses and calendar aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Dai |last1=Wang |first2=Samveg |last2=Saxena |first3=Jonathan |last3=Coignard |first4=Elpiniki |last4=Iosifidou |first5=Xiaohong |last5=Guan |date=2016-07-21 |title=Quantifying Electric Vehicle Battery Degradation from Driving vs. V2G Services |journal=2016 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM) |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7741180}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In this study, three electric vehicles with different daily driving itineraries were modelled over a ten-year time horizon, with and without V2G services. Assuming daily V2G service from 7PM to 9PM at a charging rate of 1.440&amp;nbsp;kW, the capacity losses of the electric vehicles due to V2G over ten years were 2.68%, 2.66%, and 2.62%.

===Nissan and Enel===
In May 2016, Nissan and [[Enel]] power company announced a collaborative V2G trial project in the United Kingdom, the first of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

 |access-date=2016-11-19
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The trial comprises 100 V2G charging units to be used by Nissan Leaf and e-NV200 electric van users. The project claims electric vehicle owners will be able to sell stored energy back to the grid at a profit.

One notable V2G project in the [[United States]] is at the [[University of Delaware]], where a V2G team headed by Dr. Willett Kempton has been conducting on-going research.&lt;ref name="V2G"&gt;{{cite web

Their goals are to educate the public about the environmental and economic benefits of V2G and enhance the product market.&lt;ref name="V2G"/&gt;
Other investigators are the [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]], [[Xcel Energy]], the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]], and, in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[University of Warwick]].&lt;ref name="NTY"&gt;{{cite journal

===University of Warwick===
WMG and Jaguar Land Rover collaborated with the Energy and Electrical Systems group of the university. Dr Kotub Uddin analysed lithium ion batteries from commercially available EVs over a two year period. He created a model of battery degradation and discovered that some patterns of vehicle-to-grid storage were able to significantly increase the longevity of the vehicle's battery over conventional charging strategies, while permitting them to be driven in normal ways.

==Skepticism==
There is some skepticism among experts about the feasibility of V2G. 
In 2007 an [[Environmental Defense]] representative stated: "It’s hard to take seriously the promises made for plug-in hybrids with {{Convert|30|mi}} all-electric range or any serious V2G application any time soon. It’s still in the science project stage."&lt;ref name="NTY"/&gt;
Most of skepticism comes from the cost of battery cycling and the dubious economics of V2G.&lt;ref name="NTY"/&gt;

The more a battery is used the sooner it needs replacing. Replacement cost is approximately 1/3 the cost of the electric car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://electricvehicles.caa.ca/frequently-asked-questions/#q7 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Canadian Automobile Association |work=Electric Vehicles |access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Over their lifespan, batteries degrade progressively with reduced capacity, cycle life, and safety due to chemical changes to the electrodes. Capacity loss/fade is expressed as a percentage of initial capacity after a number of cycles (e.g., 30% loss after 1,000 cycles). 
Cycling loss is due to usage and depends on both the maximum state of charge and the depth of discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://na.industrial.panasonic.com/sites/default/pidsa/files/uf103450pn_1.pdf |title=Lithium Ion UF103450P |publisher=Panasonic |year=2012 |access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[JB Straubel]], CTO of [[Tesla Inc.]], discounts V2G because battery wear outweighs economic benefit. 
He also prefers recycling over re-use for grid once batteries have reached the end of their useful car life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2016/08/22/vehicle-to-grid-used-ev-batteries-grid-storage/ |title=Why Vehicle-To-Grid &amp; Used EV Battery Storage Isn't Logical |first=Zachary |last=Shahan |work=Clean Technica |date=2016-08-22 |accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A 2017 study found decreasing capacity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.greencarcongress.com/2017/05/20170515-v2g.html |title=Green Car Congress: Hawaii study finds vehicle-to-grid discharge detrimental to EV batteries|work=www.greencarcongress.com |date= 2017-05-15 |accessdate= 2017-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthieu Dubarry, Arnaud Devie, Katherine McKenzie (2017) “Durability and reliability of electric vehicle batteries under electric utility grid operations: Bidirectional charging impact analysis,” Journal of Power Sources, Volume 358, pp. 39–49, doi: 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.05.015&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2012 hybrid-EV study found minor benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Scott B. "[http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1167&amp;context=dissertations Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles: battery degradation, grid support, emissions, and battery size tradeoffs]" (2012). Dissertations. Paper 167. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common criticism is related to the overall efficiency of the process.
Charging a battery system and returning that energy from the battery to the grid, which includes "inverting" the DC power back to AC inevitably incurs some losses.
This needs to be factored against potential cost savings, along with increased emissions if the original source of power is fossil based. 
This cycle of energy efficiency may be compared with the 70–80% efficiency of large-scale [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Levine |first1=John |title=Pumped Hydroelectric Energy Storage and Spatial Diversity of Wind Resources as Methods of Improving Utilization of Renewable Energy Sources |url=http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/energystorage/files/MSThesis_JGLevine_final.pdf |publisher=Colorado University |location=US |accessdate=2014-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is however limited by geography, water resources and environment.

== Vehicles ==
There are several electric vehicles that have been modified or are design to be compatible with V2G.
[[Hyundai ix35 FCEV]] from [[Delft University of Technology]] is modified with a 10&amp;nbsp;kW DC V2G output.&lt;ref name="tudelft" /&gt;
Some vehicles that have V2G capability include the [[REV 300 ACX]],{{cn|date=September 2018}} the [[Boulder Electric Vehicle]] 500 series and 1000 series trucks,{{cn|date=September 2018}} the [[ACPropulsion]] T-Zero, E-box and MINI-E,{{cn|date=September 2018}} the [[Nissan Leaf]] and [[Nissan e-NV200]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.enel.com/media/press/d/2017/12/accordo-nissan-enel-eng |title=Nissan and Enel present an agreement for two-years of electric mobility services included in the price of a new Nissan LEAF |publisher=Enel |location=Italy |date=2017-12-14 |access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV has a Vehicle To Home system in Japan that is also planned for roll out in Europe.{{cn|date=September 2018}}
