'''Agroecology''' is the study of [[applied ecology|ecological processes applied]] to [[agriculture|agricultural]] production systems. Bringing [[ecology#Fundamental principles of ecology|ecological principles]] to bear in [[agroecosystem]]s can suggest novel management approaches that would not otherwise be considered. The term is often used imprecisely and may refer to "a science, a movement, [or] a practice".&lt;ref&gt;Wezel, A., Bellon, S., Doré, T., Francis, C., Vallod, D., David, C. (2009). Agroecology as a science, a movement or a practice. A review. Agronomy for Sustainable Development (published online)&lt;/ref&gt; Agroecologists study a variety of agroecosystems. The field of agroecology is not associated with any one particular method of [[farming]], whether it be [[Organic farming|organic]], [[Integrated farming|integrated]], or [[Industrial agriculture|conventional]], [[Intensive farming|intensive]] or [[Extensive farming|extensive]]. However, it has much more in common with organic and integrated farming.&lt;ref&gt;Wibblemann et al. (2013) Mainstreaming Agroecology: Implications for Global Food and Farming Systems. {{cite web |url=http://futureoffood.org/pdfs/Coventry_University_2013_Maintstreaming_Agroecology.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522154628/http://futureoffood.org/pdfs/Coventry_University_2013_Maintstreaming_Agroecology.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological strategy==
Agroecologists do not unanimously oppose technology or inputs in agriculture but instead assess how, when, and if technology can be used in conjunction with natural, social and human assets.&lt;ref&gt;Pretty, Jules. 2008. Agricultural sustainability: concepts, principles and evidence. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, 363, 447-465.&lt;/ref&gt; Agroecology proposes a context- or site-specific manner of studying agroecosystems, and as such, it recognizes that there is no universal formula or recipe for the success and maximum well-being of an agroecosystem.  Thus, agroecology is not defined by certain management practices, such as the use of [[Biological control|natural enemies]] in place of [[insecticides]], or [[polyculture]] in place of [[monoculture]].

Instead, agroecologists may study questions related to the four system properties of agroecosystems: [[Ecology#Ecosystem productivity|productivity]], [[Ecological stability|stability]], [[sustainability]] and [[equitability]].&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Gordon R. 1985. Agroecosystem analysis. Agricultural Administration, 20, 31-55.&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to disciplines that are concerned with only one or some of these properties, agroecologists see all four properties as interconnected and integral to the success of an agroecosystem. Recognizing that these properties are found on varying spatial scales, agroecologists do not limit themselves to the study of agroecosystems at any one scale: gene-organism-population-community-ecosystem-landscape-biome, field-farm-community-region-state-country-continent-global.

Agroecologists study these four properties through an interdisciplinary lens, using natural sciences to understand elements of agroecosystems such as soil properties and plant-insect interactions, as well as using social sciences to understand the effects of farming practices on rural communities, economic constraints to developing new production methods, or cultural factors determining farming practices.

==Approaches==
Agroecologists do not always agree about what agroecology is or should be in the long-term. Different definitions of the term agroecology can be distinguished largely by the specificity with which one defines the term "ecology", as well as the term's potential political connotations. Definitions of agroecology, therefore, may be first grouped according to the specific contexts within which they situate agriculture.
Agroecology is defined by the [[OECD]] as "the study of the relation of agricultural crops and environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=81 Agroecology], Glossary of Statistical Terms&lt;/ref&gt; This definition refers to the "-ecology" part of "agroecology" narrowly as the natural environment. Following this definition, an agroecologist would study agriculture's various relationships with [[soil health]], water quality, air quality, meso- and micro-fauna, surrounding flora, environmental toxins, and other environmental contexts.

A more common definition of the word can be taken from Dalgaard et al., who refer to agroecology as the study of the interactions between plants, animals, humans and the environment within agricultural systems.  Consequently, agroecology is inherently multidisciplinary, including factors from [[agronomy]], [[ecology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]] and related disciplines.&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt; In this case, the "-ecology" portion of "agroecology is defined broadly to include social, cultural, and economic contexts as well. Francis et al. also expand the definition in the same way, but put more emphasis on the notion of food systems.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;

Agroecology is also defined differently according to geographic location. In the global south, the term often carries overtly political connotations. Such political definitions of the term usually ascribe to it the goals of social and economic justice; special attention, in this case, is often paid to the traditional farming knowledge of indigenous populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agroecology.org Agroecology.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422150352/http://www.agroecology.org/ |date=2006-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; North American and European uses of the term sometimes avoid the inclusion of such overtly political goals. In these cases, agroecology is seen more strictly as a scientific discipline with less specific social goals.

===Agro-population ecology===
This approach is derived from the science of ecology primarily based on [[population ecology]], which over the past three decades has been displacing the ecosystems biology of [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]].  Buttel explains the main difference between the two categories, saying that "the application of population ecology to agroecology involves the primacy not only of analyzing agroecosystems from the perspective of the [[population dynamics]] of their constituent species, and their relationships to [[climate]] and [[biogeochemistry]], but also there is a major emphasis placed on the role of [[genetics]]."&lt;ref name=buttel&gt;Buttel, Frederick. "Envisioning the Future Development of Farming in the USA: Agroecology between Extinction and Multifunctionality?" New Directions in Agroecology Research and Education (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous agroecology===

This concept was proposed by political ecologist Josep Garí to recognise and uphold the integrated agro-ecological practices of many indigenous peoples, who simultaneously and sustainably safeguard, manage and use ecosystems for agricultural, food, biodiversity and cultural purposes at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2001). Biodiversity and Indigenous Agroecology in Amazonia. Etnoecologica 5 (7): 21-37&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous agroecologies are not systems and practices halted in time, but keep co-evolving with new knowledge and resources, such as that provided by development projects, research initiatives and agro-biodiversity exchanges. In fact, the first agro-ecologists were indigenous peoples that advocated development policies and programmes to support their systems, rather than replacing them.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2000). The Political Ecology of Biodiversity. DPhil Dissertation, University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusive agroecology===
Rather than viewing agroecology as a subset of agriculture, Wojtkowski&lt;ref&gt;Wojtkowski, Paul A. (2002) Agroecological Perspectives in Agronomy, Forestry and Agroforestry. Science Publishers Inc., Enfield, NH, 356p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wojtkowski, Paul A. (2006) Introduction to Agroecology: Principles and Practices. Haworth Press, Binghamton, NY, 404p.&lt;/ref&gt; takes a more encompassing perspective. In this, natural ecology and agroecology are the major headings under ecology. Natural ecology is the study of organisms as they interact with and within natural environments. Correspondingly, agroecology is the basis for the land-use sciences. Here humans are the primary governing force for organisms within planned and managed, mostly terrestrial, environments.

As key headings, natural ecology and agroecology provide the theoretical base for their respective sciences. These theoretical bases overlap but differ in a major way. Economics has no role in the functioning of natural ecosystems whereas economics sets direction and purpose in agroecology.

Under agroecology are the three land-use sciences, [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], and [[agroforestry]]. Although these use their plant components in different ways, they share the same theoretical core.

Beyond this, the land-use sciences further subdivide. The subheadings include agronomy, [[organic farming]], traditional agriculture, [[permaculture]], and [[silviculture]]. Within this system of subdivisions, agroecology is philosophically neutral. The importance lies in providing a theoretical base hitherto lacking in the land-use sciences. This allows progress in biocomplex agroecosystems including the multi-species plantations of forestry and agroforestry.

==Applications==
To arrive at a point of view about a particular way of farming, an agroecologist would first seek to understand the contexts in which the farm(s) is(are) involved. Each farm may be inserted in a unique combination of factors or contexts. Each farmer may have their own premises about the meanings of an agricultural endeavor, and these meanings might be different from those of agroecologists. Generally, farmers seek a configuration that is viable in multiple contexts, such as family, financial, technical, political, logistical, market, environmental, spiritual. Agroecologists want to understand the behavior of those who seek livelihoods from plant and animal increase, acknowledging the organization and planning that is required to run a farm.

===Views on organic and non-organic milk production===

Because [[organic agriculture]] proclaims to sustain the health of soils, ecosystems, and people,&lt;ref&gt;IFOAM (International Federation for Organic Agriculture Movements)&lt;/ref&gt; it has much in common with Agroecology;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} this does not mean that Agroecology is synonymous with organic agriculture, nor that Agroecology views organic farming as the 'right' way of farming.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Also, it is important to point out that there are large differences in [[Organic food|organic standards]] among countries and certifying agencies.

Three of the main areas that agroecologists would look at in farms, would be: the environmental impacts, animal welfare issues, and the social aspects.

Environmental impacts caused by organic and non-organic milk production can vary significantly. For both cases, there are positive and negative environmental consequences.

Compared to conventional milk production, [[organic milk]] production tends to have lower [[eutrophication]] potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and phosphates (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of [[methane]].&lt;ref&gt;Boer, I J. M. 2003. Environmental impact assessment of conventional and organic milk production. Livestock Production Science. Vol 80, p 69–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Animal welfare]] issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

A key component of animal welfare is freedom to perform their innate (natural) behavior, and this is stated in one of the basic principles of organic agriculture. Also, there are other aspects of animal welfare to be considered – such as freedom from hunger, thirst, discomfort, injury, fear, distress, disease and pain. Because organic standards require loose housing systems, adequate bedding, restrictions on the area of slatted floors, a minimum [[forage]] proportion in the [[ruminant]] diets, and tend to limit stocking densities both on [[pasture]] and in housing for dairy cows, they potentially promote good foot and hoof health. Some studies show lower incidence of placenta retention, milk fever, abomasums displacement and other diseases in organic than in conventional dairy herds.&lt;ref&gt;Hovi, M. el al. 2003. Animal health and welfare in organic livestock production in Europe: current state and future challenges. Livestock Production Science. Vol 80, p 41–53.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the level of infections by parasites in organically managed herds is generally higher than in conventional herds.&lt;ref&gt;Bennedsgaard, T.W. et al. 2003. Eleven years of organic dairy production in Denmark: herd health and production related to time of conversion and compared to conventional production. Livestock production science. Vol 80, p 121-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social aspects of dairy enterprises include life quality of farmers, of farm labor, of rural and urban communities, and also includes public health.

Both organic and non-organic farms can have good and bad implications for the [[life quality]] of all the different people involved in that [[food chain]]. Issues like labor conditions, labor hours and labor rights, for instance, do not depend on the organic/non-organic characteristic of the farm; they can be more related to the socio-economical and cultural situations in which the farm is inserted, instead.

As for the public health or [[food safety]] concern, [[organic foods]] are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary.

In an organic dairy farm, an agroecologist could evaluate the following:

# Can the farm minimize environmental impacts and increase its level of sustainability, for instance by efficiently increasing the [[productivity]] of the animals to minimize [[waste]] of feed and of land use?
# Are there ways to improve the [[animal health|health status]] of the herd (in the case of organics, by using [[biological pest control|biological controls]], for instance)?
# Does this way of farming sustain good [[quality of life]] for the [[farmer]]s, their families, [[farmworker|rural labor]] and communities involved?

===Views on no-till farming===

[[no-till farming|No-tillage]] is one of the components of [[conservation agriculture]] practices and is considered more environmental friendly than complete [[tillage]].&lt;ref name=Garcia-Torres&gt;Garcia-Torres, L. et al. 2002. Summary of the Workshop on Soil Protection and Sustainable Agriculture organized by the EU Commission DG Environment and the DG Environmental Quality of the Spanish Ministry of Environment (Soria, Spain)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Branco, H. and Lal, R. 2008. Principles of Conservation Management. No Tillage-Farming (Ch.8). Springer Verlag. Netherlands. P. 195&lt;/ref&gt; There is a general consensus that no-till can increase carbon content of topsoils, especially when combined with cover crops, but whether this improves the function of soils as a carbon sink is contested.&lt;ref name=Garcia-Torres/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolliger, A. et al. 2006. Taking stock of the Brazilian "Zero Till Revolution": A review of landmark research and farmers' practice. Adv. Agron. Vol 91, p 47–110&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Baker, J. M., Ochsner, T. E., Venterea, R. T., &amp; Griffis, T. J. (2007). Tillage and soil carbon sequestration—What do we really know?. Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment, 118(1-4), 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Powlson, D. S., Stirling, C. M., Jat, M. L., Gerard, B. G., Palm, C. A., Sanchez, P. A., &amp; Cassman, K. G. (2014). Limited potential of no-till agriculture for climate change mitigation. Nature Climate Change, 4(8), 678.&lt;/ref&gt;

No-till can contribute to higher [[soil organic matter]] and organic carbon content in soils,&lt;ref name=Calegari&gt;Calegari, A. et al. 2008. Impact of Long-Term No-Tillage and Cropping System Management on Soil Organic Carbon in an Oxisol: A Model for Sustainability. Agronomy Journal. Vol 100, Issue 4, p 1013-1019&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, T. and Post, W. 2002. Soil Organic Carbon Sequestration Rates by Tillage and Crop Rotation: A Global Data Analysis. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 66:1930–1946&lt;/ref&gt; though reports of no-effects of no-tillage in organic matter and organic carbon soil contents also exist, depending on environmental and crop conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Machado, P.L.O.A. and Silva, C.A. 2001. Soil management under no-tillage systems in the tropics with special reference to Brazil. Nutr. Cycling Agroecosyst. Vol 61, p 119–130&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, no-till can indirectly reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by decreasing the use of fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=Calegari /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koga, N. et al. 2003. Fuel consumption-derived CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions under conventional and reduced tillage cropping systems in northern Japan. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment. Vol 99, p 213–219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most crops can benefit from the practice of no-till, but not all crops are suitable for complete no-till agriculture.&lt;ref name="Fleizo et al. 2002"&gt;Fleizo et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koller&gt;Koller, K. 2003. Techniques of soil tillage. Ed. Adel El Titi ([[CRC Press]])&lt;/ref&gt; Crops that do not perform well when competing with other plants that grow in untilled soil in their early stages can be best grown by using other conservation tillage practices, like a combination of [[strip-till]] with no-till areas.&lt;ref name=Koller/&gt; Also, crops which harvestable portion grows underground can have better results with strip-tillage,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} mainly in soils which are hard for plant roots to penetrate into deeper layers to access water and nutrients.

The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations,&lt;ref&gt;Pavuk, D.M. 1994. Influence of weeds within Zea mays crop plantings on populations of adult Diabrotica barberi and Diabrotica virgifera virgifera. Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment. Vol 50, p 165-175&lt;/ref&gt; which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Brust, B. Stinner &amp; D. McCartney. 1986. Predator activity and predation in corn agroecosystems. Environmental Entomology 15:1017-1021&lt;/ref&gt;

In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, G.W., and P.R. Hill. 2000. Fall strip-tillage systems. p. 193–199. In R.C. Reeder (ed.) Conservation tillage systems and management. MWPS-45, 2nd ed. Iowa State Univ., Ames.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Licht, M.A. and Al-Kaisi, M. 2005. Strip-tillage effect on seedbed soil temperature and other soil physical properties. Soil and Tillage Research. Vol 80, p 233-249&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to [[pathogen]]s, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds,&lt;!-- I thought tillage caused more weed problems than no-till? This is one of the main reasons no-tillage is practiced --&gt; it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for [[pest control]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, [[mulch-till]] and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.

In a no-till system, an agroecologist could&lt;!-- Would they ask these questions? Where did this section originate?--&gt; ask the following:

# Can the farm minimize environmental impacts and increase its level of sustainability; for instance by efficiently increasing the productivity of the crops to minimize land use?
# Does this way of farming sustain good quality of life for the farmers, their families, rural labor and [[communities|rural communities]] involved?

==History==

===Pre-WWII===
The notions and ideas relating to crop ecology have been around since at least 1911 when [[Franklin Hiram King|F.H. King]] released ''Farmers of Forty Centuries''. King was one of the pioneers as a proponent of more quantitative methods for characterization of water relations and physical properties of soils.&lt;ref name=francis&gt;{{cite journal |last=Francis |date=2003 |title=Agroecology: the ecology of food systems |journal=Journal of Sustainable Agriculture |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=99–118 |doi=10.1300/J064v22n03_10|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s the attempt to merge agronomy and ecology was born with the development of the field of crop ecology. Crop ecology's main concern was where crops would be best grown.&lt;ref name=gliess&gt;Gliessman, Stephen. R  Agroecology: Ecological Processes in Sustainable Agriculture. Ann Arbor: Sleeping Bear Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, it was only in 1928 that agronomy and ecology were formally linked by Klages.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klages, K.H.W. 1928. Crop ecology and ecological crop geography in the agronomic curriculum. J. Amer. Soc. Agron. 20:336-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention of the term agroecology was in 1928, with the publication of the term by Bensin in 1928.&lt;ref name=wezel/&gt; The book of Tischler (1965), was probably the first to be actually titled 'agroecology'.&lt;ref&gt;Tischler, W. (1965). Agrarökologie. Gustav Fischer Verlag, Jena, Germany, 499 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; He analysed the different components (plants, animals, soils and climate) and their interactions within an agroecosystem as well as the impact of human [[agricultural management]] on these components. Other books dealing with agroecology, but without using the term explicitly were published by the German zoologist Friederichs (1930) with his book on agricultural zoology and related ecological/environmental factors for plant protection,&lt;ref&gt;Friederichs, K. (1930) Die Grundfragen und Gesetzmäßigkeiten der land- und forstwirtschaftlichen Zoologie. Vol. 1: Ökologischer Teil, Vol. 2: Wirtschaftlicher Teil. Verlagsbuchhandlung Paul Parey, Berlin, Germany, 417 and 443 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and by American crop physiologist Hansen in 1939&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, B., Alrøe, H.F., Kristensen, E.S., 2001. Approaches to assess the [[environmental impact]] of [[organic agriculture|organic farming]] with particular regard to Denmark. Agric. Ecosys. Environ. 83, 11–26.&lt;/ref&gt; when both used the word as a synonym for the application of ecology within agriculture.&lt;ref name=dalgaard&gt;Dalgaard, Tommy, and Nicholas Hutchings, John Porter. "Agroecology, Scaling and Interdisciplinarity." Agriculture Ecosystems and Environment 100(2003): 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=This sentence seems self-contradictory. I.e., did they use the term or not?|date=July 2016}}

===Post-WWII===
Gliessman mentions that post-WWII, groups of scientists with ecologists gave more focus to experiments in the natural environment, while [[agronomist]]s dedicated their attention to the cultivated systems in agriculture.&lt;ref name=gliess/&gt; According to Gliessman,&lt;ref name=gliess/&gt; the two groups kept their research and interest apart until books and articles using the concept of agroecosystems and the word agroecology started to appear in 1970.&lt;ref name=wezel&gt;Wezel, A., Soldat, V. (2009). A quantitative and qualitative historical analysis of the scientific discipline agroecology. International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability 7 (1): 3-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dalgaard&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt; explains the different points of view in ecology schools, and the fundamental differences, which set the basis for the development of agroecology.  The early ecology school of [[Henry Gleason]] investigated plant populations focusing in the [[hierarchical]] levels of the organism under study.

Friederich Clement's ecology school, however included the organism in question as well as the higher hierarchical levels in its investigations, a "landscape perspective".  However, the ecological schools where the roots of agroecology lie are even broader in nature. The ecology school of [[Arthur Tansley|Tansley]],&lt;!--(1935)--&gt; whose view included both the biotic organism and their environment, is the one from which the concept of agroecosystems emerged in 1974 with Harper.&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harper, J.L., 1974. Agric. Ecosyst. Agroecosyst. 1, 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s the increasing awareness of how humans manage the landscape and its consequences set the stage for the necessary cross between agronomy and ecology. Even though, in many ways the [[environmental movement]] in the US was a product of the times, the  {{clarify|text=Green Decade,|date=July 2016}} spread an environmental awareness of the [[unintended consequence]]s of changing ecological processes. Works such as ''[[Silent Spring]]'', and  ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'', and  changes in legislation such as the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], [[Clean Water Act]], and the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] caused the public to be aware of societal growth patterns, agricultural production, and the overall capacity of the system.&lt;ref name=dalgaard/&gt;

===Fusion with ecology===
After the 1970s, when agronomists saw the value of ecology and ecologists began to use the agricultural systems as study plots, studies in agroecology grew more rapidly.&lt;ref name=gliess/&gt; Gliessman describes that the innovative work of Prof. Efraim Hernandez X., who developed research based on [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous systems of knowledge]] in [[Mexico]], led to education programs in agroecology.&lt;ref name=qFran&gt;qtd. in Francis ''et al.'' 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 Prof. Efraim Hernandez X. explained that modern agricultural systems had lost their ecological foundation when [[socio-economic]] factors became the only driving force in the [[food system]].&lt;ref name=francis/&gt; The acknowledgement that the socio-economic interactions are indeed one of the fundamental components of any agroecosystems came to light in 1982, with the article Agroecologia del Tropico Americano by Montaldo. The author argues that the socio-economic context cannot be separated from the agricultural systems when designing agricultural practices.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt;

In 1995 Edens et al. in Sustainable Agriculture and Integrated Farming Systems solidified this idea proving his point by devoting special sections to economics of the systems, ecological impacts, and ethics and values in agriculture.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt; Actually, 1985 ended up being a fertile and creative year for the new discipline. For instance in the same year, [[Miguel Altieri]] integrated how consolidation of the farms, and cropping systems impact pest populations. In addition, Gliessman highlighted that socio-economic, technological, and ecological components give rise to producer choices of food production systems.&lt;ref name=francis/&gt; These pioneering agroecologists have helped to frame the foundation of what we today consider the interdisciplinary field of agroecology and have led to advances in a number of farming systems. In Asian rice, for example, crop diversification by growing flowering crops in strips beside rice fields has recently been demonstrated to reduce pests so effectively (by the flower nectar attracting and supporting parasitoids and predators) that insecticide spraying is reduced by 70%, yields increase by 5%, together resulting in an economic advantage of 7.5% [http://www.nature.com/articles/nplants201614 (Gurr et al., 2016)].

== By region ==

The principles of agroecology are expressed differently depending on local ecological and social contexts.

=== Latin America ===

{{Main article|Agroecology in Latin America}}
Latin America's experiences with North American Green Revolution agricultural techniques have opened space for agroecologists.  Traditional or [[indigenous knowledge]] represents a wealth of possibility for agroecologists, including "exchange of wisdoms".  See Miguel Alteiri's ''Enhancing the Productivity of Latin American Traditional Peasant Farming Systems Through an Agroecological Approach'' for information on agroecology in Latin America.

Agroecological techniques and knowledge played an important role in solving the severe food crisis in [[Cuba]] following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Funes |first1=Fernando |last2=García |first2=Luis |last3=Bourque |first3=Martin |last4=Pérez |first4=Nilda |last5=Rosset |first5=Peter |title=Sustainable Agriculture and Resistance: Transforming Food Production in Cuba |location= Oakland, CA |publisher=Food First Books |isbn=0-935028-87-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of Cuba's urban agricultural movement, agroecology is integral to production in Cuban [[organopónico|organopónicos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10460-015-9659-y |title=Low-carbon food supply: The ecological geography of Cuban urban agriculture and agroecological theory |journal=Agriculture and Human Values |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=771–784 |year=2016 |last1=Cederlöf |first1=Gustav }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===

Historically, agroecology has had low traction in Africa, as governments, international organisations, extension services and farmers' organisations tended to focus on issues of inputs and outputs as the defining factors to deal with recurrent food crises and chronic malnutrition in the continent. Agrocecology was only a minor proposal from a few, non-governmental, small-scale projects and a sort of "experimental" idea of the Farmer Field Schools programme.

In the early 2000s, when the AIDS pandemic was creating a major rural crisis across Africa, Josep Garí proposed FAO to consider an agroecological approach as the most effective way to empower farmers cope with the impacts of the AIDS pandemic on agriculture and food production: in particular, he proposed agro-biodiversity as a key resource and knowledge for farmers to address the labour and malnutrition crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2003). Agrobiodiversity strategies to combat food insecurity and HIV/AIDS impact in rural Africa. FAO / Population and Development Service, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was rapidly adopted by the Farmer Field Schools scheme across the world, and even presented and translated in China.&lt;ref&gt;Garí, Josep A. (2004). Plant diversity, sustainable rural livelihoods and the HIV/AIDS crisis. Bangkok: UNDP &amp; FAO, 2004. Published in English and Chinese. {{ISBN|974-92021-4-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, agroecology has started to permeate projects and discourses on farming and natural-resource management in Africa. In 2011, the 1st encounter of agroecology trainers took place in Zimbabwe and issued the Shashe Declaration.

=== Madagascar ===
{{Main article|Agroecology in Madagascar}}
Most of the historical farming in Madagascar has been conducted by indigenous peoples.  The French [[Colonialism|colonial]] period disturbed a very small percentage of land area, and even included some useful experiments in [[Sustainable forestry]]. [[Slash-and-burn]] techniques, a component of some [[shifting cultivation]] systems have been practised by natives in Madagascar for centuries.  As of 2006 some of the major agricultural products from slash-and-burn methods are wood, charcoal and grass for [[Zebu]] grazing.  These practices have taken perhaps the greatest toll on land fertility since the end of French rule, mainly due to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures.

'''Audio system measurements''' are made for several purposes. Designers take measurements so that they can specify the performance of a piece of equipment. Maintenance engineers make them to ensure equipment is still working to specification, or to ensure that the cumulative defects of an audio path are within limits considered acceptable. Some aspects of measurement and specification relate only to intended usage. Audio system measurements often accommodate [[psychoacoustic]] principles to measure the system in a way that relates to human hearing.

== Subjectivity and frequency weighting ==
Subjectively valid methods came to prominence in consumer audio in the UK and Europe in the 1970s, when the introduction of [[compact cassette]] tape, [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]] and [[Dolby noise reduction]] techniques revealed the unsatisfactory nature of many basic engineering measurements. The specification of [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting|weighted CCIR-468 quasi-peak noise]], and [[flutter measurement|weighted quasi-peak wow and flutter]] became particularly widely used and attempts were made to find more valid methods for distortion measurement.

Measurements based on psychoacoustics, such as the measurement of [[noise (physics)|noise]], often use a [[weighting filter]]. It is well established that [[human hearing]] is more sensitive to some frequencies than others, as demonstrated by [[equal-loudness contours]], but it is not well appreciated that these contours vary depending on the type of sound. The measured curves for pure tones, for instance, are different from those for random noise. The ear also responds less well to short bursts, below 100 to 200 ms, than to continuous sounds&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Brian C. J., ''An Introduction to the Psychology of Hearing'', 2004, 5th ed. p137, Elsevier Press&lt;/ref&gt; such that a [[quasi-peak detector]] has been found to give the most representative results when noise contains click or bursts, as is often the case for noise in digital systems.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Research Report EL17, ''The Assessment of Noise in Audio Frequency Circuits'', 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, a set of subjectively valid measurement techniques have been devised and incorporated into BS, [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]], [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]] and [[ITU]] standards. These methods of [[audio quality measurement]] are used by broadcast engineers throughout most of the world, as well as by some audio professionals, though the older [[A-weighting]] standard for continuous tones is still commonly used by others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweetwater.com/expert-center/glossary/t--ANSIA-Weighting Expert center glossary]{{Failed verification|date=January 2011}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320214941/http://www.sweetwater.com/expert-center/glossary/t--ANSIA-Weighting |date=20 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No single measurement can assess audio quality. Instead, engineers use a series of measurements to analyze various types of degradation that can reduce fidelity. Thus, when testing an analogue tape machine it is necessary to [[wow and flutter measurement|test for wow and flutter]] and tape speed variations over longer periods, as well as for distortion and noise. When testing a digital system, testing for speed variations is normally considered unnecessary because of the accuracy of clocks in digital circuitry, but testing for [[aliasing]] and timing [[jitter]] is often desirable, as these have caused audible degradation in many systems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Once subjectively valid methods have been shown to correlate well with listening tests over a wide range of conditions, then such methods are generally adopted as preferred. Standard engineering methods are not always sufficient when comparing like with like. One CD player, for example, might have higher measured  noise than another CD player when measured with a RMS method, or even an A-weighted RMS method, yet sound quieter and measure lower when 468-weighting is used. This could be because it has more noise at high frequencies, or even at frequencies beyond 20&amp;nbsp;kHz, both of which are less important since human ears are less sensitive to them. (See [[noise shaping]].) This effect is how [[Dolby noise-reduction system#Dolby B|Dolby B]] works and why it was introduced. Cassette noise, which was predominately high frequency and unavoidable given the small size and speed of the recorded track could be made subjectively much less important. The noise sounded 10&amp;nbsp;dB quieter, but failed to measure much better unless 468-weighting was used rather than A-weighting.

== Measurable performance ==

=== Analog electrical ===
; [[Frequency response]] (FR) : This measurement tells you over what frequency range output level for an audio component will remain reasonably constant (either within a specified [[decibel]] range, or no more than a certain number of [[Decibel|dB]] from the amplitude at 1k[[Hertz|Hz]]). Some audio components such as tone controls are designed to adjust the loudness of signal content at particular frequencies, e.g., a [[bass (music)|bass]] control allows the attenuation or accentuation of low frequency signal content, in which case the specification may specify the frequency response is taken with tone controls "flat" or disabled. [[Preamplifiers]] may also contain [[equalization (audio)|equalizer]]s, [[filter (signal processing)|filter]]s for example to play [[LP album|LP]]s requiring [[RIAA]] frequency response correction, in which case the specification may describe how closely the response matches the standard.  By comparison, [[Frequency range]] is a term sometimes used of [[loudspeakers]] and other [[transducers]] to indicate the frequencies that are usable, without normally specifying a decibel range.  [[Power bandwidth]] is also related to frequency response - indicating the range of frequencies usable at high power (since frequency response measurements are normally taken at low signal levels, where [[slew rate]] limitations or [[transformer]] saturation would not be a problem.

: A component having a 'flat' frequency response will not change the weighting (i.e., intensity) of signal content across the specified frequency range. The frequency range often specified for audio components is between 20 [[Hertz|Hz]] to 20 kHz, which broadly reflects the human hearing range (the highest audible frequency for most people is less than 20 kHz, with 16 kHz being more typical &lt;ref&gt;Ashihara, Kaoru, [http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=JASMAN00012200000300EL52000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes "Hearing thresholds for pure tones above 16  kHz"], ''J. Acoust. Soc. Am.'' Volume 122, Issue 3, pp. EL52-EL57 (September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;). Components with 'flat' frequency responses are often described as being linear. Most audio components are designed to be linear across their entire operating range. Well-designed solid-state amplifiers and CD players may have a frequency response that varies by only 0.2 dB between 20 Hz to 20 kHz.&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, Bob, [http://ap.com/download/books "Audio Measurement Handbook"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621184958/http://ap.com/download/books |date=21 June 2009 }}, Second edition for PDF. Page 86 and 138. Audio Precision, USA. Retrieved 9 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Loudspeakers tend to have a considerably less flat frequency responses than this.

; [[Total harmonic distortion]] (THD) : Music material contains distinct tones, and some kinds of distortion involve spurious tones at double or triple the frequencies of those tones. Such harmonically related distortion is called harmonic distortion. For [[high fidelity]], this is usually expected to be &lt; 1% for electronic devices; mechanical elements such as loudspeakers usually have inescapable higher levels. Low distortion is relatively easy to achieve in electronics with use of [[negative feedback]], but the use of high levels of feedback in this manner has been the topic of much controversy among [[audiophile]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Essentially all loudspeakers produce more distortion than electronics, and 1–5% distortion is not unheard of at moderately loud listening levels. Human ears are less sensitive to distortion in the low frequencies, and levels are usually expected to be under 10% at loud playback. Distortion that creates only even-order harmonics for a sine wave input is sometimes considered less bothersome than odd-order distortion.

; [[Audio power|Output power]]
: Output power for amplifiers is ideally measured and quoted as maximum Root Mean Square ([[root mean square|RMS]]) [[power (physics)|power]] output per channel, at a specified distortion level at a particular load, which, by convention and government regulation, is considered the most meaningful measure of power available on music signals, though real, non-[[clipping (audio)|clipping]] music has a high [[peak-to-average ratio]], and usually averages well below the maximum possible. The commonly given measurement of PMPO (peak music power out) is largely meaningless and often used in marketing literature; in the late 1960s there was much controversy over this point and the US Government (FTA) required that RMS figures be quoted for all high fidelity equipment. Music power has been making a comeback in recent years. ''See also [[Audio power]].''
: Power specifications require the [[load impedance]] to be specified, and in some cases two figures will be given (for instance, the output power of a power amplifier for loudspeakers will be typically measured at 4 and 8 [[ohm]]s). To deliver maximum power to the load, the impedance of the driver should be the complex conjugate of the impedance of the load. In the case of a purely resistive load, the resistance of the driver should be equal to the resistance of the load to achieve maximum output power. This is referred to as [[impedance matching]].

; [[Intermodulation distortion]] (IMD) : Distortion that is not harmonically related to the signal being amplified is intermodulation distortion. It is a measure of the level of spurious signals resulting from unwanted combination of different frequency input signals. This effect results from non-linearities in the system. Sufficiently high levels of negative feedback can reduce this effect in an amplifier. Many believe it is better to design electronics in a way to minimize feedback levels, though this is difficult to achieve while meeting other high accuracy requirements. Intermodulation in loudspeaker drivers is, as with harmonic distortion, almost always larger than in most electronics. IMD increases with cone excursion. Reducing a driver's bandwidth directly reduces IMD. This is achieved by splitting the desired frequency range into separate bands and employing separate drivers for each band of frequencies, and feeding them through a [[Audio crossover|crossover filter network]]. Steep slope crossover filters are most effective at IMD reduction, but may be too expensive to implement using high-current components and may introduce ringing distortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xsgeo.com/course/filt.htm Excess Geophysics. ''FREQUENCY FILTERING in practice'']&lt;/ref&gt; Intermodulation distortion in multi-driver loudspeakers can be greatly reduced with the use of [[active crossover]], though it significantly increases system cost and complexity.

; [[Noise (physics)|Noise]] : The level of unwanted noise generated by the system itself, or by interference from external sources added to the signal. '''[[Hum (sound)|Hum]]''' usually refers to noise only at power line frequencies (as opposed to broadband [[white noise]]), which is introduced through induction of power line signals into the inputs of gain stages. Or from inadequately regulated power supplies.

; [[Crosstalk]] : The introduction of noise (from another signal channel) caused by ground currents, stray inductance or capacitance between components or lines. Crosstalk reduces, sometimes noticeably, separation between channels (e.g., in a stereo system). A [[crosstalk measurement]] yields a figure in dB relative to a nominal level of signal in the path receiving interference. Crosstalk is normally only a problem in equipment that processes multiple audio channels in the same chassis.

; [[Common-mode rejection ratio]] (CMRR) : In [[balanced audio]] systems, there are equal and opposite signals (difference-mode) in inputs, and any interference imposed on both leads will be subtracted, canceling out that interference (i.e., the common-mode). CMRR is a measure of a system's ability to ignore such interference, and especially hum at its input. It is generally only significant with long lines on an input, or when some kinds of [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]] problems exist. Unbalanced inputs do not have common mode resistance; induced noise on their inputs appears directly as noise or hum.

; [[Dynamic range]] ''and'' [[Signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) : The difference between the maximum level a component can accommodate and the noise level it produces. Input noise is not counted in this measurement. It is measured in dB.
: ''Dynamic range'' refers to the ratio of maximum to minimum loudness in a given signal source (e.g., music or programme material), and this measurement also quantifies the maximum dynamic range an audio system can carry. This is the ratio (usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]]) between the noise floor of the device with no signal and the maximum signal (usually a [[sine wave]]) that can be output at a specified (low) distortion level.
:Since the early 1990s it has been recommended by several authorities including the [[Audio Engineering Society]] that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.

: ''Signal-to-noise ratio'' (SNR), however, is the ratio between the noise floor and an arbitrary reference level or [[alignment level]]. In "professional" recording equipment, this reference level is usually +4 dBu (IEC 60268-17), though sometimes 0 dBu (UK and Europe - EBU standard Alignment level). 'Test level', 'measurement level' and 'line-up level' mean different things, often leading to confusion. In "consumer" equipment, no standard exists, though −10 dBV and −6 dBu are common.
: Different media characteristically exhibit different amounts of [[noise measurement|noise]] and [[Headroom (audio signal processing)|headroom]]. Though the values vary widely between units, a typical analogue [[compact cassette|cassette]] might give 60 [[decibel|dB]], a [[Compact disc|CD]] almost 100 dB. Most modern quality amplifiers have &gt;110 dB dynamic range,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.zainea.com/Dynamic%20range.htm|title = Dynamic-Range Issues in the Modern Digital Audio Environment|last = FIELDER|first = LOUIS D.|date = May 1, 1995|website = zainea.com|publisher = Dolby Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA 91403, USA|access-date = 7 March 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160626055428/http://www.zainea.com/Dynamic%20range.htm|archive-date = 26 June 2016|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which approaches that of the human [[ear]], usually taken as around 130 dB. See [[Programme levels]].

; [[Phase distortion]]'', ''[[Group delay]]'', and ''[[Phase delay]] : A perfect audio component will maintain the [[phase (waves)|phase]] coherency of a signal over the full range of frequencies. Phase distortion can be extremely difficult to reduce or eliminate. The human ear is largely insensitive to phase distortion, though it is exquisitely sensitive to relative phase relationships within heard sounds. The complex nature of our sensitivity to phase errors, coupled with the lack of a convenient test that delivers an easily understood quality rating, is the reason that it is not a part of conventional audio specifications.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Multi-driver loudspeaker systems may have complex phase distortions, caused or corrected by crossovers, driver placement, and the phase behaviour of the specific driver.

; [[Transient response]] : A system may have low distortion for a steady-state signal, but not on sudden transients. In amplifiers, this problem can be traced to power supplies in some instances, to insufficient high frequency performance or to excessive negative feedback. Related measurements are [[slew rate]] and [[rise time]]. Distortion in transient response can be hard to measure. Many otherwise good power amplifier designs have been found to have inadequate slew rates, by modern standards. In loudspeakers, transient response performance is affected by the mass and resonances of drivers and enclosures and by [[group delay and phase delay]] introduced by crossover filtering or inadequate time alignment of the loudspeaker's drivers. Most [[loudspeaker]]s generate significant amounts of transient distortion, though some designs are less prone to this (e.g. [[electrostatic loudspeaker]]s, [[plasma arc loudspeaker|plasma arc tweeters]], [[Tweeter#Ribbon tweeter|ribbon tweeter]]s and [[Loudspeaker enclosure#Multiple entry horn|horn enclosures with multiple entry points]]).

; [[Damping factor]] : A higher number is generally believed to be better. This is a measure of how well a power [[amplifier]] controls the undesired motion of a [[loudspeaker]] driver. An amplifier must be able to suppress [[resonance]]s caused by mechanical motion (e.g., [[inertia]]) of a speaker cone, especially a low frequency driver with greater mass. For conventional loudspeaker drivers, this essentially involves ensuring that the [[output impedance]] of the amplifier is close to zero and that the speaker wires are sufficiently short and have sufficiently large diameter. Damping factor is the ratio of the output impedance of an amplifier and connecting cables to the DC resistance of a [[voice coil]], which means that long, high resistance speaker wires will reduce the damping factor. A damping factor of 20 or greater is considered adequate for live [[sound reinforcement system]]s, as the SPL of inertia-related driver movement is 26&amp;nbsp;dB less than signal level and won't be heard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prosoundweb.com/article//what_is_loudspeaker_damping_damping_factor_df/ ProSoundWeb. Chuck McGregor, Community Professional Loudspeakers. September 1999. ''What is Loudspeaker Damping and Damping Factor (DF)?'']&lt;/ref&gt; Negative feedback in an amplifier lowers its effective output impedance and thus increases its damping factor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aikenamps.com/NegativeFeedback.htm Aiken Amplification.

=== Mechanical ===
; [[Wow (recording)|Wow]] and [[Flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]] : These measurements are related to physical motion in a component, largely the drive mechanism of [[analog signal|analogue]] media, such as [[vinyl record]]s and [[magnetic tape]]. "Wow" is slow speed (a few Hz) variation, caused by longer term drift of the drive motor speed, whereas "flutter" is faster speed (a few tens of Hz) variations, usually caused by mechanical defects such as out-of-roundness of the [[capstan (tape recorder)|capstan]] of a tape transport mechanism. The measurement is given in % and a lower number is better.

; Rumble : The measure of the low frequency (many tens of Hz) noise contributed by the [[phonograph|turntable]] of an analogue playback system. It is caused by imperfect bearings, uneven motor windings, vibrations in driving bands in some turntables, room vibrations (e.g., from traffic) that is transmitted by the turntable mounting and so to the phono cartridge. A lower number is better.

=== Digital ===

Note that digital systems do not suffer from many of these effects at a signal level, though the same processes occur in the circuitry, since the data being handled is ''symbolic''. As long as the symbol survives the transfer between components, and can be perfectly regenerated (e.g., by [[pulse shaping]] techniques) the data itself is perfectly maintained. The data is typically buffered in a memory, and is [[Clock signal|clocked]] out by a very precise [[crystal oscillator]]. The data usually does not degenerate as it passes through many stages, because each stage regenerates new symbols for transmission.

Digital systems have their own problems. Digitizing adds [[quantization noise|noise]], which is measurable and depends on the [[audio bit depth]] of the system, regardless of other quality issues. Timing errors in sampling clocks ([[jitter]]) result in non-linear distortion (FM modulation) of the signal. One quality measurement for a digital system (Bit Error Rate) relates to the probability of an error in transmission or reception. Other metrics on the quality of the system are defined by the [[sample rate]] and [[Audio bit depth|bit depth]]. In general, digital systems are much less prone to error than analog systems; However, nearly all digital systems have analog inputs and/or outputs, and certainly all of those that interact with the analog world do so. These analog components of the digital system can suffer analog effects and potentially compromise the integrity of a well designed digital system.

; [[Jitter]] : A measurement of the variation in period (periodic jitter) and absolute timing (random jitter) between measured clock timing versus an ideal clock. Less jitter is generally better for sampling systems.

; [[Sample rate]] : A specification of the rate at which measurements are taken of the analog signal. This is measured in samples per second, or [[hertz]]. A higher sampling rate allows a greater total bandwidth or pass-band frequency response and allows less-steep anti-aliasing/anti-imaging filters to be used in the stop-band, which can in turn improve overall phase linearity in the pass-band.

; [[Audio bit depth|Bit depth]] : In [[Pulse-code modulation]] audio, the bit depth is the number of [[bit]]s of information in each [[Sampling (signal processing)|sample]]. [[Quantization (signal processing)|Quantization]], a process used in digital audio sampling, creates an error in the [[Signal reconstruction|reconstructed signal]]. The [[Signal-to-quantization-noise ratio]] is a multiple of the bit depth.

:[[Compact Disc Digital Audio|Audio CDs]] use a bit depth of 16-bits, while [[DVD-Video]] and [[Blu-ray]] discs can use 24-bit audio. The maximum [[dynamic range]] of a 16-bit system is about 96dB,&lt;ref name="Middleton, Zak"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUw8oha56zwC&amp;pg=PA54 |page=54 |last1=Middleton |first1=Chris |last2=Zuk |first2=Allen |title=The Complete Guide to Digital Audio: A Comprehensive Introduction to Digital Sound and Music-Making |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2003 |isbn=978-1592001026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while for 24 bit it is about 144 dB.

:[[Dither]] can be used in [[audio mastering]] to randomize the [[quantization error]], and some dither systems use [[Noise shaping]] to spectral shape of the quantization noise floor. The use of shaped dither can increase the effective dynamic range of 16-bit audio to around 120&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;http://xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html “With use of shaped dither ... the effective dynamic range of 16 bit audio reaches 120dB in practice”&lt;/ref&gt;

:To calculate the maximum theoretical dynamic range of a digital system ([[Signal-to-quantization-noise ratio]] (SQNR)) use the following algorithm for bit depth Q:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SQNR} = 20 \log_{10}(2^Q) \approx 6.02 \cdot Q\ \mathrm{dB} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:Example: A [[16-bit]] system has 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; different possibilities, from 0 – 65,535. The smallest signal without dithering is 1, so the number of different levels is one less, 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; - 1. 
:So for a 16-bit digital system, the Dynamic Range is 20·log(2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; - 1) ≈ 96 dB.

; Sample accuracy/synchronization : Not as much a specification as an ability. Since independent digital audio devices are each run by their own [[crystal oscillator]], and no two crystals are exactly the same, the sample rate will be slightly different. This will cause the devices to drift apart over time. The effects of this can vary. If one digital device is used to monitor another digital device, this will cause dropouts or distortion in the audio, as one device will be producing more or less data than the other per unit time. If two independent devices record at the same time, one will lag the other more and more over time. This effect can be circumvented with a [[wordclock]] synchronization.  It can also be corrected in the digital domain using a drift correction algorithm.  Such an algorithm compares the relative rates of two or more devices and drops or adds samples from the streams of any devices that drift too far from the master device.  Sample rate will also vary slightly over time, as crystals change in temperature, etc.  See also [[clock recovery]]

; Linearity : ''Differential non-linearity'' and ''integral non-linearity'' are two measurements of the accuracy of an [[analog-to-digital converter]]. Basically, they measure how close the threshold levels for each bit are to the theoretical equally-spaced levels.

==Automated sequence testing==
Sequence testing uses a specific sequence of test signals, for frequency response, noise, distortion etc., generated and measured automatically to carry out a complete quality check on a piece of equipment or signal path. A single 32-second sequence was standardized by the [[EBU]] in 1985, incorporating 13 tones (40&amp;nbsp;Hz–15&amp;nbsp;kHz at −12&amp;nbsp;dB) for frequency response measurement, two tones for distortion (1024&amp;nbsp;Hz/60&amp;nbsp;Hz at +9&amp;nbsp;dB) plus crosstalk and compander tests. This sequence, which began with a 110-[[baud]] [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]] signal for synchronizing purposes, also became [[CCITT]] standard O.33 in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ITU-T Recommendation|title=Specifications for Measuring Equipment - Automatic Equipment for Rapidly Measuring Stereophonic Pairs and Monophonic Sound-Programme Circuits, Links and Connections|url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-O.33-199507-I/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lindos Electronics]] expanded the concept, retaining the FSK concept, and inventing segmented sequence testing, which separated each test into a 'segment' starting with an identifying character transmitted as 110-baud FSK so that these could be regarded as 'building blocks' for a complete test suited to a particular situation. Regardless of the mix chosen, the FSK provides both identification and synchronization for each segment, so that sequence tests sent over networks and even satellite links are automatically responded to by measuring equipment. Thus TUND represents a sequence made up of four segments which test the [[alignment level]], [[frequency response]], [[noise measurement|noise]] and [[distortion measurement|distortion]] in less than a minute, with many other tests, such as [[Wow and flutter measurement|Wow and flutter]], [[Headroom (audio signal processing)|Headroom]], and [[Crosstalk measurement|Crosstalk]] also available in segments as well as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

The Lindos sequence test system is now a 'de facto' standard {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}in broadcasting and many other areas of audio testing, with over 25 different segments recognized by Lindos test sets, and the EBU standard is no longer used.

== Unquantifiable? ==
Many audio components are tested for performance using objective and quantifiable measurements, e.g., THD, dynamic range and frequency response. Some take the view that objective measurements are useful and often relate well to subjective performance, i.e., the sound quality as experienced by the listener.&lt;ref&gt;Aczel, Peter, [http://www.theaudiocritic.com/back_issues/The_Audio_Critic_29_r.pdf "Audio Critic"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928214133/http://www.theaudiocritic.com/back_issues/The_Audio_Critic_29_r.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }}, ''Issue No. 29'', ''Our Last Hip-Boots Column'', page 5-6, Summer 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Floyd Toole has extensively [[Loudspeaker acoustics|evaluated loudspeakers]] in [[acoustical engineering]] research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.torontoaes.org/Seminar2008/bios/guests/Floyd_Toole.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cirmmt.org/activities/distinguished-lectures/toole&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[peer reviewed]] [[scientific journal]], Toole has presented findings that subjects have a range of abilities to distinguish good loudspeakers from bad, and that [[blind experiment|blind]] listening tests are more reliable than sighted tests. He found that subjects can more accurately perceive differences in speaker quality during [[monaural]] playback though a single loudspeaker, whereas subjective perception of [[stereophonic sound]] is more influenced by room effects.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160717035403/http://www.almainternational.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Pt_1_ASA_Providence_2014_with_notes_6-14.154134559.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One of Toole's papers showed that objective measurements of loudspeaker performance match subjective evaluations in listening tests.&lt;ref&gt;Toole, Floyd, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030403060501/http://www.harman.com/wp/pdf/AudioScience.pdf "Audio – Science in the Service of Art"], Harman International Industries Inc., 24 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that because human hearing and perception are not fully understood, listener experience should be valued above everything else. This tactic is often encountered in the [[High-end audio|high-end]] [[home audio]] world, where it is used to sell amplifiers with poor specifications. The usefulness of blind listening tests and common objective performance measurements, e.g., THD, are questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Harley, Robert, [http://www.stereophile.com/asweseeit/491awsi/ "Were Those Ears So Golden? DCC and PASC"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122034000/http://www.stereophile.com/asweseeit/491awsi/ |date=22 January 2009 }}, ''Stereophile'', ''As We See It'', April 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, crossover distortion at a given THD is much more audible than clipping distortion at the same THD, since the harmonics produced are at higher frequencies.  This does not imply that the defect is somehow unquantifiable or unmeasurable; just that a single THD number is inadequate to specify it and must be interpreted with care.  Taking THD measurements at different output levels would expose whether the distortion is clipping (which increases with level) or crossover (which decreases with level).

Whichever the view, some measurements have been traditionally used, despite having no objective value. For example, THD is an average of a number of harmonics equally weighted, even though research performed decades ago identifies that lower order harmonics are harder to hear at the same level, compared with higher order ones. In addition, even order harmonics are said to be generally harder to hear than odd order. A number of formulas that attempt to correlate THD with actual audibility have been published, however none have gained mainstream use.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The mass market consumer magazine ''[[Stereophile]]'' promotes the claim that home audio enthusiasts prefer sighted tests than blind tests.&lt;ref&gt;Harley, Robert, [http://stereophile.com/asweseeit/182/index2.html "Deeper Meanings"], ''Stereophile'', ''As We See It'', July 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, John, [http://stereophile.com/asweseeit/705awsi/ "Blind Tests &amp; Bus Stops"], ''Stereophile'', ''As We See It'', July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Made a phrase a bit clearer; "generally, once it reaches consumers" could be read to imply that the fragment applied to the mid-life of the product, rather than to products overall (i.e., it implied that a product is at midlife when it reaches consumers, which is more true in terms of a product's lifecycle, but not true for each instance of a product).</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3460">[[File:Bathtub curve.svg|thumb|right|350px|The 'bathtub curve' hazard function (blue, upper solid line) is a combination of a decreasing hazard of early failure (red dotted line) and an increasing hazard of wear-out failure (yellow dotted line), plus some constant hazard of random failure (green, lower solid line).]]

The '''bathtub curve''' is widely used in [[reliability engineering]]. It describes a particular form of the [[hazard function]] which comprises three parts:

*The first part is a decreasing [[failure rate]], known as early [[failure]]s.
*The second part is a constant failure rate, known as [[random]] failures.
*The third part is an increasing failure rate, known as wear-out failures.

The name is derived from the cross-sectional shape of a [[bathtub]]: steep sides and a flat bottom.

The bathtub curve is generated by mapping the rate of early "infant mortality" failures when first introduced, the rate of random failures with constant failure rate during its "useful life", and finally the rate of "wear out" failures as the product exceeds its design lifetime.

In less technical terms, in the early life of a product adhering to the bathtub curve, the failure rate is high but rapidly decreasing as defective products are identified and discarded, and early sources 
of potential failure such as handling and installation error are surmounted. In the mid-life of a product—generally speaking for consumer products—the failure rate is low and constant. In the late life of the product, the failure rate increases, as age and wear take their toll on the product. Many consumer product life cycles strongly exhibit the bathtub curve.&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig, H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-55840-0|pp=54|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the bathtub curve is useful, not every product or system follows a bathtub curve hazard function, for example if units are retired or have decreased use during or before the onset of the wear-out period, they will show fewer failures per unit calendar time (not per unit use time) than the bathtub curve.

The term "[[United States Military Standard|Military Specification]]" is often used to describe systems in which the infant mortality section of the bathtub curve has been [[Burn-in|burned out]] or removed. This is done mainly for life-critical or system-critical applications as it greatly reduces the possibility of the system failing early in its life. Manufacturers will do this at some cost generally by means similar to [[environmental stress screening]].

In reliability engineering, the [[cumulative distribution function]] corresponding to a bathtub curve may be analysed using a [[Weibull chart]].&lt;ref name="lienig" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="600">In [[telecommunication]], '''communications survivability''' is the ability of [[telecommunication|communications]] systems to continue to operate effectively under adverse conditions, though portions of the [[system]] may be damaged or destroyed. 

Various methods may be used to maintain communications services, such as using [[alternate routing]], different [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] media or methods, redundant equipment, and sites and equipment that are [[radiation hardened]].

In [[computability theory]], '''course-of-values recursion''' is a technique for defining [[number-theoretic function]]s by [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]]. In a definition of a function ''f'' by course-of-values recursion, the value of ''f''(''n''+1) is computed from the sequence &lt;math&gt;\langle f(1),f(2),\ldots,f(n)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. 

The fact that such definitions can be converted into definitions using a simpler form of recursion is often used to prove that functions defined by course-of-values recursion are [[primitive recursive]]. Contrary to course-of-values recursion, in primitive recursion the computation of a value of a function requires only the previous value; for example, for a [[arity|1-ary]] primitive recursive function ''g'' the value of ''g''(''n''+1) is computed only from ''g''(''n'') and ''n''.

==Definition and examples ==
The factorial function ''n''! is recursively defined by the rules
:&lt;math&gt;0! = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(n+1)! = n!(n+1).&lt;/math&gt;
This recursion is a '''primitive recursion''' because it computes the next value (''n''+1)! of the function based on the value of ''n'' and the previous value ''n''! of the function.  On the other hand, the function Fib(''n''), which returns the ''n''th [[Fibonacci number]], is defined with the recursion equations
:&lt;math&gt;Fib(0)  = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Fib(1) = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Fib(n+2) = Fib(n+1) + Fib(n).&lt;/math&gt;
In order to compute Fib(''n''+2), the last ''two'' values of the Fib function are required. Finally, consider the function ''g'' defined with the recursion equations
:&lt;math&gt;g(0) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(n+1) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} g(i)^{n-i}.&lt;/math&gt;
To compute ''g''(''n''+1) using these equations, all the previous values of ''g'' must be computed; no fixed finite number of previous values is sufficient in general for the computation of ''g''.  The functions Fib and ''g'' are examples of functions defined by course-of-values recursion. 

In general, a function ''f'' is defined by '''course-of-values recursion''' if there is a fixed primitive recursive function ''h'' such that for all ''n'', 
:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = h(n,\langle f(0), f(1), \ldots, f(n-1)\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\langle f(0), f(1), \ldots, f(n-1)\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Gödel_numbering_for_sequences|Gödel number]] encoding the indicated sequence.
In particular
:&lt;math&gt;f(0) = h(0,\langle\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;
provides the initial value of the recursion. The function ''h'' might test its first argument to provide explicit initial values, for instance for Fib one could use the function defined by
:&lt;math&gt;h(n,s)=\begin{cases}n&amp;\text{if }n&lt;2\\ s[n-2]+s[n-1]&amp;\text{if }n\geq2\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s''[''i''] denotes extraction of the element ''i'' from an encoded sequence ''s''; this is easily seen to be a primitive recursive function (assuming an appropriate Gödel numbering is used).

==Equivalence to primitive recursion ==

In order to convert a definition by course-of-values recursion into a primitive recursion, an auxiliary (helper) function is used. Suppose that one wants to have
:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = h(n,\langle f(0), f(1), \ldots, f(n-1)\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;.
To define {{math|''f''}} using primitive recursion, first define the auxiliary '''course-of-values function''' that should satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(n) = \langle  f(0), f(1), \ldots, f(n-1)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where the right hand side is taken to be a [[Gödel numbering for sequences]].

Thus &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(n)&lt;/math&gt; encodes the first {{math|''n''}} values of {{math|''f''}}. The function &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined by primitive recursion because &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(n+1)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by appending to &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(n)&lt;/math&gt; the new element &lt;math&gt;h(n,\bar{f}(n))&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(0) = \langle\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(n+1) = \mathit{append}(n,\bar{f}(n),h(n,\bar{f}(n))),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''append''(''n'',''s'',''x'')}} computes, whenever {{math|''s''}} encodes a sequence of length {{math|''n''}}, a new sequence {{math|''t''}} of length {{math|''n'' + 1}} such that {{math|''t''[''n''] {{=}} ''x''}} and {{math|''t''[''i''] {{=}} ''s''[''i'']}} for all {{math|''i'' &amp;lt; ''n''}}. This is a primitive recursive function, under the assumption of an appropriate Gödel numbering; ''h'' is assumed primitive recursive to begin with. Thus the recursion relation can be written as primitive recursion:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(n+1) = g(n,\bar{f}(n))&lt;/math&gt;
where ''g'' is itself primitive recursive, being the composition of two such functions:
:&lt;math&gt;g(i,j) = \mathit{append}(i,j,h(i,j)),&lt;/math&gt;

Given &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt;, the original function {{math|''f''}} can be defined by &lt;math&gt;f(n)=\bar{f}(n+1)[n]&lt;/math&gt;, which shows that it is also a primitive recursive function.

==Application to primitive recursive functions==
In the context of [[primitive recursive function]]s, it is convenient to have a means to represent finite sequences of natural numbers as single natural numbers.  One such method, [[Gödel's encoding]], represents a sequence of positive integers &lt;math&gt;\langle n_0,n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_k\rangle&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i = 0}^k p_i^{n_i}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; represent the ''i''th prime.  It can be shown that, with this representation, the ordinary operations on sequences are all primitive recursive.  These operations include
*Determining the length of a sequence,
*Extracting an element from a sequence given its index,
*Concatenating two sequences. 
Using this representation of sequences, it can be seen that if ''h''(''m'') is primitive recursive then the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = h(\langle f(0), f(1), f(2), \ldots, f(n-1)\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;.
is also primitive recursive.

When the sequence &lt;math&gt;\langle n_0,n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_k\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is allowed to include zeros, it is instead represented as
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i = 0}^k p_i^{(n_i +1)}&lt;/math&gt;,
which makes it possible to distinguish the codes for the sequences &lt;math&gt;\langle 0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle 0,0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

== Limitations ==
Not every recursive definition can be transformed into a primitive recursive definition. One known example is [[Ackermann's function]], which is of the form ''A''(''m'',''n'') and is provably not primitive recursive.

Indeed, every new value ''A''(''m''+1, ''n'') depends on the sequence of previously defined values ''A''(''i'', ''j''), but the ''i''-s and ''j''-s for which values should be included in this sequence depend themselves on previously computed values of the function; namely (''i'', ''j'') =  (''m'',''A''(''m''+1,''n'')). Thus one cannot encode the previously computed sequence of values in a primitive recursive way in the manner suggested above (or at all, as it turns out this function is not primitive recursive).

'''Dermatophyte test medium''' (DTM) is a specialized [[agar]] used in medical [[mycology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neogen.com/Acumedia/pdf/ProdInfo/7265_PI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bd.com/ds/technicalCenter/inserts/8814091%2803%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on [[Sabouraud's dextrose agar]] with added [[cycloheximide]] to inhibit [[saprotrophic]] growth, [[antibiotic]] to inhibit [[bacterial]] growth, and phenol red a [[pH]] indicator. The pH indicator is useful in distinguishing a [[dermatophyte]] [[fungus]], which utilizes [[nitrogen]]ous material for preferred metabolism, producing [[alkaline]] by-products, imparting a red color change to the medium. Typical saprotrophic fungi utilize [[carbohydrate]]s in the medium producing [[acidic]] by-products and no red color change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6892">In [[automata theory]], a '''deterministic pushdown automaton''' ('''DPDA''' or '''DPA''') is a variation of the [[pushdown automaton]]. The class of deterministic pushdown automata accepts the [[deterministic context-free language]]s, a proper subset of [[context-free language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Michael Sipser]] | year = 1997 | title = Introduction to the Theory of Computation | publisher = PWS Publishing | isbn = 0-534-94728-X | page = 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine transitions are based on the current state and input symbol, and also the current topmost symbol of the stack.  Symbols lower in the stack are not visible and have no immediate effect. Machine actions include pushing, popping, or replacing the stack top.  A deterministic pushdown automaton has at most one legal transition for the same combination of input symbol, state, and top stack symbol. This is where it differs from the nondeterministic pushdown automaton.

== Formal definition ==
A (not necessarily deterministic) '''PDA''' &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; can be defined as a 7-tuple:

:&lt;math&gt;M=(Q\,, \Sigma\,, \Gamma\,, q_0\,, Z_0\,, A\,, \delta\,)&lt;/math&gt;

where

*&lt;math&gt;Q\,&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of states
*&lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of input symbols
*&lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of stack symbols
*&lt;math&gt;q_0\,\in Q\,&lt;/math&gt; is the start state
*&lt;math&gt;Z_0\,\in\Gamma\,&lt;/math&gt; is the starting stack symbol
*&lt;math&gt;A\,\subseteq Q\,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the set of accepting states
*&lt;math&gt;\delta\,&lt;/math&gt; is a transition function, where
:&lt;math&gt;\delta\colon(Q\, \times ( \Sigma\, \cup \left \{ \varepsilon\, \right \} ) \times \Gamma\,) \longrightarrow \mathcal{P}(Q \times \Gamma ^{*})&lt;/math&gt;
: where &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kleene star]], meaning that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is "the set of all finite strings (including the [[empty string]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;) of elements of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;", &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[empty string]], and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[power set]] of a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

''M'' is ''deterministic'' if it satisfies both the following conditions:
* For any &lt;math&gt;q \in Q, a \in \Sigma \cup \left \{ \varepsilon \right \}, x \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;\delta(q,a,x)\,&lt;/math&gt; has at most one element.
*For any &lt;math&gt;q \in Q, x \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\delta(q, \varepsilon, x) \not= \emptyset\,&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\delta\left( q,a,x \right) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;a \in \Sigma.&lt;/math&gt;

There are two possible acceptance criteria: acceptance by ''empty stack'' and acceptance by ''final state''. The two are not equivalent for the deterministic pushdown automaton (although they are for the non-deterministic pushdown automaton). The languages accepted by ''empty stack'' are those languages that are accepted by ''final state'' and are prefix-free: no word in the language is the prefix of another word in the language.

The usual acceptance criterion is ''final state'', and it is this acceptance criterion which is used to define the [[deterministic context-free languages]].

== Languages recognized ==

If &lt;math&gt;L(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a language accepted by a PDA &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, it can also be accepted by a DPDA if and only if there is a single computation from the initial configuration until an accepting one for all strings belonging to &lt;math&gt;L(A)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;L(A)&lt;/math&gt; can be accepted by a PDA it is a context free language and if it can be accepted by a DPDA it is a deterministic context-free language.

Not all context-free languages are deterministic. This makes the DPDA a strictly weaker device than the PDA. For example, the language of even-length [[palindrome]]s on the alphabet of 0 and 1 has the context-free grammar S → 0S0 | 1S1 | ε.  An arbitrary string of this language cannot be parsed without reading all its letters first which means that a pushdown automaton has to try alternative state transitions to accommodate for the different possible lengths of a semi-parsed string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[John Hopcroft|Hopcroft]] | first = John |author2=[[Rajeev Motwani]] |author3=[[Jeffrey Ullman]] | title = [[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]] |edition=2 | year = 2001 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | pages = 249–253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restricting the DPDA to a single state reduces the class of languages accepted to the [[LL(1) language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kurki-Suonio | first1 = R. | title = Notes on top-down languages | doi = 10.1007/BF01946814 | journal = BIT | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 225–238 | year = 1969 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a PDA, this restriction has no effect on the class of languages accepted.

== Properties ==

=== Closure ===
Closure properties of deterministic context-free languages (accepted by deterministic PDA by final state) are drastically different from the context-free languages. As an example they are (effectively) closed under complementation, but not closed under union. To prove that the complement of a language accepted by a deterministic PDA is also accepted by a deterministic PDA is tricky.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In principle one has to avoid infinite computations.

As a consequence of the complementation it is decidable whether a deterministic PDA accepts all words over its input alphabet, by testing its complement for emptiness. This is not possible for context-free grammars (hence not for general PDA).

=== Equivalence problem ===
Géraud Sénizergues (1997) proved that the equivalence problem for deterministic PDA (i.e. given two deterministic PDA A and B, is L(A)=L(B)?) is decidable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sénizergues|first=Géraud|title=The equivalence problem for deterministic pushdown automata is decidable|journal=Automata, Languages and Programming|year=1997|volume=1256/1997|pages=671–681|doi=10.1007/3-540-63165-8_221|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-540-63165-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a proof that earned him the 2002 [[Gödel Prize]]. For nondeterministic PDA, equivalence is undecidable.

An '''ESD simulator''', also known as an '''ESD gun''', is a handheld unit used to test the immunity of devices to [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD). These simulators are used in special [[electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) laboratories.&lt;ref name="ptltl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenix-testlab.de/en/testlabs/index.jsp|title=Test Laboratory|publisher=Phoenix Testlab|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taafla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a2la.org/scopepdf/1954-01.pdf|title=The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESD pulses are fast, high-voltage pulses created when two objects with different electrical charges come into close proximity or contact. Recreating them in a test environment helps to verify that the [[device under test]] is immune to [[static electricity]] discharges.

ESD testing is necessary to receive a [[CE mark]], and for most suppliers of components for motor vehicles as part of required [[electromagnetic compatibility]] testing.&lt;ref name="esd standards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esda.org/esd_fundamentals.html|title=Fundamentals of ESD - Part Six ESD Standards|year=2001|publisher=Electrostatic Discharge Association|accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often useful to automate these tests to eliminate the [[human factor]].&lt;ref name="teseq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teseq.com/com/en/service_support/technical_information/07_AN_NSG_439.pdf|title=Automated ESD testing improves product reliability and safety|publisher=teseq|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three distinct test models for electrostatic discharge: human-body, machine, and charged-devices models. The human-body model emulates the action of a human body discharging static electricity, the machine model simulates static discharge from a machine, and the charged-device model simulates the charging and discharging events that occur in production processes and equipment.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Many ESD guns have interchangeable modules containing different discharge Networks or RC Modules (Specific [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] and [[capacitance]] values) to simulate different discharges. These modules typically slide into the handle of the pistol portion of the ESD simulator, much like loading some handguns. They change the characteristics of the waveshape discharged from the pistol and are called out in general standards like [[Emc directives|IEC 61000-4-2]], SAE J113 and industry specific standards like ISO 10605. Resistance is referred to in ohms (Ω), capacitance is referred to in [[picofarad]] (pF or "puff"). The most commonly used discharge network is for IEC 61000-4-2 and ISO 10605, expressed as 150pF/330Ω. There are over 50 combinations of resistance and capacitance depending on the standards and the applicable electronics.&lt;ref name="esdguns.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esdguns.com/order-online/discharge-rc-modules|title=RC Modules / Discharge Networks|publisher=ESDGuns.com|accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7426">The results of the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] can be used to look at the equilibrium situation for a quantum ideal '''gas in a harmonic trap''', which is a harmonic potential containing a large number of particles that do not interact with each other except for instantaneous thermalizing collisions. This situation is of great practical importance since many experimental studies of [[Bose gas]]es are conducted in such harmonic traps.

Using the results from either [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]], [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] or [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] we use the
[[Thomas-Fermi approximation]] and go to the limit of a very large trap, and express the degeneracy of the energy states (&lt;math&gt;g_{i}&lt;/math&gt;) as a differential, and summations over states as integrals. We will then be in a position to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the gas using the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] or the [[grand partition function]]. Only the case of massive particles will be considered, although the results can be extended to massless particles as well, much as was done in the case of the ideal [[gas in a box]]. More complete calculations will be left to separate articles, but some simple examples will be given in this article.

==Thomas Fermi approximation for the degeneracy of states==
For massive particles in a harmonic well, the states of the particle are enumerated by a set of quantum numbers &lt;math&gt;[n_x,n_y,n_z]&lt;/math&gt;. The energy of a particular state is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;E=\hbar\omega\left(n_x+n_y+n_z+3/2\right)~~~~~~~~n_i=0,1,2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose each set of quantum numbers specify &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; states where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the number of internal degrees of freedom of the particle that can be altered by collision. For example, a spin-1/2 particle would have &lt;math&gt;f = 2&lt;/math&gt;, one for each spin state. We can think of each possible state of a particle as a point on a 3-dimensional grid of positive integers. The Thomas-Fermi approximation assumes that the quantum numbers are so large that they may be considered to be a continuum. For large values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, we can estimate the number of states with energy less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; from the above equation as:

:&lt;math&gt;g=f\,\frac{n^3}{6}=f\,\frac{(E/\hbar\omega)^3}{6}&lt;/math&gt;

which is just &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; times the volume of the tetrahedron formed by the plane described by the energy equation and the bounding planes of the positive octant. The number of states with energy between &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E + dE&lt;/math&gt; is therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;dg=\frac{1}{2}\,fn^2\,dn=\frac{f}{(\hbar\omega\beta)^3}~\frac{1}{2}~\beta^3 E^2\,dE&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that in using this continuum approximation, we have lost the ability to characterize the low-energy states, including the ground state where &lt;math&gt;n_{i} = 0&lt;/math&gt;. For most cases this will not be a problem, but when considering Bose–Einstein
condensation, in which a large portion of the gas is in or near the ground state, we will need to recover the ability to deal with low energy states.

Without using the continuum approximation, the number of particles with energy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;N_i = \frac{g_i}{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Phi=e^{\beta(\epsilon_i-\mu)}&lt;/math&gt;
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for particles obeying [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Phi=e^{\beta(\epsilon_i-\mu)}-1&lt;/math&gt;
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for particles obeying [[Bose–Einstein statistics]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Phi=e^{\beta(\epsilon_i-\mu)}+1&lt;/math&gt;
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for particles obeying [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]
|}

with &lt;math&gt;\beta=1/kT&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; being [[Boltzmann's constant]], &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; being [[temperature]], and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; being the [[chemical potential]]. Using the continuum approximation, the number of particles &lt;math&gt;dN&lt;/math&gt; with energy between &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E + dE&lt;/math&gt; is now written:

:&lt;math&gt;dN= \frac{dg}{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;

==The energy distribution function==
We are now in a position to determine some distribution functions for the "gas in a harmonic trap." The distribution function for any variable &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;P_{A}dA&lt;/math&gt; and is equal to the fraction of particles which have values for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A + dA&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;P_A~dA = \frac{dN}{N} = \frac{dg}{N\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_A P_A~dA = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Using these relationships we obtain the energy distribution function:

:&lt;math&gt;P_E~dE = \frac{1}{N}\,\left(\frac{f}{(\hbar\omega\beta)^3}\right)~\frac{1}{2} \frac{\beta^3E^2}{\Phi}\,dE&lt;/math&gt;

==Specific examples==

The following sections give an example of results for some specific cases.

===Massive Maxwell–Boltzmann particles===

For this case:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi=e^{\beta(E-\mu)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating the energy distribution function and solving for &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; gives:

:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{f}{(\hbar\omega\beta)^3}~e^{\beta\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into the original energy distribution function gives:

:&lt;math&gt;P_E~dE = \frac{\beta^3 E^2 e^{-\beta E}}{2}\,dE&lt;/math&gt;

===Massive Bose–Einstein particles===

For this case:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi=e^{\beta \epsilon}/z-1\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;z=e^{\beta\mu}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating the energy distribution function and solving for &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; gives:

:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{f}{(\hbar\omega\beta)^3}~\textrm{Li}_3(z)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;Li_{s}(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[polylogarithm]] function. The polylogarithm term must always be positive and real, which means its value will go from 0 to &lt;math&gt;\zeta(3)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; goes from 0 to 1. As the temperature goes to zero, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; will become larger and larger, until finally &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; will reach a critical value &lt;math&gt;\beta_{c}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;z = 1&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{f}{(\hbar\omega\beta_c)^3}~\zeta(3)&lt;/math&gt;

The temperature at which &lt;math&gt;\beta = \beta_{c}&lt;/math&gt; is the critical temperature at which a Bose–Einstein condensate begins to form. The problem is, as mentioned above, the ground state has been ignored in the continuum approximation. It turns out that the above expression expresses the number of bosons in excited states rather well, and so we may write:

:&lt;math&gt;N=\frac{g_0z}{1-z}+\frac{f}{(\hbar\omega\beta)^3}~\textrm{Li}_3(z)&lt;/math&gt;

where the added term is the number of particles in the ground state. (The ground state energy has been ignored.) This equation will hold down to zero temperature. Further results can be found in the article on the ideal [[Bose gas]].

===Massive Fermi–Dirac particles (e.g. electrons in a metal)===

For this case:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi=e^{\beta(E-\mu)}+1\,&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating the energy distribution function gives:

:&lt;math&gt;1=\frac{f}{(\hbar\omega\beta)^3}~\left[-\textrm{Li}_3(-z)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where again, &lt;math&gt;Li_{s}(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[polylogarithm]] function. Further results can be found in the article on the ideal [[Fermi gas]].

'''''Homo consumericus''''' ([[mock Latin]] for consumerist person) is a [[neologism]] used in the social sciences, notably by [[Gad Saad]] in his book ''The Evolutionary Bases of Consumption''&lt;ref&gt;Gad Saad, ''The Evolutionary Bases of Consumption'' (Routledge, 2007) {{ISBN|0-8058-5149-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Gilles Lipovetsky]] in ''Le Bonheur Paradoxal''.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Lipovetsky, ''Le bonheur paradoxal, Essai sur la société d'hyperconsommation'', (éditions Gallimard, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; According to these and other scholars the phenomenon of [[mass consumption]] could be compared to certain traits of human psychology described by [[Evolution theory|evolutionary scientists]] pointing out similarities between [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] principles and [[consumer behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmsb.concordia.ca/~GadSaad/Jill%20Sundie-%20Review%20of%20my%20book.pdf Jill M.

==History==
'''1979'''   The International Institute of Forecasters was started by J. Scott Armstrong, Spyros Makridakis, Robert Carbone, and Robert Fildes, with support from INSEAD. The first journal was published by Wiley Publishing: the Journal of Forecasting. The objectives of the journal and the future ISFs were to promote the “Science of Forecasting” and scientific research. Within the first 2 years of publication, the journal had one of the highest citation rates.

'''1981'''   The first International Symposium on Forecasting (ISF) took place in Quebec with the goal of promoting the journal and generating content. The first conference started with invited papers from important names in the field, including Nobel Prize recipients.

'''1982'''   As part of ISF 1982, the IIF first began taking membership

'''1983'''   The ISF took place in Philadelphia, with Scott Armstrong as General Chair. Through mass advertising and promotion, including WSJ, Economist, an interview on Voice of America, and a direct mail piece sent to 300,000, the attendance was the highest in ISF history, approximately 1,000 attendees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2871">The '''laser voltage probe (LVP)''' is a laser-based voltage and timing [[waveform]] acquisition system which is used to perform [[failure analysis]] on [[Flip chip|flip-chip]] integrated circuits. The device to be analyzed is de-encapsulated in order to expose the silicon surface. The [[Wafer (electronics)|silicon substrate]] is thinned mechanically using a back side mechanical thinning tool. The thinned device is then mounted on a movable stage and connected to an electrical stimulus source. Signal measurements are performed through the back side of the device after substrate thinning has been performed. The device being probed must be electrically stimulated using a repeating test pattern, with a trigger pulse provided to the LVP as reference. The operation of the LVP is similar to that of a sampling oscilloscope.

==Theory of operation==
The LVP instrument measures voltage waveform signals in the device diffusion regions. Device imaging is accomplished through the use of a [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy|laser scanning microscope]] (LSM). The LVP uses dual [[infrared]] (IR) [[laser]]s to perform both device imaging and waveform acquisition. One laser is used to acquire images or waveforms from the device, while the second laser provides a reference which may be used to subtract unwanted noise from the signal data being acquired. On an electrically active device, the instrument monitors the changes in the phase of the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] field surrounding a signal being applied to a junction.

The instrument obtains voltage waveform and timing information by monitoring the interaction of [[laser]] light with the changes in the electric field across a [[p-n junction]]. As the [[laser]] reaches the silicon surface, a certain amount of that light is reflected back. The amount of reflected [[laser]] light from the junction is sampled at various points in time. The changing [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] field at the [[P-n junction|junction]] affects the amount of laser light that is reflected back. By plotting the variations in reflected laser light versus time, it is possible to construct a timing waveform of the signal at the junction. As the test pattern continues to loop, additional measurements are acquired and averaged into the previous measurements. Over a period of time, this averaging of measurements produces a more refined waveform. The end result is a waveform that is representative of the electrical signal present at the [[P-n junction|junction]].

'''Liudmila Grigorievna Kovnatskaya''' (born 5 February 1941) is a Russian musicologist. She is a professor at the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|St Petersburg State Conservatoire named after N. Rimsky-Korsakov]] (1987), and the Chief Researcher at the Russian Institute of Fine Arts History in St Petersburg. She is considered an Honoured Art Worker of Russian Federation.

==Education==
She graduated in 1965 from two departments at the Leningrad State Conservatoire named after N. Rimsky-Korsakov: the department of History of Music and Piano Performing Faculty, and the department of Organ Playing, having studied under Prof Isai Braudo. It was at the Conservatoire that she finished a postgraduate course in the department of History of Western Music, under the supervision of Prof Dr Mikhail Druskin. In 1970 Liudmila Kovnatskaya presented a candidate dissertation on Benjamin Britten’s oeuvre. In 1987 she completed a doctoral dissertation on English music of 20th century, at the Moscow research institute of Arts of Academy of Science, USSR.

==Professional experience==
Since 1987 Prof Kovnatskaya is a member of [[Union of Soviet Composers|Russian Composers’ Union]], and she was a member of the General Council for Cultural Affairs of St Petersburg from 1987 until 1993. In 2002 she became a member of the Council (Directorium) of the IMS. In the same year, she became a member of the editorial board of the journal “Tempo” (Cambridge).

In 2001 Prof Kovnatskaya became a materials consultant on Russian music for "The Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians" (London: McMillan, 2001). She was also a guest lecturer at the University of Manchester (1991), the Aldeburgh Festival (UK), and the Ural Conservatoire in Yekaterinburg.

Liudmila Kovnatskaya is the author of a monograph about [[Benjamin Britten]] (Moscow, 1974), in the book “English Music in the 20th Century: Sources and periods of development” (Moscow, 1986). Thanks to her research and organization activity in Russia, various festivals and concerts were organized, which were dedicated to English classic music, including Britten. Among them were “Ars Britannica” (1988–1990), the festival in honour of “The 80th anniversary of B. Britten” (1993), “The World of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]” (1996), the festival of Britten’s music on his 85th anniversary (1998), the jubilee concert in honour of Britten and [[Saint Cecilia]], patron saint of musicians (2003), the concert “World of Opera: Benjamin Britten”, and others.

Prof Kovnatskaya’s research fields include [[Music of Russia|History of Russian Music]]; she has written, edited and compiled books and articles on [[Dmitri Shostakovich|D. Shostakovich]]. Among her non-published manuscripts one can find a monumental work entitled “Ideological control of Musical avant-garde of 1920s: Leningrad Association of Contemporary Music in reports and other materials” (Soros Foundation Funding).

Shostakovich, Schoenberg, Britten, Purcell, Tippet, Arensky, Balakirev, English music, Russian-English connections, M. S. Druskin, A. Schweitzer and the Soviet musical epoch – all these subjects were established by Prof Kovnatskaya due to her intensive and rigorous nature as a researcher, editor and author of books, proceedings, collections and many-volume editions.

A separate field of her research and publishing activity is the ‘offering to the Teacher’, who was a famous musicologist and Professor of Leningrad Conservatoire Mikhail Druskin. In 2009, thanks to Prof Kovnatskaya, a two-volume collection was published, entitled “Memory to Mikhail Semenovich Druskin”, which united articles, recollections, biographical materials and correspondence. All who knew M. Druskin as a musician, musicologist and teacher took part in the creation of this 1000 page book. Furthermore, in addition to this, Liudmila Kovnatskaya led the task of re-publishing works by Druskin and, as a result, realized an extensive project: a 7-volume Collected Works. At present, the first volume, “Clavir music”, and the fourth volume, “Igor Stravinsky”, are published.

'''Malacology'''&lt;ref&gt;From French ''malacologie'', contraction of malacozoologie, from [[New Latin]] Malacozoa "zoological group including soft-bodied animals" from Greek [[wikt:μαλακός|μαλακός]] - ''malakos'' "soft" + [[wikt:ζῷον|ζῷον]] "animal.&lt;/ref&gt; is the branch of [[invertebrate]] [[zoology]] that deals with the study of the [[Mollusca]] (mollusks or molluscs), the second-largest [[phylum]] of animals in terms of described [[species]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/malacology/|title=Home - Division of Invertebrate Zoology|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208135845/http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/malacology/|archivedate=2007-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[arthropod]]s. Mollusks include [[snail]]s and [[slug]]s, [[clam]]s, [[octopus]] and [[squid]], and numerous other kinds, many of which have [[mollusc shell|shells]]. One division of malacology, [[conchology]], is devoted to the study of mollusk shells. Malacology derives from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μαλακός}}, ''malakos'', "soft"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''.

Fields within malacological research include [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[ecology]] and [[evolution]]. Applied malacology studies medical, veterinary, and agricultural applications, for example mollusks as vectors of disease, as in [[schistosomiasis]].

[[Archaeology]] employs malacology to understand the evolution of the [[climate]], the biota of the area, and the usage of the site.

In 1681, [[Filippo Bonanni]] wrote the first book ever published that was solely about seashells, the shells of marine mollusks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/shells/bounanni.php |title=Buonanni's Chiocciole (1681) |work=ansp.org |accessdate=8 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322225631/http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/shells/bounanni.php |archivedate=22 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was entitled: ''Ricreatione dell' occhio e dela mente nell oservation' delle Chiociolle, proposta a' curiosi delle opere della natura, &amp;c.''&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [[Filippo Bonanni|Bonanni F.]] 1681.

Zoological methods are used in malacological research. Malacological field methods and laboratory methods (such as collecting, documenting and archiving, and molecular techniques) were summarized by Sturm et al. (2006).&lt;ref name="Dillon R.

== Malacologists ==
{{main|List of malacologists}}
Those who study malacology are known as malacologists. Those who study primarily or exclusively the  [[mollusc shell|shells]] of mollusks are known as [[conchologist]]s.

The '''Mesozoic–Cenozoic Radiation''' is the third major extended increase in [[biodiversity]] in the [[Phanerozoic]], after the [[Cambrian Explosion]] and the [[Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event]]. The Mesozoic–Cenozoic Radiation began in the mid-[[Mesozoic]] and extends through the [[Cenozoic]], with no indication of having yet ended. It differs from the earlier radiations in that the diversity appears largely in the variety of [[species]] and other [[taxa]] below the level of [[order (biology)|order]]. "The spectacular radiation of the [[angiosperm]]s, [[mammal]]s and certain [[reptile]] groups (such as the snakes) on land is matched by that of the planktonic [[foraminifera]], neo[[gastropods]], heteroconch [[bivalve]]s, [[Cheilostomata|cheilostome]] [[bryozoan]]s, [[Decapoda|decapod]] [[crustacean]]s and [[teleost]] fish in shallow seas."&lt;ref&gt;page 5 in {{cite book|author=Owen AW &amp; Crame JA|chapter=Palaeobiogeography and the Ordovician and Mesozoic-Cenozoic biotic radiations|pages=1–11|editor=Crame JA and Owen AW|series=Geological Society Special Publications|number=194|title=Palaeobiogeography and Biodiversity Change: the Ordovician and Mesozoic-Cenozoic Radiations|location=London|publisher=[[Geological Society of London|The Geological Society]]|year=2002|isbn=1-86239-106-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hallam A|authorlink=Anthony Hallam|title=An Outline of Phanerozoic Biogeography|series=Oxford Biogeography|number=10|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780198540618}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marine diversification is largely that represented by the modern [[evolutionary fauna]], and there are also the terrestrial diversifications of the [[bird]]s and among the [[insect]]s.

'''[[Soil carbon]] [[carbon sink|storage]]''' is an important function of terrestrial [[ecosystem]]s. [[Soil]] contains more [[carbon]] than [[plant]]s and the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] combined.&lt;ref&gt;Tarnocai et al. 2009. Soil organic carbon pools in the northern circumpolar permafrost region. Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 23(2) doi: 10.1029/2008GB003327&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding what maintains the soil carbon pool is important to understand the current distribution of carbon on Earth, and how it will respond to environmental change. While much research has been done on how plants, free-living microbial [[decomposer]]s, and soil minerals affect this pool of carbon, it is recently coming to light that '''[[mycorrhizal fungi]]'''—symbiotic fungi that associate with roots of almost all living plants—may play an important role in maintaining this pool as well. Measurements of plant carbon allocation to mycorrhizal fungi have been estimated to be 5-20% of total plant carbon uptake,&lt;ref&gt;Pearson JN and Jakobsen I. 1993. The relative contribution of hyphae and roots to phosphorus uptake by arbuscular mycorrhizal plants, measured by dual labeling with 32P and 33P. New Phytologist, 124: 489-494.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hobbie JE and Hobbie EA. 2006. 15N in symbiotic fungi and plants estimates nitrogen and carbon flux rates in arctic tundra. Ecology, 87: 816-822&lt;/ref&gt; and in some ecosystems the [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of mycorrhizal fungi can be comparable to the biomass of fine roots.&lt;ref&gt;Wallander H, Goransson H and Rosengren U. Production, standing biomass and natural abundance of 15N and 13C in ectomycorrhizal mycelia collected at different soil depths in two forest types. Oecologia, 139: 89-97.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has shown that mycorrhizal fungi hold 50 to 70 percent of the total carbon stored in leaf litter and soil on forested islands in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;K.E. Clemmensen et al. 2013. Roots and associated fungi drive long-term carbon sequestration in boreal forest. Science, 339: 1615-1618.&lt;/ref&gt; Turnover of mycorrhizal biomass into the soil carbon pool is thought to be rapid&lt;ref&gt;Staddon et al. 2003. Rapid turnover of hyphae of mycorrhizal fungi determined by AMS microanalysis of 14C. Science, 300: 1138-1140.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been shown in some ecosystems to be the dominant pathway by which living carbon enters the soil carbon pool.&lt;ref&gt;Godbold DL et al. 2006. Mycorrhizal hyphal turnover as a dominant process for carbon input into soil organic matter. Plant and Soil, 281: 15-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outlined below are the leading lines of evidence on how different aspects of mycorrhizal fungi may alter soil carbon decomposition and storage. Evidence is presented for [[Arbuscular mycorrhiza|arbuscular]] and [[ectomycorrhiza]]l fungi separately as they are [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] distinct and often function in very different ways.

==Recalcitrance of mycorrhizal tissues==
Based on the magnitude of mycorrhizal fungal inputs to the soil carbon pool, some have suggested that variation in the [[recalcitrance]] of mycorrhizal biomass may be important for predicting soil carbon storage, as it would affect the rate at which the contribution of mycorrhizal fungi to soil carbon is returned to the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Langley JA and Hungate BA. 2003. Mycorrhizal controls on belowground litter quality. Ecology, 84: 2302-2312.&lt;/ref&gt; The compound [[glomalin]], produced only by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, has been found to accumulate in some soils, and may be a substantial fraction of the soil carbon pool in these ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Rillig et al. 2001. Large contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to soil carbon pools in tropical forest soils. Plant and Soil, 233: 167-177.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a recent set of experiments demonstrates the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi results in net losses of soil carbon,&lt;ref&gt;Cheng et al. 2012 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increase organic carbon decomposition under elevated CO2. Science, 337: 1084-1087.&lt;/ref&gt; calling into question the role of glomalin produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi leading to increased soil carbon storage.&lt;ref&gt;Verbruggen et al. 2013. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi – short-term liability but long-term benefits for soil carbon storage? New Phytologist, 197: 366-368.&lt;/ref&gt; Proteomic work has revealed that most of the proteins isolated in the glomalin extraction are not of mycorrhizal origin, and therefore the contribution of this molecule to soil C storage has likely been overestimated.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, Adam W., et al. "Glomalin-related soil protein contains non-mycorrhizal-related heat-stable proteins, lipids and humic materials." Soil Biology and Biochemistry 43.4 (2011): 766-777.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a similar line of argument, Langley and Hungate (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Langley JA and Hungate BA. 2003. Mycorrhizal controls on belowground litter quality. Ecology, 84: 2302-2312.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the abundance of [[chitin]] in ectomycorrhizal tissues may reduce decomposition rates of these fungi, under the assumption that chitin is recalcitrant. This possibility was tested and refuted recently. Fernandez and Koide (2012) show that chitin does not decompose more slowly than other chemical compounds in ectomycorrhizal tissues, and that chitin concentrations positively correlated with mycorrhizal biomass decomposition rates, rather than negatively.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez CW and Koide RT. 2012. The role of chitin in the decomposition of ectomycorrhizal fungal litter. Ecology, 93: 24-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on fine root decomposition==
Mycorrhizal fungi are nutrient rich structures compared to the roots they colonize, and it is possible that mycorrhizal colonization of roots leads to increased rates of root decomposition because decomposers would have greater access to nutrients. Evidence is equivocal on this point, as ectomycorrhizal colonization does increase fine root decomposition rates substantially compared to uncolonized roots in some ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;Koide RT, Fernandez CW and Peoples MS. 2011. Can ectomycorrhizal colonization of Pinus resinosa roots affect their decomposition? New Phytologist, 191: 508-514&lt;/ref&gt; while Pinus edulis roots colonized predominately by ectomycorrhizal fungi from the [[Ascomycota]] group have been found to decompose more slowly than uncolonized controls.&lt;ref&gt;Langley JA, Champman SK and Hungate BA. Ectomycorrhizal colonization slows root decomposition: the post-mortem fungal legacy. Ecology Letters, 9: 955-959&lt;/ref&gt;

In an experiment where the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization on plant decomposition was tested,&lt;ref&gt;Urcelay C, Vaieretti MV, Pérez M, Díaz S. 2011. Effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation on shoot and root decomposition of different plant species and species mixtures. Soil Biology and Biochemistry 43: 466–468&lt;/ref&gt; only aboveground plant material was found to have decomposed faster after 3 months while root decomposition remained unchanged, even though arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are confined to roots.

==Effects on soil aggregation==
Soil aggregation can physically protect organic carbon from decay by soil microbes.&lt;ref&gt;Jastrow, J.D., and R.M. Miller. 1998. Soil aggregate stabilization and carbon sequestration: Feedbacks through organomineral associations, pp. 207-223. In R. Lal, J.M. Kimble, R.F. Follett, and B.A. Stewart (eds.) Soil Processes and the Carbon Cycle. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, FL.&lt;/ref&gt; More aggregate formation can result in more soil carbon storage. There is much evidence that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increase soil aggregate formation, and that aggregate formation may be mediated by the arbuscular mycorrhizal protein [[glomalin]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Gail WT, et al. Soil aggregation and carbon sequestration are tightly correlated with the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi: results from long‐term field experiments. Ecology Letters 12.5 (2009): 452-461.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, even if glomalin itself is not exceptionally recalcitrant and chemically resistant to decomposition (as described above) it may still contribute to soil carbon storage by physically protecting other organic matter from decomposition by promoting soil aggregation. 
There is little information regarding the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in soil aggregate stability. There are anecdotal accounts of ectomycorrhizal fungi increasing aggregation in sand in-growth bags commonly used to trap these fungi,&lt;ref&gt;Wallander H, Nilsson LO, Hagerberg D and Baath E. 2001. Estimation of the biomass and seasonal growth of external mycelium of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the field. New Phytologist, 151: 753-760.&lt;/ref&gt; but no current evidence that they promote aggregate formation or stability in field soils.

==Stimulation of decomposition (priming)==
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have been shown to increase soil carbon decomposition in nutrient rich patches.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, Angela, Colin D. Campbell, and Alastair H. Fitter. 2001 An arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus accelerates decomposition and acquires nitrogen directly from organic material. Nature, 413: 297-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Since arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are thought to lack the ability to produce the enzymes to catalyze this decomposition&lt;ref&gt;Read DJ and Perez-Moreno J. 2003. Mycorrhizas and nutrient cycling in ecosystems – a journey towards relevance? New Phytologist, 157: 475-492&lt;/ref&gt; it is generally thought that they stimulate free-living decomposer communities to increase activity by exuding labile energy substrates, a process termed priming. Recent lab experiments have shown that the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increases losses of soil carbon compared to soils where arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are excluded, and that the difference is greater under elevated CO2 when the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is greater.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng et al. 2012 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increase organic carbon decomposition under elevated CO2. Science, 337: 1084-1087.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The evidence for ectomycorrhizal priming is so far inconclusive. Field evidence suggests that ectomycorrhizal fungi may be increasing the rate of soil carbon degradation,&lt;ref&gt;Phillips RP et al. 2012. Roots and fungi accelerate carbon and nitrogen cycling in forests exposed to elevated CO2. Ecology Letters, 15: 1042-1049.&lt;/ref&gt; however lab tests show that exudation from fine roots decreases with increasing ectomycorrhizal colonization,&lt;ref&gt;Meier, Ina C., Peter G. Avis, and Richard P. Phillips. Fungal communities influence root exudation rates in pine seedlings. FEMS microbiology ecology 83.3 (2013): 585-595.&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi should reduce priming effects. Brzostek et al. (2012) report variation in form of nitrogen produced in the rhizosphere of trees that vary in mycorrhizal type, however the effects of root and mycorrhizal priming could not be separated.&lt;ref&gt;Edward, R. Brzostek, Danilo Dragoni, and Richard P. Phillips. "Root carbon inputs to the rhizosphere stimulate extracellular enzyme activity and increase nitrogen availability in temperate forest soils." 97th ESA Annual Meeting. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inhibition of decomposition==
The first report of mycorrhizal inhibition of decomposition was in 1971 and came from ectomycorrhizal ''Pinus radiatia'' plantations in New Zealand. Authors show that excluding roots and mycorrhizal fungi resulted in net carbon loss, and that the result could not be explained by soil disturbance effects.&lt;ref&gt;Gadgil, Ruth L., and P. D. Gadgil. Mycorrhiza and litter decomposition. (1971): 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism presented is that ectomycorrhizal fungi can compete with free-living decomposers for nutrients, and thereby limit the rate of total decomposition. Since then there have been several other reports of ectomycorrhizal fungi reducing activity and decomposition rates of free-living decomposers and thereby increasing soil carbon storage.&lt;ref&gt;Berg B and Lindberg T. 1980. Is litter decomposition retarded in the presence of mycorrhizal roots in forest soil? Internal Report- Swedish Coniferous Forest Project, {{ISBN|91-7544-095-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindahl BD, de Boer W and Finlay RD. 2010. Disruption of root carbon transport into forest humus stimulates fungal opportunists at the expense of mycorrhizal fungi. The ISME Journal, 4: 872-881.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGuire KL et al. 2010. Slowed decomposition is biotically mediated in an ectomycorrhizal, tropical rain forest. Oecologia, 164: 785-795.&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical ecosystem model recently demonstrated that greater access to organic nitrogen by mycorrhizal fungi should slow decomposition of soil carbon by free-living decomposers by inducing nutrient limitation.&lt;ref&gt;Orwin KH et al. Organic nutrient uptake by mycorrhizal fungi enhances ecosystem carbon storage: a model based assessment. Ecology Letters, 14: 493-502.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted however, that Koide and Wu (2003) made a strong case that the effect of ectomycorrhizal fungi on reducing decomposition may have more to do with competition for soil water than soil nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Koide RT and Wu T. 2003. Ectomycorrhizas and retarded decomposition in a ''Pinus resinosa'' plantation. New Phytologist, 158: 401-407.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may be outcompeting free-living decomposers for either water or nutrients in some systems as well, however to date there is no demonstration of this, and it seems that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may more often increase, rather than decrease rates of decomposition by free-living microbial decomposers.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, Angela, Colin D. Campbell, and Alastair H. Fitter. 2001 An arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus accelerates decomposition and acquires nitrogen directly from organic material. Nature, 413: 297-299.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheng et al. 2012 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increase organic carbon decomposition under elevated CO2. Science, 337: 1084-1087.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''myelencephalon''' or '''afterbrain''' is the most posterior region of the embryonic hindbrain, from which the [[medulla oblongata]] develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/myelencephalon|title = Myelencephalon|date = 2011|accessdate = 2015-05-05|website = Segen's Medical Dictionary|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

=== Neural tube to myelencephalon ===
During fetal development, divisions of the [[neural tube]] that give rise to the hindbrain ([[rhombencephalon]]) and the other primary vesicles ([[forebrain]] and [[midbrain]]) occur at just 28 days after conception.  With the exception of the midbrain, these primary vesicles undergo further differentiation at 5 weeks after conception to form the myelencephalon and the other secondary vesicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Myelencephalon to medulla  ===
Final shape differentiation of the myelencephalon into the [[medulla oblongata]] can be observed at 20 weeks gestation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Carlson, Neil R. Foundations of Behavioral Neuroscience.63-65&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medulla oblongata ==
The [[medulla oblongata]] is part of the brain stem that serves as the connection of the spinal cord to the brain.  It is situated between the [[pons]] and the [[spinal cord]].  
[[File:Medulla oblongata small.gif|thumb|Medulla oblongata- animation]]

=== Function ===
The medulla oblongata is responsible for several functions of the [[autonomic nervous system]].  These functions include:&lt;ref&gt;Loewy, A. D., &amp; Spyer, K. M. (Eds.). (1990). Central regulation of autonomic functions. Oxford University Press, USA.145-164&lt;/ref&gt;

1) Respiration: monitors the acidity of the blood and sends electrical signals to intercostal muscle tissue to increase their contraction rate in order to oxygenate the blood as needed.

2) Cardiac &amp; Vasomotor Center:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cardiovascular Regulation |url = http://www.colorado.edu/MCEN/MCEN4228/index_files/cardio_lecture2.pdf|website = www.colorado.edu|accessdate = 2015-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; monitors and regulates cardiovascular activities by:
* Sympathetic excitation in order to increase cardiac output
* Parasympathetic inhibition of cardiac output
* Affecting blood pressure via [[vasodilation]] and [[vasoconstriction]]
3) Reflexes
* Coughing
* Sneezing
* Swallowing (palatal)
* Vomiting
* Gagging (pharyngeal)
* Jaw jerk (masseter)

=== Damage/trauma ===
Because of its location in the [[brainstem]] and its many important roles in the autonomic nervous system, damage to the medulla oblongata is usually fatal.

A '''naked butler '''is a popular type of entertainment used at [[Bachelorette party|hen parties]] and for corporate entertainment. It was introduced into the UK in the early 2000s and is now popular across the USA, New Zealand, Australia and Canada.

==Attire==

===Naked butler===
[[File:Naked butlers with a hen party, Bristol 2013.jpg|320px|thumbnail|right|Naked butlers serving guests at a hen party]]
The standard attire for a naked butler is only an [[apron]] or [[Trunks (clothing)|trunks]], [[cuff]]s, [[detachable collar]] and [[bow tie]]. It is seen as a more conservative entertainment option to hiring a [[male stripper]] for a [[Bachelorette party]] as it can be suitable for a broader range of guests.

===Topless waiter===

In this case the apron will be replaced with smart black trousers. This option may be more commonly used during corporate entertainment where the attire needs to be smarter and the exposing of a butlers naked bottom is not appropriate.

==In popular culture==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:A naked butler on X factor, July 2011.jpg|thumb|223x223px]] --&gt;
Naked butlers have become a popular [[gimmick]] on television shows in the UK and this is demonstrated by appearances on TV shows including ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'', ''[[Come Dine with Me]]'' and ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|the X Factor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/1806642/x-factor-half-naked-butlers-endless-booze-and-hot-tub-romps-what-really-happened-at-the-x-factor-contestants-party/|title=Boozy wannabes have X-rated romp in boot camp hot tub as  Simon warns some have blown their chances|date=2016-09-18|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2005, the role and job of a naked butler was discussed in the documentary ''Going to work Naked'' on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].&lt;ref&gt;Star 7th February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, naked butlers were part of an international news feature after being hired by a retirement home as part of the resident's wish program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/16988603.milton-lodges-hunks-in-trunks-visit-goes-international/|title=Care home's Hunks in Trunks visit goes international|website=Gazette|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Michael Chekhov Association (NMCA)''' is an accredited actor training and teacher certification program in the '''[[Michael Chekhov]] Acting Technique'''.

==Brief History==

The [http://www.chekhov.net/ '''National Michael Chekhov Association (NMCA)''']&lt;ref&gt;[[Mala Powers#National Michael Chekhov Association .28NMCA.29]]&lt;/ref&gt; began informally during the 1993 [[Association for Theatre in Higher Education]] (ATHE) conference at which the three founders, [[Mala Powers]], Chekhov Estate Executrix; [[Lisa Dalton (actor)]], American representative on the International Michael Chekhov Association's Board; and [http://usm.maine.edu/rscholar/william-kilroy Wil Kilroy], Professor, [[University of Southern Maine]], were presenting workshops on the Michael Chekhov Acting Technique.

Wil Kilroy initiated the Chekhov Theatre Institute in 1994 during the [[University of Southern Maine]] (USM) Summer Sessions. Several years later, the course was granted full graduate and undergraduate accreditation from the State of Maine Educational System. From 1994 through 2006, the three teachers team-taught the program at USM, initiating the first Michael Chekhov Teacher Certification Track globally.

In 2008 Charlie Bowles hosted the NMCA's summer training intensive in Arlington, TX. His involvement quickly escalated, becoming the Secretary and Treasurer on the NMCA Board. Charlie also acts as the Executive Producer of NMCA programming and was responsible for the creation the current NMCA training format and its sister publications.

==Program==

NMCA holds weeklong, 55-hour training intensives in various parts of the [[United States]] every year. Currently, the two main intensives are held in January at the [[University of Florida]] and in July at the [[University of Southern Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Educational Programs of NMCA, Inc.|url=http://chekhov.net/eduprograms.html|website=chekhov.net|publisher=chekhov.net|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actor Training===
Participants attend a weeklong intensive, learning the various tools of the technique while applying them to scene work, culminating in a final performance showcase.

===Teacher Certification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teacher Training Certificate Track|url=http://chekhov.net/teachertraining.html|website=chekhov.net|publisher=chekhov.net|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Participants attend two weeklong intensives, learning the various tools of the technique while applying them to scene work, culminating in a final performance. Toward the end of the course, the teacher candidate will lead the attending class in a selected tool, as well as, attend an additional day at the end the intensive to synthesize their understanding through discussion. Finally, the teacher candidate must complete and present an approved project that demonstrates their mastery of the technique and ability to effectively communicate its use to others.

'''Neuroconstructivism''' is a theory that states that [[gene]]–gene interaction, [[gene–environment interaction]] and, crucially, [[ontogeny]] all play a vital role in how the [[brain]] progressively sculpts itself and how it gradually becomes specialized over developmental time.

Supporters of neuroconstructivism, such as [[Annette Karmiloff-Smith]], argue against innate [[modularity of mind]], the notion that a brain is composed of innate neural structures or modules which have distinct [[evolution]]arily established functions. Instead, emphasis is put on innate domain relevant biases. These biases are understood as aiding learning and directing attention. Module-like structures are therefore the product of both experience and these innate biases. Neuroconstructivism can therefore be seen as a bridge between [[Jerry Fodor]]'s [[psychological nativism]] and [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[theory of cognitive development]].

==Development vs. innate modularity==

Neuroconstructivism has arisen as a direct rebuttal against psychologists who argue for an innate [[modularity]] of the [[brain]].&lt;ref name = "Fodor83"&gt;Fodor, J. (1983). ''The modularity of mind.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pinker94"&gt;Pinker, S. (1994). ''The language instinct.'' London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; Modularity of the brain would require a pre-specified pattern of synaptic connectivity within the [[Cerebral cortex|cortical microcircuitry]] of a specific neural system.&lt;ref name = "KS06"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karmiloff-Smith|first=A.| title= The tortuous route from genes to behavior: A neuroconstructivist approach |journal= Cognitive Affective &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience|volume=6|issue=1|pages=9–17|year=1997|pmid=16869225|doi=10.3758/cabn.6.1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, [[Annette Karmiloff-Smith]] has suggested that the microconnectivity of the brain emerges from the gradual process of ontogenetic development.&lt;ref name = "KS06" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "KS92"&gt;Karmiloff-Smith, A. (1992). ''Beyond modularity: A developmental perspective on cognitive science.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, Bradford Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "KS98"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karmiloff-Smith|first=A.|author2=Plunkett, K. |author3=Johnson, M. |author4=Elman, J.L. |author5=Bates, E. |title= What does it mean to claim that something is "innate"? |journal= Mind &amp; Language |volume=13|pages=588–597|year=1998| DOI=10.1111/1468-0017.00095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the [[Modularity of mind|modular theory]] might have been misled by the seemingly normal performances of individuals who exhibit a learning disability on tests. While it may appear that cognitive functioning may be impaired in only specified areas, this may be a functional flaw in the test. Many standardized tasks used to assess the extent of damage within the brain do not measure underlying causes, instead only showing the static end-state of complex processes.&lt;ref name = "Oliver00"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oliver|first=A.|author2=Johnson,M.H. |author3=Karmiloff-Smith, A. |author4=Pennington, B. | title= Deviations in the emergence of representations: a neuroconstructivist framework for analysing developmental disorders |journal= Developmental Science|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–40|year=2000|doi=10.1111/1467-7687.00094}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative explanation to account for these normal test scores would be the ability of the individual to compensate using other brain regions that are not normally used for such a task.&lt;ref name = "KS06" /&gt; Such compensation could only have resulted from developmental [[neuroplasticity]] and the interaction between environment and brain functioning.

Different functions within the brain arise through development. Instead of having prespecified patterns of connectivity, neuroconstructivism suggests that there are "tiny regional differences in type, density, and orientation of [[neurons]], in [[neurotransmitters]], in firing thresholds, in rate of [[myelination]], lamination, ratio of [[gray matter]] to [[white matter]]," etc. that led to differing capabilities of neurons or brain regions to handle specific functions.&lt;ref name = "KS09"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karmiloff-Smith|first=A.| title= Preaching to the converted? from constructivism to neuroconstructivism |journal= Child Development Perspectives |volume=3|issue=2|pages=99–102|year=2009| DOI=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2009.00086.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "KS12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karmiloff-Smith|first=A.| title= Challenging the use of adult neuropsychological models for explaining neurodevelopmental disorders: Developed versus developing brains |journal= The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=66|issue=1|pages=1–14|year=2012|pmid= 23173948|doi=10.1080/17470218.2012.744424}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Two-streams hypothesis|ventral]] and [[Two-streams hypothesis|dorsal]] streams only arise because of innate differences in processing speed of neurons, not an innate selection to be either ventral or dorsal by the respective neurons.&lt;ref name = "KS09" /&gt; Such a differentiation has been entitled a domain-relevant approach to development.&lt;ref name = "KS09" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "KS12" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "KS09,2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karmiloff-Smith|first=A.| title= Nativism versus neuroconstructivism: Rethinking the study of developmental disorders |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=45|issue=1|pages=56–63|year=2009| pmid= 19209990|doi=10.1037/a0014506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This contrasts the previous [[Domain-general learning|domain-general]] and [[Domain-specific learning|domain-specific]] approaches. In the domain-general framework, differences in cognitive functioning are attributed to overarching differences in the neurons across the entire brain. The domain-specific approach in contrast argues for inherent, specific differences within the [[genes]] which directly control a person's development. While it cannot rule out domain-specificity,&lt;ref name = "KS09,2" /&gt; neuroconstructivism instead offers a developmental approach that focuses on change and emergent outcomes.&lt;ref name = "KS09,2" /&gt; Such change leads to domain-specificity in adult brains, but neuroconstructivism argues that the key component of the specificity occurred from the domain-general start state.&lt;ref name = "KS06" /&gt;

Every aspect of development is dynamic and interactive.&lt;ref name = "KS09,2" /&gt; Human intelligence may be more accurately defined by focusing on the plasticity of the brain and its interactions with the environment rather than inherent differences within the [[DNA]] structure. Dissociations seen in [[Williams syndrome]] or [[autism]] provide neuroscientists with a means of exploring different developmental trajectories.&lt;ref name = "KS06" /&gt;

==Context dependence==

Neuroconstructivism uses context to demonstrate the possible changes to the [[brain]]'s neural connections. Starting with [[genes]] and incorporating progressively more context indicates some of the constraints involved in development. Instead of viewing the brain as independent of its current or previous environment, neuroconstructivism shows how context interacts with the brain to gradually form the specialized adult brain. In fact, by being building on preexisting representations, representations become increasingly context bound (rather than context free).&lt;ref name = "Mareschal11"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mareschal|first=D.| title= From NEOconstructivism to NEUROconstructivism |journal= Child Development Perspectives |volume=5|issue=3|pages=169–170|year=2011| doi= 10.1111/j.1750-8606.2011.00185.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to "restrictions of fate" in which later learning is more restricted than earlier learning.&lt;ref name = "Mareschal11" /&gt;

===Genes===

Previous theories have supposed that [[genes]] are static unchanging code for specific developmental outcomes. However, new research suggests that genes may be triggered by both environmental and behavioral influences.&lt;ref name = "West07"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Westermann|first=G.|author2=Mareschal, D. |author3=Johnson, M. H. |author4=Sirois, S. |author5=Spratling, M. W. |author6=Thomas, M. S. C.  |title= Neuroconstructivism |journal= Developmental Science |volume=10|issue=1|pages=75–83|year=2007| pmid=17181703 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00567.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Epigenetic theory|''probabilistic epigenesis'']] view of development&lt;ref&gt;Gottlieb, G. (1992). ''Individual development and evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that instead of following a predetermined path to expression, genes are modified by the behavior and environment of an organism. Furthermore, these modifications can then act on the environment, creating a causal circle in which genes influencing the environment are re-influenced by these changes in the environment.

===Encellment===

[[Cell (biology)|Cells]] do not develop in isolation. Even from a young age, [[neurons]] are influenced by the surrounding environment (e.g. other neurons).&lt;ref&gt;Jessell, T.M., &amp; Sanes, J.R. (2000). The induction and patterning of the nervous system. In E.R. Kandel, J.H. Schwartz, &amp; T.M. Jessell (Eds.), ''Principles of neural science'' (4th edn., pp. 1019-1040). New York and London: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, neurons interact either spontaneously or in response to some sensory stimulation to form neural networks.&lt;ref name = "West07" /&gt; Competition between neurons plays a key role in establishing the exact pattern of connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stryker|first=M.P.|author2=Strickland, S.L.|title= Physiological segregation of ocular dominance columns depends on the pattern of afferent electrical activity |journal= Ophthalmological Visual Science (Suppl).|volume=25|issue=6|pages=727–788|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, specific neural activation patterns may arise due to the underlying morphology and connection patterns within the specified neural structures. These may subsequently be modified by morphological change imposed by the current representations. Progressively more complex patterns may arise through manipulation of current neuronal structures by an organism's experience.&lt;ref name = "West07" /&gt;

===Enbrainment===

While [[neurons]] are embedded within networks, these networks are further embedded within the [[brain]] as a whole. Neural networks do not work in isolation, such as in the [[modularity of mind]] perspective. Instead, different regions interact through feedback processes and [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] interactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friston|first=K.J.|author2=Price, C.J.|title= Dynamic representations and generative models of brain function |journal= Brain Research Bulletin |volume=54|issue=3|pages=275–85|year=2001|pmid= 11287132|doi=10.1016/s0361-9230(00)00436-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; constraining and specifying the development of each region. For example, the primary [[visual cortex]] in blind individuals has been shown to process [[somatosensory system|tactile]] information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sadato|first=N.|author2= Pascual-Leone, A.|author3= Grafman, J.|author4=Ibanez, V.|author5=Deiber, M.-P.
|author6=Dold, G.|author7=Gallett, M.|lastauthoramp=y|title= Activation of the primary visual cortex by braille reading in blind subjects |journal= Nature |volume=380| pages=526–528|year=1996|pmid= 8606771|doi=10.1038/380526a0|issue=6574}}&lt;/ref&gt; The function of cortical areas emerges as a result of this sensory input and competition for cortical space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=M.H.| title= Functional brain development in infants: elements of an interactive specialization framework |journal= Child Development |volume=71|issue=1|pages=75–81|year=2000|pmid= 10836560|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00120}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This [[interactive specialization]] view implies that cortical regions might initially be non-specific in their responses but gradually narrow their responses as their functional specialization restricts them to a narrower set of circumstances."&lt;ref name = "West07" /&gt;

===Enbodiment===
{{See also|Embodied cognition|Embodied embedded cognition}}

The [[brain]] is further limited by its constraint within the body. The brain receives input from receptors on the body (e.g., [[somatosensory system]], [[visual system]], [[auditory system]], etc.). These receptors provide the brain with a source of information. As a result, they manipulate the brain's neural activation patterns, and thus its structure, leading to constraining effects on the construction of representations in the mind. The sensory systems limit the possible information the brain can receive and therefore act as a filter.&lt;ref name = "West07" /&gt; However, the brain may also interact with the environment through manipulation of the body (e.g., movement, changes in attention, etc.), thus manipulating the environment and the subsequent information received. Pro-activity while exploring the environment leads to altered experiences and consequently altered cognitive development.&lt;ref name = "West07" /&gt;

===Ensocialment===
{{See also|Social cognition|Social neuroscience}}

While a person may manipulate the environment, the specific environment in which the person develops has highly constraining effects on the possible neural representations exhibited through a restriction of the possible physical and social experiences.&lt;ref name = "West07" /&gt; For example, if a child is raised without a mother, the child cannot change his/her responses or actions to generate a mother. S/he may only work within the specified constraints of the environment in which s/he is born.

===The nature of representations===

All of the above constraints interact to form cognitive representations in the brain. The main principle is context dependence, as shaping occurs through competition and cooperation.&lt;ref name = "West07" /&gt; Competition leads to the specialization of developing components which then forms new representations. Cooperation, on the other hand, leads to combinations of existing mental representations that allow existing knowledge to be reused. Construction of representations also depends on the exploration of the environment by the individual. However, the experiences derived from this pro-activity constrain the range of possible adaptations within the mental representations.&lt;ref name = "West07" /&gt; Such [[Jean Piaget|progressive specialization]] arises from the constraints of the past and current learning environment. To alter representations, the environment demands improvements through small additions to the current mental state. This leads to partial&lt;ref name = "West07" /&gt; instead of fixed representations that are assumed to occur in adults. Neuroconstructivism argues such end products do not exist. The brain's plasticity leads to ever-changing mental representations through individual proactivity and environmental interactions. Such a viewpoint implies that any current mental representations are the optimal outcome for a specified environment. For example, in developmental disorders like [[autism]], atypical development arises because of adaptations to multiple interacting constraints, the same as normal development. However, the constraints differ and thus result in a different end-product. This view directly contrasts previous theories which assumed that disorders arise from isolated failures of particular functional modules.&lt;ref name = "West07" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6159">The '''Oxyrhynchus Gospels''' are two fragmentary [[manuscript]]s discovered among the rich finds of discarded [[papyri]] at [[Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt. Unknown to most laymen, they throw light on early [[non-canonical]] [[Gospel]] traditions.

==Oxyrhynchus 840==
'''Oxyrhynchus 840''' (P. Oxy. V 840), found in 1905, is a single small [[vellum parchment]] leaf with 45 lines of text written on both sides in a tiny neat hand that dates it to the 4th century, almost square, less than 10&amp;nbsp;cm across. It is kept at the [[Bodleian Library]], MS. Gr. th. g. 11 (P).&lt;ref name="bodl"&gt;{{cite web|title=MSS. Greek theology (Gr. th.)|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/medieval/greek/gr-th.html|publisher=[[Bodleian Library]]|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text probably predates 200, but no more is determinable from this evidence. In his introduction in ''The Complete Gospels'', [[Philip Sellew]] notes that this fragment was likely a [[amulet|talisman]] text, kept as an [[amulet]], perhaps worn around the neck. [[Michael J. Kruger]] who did his PhD dissertation on this fragment &lt;ref&gt;[[Larry Hurtado]], Lord Jesus Christ, Eerdman Publishing 2003, p 439, footnote 40&lt;/ref&gt; concludes that this could not be an amulet but rather a miniature [[codex]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael J Kruger, [[Journal of Theological Studies]] 53 (2003), p 93&lt;/ref&gt; The text itself has been dated to the first half of the second century. Sellew calls it "similar to the New Testament gospels in its style and tone."

The fragment begins with the end of a warning to an evildoer who plans ahead, yet fails to take the next life into account. There follows sections of a narrative unparalleled in any other known gospel tradition, about Jesus' encounter with "a Pharisee, a leading priest" who tries to order Jesus and the disciples out of the Temple as ritually unclean. Jesus responds by contrasting ritual cleanliness, gotten by bathing with water used by dogs and pigs, like a harlot, against the life-giving water that comes down from heaven in baptism.

Jesus is called "[[wiktionary:Savior|Savior]]" ({{lang-el|Σωτήρ}}), which is rare in the New Testament, but not unparalleled.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Luke'' 1:69, 2:11; ''John'' 4:42; ''Acts'' 5:31, 13:23&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the fragment also believes that laymen have to change their clothes to enter the temple, for which there is no other evidence. The author is distinctly hostile to Judaism, but as he knows little about it, the text is presumably not from Judea; the author's vague grasp of details of [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] rituals have suggested a [[Johannine]] circle, perhaps in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Sellew's note to 2:2; for Syria, see [http://www.maplenet.net/~trowbridge/oxy840.htm Geoff Trowbridge, "The Oxyrhynchus 840 Gospel"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oxyrhynchus 1224==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Jesus Seminar]] --&gt;
'''Oxyrhynchus 1224''' (P. Oxy. X 1224), now at the [[Bodleian Library]], MS. Gr. th. e. 8 (P),&lt;ref name="bodl" /&gt; consists of two small [[papyrus]] fragments from the late 3rd or early 4th century. It contains six passages, each about a sentence. Two of the longer ones are parallel to Mark 2:17 and Luke 9:50, but the differences in phrasing show they are textually independent of the Gospels. A precise date for composition is unknown; 50 is possible,&lt;ref&gt;Miller's introduction, ''Complete Gospels'', p.416, and notes to fragments 5 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt; though a date of around 150 AD. is more widely accepted by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Craig A. Evans, Ph.D., Fabricating Jesus: How Modern Scholars Distort the Gospels, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dominic Crossan]] notes the mutilated condition in his introduction to the fragmentary text in ''The Complete Gospels'' resulting in highly conjectural reconstructions of the text, which, however, "does not seem to be dependent on the New Testament gospels.... As an independent gospel, it belongs, insofar as its fragmentary state allows us to see, not with discourse gospels involving the risen Jesus (e.g., the ''[[Secret Book of James]]'' and the ''[[Gospel of Mary]]''), but with sayings gospels involving the earthly Jesus (e.g., [[Q document]] and the ''[[Gospel of Thomas]]''). Crossan suggests that the document might have been written as early as the mid-first century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7453">'''Parallelism''' is a rhetorical device that compounds words or phrases that have equivalent meanings so as to create a definite pattern. This structure is particularly effective when "specifying or enumerating pairs or series of like things".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; A scheme of balance, parallelism represents "one of the basic principles of grammar and rhetoric".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallelism as a [[rhetorical device]] is used in many languages and cultures around the world in poetry, epics, songs, written prose and speech, from the folk level to the professional. It is very often found in Biblical poetry and in proverbs in general. 

==Examples==

The following sentences and verses possess "similarity in structure" in words and phrases:

{{quote |''She tried to make the law clear, precise and equitable.''&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;}}

In the quote above, the compounded adjectives serve as parallel elements and support the noun "law".

{{quote |''Her purpose was to impress the ignorant, to perplex the dubious, and to confound the scrupulous.''&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}

In the above quote, three prepositional phrases produce the parallel structure supporting the noun "purpose". Note that this rhetorical device requires that the coordinate elements agree with one another grammatically: "nouns with nouns, prepositional phrases with prepositional phrases and adverb clauses with adverb clauses."&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the coordinate elements possess that same number of words (or in the example below, the same number of syllables) the scheme is termed [[Isocolon|isocolon]]:

{{quote |''I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,&lt;br/&gt;My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,&lt;br/&gt;My gay apparel for an almsman's gown&lt;br/&gt;My figured goblets for a dish of wood.''&lt;br/&gt;

 – [[William Shakespeare|Shakepeare]], [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]&lt;ref&gt; Baldick,2008. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Forms of parallelism==
Parallelisms of various sorts are the chief [[rhetoric]]al device of [[Biblical poetry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Parallelism}} [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11473a.htm Online version of article].&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Tristich]] and in multiples of [[Distich]] parallels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11902-parallelism-in-hebrew-poetry | title=PARALLELISM IN HEBREW POETRY | publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com | accessdate=December 7, 2011 | author=Casanowicz, I. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the poetry of many other cultures around the world, particularly in their oral traditions.&lt;ref&gt;p. 216. James J. Fox. 1971. Semantic Parallelism in Rotinese Ritual Language. ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' Deel 127, 2de Afl., pp. 215-255.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Lowth]] coined the term ''parallelismus membrorum'' (parallelism of members, i.e. poetic lines) in his 1788 book, ''Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrew Nation''. [[Roman Jakobson]] pioneered the secular study of parallelism in poetic-linguistic traditions around the world, including his own Russian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, Roman. 1987. "The Poetry of Grammar and the Grammar of Poetry." In Language in Literature. K. Pomorska and S. Rudy, eds. Pp. 121-144. Cambridge, MA: The Belnap Press of Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chinese and Vietnamese classical poetry and prose have frequently made use of parallelism. Conversations between learned men in many cases involved exchanging single [[:zh:对偶|parallel couplets]] as a form of playing with words, as well as a kind of mental duel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ann Huss|first1=Ann|last2=Liu|first2=Jianmei|title=The Jin Yong Phenomenon: Chinese Martial Arts Fiction and Modern Chinese Literary History|date=2007|publisher=Cambria Press|isbn=9781934043080|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2j5o95IZZAMC&amp;pg=PA223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nguyen|first1=Tai Thu|title=The History of Buddhism in Vietnam|date=2008|publisher=CRVP|isbn=9781565180987|page=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUN8tC0ftJcC&amp;pg=PA200}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a parallel couplet, not only must the content, the parts of speech, the mythological and historico-geographical allusions, be all separately matched and balanced, but most of the tones must also be paired reciprocally. Even tones are conjoined with inflected ones, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinavista.com/culture/letters/poetry/home.html Chinese Poetic Literature] ChinaVista, 1996-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallelisms in artistic speech are common in some languages of Mesoamerica, such as [[Nahuatl]] (Aztec).&lt;ref&gt;William Bright. 1990. "With one lip, with two lips": Parallelism in Nahuatl. ''Language'' 66.3:437-452.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been observed in a language of Indonesia (that Fox imprecisely referred to as "Rotinese")&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James J. Fox. 1971. Semantic Parallelism in Rotinese Ritual Language. ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' Deel 127, 2de Afl., pp. 215-255.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Navajo language|Navajo]].&lt;ref&gt;Coyote Poems: Navajo Poetry, Intertextuality, and Language Choice. Anthony K. Webster. 2004. Coyote Poems: Navajo Poetry, Intertextuality, and Language Choice. ''American Indian Culture and Research Journal'' 28.4:69-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found parallelisms in the languages of the Ural-Altaic area (including Finnish-Karelian folk poetry and the epics and songs of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples) and [[Toda language|Toda]], suggesting wider distribution among Dravidian languages.&lt;ref name="James" /&gt;

== In proverbs ==
Parallelisms in [[Proverb|proverbs]] are very common in languages around the world. Parallel structures in short passages such as proverbs help direct the listener or reader to compare the parallel elements and thereby more easily deduce the point. 
*''Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.'' ([[English language|English]] proverb)
*''Wounds caused by knives will heal, wounds caused by words will not heal.'' ([[Mongolian culture|Mongolian]] proverb)
*''The truth has legs and ran away; the lie has no legs and must stay.'' ([[Yiddish culture|Yiddish]] proverb)
*''When there is food in the house, what matter if a guest arrives? When there is faith, what is death?'' ([[Afghan proverbs|Pashto proverb]])&lt;ref&gt;p. 181. Bartlotti, Leonard and Raj Wali Shah Khattak. 2006. ''Rohi Mataluna'', revised and expanded ed. Peshawar, Pakistan: Interlit and Pashto Academy, Peshawar University.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The cow which leaves first will be broken at the horn; the cow which remains in the back will be broken at the tail.'' ([[Alaba-K’abeena language|Alaaba proverb]] from Ethiopia)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4729">[[Plant]] [[root]] systems can grow to be complex due to a variety of [[species]] and [[microorganism]]s existing in a common [[soil]]. Plants have adapted to respond to the soil conditions and presence of [[microorganism|microbes]] through various mechanisms, one of which is the [[secretion]] of root [[exudate]]s. This secretion allows plants to largely influence the [[rhizosphere]] as well as the organisms that exist within it. The contents of exudates and the amount of substance released is reliant on multiple factors, including the root system architecture,&lt;ref name=Badri &gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.01926.x | title = Regulation and function of root exudates | journal = Plant, Cell &amp; Environment | volume = 32 | issue = 6 | pages = 666 | year = 2009 | last1 = Badri | first1 = Dayakar V | last2 = Vivanco | first2 = Jorge M }}&lt;/ref&gt; presence of harmful microbes, and [[metal toxicity]]. The species&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.arplant.57.032905.105159 | pmid = 16669762 | title = The Role of Root Exudates in Rhizosphere Interactions with Plants and Other Organisms | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 57 | pages = 233–66 | year = 2006 | last1 = Bais | first1 = Harsh P | last2 = Weir | first2 = Tiffany L | last3 = Perry | first3 = Laura G | last4 = Gilroy | first4 = Simon | last5 = Vivanco | first5 = Jorge M }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the plant as well as its developmental stage can also influence the chemical mixture that is released through exudates. The contents may include [[ion]]s, [[compounds of carbon|carbon-based compound]]s, [[amino acid]]s, [[sterol]]s, and many other chemical compounds. At sufficient [[concentration]]s, exudates are capable of mediating{{clarify|date=June 2018}} both positive and negative plant-plant&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and plant-microbe interactions.

The physiological mechanism by which exudates are released is not entirely understood and varies depending on the [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] as well as the contents of the secreted exudate. Various types of root cells&lt;ref name=Badri/&gt; have been suggested to sense microbes or compounds in the soil and secrete exudates accordingly. One example of root exudation occurs when plants sense [[elicitor]]s and prime{{clarify|date=June 2018}} for a stress or defense response.{{clarify|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref name=Badri/&gt; It is believed that elicitors, such as methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid, are sensed by receptors on root cap cells, often referred to as border cells.&lt;ref name=Badri/&gt; This induces a change in [[regulation of gene expression|gene regulation]], up-regulating specific defense or stress-response genes. This differential [[gene expression]] results in [[metabolism|metabolic]] changes that ultimately result in the [[biosynthesis]] of primary and secondary metabolites. These metabolites exit cells in the form of exudates through [[transport protein|transporters]] that vary depending on the chemical structure of the metabolites.&lt;ref name=Badri/&gt; The exudate secretion is then able to elicit a defense response against harmful microbes within the soil.

A specific experiment explored the role of root exudates in [[kin recognition]] in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. The researchers grew young [[seedling]]s in liquid media that contained exudates from either themselves, [[sibling]]s, or non-siblings.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2881236| year = 2010| author1 = Biedrzycki| first1 = M. L| title = Root exudates mediate kin recognition in plants| journal = Communicative &amp; Integrative Biology| volume = 3| issue = 1| pages = 28–35| last2 = Jilany| first2 = T. A| last3 = Dudley| first3 = S. A| last4 = Bais| first4 = H. P}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then assessed root length as well as the number of [[lateral roots]] that the seedlings produced in the different treatment groups. They found that ''Arabidopsis'' seedlings grown in non-sibling exudates produced more lateral roots compared to those grown in exudates of kin or self-origin.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Additionally, roots appeared to grow shorter when grown in non-sibling exudates. These results suggest that the ''Arabidopsis'' seedlings were capable of [[detection|detecting]] the exudates around them and responding accordingly.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Researchers speculate that this ability may be beneficial for fitness, allowing plants to allocate fewer resources to competition when grown amongst kin. 
	
While there is a legitimate current understanding of root exudates, further research and experimentation is still necessary to fully understand these mechanisms and how they may differ depending on the contents of exudates.

'''Primary Care Service Areas''' are geographic areas that are self-sufficient markets of [[primary care]]. These areas are designed in a manner such that the majority of patients living in these areas use primary care services form within the area. This ensures that any [[geographic targeting]] of policies and resources reach the patients they are meant for. These geographies have been created in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mazumdar | first1 = S. | last2 = Feng| first2 = X. | last3 = Konings| first3 = P. | last4 = McRae | first4 = I. | last5 = Girosi | first5 = F. |year = 2014 | title = A brief report on Primary Care Service Area catchment geographies in New South Wales Australia.| url = https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-072X-13-38| journal = International Journal of Health Geographics| volume = 13 | issue =38 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1186/1476-072X-13-38}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = D. | last2 = Mick| first2 = S. | last3 = Bott | first3 = D. | last4 = Stukel | first4 = T. | last5 = Chang | first5 = CH. | last6 = Marth | first6 = N. | last7 = Boag | first7 = J. | last8 = Carretta | first8 = HJ. |year = 2003 | title = Primary care service areas: a new tool for the evaluation of primary care services.| pmid = 12650392 | journal = Health Serv Res| volume = 38 | issue =1 | pages = 287–309 | doi = 10.1111/1475-6773.00116 | pmc=1360885}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Switzerland &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Busato | first1 = A. | last2 = Kunzi| first2 = B.|year = 2008 | title = Primary care physician supply and other key determinants of health care utilisation: the case of Switzerland.| url = http://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6963-8-8 | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 8 | issue =1 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-8-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using [[big data]] and [[Geographic information systems]].

Thus for example the Health Resources and Services Administration uses them to designate areas of workforce shortage. Primary Care Service Areas are thus for example an appropriate geography for measuring  primary care [[physician supply]] or geographic access to [[General practitioners]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2060">The '''rhythm band''' is one of the primary methods of introducing children to playing music.  Children are given [[maracas]], [[tambourine]]s, [[Bell (instrument)|bell]]s, [[claves|rhythm sticks]] and other [[idiophone]]s with which to beat out a simple [[rhythm]] while the teacher plays a song, usually on the [[piano]]. Alternatively, the teacher does not play a melody but also a rhythm instrument, so that only rhythms are played. Children can also make a rhythm band "just for fun" for themselves, without a teacher.

[[File:Rhythmband.ogg|thumb|An ear-deafening loud rhythm band with very loud rhythm instruments and noisemakers]]
If the participants like very loud music, [[noisemaker]]s like the [[pea whistle]], the [[Recorder_(educational_uses)#Unconventional_uses|recorder head joint]], the [[vuvuzela]] or the [[ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]] can be included into the rhythm band, as well as other very loud rhythm instruments like the [[snare drum]].

Rhythm bands are usually found in [[nursery school]]s or [[kindergarten]]s, but of course children also can make a rhythm band at home. Melodic instruments are introduced to the children in the first or second year of regular school. But in principle, a rhythm band can be made in every age, with more difficult rhrythms if the participants are older.

It is not uncommon for adult musical organizations to employ numerous rhythm players,  as in [[Latin American music]], or to distribute rhythm instruments for audience members to accompany a live performance.

[[File:Single RCBR module.JPG|thumb|A single RCBR module]]

The '''rotating cell biofilm reactor (RCBR)''' is a new type of biological process based on [[biofilm]] active sludge used in [[Wastewater treatment|wastewaters treatment]]. RCBR reactors represent an evolution of [[rotating biological contactors]] plants: in fact, they are able to develop about ten times the biological surface of rotating biological contactors plants, considering the same biological reactors volume (made of the set of disks). Such a result is obtained using – instead of a set of disks fixed on the central structured tree – many tridimensional plastic elements as carriers. These carriers are used to furnish the necessary biological surface for the cohesion of the bacterial film, responsible of the depuration process. These plastic elements are contained in a cilindric permeable cell, which is like the shape of the reactor cell of a traditional rotating RBC plant. One of the main peculiarity of the RCBR plant is represented by the fact that the biological carriers are common recycled water bottle plastic caps.

The intrinsic message of this technology is obvious: ''“transform a waste into a resource for the environment”''.

After a first settling and/or screening treatment, wastewaters to be treated (civil, industrial, domestic) are pumped into RCBR modules. By the wastewaters contact, plastic caps are covered by a bacterial biological film. Bacteria are nourished by the organic substance dissolved into the water, purifying it. Purified waters can be drained on a surface body water or on the ground. If they are conveniently disinfected and complementing the modules with a tertiary depuration plant, these waters can be used to irrigate, to full the toilets, to wash objects and streets.

[[File:RCBR core component.JPG|thumb|RCBR rotating cell containing bacterial carriers]]

== Functioning ==
A stainless steel cell, full of plastic caps of different dimension, slowly rotates (1–3 rpm) partially submerged inside a tank, where there are wastewaters to be purified. Plastic caps spontaneously form a bacterial film that progressively presents, at first, [[Heterotrophic microorganism|heterotrophic]] bacteria development which are able to nourish of organic carbon pollutants; then the decrease of [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] and [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] concentration and then the development of [[Autotrophic nutrition|autotrophic]] bacteria. They belong to the [[nitrosomonas]] and [[nitrobacter]] category and they are able to oxidize ammonium, transforming it into [[nitrites]] and [[nitrates]].
The cell containing the carriers (caps) can be flooded as needed; in this way the depuration process control is obtained and it can be oriented both to the carbon removal both to the wastewaters [[denitrification]]. These plants, like happening for the biological disks, do not need any blower for the bacteria film oxygenation. It's the slow reactor rotation – alternatively submerged into sewage and into atmosphere – to guarantee the adequate oxygen supply for the oxidation aerobically of the sewage made by the biological film attached to the carriers. In this way it is possible to obtain a huge reduction of functioning and operating treatment costs.

[[File:Combined RCBR Modules.JPG|thumb|Two combined RCBR modules]]

== Configuration ==
RCBR technology is an entirely water biological treatment system, able to make more compact and efficient the biology of any wastewaters treatment plant. For the depuration of urban wastewaters it is placed downline of primary treatments (screening, oil separation, degritting, primary settling) and upline of water physical or chemical disinfection tertiary treatments (ultraviolets, ozone). This system offers the chance to realize into restrained spaces a huge surface of cohesion for the bacteria colonies, which are active for the depuration; this aspect makes it particularly suitable also for the nitrogen removal from wastewaters, in nitro-denitro configuration. Matching a series of more modules, some of them totally submerged by the wastewaters (in anoxic conditions) operate as denitrification stadium. Others, only partially submerged into the wastewaters, in presence of oxygen, operate the carbon removal and, at the same time, the ammonium [[nitrification]]. The system simplicity and the efficiency demonstrated in the tearing down also high elevations of suspended solid and organic carbon, make it usable as a pre-treatment, upline of drinkable systems of superficial and underground polluted waters (rivers, drains, stratum, ponds and temporary puddles of rain water).

== Consumption and maintenance ==
This biofilm system does not need any blower to oxygenate the bacteria colonies. It's the simple cell rotation to produce the oxygenation by simple diffusion. The energetic costs of this technology are really cheap and they are related only to the rotational movement impressed by an electric engine to the reaction cell, to maintain the device in a slow movement. The application of RCBR technology generally gets a reduction of the 90% of the water treatment electrical costs, with a medium consumption of 0.25 kWh per cubic meter of purified water.
RCBR's low consumption makes very easy to match these plants with renewable energy, like photovoltaic or aeolian plants. RCBR devices'  mechanical plant does not need any important operations of routine maintenance or any specialized technical expertise to control their operation. In fact, just the common greasing of the cell supporting rotation is requested.

== The invention ==
RCBR is an invention of Italian chemist Sergio Modenese. The first patent of the RCBR technology was registered in July 2013, by an innovative startup from Trentino Alto Adige, of whom the inventor is one of the founder partners.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

The '''Sanchi Yakshi Figure''' is a sandstone statue of the [[Shalabhanjika]] [[Yakshi]] from the ancient Buddhist site of [[Sanchi]] in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]], India. One of the earliest Buddhist sculptures from the [[Indian subcontinent]], it has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection since 1842.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=226080&amp;partId=1&amp;place=40492&amp;plaA=40492-3-2&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/s/sandstone_figure_of_shalabhanj.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
The bejewelled figure of the [[yakshi]] was originally installed on one of the gateways that surrounded the Great [[Stupa]] at Sanchi, which is said to have contained the relics of the [[Buddha]]. In the 1st century AD four [[torana]]s or large gateways were erected around the stupa, which served as the main entrances to a circular processional walkway that surrounded the holy building. Made of [[sandstone]], the gateways were elaborately decorated with some of the earliest surviving forms of buddhist [[iconography]]. The beam of the western gateway was originally supported by this bracket figure.  During the preliminary excavations at the site in the early nineteenth century, it came into the possession of a Mrs Tucker, who donated it to the British Museum in 1842. One of the few figures from the site in the [[Western World|West]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/torso-of-a-fertility-goddess-yakshi-from-the-great-stupa-at-sanchi-17530 The Boston Museum of Fine Arts has another Sanchi figure]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.lacma.org/node/250015 The Los Angeles County Museum of Art has two similar figures]&lt;/ref&gt; it remains one of the most important early [[Buddhist]] sculptures in the museum's collection.

[[File:Northern Gate, Sanchi Stupa built in 3rd century BC.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Detail of the northern gate at Sanchi, with similar yakshi brackets below the upper and middle beams.]]

==Description==
Carved in white sandstone, the almost nude figure of the yakshi figure is shown clasping onto the branches of a tree with her arms, with her right leg wrapped around its [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]]. She is weighed down with ornate [[jewellery]] around her neck, waist and ankles. The sculpture also acted as an [[architectural]] bracket, supporting a long sandstone [[Beam (structure)|beam]] that once ran above the yakshi's head. The [[Shalabhanjika]] Yakshi thus served two purposes: as a fertility [[symbol]] associated with the vitality of the fruit-bearing tree and as a structural element supporting the whole configuration of the gateway.

'''Savage Love''' is a syndicated sex-[[advice column]] by [[Dan Savage]]. The column appears weekly in several dozen newspapers, mainly free newspapers in the US and Canada, but also newspapers in Europe and Asia. It started in 1991 with the first issue of the [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] weekly newspaper ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]''.

Since October 2006, Savage has also recorded the ''Savage Lovecast'', a weekly [[podcast]] version of the column, featuring telephone advice sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://podcasts.thestranger.com/savagelove/archives.php#a029910 |title=Dan Savage |publisher=Podcasts.thestranger.com |accessdate=March 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206090407/http://podcasts.thestranger.com/savagelove/archives.php#a029910 |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Podcasts are released every Tuesday.

Since 2002, he has written the column at [[Eppie Lederer]]'s desk, which he, a "lifelong fan" of her [[Ann Landers]] column, bought at auction after the noted advice columnist died.&lt;ref name="savage desk"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=12738 |title=Ann Advises On |date=December 5, 2002 |first=Dan |last=Savage |newspaper=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |accessdate=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1991, Savage was living in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], and working as a manager at a local video store that specialized in independent film titles.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/savage_d.html |title=GLBTQ Literature: Dan Savage |publisher=GLBTQ.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604104320/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/savage_d.html |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he befriended Tim Keck, co-founder of ''[[The Onion]]'', who announced that he was moving to [[Seattle]] to help start an alternative weekly newspaper titled ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]''.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Bio" /&gt; Savage "made the offhand comment that forever altered [his] life: 'Make sure your paper has an advice column – everybody claims to hate 'em, but everybody seems to read 'em'."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, Introduction, ''Savage Love: Straight Answers from America's Most Popular Sex Columnist'' (New York: Plume, 1998), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He typed up a sample column, and to his surprise Keck offered him the job.&lt;ref name=AV-club&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/45150 Dan Savage interviewed by Tasha Robinson], ''The A.V. Club'', February 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, Introduction, ''Savage Love: Straight Answers from America's Most Popular Sex Columnist'', op. cit., pp. 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage stated in a February 2006 interview in ''The Onion''{{'}}s ''[[The A.V. Club|A.V. Club]]'' (which publishes his column) that he began the column with the express purpose of providing mocking advice to heterosexuals, since most straight advice columnists were "clueless" when responding to letters from gay people.&lt;ref name=AV-club /&gt;

== Language ==
=== Recapture of offensive words ===
For the first six years of the column, Savage had his readers address him with "Hey, [[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]", as a comment on previous efforts to [[Reclaimed word|recapture offensive words]]. He was criticized for this by some gay activists.

=== Neologisms ===
During the run of Savage Love, Savage has popularized several [[neologism]]s. He has also debunked several sexual neologisms for violent sex acts, including the "[[donkey punch]]", the "[[Pirate (sexual slang)|pirate]]" and the "[[Hot Karl (slang)|hot Karl]]", concluding "They're all fictions."&lt;ref name="savage2004"&gt;{{cite news |title=No Shit? |author=Dan Savage |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=20179&amp;mode=print |newspaper=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |date=December 23–29, 2004 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Campsite rule ====
In any relationship, but particularly those with a large difference of age or experience between the partners, the older or more experienced partner has the responsibility to leave the younger or less experienced partner in at least as good a state (emotionally and physically) as before the relationship. The "campsite rule" includes things like leaving the younger or less experienced partner with no [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]], no unwanted pregnancies, and not overburdening them with emotional and sexual baggage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Q |first=Dan |title=Savage Love Readers Talk About the Campsite Rule |pages= |newspaper=Scatmania |location= |date=May 14, 2008 |url=http://www.scatmania.org/2008/05/14/campsite/ |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tea and Sympathy rule ====
Shortly after a 2009 scandal in [[Portland, Oregon]], involving openly gay mayor [[Sam Adams (Oregon politician)|Sam Adams]] and Beau Breedlove, who had allegedly turned 18 almost immediately before the two began a sexual relationship, Savage created a companion rule to the "campsite rule", now known as the "Tea and Sympathy rule". The rule is a reference to a line in the [[Tea and Sympathy (play)|play of the same name]], in which a much older woman asks of a high-school-age boy, right before having sex with him: "Years from now, when you talk about this – and you will – be kind."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/movies/19kerr.html?pagewanted=print Deborah Kerr, Actress Known for Genteel Grace and a Sexy Beach Kiss, Dies at 86] – ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Savage claimed in an article in ''[[The Portland Mercury]]'' that, while Adams followed the "campsite rule" – Breedlove did not claim that Adams had given him any diseases or caused him emotional trauma, and in fact still refers to Adams as a friend – Breedlove violated the "Tea and Sympathy" rule by making public statements that he knew could ruin Adams's career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/the-tea-and-sympathy-rule/Content?oid=1089470 The Tea and Sympathy Rule] ''Portland Mercury''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Monogamish ====
In a July 20, 2011 column, Savage coined the term "monogamish". The term describes couples who are perceived to be [[monogamy|monogamous]], who are "mostly" monogamous, but who are not 100% monogamous. Such couples have an understanding that allows for some amount of sexual contact outside the relationship.&lt;ref name=monogamish&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=9125045 |title=Savage Love: Monogamish |last=Savage |first=Dan |date= July 20, 2011 |work=The Stranger |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage believes that of all the couples people think are 100% monogamous, a lot of them are more "monogamish" than people realize. The term has since seen mainstream use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/2998792/satisfaction-monogamish-infidelity-married/ |title=Are You 'Monogamish'?

==== Pegging ====
{{Main|Pegging (sexual practice)}}
In 2001, Savage challenged readers of his column to coin a name for the sex act in which a woman uses a strap-on [[dildo]] to perform [[anal sex]] on her male partner. After multiple nominations and a reader vote, the verb "[[pegging (sexual practice)|peg]]" was chosen, with a 43% [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] over runners-up "bob" and "punt".&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=7730 We Have a Winner!]. ''The Stranger'', June 21, 2001. Accessed April 7, 2013.&lt;!--See talk page for any thoughts.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Santorum ====
{{Main|Campaign for the neologism "santorum"|Rick Santorum's views on homosexuality}}
Savage reacted strongly to statements made about homosexuality by former [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Rick Santorum]] in an April 2003 interview with the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref name=USATodayApril232003&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-04-23-santorum-excerpt_x.htm |title=Excerpt from Santorum interview |newspaper=USA Today |issn=0734-7456 |date=April 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum included gay sex as a form of deviant sexual behavior, along with incest, [[polygamy]], and bestiality, that he said threatens society and the family; he said he believed consenting adults do not have a [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] [[right to privacy]] with respect to sexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-04-23-santorum-excerpt_x.htm Excerpt from Santorum in an interview]: "...if the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, ... [y]ou have the right to anything. Does that undermine the fabric of our society? I would argue yes, it does.", ''[[USA Today]]'', April 23, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Savage invited his readers to create a sex-related definition for "santorum" to "memorialize the Santorum scandal [...] by attaching his name to a sex act that would make his big, white teeth fall out of his big, empty head."&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Dan. [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14267 "Bill, Ashton, Rick"], ''The Stranger'', May 15, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The winning definition was "the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex."&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Dan. [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14566 "Gas Huffer"], ''The Stranger'', June 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Savage set up a website to spread the term, inviting bloggers and others to link to it, which caused it to rise to the top of a Google search for Santorum's name.&lt;ref&gt;Mencimer, Stephanie.

Colbert Rips Anti-Gay Activist, Throws 'Rentboy' Dance Party |publisher=The Huffington Post | first=Dan| last=Abramson| date=May 6, 2010 |accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoted the use of the idiom "to lift [some]one's luggage", meaning to supply sexual pleasure to, or derive it from, one's partner. This originated from Rekers who, when outed, insisted he had hired the escort only to assist him with lifting his luggage.&lt;ref name="timesonline"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7117037.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first1=Giles | last1=Whittell |title=Baptist minister 'took ten-day holiday with male prostitute' |date=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rekers also claimed he "spent a great deal of time sharing scientific information on the desirability of abandoning homosexual intercourse" and "shared the gospel of Jesus Christ with him in great detail".&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt;

Originally Savage suggested that "lifting my luggage" refer to listening to the speaker expound on the "desirability" of converting oneself from homosexual to heterosexual. Later, after several political humorists started employing "lifting your luggage" as an implicit or explicit reference to various sexual acts,&lt;ref&gt;"'Lift My Luggage' Is the New 'Hiking the Appalachian Trail'" by Daniel Kurtzman {{cite web|url=http://politicalhumor.about.com/b/2010/05/06/lift-my-luggage-is-the-new-hiking-the-appalachian-trail.htm| title=About.com --Daniel Kurtzman's Political Humor Blog|accessdate=October 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage suggested that "whatever lifts your luggage" supplant "whatever floats your boat" in common parlance.

==== Saddlebacking ====
In 2009, after a controversy involving the [[Saddleback Church]], the column defined "saddlebacking" as "the phenomenon of Christian teens engaging in unprotected anal sex in order to preserve their virginities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=1031968|title=Savage Love|work=The Stranger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Leotarded ====
After receiving criticism for use of the word "retarded"—considered by many to be an offensive slur against those with intellectual disabilities—Savage suggested "leotarded" as an alternative, because "leotard" rhymes with "retard".

=== Initialisations ===
==== GGG ====
Dan Savage coined the abbreviation "GGG".&lt;ref name="walczak"&gt;Ken Walczak, [http://www.good.is/posts/the-ggg-cocktail-a-non-vanilla-drink-inspired-by-dan-savage "The GGG Cocktail"], www.good.is, May 9, 2012 (accessed December 26, 2012) ("Dan is best known for two things: his advice that partners in any relationship strive to be Good, Giving, and Game (GGG) and ...").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/09/12/science_proves_it_dan_savage_is_right/|title=Science proves it: Dan Savage is right|author=DebHerbenick|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stands for "good, giving, and game", and it means one should strive to be ''good'' in bed, ''giving'' "equal time and equal pleasure" to one's partner, and ''game'' "for anything – within reason".&lt;ref name="Salon1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=167448 Wrong &amp; Right], ''The Stranger'' March 1, 2007 (accessed December 26, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The term has inspired the "How GGG Are You? Test" on the popular Internet dating site [[OkCupid]], and the invention of a [[cocktail]].&lt;ref name="walczak" /&gt;

==== DTMFA ====
"Dump the mother-fucker already", used at a closing of a response to indicate that acting immediately to end the writer's abusive or worthless relationship is advised.

==== ITMFA ====
A reader of Savage Love suggested the initialisation ITMFA, a take on DTMFA, meaning "Impeach the Motherfucker Already!" The initialisation was coined in reference to the [[presidency of George W. Bush]] in 2006, but was reintroduced in 2017 in reaction to the [[presidency of Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/01/25/24822658/impeach-the-motherfucker-already|title=Impeach the Motherfucker Already!|work=The Stranger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CPOS ====
"Cheating piece of shit", said of a cheater, but usually reserved for one who is chronic or abusive/passive-aggressive about it.

==== HTH ====
"How'd that happen?", a mock-incredulous reply to those to who write in and say they had certain (often sexual) things "happen to" them, as if they had no part or say in the incident, when they clearly did.

=== Usage ===
Savage objected to use of the term "pussy" as an insult, saying that vaginas were wonderful, popping out babies, and proposed "[[scrotum]]", plural "scrota", as an insult.

'''Schizophonia''' is a term coined by [[R. Murray Schafer]] to describe the splitting of an original sound and its electroacoustic reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Originally, that was not possible, as every sound was an original and could only be heard once. Schizophonia is the separation of this native sound and the recording of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Music of the Environment|last = Schafer|first = Murray|publisher = |year = |isbn = 0826416144|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''settling basin''', '''settling pond''' or '''decant pond''' is an earthen or concrete structure using [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] to remove [[settleable matter]] and [[turbidity]] from [[wastewater]]. The basins are used to control [[water pollution]] in diverse industries such as [[agriculture]],&lt;ref&gt;Sunnyside Valley Irrigation District. Sunnyside, WA.

Appendix E: Wastewater Treatment."] January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Turbidity is an optical property of water caused by scattering of light by material suspended in that water.  Although turbidity often varies directly with weight or volumetric measurements of settleable matter, correlation is complicated by variations in size, shape, [[refractive index]], and [[specific gravity]] of suspended matter.&lt;ref&gt;Franson, Mary Ann ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' 14th edition (1975) APHA, AWWA &amp; WPCF {{ISBN|0-87553-078-8}} p.131&lt;/ref&gt;  Settling ponds may be ineffective at reducing turbidity caused by small particles with specific gravity low enough to be suspended by [[Brownian motion]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Jackson &amp; Bursztynsky p.8.16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Range of Applications==
Settling basins are used as a separation mechanism to eliminate rejected products (i.e. waste solids management strategies) of a specified size and quantity in various fields, such as aquaculture, mining, dairy, food processing, alcohol production and wine making. Regular draining and desilting of settling basins is required to maintain satisfactory performance.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Western Regional Aquaculture Center, University of Washington. Seattle, WA (2001). "Settling Basin Design." WRAC Publication No. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquaculture===

All materials not removed from the system during harvesting are categorized as wastes including uneaten feed, excreta, chemicals and therapeutics, dead and moribund fish, escaped fish and pathogens. Settling basins in the field are simple ponds dug downstream of the farm to optimally remove suspended solids effectively, produce clarified effluent, and accumulate and thicken sludge to minimal volume. If impairment occurs in any of these functions, this might have a great impact on pond performance, which could lead to damaging the effectiveness of the process.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;Cripps, S. J., Bergheim A., Solids management and removal for intensive land-based aquaculture production systems,Aquacu;ture Engineering 22 (2000), page 33-68, Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining===

Wastewater produced by mining industries contribute to the acidity, suspended material and dissolved heavy metal ions in the aquatic environment, causing environmental problems for biological life and discoloration of the receiving waters. The application of settling basins by the Coeur d’Alene mining district of northern Idaho, United States, globally known to produce lead, zinc and silver, to treat wastewater has greatly improved the quality of water discharge from mining operations.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;Williams, R. E. &amp; Mink, L. L., Settling Ponds As A Mining Wastewater Treatment Facility, Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology, Moscow, 164, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dairy Waste===

By reducing flow velocity to limit solids being transported along with fast flowing liquid, separation can occur. Approximately 35% – 60% of the solids is removed from dilute liquid slurry, with 10 minutes detention time, with a common detention time of 30 to 60 minutes. Due to the inadequate consideration of critical design criteria, most settling basins built were oversized and had low efficiency.&lt;ref name="sixteen"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture. (2000): Ponds--Planning, Design, and Construction; Agriculture Handbook Number 590.&lt;/ref&gt;

Settling basins used in dairy production reduce the nutrient-loading on a vegetative filter strip from lot runoff, thus decreasing the required lagoon volume for a new facility. Moreover, settling basins are useful to remove unwanted solid materials, such as hay, straw and feathers from the waste stream before flowing to the lagoon, aids to reduce smell and avoid crust formation on the lagoon surface. A baffle may be used to retain the floating solids removed. There are two types of settling basins, based on the method of removing solids. With one type, the solids are removed mechanically (after the free water has drained away), usually with a front-end or skid-steer loader. The other type uses hydraulic (pump) removal of the solids. Typically, pumping is initiated when the basin is half full of solids and the remainder is water. Vigorous agitation is needed to mix the liquid and the solids, preferably by propeller-type agitators or pumps with agitation nozzles.&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;Fulhage, C. D., Pfost D. L. &amp;Feistner J. W., Settling Basins and Terraces for Cattle Manure, University of Missouri Extension, EQ386, new March 2002, accessed date 12 October 2013, http://extension.missouri.edu/p/EQ386&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and limitations over competitive processes==
Settling Basins are designed to retain water long enough so that suspended solids can settle to obtain a high purity water in the outlet and also provide the opportunity for pH adjustment.&lt;ref name="fourteen"&gt;“Settling Basins and Wetlands” – Alabama Aquaculture Best Management Practice (BMP)&lt;/ref&gt; Other processes that could be used: thickeners, clarifiers, hydro cyclones and membrane filtration are highly used techniques in the field.&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;R K Sinnott 2003, Coulson &amp; Richardson's Chemical Engineering, Vol 6, 3rd edn, Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to those processes, settling basins have a simpler and cheaper design, with fewer moving parts; demanding less maintenance, despite requiring cleaning and vacuuming of the quiescent zones at least once every two weeks.

However, settling basins can introduce new kinds of water contamination, particularly if the water supply is from a well. The basin can catch windblown contaminants, and if the water is retained for a long period, algae grows in the pool, leading to greater filtration problems. Settling ponds may also be ineffective at reducing turbidity caused by small particles with specific gravity low enough to be suspended by Brownian motion. Usually, it can only remove particles ranging from sand (2mm in diameter) to silt (0.002mm in diameter).

==Design considerations==
Wastewater enters the basin and very fine particles in the water are [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|separated]] by means of [[gravity]]. The water must be in the basin long enough for the desired particle size to be removed. Smaller particles require longer periods for removal and thus larger basins. In some basins a [[flocculation|flocculant]] may be added to help smaller particles stick together and form larger particles. [[Stokes' law]] can be used to calculate the size of a settling basin needed in order to remove a desired particle size.  Stokes' law gives a settling velocity determining an effective settling basin depth; so solids removal depends upon effective settling basin surface area, while the depth component of settling basin volume remains important for storage of settled solids.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Jackson &amp; Bursztynsky pp.8.12&amp;8.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Translation of required settling time surface area to settling basin geometry requires consideration of short circuiting and turbulence induced by wind, bottom scour, or inlet and overflow design.  Settling basin geometry is important because effective time of settling within the basin will be the time a volume of water spends in non-turbulent conditions before reaching the settling basin overflow.  Median time is always less than the mean time calculated by dividing available volume by anticipated flow.  The median time of passage through a short, wide settling basin may be significantly less than the median time of passage through a long, narrow settling basin.  Settling basins with overflow structures near the entrance points may hold a large volume of stagnant water while newly admitted water rapidly reaches the overflow point before settling can occur.  Effective surface area for settling seldom extends perpendicularly more than a tenth the distance of a flow line from basin entrance to overflow unless baffles are installed.&lt;ref name="gjb"&gt;Goldman, Jackson &amp; Bursztynsky p.8.20&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective surface area and geometry may change as accumulating sediment fills part of the originally constructed volume.  Short cut channels may rapidly form through heavier sediment accumulations near the entrance to the settling basin.  Flow through shallow portions of the settling basin may cause turbulence resuspending sediment from the bottom of the basin.  Two feet has been recommended as a minimum settling basin depth to avoid bottom scour.&lt;ref name="gjb"/&gt;

[[File:SomersetSpaceWalk-The Sun (open side).jpg|thumb|right|The walk begins here: the Sun model at Higher Maunsel Lock]]
The '''Somerset Space Walk''' is a [[sculpture trail]] model of the [[Solar System]], located in [[Somerset]], England. The model uses the [[towpath]] of the {{Convert|22|km|mi|abbr=off|sing=on}} [[Bridgwater and Taunton Canal]] to display a model of the [[Sun]] and its planets in their proportionally correct sizes and distances apart. Unusually for a [[Solar System model]], there are two sets of planets.

Aware of the inadequacies of printed pictures of the Solar System, the Space Walk was designed by [[inventor]] Pip Youngman as a way of challenging our perceptions of space and experiencing the vastness of the Solar System.&lt;ref name=SCC_2&gt;{{cite web| title = Services Directory – Canal Walks | publisher = [[Somerset County Council]] | date = | url = http://www.somerset.gov.uk/irj/public/services/directory/service?rid=/wpccontent/Sites/SCC/Web%20Pages/Services/Services/Environment/Canal%20walks | accessdate = 20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The model is built to a scale of 1:530,000,000,&lt;ref name=PlutoPic&gt;From the inscription on the Pluto model ([http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/2334/4420/1600/320221/BL_Space.jpg photo of Pluto sculpture at Taunton end])&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that one millimetre on the model equates to 530 kilometres. The Sun is sited at Higher Maunsel Lock, and one set of planets is installed in each direction along the canal towards [[Taunton]] and [[Bridgwater]]; the distance between the Sun and each model of [[Pluto]] being {{Convert|11|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=SCC_2 /&gt; For less hardy walkers, the inner planets are within {{Convert|67|m|ft}} of the Sun, and near to the Maunsel Canal Centre (and tea shop) at Lower Maunsel Lock, where a more detailed leaflet about the model is available.&lt;ref name=SSWleaflet /&gt;

The Space Walk was opened on 9&amp;nbsp;August 1997 by British [[astronomer]] [[Heather Couper]].&lt;ref name=SSWleaflet&gt;{{cite web|last=Youngman |first=Pip |title=Somerset Space Walk leaflet |url=http://www.hiddensomerset.com/docs/somerset_spacewalk_leaflet.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Taunton Solar Model Group |accessdate=20 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711165218/http://www.hiddensomerset.com/docs/somerset_spacewalk_leaflet.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a project team from Somerset County Council refurbished some of the models.

==Background==
[[File:Somerset Space Walk Sun 2.jpg|thumb|right|Maunsel Lock, showing the model of the Sun at the centre of the two sets of planets]]
The Walk is a joint venture between the Taunton Solar Model Group &lt;!--no web presence, don't wikilink--&gt; and [[British Waterways]], with support from [[Somerset County Council]], [[Taunton Deane]] Borough Council and the [[Somerset Waterways Development Trust]].&lt;ref name=SSWleaflet /&gt; The Taunton Solar Model Group comprised Pip Youngman, Trevor Hill – a local physics teacher who had been awarded the title of "[[Institute of Physics]] (IOP) Physics Teacher of the Year"&lt;ref name=SCGazette /&gt; – and David Applegate who, during his time as Mayor of Taunton, had expressed a wish to see some kind of science initiative in the area. Pip came up with the idea for the Space Walk, and Trevor assisted by calculating the respective positions and sizes of the planets.

Funding for the project came from the [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science]] (COPUS), the initial advertising leaflet was paid for by the [[Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council]] (PPARC) and there was also a small grant from [[Sustrans]], who fund art installations along cyclepaths, to deal with maintenance requirements in the years before Somerset County Council took on that responsibility. In order to apply for the COPUS funding Youngman needed two 'sponsors', so he wrote to [[Arthur C. Clarke]] (a local boy himself, then living in Sri Lanka) and [[Patrick Moore]], who both wrote warm letters in support. Arthur C Clarke's brother Fred read out his letter at the opening ceremony.&lt;ref name="SCGazette"&gt;{{cite news|title=Space Walk launched|newspaper=Somerset County Gazette|date=15 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RMC Group|ReadyMix Concrete]] supplied the concrete for the plinths, and [[Avimo]] (now part of [[Thales Group]]), a local defence contractor, supplied the steel for the models.&lt;!--Note for EdJogg: Refs for PPARC and COPUS are on the Space Walk leaflets!--&gt;

==Individual models==
[[File:Bathpool - Canal and Neptune.jpg|thumb|right|The model of [[Uranus]] in its setting beside the canal at Bathpool.]]
[[File:Somerset Space Walk Jupiter.jpg|thumb|right|The model of [[Jupiter]]]]
The model of the [[Sun]] is a {{convert|2.5|m|ft}}-wide 14-ton concrete sphere,&lt;ref name=SCGazette /&gt; with a vertical segment removed to give two vertical faces upon which explanatory plates are mounted. The solid sphere was cast by Pip Youngman and Trevor Hill in the grounds of what was the [[SWEB]] storage yard adjacent to the Obridge Viaduct in [[Taunton]]. Originally 'natural' in colour (matching the other models) it was painted yellow as part of the refurbishment, making it much more visible.

Each of the smallest planet models is contained within a round-topped concrete plinth about {{convert|1|m|ft}} high. The stainless steel model is held inside a circular hole through the side of the plinth; hence the model of the planet may be viewed by looking through the hole. The plinths were created by Youngman using fibreglass moulds which he had also made.

The models of the largest [[gas giant]]s, [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]], are moulded as part of the top face of the concrete pillars. Originally concrete-coloured, they have been painted as part of the refurbishment.

Each pillar doubles-up as a [[milepost]]: the distance to [[Bridgwater]] and [[Taunton]] is cast in the concrete at ground level – below a depiction of the [[British Waterways]] 'bridge' logo – although the sculptures are sited according to the spacings needed for the model, and not at kilometre increments for the convenience of boaters.

On each pillar is a plaque containing a short inscription describing the planet. The Earth inscription reads:

{{cquote|"Earth orbits far enough from the heat of the Sun for water to be liquid, near enough not to freeze, for air to be a gas and earth a solid. With gravity strong enough to hold our atmosphere, gentle enough to allow delicate life forms. Rotating to give our day and night, tilted to give the four seasons. Enormous to us, tiny on the cosmic scale. Our home, unique, beautiful, fragile." – ''Pip Youngman'' &lt;ref&gt;Caption may be read on [[:File:Somerset Space Walk Earth.jpg|photograph of model]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Nearest star==
The installation does not include a model of the [[nearest star]] for comparison, as this would be impossible. On the same scale as the other models, the nearest star ([[Proxima Centauri]], which is about one-seventh the size of the Sun) would need to be a red ball {{convert|37.5|cm|in}} in diameter&lt;ref&gt;[Calculated as one-seventh the size of the Sun: 2.63 ÷ 7 = 0.375]&lt;/ref&gt; sited {{convert|76,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;[Calculated as 270,000 x distance from Earth to Sun (270,000 x 1.496x10^8 km) ÷ 530,000,000 = 76,000km &lt;br /&gt;{{pad|2em}}(where 1:530,000,000 is the scale of the model)]&lt;/ref&gt; away (roughly twice the circumference of [[Earth]]).&lt;!--

==Pip Youngman==
The Space Walk's designer, Philip Robert Vassar Youngman&lt;!--insufficient web presence to wikilink yet--&gt; (born: 26 August 1924, Hunstanton, Norfolk – died: 23 May 2007, Taunton, Somerset), known as 'Pip', was a designer and inventor of mechanical apparatus. Around 1969, Youngman was approached by the [[Open University]] to adapt a mechanical calculator he had designed, originally prototyped in [[Lego]], into a product suitable for school use. The result was the "Ball Operated Binary Calculator And Tutor" (BOBCAT),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BOBCAT | work =  | publisher = Allard's Computer Museum, Groningen | date =  | url = http://www.computermuseumgroningen.nl/bobcat/bobcat.html | accessdate = 2009-03-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090228065606/http://www.computermuseumgroningen.nl/bobcat/bobcat.html | archivedate = 28 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a mechanical model for teaching binary arithmetic and the inner workings of the computer, using ball bearings for binary data bits and plastic levers for the calculating logic.&lt;!--and manufactured by E J Arnold--&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''resource starvation''' is a problem encountered in [[concurrent computing]] where a [[computer process|process]] is perpetually denied necessary [[Resource (computer science)|resources]] to process its work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Operating Systems |last=Tanenbaum |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Tanenbaum |year=2001 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-092641-8 |pages=184–185 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starvation may be caused by errors in a scheduling or [[mutual exclusion]] algorithm, but can also be caused by [[resource leak]]s, and can be intentionally caused via a [[denial-of-service attack]] such as a [[fork bomb]].

When starvation is impossible in a [[concurrent algorithm]], the algorithm is called '''starvation-free''', '''lockout-freed'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Art of Multiprocessor Programming |first1=Maurice |last1=Herlihy |authorlink1=Maurice Herlihy |first2=Nir |last2=Shavit |authorlink2=Nir Shavit |publisher=Elsevier |year=2012 |page=24 |isbn=9780123977953}}&lt;/ref&gt; or said to have '''finite bypass'''.{{r|raynal}} This property is an instance of [[liveness]], and is one of the two requirements for any mutual exclusion algorithm; the other being [[Correctness (computer science)|correctness]]. The name "finite bypass" means that any process (concurrent part) of the algorithm is bypassed at most a finite number times before being allowed access to the [[shared resource]].&lt;ref name="raynal"&gt;{{cite book |title=Concurrent Programming: Algorithms, Principles, and Foundations |first=Michel |last=Raynal |authorlink=Michel Raynal |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=3642320279 |page=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheduling==
Starvation is usually caused by an overly simplistic [[scheduling algorithm]]. For example, if a (poorly designed) multi-tasking system always switches between the first two tasks while a third never gets to run, then the third task is being starved of [[CPU time]]. The scheduling algorithm, which is part of the [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]], is supposed to allocate resources equitably; that is, the algorithm should allocate resources so that no process perpetually lacks necessary resources.

Many operating system schedulers employ the concept of process priority. A high priority process A will run before a low priority process B. If the high priority process (process A) blocks and never yields, the low priority process (B) will (in some systems) never be scheduled—it will experience starvation. If there is an even higher priority process X, which is dependent on a result from process B, then process X might never finish, even though it is the most important process in the system. This condition is called a [[priority inversion]].  Modern scheduling algorithms normally contain code to guarantee that all processes will receive a minimum amount of each important resource (most often CPU time) in order to prevent any process from being subjected to starvation.

In computer networks, especially wireless networks, [[scheduling algorithm]]s may suffer from scheduling starvation. An example is [[maximum throughput scheduling]].

Starvation is normally caused by [[deadlock]] in that it causes a process to freeze. Two or more processes become deadlocked when each of them is doing nothing while waiting for a resource occupied by another program in the same set. On the other hand, a process is in starvation when it is waiting for a resource that is continuously given to other processes. Starvation-freedom is a stronger guarantee than the absence of deadlock: a mutual exclusion algorithm that must choose to allow one of two processes into a [[critical section]] and picks one arbitrarily is deadlock-free, but not starvation-free.{{r|raynal}}

A possible solution to starvation is to use a scheduling algorithm with priority queue that also uses the [[Aging (scheduling)|aging]] technique. Aging is a technique of gradually increasing the priority of processes that wait in the system for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Swaffelen''' (or '''zwaffelen''') is a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] term meaning to hit one's [[penis]]—often repeatedly—against an object or another person's body. Swaffelen was named as the word of the year in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] in 2008.

The act of swaffelen often takes place in the form of teasing, crude humour or a degrading context, but can also be a [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]]. When the act is practised on a person, it is often the person's cheek that is hit. The penis is ideally semi-erect during the act. {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Origin==
The term "swaffelen" is believed to have originated in English-speaking areas.&lt;ref name=UPI /&gt; It is believed to originate from Dutch words meaning swing, sway and swoop, as well as the German words for tail or penis (Schweif and Schwanz).&lt;ref name=UPI /&gt;&lt;ref name=Expatica /&gt;

==Media coverage==
In April 2008, the term received wide media attention in the Netherlands and Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Binnenland/article/detail/303064/2008/04/14/Zaak-swaffelaar-erg-opgeblazen.dhtml ''Algemeen Dagblad, 14 april 2008: Zaak 'swaffelaar' erg opgeblazen."]&lt;/ref&gt; when a Dutch student Joost Wanders committed the act on the [[Taj Mahal]] and uploaded the video to [[YouTube]]. The student was suspended for this action.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1038/Rotterdam/article/detail/256983/2008/04/09/Student-van-school-wegens-swaffelen.dhtml ''Algemeen Dagblad'', 9 april 2008: "Student van school wegens 'swaffelen'."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the [[BNN (Dutch broadcaster)|BNN]] TV program ''[[Spuiten en Slikken]]'' invited viewers to make their own videos of other objects being swaffeled. They also called for a ''BNN Nationale Swaffeldag'' (''BNN National Swaffel Day'') to be declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZS4LageGlQ BNN-uitzending over de ''BNN Nationale Swaffeldag'' op YouTube.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]] and the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] in [[Maastricht]] were among the objects swaffeled in the submissions.

Swaffelen received further attention when [[Australian]] folk singer [[Iain Campbell Smith]] aka Fred Smith, on his return to Australia from Afghanistan{{when|date=March 2015}} released an album entitled "Dust of Uruzgan", consisting of songs responding to the war in Afghanistan, especially his comedic song ''Niet Swaffelen op de Dixi'' about Dutch soldiers in Afghanistan.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 2015 a firefighter in [[Enkhuizen]] was fired for swaffeling a colleague.&lt;ref name=ad.nl&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kooijman|first1=Tim|title=Ontslag voor brandweerman na swaffelen van collega|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Nederland/article/detail/3827964/2015/01/12/Ontslag-voor-brandweerman-na-swaffelen-van-collega.dhtml|accessdate=8 March 2015|work=AD|date=January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the topic of swearing in various languages arose, in episode 4, series N, of the British panel show ''[[QI]]'', one of the show's panelists, [[Jeremy Clarkson]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, mentioned the word,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=rockattack|title=Jeremy Clarkson on Dutch swear words (BBC Qi)|date=2016-11-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr2dhjDE2Ro&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining it as meaning, ''specifically'', "...to bang your penis against The [[Taj Mahal]]."

It was featured in episode 5 of the [[Amazon Video]] show ''[[The Grand Tour (TV series)|The Grand Tour]]''.

==Word of the year==
Swaffelen was voted as the word of the year in a 2008 competition organized by [[Genootschap Onze Taal]] (Society for Our Language), Van Dale Uitgevers (Van Dale Publishers) and the newspaper [[De Pers]].&lt;ref name=UPI&gt;{{cite news|title=Dutch pick penis-shaking term as top word|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2008/12/17/Dutch-pick-penis-shaking-term-as-top-word/UPI-73411229494794/|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=UPI|date=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Expatica&gt;{{cite web|title=Swaffelen is Dutch word of the year|url=http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/local_news/Dutch-word-of-the-year-is-swaffelen.html|work=Dutch News|publisher=Expatica|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1108992.ece/Swaffelen_woord_van_het_jaar ''De Volkskrant'', 15 december 2008: "Swaffelen woord van het jaar."]&lt;/ref&gt;  The blog [[GeenStijl.nl]] encouraged readers to vote for "swaffelen".&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/270096/Swaffelen-is-de-favoriet.html ''De Pers'', 16 december 2008.

The '''Tchaikovsky House-Museum''' was the country home in [[Klin, Klinsky District, Moscow Oblast|Klin]], 85 kilometers northwest of [[Moscow]] where [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] lived from May 1892 until his death in 1893.  His last major work, the [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|6th Symphony]], was written there. The house is now a museum.

==Tchaikovsky in Klin==
In 1885 Tchaikovsky wrote to his friend and [[patron]], "These days I dream of settling in a village not far from Moscow. I can't wander any longer, and I'm anxious to come and stay at a place where I can feel at home." Early that year he rented a small house in the village of Maidanovo (Майданово) two kilometers from the small town of Klin. Later between 1888 and 1891 he rented a house in another nearby village, Frolovskoye (Фроловское). (Both the Maidanovo house and the later Frolovskoye house were later demolished.)  Tchaikovsky lived in the Maidanovo house from February 1885 until March 1888.  The house was located on the bank of the Sestra River, and had but overgrown park with ponds and old lime trees. It was not far from the railway station to both Moscow and [[St. Petersburg]], but far enough from the city to deter unwelcome visitors, so he would not be disturbed. In the Maidanovo house Tchaikovsky rewrote an old opera he had composed in 1874, ''[[Vakula the Smith]]'', transforming it into a new opera, ''[[Cherevichki]]''. He also wrote the [[Manfred symphony]] and another opera, ''[[The Enchantress (opera)|Charodeika]]''. In the evenings Tchaikovsky read magazines and books, played the piano, had conversations with guests, strolled in the forest, gathered mushrooms, gardened and swam.

Unfortunately for Tchaikovsky, increasing numbers of vacationers came to Maidanovo, along with increasing numbers of people who wanted to see him. After a three-month concert tour to Europe, he decided to move to another house in the area, in the village of Frolovskoye.  In May 1892 Tchaikovsky wrote to his brother Anatoly:  "I rented a house in Klin to live there. Probably you saw it - the Sakharovs' house, large, comfortable, out-of-town, near the highway to Moscow...I am in need - and I feel it - of having a house in the countryside, or, which is almost the same, in Klin, to make sure that I can get, whenever I wish, a calm, quiet place to work. Besides, I've become accustomed to Klin. The view from inside the house is really wonderful, and there is a rather large garden. I am thinking of buying this house in the future."

During his time at the house in Klin, Tchaikovsky finished proof-reading the scores of ''[[Iolanta]]'' and ''[[The Nutcracker]],'' wrote eighteen piano pieces, Opus 72; The vocal quartet ''The Night'';  six romances to the words of Rathaus; and the 6th Symphony.

On October 3, 1893, he finished his [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Concert No. 3]].  On October 7 he departed from Klin for Moscow, and then to St. Petersburg where he conducted the premiere of Symphony No. 6.  He died in St. Petersburg on October 25 (November 6 new style) at the age of 53.

==Tchaikovsky's work habits==
Tchaikovsky's daily routine at Klin was described by his brother and biographer, [[Modest Tchaikovsky]]:
"Pyotr Ilyich got up between 7 and 8 a.m. in the morning. After tea and reading, he would go for a walk which usually lasted about an hour. A conversation at breakfast, as well as a walk in someone's company, meant that Tchaikovsky was not going to compose that day; instead he would be busy with instrumentation, making corrections, or writing letters.

After dinner, he went for a walk again in any weather. Solitude during walks was as necessary for him as it was during work.  In those moments he thought over the main musical themes and formed the ideas of future compositions.".&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Belonovich, pg. 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

==The interior of the Tchaikovsky House==

The house was built in the 1870s, by V.S. Sakharov, on land given to the family by Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. It was rarely used by the Sakharov family, which rented and then sold it to Tchaikovsky. Tchaikovsky lived on the second floor, while the family of his servant, Alexei Sofronov, lived on the ground floor. The kitchen and dining room were also on the first floor.

The reception room and study on the second floor, where his piano is located, is the largest room of the house. 
The piano is a Becker, which was given him by the St. Petersburg firm in 1885, when he first arrived in Maidanovo.  Tchaikovsky never played the piano in a concert hall for an audience, but he did play at home for his guests, and enjoyed playing duets on the piano with visiting musicians. His evening entertainments also usually included oral readings of literature.&lt;ref&gt;Belonovich, pg. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

His writing desk, where he wrote letters every morning after breakfast, is at the end of the room. Over the desk, in the place of honor, is a picture of [[Anton Rubenstein]], the founder of the [[St. Petersburg Conservatory of Music]] and his first teacher of instrumentation and composing. Just below the picture of Rubenstein is a picture of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]. On the other walls are many photographs of his family, in particular of his father, Ilya Petrovich Tchaikovsky, and his mother, Alexandra Andreyevna. Nearby are two bookcases containing his musical library and his library of Russian and foreign literature, and the bound sets of magazines to which his subscribed. The other cabinets in the room are filled with gifts to Tchaikovsky, including an ink-pot in the form of the Statue of Liberty given to him during his visit to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Belonovich, pg. 90-102&lt;/ref&gt;

The bedroom of the composer adjoins the reception room through a doorway covered with a curtain. He composed music in this room on a plain unpainted table overlooking the garden. The table was made of Karelian birch by village workers in Maidanovo, when he first settled in the Klin region. This was the table on which Tchaikovsky composed his 6th Symphony, the Pathetique, the last major work before his death.

==Tchaikovsky's garden==
[[File:Tchaikovsky's Garden at Klin.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Tchaikovsky's garden with a bed of lilies of the valley]]
In his final years,  Tchaikovsky was strongly attracted to nature, country life.  and his garden.  He wrote to [[Nadezhda von Meck]]:  "The nearer I approach old age, the more lovely is my pleasure being close to nature. Never before have I reveled so much in the beauty of spring, the awakening vegetation, birds returning home - in short, everything which is brought by the Russian spring, actually the most beautiful and jovial spring on earth."&lt;ref&gt;Collected letters to Nadezdha Von Meck, cited by Belonovich, pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote: "It is impossible to suggest a better a more suitable way of living than in the countryside.  After each new trip to Moscow I come to realize more and more how city life ruins me. Each time I return here I'm completely ill, but I immediately recover in my quiet corner."&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Belonovich, pg. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

His garden was not tidy and orderly, but rather like an idealized forest, with a winding path and a [[gazebo]] at the far end from the house. Tchaikovsky adored flowers, particularly the wild flowers of the fields and forest that he saw on his daily walks. He was especially fond of the [[lily of the valley]], to which he even wrote a poem. After his death, his brother Modest planted islands of lilies of the valley around the garden, along with the [[Viola mandshurica|violets]], [[Myosotis|forget-me-nots]], and [[Hyacinthoides non-scripta|bluebells]] that Tchaikovsky admired. The garden has many other varieties of flowers it had in Tchaikovsky's time: [[rose]]s, [[begonia]]s, [[gillyflower]]s, [[phlox]]es, and [[Nicotiana alata|sweet tobacco]].&lt;ref&gt;Belonovich, pg. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The house and the Museum after Tchaikovsky's death==
[[File:Monument to Tchaikovsky, Klin.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Statue of Tchaikovsky near his garden at Klin]]
After Tchaikovsky's death, his younger brother, [[Modest Tchaikovsky]], a playwright and translator, decided to create a museum, the first such musical and memorial museum in Russia.  The composer's nephew, [[Vladimir Davydov]], who held the rights to Tchaikovsky's works, joined in the project.  They built a separate house on the grounds so the main house could remain as it was, and made an archive of Tchaikovsky's musical scores, manuscripts and library.  Modest Tchaikovsky wrote the first biography of Tchaikovsky,

When Modest Tchaikovsky died in 1916, he willed the house to the Moscow Department of the [[Russian Musical Society]], with the requirement that it strictly follow the rules of the Mozart Museum in [[Salzburg]] and the [[Beethoven House|Beethoven Museum]] in [[Bonn]].

In 1917, after the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik revolution]],  an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] named Doroshenko settled with his family in the museum, and was reported to have fired shots at the portrait of Pope Innocent hanging in one of the bedrooms.  He was finally arrested in April, 1918. In 1918 the museum was given the status of protected site by the [[People's Commissariat for Education]], and in 1921 it was declared to be property of the state.

Following the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of Russia]] in June 1941, the museum collection of memorabilia and the library were transferred to the small town of [[Votkinsk]], Tchaikovsky's birthplace, in [[Udmurtia]]. The house was occupied by the Germans during the [[Battle of Moscow]] in 1941-42. They used the first floor as a garage for motorcycles and the upper floor as a barracks.  At the end of 1944, the exhibits were returned, and the museum opened again on May 6, 1945, on the eve of Tchaikovsky's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Belonovich, pg. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s it became a tradition for musicians to gather and perform at the house on May 7 each year to commemorate Tchaikovsky's birthday.  Noted pianists, including [[Vladimir Horowitz]], were given the privilege of playing Tchaikovsky's grand piano in his salon.  Beginning in 1958, winners of the annual [[International Tchaikovsky Competition]], including [[Van Cliburn]] (1958), [[Mikhail Pletnev]] (1978) and [[Boris Berezovsky (pianist)|Boris Berezovsky]] (1990), were also invited to come to Klin to play his piano. Musicians from the competition began a tradition of planting [[oak|oak trees]] in the garden.

In 1964, a concert hall, exhibit space and visitor center was opened near the house.

'''''The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music''''' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik}}) is an 1872 work of [[dramatic theory]] by the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. It was reissued in 1886 as ''The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism'' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie, Oder: Griechentum und Pessimismus}}). The later edition contained a prefatory essay, "[[s:An Attempt at Self-Criticism|An Attempt at Self-Criticism]]", wherein Nietzsche commented on this earliest book.

== The Book ==

Nietzsche found in [[Theater of ancient Greece|classical Athenian]] [[tragedy]] an art form that transcended the [[pessimism]] and [[nihilism]] of a fundamentally meaningless world. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering and affirming it, passionately and joyously affirmed the meaning of their own existence. They knew themselves to be infinitely more than petty individuals, finding self-affirmation not in another life, not in a world to come, but in the terror and ecstasy alike celebrated in the performance of tragedies.

Originally educated as a [[philology|philologist]], Nietzsche discusses the history of the tragic form and introduces an intellectual [[dichotomy]] between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysian and the Apollonian]] (very loosely: reality as disordered and undifferentiated by forms versus reality as ordered and differentiated by forms). Nietzsche claims life always involves a struggle between these two elements, each battling for control over the existence of humanity. In Nietzsche's words, "Wherever the Dionysian prevailed, the Apollonian was checked and destroyed.... wherever the first Dionysian onslaught was successfully withstood, the authority and majesty of the Delphic god [[Apollo]] exhibited itself as more rigid and menacing than ever." Yet neither side ever prevails due to each containing the other in an eternal, natural check or balance.

Nietzsche argues that the tragedy of Ancient Greece was the highest form of art due to its mixture of both Apollonian and Dionysian elements into one seamless whole, allowing the spectator to experience the full spectrum of the [[human condition]]. The Dionysian element was to be found in the music of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]], while the Apollonian element was found in the dialogue which gave a concrete symbolism that balanced the Dionysian revelry. Basically, the Apollonian spirit was able to give form to the abstract Dionysian.

Before the tragedy, there was an era of static, idealized plastic art in the form of sculpture that represented the Apollonian view of the world. The Dionysian element was to be found in the wild revelry of festivals and drunkenness, but, most importantly, in music. The combination of these elements in one art form gave birth to tragedy. He theorizes that the chorus was originally always [[satyr]]s, goat-men. (This is speculative, although the word “tragedy” τραγωδία is contracted from trag(o)-aoidiā = "goat song" from ''tragos'' = "goat" and ''aeidein'' = "to sing".) Thus, he argues, “the illusion of culture was wiped away by the primordial image of man” for the audience; they participated with and as the chorus empathetically, “so that they imagined themselves as restored natural geniuses, as satyrs.” But in this state, they have an Apollonian dream vision of themselves, of the energy they're embodying. It's a vision of the god, of Dionysus, who appears before the chorus on the stage. And the actors and the plot are the development of that dream vision, the essence of which is the ecstatic dismembering of the god and of the [[Bacchante]]s' rituals, of the inseparable ecstasy and suffering of human existence.

After the time of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]], there was an age where tragedy died.  Nietzsche ties this to the influence of writers like [[Euripides]] and the coming of rationality, represented by [[Socrates]].  Euripides reduced the use of the chorus and was more naturalistic in his representation of human drama, making it more reflective of the realities of daily life. Socrates emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of myth and suffering to human knowledge. For Nietzsche, these two intellectuals helped drain the ability of the individual to participate in forms of art, because they saw things too soberly and rationally. The ''[[participation mystique]]'' aspect of art and myth was lost, and along with it, much of man's ability to live creatively in [[optimistic]] harmony with the sufferings of life. Nietzsche concludes that it may be possible to reattain the balance of Dionysian and Apollonian in modern art through the operas of [[Richard Wagner]], in a ''rebirth'' of tragedy.

In contrast to the typical [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] view of ancient Greek culture as noble, simple, elegant and grandiose, Nietzsche believed the Greeks were grappling with pessimism. The universe in which we live is the product of great interacting forces; but we neither observe nor know these as such. What we put together as our conceptions of the world, Nietzsche thought, never actually addresses the underlying realities. It is human destiny to be controlled by the darkest universal realities and, at the same time, to live life in a human-dreamt world of illusions.

The issue, then, or so Nietzsche thought, is how to experience and understand the Dionysian side of life without destroying the obvious values of the Apollonian side. It is not healthy for an individual, or for a whole society, to become entirely absorbed in the rule of one or the other. The soundest (healthiest) foothold is in both. Nietzsche's theory of Athenian tragic drama suggests exactly how, before Euripides and Socrates, the Dionysian and Apollonian elements of life were artistically woven together. The Greek spectator became healthy through direct experience of the Dionysian within the protective spirit-of-tragedy on the Apollonian stage.

==History==
In January and February 1870, Nietzsche delivered two lectures about ancient Greek drama. After receiving copies of the lectures, his friends Richard and [[Cosima Wagner]] suggested that he write a book about the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1871, he submitted a manuscript to publisher [[Wilhelm Engelmann]]. When Englemann was unresponsive, Nietzsche asked for the return of the manuscript in June. He had a portion of the book [[Vanity press|privately printed]] under the title ''Socrates and Greek Tragedy'' ({{lang-de|Sokrates und griechische Tragödie}}) and sent to friends. Richard Wagner received the first copy on 18 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1871, Nietzsche submitted a revised manuscript to E. W. Fritzsch, who had published works by Wagner. Fritzsch accepted the book in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing was completed at the end of December, and the book, now titled ''The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music'' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik}}), reached bookstores on 2 January 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second edition was printed by Fritzsch in 1874, but due to the publisher's financial problems, it was not bound until 1875 and had little circulation. In 1878, the remaining copies and publication rights for the first two editions were acquired by Nietzsche's new publisher, Ernst Schmeitzner.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=65–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1886, Nietzsche had fallen out with Schmeitzner, and Fritzsch had recovered from his financial difficulties. Fritzsch published a new edition in October 1886, retitled ''The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism'' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie, Oder: Griechentum und Pessimismus}}), with an added prefatory essay by Nietzsche called "An Attempt at Self-Criticism", commenting on the earlier editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
''The Birth of Tragedy'' is a young man's work, and shows the influence of many of the philosophers Nietzsche had been studying. His interest in classical Greece as in some respects a rational society can be attributed in some measure to the influence of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], although Nietzsche departed from Winckelmann in many ways.  In addition, Nietzsche uses the term "naïve" in exactly the sense used by [[Friedrich Schiller]]. Of great importance are the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], especially ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''. The Apollonian experience bears great similarity to the experience of the world as "representation" in Schopenhauer's sense, and the experience of the Dionysian bears similarities to the identification with the world as "will." Nietzsche opposed Schopenhauer's Buddhistic negation of the will. He argued that life is worth living despite the enormous amount of cruelty and suffering that exists.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

One year before the publication of ‘’The Birth of Tragedy’’, Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ljp2NPK0qPAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=nietzsche+%2B+%22what+we+here+have+asserted%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vxdZT8bsHc6I0QGJt_DRDw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Music and Words]. In it he asserted the Schopenhauerian judgment that  music is a primary expression of the essence of everything.  Secondarily derivative are lyrical poetry and drama, which represent mere phenomenal appearances of objects. In this way, tragedy is born from music.

== Reception ==
''The Birth of Tragedy'' was angrily criticized by many respected professional scholars of Greek literature. Particularly vehement was philologist [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]], who denounced Nietzsche's work as slipshod and misleading. Prompted by Nietzsche, [[Erwin Rohde]]—a friend who had written a favorable review that sparked the first derogatory debate over the book—responded by exposing Wilamowitz-Moellendorf's inaccurate citations of Nietzsche's work. [[Richard Wagner]] also issued a response to Wilamowitz-Moellendorf's critique, but his action only served to characterize Nietzsche as the composer's lackey.

In his denunciation of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', Wilamowitz says:

:Herr N. ... is also a professor of classical philology; he treats a series of very important questions of Greek literary history. ... This is what I want to illuminate, and it is easy to prove that here also imaginary genius and impudence in the presentation of his claims stands in direct relation to his ignorance and lack of love of the truth. ... His solution is to belittle the historical-critical method, to scold any aesthetic insight which deviates from his own, and to ascribe a "complete misunderstanding of the study of antiquity" to the age in which philology in Germany, especially through the work of [[Gottfried Hermann]] and [[Karl Lachmann]], was raised to an unprecedented height.

In suggesting the Greeks might have had problems, Nietzsche was departing from the scholarly traditions of his age, which viewed the Greeks as a happy, perhaps even naive, and simple people. The work is a web of professional [[philology]], philosophical insight, and admiration of musical art. As a work in philology, it was almost immediately rejected, virtually destroying Nietzsche's academic aspirations. The music theme was so closely associated with Richard Wagner that it became an embarrassment to Nietzsche once he himself had achieved some distance and independence from Wagner. It stands, then, as Nietzsche's first complete, published philosophical work, one in which a battery of questions are asked, sketchily identified, and questionably answered.

Marianne Cowan, in her introduction to Nietzsche's ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', describes the situation in these words:
:''The Birth of Tragedy'' presented a view of the Greeks so alien to the spirit of the time and to the ideals of its scholarship that it blighted Nietzsche's entire academic career.  It provoked pamphlets and counter-pamphlets attacking him on the grounds of common sense, scholarship and sanity. For a time, Nietzsche, then a professor of classical philology at the [[University of Basel]], had no students in his field.  His lectures were sabotaged by German philosophy professors who advised their students not to show up for Nietzsche's courses.

By 1886, Nietzsche himself had reservations about the work, and he published a preface in the 1886 edition where he re-evaluated some of his main concerns and ideas in the text. In this post-script, Nietzsche referred to ''The Birth of Tragedy'' as "an impossible book... badly written, ponderous, embarrassing, image-mad and image-confused, sentimental, saccharine to the point of effeminacy, uneven in tempo, [and] without the will to logical cleanliness."&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, he defended the "arrogant and rhapsodic book" for inspiring "fellow-rhapsodizers" and for luring them on to "new secret paths and dancing places."

In 1888, in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', Nietzsche was back on the attack. He defends ''The Birth of Tragedy'' by stating: "...It is indifferent toward politics,—'un-German,' to use the language of the present time—it smells offensively Hegelian, and the cadaverous perfume of Schopenhauer sticks only to a few formulas. An 'idea'—the antithesis of the Dionysian and the Apollinian—translated into the metaphysical; history itself as the development of this 'idea'; in tragedy this antithesis is sublimated into a unity; under this perspective things that had never before faced each other are suddenly juxtaposed, used to illuminate each other, and comprehended... Opera, for example, and the revolution.— The two decisive innovations of the book are, first, its understanding of the Dionysian phenomenon among the Greeks: for the first time, a psychological analysis of this phenomenon is offered, and it is considered as one root of the whole of Greek art. The other is the understanding of Socratism: Socrates is recognized for the first time as an instrument of Greek disintegration, as a typical décadent. 'Rationality' against instinct. 'Rationality' at any price as a dangerous force that undermines life!— Profound, hostile silence about Christianity throughout the book. That is neither Apollinian nor Dionysian; it negates all aesthetic values—the only values that the 'Birth of Tragedy' recognizes: it is nihilistic in the most profound sense, while in the Dionysian symbol the ultimate limit of affirmation is attained. There is one allusion [The Birth of Tragedy, 24] to Christian priests as a 'vicious kind of dwarfs' who are 'subterranean' ..."

In the title of his novel ''[[The Magic Mountain]]'', [[Thomas Mann]] alludes to a passage from ''The Birth of Tragedy'', and the influence of Nietzsche's work can be seen in the novel's character Mynheer Peepercorn, who embodies the "Dionysian principle."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, ''The Birth of Tragedy'' (Trans. Douglas Smith), Oxford University Press, 2008: pp. xxxii, 28, 109, 140. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954014-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of a critical study of Nietzsche's "atheist humanism", the influential Catholic theologian [[Henri de Lubac]] considered it "a work of genius", and dedicated several pages of his study to explicate the relationship between Nietzsche's early thought and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;De Lubac, Henri, ''The Drama of Atheist Humanism'', Ignatius Press (San Francisco), 2008: pp. 74, 82. For De Lubac's full discussion of this early work of Nietzsche, see ''id''., pp. 73–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Timelines of [[invention]]s display the development and progression of art, design, architecture, music and literature

==Invention in art, design and architecture==

''dates may be approximations''

* 350,000 BCE – [[Paint]] was invented by early man.  Pigment and paint grinding equipment was found in a cave at Twin Rivers near Lusaka, Zambia.
* 31,000 BCE – Representational painting was invented.  Murals of stampeding bulls, cantering horses, red bears and woolly rhinoceros are found in the [[Chauvet Cave]]s in France.
* 22,000 BCE – [[Sculpture]] was invented by [[Paleolithic]] tribes who created the female statuette called the [[Venus of Willendorf]], found in near Willendorf, Austria.
* 4000 BCE – [[Papyrus]], the precursor to [[paper]], was invented by the Egyptians by pounding flat woven mats of reeds.
* 2500 BCE – Egyptian blue pigment was invented by Egyptian chemists using a mixture of limestone (calcium oxide), malachite (copper oxide) and quartz (silica) fired to about 800–900 degrees Celsius.
* 500 BCE – [[Encaustic painting|Encaustic]] paints are invented by Greek artists by mixing colored pigments and wax.
* 450 BCE – Depicting the illusion of three-dimensional form on a two-dimensional surface was invented with the [[chiaroscuro]] painting technique that employs highlights and shadows.
* 250 BCE – [[Glassblowing]] was invented by Syrian craftsmen in Babylonia.
* 105 – [[Paper]] was invented by Ts’ai Lun, a Chinese court official.
* 650 – [[Porcelain]] was invented by Chinese artists in the Tang Dynasty as a fired mixture of kaolin (a clay) and petuntse (a feldspar).
* 1306 – A more naturalistic means of representational painting was invented by [[Giotto di Bondone]] using depth, perspective and temporal realism to present a single moment in time.
* 15th century – A [[cupola]] or dome which did not require a framework supporting its curves was invented by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]].  To transport the large stones to the construction site, Brunelleschi invented a unique boat capable of moving heavy cargo upriver and was granted exclusive rights to use his boat to move heavy loads, patent rights.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Patenting Art and Entertainment by Gregory Aharonian and Richard Stim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 15th century – [[Linear perspective]] was invented with work by Filippo Brunelleschi, and a treatise on perspective theory by [[Leon Battista Alberti]].   Perspective is a method for depicting the illusion of three-dimensions on a two-dimensional surface.&lt;ref&gt;ArtLex at www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Li.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1420 – The use of a single, consistent light source in painting with figures painted to appear three-dimensional was invented by the Italian artist [[Masaccio]] (Tommaso di Giovanni).  See his 1427 painting, "Tribute Money".
* 1485 – [[Sfumato]], a painting technique in which an atmospheric or blurry effect is created with minute transitions between color areas, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci.  Sfumato is seen in Leonardo's "Virgin on the Rocks" and "[[Mona Lisa]]".
* 1503 – [[Surrealism]] was invented by Flemish artist [[Hieronymus Bosch]] with his triptych "[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]".
* 1774 – [[Jasperware]], a dense vitreous pottery that could be turned on a lathe, was invented by [[Josiah Wedgwood]].
* 1816 – The photograph was invented by Joseph [[Nicephore Niepce]] using paper coated with [[silver chloride]] "fixed" with nitric acid.
* 1816 – a resolution contrast technique of painting and drawing was invented by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] who used it to depict faces in high resolution with the rest of the image in low resolution, as for example in his drawing "Mrs. Charles Badham".
* 1861 – The color photograph was invented by physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]].
* 1863 – Multiple subject painting was invented by [[Édouard Manet]].  His "[[Le dejeuner sur l'herbe]]" presents four disconnected figures not looking at one another, lighted from different directions.  Dejeuner sur l'herbe also has a disconnected background-to-foreground perspective that eliminates the middle ground.
* 1865 – [[Chromolithograph]] prints were invented by [[Jules Chéret]].
* 1872 – Serial photomontage, the precursor to [[motion pictures]], was invented by [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] by using multiple cameras to photograph moving objects.
* 1873 – Nonlinear horizon lines were invented by Édouard Manet, eliminating the horizon line in his 1874 painting "Boating".
* 1882 – Multiple time depiction was invented by Édouard Manet in his ''"[[A Bar at the Folies-Bergère]]"'', which depicts a bar scene from two points in space at two different moments in time.
* 1884 – [[Pointillism]] was invented by [[Georges Seurat]], who created entire paintings using small dots of pure unmixed color.
* 1886 – [[Trompe l'oeil]] was invented by [[William Michael Harnett]], an American painter.
* 1888 – A technique of portraying a subject from different perspectives and of distorting subject matter in painting was invented by [[Paul Cézanne]].
* 1891 – A technique of unfreezing time in still images was invented by [[Claude Monet]], who painted the same subject at many different times during the day, showing how it appeared differently largely due to the change in natural light.  He painted the cathedral at Rouen at 40 different times of the day and he painted the same haystack at 20 different moments in a year.
* 1902- A technique of indeterminate time was invented in painting by Paul Cézanne in his painting "Mont Sainte-Victorie", in which the sources and direction of light are not discernible.
* 1902 – The [[teddy bear]] was invented by Morris and Rose Michtom based on a cartoon of a bear saved by President Theodore Roosevelt.
* 1903 – The 3-D (three-dimensional) movie was invented by [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] with their one-minute film "L’Arrivée du Train".
* 1904 – [[Fauvism]] was invented by [[Henri Matisse]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[André Derain]] and others.
* 1907 – A variety of special effects for film were invented by [[Georges Méliès]] in his film ''[[Tunneling the English Channel]]'', including stop-motion photography, split-screen photography, [[stop action animation]] and the combination of live action with full-scale mechanical backgrounds.
* 1915 – The multistable image was invented by W. E. Hill, with his drawing "My Wife and My Mother-in-Law", an image that can present either a young woman or an older woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Patenting Art and Entertainment'' by Gregory Aharonian and Richard Stim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1908 to 1917 – [[Cubism]] was invented by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]].  In Cubist artworks, the subject, whether it be a figure or a still life, is broken up and reassembled, and presented from multiple views simultaneously.  Cubism revolutionized western art, and influenced other art forms like music and literature.
* 1912 – [[Collage]] was invented by Picasso with his "Still Life with Chair Caning".  Attaching a material from the real world that was not ever used in high art into a painting violated what was previously considered the integrity of the artwork.  Collage was a new process for making art, a new art form, and it expanded the definition of art.
* 1912 – The [[Construction]] was invented by Picasso when he created "Guitar" in 1912 by joining parts together.  This additive image-making process was new to western sculpture which was previously made using subtractive processes like carving stone or wood, or modeling clay which may have then been cast in metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moodbook.com/history/modernism/pablo-picasso.html |title=Pablo Picasso. Art, life, and world of modern |publisher=Moodbook.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1917 – the [[Readymade]] was invented and exhibited by [[Marcel Duchamp]], "The Fountain" an upturned urinal signed by the artist.  The Readymade expanded the definition of art and of an artist.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=11&amp;region=na#/Key-Events |title=The United States and Canada, 1900 A.D.–present &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1917 – [[De Stijl]] a kind of art based on pure geometry was invented by [[Theo van Doesburg]].
* 1926 – [[Science fiction]] movies were invented by [[Fritz Lang]] with his movie ''Metropolis'', which incorporates dynamic visual and special effects.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* 1928 – [[Welded sculpture]], a new medium, a new process and a new art form, was invented by Pablo Picasso and Julio Gonzalez, opening up the solid form of sculpture to negative space and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;World History of Art by Hugh Honour, Laurence King Publishing 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1928 – [[Mickey Mouse]] was created by Walt Disney.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt;
* 1929 – [[Film noir]] was invented by [[Josef Sternberg]] with his film ''Thunderbolt''.
* 1932 – The [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile]] was invented by [[Alexander Calder]].
* 1936 – A device that greatly speeds up the process of making cartoons and enables them to appear more realistic was invented and patented by [[Walt Disney]], who used it to create the classic ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' in 1937.  Refer to US Patent 2,201,689.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* 1947–50 – Painting was reinvented by [[Jackson Pollock]] whose novel method of spontaneously dripping and splattering paint from a can onto unscratched canvas laid out on the floor brought about an expanded understanding of pure abstraction and of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manythings.org/voa/people/Jackson_Pollock.html |title=and also Michael Kimmelman www.NY Times.com "A Drip by Any Other Name", February 12, 2006 |publisher=Manythings.org |date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1948 – The [[Glass House]] by the architect [[Philip Johnson]] reduced building down to its most basic elements: a horizontal slab on the ground, vertical supports, a flat roof and transparent glass wrapped around it.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt;
* 1952 – Stain painting, in which liquid paint soaks and bleeds into the fabric of unprimed canvas, was invented by [[Joan Miró]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]] and [[Jackson Pollock]] who influenced [[Helen Frankenthaler]], as seen in her painting "Mountains and Sea" of 1952.
* 1959 – the first public "[[happening]]" was produced by Allan Kaprow at the Reuben Gallery in New York.  A happening is defined by Kaprow as a choreographed event that facilitates interactions between objects including performers and visitors.  Happenings were influenced by Jackson Pollock's process of action painting, Dada and the teachings of John Cage on chance and indeterminacy.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt;

==Definition==
===Tree stack===
[[File:Tree stack.svg|thumb|A tree stack with stack pointer 1.2 and domain {''ε'', 1, 42, 1.2, 1.5, 1.5.3}]]

For a finite and non-empty set {{math|''Γ''}}, a ''tree stack over {{math|{{var|Γ}}}}'' is a tuple {{math|(''t'', ''p'')}} where
* {{math|''t''}} is a [[partial function]] from strings of positive integers to the set {{math|''Γ'' ∪ {@}}} with [[Substring#Prefix|prefix]]-closed{{efn|A set of strings is ''prefix-closed'' if for every element {{math|''w''}} in the set, all prefixes of {{math|''w''}} are also in the set.}} [[domain of a function|domain]] (called ''tree''),
* {{math|@}} (called ''bottom symbol'') is not in {{math|''Γ''}} and appears exactly at the root of {{math|''t''}}, and
* {{math|''p''}} is an element of the domain of {{math|''t''}} (called ''stack pointer'').
The set of all tree stacks over {{math|''Γ''}} is denoted by {{math|TS(''Γ'')}}.

The set of ''predicates'' on {{math|TS(''Γ'')}}, denoted by {{math|Pred(''Γ'')}}, contains the following [[unary operation|unary]] [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]]:
* {{math|true}} which is true for any tree stack over {{math|''Γ''}},
* {{math|bottom}} which is true for tree stacks whose stack pointer points to the bottom symbol, and
* {{math|equals(''γ'')}} which is true for some tree stack {{math|(''t'', ''p'')}} if {{math|''t''(''p'') {{=}} ''γ''}},
for every {{math|''γ'' ∈ ''Γ''}}.

The set of ''instructions'' on {{math|TS(''Γ'')}}, denoted by {{math|Instr(''Γ'')}}, contains the following partial functions:
* {{math|id: TS(''Γ'') → TS(''Γ'')}} which is the identity function on {{math|TS(''Γ'')}},
* {{math|push&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''γ''&lt;/sub&gt;: TS(''Γ'') → TS(''Γ'')}} which adds for a given tree stack {{math|(''t'',''p'')}} a pair {{math|(''pn'' ↦ ''γ'')}} to the tree {{math|''t''}} and sets the stack pointer to {{math|''pn''}} (i.e. it pushes {{math|''γ''}} to the {{math|''n''}}-th child position) if {{math|''pn''}} is not yet in the domain of {{math|''t''}},
* {{math|up&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;: TS(''Γ'') → TS(''Γ'')}} which replaces the current stack pointer {{math|''p''}} by {{math|''pn''}} (i.e. it moves the stack pointer to the {{math|''n''}}-th child position) if {{math|''pn''}} is in the domain of {{math|''t''}},
* {{math|down: TS(''Γ'') → TS(''Γ'')}} which removes the last symbol from the stack pointer (i.e. it moves the stack pointer to the parent position), and 
* {{math|set&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt;: TS(''Γ'') → TS(''Γ'')}} which replaces the symbol currently under the stack pointer by {{math|''γ''}}, 
for every positive integer {{math|''n''}} and every {{math|''γ'' ∈ ''Γ''}}.

===Tree stack automata===
A ''tree stack automaton'' is a 6-tuple {{math|''A'' {{=}} (''Q'', ''Γ'', ''Σ'', ''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, ''δ'', ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)}} where
* {{math|''Q''}}, {{math|''Γ''}}, and {{math|''Σ''}} are finite sets (whose elements are called ''states'', ''stack symbols'', and ''input symbols'', respectively),
* {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; ''Q''}} (the ''initial state''),
* {{math|''δ'' &amp;sube;&lt;sub&gt;fin.&lt;/sub&gt; ''Q'' × (''Σ'' ∪ {''ε''}) × Pred(''Γ'') × Instr(''Γ'') × ''Q''}} (whose elements are called ''transitions''), and
* {{math|''Q''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;sube; TS(''Γ'')}} (whose elements are called ''final states'').

A ''configuration of {{math|{{var|A}}}}'' is a tuple {{math|(''q'', ''c'', ''w'')}} where
* {{math|''q''}} is a state (the ''current state''),
* {{math|''c''}} is a tree stack (the ''current tree stack''), and
* {{math|''w''}} is a word over {{math|''Σ''}} (the ''remaining word'' to be read).

A transition {{math|''τ'' {{=}} (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u'', ''p'', ''f'', ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is ''applicable'' to a configuration {{math|(''q'', ''c'', ''w'')}} if
* {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''q''}},
* {{math|''p''}} is true on {{math|''c''}},
* {{math|''f''}} is defined for {{math|''c''}}, and
* {{math|''u''}} is a prefix of {{math|''w''}}.
The ''transition relation of {{math|{{var|A}}}}'' is the [[binary relation]] {{math|⊢}} on configurations of {{math|{{var|A}}}} that is the union of all the relations {{math|⊢&lt;sub&gt;''τ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for a transition {{math|''τ'' {{=}} (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u'', ''p'', ''f'', ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} where, whenever {{math|''τ''}} is applicable to {{math|(''q'', ''c'', ''w'')}}, we have {{math|(''q'', ''c'', ''w'') ⊢&lt;sub&gt;''τ''&lt;/sub&gt; (''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''(''c''), ''v'')}} and {{math|''v''}} is obtained from {{math|''w''}} by removing the prefix {{math|''u''}}.

The ''language of {{math|{{var|A}}}}'' is the set of all words {{math|''w''}} for which there is some state {{math|''q'' ∈ ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;}} and some tree stack {{math|''c''}} such that {{math|(''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, w) ⊢&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; (''q'', ''c'', ''ε'')}} where
* {{math|⊢&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the [[Binary relation#Operations on binary relations|reflexive transitive closure]] of {{math|⊢}} and
* {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (''t''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ε'')}} such that {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} assigns for {{math|''ε''}} the symbol {{math|@}} and is undefined otherwise.

==Related formalisms==
Tree stack automata are equivalent to [[Turing machine|Turing machines]].

A tree stack automaton is called ''{{math|{{var|k}}}}-restricted'' for some positive natural number {{math|{{var|k}}}} if, during any run of the automaton, any position of the tree stack is accessed at most {{math|''k''}} times from below.

1-restricted tree stack automata are equivalent to [[pushdown automaton|pushdown automata]] and therefore also to [[context-free grammar|context-free grammars]].
{{math|''k''}}-restricted tree stack automata are equivalent to [[Generalized context-free grammar#Linear Context-free Rewriting Systems (LCFRSs)|linear context-free rewriting systems]] and multiple context-free grammars of fan-out at most {{math|''k''}} (for every positive integer {{math|''k''}}).&lt;ref name="Den16" /&gt;

'''Two-hybrid screening''' (originally known as '''yeast two-hybrid system''' or '''Y2H''') is a [[molecular biology]] technique used to discover [[protein–protein interaction]]s (PPIs)&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young KH | title = Yeast two-hybrid: so many interactions, (in) so little time | journal = Biology of Reproduction | volume = 58 | issue = 2 | pages = 302–11 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9475380 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod58.2.302 | url = http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/reprint/58/2/302 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927133205/http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/reprint/58/2/302 | archivedate = 27 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[DNA-binding protein#Protein–DNA interactions|protein–DNA interactions]]&lt;ref name="joung"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Joung JK, Ramm EI, Pabo CO | title = A bacterial two-hybrid selection system for studying protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = 13 | pages = 7382–7 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10852947 | pmc = 16554 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.110149297 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/13/7382 | bibcode = 2000PNAS...97.7382J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurt JA, Thibodeau SA, Hirsh AS, Pabo CO, Joung JK | title = Highly specific zinc finger proteins obtained by directed domain shuffling and cell-based selection | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 21 | pages = 12271–6 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14527993 | pmc = 218748 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.2135381100 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/21/12271 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..10012271H }}&lt;/ref&gt; by testing for physical interactions (such as binding) between two [[protein]]s or a single protein and a [[DNA]] molecule, respectively.

The premise behind the test is the activation of [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|downstream]] [[reporter gene]](s) by the binding of a [[transcription factor]] onto an [[upstream activating sequence]] (UAS). For two-hybrid screening, the transcription factor is split into two separate fragments, called the DNA-binding domain (DBD or often also abbreviated as BD) and activating domain (AD). The BD is the [[protein domain|domain]] responsible for [[DNA-binding protein|binding]] to the UAS and the AD is the domain responsible for the activation of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]].&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; The Y2H is thus a [[protein-fragment complementation assay]].

== History ==

Pioneered by [[Stanley Fields (biologist)|Stanley Fields]] and Ok-Kyu Song in 1989, the technique was originally designed to detect protein–protein interactions using the [[Gal4]] transcriptional activator of the yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''. The [[Gal4]] protein activated transcription of a gene involved in galactose utilization, which formed the basis of selection.&lt;ref name="fields"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fields S, Song O | title = A novel genetic system to detect protein-protein interactions | journal = Nature | volume = 340 | issue = 6230 | pages = 245–6 | date = July 1989 | pmid = 2547163 | doi = 10.1038/340245a0 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v340/n6230/abs/340245a0.html;jsessionid=2F9E056F57E5547D17D2D6658C9B0437 | format = abstract | bibcode = 1989Natur.340..245F }} Abstract is free; full-text article is not.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the same principle has been adapted to describe many alternative methods, including some that detect protein–DNA interactions or DNA-DNA interactions, as well as methods that use different [[#Host organism|host organisms]] such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' or mammalian cells instead of yeast.&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Luo"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luo Y, Batalao A, Zhou H, Zhu L | title = Mammalian two-hybrid system: a complementary approach to the yeast two-hybrid system | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 350–2 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9043710 | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00010/97222pf02_10525a.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic premise ==

The key to the two-hybrid screen is that in most [[eukaryotic]] transcription factors, the activating and binding domains are modular and can function in proximity to each other without direct binding.&lt;ref name="verschure"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verschure PJ, Visser AE, Rots MG | title = Step out of the groove: epigenetic gene control systems and engineered transcription factors | journal = Advances in Genetics | volume = 56 | issue =  | pages = 163–204 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16735158 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2660(06)56005-5 | isbn = 9780120176564 | series = Advances in Genetics }} {{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that even though the transcription factor is split into two fragments, it can still activate transcription when the two fragments are indirectly connected.

The most common screening approach is the yeast two-hybrid assay. In this approach the researcher knows where each prey is located on the used medium (agar plates). Millions of potential interactions in several organisms have been screened in the latest decade using  [[high-throughput screening]] systems (often using robots) and over thousands of interactions have been detected and categorized in databases as [https://thebiogrid.org BioGRID].&lt;ref name="Brückner"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brückner A, Polge C, Lentze N, Auerbach D, Schlattner U | title = Yeast two-hybrid, a powerful tool for systems biology | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 2763–88 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19582228 | pmc = 2705515 | doi = 10.3390/ijms10062763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gietz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gietz RD, Triggs-Raine B, Robbins A, Graham KC, Woods RA | title = Identification of proteins that interact with a protein of interest: applications of the yeast two-hybrid system | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 172 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 67–79 | date = July 1997 | pmid = 9278233 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006859319926 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/t5w6u8667583641p/?p=163f5ecf5cff441b940a429da9d83187&amp;pi=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system often utilizes a [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] strain of yeast in which the [[biosynthesis]] of certain nutrients (usually [[amino acid]]s or [[nucleic acid]]s) is lacking. When grown on media that lacks these nutrients, the yeast fail to survive. This mutant yeast strain can be made to incorporate foreign DNA in the form of [[plasmid]]s. In yeast two-hybrid screening, separate bait and prey plasmids are simultaneously introduced into the mutant yeast strain or a mating strategy is used to get both plasmids in one host cell.&lt;ref name="Auerbach"/&gt;

The second high-throughput approach is the library screening approach. In this set up the bait and prey harboring cells are mated in a random order. After mating and selecting surviving cells on selective medium the scientist will sequence the isolated plasmids to see which prey (DNA sequence) is interacting with the used bait. This approach has a lower rate of reproducibility and tends to yield higher amounts of false positives compared to the matrix approach.&lt;ref name="Auerbach"/&gt;

Plasmids are engineered to produce a protein product in which the DNA-binding domain (BD) fragment is fused onto a protein while another plasmid is engineered to produce a protein product in which the activation domain (AD) fragment is fused onto another protein. The protein fused to the BD may be referred to as the bait protein, and is typically a known protein the investigator is using to identify new binding partners. The protein fused to the AD may be referred to as the prey protein and can be either a single known protein or a [[Library (biology)|library]] of known or unknown proteins. In this context, a library may consist of a collection of protein-encoding sequences that represent all the proteins expressed in a particular organism or tissue, or may be generated by synthesising random DNA sequences.&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; Regardless of the source, they are subsequently incorporated into the protein-encoding sequence of a plasmid, which is then transfected into the cells chosen for the screening method.&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; This technique, when using a library, assumes that each cell is transfected with no more than a single plasmid and that, therefore, each cell ultimately expresses no more than a single member from the protein library.

If the bait and prey proteins interact (i.e., bind), then the AD and BD of the transcription factor are indirectly connected, bringing the AD in proximity to the transcription start site and transcription of reporter gene(s) can occur. If the two proteins do not interact, there is no transcription of the reporter gene. In this way, a successful interaction between the fused protein is linked to a change in the cell phenotype.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

The challenge of separating cells that express proteins that happen to interact with their counterpart fusion proteins from those that do not, is addressed in the following section.

==Fixed domains==

In any study, some of the protein domains, those under investigation, will be varied according to the goals of the study whereas other domains, those that are not themselves being investigated, will be kept constant. For example, in a two-hybrid study to select DNA-binding domains, the DNA-binding domain, BD, will be varied while the two interacting proteins, the bait and prey, must be kept constant to maintain a strong binding between the BD and AD. There are a number of domains from which to choose the BD, bait and prey and AD, if these are to remain constant. In protein–protein interaction investigations, the BD may be chosen from any of many strong DNA-binding domains such as [[Zif268]].&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; A frequent choice of bait and prey domains are residues 263–352 of yeast Gal11P with a N342V mutation&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; and residues 58–97 of yeast Gal4,&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; respectively. These domains can be used in both yeast- and bacterial-based selection techniques and are known to bind together strongly.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

The AD chosen must be able to activate transcription of the reporter gene, using the cell's own transcription machinery. Thus, the variety of ADs available for use in yeast-based techniques may not be suited to use in their bacterial-based analogues. The herpes simplex virus-derived AD, VP16 and yeast Gal4 AD have been used with success in yeast&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; whilst a portion of the α-subunit of ''E. coli'' RNA polymerase has been utilised in ''E. coli''-based methods.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt;

Whilst powerfully activating domains may allow greater sensitivity towards weaker interactions, conversely, a weaker AD may provide greater stringency.

==Construction of expression plasmids==

A number of engineered genetic sequences must be incorporated into the host cell to perform two-hybrid analysis or one of its derivative techniques. The considerations and methods used in the construction and delivery of these sequences differ according to the needs of the assay and the organism chosen as the experimental background.

There are two broad categories of hybrid library: random libraries and cDNA-based libraries. A [[cDNA library]] is constituted by the cDNA produced through [[reverse transcription]] of mRNA collected from specific cells of types of cell. This library can be ligated into a construct so that it is attached to the BD or AD being used in the assay.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; A random library uses lengths of DNA of random sequence in place of these cDNA sections. A number of methods exist for the production of these random sequences, including [[Site-directed mutagenesis#Cassette mutagenesis|cassette mutagenesis]].&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; Regardless of the source of the DNA library, it is [[DNA ligase|ligated]] into the appropriate place in the relevant plasmid/phagemid using the appropriate [[restriction endonucleases]].&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

===''E. coli''-specific considerations===

By placing the hybrid proteins under the control of [[IPTG]]-inducible [[lac promoter|''lac'' promoter]]s, they are expressed only on media supplemented with IPTG. Further, by including different antibiotic resistance genes in each genetic construct, the growth of non-transformed cells is easily prevented through culture on media containing the corresponding antibiotics. This is particularly important for counter selection methods in which a ''lack'' of interaction is needed for cell survival.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

The reporter gene may be inserted into the ''E. coli'' genome by first inserting it into an [[episome]], a type of plasmid with the ability to incorporate itself into the bacterial cell genome&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; with a copy number of approximately one per cell.&lt;ref name="whipple"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whipple FW | title = Genetic analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins in Escherichia coli | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 26 | issue = 16 | pages = 3700–6 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9685485 | pmc = 147751 | doi = 10.1093/nar/26.16.3700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hybrid expression phagemids can be electroporated into ''E. coli'' XL-1 Blue cells which after amplification and infection with VCS-M13 [[helper phage]], will yield a stock of library phage. These phage will each contain one single-stranded member of the phagemid library.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

==Recovery of protein information==

Once the selection has been performed, the [[primary structure]] of the proteins which display the appropriate characteristics must be determined. This is achieved by retrieval of the protein-encoding sequences (as originally inserted) from the cells showing the appropriate phenotype.

===''E. coli''===

The phagemid used to transform ''E. coli'' cells may be "rescued" from the selected cells by infecting them with VCS-M13 helper phage. The resulting phage particles that are produced contain the single-stranded phagemids and are used to infect XL-1 Blue cells.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; The double-stranded phagemids are subsequently collected from these XL-1 Blue cells, essentially reversing the process used to produce the original library phage. Finally, the DNA sequences are determined through [[dideoxy sequencing]].&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

==Controlling sensitivity==

The ''Escherichia coli''-derived [[TetR|Tet-R]] repressor can be used in line with a conventional reporter gene and can be controlled by tetracycline or doxicycline (Tet-R inhibitors). Thus the expression of Tet-R is controlled by the standard two-hybrid system but the Tet-R in turn controls (represses) the expression of a previously mentioned reporter such as ''HIS3'', through its Tet-R promoter. Tetracycline or its derivatives can then be used to regulate the sensitivity of a system utilising Tet-R.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

Sensitivity may also be controlled by varying the dependency of the cells on their reporter genes. For example, this may be affected by altering the concentration of histidine in the growth medium for ''his3''-dependent cells and altering the concentration of streptomycin for ''aadA'' dependent cells.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; Selection-gene-dependency may also be controlled by applying an inhibitor of the selection gene at a suitable concentration. [[3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole]] (3-AT) for example, is a competitive inhibitor of the ''HIS3''-gene product and may be used to titrate the minimum level of ''HIS3'' expression required for growth on histidine-deficient media.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

Sensitivity may also be modulated by varying the number of operator sequences in the reporter DNA.

==Non-fusion proteins==

A third, non-fusion protein may be co-expressed with two fusion proteins. Depending on the investigation, the third protein may modify one of the fusion proteins or mediate or interfere with their interaction.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

Co-expression of the third protein may be necessary for modification or activation of one or both of the fusion proteins. For example, ''S. cerevisiae'' possesses no endogenous tyrosine kinase. If an investigation involves a protein that requires tyrosine phosphorylation, the kinase must be supplied in the form of a tyrosine kinase gene.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

The non-fusion protein may mediate the interaction by binding both fusion proteins simultaneously, as in the case of ligand-dependent receptor dimerization.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

For a protein with an interacting partner, its functional homology to other proteins may be assessed by supplying the third protein in non-fusion form, which then may or may not compete with the fusion-protein for its binding partner. Binding between the third protein and the other fusion protein will interrupt the formation of the reporter expression activation complex and thus reduce reporter expression, leading to the distinguishing change in phenotype.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

==Split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid==

One limitation of classic yeast two-hybrid screens is that they are limited to soluble proteins. It is therefore impossible to use them to study the protein–protein interactions between insoluble [[integral membrane protein]]s. The split-ubiquitin system provides a method for overcoming this limitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stagljar I, Korostensky C, Johnsson N, te Heesen S | title = A genetic system based on split-ubiquitin for the analysis of interactions between membrane proteins in vivo | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 9 | pages = 5187–92 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9560251 | pmc = 20236 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.9.5187 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9560251 | bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.5187S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the split-ubiquitin system, two integral membrane proteins to be studied are fused to two different [[ubiquitin]] moieties: a C-terminal ubiquitin moiety ("Cub", residues 35–76) and an N-terminal ubiquitin moiety ("Nub", residues 1–34). These fused proteins are called the bait and prey, respectively. In addition to being fused to an integral membrane protein, the Cub moiety is also fused to a [[transcription factor]] (TF) that can be cleaved off by ubiquitin specific [[protease]]s. Upon bait–prey interaction, Nub and Cub-moieties assemble, reconstituting the split-ubiquitin. The reconstituted split-ubiquitin molecule is recognized by ubiquitin specific proteases, which cleave off the transcription factor, allowing it to induce the transcription of [[reporter gene]]s.&lt;ref name="Snider2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snider J, Kittanakom S, Curak J, Stagljar I | title = Split-ubiquitin based membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) system: a powerful tool for identifying protein-protein interactions | journal = Journal of Visualized Experiments | issue = 36 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20125081 | pmc = 2818708 | doi = 10.3791/1698 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fluorescent two-hybrid assay ==
Zolghadr and co-workers presented a fluorescent two-hybrid system that uses two hybrid proteins that are fused to different fluorescent proteins as well as LacI, the [[lac repressor]]. The structure of the fusion proteins looks like this: FP2-LacI-bait and FP1-prey where the bait and prey proteins interact and bring the fluorescent proteins (FP1 = [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]], FP2=[[mCherry]]) in close proximity at the binding site of the LacI protein in the host cell genome.&lt;ref name="Zolghadr2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zolghadr K, Mortusewicz O, Rothbauer U, Kleinhans R, Goehler H, Wanker EE, Cardoso MC, Leonhardt H | title = A fluorescent two-hybrid assay for direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 2279–87 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18622019 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M700548-MCP200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system can also be used to screen for inhibitors of protein–protein interactions.&lt;ref name="Yurlova2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yurlova L, Derks M, Buchfellner A, Hickson I, Janssen M, Morrison D, Stansfield I, Brown CJ, Ghadessy FJ, Lane DP, Rothbauer U, Zolghadr K, Krausz E | title = The fluorescent two-hybrid assay to screen for protein-protein interaction inhibitors in live cells: targeting the interaction of p53 with Mdm2 and Mdm4 | journal = Journal of Biomolecular Screening | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 516–25 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24476585 | doi = 10.1177/1087057113518067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enzymatic two-hybrid systems: KISS ==
While the original Y2H system used a reconstituted transcription factor, other systems create enzymatic activities to detect PPIs. For instance, the KInase Substrate Sensor ("KISS"), is a mammalian two-hybrid approach has been designed to map intracellular PPIs. Here, a bait protein  is fused to a [[kinase]]-containing portion of [[TYK2]] and a prey is coupled to a [[gp130]] [[cytokine receptor]] fragment. When bait and prey interact, TYK2 phosphorylates [[STAT3]] docking sites on the prey chimera, which ultimately leads to activation of a [[reporter gene]].&lt;ref name="Lievens2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lievens S, Gerlo S, Lemmens I, De Clercq DJ, Risseeuw MD, Vanderroost N, De Smet AS, Ruyssinck E, Chevet E, Van Calenbergh S, Tavernier J | title = Kinase Substrate Sensor (KISS), a mammalian in situ protein interaction sensor | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 13 | issue = 12 | pages = 3332–42 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25154561 | pmc = 4256487 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M114.041087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==One-, three- and one-two-hybrid variants==

===One-hybrid===

The one-hybrid variation of this technique is designed to investigate [[protein–DNA interaction]]s and uses a single fusion protein in which the AD is linked directly to the binding domain. The binding domain in this case however is not necessarily of fixed sequence as in two-hybrid protein–protein analysis but may be constituted by a library. This library can be selected against the desired target sequence, which is inserted in the promoter region of the reporter gene construct. In a positive-selection system, a binding domain that successfully binds the UAS and allows transcription is thus selected.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

Note that selection of DNA-binding domains is not necessarily performed using a one-hybrid system, but may also be performed using a two-hybrid system in which the binding domain is varied and the bait and prey proteins are kept constant.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt;

===Three-hybrid===

[[Image:Three-hybrid-system.svg|thumb|350px|Overview of three-hybrid assay.]]

RNA-protein interactions have been investigated through a three-hybrid variation of the two-hybrid technique. In this case, a hybrid RNA molecule serves to adjoin together the two protein fusion domains—which are not intended to interact with each other but rather the intermediary RNA molecule (through their RNA-binding domains).&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; Techniques involving non-fusion proteins that perform a similar function, as described in the 'non-fusion proteins' section above, may also be referred to as three-hybrid methods.

===One-two-hybrid===

Simultaneous use of the one- and two-hybrid methods (that is, simultaneous protein–protein and protein–DNA interaction) is known as a one-two-hybrid approach and expected to increase the stringency of the screen.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

==Host organism==

Although theoretically, any living cell might be used as the background to a two-hybrid analysis, there are practical considerations that dictate which is chosen. The chosen cell line should be relatively cheap and easy to culture and sufficiently robust to withstand application of the investigative methods and reagents.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; The latter is especially important for doing [[High-throughput screening|high-throughput studies]]. Therefore the yeast ''S. cerevisiae'' has been the main host organism for two-hybrid studies. However it is not always the ideal system to study interacting proteins from other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stynen B, Tournu H, Tavernier J, Van Dijck P | title = Diversity in genetic in vivo methods for protein-protein interaction studies: from the yeast two-hybrid system to the mammalian split-luciferase system | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 331–82 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22688816 | pmc = 3372256 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.05021-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeast cells often do not have the same post translational modifications, have a different codon use or lack certain proteins that are important for the correct expression of the proteins. To cope with these problems several novel two-hybrid systems have been developed. Depending on the system used agar plates or specific growth medium is used to grow the cells and allow selection for interaction. The most common used method is the agar plating one where cells are plated on selective medium to see of interaction takes place. Cells that have no interaction proteins should not survive on this selective medium.&lt;ref name="Brückner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamdi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamdi A, Colas P | title = Yeast two-hybrid methods and their applications in drug discovery | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–18 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22130009 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2011.10.008 | url = http://www.cell.com/trends/pharmacological-sciences/abstract/S0165-6147(11)00195-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''S. cerevisiae''===

The yeast ''S. cerevisiae'' was the model organism used during the two-hybrid technique's inception. It is commonly known as the Y2H system. It has several characteristics that make it a robust organism to host the interaction, including the ability to form tertiary protein structures, neutral internal pH, enhanced ability to form disulfide bonds and reduced-state glutathione among other cytosolic buffer factors, to maintain a hospitable internal environment.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; The yeast model can be manipulated through non-molecular techniques and its complete genome sequence is known.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; Yeast systems are tolerant of diverse culture conditions and harsh chemicals that could not be applied to mammalian tissue cultures.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

A number of yeast strains have been created specifically for Y2H screens, e.g. [[Y187]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fromont-Racine M, Rain JC, Legrain P | title = Toward a functional analysis of the yeast genome through exhaustive two-hybrid screens | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 277–82 | date = July 1997 | pmid = 9207794 | doi = 10.1038/ng0797-277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[AH109]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu L, Horstmann H, Ng C, Hong W | title = Regulation of Golgi structure and function by ARF-like protein 1 (Arl1) | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 114 | issue = Pt 24 | pages = 4543–55 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11792819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both produced by [[Takara Holdings|Clontech]].  Yeast strains R2HMet and BK100 have also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khadka S, Vangeloff AD, Zhang C, Siddavatam P, Heaton NS, Wang L, Sengupta R, Sahasrabudhe S, Randall G, Gribskov M, Kuhn RJ, Perera R, LaCount DJ | title = A physical interaction network of dengue virus and human proteins | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = M111.012187 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 21911577 | pmc = 3237087 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M111.012187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Candida albicans''===

[[Candida albicans|''C. albicans'']] is a yeast with a particular feature: it translates the CUG codon into serine rather than leucine. Due to this different codon usage it is difficult to use the model system ''S. cerevisiae'' as a Y2H to check for protein-protein interactions using ''C. albicans'' genes. To provide a more native environment a ''C. albicans'' two-hybrid (C2H) system was developed. With this system protein-protein interactions can be studied in ''C. albicans'' itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stynen B, Van Dijck P, Tournu H | title = A CUG codon adapted two-hybrid system for the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 38 | issue = 19 | pages = e184 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20719741 | pmc = 2965261 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkq725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent addition was the creation of a high-throughput system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schoeters |first1=Floris |last2=Munro |first2=Carol A. |last3=d’Enfert |first3=Christophe |last4=Van Dijck |first4=Patrick |last5=Mitchell |first5=Aaron P. |title=A High-Throughput                            Two-Hybrid System |journal=mSphere |date=22 August 2018 |volume=3 |issue=4 |doi=10.1128/mSphere.00391-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Legrand |first1=Mélanie |last2=Bachellier-Bassi |first2=Sophie |last3=Lee |first3=Keunsook K |last4=Chaudhari |first4=Yogesh |last5=Tournu |first5=Hélène |last6=Arbogast |first6=Laurence |last7=Boyer |first7=Hélène |last8=Chauvel |first8=Murielle |last9=Cabral |first9=Vitor |last10=Maufrais |first10=Corinne |last11=Nesseir |first11=Audrey |last12=Maslanka |first12=Irena |last13=Permal |first13=Emmanuelle |last14=Rossignol |first14=Tristan |last15=Walker |first15=Louise A |last16=Zeidler |first16=Ute |last17=Znaidi |first17=Sadri |last18=Schoeters |first18=Floris |last19=Majgier |first19=Charlotte |last20=Julien |first20=Renaud A |last21=Ma |first21=Laurence |last22=Tichit |first22=Magali |last23=Bouchier |first23=Christiane |last24=Van Dijck |first24=Patrick |last25=Munro |first25=Carol A |last26=d’Enfert |first26=Christophe |title=Generating genomic platforms to study Candida albicans pathogenesis |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |date=10 August 2018 |doi=10.1093/nar/gky747}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===''E. coli''===

Bacterial ''E. coli''-based two hybrid methods  (abbreviated as B2H) have several characteristics that may make them preferable to yeast-based homologues. The higher transformation efficiency and faster rate of growth lends ''E. coli'' to the use of larger libraries (in excess of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; A low false positive rate of approximately 3x10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;, the absence of requirement for a [[nuclear localisation signal]] to be included in the protein sequence and the ability to study proteins that would be toxic to yeast may also be major factors to consider when choosing an experimental background organism.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

It may be of note that the methylation activity of certain ''E. coli'' [[DNA methyltransferase]] proteins may interfere with some DNA-binding protein selections. If this is anticipated, the use of an ''E. coli'' strain that is defective for a particular methyltransferase may be an obvious solution.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; Important to mention is that bacteria are prokaryotic organisms and when studying eukaryotic protein-protein interactions (e.g. human proteins) the results need to be carefully approached.

===Mammalian cells===

In recent years a mammalian two hybrid (M2H) system has been designed to study mammalian protein-protein interactions in a cellular environment that closely mimics the native protein environment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/promega-notes/66/the-checkmatetm-mammalian-two-hybrid-system.pdf?la=en&lt;/ref&gt; Transiently transfected mammalian cells are used in this system to find protein-protein interactions.&lt;ref name="Feng"&gt;{{cite book

Using a mammalian cell line to study mammalian protein-protein interactions gives the advantage of working in a more native context.&lt;ref name="Luo"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luo Y, Batalao A, Zhou H, Zhu L | title = Mammalian two-hybrid system: a complementary approach to the yeast two-hybrid system | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 350–2 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9043710 | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00010/97222pf02_10525a.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The post-translational modifications, phosphorylation, acylation and glycosylation are similar. The intracellular localization of the proteins is also more correct compared to using a yeast two hybrid system.&lt;ref name="Buckholz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buckholz RG, Gleeson MA | title = Yeast systems for the commercial production of heterologous proteins | journal = Bio/Technology | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 1067–72 | date = November 1991 | pmid = 1367623 | doi = 10.1038/nbt1191-1067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible with the mammalian two-hybrid system to study signal inputs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/v5/n7/full/nsb0798_535.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Another big advantage is that results can be obtained within 48 hours after transfection.&lt;ref name="Luo"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luo Y, Batalao A, Zhou H, Zhu L | title = Mammalian two-hybrid system: a complementary approach to the yeast two-hybrid system | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 350–2 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9043710 | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00010/97222pf02_10525a.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Arabidopsis thaliana''===

In 2005 a two hybrid system in plants was developed. Using protoplasts of ''A. thaliana''  protein-protein interactions can be studied in plants. This way the interactions can be studied in their native context. In this system the GAL4 AD and BD are under the control of the strong 35S promoter. Interaction is measured using a GUS reporter. In order to enable a high-throughput screening the vectors were made gateway compatible.
The system is known as the protoplast two hybrid (P2H) system.&lt;ref name="Ehlert"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ehlert A, Weltmeier F, Wang X, Mayer CS, Smeekens S, Vicente-Carbajosa J, Dröge-Laser W | title = Two-hybrid protein-protein interaction analysis in Arabidopsis protoplasts: establishment of a heterodimerization map of group C and group S bZIP transcription factors | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 46 | issue = 5 | pages = 890–900 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16709202 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02731.x | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02731.x/epdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Aplysia californica''===

The sea hare [[California sea hare|''A californica'']] is a model organism in neurobiology to study among others the molecular mechanisms of long-term memory. To study interactions, important in neurology, in a more native environment a two-hybrid system has been developed in ''A californica'' neurons. A GAL4 AD and BD are used in this system.&lt;ref name="Choi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi JH, Lee JA, Yim SW, Lim CS, Lee CH, Lee YD, Bartsch D, Kandel ER, Kaang BK | title = Using an aplysia two-hybrid system to examine the interactions between transcription factors involved in long-term facilitation in the nervous system of aplysia | journal = Learning &amp; Memory | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–3 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12551962 | pmc = 196654 | doi = 10.1101/lm.55303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee JA, Lee SH, Lee C, Chang DJ, Lee Y, Kim H, Cheang YH, Ko HG, Lee YS, Jun H, Bartsch D, Kandel ER, Kaang BK | title = PKA-activated ApAF-ApC/EBP heterodimer is a key downstream effector of ApCREB and is necessary and sufficient for the consolidation of long-term facilitation | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 174 | issue = 6 | pages = 827–38 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16966424 | pmc = 2064337 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.200512066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bombyx mori''===

An insect two-hybrid (I2H) system was developed in  a silkworm cell line from the larva or caterpillar of the domesticated silk moth, ''[[Bombyx mori]]'' (BmN4 cells). This system uses the GAL4 BD and the activation domain of mouse NF-κB P65. Both are under the control of the OpIE2 promoter.&lt;ref name="Mon"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mon H, Sugahara R, Hong SM, Lee JM, Kamachi Y, Kawaguchi Y, Kusakabe T | title = Analysis of protein interactions with two-hybrid system in cultured insect cells | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 392 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–2 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19481053 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2009.05.033 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003269709003674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Determination of sequences crucial for interaction===

By changing specific amino acids by mutating the corresponding DNA base-pairs in the plasmids used, the importance of those amino acid residues in maintaining the interaction can be determined.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

After using bacterial cell-based method to select DNA-binding proteins, it is necessary to check the specificity of these domains as there is a limit to the extent to which the bacterial cell genome can act as a sink for domains with an affinity for other sequences (or indeed, a general affinity for DNA).&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

===Drug and poison discovery===

Protein–protein signalling interactions pose suitable therapeutic targets due to their specificity and pervasiveness. The random drug discovery approach uses compound banks that comprise random chemical structures, and requires a high-throughput method to test these structures in their intended target.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamdi"/&gt;

The cell chosen for the investigation can be specifically engineered to mirror the molecular aspect that the investigator intends to study and then used to identify new human or animal therapeutics or anti-pest agents.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamdi"/&gt;

===Determination of protein function===

By determination of the interaction partners of unknown proteins, the possible functions of these new proteins may be inferred.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; This can be done using a single known protein against a library of unknown proteins or conversely, by selecting from a library of known proteins using a single protein of unknown function.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

===Zinc finger protein selection===

To select [[zinc finger proteins]] (ZFPs) for [[protein engineering]], methods adapted from the two-hybrid screening technique have been used with success.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; A ZFP is itself a DNA-binding protein used in the construction of custom DNA-binding domains that bind to a desired DNA sequence.&lt;ref name="gommans"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gommans WM, Haisma HJ, Rots MG | title = Engineering zinc finger protein transcription factors: the therapeutic relevance of switching endogenous gene expression on or off at command | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 354 | issue = 3 | pages = 507–19 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16253273 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2005.06.082 | url = http://www.rug.nl/farmacie/onderzoek/basiseenheden/therapeuticgenemodulation/publicaties/publicaties2004/!find?path=/farmacie/onderzoek/basisEenheden/THErapeuticGeneModulation/publicaties/publicaties2004/2005_6.pdf&amp;params=as=pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By using a selection gene with the desired target sequence included in the UAS, and randomising the relevant amino acid sequences to produce a ZFP library, cells that host a DNA-ZFP interaction with the required characteristics can be selected. Each ZFP typically recognises only 3–4 base pairs, so to prevent recognition of sites outside the UAS, the randomised ZFP is engineered into a 'scaffold' consisting of another two ZFPs of constant sequence. The UAS is thus designed to include the target sequence of the constant scaffold in addition to the sequence for which a ZFP is selected.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt;

A number of other DNA-binding domains may also be investigated using this system.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

==Strengths==

*Two-hybrid screens are low-tech; they can be carried out in any lab without sophisticated equipment.
*Two-hybrid screens can provide an important first hint for the identification of interaction partners.
*The assay is scalable, which makes it possible to screen for interactions among many proteins. Furthermore, it can be automated, and by using robots many proteins can be screened against thousands of potentially interacting proteins in a relatively short time. Two types of large screens are used: the library approach and the matrix approach.
*Yeast two-hybrid data can be of similar quality to data generated by the alternative approach of [[coaffinity purification]] followed by [[mass spectrometry]] (AP/MS).&lt;ref name="yu"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu H, Braun P, Yildirim MA, Lemmens I, Venkatesan K, Sahalie J, Hirozane-Kishikawa T, Gebreab F, Li N, Simonis N, Hao T, Rual JF, Dricot A, Vazquez A, Murray RR, Simon C, Tardivo L, Tam S, Svrzikapa N, Fan C, de Smet AS, Motyl A, Hudson ME, Park J, Xin X, Cusick ME, Moore T, Boone C, Snyder M, Roth FP, Barabási AL, Tavernier J, Hill DE, Vidal M | title = High-quality binary protein interaction map of the yeast interactome network | journal = Science | volume = 322 | issue = 5898 | pages = 104–10 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18719252 | pmc = 2746753 | doi = 10.1126/science.1158684 | bibcode = 2008Sci...322..104Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Auerbach"/&gt;

==Weaknesses==
*The main criticism applied to the yeast two-hybrid screen of protein–protein interactions are the possibility of a high number of false positive (and false negative) identifications. The exact rate of false positive results is not known, but earlier estimates were as high as 70%. This also, partly, explains the often found very small overlap in results when using a (high throughput) two-hybrid screening, especially when using different experimental systems.&lt;ref name="Auerbach"&gt;{{cite book
|vauthors=Auerbach D, Stagljar I|title=Yeast Two-Hybrid Protein-Protein Interaction Networks
|volume=3
|pages=19–31
|year=2005
|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F0-387-24532-4_2
|doi=10.1007/0-387-24532-4_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deane"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deane CM, Salwiński Ł, Xenarios I, Eisenberg D | title = Protein interactions: two methods for assessment of the reliability of high throughput observations | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | pages = 349–56 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12118076 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M100037-MCP200 | url = http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/1/5/349 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reason for this high error rate lies in the characteristics of the screen:
*Certain assay variants overexpress the fusion proteins which may cause unnatural protein concentrations that lead to unspecific (false) positives.
*The hybrid proteins are fusion proteins; that is, the fused parts may inhibit certain interactions, especially if an interaction takes place at the N-terminus of a test protein (where the DNA-binding or activation domain is typically attached).
*An interaction may not happen in yeast, the typical host organism for Y2H. For instance, if a bacterial protein is tested in yeast, it may lack a chaperone for proper folding that is only present in its bacterial host. Moreover, a [[mammalian]] protein is sometimes not correctly modified in yeast (e.g., missing [[phosphorylation]]), which can also lead to false results.
*The Y2H takes place in the nucleus. If test proteins are not localized to the nucleus (because they have other localization signals) two interacting proteins may be found to be non-interacting.
*Some proteins might specifically interact when they are co-expressed in the yeast, although in reality they are never present in the same cell at the same time. However, in most cases it cannot be ruled out that such proteins are indeed expressed in certain cells or under certain circumstances.

Each of these points alone can give rise to false results. Due to the combined effects of all error sources yeast two-hybrid have to be interpreted with caution. The probability of generating false positives means that all interactions should be confirmed by a high confidence assay, for example [[co-immunoprecipitation]] of the endogenous proteins, which is difficult for large scale protein–protein interaction data. Alternatively, Y2H data can be verified using multiple Y2H variants&lt;ref name="Chen2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen YC, Rajagopala SV, Stellberger T, Uetz P | title = Exhaustive benchmarking of the yeast two-hybrid system | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = 667–8; author reply 668 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20805792 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/nmeth0910-667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or bioinformatics techniques. The latter test whether interacting proteins are expressed at the same time, share some common features (such as [[gene ontology]] annotations or certain [[network topologies]]), have homologous interactions in other species.&lt;ref name="Koegl2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koegl M, Uetz P | title = Improving yeast two-hybrid screening systems | journal = Briefings in Functional Genomics &amp; Proteomics | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 302–12 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18218650 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/bfgp/elm035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4369">'''Universal Accounting Center (UA)''' is a [[Privately owned enterprise|privately owned]] training organization located in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].  Founded in 1979, they offer self-paced [[Home study course|home-study courses]] in [[accounting]], [[bookkeeping]], [[tax preparation]], [[QuickBooks]] and [[marketing]] that specializes in [[small business]].

==History==
Universal Accounting was established in 1979.  The training center was founded as Universal Training Systems by Alf Bostrom with the purpose to teach students full-charge bookkeeping and accounting.  It first functioned under the parent company Metropolitan Business Bureau (MBB) which Alf began as a [[Financial consultant|financial consulting]] firm in 1960.  Through his experience with MBB, Alf established the [[business model]] upon which Universal Accounting would be built. Until quite recently, Universal Accounting was run by Alf’s son, [[Allen Bostrom]].

Universal Training Systems initially followed a [[classroom]]-based learning model, and the first Universal classroom was opened in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Shortly thereafter, several school locations in [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]] were opened and franchised.

In 1992, Alf’s sons, Allen and Ken Bostrom, joined his staff, and in 1994, Alf retired, and Allen Bostrom became president and [[CEO]] of the newly named Universal Accounting Center. The school has evolved from offering local live courses to developing and selling home-based study materials for bookkeeping, accounting, tax preparation, QuickBooks and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upgrade.slco.org/upAndComing/UaC008.html] Upgrade.com "Teaching Basics Propels Company to Inc. 500 List."&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1st, 2014, Roger Knecht became UAC's new president and CEO; Allen Bostrom remains as the chair of Universal's Board of Directors.

==Accreditation==
Universal Accounting has been approved by the California Tax Education Council (CTEC) to offer the Professional Tax Preparer Certification (PTP) as a [[distance learning]] course in the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enewschannels.com/2006/11/09/enc381_012629.php] Berg, Tabitha (2006-11-09).“Universal Accounting Center Tax Education Approved by California.” eNewsChannels.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Continuing professional development|Continuing Professional Education]] (CPE) credits are awarded for each of Universal’s training programs.  UA has also been accredited by the [[Better Business Bureau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbb.org/utah/business-reviews/business-vocational-schools/universal-accounting-center-in-salt-lake-city-ut-89110024] BBB.org "BBB Reliability Report for Universal Accounting Center."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards &amp; Honors==
Universal Accounting has ranked for the top 100 fastest growing businesses in Utah since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.highbeam.com/6000/article-1P2-7297458/top-] "The Top 100."  ''Deseret News'' on HighBeam.com&lt;/ref&gt; Universal Accounting also made Inc. 500’s list of America’s fastest growing private companies for 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inc.com/inc5000/2007/company-profile.html?id=200718270] “No. 1,1827: Universal Accounting Center.”  Inc.com&lt;/ref&gt; 2008, and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inc.com/inc5000/2009/company-profile.html?id=200944250] “Company Profile, No. 4,425: Universal Accounting Center.”  Inc.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Allen Bostrom served as [[keynote speaker]] at the 2009 Canadian Bookkeepers Association Conference.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Alice Bailey#Esoteric healing|Esoteric healing]] beliefs are based on the occult teachings of early 20th century theosophist [[Alice A. Bailey]].&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leser|first1=David|title=The Da Vinci Mode|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/the-da-vinci-mode-20120819-24h50|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=August 25, 2012|location=Australia|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=Alice A.|title=Esoteric Healing Vol IV (A Treatise on the Seven Rays)|date=1953|publisher=Lucifer Press/Lucis Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serge Benhayon has claimed to be the reincarnation of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and [[Pythagoras]]&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; as well as Alice A. Bailey, [[Imhotep]] and [[Saint Peter]]. He has written that Leonardo da Vinci is a "Claimed Son of God"&lt;ref name="TelegraphBullied"/&gt; and teaches that he is connected energetically to an ancient lineage of "living wisdom", and more "High [[Ascended master#Origins|Initiates]]" and Claimed Sons of God will reincarnate "over and over again until each and every single human is united as one, by their true light". Benhayon also claims that his daughter, Simone, a swimming teacher, is the reincarnation of [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PrivateEye"&gt;{{cite news|title=Quacks in the system|date=February 7, 2014|work=[[Private Eye]]|issue=1359|location=UK|pages=33|lay-url=https://archive.fo/249hg/c7fdb1f96c488d5b46c5de2968a8142c7fe3652b.jpg|lay-source=as printed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serge Benhayon devised Universal Medicine's healing practices based on the belief that disease is caused by energetic disharmony resulting from ill choices made in this and previous lifetimes. Benhayon teaches that there are two types of energy: [[prana]] ({{lang-sa2|प्राण}}, {{IAST|prāṇa}}; [[Sanskrit]] for [[Energy (esotericism)|life force]]) and fire.&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode"/&gt; Most forms of established wisdom, knowledge and belief, as well as most music and certain foods are believed to contain prana, which he regards as evil.&lt;ref name="MOprana"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.medicalobserver.com.au/news/concerns-raised-over-prana-treatment|title=Concerns raised over 'prana' treatment|author=.|date=July 30, 2012|work=The Medical Observer|accessdate=February 1, 2015|location=Australia|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prana is to be rejected or cleared to be replaced with "fiery energy" which emanates from the "Atmic womb of God". Universal Medicine healing modalities and products, including teas, herbal elixirs, creams and laminated healing symbol postcards, aim to clear prana.&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;

Benhayon teaches that people who abuse their authority, such as dictators and corrupt politicians, are reincarnated as children with disabilities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/disabled-jibe-appalling-former-mayor-slams-healer/3564026/|title=Disabled jibe 'appalling': Former mayor slams UM 'healer'|last=Turner|first=Liana|date=November 1, 2018|work=Northern Star|language=en|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims disabilities such as [[Autism]] and [[Down syndrome]] are karma for past life sins. He has also controversially stated on many occasions that sexual abuse, including that towards children, is karma from past lives and the universe attempting to stop a person from continuing to make non-loving choices.&lt;ref name="TelegraphBullied"/&gt; He also teaches that illness is caused by the [[Spirit possession|possession]] of the body by evil spirits, and is reported to have told a terminally ill patient that an evil spirit had entered her liver and kidneys.&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode"/&gt;

Benhayon teaches that for western secular women "the ultimate rape is rejection".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On race he writes that skin color evolution was a conscious choice and that Asians chose yellow skin, "yellow signifies the intellect" and the "pursuit of a lighter complexion arose when [[Black skin|Black]] (sic) became erroneously identified with the [[Darkness#Religion|Darkness]] (sic)."&lt;ref name="TelegraphBullied"/&gt; He taught his followers that if their children misspent their inheritance, or if they set conditions on their donations to UM, their "kidney energy" could be harmed in the next life.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-05/universal-medicine-cult-preyed-on-cancer-victim-jury-finds/10381432|title='We've been vindicated': Relief as jury finds 'socially dangerous cult' preyed on cancer victim|last=Robertson|first=Josh|date=November 5, 2018|work=ABC News|publisher=abc.net.au|layurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0pa_da3_9Y|lay-source=TV video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics say Universal Medicine places unreasonable pressure on followers to adhere to a severely restricted diet and to avoid most exercise for fear those things might "infect their spiritual alignment" and lead to poor health.&lt;ref name="MOInsideUM" /&gt; After reviewing a diet chart from Universal Medicine, the Professor of Public Health at the University of Wollongong and former president of the Public Health Association of Australia Heather Yeatman said it was “a public health issue” when children were placed on such restrictive diets: “If a child is not having dairy or cereals they are likely to be low in energy intake and there could be the risk of stunting if children are not getting enough energy. It is critically important there is a balanced diet, especially at the weaning stage because it can impact overall growth and cognitive development. It’s a public health issue.” This came after the report of a baby of UM member parents was hospitalised due to diet-related illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/news-story/0bda4d34cca49375f852c4053fe4cc32|title=Court rules Universal Medicine founder is running a ‘harmful cult’|last1=Hansen|first1=Jane|date=October 21, 2018|work=The Sunday Telegraph|publisher=News Corp|subscription=y|lay-url=https://www.cultnews101.com/2018/10/court-rules-universal-medicine-founder.html|lay-source=republished}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Followers are reportedly told health problems result from wrongdoings in their past lives.&lt;ref name="MOinvestigation"/&gt; Cult Counselling Australia director Raphael Aron said his organisation had a researcher working full-time on Universal Medicine after counselling former clients who were concerned about its influence on their children.&lt;ref name="CourierMail"&gt;{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Josh|url=http://couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/esoteric-healer-serge-benhayon-plans-college-of-universal-medicine-in-goonellabah/story-e6freoof-1226474375480|title='Esoteric healer' Serge Benhayon plans College of Universal Medicine in Goonellabah|work=The Courier Mail|date=September 15, 2012|location=Brisbane|accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aron said CCA had also counselled breakaway followers, who were still "battling" to withdraw emotionally from the group&lt;ref name="NewsComAU" /&gt; and that:

Benhayon denies he or the group interfere in "the students" personal lives but detractors say relationships become impossible when everything from music to sex must be "Serge-approved".&lt;ref name="SMHabsurd"/&gt; Cult expert David Millikan was quoted as saying “[Mr Benhayon] knows what they should read, what they should wear, what they should eat, how they should exercise, what sort of sexual life they should have and so they end up in this closed world."&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-10/universal-medicine-emails-with-dying-cancer-patient-released/10474294|title=Universal Medicine follower's daughter releases private emails between mother and 'cult' leader|last1=Robertson|first1=Josh|date=November 10, 2018|work=ABC News|publisher=abc.net.au|lay-url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUl-Ze67VQU|lay-source=TV video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benhayon's "esoteric connective tissue therapy" is said to improve the patient's energy flow by "allowing the pulse of the lymphatic system to symbiotically correspond with the body's own ensheathing web". Prof. John Dwyer describes the existence of a lymphatic pulse as "utter nonsense".&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt; Universal Medicine also provides counselling services to parents, body awareness education workshops to young women&lt;ref name="MOYWCA" /&gt; as well as cardiosacral pulse and craniosacral readings.&lt;ref name="MOInsideUM" /&gt;

In November 2014 Universal Medicine's treatments were highlighted in a [[Parliament of New South Wales|NSW Parliamentary]] Inquiry report by the Health Care Complaints Committee which states:
:"While there is little anecdotal evidence to suggest actual harm caused by these treatments, concerns were raised that patients may forego seeking proper medical advice and care.

Serge Benhayon has responded to such accusations with assertions UM does not "interfere with medicine... We do not hold ourselves above medicine. We are super pro medicine."&lt;ref name="MOInsideUM"/&gt; Sydney paediatrician and "Baby Doc" author, Howard Chilton, has endorsed Benhayon as a "teacher of enormous integrity".

Benhayon confirmed the group held a "[[book burning]]"&lt;ref name="SMHherbal" /&gt; near [[Mullumbimby]] in 2009. Others reported it as "just like the ritual burning of books in Nazi Germany", where Benhayon's students were invited to throw their books onto the [[pyre]]. Most books burnt were on [[Chinese medicine]], [[kinesiology]], [[acupuncture]], [[homeopathy]] and other [[alternative healing]] modalities, all of which Benhayon had decreed "prana"&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode" /&gt; which he considers "evil".&lt;ref name="MOprana" /&gt;

Serge Benhayon confirms revenue from Universal Medicine provides a living for the whole of the extended Benhayon family. In 2016, he had a taxable income of more than $188,000, and his wife, Miranda, $176,000. Approximately $50,000 of his income came from the Universal Family Trust, which also distributed $129,593 to his daughter Natalie, approximately $100,000 to his son Michael, $59,812 to his son Curtis and a further $34,890 to Curtis' wife Isabella.

Universal Medicine is reported to have received a portion of AUD$709,493 federal funds to provide six public lectures and "counselling services to parents" under a Commonwealth grant scheme applied for by the [[YWCA]]. The Australian Government refused to fully release documents explaining how the funds were used, saying "YWCA raised objections… including that the information does not accurately reflect YWCA’s activities" and could "have an adverse effect on the YWCA by affecting its relationships with other entities and its reputation".&lt;ref name="MOYWCA"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaye|first=Byron|url=http://www.medicalobserver.com.au/news/government-blocks-ywca-documents|title=Government blocks YWCA documents|work=The Medical Observer|date=November 27, 2012|location=Australia|accessdate=January 11, 2015|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, twenty Universal Medicine adherents joined the Australian doctor's reform lobby group, the HPARA, en-mass causing turmoil and a split in the organisation. HPARA chair Dr John Stokes said the UM adherents, who "initially ... all seemed quite impressive and normal," unexpectedly began turning up to meetings and attempted to take over the organisation's social media accounts and board of directors without declaring their UM connections. "Some of them behaved in ways that made me feel quite uncomfortable, where they would come into my personal space," he recalled. Dr Stokes said there were concerns of reprisals and potential legal threats from the UM group, and that he and others expressed concern at HPARA being associated with the cult, but is now confident that no member with links to UM remains in the HPARA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/ahpra-lobby-group-distances-itself-universal-medicine|title=AHPRA lobby group distances itself from Universal Medicine|last=O'Rourke|first=Geir|last2=Smith|first2=Paul|date=October 24, 2018|website=Australian Doctor|publication-place=Sydney NSW|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] in April 2018 revealed that [[The University of Queensland]] was investigating conflicts of interest of three of its faculty who were "acolytes" advocating for Universal Medicine. Video allegedly shows four researchers, two of whom are doctors, publicly advocating UM practices. Two more of the nine are presenters for the College of Universal Medicine. [[John Dwyer (medicine)|Professor John Dywer]] stated that: "[They] have let the university down badly in their fervour for promoting the benefits of Universal Medicine's approach to treatments, which have no basis in science, couldn't possibly be effective, and really represent a pre-scientific approach to how the body works and interacts with God and the universe". After receiving a 12-page letter from a third party whistleblower ''The [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]'' (JMIR) raised "serious concerns" as to the conflict of interest of the authors of the UM related articles it published. The editorial director stated that: "the omission of this conflict of interest, which appears to be highly significant in this case, is a clear violation of our policies"&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/international/uq-researchers-accused-of-promoting-dangerous-cult/9663184|title='Cult' Universal medicine practices promoted by researchers, UQ launches investigation|last=Robertson|first=Josh|date=April 16, 2018|work=ABC News|access-date=May 3, 2018|publisher=abc.net.au|layurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCgY9voDJqM|lay-source=TV video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.doctorportal.com.au/mjainsight/2018/16/the-researchers-the-university-and-the-bizarre-medical-cult/|title=The researchers, the university and the bizarre medical cult|last=Wilcken|first=Hugo|date=April 30, 2018|website=MJA InSight 16|publisher=AMPCo (Australian Medical Association)|language=en|access-date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested both articles published in the JMIR should be retracted. JMIR was also "very concerned" when it was revealed that the "original results paper contained large statistical errors inflating the effect sizes" and concluded "the proposed and executed research does not provide any evidence that any Universal Medicine modalities are effective in making people healthier". When the original peer-reviewers of the papers were made aware of the extensive conflicts of interest, they stated they would not have accepted the manuscripts had they been aware of this fact upon submission.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JMIR Editorial Office|date=May 11, 2018|title=Expression of Editorial Concern, Correction of Conflict of Interest and Affiliation, and Data Corrections|url=http://publichealth.jmir.org/2018/2/e53/|journal=JMIR Public Health and Surveillance|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=e53|doi=10.2196/publichealth.9932|issn=2369-2960|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018 Universal Medicine was compelled to cancel all their event and hire bookings with [[Ballina Shire Council]], including the Girl to Woman Festival, only days prior to the festival being debated in council chambers. UM took this action after 1,000 people had signed a petition to have the Girl to Woman event barred from [[Lennox Head]] Cultural Centre, and also to avoid becoming embroiled in a council policy motion that adopted child protection measures for future events and hiring "where the Council believes that provision of the service would pose a potential for child abuse". Council's amended policies concerning hiring and the tightening of child protection measures (not mentioning UM or the girl festival) were adopted, but not before UM had publicly criticised council's actions and long-term UM student and advocate Rebecca Asquith (Baldwin)&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; appeared at the council meeting on behalf of the festival urging councillors to oppose the motion.&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.echo.net.au/2018/11/universal-medicine-cancels-event-bookings/|title=Universal Medicine cancels all event bookings|last=Shand|first=Asland|date=November 30, 2018|work=Echonetdaily|location=Byron bay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/council-adopts-child-protection-measures-for-event/3582731/|title=Council adopts child protection measures for events|last=Turner|first=Liana|date=November 22, 2018|work=Northern Star|subscription=y|lay-url=https://www.pressreader.com/australia/the-northern-star/20181123/281522227134747|lay-source=as printed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to this, NSW Minister for Health, [[Brad Hazzard]], issued a directive for NSW Health to halt all dealings with Universal Medicine after UM-linked individuals and businesses were found to be involved in the annual Positive Adolescent Sexual Health (PASH) conference. The youth health initiative is backed by the [[NSW Department of Health]] and aimed at teens aged 15 years and up.

== Australian medical authorities and Dr Samuel Kim ==

Following an investigation by the NSW Medical Council in 2017 a Universal Medicine advocate and affiliated doctor, Samuel Tae-Kyu Kim was reprimanded for referring a patient for esoteric lung massage and chakra puncture:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/doctor-found-guilty-over-referrals/3184226/|title=Doctor found guilty over referrals|last=Adams|first=Cathy|date=May 31, 2017|work=Northern Star|accessdate=June 1, 2017|publisher=News Corp|location=Lismore NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; "knowing there was insufficient evidence for their efficacy as treatments for Patient A’s lung condition."

The Council heard evidence from a Senior Specialst and thoracic physician, who stated:
:Universal Medicine "affects an attitude which conventional medicine abandoned in the 19th century and this heightens the need to clearly distinguish for patients the difference between conventional medicine and Universal Medicine. Particularly as it is unclear, given it is a relatively new organisation, how Universal Medicine’s training programs are accredited."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Dr Kim stood down from the [[Australian Medical Association]] Queensland council in May 2018 after ABC News investigated a second case of professional misconduct where he had shared the entire medical and medication records of a patient with Serge Benhayon without the patient's knowledge. The patient had criticised Universal Medicine in the media and Kim claims he obtained the patient’s verbal consent. The NSW Privacy Commissioner disagreed and found Dr Kim had breached Health Privacy Principles,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thelimbic.com/respiratory/thoracic-physician-stands-down-in-dispute-over-links-to-esoteric-group/|title=Thoracic physician stands down in dispute over ‘esoteric’ group|last=Hoffman|first=Tessa|date=May 3, 2018|work=The Limbic|access-date=May 4, 2018|publisher=thelimbic.com|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; violated the patients privacy and its report said it was "unclear ... why it was necessary for Dr Kim to provide such a summary of what appears to be Mr Martin's entire medical history to Mr Benhayon". Dr Shaun Rudd, the AMA Queensland chairman, said the council had "a robust conflict of interest policy and AMA Queensland has full confidence in Dr Kim's ability to serve as a councillor".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-02/doctor-gave-patient-medical-history-to-universal-medicine/9710412|title='Doctor who gave patient medical history to Universal Medicine 'cult' stands down from AMA|last=Robertson|first=Josh|date=May 2, 2018|work=ABC News|access-date=May 3, 2018|publisher=abc.net.au|layurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFLVBX4TSz4|lay-source=TV video}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim stated that he was a 'student' of Universal Medicine and an honorary advisor at Benhayon’s College of Universal Medicine, but had no financial interests in the organisation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Legal Issues ==
In December 2015 Benhayon appeared at the [[Supreme Court of NSW]] when his sizeable inheritance from the estate of devotee Judith McIntyre was challenged by her children. The breast cancer victim's estate was estimated to be worth $1.1 million, $600,000 of which was intended for Serge Benhayon. A further gift of $800,000 was given to Benhayon by McIntyre three days after executing her will. Justice James Stevenson declined to alter the distribution of the estate and issued a ruling stating that Ms McIntyre "appears to have carefully considered how she should dispose of her estate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/cancer-victims-children-lose-appeal-to-overturn-will-which-bequeathed-majority-of-11m-estate-to-healer/news-story/ebe4db1a431eec20a02844a35d6b9e9d|title=Cancer victim’s children lose appeal to overturn will which bequeathed majority of $1.1m estate to healer|last1=Dale|first1=Amy|date=December 29, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2017|publisher=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3376253/Children-woman-died-breast-cancer-left-majority-1-1million-estate-health-guru-fail-legal-bid-challenge-will.html|title=Court rejects bid by the two children of a woman who died of breast cancer to get a share of the million-dollar estate she left to a 'health guru' whose followers call him the 'new Messiah'|last1=Noble|first1=Freya|date=December 29, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2017|publisher=The Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to her death, UM followers had established themselves as Ms McIntyre's nurse, financial planner, the witness to her will, the lawyer who drafted it and its executor.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; In a later unrelated trial, a NSW Supreme Court jury found it was substantially true to say that Benhayon "preys on", "swindles" and "exploits cancer patients by targeting them to leave him bequests in their wills"&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/revealed-what-the-jury-said-about-socially-harmful/3553783/|title=REVEALED: What the jury said about 'socially harmful cult'|last=Turner|first=Liana|date=October 19, 2018|work=Northern Star|publisher=News Corp|subscription=y|lay-url=https://www.pressreader.com/similar/281724090530042|lay-source=as printed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; and that he exercised "undue influence" on Ms McIntyre to inherit the bulk of her million-dollar estate.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; 

Emails released by Ms McIntyre’s daughter, Sarah, that were written by Benhayon to her mother during the last few months of her life, claimed that her children were “trying to destabilise you, trying to evoke your sympathy", which was "an attack on the funds that will help The Hierarchy's work on Earth". Benhayon also warned her against publicly revealing donations because evil spirits known as "the Dark Lodge" could "cause serious harm" to donors.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In June 2018 Justice McCallum, of the Supreme Court of NSW, ordered Benhayon to produce photographs and videos of workshops or sessions that relate to the technique of “Deeper Femaleness” which display the “hands on” healing technique practiced by Universal Medicine. He was also ordered to produce a list of donations received, tax returns and other financial statements. The ruling comes as part of an ongoing defamation trial in which Benhayon is suing a blogger, Esther Rockett, for defamation.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://lawyerly.com.au/judge-orders-spiritual-guru-produce-pics-hands-healing/|title=Judge orders spiritual guru to produce pics of ‘hands on’ healing|last=Fredenburgh|first=Cat|date=June 21, 2018|work=Lawyerly|access-date=June 23, 2018|publisher=Lawyerly Media|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/spiritual-healer-serge-benhayon-gave-client-ovarian-reading-20180624-p4znf9.html|title=Spiritual healer Serge Benhayon gave client 'ovarian reading'|last=McClymont|first=Kate|date=June 24, 2018|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box

In 2015 Benhayon sued a blogger, Esther Rockett, for defamation in the Supreme Court of NSW over social media posts she had made which he said portray him as: delusional, dishonest, a sexual predator and the leader of a "socially harmful cult". Rockett described Benhayon as a “sleazebag guru” and accused him of performing a "sleazy ovarian reading" on her during a treatment session, inappropriately touching her, and engaging in inappropriate conduct towards women. Rockett argued the defences of truth and honest opinion in connection to her social media postings.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/spiritual-healer-serge-benhayon-not-a-cult-leader-court-20180904-p501mh.html|title=Spiritual healer Serge Benhayon 'not a cult leader': court|last1=Whitbourn|first1=Michaela|date=September 4, 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/self-styled-healer-serge-benhayon-leads-socially-harmful-cult-jury-20181010-p508ux.html|title=Self-styled healer Serge Benhayon leads 'socially harmful cult': jury|last1=Whitbourn|first1=Michaela|date=October 15, 2018|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 7 week trial, which began in September 2018, Benhayon described himself as a "teacher and practitioner" and also a "business owner". He said his teachings, which are offered as courses, were derived "from the tradition known as the ageless wisdom". He claimed the ageless wisdom had a "very strong lineage that includes the divine messengers", including Hermes, Plato, Pythagorasm, Jesus and Muhammad. He told the court that he "had an understanding", which was stronger than a belief, that in one of his many past lives he was Leonardo da Vinci&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; and Pythagoras&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;. Benhayon told Ms Rockett's barrister, Mr Molomby QC, that he could sense discarnate spirits in the courtroom who were nine feet tall, had no feet, and a "crevasse" where the nose was meant to be. He declined to count them and denied this was because he couldn't really feel their presence, saying "I could [count] if I wanted to but it's not something I practise and it's not something I'm allowed to do".&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/serge-benhayon-defamation-spirits-in-the-courtroom|title=This Faith Healer Suing For Defamation Says He's The Reincarnation Of Leonardo Da Vinci|last1=Sainty|first1=Lane|date=September 5, 2018|work=Buzzfeed News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Under cross-examination, Benhayon also stated that people who abused their authority, such as dictators and corrupt politicians, are reincarnated as disabled children. He agreed that during a Sacred Esoteric Healing course - level 1, that he had said that the Roman emperor Nero continues to reincarnate as an autistic child, while other authority abusers reincarnate as children with Down syndrome or other disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theherald.com.au/story/5630505/reincarnation-evidence-given-by-nsw-healer/|title=Reincarnation evidence given by NSW healer|last1=Scheikowski|first1=Margaret|date=September 6, 2018|work=Newcastle Herald|publisher=Australian Community Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four-person jury completed answers to 58 pages of questions, primarily in Ms Rockett's favour and against Mr Benhayon. They found it was substantially true to say he led a "socially harmful cult", made "bogus healing claims", "intentionally indecently touched" clients, and as Ms Rockett claimed, that there were "reasonable grounds to believe" Mr Benhayon intentionally sexually preyed upon her and other clients during treatment sessions. It was also found substantially true to say Mr Benhayon was the leader of Universal Medicine, "a group which to his knowledge makes false claims about healing that causes harm to others", that he had an "indecent interest in young girls as young as ten whom he causes to stay at his house unaccompanied",&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; "is guilty of inappropriate behaviour with children",&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; "is dishonest", "is sexually manipulative of his cult followers", and "has persuaded followers to shun loved ones who won’t join his cult".&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/jury-declares-universal-medicine-leader-exploitative-charlatan|title=Jury declares Universal Medicine leader an exploitative charlatan|last=Smith|first=Paul|last2=Wright|first2=Jocelyn|date=October 16, 2018|website=Australian Doctor|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other substantial truth findings by the jury were that he "vilifies people with disabilities", "exploited children by having them vouch for UM's dishonest healing practices",&lt;ref name="Byron_Echo" /&gt; "engages in bizarre sexual manipulation to make money for his business", "exploits cancer patients by targeting them to leave him bequests in their wills",&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/defamation-loss-for-universal-medicine-founder/3550048/|title=Spiritual healer 'leader of socially harmful cult': Jury|last=AAP|date=October 15, 2018|work=Northern Star|publisher=News Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/defamation-loss-for-nsw-spiritual-healer/news-story/ac8ef1934de9f0b26f474d27a2738b10?nk=a1e1a4580aa332c2cb6193e38afdfebd-1539593422|title=Defamation loss for NSW spiritual healer|last1=Scheikowski|first1=Margaret|date=October 15, 2018|work=The Australian|publisher=News Corp Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; "dishonestly promotes fraudulent ideas of karma for self-gain", "denigrates life and glorifies death"&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; and "is a hypocrite because his Esoteric Healing has death as its goal."&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The ''Northern Star'' also reported further substantial truth findings that "Serge Benhayon is the leader of a socially harmful cult that is paternalistic to women", "engages in inappropriate conduct towards women", "instructed students at Universal Medicine training workshops to touch the genitals of victims of sexual assault", "has engaged in bullying to stop Esther Rockett exposing that he is guilty of inappropriate behaviour with children" and "is not a fit person to hold a Working with Children Certificate".&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

The jury found allegations that Benhayon was "delusional",&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; had "a propensity to touch girls inappropriately", "groped the genitals of various women under the guise of treating them" or "instilled fear and guilt in children to get them to do his bidding"&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; were not substantially true or upheld, instead they were covered by Rockett's qualified privilege.&lt;ref name="Serge_Activity" /&gt; Serge Benhayon has denied all allegations of wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

== Other privacy and confidentiality issues ==

An ex-patient and [[Health Care Complaints Commission|HCCC]] complainant,&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph"/&gt; who was vilified on Universal Medicine websites said the organisation accuses "everyone else of [[cyberbullying]] while embarking on a systematic, online pack hunt". Numerous students of the organisation unknown to the complainant have openly disputed her medical conditions online. Benhayon has defended the group’s right to do so.&lt;ref name="TelegraphBullied"/&gt;

The former Queensland mental health commissioner was scathing of Universal Medicine after the UM "Facts Team" breached privacy and published an ex-UM client's full name, image and schizophrenia diagnosis online after he criticised them. Prior to the outing in 2018 the man had been anonymous. The former commissioner Lesley van Schoubroeck said:
:it is "entirely inappropriate for any organisation, particularly one purporting to be a health organisation, to publicly reveal identifying information of anyone's diagnosis, be it mental health or physical health" and "people with schizophrenia suffer stigma and discrimination in the workplace and in the community".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
When interviewed by the ABC the ex-client expressed concern about his future job prospects due to the privacy breach.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8526">In [[computational physics]], '''variational Monte Carlo (VMC)''' is a [[quantum Monte Carlo]] method that applies the [[Variational method (quantum mechanics)|variational method]] to approximate the [[ground state]] of a quantum system.

The basic building block is a generic [[wave function]] &lt;math&gt;| \Psi(a) \rangle &lt;/math&gt; depending on some parameters &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt;.  
The optimal values of the parameters &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is then found upon minimizing the total energy of the system.

In particular, given the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{H} &lt;/math&gt;, and denoting with &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; a [[Many-body problem|many-body]] configuration,  the [[expectation value]] of the energy can be written as :

&lt;math&gt; E(a) = \frac{\langle \Psi(a) | \mathcal{H} | \Psi(a) \rangle} {\langle \Psi(a) |  \Psi(a) \rangle } = \frac{\int | \Psi(X,a) | ^2 \frac{\mathcal{H}\Psi(X,a)}{\Psi(X,a)} \, dX} { \int | \Psi(X,a)|^2 \, dX}. &lt;/math&gt;

Following the [[Monte Carlo method]] for evaluating [[integral]]s, we can interpret &lt;math&gt; \frac{ | \Psi(X,a) | ^2 } { \int | \Psi(X,a) | ^2 \, dX } &lt;/math&gt; as a [[probability distribution]] function, sample it, and evaluate the energy expectation value &lt;math&gt; E(a) &lt;/math&gt; as the average of the so-called local energy &lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm{loc}}(X)  = \frac{\mathcal{H}\Psi(X,a)}{\Psi(X,a)} &lt;/math&gt;.  Once &lt;math&gt; E(a) &lt;/math&gt; is known for a given set of variational parameters &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt;, then optimization is performed in order to minimize the energy and obtain the best possible representation of the ground-state wave-function.

VMC is no different from any other variational method, except that the many-dimensional integrals are evaluated numerically.  Monte Carlo integration is particularly crucial in this problem since the dimension of the many-body Hilbert space, comprising all the possible values of the configurations &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;, typically grows exponentially with the size of the physical system. Other approaches to the numerical evaluation of the energy expectation values would therefore, in general, limit applications to much smaller systems than those analyzable thanks to the Monte Carlo approach.

The accuracy of the method then largely depends on the choice of the variational state. The simplest choice typically corresponds to a [[Mean field theory|mean-field]] form, where the state &lt;math&gt; \Psi &lt;/math&gt; is written as a factorization over the Hilbert space. This particularly simple form is typically not very accurate since it neglects many-body effects.  
One of the largest gains in accuracy over writing the wave function separably comes from the introduction of the so-called Jastrow factor. In this case the wave function is written as &lt;math&gt; \Psi(X) = \exp(\sum{u(r_{ij})})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; r_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; is the distance between a pair of quantum particles and &lt;math&gt; u(r) &lt;/math&gt; is a variational function to be determined.  
With this factor, we can explicitly account for particle-particle correlation, but the many-body integral becomes unseparable, so Monte Carlo is the only way to evaluate it efficiently.  In chemical systems, slightly more sophisticated versions of this factor can obtain 80&amp;ndash;90% of the correlation energy (see [[electronic correlation]]) with less than 30 parameters.  In comparison, a configuration interaction calculation may require around 50,000 parameters to reach that accuracy, although it depends greatly on the particular case being considered.  In addition, VMC usually scales as a small power of the number of particles in the simulation, usually something like ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt; for calculation of the energy expectation value, depending on the form of the wave function.

== Wave function optimization in VMC ==

QMC calculations crucially depend on the quality of the trial-function, and so it is essential to have an optimized wave-function as close as possible to the ground state.
The problem of function [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] is a very important research topic in numerical simulation. In QMC, in addition to the usual difficulties to find the minimum of multidimensional parametric function, the statistical noise is present in the estimate of the cost function (usually the energy), and its derivatives, required for an efficient optimization.

Different cost functions and different strategies were used to optimize a many-body trial-function. Usually three cost functions were used in QMC optimization energy, variance or a linear combination of them.  The variance optimization method has the advantage that the exact wavefunction's variance is known.  (Because the exact wavefunction is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian, the variance of the local energy is zero).  This means that variance optimization is ideal in that it is bounded by below, it is positive defined and its minimum is known.  Energy minimization may ultimately prove more effective, however, as different authors recently showed that the energy optimization is more effective than the variance one.

There are different motivations for this: first, usually one is interested in the lowest energy rather than in the lowest variance in both variational and diffusion Monte Carlo; second, variance optimization takes many iterations to optimize determinant parameters and often the optimization can get stuck in multiple local minimum and it suffers of the "false convergence" problem; third energy-minimized wave functions on average yield more accurate values of other expectation values than variance minimized wave functions do.

The optimization strategies can be divided into three categories. The first strategy is based on correlated sampling together with deterministic optimization methods. Even if this idea yielded very accurate results for the first-row atoms, this procedure can have problems if parameters affect the nodes, and moreover density ratio of the current and initial trial-function increases exponentially with the size of the system. In the second strategy one use a large bin to evaluate the cost function and its derivatives in such way that the noise can be neglected and deterministic methods can be used.

The third approach, is based on an iterative technique to handle directly with noise functions. The first example of these methods is the so-called Stochastic Gradient Approximation (SGA), that was used also for structure optimization. Recently an improved and faster approach of this kind was proposed the so-called Stochastic Reconfiguration (SR) method.
