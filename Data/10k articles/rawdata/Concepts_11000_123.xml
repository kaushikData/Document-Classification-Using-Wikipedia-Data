      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16190">In [[mathematics]], the '''Alexander polynomial''' is a [[knot invariant]] which assigns a [[polynomial]] with integer coefficients to each knot type.  [[James Waddell Alexander II]] discovered this, the first [[knot polynomial]], in 1923.  In 1969, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] showed a version of this polynomial, now called the '''Alexander–Conway polynomial''', could be computed using a [[skein relation]], although its significance was not realized until the discovery of the [[Jones polynomial]] in 1984.  Soon after Conway's reworking of the Alexander polynomial, it was realized that a similar skein relation was exhibited in Alexander's paper on his polynomial.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander describes his skein relation toward the end of his paper under the heading "miscellaneous theorems", which is possibly why it got lost.  [[Joan Birman]] mentions in her paper ''New points of view in knot theory'' (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 28 (1993), no. 2, 253–287) that Mark Kidwell brought her attention to Alexander's relation in 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Let ''K'' be a [[Knot (mathematics)|knot]] in the [[3-sphere]].  Let ''X'' be the infinite [[covering space|cyclic cover]] of the [[knot complement]] of ''K''.  This covering can be obtained by cutting the knot complement along a [[Seifert surface]] of ''K'' and gluing together infinitely many copies of the resulting manifold with boundary in a cyclic manner.  There is a [[deck transformation|covering transformation]] ''t'' acting on ''X''.  Consider the first homology (with integer coefficients) of ''X'', denoted &lt;math&gt;H_1(X)&lt;/math&gt;.  The transformation ''t'' acts on the homology and so we can consider &lt;math&gt;H_1(X)&lt;/math&gt; a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the ring of [[Laurent polynomial]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}[t, t^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;.  This is called the '''Alexander invariant''' or '''Alexander module'''.

The module is finitely presentable; a [[presentation matrix]] for this module is called the '''Alexander matrix'''.  If the number of generators, ''r'', is less than or equal to the number of relations, ''s'', then we consider the ideal generated by all ''r'' by ''r'' minors of the matrix; this is the zero'th [[Fitting ideal]] or '''Alexander ideal''' and does not depend on choice of presentation matrix.  If ''r &gt; s'', set the ideal equal to 0.  If the Alexander ideal is [[principal ideal|principal]], take a generator; this is called an Alexander polynomial of the knot.  Since this is only unique up to multiplication by the Laurent monomial &lt;math&gt;\pm t^n&lt;/math&gt;, one often fixes a particular unique form.  Alexander's choice of normalization is to make the polynomial have a positive [[constant term]].

Alexander proved that the Alexander ideal is nonzero and always principal.  Thus an Alexander polynomial always exists, and is clearly a knot invariant, denoted &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The Alexander polynomial for the knot configured by only one string is a polynomial of t&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and then it is the same polynomial for the mirror image knot. Namely, it can not distinguish between the knot and one for its mirror image.

==Computing the polynomial==
The following procedure for computing the Alexander polynomial was given by J. W. Alexander in his paper.

Take an [[oriented]] diagram  of the knot with ''n'' crossings; there are ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 regions of the knot diagram. To work out the Alexander polynomial, first one must create an [[incidence matrix]] of size (''n'', ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2).  The ''n'' rows correspond to the ''n'' crossings, and the ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 columns to the regions. The values for the matrix entries are either 0, 1, −1, ''t'', −''t''.

Consider the entry corresponding to a particular region and crossing. If the region is not adjacent to the crossing, the entry is 0. If the region is adjacent to the crossing, the entry depends on its location. The following table gives the entry, determined by the location of the region at the crossing from the perspective of the incoming undercrossing line.

: on the left before undercrossing: −''t''
: on the right before undercrossing: 1
: on the left after undercrossing: ''t''
: on the right after undercrossing: −1

Remove two columns corresponding to adjacent regions from the matrix, and work out the determinant of the new ''n'' by ''n'' matrix.  Depending on the columns removed, the answer will differ by multiplication by &lt;math&gt;\pm t^n&lt;/math&gt;.  To resolve this ambiguity, divide out the largest possible power of ''t'' and multiply by −1 if necessary, so that the constant term is positive.  This gives the Alexander polynomial.

The Alexander polynomial can also be computed from the [[Seifert matrix]].

After the work of J. W. Alexander, [[Ralph Fox]] considered a copresentation of the knot group &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(S^3\backslash K)&lt;/math&gt;, and introduced non-commutative differential calculus {{harvtxt|Fox|1961}}, which also permits one to compute &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Detailed exposition of this approach about higher Alexander polynomials can be found in the book {{harvtxt|Crowell|Fox|1963}}.

==Basic properties of the polynomial==

The Alexander polynomial is symmetric: &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t^{-1}) = \Delta_K(t)&lt;/math&gt; for all knots K.

: From the point of view of the definition, this is an expression of the [[Poincaré duality|Poincaré Duality isomorphism]] &lt;math&gt; \overline{H_1 X} \simeq \mathrm{Hom}_{\Bbb Z[t,t^{-1}]}(H_1 X, G) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of the field of fractions of &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z[t,t^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z[t,t^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;, considered as a &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z[t,t^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;-module, and where &lt;math&gt;\overline{H_1 X}&lt;/math&gt; is the conjugate &lt;math&gt;\Bbb Z[t,t^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;-module to &lt;math&gt;H_1 X&lt;/math&gt; ie: as an abelian group it is identical to &lt;math&gt;H_1 X&lt;/math&gt; but the covering transformation &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; acts by &lt;math&gt;t^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Furthermore, the Alexander polynomial evaluates to a unit on 1: &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(1)=\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;.

: From the point of view of the definition, this is an expression of the fact that the knot complement is a homology circle, generated by the covering transformation &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  More generally if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a 3-manifold such that &lt;math&gt;rank(H_1 M) = 1&lt;/math&gt; it has an Alexander polynomial &lt;math&gt;\Delta_M(t)&lt;/math&gt; defined as the order ideal of its infinite-cyclic covering space.  In this case &lt;math&gt;\Delta_M(1)&lt;/math&gt; is, up to sign, equal to the order of the torsion subgroup of &lt;math&gt;H_1 M&lt;/math&gt;.

It is known that every integral Laurent polynomial which is both symmetric and evaluates to a unit at 1 is the Alexander polynomial of a knot (Kawauchi 1996).

==Geometric significance of the polynomial==

Since the Alexander ideal is principal, &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t)=1&lt;/math&gt; [[if and only if]] the commutator subgroup of the knot group is [[perfect group|perfect]] (i.e. equal to its own [[commutator subgroup]]).

For a [[topologically slice]] knot, the Alexander polynomial satisfies the Fox–Milnor condition &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t) = f(t)f(t^{-1})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; is some other integral Laurent polynomial.

Twice the [[Seifert surface|knot genus]] is bounded below by the degree of the Alexander polynomial.

[[Michael Freedman]] proved that a knot in the 3-sphere is [[topologically slice]]; i.e., bounds a "locally-flat" topological disc in the 4-ball, if the Alexander polynomial of the knot is trivial (Freedman and Quinn, 1990).

{{harvtxt|Kauffman|1983}} describes the first construction of the Alexander polynomial via state sums derived from physical models. A survey of these topic and other connections with physics are given in {{harvtxt|Kauffman|2001}}.

There are other relations with surfaces and smooth 4-dimensional topology. For example, under certain assumptions, there is a way of modifying a smooth [[4-manifold]] by performing a [[surgery theory|surgery]] that consists of removing a neighborhood of a two-dimensional torus and replacing it with a knot complement crossed with ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The result is a smooth 4-manifold homeomorphic to the original, though now the [[Seiberg–Witten invariant]] has been modified by multiplication with the Alexander polynomial of the knot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv&lt;!-- Deny Citation Bot--&gt;|arxiv = dg-ga/9612014 |title = Knots, Links, and 4-Manifolds  |last1 = Fintushel|first1 = Ronald|last2 = Stern|first2 = Ronald J|year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knots with symmetries are known to have restricted Alexander polynomials. See the symmetry section in (Kawauchi 1996). Nonetheless, the Alexander polynomial can fail to detect some symmetries, such as strong invertibility.

If the [[knot complement]] fibers over the circle, then the Alexander polynomial of the knot is known to be ''monic'' (the coefficients of the highest and lowest order terms are equal to &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;). In fact, if &lt;math&gt;S \to C_K \to S^1&lt;/math&gt; is a fiber bundle where &lt;math&gt;C_K&lt;/math&gt; is the knot complement, let &lt;math&gt;g : S \to S&lt;/math&gt; represent the [[monodromy]], then &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t) = {\rm Det}(tI-g_*)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g_*\colon H_1 S \to H_1 S&lt;/math&gt; is the induced map on homology.

==Relations to satellite operations==

If a knot &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a [[satellite knot]] with pattern knot &lt;math&gt;K'&lt;/math&gt; (there exists an embedding &lt;math&gt;f : S^1 \times D^2 \to S^3&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K=f(K')&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S^1 \times D^2 \subset S^3&lt;/math&gt; is an unknotted solid torus containing &lt;math&gt;K'&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t) = \Delta_{f(S^1 \times \{0\})}(t^a) \Delta_{K'}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; is the integer that represents &lt;math&gt;K' \subset S^1 \times D^2&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;H_1(S^1\times D^2) = \mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;.

Examples: For a connect-sum &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{K_1 \# K_2}(t) = \Delta_{K_1}(t) \Delta_{K_2}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is an untwisted [[Satellite knot|Whitehead double]], then &lt;math&gt;\Delta_K(t)=\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Alexander–Conway polynomial==
Alexander proved the Alexander polynomial satisfies a skein relation.  [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] later rediscovered this in a different form and showed that the skein relation together with a choice of value on the unknot was enough to determine the polynomial.  Conway's version is a polynomial in ''z'' with integer coefficients, denoted &lt;math&gt;\nabla(z)&lt;/math&gt; and called the '''Alexander–Conway polynomial''' (also known as '''Conway polynomial''' or '''Conway–Alexander polynomial''').

Suppose we are given an oriented link diagram, where &lt;math&gt;L_+, L_-, L_0&lt;/math&gt; are link diagrams resulting from crossing and smoothing changes on a local region of a specified crossing of the diagram, as indicated in the figure.  [[Image:Skein (HOMFLY).svg|200px|center]]

Here are Conway's skein relations:

* &lt;math&gt;\nabla(O) = 1&lt;/math&gt; (where O is any diagram of the unknot)
* &lt;math&gt;\nabla(L_+) - \nabla(L_-) = z \nabla(L_0)&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship to the standard Alexander polynomial is given by &lt;math&gt;\Delta_L(t^2) = \nabla_L(t - t^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;.  Here &lt;math&gt;\Delta_L&lt;/math&gt; must be properly normalized (by multiplication of &lt;math&gt;\pm t^{n/2}&lt;/math&gt;) to satisfy the skein relation &lt;math&gt;\Delta(L_+) - \Delta(L_-) = (t^{1/2} - t^{-1/2}) \Delta(L_0)&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that this relation gives a Laurent polynomial in ''t&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;''.

See [[knot theory]] for an example computing the Conway polynomial of the trefoil.

==Relation to Floer homology==

Using pseudo-holomorphic curves, {{harvtxt|Ozsvath|Szabo|2004}} and {{harvtxt|Rasmussen|2003}} associated a bigraded abelian group, called knot Floer homology, to each isotopy class of knots. The graded [[Euler characteristic]] of knot Floer homology is the Alexander polynomial. While the Alexander polynomial gives a lower bound on the genus of a knot, {{harvtxt|Ozsvath|Szabo|2004b}} showed that knot Floer homology detects the genus. Similarly, while the Alexander polynomial gives an obstruction to a knot complement fibering over the circle, {{harvtxt|Ni|2007}} showed that knot Floer homology completely determines when a knot complement fibers over the circle. The knot Floer homology groups are part of the Heegaard Floer homology family of invariants; see [[Floer homology]] for further discussion.

'''Alternatives to evolution by natural selection''', also described as '''non-Darwinian mechanisms of evolution''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-Darwinian mechanisms of evolution and their authors|url=http://darwiniana.com/2012/02/24/non-darwinian-mechanisms-of-evolution-and-their-authors/|publisher=Darwiniana|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been proposed by scholars investigating biology since classical times to explain signs of [[evolution]] and the [[Homology (biology)|relatedness]] of different groups of living things. The alternatives in question do not encompass religious points of view such as young or old earth [[creationism]] or [[intelligent design]], but are limited to explanations proposed by biologists, though one was confusingly named 'theistic evolution' by [[Asa Gray]].

Where the fact of evolutionary change was accepted but the mechanism proposed by [[Charles Darwin]], [[natural selection]], was denied, explanations of evolution such as [[Lamarckism]], [[catastrophism]], [[orthogenesis]], [[vitalism]], [[structuralism (biology)|structuralism]] and [[mutationism]] (called saltationism before 1900) were entertained. Different factors motivated people to propose non-[[Darwinism|Darwinian]] mechanisms of evolution. Natural selection, with its emphasis on death and competition, did not appeal to some naturalists because they felt it immoral, leaving little room for [[Teleology in biology|teleology]] or the concept of progress in the development of life. Some who came to accept evolution, but disliked natural selection, raised religious objections. Others felt that evolution was an inherently progressive process that natural selection alone was insufficient to explain. Still others felt that nature, including the development of life, followed orderly patterns that natural selection could not explain.

By the start of the 20th century, evolution was generally accepted by biologists but [[eclipse of Darwinism|natural selection was in eclipse]].{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=246–281}} Many alternative theories were proposed, but biologists were quick to discount theories such as orthogenesis, vitalism and Lamarckism which offered no mechanism for evolution. Mutationism did propose a mechanism, but it was not generally accepted. The [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] a generation later claimed to sweep away all the alternatives to Darwinian evolution, though some have been revived as molecular mechanisms for them have been discovered.

==Unchanging forms==
{{main|Hylomorphism|Great chain of being}}

[[Aristotle]] did not embrace either divine creation or evolution, instead arguing [[Aristotle's biology|in his biology]] that each species (''eidos'') was immutable, breeding true to its [[Hylomorphism|ideal eternal form]] (not the same as Plato's [[theory of Forms]]).{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=12–13}}{{sfn|Leroi|2015|p=89}} Aristotle's suggestion in ''[[De Generatione Animalium]]'' of a fixed hierarchy in nature - a ''scala naturae'' ("ladder of nature") provided an early explanation of the continuity of living things.{{sfn|Lloyd|1968|pp=166–169}}{{sfn|Leroi|2015|pp=276–278}}{{sfn|Mayr|1985|pp=201–202}} Aristotle saw that animals were [[teleology|teleological]] (functionally end-directed), and had parts that were [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with those of other animals, but he did not connect these ideas into a concept of evolutionary progress.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=43}}

In the Middle Ages, [[Scholasticism]] developed Aristotle's view into the idea of a [[great chain of being]].{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=21–23}} The image of a ladder inherently suggests the possibility of climbing, but both the ancient Greeks and mediaeval scholastics such as [[Ramon Lull]]{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=21–23}} maintained that each species remained fixed from the moment of its creation.{{sfn|Lovejoy|2011|p=228 and passim}}{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=43}}

By 1818, however, [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] argued in his ''Philosophie anatomique'' that the chain was "a progressive series", where animals like molluscs low on the chain could "rise, by addition of parts, from the simplicity of the first formations to the complication of the creatures at the head of the scale", given sufficient time. Accordingly, Geoffroy and later biologists looked for explanations of such evolutionary change.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=95}}

[[Georges Cuvier]]'s 1812 ''Recherches sur les Ossements Fossiles'' set out his doctrine of the correlation of parts, namely that since an organism was a whole system, all its parts mutually corresponded, contributing to the function of the whole. So, from a single bone the zoologist could often tell what class or even genus the animal belonged to. And if an animal had teeth adapted for cutting meat, the zoologist could be sure without even looking that its sense organs would be those of a predator and its intestines those of a carnivore. A species had an irreducible functional complexity, and "none of its parts can change without the others changing too".{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=18–21}} Evolutionists expected one part to change at a time, one change to follow another. In Cuvier's view, evolution was impossible, as any one change would unbalance the whole delicate system.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=18–21}}

[[Louis Agassiz]]'s 1856 "Essay on Classification" exemplified German philosophical idealism. This held that each species was complex within itself, had complex relationships to other organisms, and fitted precisely into its environment, as a pine tree in a forest, and could not survive outside those circles. The argument from such ideal forms opposed evolution without offering an actual alternative mechanism. [[Richard Owen]] held a similar view in Britain.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=42–43, 111}}

The Lamarckian social philosopher and evolutionist [[Herbert Spencer]], ironically the author of the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]" adopted by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]],{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=239, 342}} used an argument like Cuvier's to oppose natural selection. In 1893, he stated that a change in any one structure of the body would require all the other parts to adapt to fit in with the new arrangement. From this, he argued that it was unlikely that all the changes could appear at the right moment if each one depended on random variation; whereas in a Lamarckian world, all the parts would naturally adapt at once, through a changed pattern of use and disuse.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=149, 253, 259}}

==Alternative explanations of change==
{{further|Eclipse of Darwinism}}

Where the fact of evolutionary change was accepted by biologists but [[natural selection]] was denied, including but not limited to the late 19th century [[eclipse of Darwinism]], alternative scientific explanations such as [[Lamarckism]], [[orthogenesis]], [[structuralism]], [[catastrophism]], [[vitalism]] and theistic evolution&lt;!--don't link, that's a different topic--&gt;{{efn|Not to be confused with the more recent use of the term [[theistic evolution]], which refers to a theological belief in the compatibility of science and religion.}} were entertained, not necessarily separately. (Purely religious points of view such as young or old earth [[creationism]] or [[intelligent design]] are not considered here.) Different factors motivated people to propose non-Darwinian evolutionary mechanisms. Natural selection, with its emphasis on death and competition, did not appeal to some naturalists because they felt it immoral, leaving little room for [[Teleology in biology|teleology]] or the concept of progress in the development of life.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=197}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=119–120}} Some of these scientists and philosophers, like [[St. George Jackson Mivart]] and [[Charles Lyell]], who came to accept evolution but disliked natural selection, raised religious objections.{{sfn|Quammen|2006|pp=209–210}} Others, such as the biologist and philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]], the botanist [[George Henslow]] (son of Darwin's mentor [[John Stevens Henslow]], also a botanist), and the author [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], felt that evolution was an inherently progressive process that natural selection alone was insufficient to explain. Still others, including the American paleontologists [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]], had an idealist perspective and felt that nature, including the development of life, followed orderly patterns that natural selection could not explain.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=196–253}}

Some felt that natural selection would be too slow, given the estimates of the [[age of the earth]] and sun (10–100 million years) being made at the time by physicists such as [[Lord Kelvin]], and some felt that natural selection could not work because at the time the models for inheritance involved blending of inherited characteristics, an objection raised by the engineer [[Fleeming Jenkin]] in a review of ''Origin'' written shortly after its publication.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=196–253}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=105–129}} Another factor at the end of the 19th century was the rise of a new faction of biologists, typified by geneticists like [[Hugo de Vries]] and [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], who wanted to recast biology as an experimental laboratory science. They distrusted the work of naturalists like Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], dependent on field observations of variation, adaptation, and [[biogeography]], as being overly anecdotal. Instead they focused on topics like [[physiology]] and [[genetics]] that could be investigated with controlled experiments in the laboratory, and discounted less accessible phenomena like natural selection and [[adaptation]] to the environment.{{sfn|Endersby|2007|pp=143–147,182}}

===Vitalism===
[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis Pasteur]] believed that only living things could carry out [[fermentation]]. Painting by [[Albert Edelfelt]], 1885]]
{{main|Vitalism}}

Vitalism holds that living organisms differ from other things in containing something non-physical, such as a fluid or vital spirit, that makes them live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm |author=Bechtel, William; Robert C. Richardson |date=1998 |title=Vitalism |editor=Craig, E. |work=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory dates to ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jidenu, Paulin |date=1996 |title=African Philosophy |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-21096-8 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|BirchCobb|1985|pp=76–78}}
Since [[Early Modern]] times, vitalism stood in contrast to the mechanistic explanation of biological systems started by [[Descartes]]. Nineteenth century chemists  set out to disprove the claim that forming organic compounds required vitalist influence.&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt; In 1828, [[Friedrich Wöhler]] showed that [[urea]] could be made entirely from inorganic chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kinne-Saffran |first1=E. |last2=Kinne |first2=R.

===Theistic evolution===

The American botanist [[Asa Gray]] used the name "theistic evolution"{{efn|Gray, and later historians of science, did not refer to a 20th century usage of [[theistic evolution]] (described in that article), that one can accept Darwinian evolution without being an atheist.}} for his point of view, presented in his 1876 book ''Essays and Reviews Pertaining to Darwinism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gray, Asa |authorlink=Asa Gray |year=1876 |title=Essays and Reviews Pertaining to Darwinism |publisher=Appleton |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.19483|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.19483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the deity supplies beneficial mutations to guide evolution. [[St George Jackson Mivart]] argued instead in his 1871 ''On the Genesis of Species'' that the deity, equipped with foreknowledge, sets the direction of evolution by specifying the (orthogenetic) laws that govern it, and leaves species to evolve according to the conditions they experience as time goes by. [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|The Duke of Argyll]] set out similar views in his 1867 book ''The Reign of Law''.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–128}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=George|title=The Reign of Law|date=1867|publisher=Strahan|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/argyll/5rl.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian Edward Larson, the theory failed as an explanation in the minds of late 19th century biologists as it broke the rules of [[methodological naturalism]] which they had grown to expect.{{sfn|Larson|2004|p=126}} Accordingly, by around 1900, biologists no longer saw theistic evolution as a valid theory. In Larson's view, by then it "did not even merit a nod among scientists." Biologists might argue about mechanisms, but they were in no doubt that a mechanistic explanation was needed.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–128}} In the 20th century, theistic evolution could take other forms, such as the orthogenesis of Teilhard de Chardin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Morris, John D.; Morris, Henry M. |title=The Modern Creation Trilogy |year=1998 |publisher=New Leaf |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthogenesis===
[[File:Titanothere Osborn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] claimed in 1918 that [[Titanothere]] horns showed a non-[[adaptation|adaptive]] [[Orthogenesis|orthogenetic]] trend.]]
{{main|Orthogenesis}}

Orthogenesis is the hypothesis that life has an innate tendency to change, developing in a unilinear fashion in a particular direction, or simply making some kind of definite progress. Many different versions have been proposed, some such as that of [[Teilhard de Chardin]] openly spiritual, others such as [[Theodor Eimer]]'s apparently simply biological. These theories often combined orthogenesis with other supposed mechanisms. For example, Eimer believed in Lamarckian evolution, but felt that internal laws of growth determined which characteristics would be acquired and would guide the long-term direction of evolution.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=249}}{{sfn|Quammen|2006|p=221}}

Orthogenesis was popular among paleontologists such as [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]]. They believed that the fossil record showed unidirectional change, but did not necessarily accept that the mechanism driving orthogenesis was [[teleological]] (goal-directed). Osborn argued in his 1918 book ''Origin and Evolution of Life'' that trends in [[Titanothere]] horns were both orthogenetic and non-[[adaptation|adaptive]], and could be detrimental to the organism. For instance, they supposed that the large antlers of the [[Irish elk]] had caused its extinction.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=249}}{{sfn|Quammen|2006|p=221}}

Support for orthogenesis fell during the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1940s when it became apparent that it could not explain the complex branching patterns of evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the [[fossil record]].{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=196–253}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=105–129}} Work in the 21st century has supported the mechanism and existence of mutation-biased adaptation (a form of mutationism), meaning that constrained orthogenesis is now seen as possible.&lt;ref name=Yampolsky&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yampolsky, L.

===Lamarckism===
{{main|Lamarckism}}
[[File:Jean-baptiste lamarck2.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], drawn by [[Jules Pizzetta]], 1893]]

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s 1809 evolutionary theory, [[transmutation of species]], was based on a progressive (orthogenetic) drive toward greater complexity. Lamarck also shared the belief, common at the time, that [[inheritance of acquired characteristics|characteristics acquired during an organism's life could be inherited]] by the next generation, producing adaptation to the environment. Such characteristics were caused by the use or disuse of the affected part of the body. This minor component of Lamarck's theory became known, much later, as [[Lamarckism]].{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=86–95}} Darwin included ''Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by Natural Selection'' in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', giving examples such as large ground feeding birds getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the [[ostrich]], they could not fly at all.{{sfn|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F391&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=136 108]}} In the late 19th century, [[neo-Lamarckism]] was supported by the German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]], the American [[paleontologist]]s [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]], and the American [[entomology|entomologist]] [[Alpheus Spring Packard|Alpheus Packard]]. Butler and Cope believed that this allowed organisms to effectively drive their own evolution.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=236}} Packard argued that the loss of vision in the blind cave insects he studied was best explained through a Lamarckian process of atrophy through disuse combined with inheritance of acquired characteristics.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=236}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–129}}{{sfn|Quammen|2006|p=217}} Meanwhile, the English botanist [[George Henslow]] studied how environmental stress affected the development of plants, and he wrote that the variations induced by such environmental factors could largely explain evolution; he did not see the need to demonstrate that such variations could actually be inherited.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=239–240}} Critics pointed out that there was no solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Instead, the experimental work of the German biologist [[August Weismann]] resulted in the germ plasm theory of inheritance, which Weismann said made the inheritance of acquired characteristics impossible, since the [[Weismann barrier]] would prevent any changes that occurred to the body after birth from being inherited by the next generation.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=125–129}}{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=253–255}}

In modern [[epigenetics]], biologists observe that [[phenotype]]s depend on heritable changes to [[gene expression]] that do not involve changes to the [[DNA sequence]]. [[Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance|These changes can cross generations]] in plants, animals, and [[prokaryote]]s. This is not identical to traditional Lamarckism, as the changes do not last indefinitely and do not affect the germ line and hence the evolution of genes.&lt;ref name=Heard&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heard, E.; Martienssen, R. A. | title=Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance: myths and mechanisms | journal=Cell | volume=157 | issue=1 | pages=95–109 | year=2014 | pmid=24679529 | pmc=4020004 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.02.045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Baron Georges Cuvier Wellcome L0016365 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georges Cuvier]], shown here with a fossil fish, proposed [[catastrophism]] to explain the [[fossil record]].]]

===Catastrophism===
{{main|Catastrophism}}

Catastrophism is the [[hypothesis]], argued by the French [[anatomist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Georges Cuvier]] in his 1812 ''Recherches sur les ossements fossiles de quadrupèdes'', that the various [[extinction]]s and the patterns of [[faunal succession]] seen in the [[fossil]] record were caused by large-scale natural catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions and, for the most recent extinctions in Eurasia, the inundation of low-lying areas by the [[sea]]. This was explained purely by natural events: he did not mention [[Noah's flood]],{{sfn|McGowan|2001|pp=3–6}} nor did he ever refer to divine creation as the mechanism for repopulation after an extinction event, though he did not support evolutionary theories such as those of his contemporaries Lamarck and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire either.{{sfn|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–134}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waggoner |first=Ben |year=1996 |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/cuvier.html |title=Georges Cuvier (1769–1832) |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier believed that the [[stratigraphic]] record indicated that there had been several such catastrophes, recurring natural events, separated by long periods of stability during the history of life on earth. This led him to believe the Earth was several million years old.{{sfn|Rudwick|1972|p=131}}

Catastrophism has found a place in modern biology with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period, as proposed in a paper by 
[[Walter Alvarez|Walter]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] in 1980. It argued that a {{convert|10|km|mi}} [[asteroid]] [[Alvarez hypothesis|struck Earth 66 million years ago]] at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. The event, whatever it was, made about 70% of all species extinct, including the [[dinosaur]]s, leaving behind the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]].&lt;ref name=Alvarez&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alvarez |first1=L.W. |last2=Alvarez |first2=W. |last3=Asaro |first3=F. |last4=Michel |first4=H.

===Saltationism, mutationism===

It was seen as a much faster alternative to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection. It was popular with early geneticists such as [[Hugo de Vries]], who along with [[Carl Correns]] helped rediscover [[Gregor Mendel]]'s laws of inheritance in 1900, [[William Bateson]], a British zoologist who switched to genetics, and early in his career, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]. These ideas developed into [[mutationism]], the mutation theory of evolution.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=265–270}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=127–129, 157–167}} This held that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly as a result of environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation, based on de Vries's experiments with the evening primrose, ''[[Oenothera]]'', from 1886. The primroses seemed to be constantly producing new varieties with striking variations in form and color, some of which appeared to be new species because plants of the new generation could only be crossed with one another, not with their parents.{{sfn|Endersby|2007|pp=148–162}} However, [[Hermann Joseph Muller]] showed in 1918 that the new varieties de Vries had observed were the result of [[polyploid]] hybrids rather than rapid genetic mutation.{{sfn|Endersby|2007|pp=202–205}}

Initially, de Vries and Morgan believed that mutations were so large as to create new forms such as subspecies or even species instantly. Morgan's 1910 fruit fly experiments, in which he isolated mutations for characteristics such as white eyes, changed his mind. He saw that mutations represented small [[Mendelian]] characteristics that would only spread through a population when they were beneficial, helped by natural selection. This represented the germ of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], and the beginning of the end for mutationism as an evolutionary force.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=310–311}}

===Genetic drift===
[[File:Different Types of Mutations.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Many [[mutation]]s are [[neutral mutation|neutral]] or silent, having no effect on the [[amino acid]] sequence that is produced when the [[gene]] involved is [[translation (biology)|translated]] to [[protein]], and accumulate over time, forming a [[molecular clock]]. However this does not cause [[phenotype|phenotypic]] evolution.]]
{{main|Neutral theory of molecular evolution}}

The [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]], proposed by [[Motoo Kimura]] in 1968, holds that at the [[DNA sequence|molecular level]] most [[evolution]]ary changes and most of the variation within and between species is not caused by [[natural selection]] but by [[genetic drift]] of [[mutation|mutant]] [[allele]]s that are neutral. A [[neutral mutation]] is one that does not affect an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. The neutral theory allows for the possibility that most mutations are deleterious, but holds that because these are rapidly purged by natural selection, they do not make significant contributions to variation within and between species at the molecular level. Mutations that are not deleterious are assumed to be mostly neutral rather than beneficial.&lt;ref name=Kimura83/&gt;

The theory was controversial as it sounded like a challenge to Darwinian evolution; controversy was intensified by a 1969 paper by [[Jack Lester King]] and [[Thomas H. Jukes]], provocatively but misleadingly titled "[[Non-Darwinian Evolution (paper)|Non-Darwinian Evolution]]". It provided a wide variety of evidence including [[protein sequence]] comparisons, studies of the Treffers mutator gene in ''[[E. coli]]'',  analysis of the genetic code, and comparative [[immunology]], to argue that most protein evolution is due to neutral mutations and genetic drift.&lt;ref name=KingJukes1969&gt;{{cite journal |volume=164 |issue=3881 |pages=788–798 |last=King |first=Jack Lester |author2=Thomas H. Jukes  |title=Non-Darwinian Evolution |journal=Science |date=1969 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/citation/164/3881/788 |doi=10.1126/science.164.3881.788 |pmid=5767777 |bibcode=1969Sci...164..788L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01058626 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=21–59 |last=Dietrich |first=Michael R. |title=The origins of the neutral theory of molecular evolution |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |year=1994 |pmid=11639258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kimura, the theory applies only for evolution at the molecular level, while [[phenotype|phenotypic]] evolution is controlled by natural selection, so the neutral theory does not constitute a true alternative.&lt;ref name=Kimura83&gt;{{cite book |author=Kimura, Motoo |authorlink=Motoo Kimura |year=1983 |title=The neutral theory of molecular evolution |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-31793-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Austin L. |last=Hughes |title=Looking for Darwin in all the wrong places: the misguided quest for positive selection at the nucleotide sequence level |journal=Heredity |volume=99 |year=2007 |pages=364–373 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6801031 |pmid=17622265 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combined theories==
[[File:Alternatives to Darwinism.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Multiple explanations have been offered since the 19th century for how evolution took place, given that many scientists initially had objections to natural selection (dashed orange arrows). Many of these theories led (blue arrows) to some form of directed evolution ([[orthogenesis]]), with or without invoking [[theistic evolution|divine control]] (dotted blue arrows) directly or indirectly. For example, evolutionists like [[Edward Drinker Cope]] believed in a combination of theistic evolution, Lamarckism, vitalism, and orthogenesis,{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=261–262}} represented by the sequence of arrows on the extreme left of the diagram.]]

The various alternatives to Darwinian evolution by natural selection were not necessarily mutually exclusive. The evolutionary philosophy of the American palaeontologist [[Edward Drinker Cope]] is a case in point. Cope, a religious man, began his career denying the possibility of evolution. In the 1860s, he accepted that evolution could occur, but, influenced by Agassiz, rejected natural selection. Cope accepted instead the theory of recapitulation of evolutionary history during the growth of the embryo - that [[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]], which Agassiz believed showed a divine plan leading straight up to man, in a pattern revealed both in [[embryology]] and [[palaeontology]]. Cope did not go so far, seeing that evolution created a branching tree of forms, as Darwin had suggested. Each evolutionary step was however non-random: the direction was determined in advance and had a regular pattern (orthogenesis), and steps were not adaptive but part of a divine plan (theistic evolution). This left unanswered the question of why each step should occur, and Cope switched his theory to accommodate functional adaptation for each change. Still rejecting natural selection as the cause of adaptation, Cope turned to Lamarckism to provide the force guiding evolution. Finally, Cope supposed that Lamarckian use and disuse operated by causing a vitalist growth-force substance, "bathmism", to be concentrated in the areas of the body being most intensively used; in turn, it made these areas develop at the expense of the rest. Cope's complex set of beliefs thus assembled five evolutionary philosophies: recapitulationism, orthogenesis, theistic evolution, Lamarckism, and vitalism.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=261–262}} Other palaeontologists and field naturalists continued to hold beliefs combining orthogenesis and Lamarckism until the modern synthesis in the 1930s.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|p=264}}

==Rebirth of natural selection, with continuing alternatives==
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

By the start of the 20th century, during the [[eclipse of Darwinism]], biologists were doubtful of natural selection, but equally were quick to discount theories such as orthogenesis, vitalism and Lamarckism which offered no mechanism for evolution. Mutationism did propose a mechanism, but it was not generally accepted.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=128–129}} The [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] a generation later, roughly between 1918 and 1932, broadly swept away all the alternatives to Darwinism, though some including forms of orthogenesis,&lt;ref name=Stoltzfus/&gt;  [[transgenerational epigenetic inheritance|epigenetic mechanisms]] that resemble Lamarckian [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]],&lt;ref name=Heard/&gt; catastrophism,&lt;ref name=Alvarez/&gt; structuralism,&lt;ref name=Goodwin/&gt; and mutationism&lt;ref name=Stoltzfus_on_Nei2014/&gt; have been revived, such as through the discovery of molecular mechanisms.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=222–243, 284–286}}

Biology has become Darwinian, but belief in some form of progress (orthogenesis) remains both in the public mind and among biologists. Ruse argues that evolutionary biologists will probably continue to believe in progress for three reasons. Firstly, the [[anthropic principle]] demands people able to ask about the process that led to their own existence, as if they were the pinnacle of such progress. Secondly, scientists in general and evolutionists in particular believe that their work is leading them progressively closer to [[philosophical realism|a true grasp of reality]], as knowledge increases, and hence (runs the argument) there is progress in nature also. Ruse notes in this regard that [[Richard Dawkins]] explicitly compares cultural progress with [[meme]]s to biological progress with genes. Thirdly, evolutionists are self-selected; they are people, such as the entomologist and sociobiologist [[E. O. Wilson]], who are interested in progress to supply a meaning for life.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=536–539}}

During [[World War II]], some members of the [[United States military]] mutilated dead Japanese service personnel in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] of operations. The mutilation of Japanese service personnel included the taking of body parts as "war souvenirs" and "[[war trophies]]". Teeth and [[human skull|skulls]] were the most commonly taken "trophies", although other body parts were also collected.

The phenomenon of "trophy-taking" was widespread enough that discussion of it featured prominently in magazines and newspapers, and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] himself was reportedly given, by U.S. Representative [[Francis E. Walter]], a gift of a letter-opener made of a Japanese soldier's arm (Roosevelt later ordered that the gift be returned and called for its proper burial).{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=65}}{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}} The behavior was officially prohibited by the U.S. military, which issued additional guidance as early as 1942 condemning it specifically.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} Nonetheless, the behavior continued throughout the war in the Pacific Theater, and has resulted in continued discoveries of "trophy skulls" of Japanese [[combatants]] in American possession, as well as American and Japanese efforts to [[repatriate]] the remains of the Japanese dead.

==Trophy-taking==
[[File:AWM 072837.jpg|thumb|upright|PT-341, Alexishafen, New Guinea, April 30, 1944]]
A number of firsthand accounts, including those of American servicemen, attest to the taking of "trophies" from the corpses of Imperial Japanese troops in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] during [[World War II]]. Historians have attributed the phenomenon to a campaign of dehumanization of the Japanese in the U.S. media, to various racist tropes latent in American society, to the depravity of warfare under desperate circumstances, to the inhuman cruelty of Imperial Japanese forces, lust for revenge, or any combination of those factors.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The taking of so-called "trophies" was widespread enough that, by September 1942, the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet ordered that "No part of the enemy's body may be used as a souvenir", and any American servicemen violating that principle would face "stern disciplinary action".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Fussell. ''Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War''. 1990, page 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Trophy skulls are the most notorious of the souvenirs. Teeth, ears and other such body parts were occasionally modified, for example by writing on them or fashioning them into utilities or other artifacts.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=826}}

[[Eugene Sledge]] relates a few instances of fellow Marines extracting gold teeth from the Japanese, including one from an enemy soldier who was still alive.

&lt;blockquote&gt;But the Japanese wasn't dead. He had been wounded severely in the back and couldn't move his arms; otherwise he would have resisted to his last breath. The Japanese's mouth glowed with huge gold-crowned teeth, and his captor wanted them. He put the point of his [[Ka-Bar|kabar]] on the base of a tooth and hit the handle with the palm of his hand. Because the Japanese was kicking his feet and thrashing about, the knife point glanced off the tooth and sank deeply into the victim's mouth. The Marine cursed him and with a slash cut his cheeks open to each ear. He put his foot on the sufferer's lower jaw and tried again. Blood poured out of the soldier's mouth. He made a gurgling noise and thrashed wildly. I shouted, “Put the man out of his misery.” All I got for an answer was a cussing out. Another Marine ran up, put a bullet in the enemy soldier's brain, and ended his agony. The scavenger grumbled and continued extracting his prizes undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;(''[[With the Old Breed|With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa]]''. p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[U.S. Marine]] veteran Donald Fall attributed the mutilation of enemy corpses to hatred and desire for vengeance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On the second day of Guadalcanal we captured a big Jap bivouac with all kinds of beer and supplies&amp;nbsp;... But they also found a lot of pictures of Marines that had been cut up and mutilated [[Battle of Wake Island#War crimes|on Wake Island]]. The next thing you know there are Marines walking around with Jap ears stuck on their belts with safety pins. They issued an order reminding Marines that mutilation was a [[court-martial]] offense&amp;nbsp;... You get into a nasty frame of mind in combat. You see what's been done to you. You'd find a dead Marine that the Japs had booby-trapped. We found dead Japs that were booby-trapped. And they mutilated the dead. We began to get down to their level.{{sfn|Thayer|2004|p=186}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Skull and danger sign on Peleliu.jpg|right|thumb|Front line warning sign using a Japanese soldier's skull on [[Battle of Peleliu|Peleliu]] October 1944]]

Another example of mutilation was related by Ore Marion, a U.S. Marine who suggested,
&lt;blockquote&gt;We learned about savagery from the Japanese&amp;nbsp;... But those sixteen-to-nineteen-year old kids we had on the Canal were fast learners&amp;nbsp;... At daybreak, a couple of our kids, bearded, dirty, skinny from hunger, slightly wounded by bayonets, clothes worn and torn, wack off three Jap heads and jam them on poles facing the 'Jap side' of the river&amp;nbsp;... The colonel sees Jap heads on the poles and says, 'Jesus men, what are you doing? You're acting like animals.' A dirty, stinking young kid says, 'That's right Colonel, we are animals. We live like animals, we eat and are treated like animals–what the fuck do you expect?'{{sfn|Thayer|2004|p=186}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On February 1, 1943, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published a photograph taken by [[Ralph Morse]] during the [[Guadalcanal campaign]] showing a severed Japanese head that U.S. Marines had propped up below the gun turret of a tank. ''Life'' received letters of protest from people "in disbelief that American soldiers were capable of such brutality toward the enemy." The editors responded that "war is unpleasant, cruel, and inhuman. And it is more dangerous to forget this than to be shocked by reminders." However, the image of the severed head generated less than half the amount of protest letters that an image of a mistreated cat in the very same issue received.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://greyfalcon.us/restored/War.htm War, Journalism, and Propaganda]"&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Morse recounted that when his platoon came upon the tank with the head mounted on it, the sergeant warned his men not to approach it as it might have been set up by the Japanese in order to lure them in for a look. He feared that the Japanese might have a mortar tube zeroed in on it. Morse recalled the scene in this way, "'Everybody stay away from there,' the sergeant says, then he turns to me. 'You,' he says, 'go take your picture if you have to, then get out, quick.' So I went over, got my pictures and ran like hell back to where the patrol had stopped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3518085/life-behind-the-picture-skull-on-a-tank-guadalcanal-1942/|title=Guadalcanal: Rare and Classic Photos From a Pivotal WWII Campaign|author=Ben Cosgrove|date=Feb 19, 2014|work=TIME.com|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1943, the U.S. High Command expressed alarm over recent newspaper articles, for example one where a soldier made a string of beads using Japanese teeth, and another about a soldier with pictures showing the steps in preparing a skull, involving cooking and scraping of the Japanese heads.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}}

In 1944, the American poet [[Winfield Townley Scott]] was working as a reporter in [[Rhode Island]] when a sailor displayed his skull trophy in the newspaper office. This led to the poem ''The U.S. sailor with the Japanese skull'', which described one method for preparation of skulls (the head is skinned, towed in a net behind a ship to clean and polish it, and in the end scrubbed with [[caustic soda]]).{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=822}}

[[Charles Lindbergh]] refers in his diary entries to several instances of mutilations. For example, in the entry for August 14, 1944, he notes a conversation he had with a Marine officer, who claimed that he had seen many Japanese corpses with an ear or nose cut off.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} In the case of the skulls however, most were not collected from freshly killed Japanese; most came from already partially or fully skeletonised Japanese bodies.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} Lindbergh also noted in his diary his experiences from an air base in New Guinea, where according to him the troops killed the remaining Japanese stragglers "as a sort of hobby" and often used their leg-bones to carve utilities.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=826}}

[[Moros during World War II|Moro Muslim guerillas on Mindanao fought against Japan in World War II]]. The [[Moro people|Moro Muslim]] [[Datu]] Pino sliced the ears off Japanese soldiers and cashed them in with the American guerilla leader  [[Wendell Fertig|Colonel Fertig]] at the exchange rate of a pair of ears for one bullet and 20 centavos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iI_WAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=pino+centavos+bullet+japanese+ears Keats 1990], p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G8p3AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=pino+centavos+bullet+japanese+ears McClintock 1992], p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nL5BwIi7TJ0C&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=pino+centavos+bullet+japanese+ears Tucci 2009], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extent of practice===
According to Weingartner it is not possible to determine the percentage of U.S. troops that collected Japanese body parts, "but it is clear that the practice was not uncommon".{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=56}} According to Harrison only a minority of U.S. troops collected Japanese body parts as trophies, but "their behaviour reflected attitudes which were very widely shared".{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}}{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=56}} According to Dower, most U.S. combatants in the Pacific did not engage in "souvenir hunting" for bodyparts.{{sfn|Dower|1986|p=66}} The majority had some knowledge that these practices were occurring, however, and "accepted them as inevitable under the circumstances".{{sfn|Dower|1986|p=66}} The incidence of soldiers collecting Japanese body parts occurred on "a scale large enough to concern the Allied military authorities throughout the conflict and was widely reported and commented on in the American and Japanese wartime press".{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=818}} The degree of acceptance of the practice varied between units. Taking of teeth was generally accepted by [[enlisted men]] and also by officers, while acceptance for taking other body parts varied greatly.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} In the experience of one serviceman turned author, Weinstein, ownership of skulls and teeth were widespread practices.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|pp=822, 823}}

When interviewed by researchers former servicemen have related to the practice of taking gold teeth from the dead – and sometimes also from the living – as having been widespread.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/03/humanities.highereducation Film exposes Allies' Pacific war atrocities Horrific footage shot during battle with Japanese shows execution of wounded and bayoneting of corpses.] Jason Burke The Observer, Sunday June 3, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some disagreement between historians over what the more common forms of '[[War trophy|trophy hunting]]' undertaken by U.S. personnel were. [[John W. Dower]] states that ears were the most common form of trophy that was taken, and skulls and bones were less commonly collected. In particular he states that "skulls were not popular trophies" as they were difficult to carry and the process for removing the flesh was offensive.{{sfn|Dower|1986|p=65}} This view is supported by Simon Harrison.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} In contrast, [[Niall Ferguson]] states that "boiling the flesh off enemy [Japanese] skulls to make souvenirs was not an uncommon practice. Ears, bones and teeth were also collected".{{sfn|Ferguson|2007|p=546}}

The collection of Japanese body parts began quite early in the campaign, prompting a September 1942 order for disciplinary action against such souvenir taking.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} Harrison concludes that since this was the first real opportunity to take such items (the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]]), "Clearly, the collection of body parts on a scale large enough to concern the military authorities had started as soon as the first living or dead Japanese bodies were encountered."{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} When Charles Lindbergh passed through customs at Hawaii in 1944, one of the customs declarations he was asked to make was whether or not he was carrying any bones. He was told after expressing some shock at the question that it had become a routine point.{{sfn|Dower|1986|p=71}} This was because of the large number of souvenir bones discovered in customs, also including “green” (uncured) skulls.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=828}}

In 1984, Japanese soldiers' remains were repatriated from the [[Mariana Islands]]. Roughly 60 percent were missing their skulls.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=828}} Likewise it has been reported that many of the Japanese remains on [[Iwo Jima]] are missing their skulls.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=828}} It is possible that the souvenir collection of remains continued also in the immediate post-war period.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=828}}

===Context===
According to Simon Harrison, all of the "trophy skulls" from the World War II era in the forensic record in the U.S., attributable to an ethnicity, are of Japanese origin; none come from Europe{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=826}} (a seemingly rare exception to this rule was the case of a German soldier scalped by an American soldier, falsely attributed to a [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] tribal custom.&lt;ref&gt;"The taking and displaying of human body parts as trophies by Amerindians", Chacon and Dye, page 625 {{ISBN|9780387483030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films shot by the Special Film Project 186&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ch_Amy0YGI Chasing Hitler] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; near Prague, Czechoslovakia, on May 8, 1945, display an M4 Sherman with a skull and bones fixed to it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/online/film/display/detail.php?file_num=4686|title=LIBERATED CZECHOSLOVAKIA; WOUNDED AND DEAD GERMANS; POWS|publisher=Steven Spielberg Film and Video Archive|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Skulls from World War II, and also from the [[Vietnam War]], continue turning up in the U.S., sometimes returned by former servicemen or their relatives, or discovered by police. According to Harrison, contrary to the situation in average head-hunting societies, the trophies do not fit in American society. While the taking of the objects was socially accepted at the time, after the war, when the Japanese in time became seen as fully human again, the objects for the most part became seen as unacceptable and unsuitable for display. Therefore, in time they and the practice that had generated them were largely forgotten.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=828}}

Australian soldiers also mutilated Japanese bodies at times, most commonly by taking gold teeth from corpses.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=82}} This was officially discouraged by the [[Australian Army]].{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=82}} Johnston states that "one could argue that greed rather than hatred was the motive" for this behavior, but "utter contempt for the enemy was also present".{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=82}} Australians are also known to have taken gold teeth from German corpses, "but the practice was obviously more common in the South-West Pacific".{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=82}} "The vast majority of Australians clearly found such behaviour abhorrent, but "some of the soldiers who engaged in it were not 'hard cases'.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=82}} According to Johnston, Australian soldiers' "unusually murderous behavior" towards their Japanese opponents (such as killing prisoners) was caused by racism, a lack of understanding of Japanese military culture and, most significantly, a desire to take revenge against the murder and mutilation of Australian prisoners and native New Guineans during the [[Battle of Milne Bay]] and subsequent battles.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|pp=81–100}}

From the [[Burma Campaign]], there are recorded instances of British troops removing gold teeth and displaying Japanese skulls as trophies.&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Moreman "The jungle, the Japanese and the British Commonwealth armies at war, 1941–45", p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motives==

===Dehumanization===
[[File:Alaska Death Trap.jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. government propaganda poster from WWII featuring a Japanese soldier depicted as a rat&lt;/small&gt;]]
In the U.S., there was a widely propagated view that the Japanese were subhuman.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=67}}{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=54}} There was also popular anger in the U.S. at the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|surprise attack on Pearl Harbor]], amplifying pre-war racial prejudices.{{sfn|Ferguson|2007|p=546}} The U.S. media helped propagate this view of the Japanese, for example describing them as "yellow vermin".{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=54}} In an official [[U.S. Navy]] film, Japanese troops were described as "living, snarling rats".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weingartner|1992|p=54}} Japanese were alternatively described and depicted as "mad dogs", "yellow vermin", termites, apes, monkeys, insects, reptiles and bats etc.&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of underlying [[American racism]], which was added to by [[American propaganda during World War II#Anti-Japanese|U.S. wartime propaganda]], hatred caused by the Japanese [[war of aggression]], and both real and also fabricated [[Japanese war crimes|Japanese atrocities]], led to a general loathing of the Japanese.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=54}} Although there were objections to the mutilation from among other military jurists, "to many Americans the Japanese adversary was no more than an animal, and abuse of his remains carried with it no [[Social stigma|moral stigma]].{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|pp=66, 67}}

According to [[Niall Ferguson]]: "To the historian who has specialized in German history, this is one of the most troubling aspects of the Second World War: the fact that Allied troops often regarded the Japanese in the same way that Germans regarded Russians&amp;nbsp;— as ''[[Untermensch]]en''."{{sfn|Ferguson|2007|p=182}} Since the Japanese were regarded as animals, it is not surprising that Japanese remains were treated in the same way as animal remains.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=54}}

Simon Harrison comes to the conclusion in his paper, "Skull trophies of the Pacific War: transgressive objects of remembrance", that the minority of U.S. personnel who collected Japanese skulls did so because they came from a society that placed much value in hunting as a symbol of masculinity, combined with a de-humanization of the enemy.

War correspondent [[Ernie Pyle]], on a trip to Saipan after the [[Battle of Saipan|invasion]], claimed that the men who actually fought the Japanese did not subscribe to the wartime propaganda: "Soldiers and Marines have told me stories by the dozen about how tough the Japs are, yet how dumb they are; how illogical and yet how uncannily smart at times; how easy to rout when disorganized, yet how brave&amp;nbsp;... As far as I can see, our men are no more afraid of the Japs than they are of the Germans. They are afraid of them as a modern soldier is afraid of his foe, but not because they are slippery or rat-like, but simply because they have weapons and fire them like good, tough soldiers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediaschool.indiana.edu/erniepyle/1945/02/26/the-illogical-japs/|title=The Illogical Japs|author=Ernie Pyle|publisher=Rocky Mountain News|date=February 26, 1945|accessdate=17 October 2016|via=Indiana University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brutalization===
Some writers and veterans state that body parts trophy and souvenir taking was a side effect of the brutalizing effects of a harsh campaign.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=823}}

Harrison argues that, while brutalization could explain part of the mutilations, this explanation does not explain servicemen who, even before shipping off for the Pacific, proclaimed their intention to acquire such objects.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} According to Harrison, it also does not explain the many cases of servicemen collecting the objects as gifts for people back home.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} Harrison concludes that there is no evidence that the average serviceman collecting this type of souvenirs was suffering from "[[combat fatigue]]". They were normal men who felt this was what their loved ones wanted them to collect for them.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}} Skulls were sometimes also collected as souvenirs by non-combat personnel.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=823}}

A young Marine recruit, who had arrived on [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]] with his buddy Al in 1944, after the island was secure, provides an eyewitness account. After a brief firefight the night before, he and a small group of other Marines find the body of a straggler who had apparently shot himself:

:"I would have guessed that the dead Japanese was only about fourteen years old and there he lay dead. My thoughts turned to some mother back in Japan who would receive word that her son had been killed in battle. Then one of the Marines, who I found out later had been through other campaigns, reached over and roughly grabbed the Japanese soldier by the belt and ripped his shirt off. Somebody said, 'What are you looking for?' And he said, 'I'm looking for a money belt. Japs always carry money belts.' Well, this Jap didn't. Another Marine veteran of combat saw that the dead soldier had some gold teeth, so he took the butt of his rifle and banged him on the jaw, hoping to extract the gold teeth. Whether he did or not I don't know, because at that point I turned around and walked away. I went over to where I thought no one would see me and sat down. Although my eyes were dry, inside my heart was wrenching, not at seeing the dead soldier, but at seeing the way some of my comrades had treated that dead body. That bothered me a great deal. Pretty soon Al came over and sat down beside me and put his arm around my shoulder. He knew what I was feeling. When I turned to look at Al he had tears running down his face."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Petty, ''Saipan: Oral Histories of the Pacific War'', McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., 2002, {{ISBN|0-7864-0991-6}}, p 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenge===
[[File:Anti-Japan2.png|thumb|upright|News of the [[Bataan Death March]] sparked outrage in the US, as shown by this propaganda poster]]

Bergerud writes that U.S. troops hostility towards their Japanese opponents largely arose from incidents in which Japanese soldiers committed war crimes against Americans, such as the [[Bataan Death March]] and other incidents conducted by individual soldiers. For instance, Bergerud states that the U.S. Marines on Guadacanal were aware that the Japanese had beheaded some of the Marines captured on [[Wake Island]] prior to the start of the campaign. However this type of knowledge did not necessarily lead to revenge mutilations; one Marine states that they falsely thought the Japanese had not taken any prisoners at Wake Island, and therefore as revenge they killed all Japanese that tried to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Coleman Jersey "Hell's islands: the untold story of Guadalcanal", p. 169, 170&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Allied war crimes during World War II#Asia and the Pacific War|Allied war crimes during World War II]])

According to one Marine, the earliest account of U.S. troops wearing ears from Japanese corpses he recounts took place on the second day of the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] in August 1942 and occurred after photos of the mutilated bodies of Marines on Wake Island were found in Japanese engineers' personal effects. The account of the same Marine also states that Japanese troops booby-trapped some of their own dead as well as some dead Marines, and also mutilated corpses; the effect on Marines being "We began to get down to their level".{{sfn|Thayer|2004|p=186}} According to Bradley A. Thayer, referring to Bergerud and interviews conducted by Bergerud, the behaviors of American and Australian soldiers were affected by "intense fear, coupled with a powerful lust for revenge".{{sfn|Thayer|2004|p=185}}

Weingartner writes however that U.S. Marines were intent on taking [[gold teeth]] and making keepsakes of Japanese ears already while en route to Guadalcanal.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=556}}

===Souvenirs and bartering===
Factors relevant to the collection of body parts were their economic value, the desire both of the "folks back home" for a souvenir and of the servicemen themselves to have a keepsake when they returned home.

Some of the collected souvenir bones were modified, e.g. turned into letter-openers, and may be an extension of [[trench art]].{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=826}}

Pictures showing the "cooking and scraping" of Japanese heads may have formed part of the large set of Guadalcanal photographs sold to sailors which were circulating on the U.S. West-coast.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|pp=56, 57}} According to Paul Fussel, pictures showing this type of activity, i.e. boiling human heads; "were taken (and preserved for a lifetime) because the Marines were proud of their success".{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=822}}

According to Weingartner, some of the U.S. Marines who were about to take part in the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] were already while en route looking forward to collecting Japanese gold teeth for necklaces and to preserving Japanese ears as souvenirs.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=56}}

In many cases (and unexplainable by battlefield conditions) the collected body parts were not for the use of the collector but were instead meant to be gifts to family and friends at home,{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} in some cases as the result of specific requests from home.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} Newspapers reported of cases such as a mother requesting permission for her son to send her an ear or a bribed chaplain that was promised by an underage youth "the third pair of ears he collected".{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} A better-known example of those servicemen who left for battle already planning to send home a trophy is the ''Life Magazine'' picture of the week, whose caption begins:
:"When he said goodbye two years ago to Natalie Nickerson, 20, a war worker of Phoenix, Ariz., a big, handsome Navy lieutenant promised her a Jap. Last week Natalie received a human skull, autographed by her lieutenant and 13 friends ..."{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}}

Another example of this type of press is ''[[Yank, the Army Weekly|Yank]]'', that in early 1943 published a cartoon showing the parents of a soldier receiving a pair of ears from their son.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|pp=56, 57}} In 1942 [[Alan Lomax]] recorded a blues song where a black soldier promises to send his child a Japanese skull, and a tooth.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} Harrison also makes note of the Congressman that gave President Roosevelt a letter-opener carved out of bone as examples of the social range of these attitudes.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}}
[[File:Pacific war.jpg|thumb|Skull stewing-Pacific War]]
Trade sometimes occurred with the items, such as "members of the Naval Construction Battalions stationed on Guadalcanal selling Japanese skulls to merchant seamen" as reported in an Allied intelligence report from early 1944.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=823}} Sometimes teeth (particularly the less common gold teeth) were also seen as a trade-able commodity.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=823}}

==U.S. reaction==
"Stern disciplinary action" against human remains souvenir taking was ordered by the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet as early as September 1942.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} In October 1943 General [[George C. Marshall]] radioed General [[Douglas MacArthur]] about "his concern over current reports of atrocities committed by American soldiers".{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=57}} In January 1944 the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] issued a directive against the taking of Japanese body parts.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=57}} Simon Harrison writes that directives of this type may have been effective in some areas, "but they seem to have been implemented only partially and unevenly by local commanders".{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}}
[[File:LIFE May 1944 Jap Skull.jpg|thumb|upright|May 22, 1944 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]]'' Picture of the Week, "Arizona war worker writes her Navy boyfriend a thank-you-note for the Jap skull he sent her"]]

On May 22, 1944, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]]'' published a photo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=May 22, 1944 |author1=Inc, Time |title=Picture of the Week |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |page=35 |issn=0024-3019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bk8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35 |accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of an American girl with a Japanese skull sent to her by her naval officer boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;The image depicts a young blond at a desk gazing at a skull. The caption says: "When he said goodbye two years ago to Natalie Nickerson, 20, a war worker of Phoenix, Ariz., a big, handsome Navy lieutenant promised her a Jap. Last week Natalie received a human skull, autographed by her lieutenant and 13 friends, and inscribed: "This is a good Jap&amp;nbsp;– a dead one picked up on the New Guinea beach." Natalie, surprised at the gift, named it [[Hideki Tojo|Tojo]]. The armed forces disapprove strongly of this sort of thing.&lt;/ref&gt; The letters ''Life'' received from its readers in response to this photo were "overwhelmingly condemnatory"{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=58}} and the Army directed its Bureau of Public Relations to inform U.S. publishers that "the publication of such stories would be likely to encourage the enemy to take reprisals against American dead and prisoners of war".{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=60}} The junior officer who had sent the skull was also traced and officially reprimanded.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}} This was done reluctantly however, and the punishment was not severe.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|pp=65, 66}}

The ''Life'' photo also led to the U.S. Military taking further action against the mutilation of Japanese corpses. In a memorandum dated June 13, 1944, the Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|JAG]] asserted that "such atrocious and brutal policies" in addition to being repugnant also were violations of the laws of war, and recommended the distribution to all commanders of a directive pointing out that "the maltreatment of enemy war dead was a blatant violation of the [[Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on the Sick and Wounded]], which provided that: After each engagement, the occupant of the field of battle shall take measures to search for the wounded and dead, and to protect them against pillage and maltreatment." Such practices were in addition also in violation of the unwritten customary rules of land warfare and could lead to the death penalty.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=59}} The Navy JAG mirrored that opinion one week later, and also added that "the atrocious conduct of which some U.S. servicemen were guilty could lead to retaliation by the Japanese which would be justified under international law".{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=59}}

On June 13, 1944, the press reported that President Roosevelt had been presented with a letter-opener made out of a Japanese soldier's arm bone by [[Francis E. Walter]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] congressman.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}} Supposedly, the president commented, "This is the sort of gift I like to get", and "There'll be plenty more such gifts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1908&amp;dat=19440613&amp;id=WPgoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6tQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2176,4582411|title=Jones-Clayton Forces Behind Texas Revolt|work=The ''Nevada Daily Mail''|date=Jun 13, 1944|author=Drew Pearson|department=THE WASHINGTON MERRY-GO-ROUND}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several weeks later it was reported that it had been given back with the explanation that the President did not want this type of object and recommended it be buried instead. In doing so, Roosevelt was acting in response to the concerns which had been expressed by the military authorities and some of the civilian population, including church leaders.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}}

In October 1944, the Right Rev. [[Henry St. George Tucker (bishop)|Henry St. George Tucker]], the [[List of presiding bishops in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], issued a statement which deplored "'isolated' acts of desecration with respect to the bodies of slain Japanese soldiers and appealed to American soldiers as a group to discourage such actions on the part of individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Tucker Deplores Desecration of Foe; Mutilation of Japanese Bodies Contrary to Spirit of Army, He Says of 'Isolated' Cases |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1944/10/14/archives/tucker-deplores-desecration-of-foe-mutilation-of-japanese-bodies.html|work= |publisher=The New York Times |date=October 14, 1944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=The Morals of Victory |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,932499,00.html?promoid=googlep |work= |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=October 23, 1944 |accessdate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japanese reaction==
News that President Roosevelt had been given a bone letter-opener by a congressman was widely reported in Japan. The Americans were portrayed as "deranged, primitive, racist and inhuman". This reporting was compounded by the previous May 22, 1944, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine picture of the week publication of a young woman with a skull trophy, which was reprinted in the Japanese media and presented as a symbol of American barbarism, causing national shock and outrage.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=833}}&lt;ref&gt;Dickey, Colin: ''Afterlives of the Saints''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin P. Hoyt]] in ''Japan's War: The Great Pacific Conflict'' argues that two U.S. media reports of Japanese skulls and bones being sent home were exploited by Japanese [[propaganda]] very effectively, and this coupled to the [[Shinto]] religion, which places much higher emotional value on the treatment of human remains, contributed to a preference to death over surrender and occupation, shown, for example, in the mass civilian suicides on Saipan and Okinawa after the Allied landings.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=833}}&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt (1987), pp. 357–361&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hoyt, "The thought of a Japanese soldier's skull becoming an American ashtray was as horrifying in Tokyo as the thought of an American prisoner used for bayonet practice was in New York."&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt (1987), pp. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Some historians argue that a similar pattern of Asian dehumanization persisted in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, even though, like World War II, Asians were on both sides of those wars. In Vietnam, the supposed "[[Mere Gook Rule]]" allowed soldiers to harm or kill South Vietnamese citizens with little fear of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6q3vpJ3ePH4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=kill+anything+that+moves&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY64a5-NvQAhUM7GMKHYEgAo4Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam|last=Turse|first=Nick|date=2013-01-15|publisher=Macmillan|year=|isbn=9780805086911|location=|pages=50–51, 144, 191, 197, 226|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le bal paré.jpg|thumb|350px|right|French aristocrats, c. 1774]]
[[File:Krásna Hôrka 1.JPG|thumb|330px|right| A castle, the symbol of the rule of aristocracy in medieval Europe ([[Krásna Hôrka]] in [[Slovakia]]).]]

The '''aristocracy''' is a [[social class]] that a particular society considers its highest order. In many states, the aristocracy included the [[upper class]] of people (''aristocrats'') with hereditary rank and titles. In some—such as ancient Greece, Rome and India—aristocratic status came from belonging to a military [[caste]], although it has also been common, notably in African societies, for aristocrats to belong to priestly dynasties. Aristocratic status can involve feudal or legal privileges.&lt;ref&gt;''The aristocrats: a portrait of Britain's nobility and their way of life today'', by Roy Perrott, (London 1968), page5-10&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually below only the monarch of a [[country]] or [[nation]] in its [[social hierarchy]]. In modern European societies, the aristocracy has often coincided with the [[nobility]], a specific class that arose in the [[Middle Ages]], but the term "aristocracy" is sometimes also applied to other [[elite]]s, and is used as a more generic term when describing earlier and non-European societies.

==Etymology==
The term ''aristocracy'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀριστοκρατία (''[[aristocracy|aristokratia]]'' from ἄριστος (''aristos'') "excellent," and κράτος (''kratos'') "power."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to British History'', John Cannon (Editor), [[Oxford University Press]], 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-19-866176-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, aristocratic titles were and are hereditary.

The term "''aristokratia''" was first used in [[Athens]] with reference to young [[citizen]]s (the men of the ruling class) who led armies at the front line. Due to [[martial]] bravery being highly regarded as a [[virtue]] in [[ancient Greece]], it was assumed that the armies were being led by "the best." This virtue was called ''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'' ([[wiktionary:ἀρετή|ἀρετή]]). Etymologically, as the word developed, it also produced a more political term: ''[[aristoi]]'' ([[wiktionary:ἄριστος|ἄριστοι]]). The term aristocracy is a compound word stemming from the singular of aristoi, ''aristos'' ([[wiktionary:ἄριστος|ἄριστος]]), and the Greek word for power, ''kratos'' ([[wiktionary: κράτος|κράτος]]).

From the ancient Greeks, the term passed to the European [[Middle Ages]] for a similar ''hereditary class'' of military leaders, often referred to as [[Nobility#European nobility|the nobility]]. As in Greece, this was a class of privileged men and women whose familial connections to the regional armies allowed them to present themselves as the most "noble" or "best" of society.

==Europe==
[[File:COA bishop SK Revay Antal.png|thumb|right|Coat of arms of [[Révay family]] in the Kingdom of Hungary.]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Historically, the status and privileges of the aristocracy in Europe were below [[royal family|royalty]] and above all non-aristocrats.

The [[French Revolution]] attacked aristocrats as people who had achieved their status by having been born in a wealthy family rather than by [[:wikt:merit|merit]], and this was considered unjust. In the [[United Kingdom]] and other European countries, such as Spain and Denmark, in which [[hereditary titles]] are still recognised, ''aristocrat'' still refers to the descendant of one of approximately 7,000 families with hereditary titles, many still in possession of considerable wealth.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, members of the highest echelon of the aristocracy, the [[hereditary peer]]s were, [[House of Lords Act 1999|until 1999]], members of the [[House of Lords]]—the [[upper house]] of the [[legislature]], the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. In 1999, most ceased to be members. However, the [[Duke of Norfolk]], who always serves as [[Earl Marshal]], the hereditary peer who serves as [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] (currently the [[Marquess of Cholmondeley]]), and a further 90 [[Representative peer|Representative Hereditary Peers]] elected by the Hereditary Peers retained membership. [[Life Peerages Act 1958|Since 1958, non-hereditary "life peers" have been created]], who are automatically members of the House of Lords for life with the right to be known by their title. For example, [[John Gummer]] became (The Rt Hon.) Lord Deben.

However, life peers are not considered part of the aristocracy, nor are knights, unless born into an aristocratic or [[landed gentry]] family.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Examples include [[James Douglas-Hamilton, Baron Selkirk of Douglas]], and [[Sir Winston Churchill]]—all born into aristocratic families. Besides the hereditary peers, the [[Gentry|gentry]] (consisting of [[baronet]]s, [[Scottish feudal barony|Scottish barons]], [[Laird|lairds]], [[Esquire|esquires]], [[Gentleman|gentlemen]], and any other untitled landowning [[armigerous]] families) are also considered part of the aristocracy.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Unlike the Continental untitled nobility, British untitled families that belong to the gentry have no legal recognition of their aristocratic position.

==India==
[[File:Salimullah.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Nawab]] Sir [[Khwaja Salimullah]], [[zamindar]] of [[Dhaka Nawab Family|Dhaka]].]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Under the rule of the [[Mughal Empire]], the titles for those under a king were borrowed from [[Persia]]. These titles of [[landed aristocracy]] include ''[[jagirdar]]'', ''[[thikana]]dar'', ''[[talukdar]]'', and ''[[zamindar]]''.

Many landholding families either held legal or administrative offices, and were sometimes considered the Indian version of the Nobility of the Robe. The princes appointed officers, such as ''dewan'' and other state level ministers, to run their administrations, who were considered members of the regional nobility. Most of these officers were either relatives of the princes who appointed them, or were themselves substantial landlords under the sovereignty of the Princely States, and most held hereditary titles. Sometimes, educated men belonging to the British Imperial Services were also appointed to the high offices of the Princely States, but their positions were not hereditary and they were seen as career bureaucrats rather than noblemen by their employers.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Today, aristocratic titles like [[Taluqdar]], [[Rai (title)|Rai]], [[Rao (title)|Rao]], [[Roy]], [[Chaudhary]], [[Sardar]], [[Zaildar]], [[Jagirdar]], [[Tarafdar]],  [[Thakur (Indian title)|Thakur]], [[Nair]], [[Madampi (Nair title)|Madampi]] are still used in the Indian Subcontinent.

==Nigeria==
{{main|Nigerian traditional rulers}}
Deriving mostly from the pre-colonial states of the region that would become known as [[Nigeria]], the legally recognised titles of the Nigerian aristocracy range from ''[[king]]'' to the ubiquitous ''[[tribal chief|chief]]''. They give their bearers no political authority in theory, but in practice allow them to serve as immensely powerful patrons of the country's political leaders due to their control of popular opinion within its various [[tribe]]s. Along with those of their titled relatives and courtiers, they also serve as the guiding forces behind Nigerian cultural and religious ceremonies. 

Titles such as [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]], Amanyanaboh, [[Sayfawa dynasty|Mai]], Obong, [[Sokoto Caliphate|Sarki]], Attah, and [[Obi (ruler)|Obi]] are used by the dynastic heads, while ''[[prince]]'' and ''[[princess]]'' are either used in their English forms or in their native ones by the dynasts of their houses. Their privy counsellors, meanwhile, tend to be called either ''[[chieftain|chiefs]]'' or ''[[elder (administrative title)|elders]]'' depending on what their monarchs are themselves called, with chiefs serving under a ruler who is called a king and elders serving under one called a chief.

==China==
{{main|Chinese nobility}}
The nobility of China was an important feature of the traditional social and political organization of Imperial China. While the concepts of hereditary sovereign and peerage titles and noble families were featured as early as the semi-mythical early historical period, a settled system of nobility was established from the [[Zhou dynasty]]. In the subsequent millennia, this system was largely maintained in form, with some changes and additions, although the content constantly evolved. The last well-developed system of noble titles was established under the [[Qing dynasty]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2762">'''Bloch's Principle''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] principle in [[mathematics]]
stated by [[André Bloch (mathematician)|André Bloch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=A.|last=Bloch|
title=La conception actuelle de la theorie de fonctions entieres et meromorphes|journal=Enseignement math.|year=1926| volume=25|pages=83–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloch states the principle in Latin as: ''Nihil est in infinito quod non prius fuerit in finito,'' and explains this as follows:  Every proposition in whose statement the [[actual infinity]] occurs can be always considered a consequence, almost immediate, of a proposition where it does not occur, a proposition in ''finite terms''.

Bloch mainly applied this principle to the theory of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of a [[complex variable]].  Thus, for example, according to this principle, [[Picard's theorem]] corresponds to [[Schottky's theorem]], and [[Bloch's theorem (complex variables)|Valiron's theorem]] corresponds to [[Bloch's theorem (complex variables)|Bloch's theorem]].

Based on his Principle, Bloch was able to predict or conjecture several
important results such as the [[Ahlfors theory|Ahlfors's Five Islands theorem]],
[[Henri cartan|Cartan]]'s theorem on holomorphic curves omitting hyperplanes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref="la"|first=S.|last=Lang|
title=Introduction to complex hyperbolic spaces|publisher=[[Springer Verlag]]|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Hayman|Hayman]]'s result that an exceptional set of radii is unavoidable in [[Nevanlinna theory]].

In the more recent times several general theorems were proved which can be regarded as rigorous statements in the spirit of the Bloch Principle.{{cite needed|date=July 2018}}

==Zalcman's lemma==

Let &lt;math&gt;\{f_n\}&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of meromorphic functions in a region ''D'', which is not a [[normal family]].
Then there exist a sequence of points &lt;math&gt;z_n &lt;/math&gt; in ''D'' and positive numbers &lt;math&gt;\rho_n &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\rho_{n}=0&lt;/math&gt; such that

: &lt;math&gt;f_n(z_n+\rho_nz)\to f, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is a non-constant meromorphic function in the complex plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|first=L.|last=Zalcman|

Let ''X'' be a [[compact space|compact]] [[complex analytic manifold]], such that every [[holomorphic map]] from the [[complex plane]]
to ''X'' is constant. Then there exists a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on ''X'' such that every holomorphic map from the unit disc with the [[Poincaré metric]] to ''X'' does not increase distances.&lt;ref&gt;Lang (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tort law}}
In the [[United States]], the '''calculus of negligence''', also known as the '''Hand rule''', '''Hand formula''', or '''BPL formula''', is a term coined by Judge [[Learned Hand]] and describes a process for determining whether a legal duty of care has been breached (see [[negligence]]).  The original description of the calculus was in ''[[United States v. Carroll Towing Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[U.S. v. Carroll Towing]]'', 159 F.2d 169 ([[2d Cir.]] 1947).&lt;/ref&gt; in which an improperly secured [[barge]] had drifted away from a [[pier]] and caused damage to several other boats.

== Articulation of the rule ==
Hand stated:

{{quote|[T]he owner's duty, as in other similar situations, to provide against resulting injuries is a function of three variables: (1) The probability that she will break away; (2) the gravity of the resulting injury, if she does; (3) the burden of adequate precautions.}}

This relationship has been formalized by the [[law and economics]] school as such: an act is in breach of the [[duty of care]] if:

:&lt;math&gt;PL&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B'' is the cost (burden) of taking precautions, and ''P'' is the probability of loss (''L'').  ''L'' is the gravity of loss.  The product of P x L must be a greater amount than B to create a duty of due care for the defendant.

== Rationale ==
The calculus of negligence is based on the [[Coase theorem]].  The tort system acts as if, before the injury or damage, a contract had been made between the parties under the assumption that a [[Rationality|rational]], cost-minimizing individual will not spend money on taking precautions if those precautions are more expensive than the costs of the harm that they prevent.  In other words, rather than spending money on safety, the individual will simply allow harm to occur and pay for the costs of that harm, because that will be more cost-efficient than taking precautions.  This represents cases where B is greater than PL.

If the harm could be avoided for ''less'' than the cost of the harm (B is less than PL), then the individual ''should'' take the precautions, rather than allowing the harm to occur.  If precautions were not taken, we find that a legal duty of care has been breached, and we impose liability on the individual to pay for the harm.

This approach, in theory, leads to an optimal allocation of resources; where harm can be cheaply avoided, the legal system requires precautions.  Where precautions are prohibitively expensive, it does not.  In marginal-cost terms, we require individuals to invest one unit of precautions up until the point that those precautions prevent exactly one unit of harm, and no less.

== Criticism ==
Critics point out that term "gravity of loss (L)" is vague, and could entail a wide variety of damages, from a scratched fender to several dead victims.&lt;ref name="Glannon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glannon |first=Joseph W. |title=The Law of Torts |edition=3rd |year=2005 |publisher=[[Aspen Publishers]] |location=New York, NY |pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even then, on top of that, how exactly a juror should determine a value for such a loss is abstract in itself.  The speculative nature of the rule also seizes upon how a juror should determine the probability of loss (P).&lt;ref name="Glannon"/&gt;

Additionally, the rule fails to account for possible alternatives, whether it be the use of alternate methods to reach the same outcome, or abandoning the risky activity altogether.&lt;ref name="Glannon"/&gt;

Human teams estimating risk need to guard against judgment errors, cf. [[absolute probability judgement]].

== Use in practice ==
In the U.S., juries, with guidance from the court, decide what particular acts or omissions constitute negligence, so a reference to the standard of ordinary care removes the need to discuss this moot "rule". Juries are not told this "rule" but essentially use their common sense to decide what an ordinarily careful person would have done under the circumstances. The "calculus of negligence" has less practical value for the lay researcher seeking to understand how the courts actually determine negligence cases in the United States than the [[jury instructions]] used by the courts in the individual states.

Outside legal proceedings, this rule is the core premise of [[insurance]], [[risk management]], [[quality assurance]], [[information security]] and [[privacy]]{{clarify|date=July 2015}} practices.  It factors into [[due care]] and [[due diligence]] decisions in business risk.  Restrictions exist in the cases where the loss applies to human life or the probability of adverse finding in court cases. One famous case of abuse by industry in recent years related to the [[Ford Pinto]].

Quality assurance techniques extend the use of probability and loss to include uncertainty bounds in each quantity and possible interactions between uncertainty in probability and impact for two purposes.  First, to more accurately model customer acceptance and process reliability to produce wanted outcomes.  Second, to seek cost effective factors either up or down stream of the event that produce better results at sustainably reduced costs.  Example, simply providing a protective rail near a cliff also includes quality manufacture features of the rail as part of the solution.  Reasonable signs warning of the risk before persons reach the cliff may actually be more effective in reducing fatalities than the rail itself.

== Australia ==
In Australia, the calculus of negligence is a normative judgement with no formula or rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|63|2005|litigants=Mulligan v Coffs Harbour City Council |parallelcite=(2005) 223 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 486 |date=21 October 2005 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In NSW, the test is how a reasonable person (or other standard of care) would respond to the risk in the circumstances considering the 'probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken'&lt;ref name="CLA2002"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|cla2002161|Civil Liability Act 2002|5B}}(2)(a).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|5|1998|litigants=Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory |parallelcite=(1998) 192 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 432 |date=2 February 1998 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and, 'the likely seriousness of the harm',&lt;ref name="CLA2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|court=UKHL |year=1950 |num=3 |litigants=[[Paris v Stepney Borough Council]] |parallelcite=[1951] {{abbr|AC|Appeal Cases}} 367 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 'the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm',&lt;ref name="CLA2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|9|2002|litigants=Woods v Multi-Sport Holdings Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(2002) [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 460 |date= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 'social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm'.&lt;ref name="CLA2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|20|1991|litigants=E v Australian Red Cross Society |parallelcite=(1991) 27 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 310 |date= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; State and Territory legislatures require that the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm be taken into account in determining whether or not a reasonable person would have taken precautions against that risk of harm.&lt;ref name="CLA2002"/&gt; For example, in ''Haris v Bulldogs Rugby League Club Limited'' &lt;ref name="Haris v Bulldogs"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|53|2006|litigants=Haris v Bulldogs Rugby League Club Limited |date=17 March 2006 |courtname= auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the court considered the social utility of holding football matches when determining whether a football club took sufficient precautions to protect spectators from the risk of being struck by fireworks set off as part of the entertainment during a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|53|2006|litigants=Haris v Bulldogs Rugby League Club Limited |date=17 March 2006 |courtname= auto}} per Santow JA at [60]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Castigation''' (from the Latin ''castigatio'') or '''chastisement''' (via the French ''châtiment'') is the infliction of severe (moral or corporal) [[punishment]].  One who administers a castigation is a '''castigator''' or ''chastiser''.  

In earlier times, castigation specifically meant restoring one to a religiously pure state, called [[chastity]].  In ancient Rome, it was also a term for the [[magistrate]] called a [[Censor (ancient Rome)|censor]] (in the original sense, rather than the later politicized evolution), who castigated in the name of the pagan state religion but with the authority of the 'pious' state.

In Christian times, this terminology was adopted but roughly restricted to the physical sphere: chastity became a matter of approved sexual conduct, castigation usually meaning [[physical punishment]], either as a form of [[penance]], as a voluntary pious exercise (see [[mortification of the flesh]]) or as educational or other coercion, while the use for other (e.g. verbal) punishments (and criticism etc.) is now often perceived as metaphorical.

'''Self-castigation''' is applied by the repentant culprit to himself, for moral and/or religious reasons, notably as [[penance]].

{{Revolution sidebar}}
'''Class conflict''', frequently referred to as '''class warfare''' or '''class struggle''', is the tension or antagonism which exists in [[society]] due to competing [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] interests and desires between people of different [[Social class|classes]]. The view that the class struggle provides the lever for radical social change for the majority is central to the work of  [[Karl Marx]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].

Class conflict can take many different forms: direct violence, such as wars fought for resources and cheap labor; indirect violence, such as deaths from poverty, starvation, illness or unsafe working conditions; coercion, such as the threat of losing a job or the pulling of an important investment; or ideologically, such as with books and articles. Additionally, political forms of class conflict exist; legally or illegally lobbying or bribing government leaders for passage of desirable partisan legislation including labor laws, tax codes, consumer laws, acts of congress or other sanction, injunction or tariff. The conflict can be direct, as with a [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] aimed at destroying a [[trade union|labor union]], or indirect, as with an informal slowdown in production protesting low wages by workers or [[unfair labor practice]]s by capital.

In the past the term ''Class conflict'' was a term used mostly by [[socialism|socialists]] and [[Marxism|Marxists]], who define a class by its relationship to the [[means of production]]—such as factories, land and machinery. From this point of view, the social control of production and labor is a contest between classes, and the division of these resources necessarily involves conflict and inflicts harm. It can involve ongoing low-level clashes, escalate into massive confrontations, and in some cases, lead to the overall defeat of one of the contending classes.  However, in more contemporary times this term is striking chords and finding new definition amongst capitalistic societies in the [[United States]] and other Westernized countries.

The anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] argued that the class struggle of the working class, peasantry and poor had the potential to lead to a social revolution involving the overthrow of ruling elites, and the creation of [[libertarian socialism]]. This was only a potential, and class struggle was, he argued, not always the only or decisive factor in society, but it was central. By contrast, [[Marx's theory of history|Marxists argue]] that [[historical materialism|class conflict always plays the decisive and pivotal role in the history of class-based hierarchical systems]] such as [[capitalism]] and [[feudalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Communist Manifesto]] |last=Marx |first=Karl |display-authors=etal |authorlink=Karl Marx |year=1848 |publisher=www.marxists.org |location=[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm]  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxists refer to its overt manifestations as class war, a struggle whose resolution in favor of the [[working class]] is viewed by them as inevitable under plutocratic [[capitalism]].

=== Pre-capitalist societies ===

Where societies are socially divided based on status, wealth, or control of social production and distribution, class structures arise and are thus coeval with civilization itself. It is well documented since at least European Classical Antiquity ([[Conflict of the Orders]], [[Spartacus]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World]]'' G.E.M. DE Ste. Croix Cornell University Press 1981 {{ISBN|0-8014-9597-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Popular revolt in late medieval Europe|the various popular uprisings in late medieval Europe]] and elsewhere.

One of the earliest analysis of these conflicts is [[Friedrich Engels]]' [[The Peasant War in Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, The Peasant War in Germany, marxists.org&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest analyses of the development of class as the development of conflicts between emergent classes is available in [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|Mutual Aid]]''. In this work, Kropotkin analyzes the disposal of goods after death in pre-class or [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, and how inheritance produces early class divisions and conflict.

Historian Steve Fraser, author of ''The Age of Acquiescence: The Life and Death of American Resistance to Organized Wealth and Power'', asserts that class conflict is an inevitability if current political and economic conditions continue, noting that “people are increasingly fed up… their voices are not being heard. And I think that can only go on for so long without there being more and more outbreaks of what used to be called class struggle, class warfare.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://billmoyers.com/episode/steve-fraser-new-robber-barons/ Full Show: The New Robber Barons] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20141223054003/http://billmoyers.com/episode/steve-fraser-new-robber-barons/ |date=2014-12-23 }}.

== Capitalist societies ==

The typical example of class conflict described is class conflict within capitalism.  This class conflict is seen to occur primarily between the [[bourgeoisie]] and the [[proletariat]], and takes the form of conflict over hours of work, value of wages, division of profits, cost of consumer goods, the culture at work, control over [[parliament]] or [[bureaucracy]], and [[economic inequality]].  The particular implementation of government programs which may seem purely humanitarian, such as disaster relief, can actually be a form of class conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Palast, Burn baby burn {{cite web |url=http://www.gregpalast.com/burn-baby-burnthe-california-celebrity-fires/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230023754/http://www.gregpalast.com/burn-baby-burnthe-california-celebrity-fires/ |archivedate=2007-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA class conflict is often noted in labor/management disputes. As far back as 1933 representative Edward Hamilton of ALPA, the [[Air Line Pilots Association, International|Airline Pilot's Association]], used the term "class warfare" to describe airline management's opposition at the National Labor Board hearings in October of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaps|first=Robert W.|title=Air Transport Labor Relations|year=1997|publisher=Southern Illinois Press|location=Section 3: Major Collective Bargaining Legislation|isbn=0-8093-1776-1|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these day-to-day forms of class conflict, during periods of crisis or revolution class conflict takes on a violent nature and involves repression, assault, restriction of civil liberties, and murderous violence such as assassinations or death squads.

=== Thomas Jefferson, United States ===

Although [[Thomas Jefferson]] (1743–1826) led the United States as president from 1801–1809 and is considered one of the founding fathers, he died with immense amounts of debt. Regarding the interaction between social classes, he wrote,
{{Quote|text=I am convinced that those societies (as the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]) which live without government enjoy in their general mass an infinitely greater degree of happiness than those who live under the European governments. Among the former, public opinion is in the place of law, &amp; restrains morals as powerfully as laws ever did anywhere. Among the latter, under pretence of governing they have divided their nations into two classes, wolves &amp; sheep. I do not exaggerate. This is a true picture of Europe. Cherish therefore the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. Do not be too severe upon their errors, but reclaim them by enlightening them. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you &amp; I, &amp; Congress &amp; Assemblies, judges &amp; governors shall all become wolves. It seems to be the law of our general nature, in spite of individual exceptions; and experience declares that man is the only animal which devours his own kind, for I can apply no milder term to the governments of Europe, and to the general prey of the rich on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter to Edward Carrington - January 16, 1787|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Letter_to_Edward_Carrington_-_January_16,_1787|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116033458/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Letter_to_Edward_Carrington_-_January_16,_1787|archivedate=January 16, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[Thomas Jefferson]]|source=''Letter to Edward Carrington - January 16, 1787''}}

=== Noam Chomsky ===

[[File:Noam Chomsky, 2004.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Noam Chomsky]], 2004]]

[[Noam Chomsky]], American [[Linguistics|linguist]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]], and [[political activist]] has criticized class war in the United States:
{{quote|Well, there’s always a class war going on. The United States, to an unusual extent, is a business-run society, more so than others. The business classes are very class-conscious—they’re constantly fighting a bitter class war to improve their power and diminish opposition. Occasionally this is recognized...

=== Max Weber, Germany ===

[[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) agrees with the fundamental ideas of Karl Marx about the economy causing class conflict, but claims that class conflict can also stem from prestige and power.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; Weber argues that classes come from the different property locations. Different locations can largely affect one's class by their education and the people they associate with.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; He also states that prestige results in different status groupings. This prestige is based upon the social status of one's parents. Prestige is an attributed value and many times cannot be changed. Weber states that power differences led to the formation of [[political parties]].&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; Weber disagrees with Marx about the formation of classes. While Marx believes that groups are similar due to their economic status, Weber argues that classes are largely formed by [[social status]].&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; Weber does not believe that communities are formed by economic standing, but by similar social prestige.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; Weber does recognize that there is a relationship between social status, social prestige and classes.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt;

=== Marxist perspectives ===
[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Karl Marx, 1875]]

[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) was a German born philosopher who lived the majority of his adult life in London, England. In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Karl Marx  argued that a [[Social class|class]] is formed when its members achieve [[class consciousness]] and solidarity.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;Blackwell Reference Online.''[http://www.blackwellreference.com./subscriber/uid=834/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g97814051243319_ss1-50]''. Retrieved November 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This largely happens when the members of a class become aware of their [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and the conflict with another class. A class will then realize their shared interests and a common identity. According to Marx, a class will then take action against those that are exploiting the lower classes.

What Marx points out is that members of each of the two main classes have interests in common. These class or collective interests are in conflict with those of the other class as a whole. This in turn leads to conflict between individual members of different classes.

Marxist analysis of society identifies two main social groups: 
* ''Labour'' (the [[proletariat]] or workers) includes anyone who earns their livelihood by selling their [[labor power]] and being paid a wage or salary for their labor time. They have little choice but to work for capital, since they typically have no independent way to survive.
* ''Capital'' (the [[bourgeoisie]] or capitalists) includes anyone who gets their income not from labor as much as from the [[surplus value]] they appropriate from the workers who create wealth. The income of the capitalists, therefore, is based on their [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploitation]] of the workers (proletariat).

Not all class struggle is violent or necessarily radical, as with strikes and lockouts. Class antagonism may instead be expressed as low worker morale, minor sabotage and pilferage, and individual workers' abuse of petty authority and hoarding of information. It may also be expressed on a larger scale by support for socialist or populist parties. On the employers' side, the use of union busting legal firms and the lobbying for anti-union laws are forms of class struggle.

Not all class struggle is a threat to capitalism, or even to the authority of an individual capitalist. A narrow struggle for higher wages by a small sector of the working-class, what is often called "economism", hardly threatens the status quo. In fact, by applying the craft-union tactics of excluding other workers from skilled trades, an economistic struggle may even weaken the working class as a whole by dividing it. Class struggle becomes more important in the historical process as it becomes more general, as industries are organized rather than crafts, as workers' class consciousness rises, and as they self-organize away from political parties. Marx referred to this as the progress of the proletariat from being a class "in itself", a position in the social structure, to being one "for itself",an active and conscious force that could change the world.

Marx largely focuses on the capital industrialist society as the source of [[social stratification]], which ultimately results in class conflict.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; He states that capitalism creates a division between classes which can largely be seen in manufacturing factories. The proletariat, is separated from the bourgeoisie because production becomes a social enterprise. Contributing to their separation is the technology that is in factories. Technology de-skills and alienates workers as they are no longer viewed as having a specialized skill.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; Another effect of technology is a homogenous [[workforce]] that can be easily replaceable. Marx believed that this class conflict would result in the overthrow of the bourgeoisie and that the private property would be communally owned.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; The mode of [[Production (economics)|production]] would remain, but communal ownership would eliminate class conflict.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt;

Even after a revolution, the two classes would struggle, but eventually the struggle would recede and the classes dissolve. As class boundaries broke down, the state apparatus would wither away. According to Marx, the main task of any state apparatus is to uphold the power of the ruling class; but without any classes there would be no need for a state. That would lead to the classless, stateless communist society.

=== The Soviet Union and similar societies ===
A variety of predominantly [[trotskyist]] and [[anarchist]] thinkers argue that class conflict existed in [[Soviet Union|Soviet-style societies]].  Their arguments describe as a class the bureaucratic [[stratum]] formed by the ruling [[political party]] (known as the [[Nomenklatura]] in the Soviet Union)—sometimes termed a "[[new class]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Milovan | last = Đilas | authorlink = Milovan Đilas | year = 1983, 1957 | title = The New Class: An Analysis of the Communist System | edition = paperback | publisher = Harcourt Brace Jovanovich | location = San Diego | isbn = 0-15-665489-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;—that controls and guides the means of production. This ruling class is viewed to be in opposition to the remainder of society, generally considered the [[proletariat]].  This type of system is referred by them as [[state socialism]], [[state capitalism]], [[bureaucratic collectivism]] or [[new class]] societies. (Cliff; Ðilas 1957) Marxism was such a predominate ideological power in what became the Soviet Union since a Marxist group known as the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] was formed in the country, prior to 1917. This party soon divided into two main factions; the Bolsheviks, who were led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], and the [[Mensheviks]], who were led by [[Julius Martov]].

However many Marxist argue that unlike in Capitalism, the Soviet elites didn't own the [[Means of production]], or generated [[surplus value]] for their personal wealth like in capitalism, as the generated profit from the economy was equally distributed into Soviet society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harpal|first1=Brar|title=Trotskyism or Leninism?|date= October 1993|location=London|isbn=1874613036|pages=647}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even some trotskyist like [[Ernest Mandel]] criticized the concept of a new ruling class as an [[oxymoron]]. He said: "The hypothesis of the bureaucracy’s being a new ruling class leads to the conclusion that, for the first time in history, we are confronted with a “ruling class” which does not exist as a class before it actually rules."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ernest|first1=Mandel|title=Why The Soviet Bureaucracy is not a New Ruling Class (1979)|url=https://www.ernestmandel.org/en/works/txt/1979/soviet_bureaucracy.htm|accessdate=26 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522081826/http://www.ernestmandel.org/en/works/txt/1979/soviet_bureaucracy.htm|archivedate=22 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-Marxist perspectives ===
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}

Social commentators, historians and socialist theorists had commented on class struggle for some time before Marx, as well as the connection between class struggle, property, and law: [[Augustin Thierry]],&lt;ref&gt;Augustin Thierry: [https://books.google.com/books?id=c5A1lIZb5H8C&amp;dq=Histoire+du+Tiers+%C3%89tat&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Recueil des monuments inédits de l'histoire du Tiers état] {{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Guizot]], [[François-Auguste Mignet]] and [[Adolphe Thiers]]. The [[Physiocrat]]s, [[David Ricardo]], and after Marx, [[Henry George]] noted the inelastic supply of land and argued that this created certain privileges ([[economic rent]]) for landowners. According to the historian [[Arnold Toynbee]], stratification along lines of class appears only within civilizations, and furthermore only appears during the process of a civilization's decline while not characterizing the growth phase of a civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toynbee|first=Arnold|title=A Study of History: Abridgment of Volumes I - VI|year=1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-19-505081-9|editor=Dorothea Grace Somervell|page=365|chapter=The Nature of Disintegration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proudhon, in ''[[What is Property?]]'' (1840) states that "certain classes do not relish investigation into the pretended titles to property, and its fabulous and perhaps scandalous history."&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Proudhon, ''What is Property?'', chapter 2, remark 2.&lt;/ref&gt; While Proudhon saw the solution as the lower classes forming an alternative, solidarity economy centered on cooperatives and self-managed workplaces, which would slowly undermine and replace capitalist class society, the anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]], while influenced by Proudhon, insisted that a massive class struggle by the working class, peasantry and poor was essential to the creation of [[libertarian socialism]]. This would require a (final) showdown in the form of a social revolution.

[[Fascists]] have often opposed class struggle and instead have attempted to appeal to the working class while promising to preserve the existing social classes and have proposed an alternative concept known as [[class collaboration]].

Some historical tendencies of Orthodox Marxism [[No War but the Class War|reject]] racism, sexism, etc. as struggles that essentially [[false consciousness|distract]] from class struggle, the real conflict.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} These divisions within the class prevent the purported antagonists from acting in their common class interest. However, many Marxist internationalists and anti-colonial revolutionaries understand [https://libcom.org/library/sex-race-class-james-selma sex, race and class] to be bound up together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-06|title=Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Organization_of_Solidarity_with_the_People_of_Asia,_Africa_and_Latin_America&amp;oldid=829056713|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ongoing debate within Marxist scholarship about these topics.

According to [[Michel Foucault]], in the 19th century the [[essentialist]] notion of the "[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]" was incorporated by [[racism|racists]], [[biologists]], and [[eugenicists]], who gave it the modern sense of "biological race" which was then integrated to "[[state racism]]". On the other hand, Foucault claims that when [[Marxists]] developed their concept of "class struggle", they were partly inspired by the older, non-biological notions of the "race" and the "race struggle". In a letter to Friedrich Engels in 1882 Karl Marx wrote: ''You know very well where we found our idea of class struggle; we found it in the work of the French historians who talked about the race struggle.''&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Society Must be Defended'' by Michel Foucault (trans. [[David Macey]]), London: Allen Lane, Penguin Press (1976, 2003), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|reason=original source not listed|date=October 2016}}For Foucault, the theme of social war provides the overriding principle that connects class and race struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Laura Stoler, ''Race and the Education of Desire: Foucault's "History of Sexuality" and the Colonial Order of Things '', Duke University Press (1995), p.71-72&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moses Hess]], an important theoretician and [[Labor Zionism|labor zionist]] of the early socialist movement, in his "Epilogue" to "[[Rome and Jerusalem]]" argued that "the race struggle is primary, the class struggle secondary... With the cessation of race [[antagonism (philosophy)|antagonism]], the class struggle will also come to a standstill. The equalization of all classes of society will necessarily follow the [[emancipation]] of all the races, for it will ultimately become a scientific question of social economics."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in ''Prophecy and Politics: Socialism, Nationalism, and the Russian Jews'' by [[Jonathan Frankel]], Cambridge University Press (1981), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] theorized that the [[intersectional]] paradigms of race, class, and nation might explain certain aspects of black political economy. [[ Patricia Hill Collins]] writes: "Du Bois saw race, class, and nation not primarily as personal identity categories but as social hierarchies that shaped African-American access to status, poverty, and power."&lt;ref name="Collins 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Collins | first = Patricia Hill | author-link = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Gender, black feminism, and black political economy | journal = [[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] | volume = 568 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–53 | doi = 10.1177/000271620056800105 | date = March 2000 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}

In modern times, emerging schools of thought in the U.S. and other countries hold the opposite to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John H.|authorlink1=John H.

[[File:Notification on 21 October 1941.jpg|thumb|[[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] announcement of killing 2300 civilians in the [[Kragujevac massacre]] as retaliation for 10 German soldiers killed by [[Yugoslav Partisans]] in Nazi-occupied [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|Serbia]], 1941]]
'''Collective punishment''' is a form of retaliation whereby a suspected perpetrator's [[kin punishment|family members]], friends, acquaintances, [[sect]], neighbors or entire ethnic group is targeted. The punished group may often have no direct association with the other individuals or groups, or direct control over their actions. In times of war and armed conflict, collective punishment has resulted in atrocities, and is a violation of the [[laws of war]] and the [[Geneva Conventions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Garner|editor1-first=Bryan A.|editor1-link=Bryan A. Garner|title=Black's Law Dictionary|date=2007|publisher=Thomson West|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=0314151990|page=280|edition=8th|quote=Collective punishment was outlawed in 1949 by the Geneva Convention.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, [[Military occupation|occupying powers]] have used collective punishment to retaliate against and deter attacks on their forces by [[Resistance movement]]s (such as destroying entire towns and villages which were believed to have harboured or aided such resistance movements).

==History==
===2nd century BC===
During the [[Qin Dynasty]] of China (221–207 BC), emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] upheld his rule by enforcing strict laws, with the most serious of crimes, such as [[treason]], punishable by what is known as [[nine familial exterminations]] – this involved the execution of the perpetrator's entire families as well as the perpetrators themselves, where the members are categorized into nine groups. The process of familial extermination was carried on by subsequent Chinese dynasties for serious crimes, with a significant number of recorded sentences during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644), until the punishment was officially repealed by the government of the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1912) in 1905.

===9th–15th centuries===
{{see also|Sippenhaft}}
In the [[Tithing]], groups of ten men swearing the [[Frankpledge]], the compulsory sharing of responsibility and punishment, was in use at least since the time of [[Alfred the Great]] in the 9th century. The [[Statute of Winchester]] of 1285 provided that "the whole [[hundred (division)|hundred]] … shall be answerable" for any theft or robbery.

===16th century===
During the [[Ming dynasty]] of China, 16 palace women [[Renyin palace rebellion|attempted to assassinate]] the [[Jiajing Emperor]]. All were sentenced to death by [[Lingchi|slow slicing]]. Ten members of the women's families were also beheaded, while a further 20 were enslaved and gifted to ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1=History Office | title=明實錄：明世宗實錄 | language=Chinese | trans-title=Veritable Records of the Ming: Veritable Records of Shizong of Ming | url=http://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=gb&amp;res=309093 | publisher=Ctext | date=1620s | volume=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
The [[Intolerable Acts]] were seen as a collective punishment of [[Massachusetts]] for the [[Boston Tea Party]].

===19th century===
The principle of collective punishment was laid out by Union General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in his [[Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 120|Special Field Order 120]], November 9, 1864, which laid out the rules for his [[Sherman's March to the Sea|"March to the sea"]] in the [[American Civil War]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;V. To army corps commanders alone is entrusted the power to destroy mills, houses, cotton-gins, etc..., and for them this general principle is laid down: In districts and neighborhoods where the army is unmolested, no destruction of such property should be permitted; but should guerrillas or bushwhackers molest our march, or should the inhabitants burn bridges, obstruct roads, or otherwise manifest local hostility, then army commanders should order and enforce a devastation more or less relentless according to the measure of such hostility.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman, William T.]], ''[http://www.sonshi.com/sherman.html Memoirs of General W.T. Sherman]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', 2nd ed., D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1913 (1889), Chapter XXI. Reprinted by the [[Library of America]], 1990, {{ISBN|0-940450-65-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

British forces in the [[Boer Wars]] and the Germans in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] justified such actions as being in accord with the laws of war then in force.&lt;ref&gt;"The laws of war as to conquered territory" by William Miller Collier, New York Times, November 29, 1914, p. SM6&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
====United States====
In 1906, [[Brownsville Affair|167 black U.S. soldiers stationed]] in Brownsville, Texas, were dishonorably discharged on orders of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in response to the shooting of two white citizens in the middle of the night of August 13, 1906. One man was killed and the other, a police lieutenant, was injured and it was never discovered who the shooter(s) were, though they were presumed to have been members of the nearby Fort Brown.  The soldiers of Companies Bravo, Charlie, and Delta of the 25th infantry regiment, many of whom served in the [[Philippines]] and [[Cuba]] during [[Spanish–American War|America's war with Spain]], were punished for the crime collectively and were denied army pensions.&lt;ref&gt;"The Brownsville Raid" by John D. Weaver&lt;/ref&gt;

====World War I====
During the [[First World War]], the German [[Rape of Belgium|invasion of Belgium]] was marked by numerous acts of collective punishment, in response to real or perceived acts of resistance. Some 6,000 civilians were killed, and 25,000 homes burned during this period.&lt;ref name="Lipkes"&gt;Lipkes J. (2007) ''Rehearsals: The German Army in Belgium, August 1914'', Leuven University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}

====Russian Revolution====
During the 1917 uprising against [[Nicholas II]] during [[World War I]], many of Nicholas' distant relatives in Russia were killed
by revolutionaries during that year's uprising. In July 1918, less than a year after the [[October revolution]] that overthrew [[Alexander Kerensky]]'s [[Russian Provisional Government]] and early in the [[Russian Civil War]] that began shortly afterwards, Nicholas II and his immediate family and remaining servants were shot by their captors.{{fact?|date=February 2017}}

During the [[Nazi occupation of Poland]], the Germans applied collective responsibility: any kind of help given to a person of Jewish faith or origin was punishable by death, and that not only for the rescuers themselves but also for their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/stories/ulma.asp|title=Jozef &amp; Wiktoria Ulma – The Righteous Among The Nations – Yad Vashem|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/stories/wegrzynowska.asp|title=Vasiuta Wegrzynowska and her children – Righteous Among the Nations|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/stories/wolska.asp|title=Malgorzata Wolska and her children – Righteous Among the Nations|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was widely publicized by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citinet.net/ak/polska.php?Page=27&amp;Lang=EN|title=Info|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235753/http://www.citinet.net/ak/polska.php?Page=27&amp;Lang=EN|archive-date=March 3, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2today.com/19th-june-1943-the-nazi-abuse-of-the-polish-people-continues|title=19th June 1943: The Nazi abuse of the Polish people continues|work=WWII Today|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the occupation, for every German killed by a Pole, 100–400 Poles were shot in retribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectinposterum.org/docs/survivors_print.htm|title=Project InPosterum: Forgotten Survivors.

Total: 5.6 million."&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany also applied collective punishment elsewhere. In the summer of 1941, [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] troops executed several hundred people in [[Massacre of Kondomari|Kondomari]], [[Alikianos executions|Alikianos]], [[Razing of Kandanos|Kandanos]] and elsewhere in retaliation for the participation of [[Crete|Cretan]] civilians in the [[Battle of Crete]]. During its [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupation]] by the Axis from 1941 to 1944, [[Greece]] suffered a remarkably high death toll due to reprisals against the support and involvement of the population in the [[Greek Resistance|Resistance]]. Large-scale massacres were carried out in places such as [[Domenikon Massacre|Domeniko]], [[Kommeno]], [[Holocaust of Viannos|Viannos]], [[Drakeia massacre|Drakeia]], [[Massacre of Kalavryta|Kalavryta]], [[Mesovouno massacres|Mesovouno]], [[Distomo massacre|Distomo]], [[Holocaust of Kedros|Kedros]], [[The Massacre of Chortiatis|Chortiatis]] and many others.

In Yugoslavia (now [[Serbia]]), Nazi troops killed 434 men in three villages near Kragujevac on October 19, 1941 as punishment for previous actions of the Serbian resistance movement. In the next two days, the Nazis also killed more than 13,000 people in Kraljevo, Kragujevac, and Sumarice, including 300 students from Kragujevac First High School. In 1942, the Germans destroyed the village of [[Lidice]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (now the [[Czech Republic]]) killing 340 inhabitants as collective punishment or [[reprisal]] for that year's assassination of [[Reinhard Heydrich]] by nearby commandos (the village [[Ležáky]] was also destroyed in retribution). In the French village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] 642 of its inhabitants – men, women, and children – were slaughtered by the German [[Waffen-SS]] in 1944, as were 335 Italians in that same year's [[Ardeatine massacre]] in caves outside Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9057248/Oradour-sur-Glane|title=Oradour-sur-Glane|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Dutch village of [[Putten]]&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.putten.nl Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Italian villages of [[Sant'Anna di Stazzema]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/world/italian-town-lost-in-history-now-fears-memories-of-nazis.html|title=Italian Town, Lost in History, Now Fears Memories of Nazis|first=Clifford J.|last=Levy|date=April 18, 2004|publisher=|accessdate=December 18, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marzabotto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~gduncan/massacres_axis.html#Italy|title=Massacres and Atrocities of WWII in the Axis Countries|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194232/http://members.iinet.net.au/~gduncan/massacres_axis.html#Italy|archive-date=March 3, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the Soviet village of [[Kortelisy]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ukrhistory.tripod.com/page-20.html World War II in Ukraine] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64HKWGqzR?url=http://ukrhistory.tripod.com/page-20.html |date=December 28, 2011 }}: Kortelisy (Ukraine), Lidice (Czechoslovakia) &amp; Oradour-sur-Glane (France): Razed Villages.''&lt;/ref&gt; (in what is now [[Ukraine]]), large-scale reprisal killings were carried out by the Germans. The Massacre of Borovë occurred on July 9, 1943, in the village of Borovë, in southeastern Albania. German forces killed 107 civilians as a reprisal for a partisan attack on a German convoy the days before.

=====Against Germany=====
The [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expulsion of German speaking population groups after World War II]] by the Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia represent one of the greatest examples of collective punishment in terms of the number of victims. The goal was to punish the Germans;&lt;ref name="Ulf Brunnbauer p.91"&gt;Ulf Brunnbauer, Michael G. Esch, Holm Sundhaussen, ''Definitionsmacht, Utopie, Vergeltung'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EU6&gt;''[http://cadmus.iue.it/dspace/bitstream/1814/2599/1/HEC04-01.pdf The Expulsion of 'German' Communities from Eastern Europe at the end of the Second World War]'', Steffen Prauser and Arfon Rees, European University Institute, Florence.

Nicosia p.130,131"&gt;Francis R.

Nicosia p.130,131"/&gt;

====British Empire====
According to ''The New York Times'', the British planned "'collective punishment' for aiding Reds, rewards and more troops" in Malaya in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;"British to step up Malaya campaign; 1951 plans include 'collective punishment' for aiding Reds, rewards and more troops" New York Times, December 17, 1950, p 12&lt;/ref&gt; The British used collective punishment as an official policy to suppress the [[Mau Mau]] uprising in Kenya in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;"Labor's censure over Kenya fails" New York Times, December 17, 1952, p16&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Britain officially used collective punishment in [[Cyprus]] in the form of evicting families from their homes and closing shops anywhere British soldiers and police had been murdered, to obtain information about the identities of the attackers.&lt;ref&gt;Britain punishes Cypriote balking in informer role" New York Times, March 17, 1956, p1&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is considered by most nations contradictory to the modern concept of [[due process]], where each individual receives separate treatment based on their own role(s) in the crime in question. Article 33 of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] specifically forbids collective punishment.

====USSR====
[[Joseph Stalin]]'s mass [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations]] of many nationalities of the USSR to remote regions (including the [[Chechen people|Chechens]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Volga Germans]] and many others) is an example of officially orchestrated collective punishment.

The partial removal of potentially trouble-making ethnic groups was a technique used consistently by Stalin during his career: [[Poles]] (1939–41 and 1944–45), [[Romanians]] (1941 and 1944–53), [[Estonians]], [[Latvians]], [[Lithuanians]] (1941 and 1945–49), [[Volga Germans]] (1941), [[Chechen people|Chechens]], and [[Ingush people|Ingushes]] (1944). Shortly before, during and immediately after [[World War II]], Stalin conducted a series of deportations on a huge scale which profoundly affected the ethnic map of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sovietinfo.tripod.com/WCR-German_Soviet.pdf |title=The Scale and Nature of German and Soviet Repression and Mass Killings, 1930–45|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that between 1941 and 1949 nearly 3.3&amp;nbsp;million were deported to Siberia and the Central Asian republics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Boobbyer|title=The Stalin Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYMsIE5KjmMC&amp;pg=PA130|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-18298-0|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; By some estimates up to 43% of the resettled population died of [[infectious disease|diseases]] and [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/USSR.TAB1B.GIF|title=Soviet Transit, Camp, and Deportation Death Rates|publisher=|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deportations started with Poles from [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and European Russia (see [[Poles in the former Soviet Union]]) 1932–36. [[Koryo-saram|Koreans]] in the [[Russian Far East]] were deported in 1937 (see [[Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union]]). After the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] following the corresponding [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion]] that marked the start of [[World War II]] in 1939, the [[Soviet Union]] annexed eastern parts (so-called "''[[Kresy]]''") of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. During 1939–41 1.45&amp;nbsp;million people inhabiting the region were deported by the Soviet regime, of whom 63% were [[Poles]], and 7% were [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;Poland's Holocaust, Tadeusz Piotrowski, 1998 {{ISBN|0-7864-0371-3}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The same followed in the [[Baltic states]] of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.am.gov.lv/en/latvia/History-of-Occupation/briefing-paper4/ Soviet Mass Deportations from Latvia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709020049/http://www.am.gov.lv/en/latvia/History-of-Occupation/briefing-paper4/ |date=July 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200,000 people are estimated to have been deported from the Baltic in 1940–1953. 10% of the entire adult Baltic population was deported or sent to labor camps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahtg.net/TpA/baltstat.html The Baltic States] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420175950/http://www.ahtg.net/TpA/baltstat.html |date=April 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rel.ee/eng/communism_crimes.htm|title=Taig|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010301223347/http://www.rel.ee/eng/communism_crimes.htm|archivedate=March 1, 2001|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[June deportation]], [[Operation Priboi]], [[Soviet deportations from Estonia]]) [[Volga Germans]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volgagermans.net/volgagermans/Volga%20German%20Deportation.htm Deportation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806104429/http://www.volgagermans.net/volgagermans/Volga%20German%20Deportation.htm |date=August 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and seven (overwhelmingly [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] or non-[[Slavic Peoples|Slavic]]) nationalities of the [[Crimea]] and the northern [[Caucasus]] were deported: the [[Crimean Tatars]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronet.nl/users/sota/statshist.html Deportation of Crimean Tatars by Stalin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015035819/http://www.euronet.nl/users/sota/statshist.html |date=October 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kalmykia|Kalmyks]], [[Chechens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3509933.stm|title=Remembering Stalin's deportations|publisher=BBC News – Europe|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ingushetia|Ingush]], [[Balkars]], [[Karachays]], and [[Meskhetian Turks]]. All [[Crimean Tatars]] were deported ''en masse'', in a form of collective punishment.

[[Pogrom]]s may be considered examples of unofficial collective punishment which resemble rioting. About 14 million East Germans were moved out of what was Germany; three million of them died.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

====Azerbaijan====
[[Black January]] was a [[List of events named massacres|massacre]] of civilians committed by the [[Red Army]] in the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1990. The [[Human Rights Watch]] report entitled "Black January in Azerbaijan" states: "Indeed, the violence used by the Soviet Army on the night of January 19–20 was so out of proportion to the resistance offered by Azerbaijanis as to constitute an exercise in collective punishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azembassy.ro/eng/news/press_releases/002.htm|title=Embassy of the Republic of Azerbaijanin Romania|first=|last=FS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====North Korea====
In [[North Korea]], political prisoners are sent to the [[Kwan-li-so]] concentration camps along with their relatives without any fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/10/AR2008121003855.html |title="Escapee Tells of Horrors in North Korean Prison Camp", Washington Post, December&amp;nbsp;11, 2008 |work=The Washington Post  |date= December 11, 2008|accessdate=August 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korean citizens convicted of more serious political crimes are sentenced to life imprisonment, and the summary two generations of their family (children and grandchildren) will be born in the camps as part of the "3 generations of punishment" policy instigated by state founder [[Kim Il-Sung]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kaechon internment camp]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[North Korea]]'s [[political imprisonment|political]] [[penal labor]] [[Penal colony|colonies]], transliterated ''kwalliso'' or ''kwan-li-so'', constitute one of three forms of political imprisonment in the country, the other two being what Hawk (2012)&lt;ref name="Hawk2012"&gt;{{cite web | author=Hawk, David|title=The Hidden Gulag – Exposing North Korea's Prison Camps| work=[[U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea|The Committee for Human Rights in North Korea]] | url= http://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/HRNK_HiddenGulag2_Web_5-18.pdf | accessdate=2012-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; translates as "short-term [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]]/forced-labor centers"&lt;ref&gt;{{Korean|context=north|mr=chipkyŏlso|rr=jipgyeolso|hangul=집결소|hanja=[[wikt:集結#Korean|集結]] [[wikt:所|所]]}}, literally "place(s) of gathering"&lt;/ref&gt; and "long-term prison [[labor camp]]s"&lt;ref&gt;{{Korean|context=north|mr=kyohwaso|rr=gyohwaso|hangul=교화소|hanja=[[wikt:敎|敎]] [[wikt:化|化]]所}}, literally "place(s) of [[:wikt:reeducation|reeducation]]"&lt;/ref&gt; for [[misdemeanor]] and [[felony]] offences respectively. In total, there are an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 political prisoners housed within the [[Prisons in North Korea|North Korean imprisonment system]].&lt;ref name="Hawk2012" /&gt; In contrast to these other systems, the condemned are sent there without any form of [[judicial process]] as are their immediate three generations of family members as [[kin punishment]].
North Korea's kwalliso consist of a series of sprawling encampments measuring kilometers long and kilometers wide. The number of these encampments has varied over time. They are located mainly in the valleys between high mountains, mostly in the northern provinces of North Korea. There are between 5,000 and 50,000 prisoners per kwalliso, totaling perhaps some 150,000 to 200,000 prisoners throughout North Korea. The kwalliso are usually surrounded at their outer perimeters by barbed-wire fences punctuated with guard towers and patrolled by heavily armed guards. The encampments include self-contained closed "village" compounds for single persons, usually the alleged wrongdoers, and other closed, fenced-in "villages" for the extended families of the wrongdoers.

The current [[2007–present blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade of Gaza]] has been criticized by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], in a United Nations report, and by various other organisations as collective punishment aimed at the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8257301.stm | work=BBC News | title=UN condemns 'war crimes' in Gaza | date=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10306193 | work=BBC News | title=ICRC says Israel's Gaza blockade breaks law | date=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15163640 | work=BBC News | title=US Congress freeze on $200m Palestinian aid criticised | date=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Alamarin v. IDF Commander in Gaza Strip]] the Israeli [[High Court of Justice]] held that [[House demolition in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict|the homes of Palestinians]] who have committed violent acts may be demolished under the [[Defence (Emergency) Regulations]], even if the residence has other inhabitants who are unconnected to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite IsrSC |court=HCJ|number=2722/92|case=Alamarin v. IDF Commander in the Gaza Strip|vol=46|part=3|reporter=PD|page=693|date=1992|url=http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/92/220/027/Z03/92027220.z03.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
The [[1984 anti-Sikh riots]] or the 1984 Sikh Massacre was a riot directed against Sikhs in India, by anti-Sikh mobs, in response to the [[assassination of Indira Gandhi]] by her Sikh bodyguards. This caused more than 3000 deaths. The CBI is of the opinion that the acts of violence were well organized with support from the officials in the Delhi police and central government at the time, headed by [[Indira Gandhi]]'s son, Rajiv Gandhi. Rajiv, a [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] member who was sworn in as the Prime Minister after his mother's death, when asked about the riots said "When a big tree falls, the earth shakes".

In 2011, Human Rights Watch reported the Government of India had "yet to prosecute those responsible for the mass killings". The 2011 WikiLeaks cable leaks revealed that the United States was convinced regarding the complicity of the Indian government led by the [[Indian National Congress]] in the riots, and termed it as "opportunism" and "hatred" of the Congress government against Sikhs. Also in 2011, a new set of mass graves were discovered in Haryana, and Human Rights Watch reported that "Widespread anti-Sikh attacks in Haryana were part of broader revenge attacks" in India.

====Pakistan====
On May 20, 2008, the [[Pakistan Army]] conducted collective punishment against a village called [[Spinkai]], located in the frontier province of [[Pakistan]]. The operation was called 'zalzala', which is Arabic for earthquake. At first, the Pakistan Army swept through with helicopter gunships, artillery and tanks. After four days of heavy fighting, 25 militants and six soldiers died. The rest of the militants retreated up the valley. After the capture of the village the army discovered bomb factories, detonation-ready suicide jackets and schools for teenage suicide bombers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/20/pakistan|title=Demolished by the Pakistan army: the frontier village punished for harboring the Taliban|work=The Guardian|author=Declan Walsh|date=May 20, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-30|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pakistan Army immediately decided to punish the village for harboring the [[Taliban]] and allowing the militants to operate in and from the village to conduct further terror attacks in Pakistan. Bulldozers and explosives experts turned Spinkai's bazaar into a mile-long pile of rubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/in_pictures/7421903.stm|title=In pictures: Pakistan's most feared militant|work=BBC News (news.bbc.co.uk)|accessdate=2008-06-30|date=May 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrol stations, shops, and even parts of the hospital were leveled or blown up. The villagers were forbidden from returning to their homes.

Pakistani commanders, who were speaking to the media, insisted they had been merciful in their application of "collective punishment" – a practice invented by the British who demarcated the tribal areas over a century ago.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

====South Africa====
South Africa still retains the [[Apartheid]]-era law of [[common purpose]], by which those who make up part of a group can be punished for the crimes of other group members, even if they were not themselves actively involved. In August 2012 this came to public attention when 270 miners were threatened with prosecution for participating in a demonstration. During the demonstration at the Marikana mine, 34 miners were shot by police. Many of the miners were armed. When prosecutors said they would pursue charges against other miners who were part of the protest, there was a public outcry.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19438343 | title=Marikana murder charges: South Africa minister wants explanation | publisher=BBC | accessdate=August 31, 2012 | date=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syria====
Throughout most of Syria's ongoing [[Syrian civil war|civil war]], collective punishment has been a recurring method used by the Syrian government to quell opposition cities and suburbs throughout the country, whereby entire cities are besieged, shelled, and destroyed if that city is deemed as pro-opposition.

Upon retaking the capital Damascus after the [[Battle of Damascus (2012)]], the Syrian government began a campaign of collective punishment against Sunni suburbs in-and-around the capital which had supported FSA presence in their neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/03/us-syria-crisis-bulldozers-idUSBRE8820BC20120903 | work=Reuters | title=Syria army destroys houses in "collective punishment" | date=September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Syria+army+bulldozes+houses+Sunni+Muslim+areas+collective+punishment/7187238/story.html  accessdate=2012-09-26] {{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition-controlled cities and districts in Aleppo province and Aleppo city, reports indicate that the Syrian government is attacking civilians at bread bakeries with artillery rounds and rockets, with the reports indicating that the bakeries were shelled indiscriminately.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/30/us-syria-crisis-rights-idUSBRE87T0HE20120rian{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/human-rights-watch/syria-government-attackin_b_1843391.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Syria: Government Attacking Bread Lines | date=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; HRW said these are war crimes, as the only military targets wherever the few rebels manning the bakeries, and that dozens of civilians were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/08/31/235232.html|title=Syrian fighters in Aleppo form 'Revolutionary Transitional Council'|first=|last=0|website=english.alarabiya.net|accessdate=December 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906212123/http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/08/31/235232.html|archive-date=September 6, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Idlib province in the northwest of the country, entire cities were shelled and bombed for sheltering opposition activists and rebels, with the victims mostly civilians, along with heavy financial losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmiE4APsHuk&amp;feature=plcp|title=Idlib town suffers heavy bombing|date=September 12, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
Rather than attempt to discover some "contra-causal free will", modern philosophers will usually use notions of [[intention]] to establish individual moral responsibility. This [[Kantian ethics|Kantian]] approach may not be the only way to assess responsibility, especially considering groups may need a unique approach to individuals.&lt;ref name=StanfordCollective&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collective-responsibility/#5 Collective Responsibility. At Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. First published Mon August 8, 2005; substantive revision Mon June 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, there is the issue that consistent (not [[hypocritical]]) individuals may nevertheless experience a [[discursive dilemma]] when they try to act as a group.

Philosopher Kenneth Shockley suggests we focus on group faults and the punishments that would bring change. Punishments, for a group, might include: full or partial disbanding, weakening bonds between members, or de-institutionalizing some of the group's norms. Neta Crawford says groups can be expected to change, but also apologize and make amends. That might mean groups must forfeit important parts of themselves.&lt;ref name=StanfordCollective/&gt; In this case, groups are being held responsible for organizing or incentivizing harmful behaviors. Shockley calls this the group's "coordinating control" over members. He says group responsibility can mitigate individual responsibility.&lt;ref name=StanfordCollective/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5207">'''Colon classification''' ('''CC''') is a system of [[library classification]] developed by [[S. R. Ranganathan]]. It was the first ever [[Faceted classification|faceted]] (or analytico-synthetic) [[Taxonomic classification|classification]]. The first edition was published in 1933. Since then six more editions have been published. It is especially used in [[library|libraries]] in [[India]].

Its name "colon classification" comes from the use of [[Colon (punctuation)|colons]] to separate facets in class numbers. However, many other classification schemes, some of which are completely unrelated, also use colons and other [[punctuation]] in various functions.

In CC, facets describe "personality" (the most specific subject), matter, energy, space, and time (PMEST).  These facets are generally associated with every item in a library, and so form a reasonably universal sorting system.&lt;ref&gt;GOPINATH (M A). Colon classification: Its theory and practice.

As an example, the subject "research in the cure of tuberculosis of lungs by x-ray conducted in India in 1950" would be categorized as:

:Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research.India'1950

This is summarized in a specific call number:

:L,45;421:6;253:f.44'N5

== Organization ==

The colon classification uses 42 main classes that are combined with other letters, numbers and marks in a manner resembling the [[Library of Congress Classification]] to sort a publication.

=== Facets ===

CC uses five primary categories, or facets, to further specify the sorting of a publication. Collectively, they are called ''PMEST'':

:&lt;nowiki&gt;,&lt;/nowiki&gt; Personality, the most specific or focal subject.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Matter or property, the substance, properties or materials of the subject.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Energy, including the processes, operations and activities.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;.&lt;/nowiki&gt; Space, which relates to the geographic location of the subject.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; Time, which refers to the dates or seasons of the subject.

=== Classes ===

The following are the main classes of CC, with some subclasses, the main method used to sort the subclass using the PMEST scheme and examples showing application of PMEST.

== Example ==

A common example of the colon classification is:

* "Research in the cure of the tuberculosis of lungs by x-ray conducted in India in 1950s":
* Main classification is Medicine
** (Medicine)
* Within Medicine, the Lungs are the main concern
** (Medicine,Lungs)
* The property of the Lungs is that they are afflicted with Tuberculosis
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis)
* The Tuberculosis is being performed (:) on, that is the intent is to cure (Treatment)
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment)
* The matter that we are treating the Tuberculosis with are X-Rays
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray)
* And this discussion of treatment is regarding the Research phase
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research)
* This Research is performed within a geographical space (.) namely India
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research.India)
* During the time (') of 1950
** (Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research.India'1950)
* And translating into the codes listed for each subject and facet the classification becomes
** L,45;421:6;253:f.44'N5

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2764">In law, a '''commanding precedent''' is a [[precedent]] whose facts are "on all fours" with the case at hand. In other words, it almost exactly tracks it, sharing near-identical facts and issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Precedent: What it is and What it Isn't; When Do We Kiss it and When Do We Kill it?|author=Ruggero J. Aldisert|publisher=Pepperdine Law Review|volume=17|number=605|date=1990|ssrn=1410783}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commanding precedent is also referred to as a "Goose" case in [[Louisiana]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=United States v.

Texas|vol=632|reporter=S.W.2d|opinion=734|court=Tex.Crim.App.|date=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; A legal rule can be "clearly established" without commanding precedent existing. For example, in the United States, a governmental official is generally protected by [[qualified immunity]] if his acts were objectively legally reasonable, but such protection may not apply if, in light of pre-existing law, the unlawfulness of his conduct would have been apparent to a reasonably competent official, even if no commanding precedent applicable to his specific behavior existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Morris v. Dearborne|date=July 16, 1999|url=http://openjurist.org/181/f3d/657/jim-morris-gloria-morris-v-charlotte-hawkins-dearborne-et-al|vol=181|reporter=F3d|opinion=657|court=5th Cir.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a precedent is called '''on all fours''' when all four parts of the instant (or present) case are essentially the same as the mandatory precedent, or are very similar:
# The parties are the same, or have such great similarities as to have exactly the same standing.
# The circumstances involving the two cases are materially the same, or are so similar as not to matter.
# The issue is exactly the same, or if more than one issue exists, they are materially the same types.
# The remedy the plaintiff or petitioner seeks is of the same kind as in the past case.

By comparison, a '''case on point''' is one in which a case has factual circumstances and issues similar to the case being researched, but which has different parties seeking somewhat different remedies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9557">: ''For complementary sequences in biology, see [[complementarity (molecular biology)]].''
In applied mathematics, '''complementary sequences''' ('''CS''') are pairs of [[sequence]]s with the useful property that their out-of-phase aperiodic [[autocorrelation]] coefficients sum to zero. Binary complementary sequences were first introduced by [[Marcel J. E. Golay]] in 1949. In 1961–1962 Golay gave several methods for constructing sequences of length 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; and gave examples of complementary sequences of lengths 10 and 26.  In 1974 R. J. Turyn gave a method for constructing sequences of length ''mn'' from sequences of lengths ''m'' and ''n'' which allows the construction of sequences of any length of the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;''K''&lt;/sup&gt;26&lt;sup&gt;''M''&lt;/sup&gt;.

Later the theory of complementary sequences was generalized by other authors to polyphase complementary sequences, multilevel complementary sequences, and arbitrary complex complementary sequences. '''Complementary sets''' have also been considered; these can contain more than two sequences.

== Definition ==

Let (''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;) be a pair of bipolar sequences, meaning that ''a''(''k'') and ''b''(''k'') have values +1 or &amp;minus;1. Let the aperiodic [[autocorrelation function]] of the sequence '''x''' be defined by

:&lt;math&gt;R_x(k)=\sum_{j=0}^{N-k-1} x_jx_{j+k}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then the pair of sequences ''a'' and ''b'' is complementary if:

:&lt;math&gt;R_a(k) + R_b(k) = 0,\, &lt;/math&gt;

for ''k'' = 1, ..., ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

Or using [[Kronecker delta]] we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;R_a(k) + R_b(k) = 2N\delta(k),\, &lt;/math&gt;

So we can say that the sum of autocorrelation functions of complementary sequences is a delta function, which is an ideal autocorrelation for many applications like [[radar]] [[pulse compression]] and [[spread spectrum]] [[telecommunications]].

== Examples ==

* As the simplest example we have sequences of length 2: (+1,&amp;nbsp;+1) and (+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1). Their autocorrelation functions are (2,&amp;nbsp;1) and (2,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1), which add up to (4,&amp;nbsp;0).
* As the next example (sequences of length 4), we have (+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1) and (+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1). Their autocorrelation functions are (4,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1) and (4,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1), which add up to (8,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0).
* One example of length 8 is (+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1) and (+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1). Their autocorrelation functions are (8,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1) and (8,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;3,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1).
* An example of length 10 given by Golay is (+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1) and (+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1). Their autocorrelation functions are (10,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;3,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;minus;2,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;1) and (10,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;2,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1).

== Properties of complementary pairs of sequences ==

* Complementary [[sequences]] have complementary spectra. As the autocorrelation function and the power spectra form a Fourier pair, complementary sequences also have complementary spectra. But as the Fourier transform of a delta function is a constant, we can write

:: &lt;math&gt;S_a + S_b = C_S,&lt;/math&gt;

: where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant.

: ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; are defined as a squared magnitude of the [[Fourier transform]] of the sequences. The Fourier transform can be a direct DFT of the sequences, it can be a DFT of zero padded sequences or it can be a continuous Fourier transform of the sequences which is equivalent to the [[Z transform]] for {{math|1=''Z'' = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''j''ω&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

* CS spectra is upper bounded. As ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; are non-negative values we can write

:: &lt;math&gt;S_a = C_S - S_b &lt; C_S,&lt;/math&gt;

: also

:: &lt;math&gt;S_b &lt; C_S.&lt;/math&gt;

* If either of the sequences of the CS pair is inverted (multiplied by −1) they remain complementary. More generally if any of the sequences is multiplied by ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''j''φ&lt;/sup&gt; they remain complementary;
* If either of the sequences is reversed they remain complementary;
* If either of the sequences is delayed they remain complementary;
* If the sequences are interchanged they remain complementary;
* If both sequences are multiplied by the same constant (real or complex) they remain complementary;
* If both sequences are decimated in time by ''K'' they remain complementary. More precisely if from a complementary pair (''a''(''k''), ''b''(''k'')) we form a new pair (''a''(''Nk''), ''b''(''Nk'')) with skipped samples discarded then the new sequences are complementary.
* If alternating bits of both sequences are inverted they remain complementary. In general for arbitrary complex sequences if both sequences are multiplied by ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&amp;pi;''kn''/''N''&lt;/sup&gt; (where ''k'' is a constant and ''n'' is the time index) they remain complementary;
* A new pair of complementary sequences can be formed as [''a'' ''b''] and [''a''&amp;nbsp;−''b''] where [..] denotes concatenation and ''a'' and ''b'' are a pair of CS;
* A new pair of sequences can be formed as {''a'' ''b''} and {''a''&amp;nbsp;−''b''} where {..} denotes [[Interleave sequence|interleaving]] of sequences.
* A new pair of sequences can be formed as ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'' and ''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b''.

==Golay pair==
A complementary pair ''a'', ''b'' may be encoded as polynomials ''A''(''z'') = ''a''(0) + ''a''(1)''z'' + ... + ''a''(''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)''z''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; and similarly for ''B''(''z'').  The complementarity property of the sequences is equivalent to the condition

:&lt;math&gt;\vert A(z) \vert^2 + \vert B(z) \vert^2 = 2N \, &lt;/math&gt;

for all ''z'' on the unit circle, that is, |''z''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  If so, ''A'' and ''B'' form a '''Golay pair''' of polynomials.  Examples include the [[Shapiro polynomials]], which give rise to complementary sequences of length a power of&amp;nbsp;2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="76611">'''Embodied cognition''' is the theory that many features of [[cognition]], whether human or otherwise, are shaped by aspects of the entire body of the organism. The features of cognition include high level mental constructs (such as [[concept]]s and [[Categorization|categories]]) and performance on various cognitive tasks (such as reasoning or judgment). The aspects of the body include the [[motor system]], the [[perceptual system]], bodily interactions with the environment ([[situated]]ness) and the assumptions about the world that are built into the structure of the organism.

The embodied mind thesis challenges other theories, such as [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], [[computationalism]], and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]].&lt;ref name=WilsonRA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Varela|Thompson|Rosch|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is closely related to the [[extended mind thesis]], [[situated cognition]] and [[enactivism]]. The modern version depends on insights drawn from recent research in [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[Cognitive model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[robotics]], [[animal cognition]], [[plant cognition]] and [[neurobiology]].

==Embodiment thesis==
In [[philosophy]], embodied cognition holds that an agent's [[cognition]] is strongly influenced by aspects of an agent's body beyond the brain itself.&lt;ref name=WilsonRA&gt;
{{cite web |author1=Wilson, Robert A.  |author2=Foglia, Lucia |title=Embodied Cognition |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition)|editor=Edward N. Zalta |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/embodied-cognition/  |date=July 25, 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In their proposal for an [[Enactivism|enactive approach]] to cognition Varela ''et al.'' defined "embodied":&lt;ref name=VarelaF&gt;
{{cite book |title=The embodied mind: Cognitive science and human experience |publisher=MIT Press |year=1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QY4RoH2z5DoC&amp;pg=PA172 |isbn=978-0262720212 |edition=Paperback 1992 |author1=Eleanor Rosch |author2=Evan Thompson |author3=Francisco J. Varela }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
:"By using the term ''embodied'' we mean to highlight two points: first that cognition depends upon the kinds of experience that come from having a body with various sensorimotor capacities, and second, that these individual sensorimotor capacities are themselves embedded in a more encompassing biological, psychological and cultural context."
:::—  Eleanor Rosch, Evan Thompson, Francisco J. Varela: ''The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience'' pages 172–173

The Varela enactive definition is broad enough to overlap the views of [[extended cognition]] and [[situated cognition]], and indeed, these ideas are not always carefully separated.

Some authors explain the dependence of cognition upon the body and its environmental interactions by saying cognition in real biological systems is not an end in itself but is constrained by the system's goals and capacities. However, they argue, such constraints do not mean cognition is set by adaptive behavior (or [[autopoiesis]]) alone, but cognition requires “''some'' kind of information processing...the transformation or communication of incoming information”, the acquiring of which involves "exploration and modification of the environment".&lt;ref name= Milkowski&gt;
{{cite book |title=Explaining the Computational Mind |author= Marcin Milkowski |page=4 |isbn=9780262018869 |year=2013 |publisher=MIT Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxH7eOEmlC4C&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=%22transformation+or+communication+of+incoming+information%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BRvuVMa3D4urogSNo4CoBA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22transformation%20or%20communication%20of%20incoming%20information%22&amp;f=false}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that cognition consists simply of building maximally accurate representations of input information...the gaining of knowledge is a stepping stone to achieving the more immediate goal of guiding behavior in response to the system's changing surroundings."
:::— Marcin Miłkowski: ''Explaining the Computational Mind'', p. 4

The separation of embodied cognition from [[extended cognition]] and [[situated cognition]] can be based upon the ''embodiment thesis'', a narrower view of embodiment than that of Varela ''et al.'' or that of Dawson:&lt;ref name=WilsonRA/&gt;
:'''''Embodiment thesis:''''' Many features of cognition are embodied in that they are deeply dependent upon characteristics of the physical body of an agent, such that the agent's beyond-the-brain body plays a significant causal role, or a physically constitutive role, in that agent's cognitive processing. 
:::—RA Wilson and L Foglia,  ''Embodied Cognition'' in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy

This thesis omits direct mention of some aspects of the "more encompassing biological, psychological and cultural context" included by Varela ''et al.'' The [[Extended mind thesis|''&lt;u&gt;Extended&lt;/u&gt;'' mind thesis]], in contrast with the &lt;u&gt;''Embodiment''&lt;/u&gt; thesis, limits cognitive processing neither to the brain nor even to the body, but extends it outward into the agent's world.&lt;ref name=WilsonRA/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChalmersD&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; ''&lt;u&gt;Situated&lt;/u&gt;'' cognition emphasizes that this extension is not just a matter of including resources outside the head, but stresses the role of probing and modifying interaction with the agent's world.&lt;ref name=ClarkA&gt;

In his ''[[Universal Natural History and Theory of Heaven]]'' (1755).&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], ''Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens'', p.367; translated by Stephen Palmquist in [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp2 Kant's Critical Religion] (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000), p.320.&lt;/ref&gt; philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] advocated a view of the [[mind–body problem]] and the [[subject–object problem]] with parallels to the embodied view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Andrew Carpenter |title= Kant on the embodied cognition |url=http://journals.ut.ac.ir/pdf_28259_26f2aefa9b23b767d721f1e94459c224.html |journal= فلسفه |volume=36 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=59–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some difficulties with this interpretation of Kant include (i) the view that Kant holds the empirical, and specifically knowledge of the body, cannot support ''a priori'' transcendental claims,&lt;ref name=RoschE&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and (ii) the view that Kant holds that transcendental philosophy, although charged with the responsibility of explaining how we can have empirical knowledge, is not itself empirical.&lt;ref name= SvareH&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[George Santayana]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Martin Heidegger]] and others in the broadly [[Existentialism|existential]] tradition have proposed philosophies of mind influencing the development of the modern 'embodiment' thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Cowart, Monica 2004 Embodied Cognition
The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, {{ISSN|2161-0002}}, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/embodcog/], retrieved 27 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The embodiment movement in [[artificial intelligence]] has fueled the embodiment argument in philosophy and a revised view of [[ethology]]:&lt;ref name=Hendriks&gt;{{cite book |author= Horst Hendriks-Jansen |year=1996 |title=Catching Ourselves in the Act: Situated Activity, Interactive Emergence, Evolution, and Human Thought |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=9780262082464 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3PzBEBFMFvAC&amp;pg=PA10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Species-typical activity patterns must be thought of as emergent phenomena in three different senses of the word. They have emerged...through natural selection, ....by a process of maturation and/or learning, ...and from interactions between the creature's low-level activities and its species-typical environment."
:::—Horst Hendriks-Jansen   ''Catching Ourselves in the Act'', p. 10

These developments have also given emotions a new status in [[philosophy of mind]] as an indispensable constituent, rather than a non-essential addition to rational intellectual thought.
In philosophy of mind, the idea that cognition is embodied is sympathetic with other views of cognition such as [[situated cognition]] or [[externalism]]. This is a radical move towards a total re-localization of mental processes out of the neural domain.&lt;ref&gt;Di Paolo, Ezequiel

==Connections with the sciences==

Embodied cognition is a topic of research in [[social psychology|social]] and [[cognitive psychology]], covering issues such as [[social interaction]] and [[decision-making]].&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borghi|first1=Anna M.|last2=Cimatti|first2=Felice|title=Embodied cognition and beyond: Acting and sensing the body|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=48|issue=3|year=2010|pages=763–773|issn=0028-3932|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.10.029|pmid=19913041}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Embodied cognition reflects the argument that the [[motor system]] influences our cognition, just as the mind influences bodily actions.  For example, when participants hold a pencil in their teeth engaging the muscles of a smile, they comprehend pleasant sentences faster than unpleasant ones, while holding a pencil between their nose and upper lip to engage the muscles of a frown has the reverse effect.&lt;ref name="Glenberg et al."&gt;{{cite book|author1=Diane Pecher|author2=Rolf A. Zwaan|title=Grounding Cognition: The Role of Perception and Action in Memory, Language, and Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RaxTkckBnh4C&amp;pg=PA115|date=10 January 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44247-3|pages=115–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Lakoff]] (a [[cognitive scientist]] and [[linguistics|linguist]]) and his collaborators (including [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]], [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]], and [[Rafael E. Núñez]]) have written a series of books promoting and expanding the thesis based on discoveries in [[cognitive science]], such as [[conceptual metaphor]] and [[image schema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lakoff|Johnson|1980}}; {{Harvtxt|Lakoff|1987}}; {{Harvtxt|Lakoff|Turner|1989}}; {{Harvtxt|Lakoff|Johnson|1999}}; {{Harvnb|Lakoff|Nunez|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robotic]]s researchers such as [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Hans Moravec]] and [[Rolf Pfeifer]] have argued that true [[artificial intelligence]] can only be achieved by machines that have [[Sensory perception|sensory]] and [[motor skills]] and are connected to the world through a body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}}, {{Harvnb|Brooks|1990}}, {{Harvnb|Pfeiffer|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insights of these robotics researchers have in turn inspired philosophers like [[Andy Clark]] and [[Horst Hendriks-Jansen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|1997}}, {{Harvnb|Hendriks-Jansen|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neurobiology|Neuroscientist]]s [[Gerald Edelman]], [[António Damásio]] and others have outlined the connection between the body, individual structures in the brain and aspects of the mind such as [[consciousness]], [[emotion]], [[self-awareness]] and [[Will (philosophy)|will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edelman|2004}}, {{Harvnb|Damasio|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biology]] has also inspired [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Humberto Maturana]], [[Francisco Varela]], [[Eleanor Rosch]] and [[Evan Thompson]] to develop a closely related version of the idea, which they call [[enactivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maturana|Varela|1987}}, {{Harvnb|Varela|Thompson|Rosch|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[motor theory of speech perception]] proposed by [[Alvin Liberman]] and colleagues at the [[Haskins Laboratories]] argues that the identification of words is embodied in perception of the bodily movements by which spoken words are made.&lt;ref name="Liberman67"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=4170865|year=1967|last1=Liberman|first1=AM|last2=Cooper|first2=FS|last3=Shankweiler|first3=DP|last4=Studdert-Kennedy|first4=M|title=Perception of the speech code|volume=74|issue=6|pages=431–61|journal=Psychological Review|ref=harv|doi=10.1037/h0020279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=4075760|year=1985|last1=Liberman|first1=AM|last2=Mattingly|first2=IG|title=The motor theory of speech perception revised|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–36|journal=Cognition|ref=harv|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(85)90021-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=2643163|year=1989|last1=Liberman|first1=AM|last2=Mattingly|first2=IG|title=A specialization for speech perception|volume=243|issue=4890|pages=489–94|journal=Science|ref=harv|doi=10.1126/science.2643163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liberman00"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10782105|year=2000|last1=Liberman|first1=AM|last2=Whalen|first2=DH|title=On the relation of speech to language|volume=4|issue=5|pages=187–196|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|ref=harv|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01471-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galantucci"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17048719|year=2006|last1=Galantucci|first1=B|last2=Fowler|first2=CA|last3=Turvey|first3=MT|title=The motor theory of speech perception reviewed|volume=13|issue=3|pages=361–77|pmc=2746041|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|ref=harv|doi=10.3758/bf03193857}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In related work at Haskins, Paul Mermelstein, [[Philip Rubin]], [[Louis M. Goldstein|Louis Goldstein]], and colleagues developed [[articulatory synthesis]] tools for computationally modeling the physiology and aeroacoustics of the [[vocal tract]], demonstrating how cognition and perception of speech can be shaped by biological constraints. This was extended into the audio-visual domain by the "talking heads" approach of Eric Vatikiotis-Bateson, Rubin, and other colleagues.

A tone sounded to inform participants which target orientation to find.  Participants kept their eyes on a fixation point until it turned from red to the target color.  The screen then lit up and the participants searched for the target, either pointing to it or grasping it (depending on the block).  There were 2 blocks for pointing and 2 for grasping, with the order counterbalanced.  Each block had 64 trials.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;

Results from the experiment show that accuracy decreases with an increase in the number of distractors.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;  Overall, participants made more orientation errors than color errors.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;  There was no main effect of [[accuracy]] between the pointing and grasping conditions, but participants made significantly fewer orientation errors in the grasping condition than in the pointing condition.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;  Color errors were the same in both conditions.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;  Because orientation is important in grasping an object, these results fit with the researchers' hypothesis that the plan to grasp an object will aid in orientation accuracy.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;  This supports embodied cognition because action intention (planning to grasp an object) can affect visual processing of task-relevant information (orientation).&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;

===Distance perception===

Internal states can affect distance [[perception]], which relates to embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Balcetis E, Dunning D |title=Cognitive dissonance and the perception of natural environments |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=917–21 |year=2007 |pmid=17894610 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02000.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers randomly assigned college student participants to high-choice, low-choice, and control conditions. The high-choice condition signed a “freedom of choice” consent form indicating their decision to wear a [[Carmen Miranda]] costume and walk across a busy area of campus.  Low-choice participants signed an “experimenter choice” consent form, indicating the experimenter assigned the participant to wear the costume.  A control group walked across campus but did not wear a costume.  At the conclusion of the experiment, each participant completed a survey which asked them to estimate the distance they walked.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al"/&gt;

The high-choice participants perceived the distance walked as significantly shorter than participants in the low-choice and control groups, even though they walked the same distance.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  The manipulation caused high-choice participants to feel responsible for the choice to walk in the embarrassing costume.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  This created [[cognitive dissonance]], which refers to a discrepancy between [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  High-choice participants reconciled their thoughts and actions by perceiving the distance as shorter.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  These results show the ability of internal states to affect perception of physical distance moved, which illustrates the reciprocal relationship of the body and mind in embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;

===Perspective===
[[File:Tversky and Hard figure.png|thumb|250px|Graph depicting the percentage of responses by perspective for each photograph condition.]]  
Researchers have found that when making judgements about objects in photographs, people will take the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] of a person in the picture instead of their own.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tversky|first1=Barbara|last2=Hard|first2=Bridgette Martin|title=Embodied and disembodied cognition: Spatial perspective-taking|journal=Cognition|volume=110|issue=1|year=2009|pages=124–129|issn=0010-0277|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2008.10.008|pmid=19056081}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They showed college undergraduate participants 1 of 3 photographs and asked where 1 object in the picture was compared to the other object.  For example, if the 2 objects were an apple and a banana, the participants would have to respond to a question about the location of the apple compared to the banana. The photographs either had no person, a person looking at the object, in this case the banana, or a person reaching for the banana. The photograph and question appeared in a larger set of questionnaires not related to the study.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;

Results show that participants who viewed photographs that included a person were significantly more likely to respond from another's perspective than those who saw photographs with no person.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;  There were no differences in perspective of responses for the person looking versus reaching.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;  Participants who saw the scene without a person were significantly more likely to respond from their own perspective.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;  This means that the presence of a person in the photograph affected the perspective used even though the question focused solely on the two objects.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;  The researchers state that these results suggest ''disembodied'' cognition, in which the participants put themselves into the body of the person in the photograph.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;

===Language comprehension===
{{See also|Embodied language processing}}
Some researchers [[Bi-directional hypothesis of language and action|extend embodied cognition to include language]].&lt;ref name="Paradowski2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB |title=Storytelling in language teaching – re-evaluating the weight of kinaesthetic modality for brain-compatible pedagogy |journal=Storytelling: An Interdisciplinary Journal |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=13–52 |year=2014 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10407960/Storytelling_in_language_teaching_re-evaluating_the_weight_of_kinaesthetic_modality_for_brain-compatible_pedagogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"/&gt; They describe language as a tool that aids in broadening our sense of body.&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"/&gt;  For instance, when asked to identify “this” object, participants most often choose an object near to them.&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"/&gt;  Conversely, when asked to identify “that” object, participants choose an object further away from them.&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"/&gt;  Language allows us to distinguish between distances in more complex ways than the simple perceptual difference between near and far objects.&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"/&gt;

[[File:Olmstead et al. figure.png|thumb|250px|The change in "relative phase shift" for different conditions in the study. Participants had a significantly larger change for "performable" sentences than "inanimate" sentences and swinging only.]]
The motor system is involved in [[language]] comprehension, in this case when sentences were performable by a human, there was a change in participants' overall movement of a [[pendulum]].&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al."&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olmstead AJ, Viswanathan N, Aicher KA, Fowler CA |title=Sentence comprehension affects the dynamics of bimanual coordination: implications for embodied cognition |journal=Q J Exp Psychol (Hove) |volume=62 |issue=12 |pages=2409–17 |year=2009 |pmid=19396732 |doi=10.1080/17470210902846765 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers performed an experiment in which college undergraduate participants swung a pendulum while completing a "sentence judgement task."  Participants would swing the pendulum with both hands for 10 seconds before a prompt and then a sentence would appear on the screen until the participant responded.  In the control condition, participants swung the pendulum without performing the "sentence judgement task."  Each trial had half "plausible" and half "implausible" sentences.  The "plausible" sentences made sense semantically, while the "implausible" ones did not.  The "performable" sentences could be performed by a human, while the "inanimate" sentences could not.  Participants responded by saying "yes" to the "plausible" sentences.&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;

Results show a significant "relative phase shift," or overall change in movement of the swinging pendulum, for the "performable" sentences.&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;  This change did not occur for "inanimate" sentences or the control condition.&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;  The researchers did not expect an overall phase shift, instead they expected a change in the variability of movement, or the "[[standard deviation]] of relative phase shift."&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;  Although not entirely expected, these results support embodied cognition and show that the motor system is involved in the understanding of language.&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;  The researchers suggest that the nature of this relationship needs to be further studied to determine the exact [[correlation]] this task has to bi-manual motor movements.&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;

Embodiment effects emerge in the way in which people of different sex and temperament perceive verbal material, such as common adjectives and abstract and neutral nouns. Trofimova, who first described this phenomenon in her experiments, called it "projection through capacities". This phenomenon emerges when people's lexical perception depends upon their capacities to handle the events; when their information processing registers mostly those aspects of objects or of a situation that they can properly react to and deal with according to their inherent capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trofimova|first1=IN|year=1999|title=How people of different age sex and temperament estimate the world.|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=85/2|pages=533–552|doi=10.2466/pr0.1999.85.2.533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trofimova|first1=IN|year=2012|title=Understanding misunderstanding: a study of sex differences in meaning attribution.|journal= Psychological Research|volume=77 | issue = 6 |pages=748–760|DOI=10.1007/s00426-012-0462-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trofimova|first1=IN|year=2014|title=Observer bias: an interaction of temperament traits with biases in the semantic perception of lexical material.|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9 | issue = 1 |pages=e85677.|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0085677|pmid=24475048|pmc=3903487}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For example, in these studies males with stronger motor-physical endurance estimated abstractions describing people-, work/reality- and time-related concepts in more positive terms than males with a weaker endurance. Females with stronger social or physical endurance estimated social attractors in more positive terms than weaker females. Both male and female temperament groups with higher sociability showed a universal positive bias in their estimations of neutral words, especially for social and work/reality-related concepts, in comparison to participants with lower sociability. Capacities related to the tempo of activities also appeared to impact the perception of lexical material: men with faster motor-physical tempo estimated neutral, abstract time-related concepts significantly in more positive terms than men with slower tempo.

===Memory===

A study examining [[memory]] and embodied cognition illustrates that people remember more of the gist of a story when they physically act it out.&lt;ref name="Scott et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=Christina L.|last2=Harris|first2=Richard Jackson|last3=Rothe|first3=Alicia R.|title=Embodied Cognition Through Improvisation Improves Memory for a Dramatic Monologue|journal=Discourse Processes|volume=31|issue=3|year=2001|pages=293–305|issn=0163-853X|doi=10.1207/S15326950dp31-3_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers divided female participants randomly into 5 groups, which were "Read Only," "Writing," "Collaborative Discussion," "Independent Discussion," and "[[Improvisation]]."  All participants received a [[monologue]] about teen addiction and were told to pay attention to details about the character and action in the monologue.  Participants were given 5 minutes to read the monologue twice, unaware of a future recall test.  In the "Read Only" condition participants filled out unrelated questionnaires after reading the monologue.  In the "Writing" condition participants responded to 5 questions about the story from the perspective of the character in the monologue.  They had 6 minutes to answer each question.  In the "Collaborative Discussion" condition participants responded from the character's perspective to the same questions as the "Writing" group, but in groups of 4 or 5 women.  They were also given 6 minutes per question and everyone participated in answering each question.  The "Independent Discussion" condition was the same as the "Collaborative Discussion," except 1 person answered each question.  In the "Improvisation" condition participants acted out 5 scenes from the monologue in groups of 5 women.  The researchers suggest that this condition involves embodied cognition and will produce better memory for the monologue.  Every participant played the main character and a supporting character once.  Participants were given short prompts from lines in the monologue, which were excluded from the memory test.  Participants had 2 minutes to choose characters and 4 minutes for improvisations.  The recall test was the monologue with 96 words or phrases missing.  Participants had to fill in the blanks as accurately as possible.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;

Researchers gave the recall test to a group who did not read the monologue.  They scored significantly lower than the other groups, which indicated that guessing was not easy.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;  In coding the answers to the recall test, exact words were labeled "Verbatim", and correct content but varied wording was labeled "Gist".  The combination of "Verbatim" and "Gist" was called "Total Memory."  The "Improvisational" group had more "Gist" memories than any other group and had more "Total Memory" than both of the discussion groups.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;  The results fit the researchers' hypothesis that the "Improvisational" group would remember more because they actively rehearsed the information from the monologue.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;  Although other groups had also elaborately encoded the information, the "Improvisation" group remembered significantly more than the discussion groups and marginally more than the "Reading Only" and "Writing" groups.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;  Simply experiencing the monologue in an active way aids in remembering the "Gist."&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;  There were no differences across groups for "Verbatim" memory, which they suggest could take longer than the limited time during the experiment to develop.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;

===Learning===

Ideas stemming from embodied cognition research have been applied to the field of learning. It has been shown that bodily activity can be used to enhance learning in several studies.&lt;ref name="Skulmowski &amp; Rey"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skulmowski |first1=Alexander |last2=Rey |first2=Günter Daniel |title=Embodied learning: introducing a taxonomy based on bodily engagement and task integration |journal=Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications |date=2018 |volume=3 |doi=10.1186/s41235-018-0092-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on embodied learning often utilizes educational technology in the form of virtual reality, mixed reality, or motion caputure to transform learning activities into immersive experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindgren |first1=Robb |last2=Johnson-Glenberg |first2=Mina |title=Emboldened by Embodiment |journal=Educational Researcher |date=November 2013 |volume=42 |issue=8 |pages=445–452 |doi=10.3102/0013189X13511661}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are theoretical approaches that define the level of embodiment of these learning platforms based on factors such as their capabilities for immersion and sensorimotor activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson-Glenberg |first1=Mina C. |last2=Birchfield |first2=David A. |last3=Tolentino |first3=Lisa |last4=Koziupa |first4=Tatyana |title=Collaborative embodied learning in mixed reality motion-capture environments: Two science studies. |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |date=2014 |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=86–104 |doi=10.1037/a0034008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theoretical systems analyze embodied learning in terms of the degree of bodily engagement and whether the embodiment is integrated into a learning task.&lt;ref name="Skulmowski &amp; Rey" /&gt;

==Reasoning==
A series of experiments demonstrated the interrelation between motor experience and high-level reasoning. For example, although most individuals recruit visual processes when presented with spatial problems such as mental rotation tasks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyun | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Luck | first2 = S. J. | year = 2007 | title = Visual working memory as the substrate for mental rotation | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 154–158 | doi=10.3758/bf03194043}}&lt;/ref&gt; motor experts favor motor processes to perform the same tasks, with higher overall performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D | year = 2012 | title = The role of motor processes in three-dimensional mental rotation: Shaping cognitive processing via sensorimotor experience | url = | journal = Learning and Individual Differences | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 354–359 | doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2012.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related study showed that motor experts use similar processes for the mental rotation of body parts and polygons, whereas non-experts treated these stimuli differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D | year = 2013a | title = Constraining movement alters the recruitment of motor processes in mental rotation | url = | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 224 | issue = 3| pages = 447–454 | doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3324-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results were not due to underlying confounds, as demonstrated by a training study which showed mental rotation improvements after a one-year motor training, compared with controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D. | last2 = Clerc | first2 = J. | last3 = Mansy-Dannay | first3 = A. | last4 = Guerrien | first4 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Enhancing spatial ability through sport practice: Evidence for an effect of motor training on mental rotation performance | url = | journal = Journal of Individual Differences | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 83–88 | doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar patterns were also found in working memory tasks, with the ability to remember movements being greatly disrupted by a secondary verbal task in controls and by a motor task in motor experts, suggesting the involvement of different processes to store movements depending on motor experience, namely verbal for controls and motor for experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D | year = 2013b | title = Motor expertise modulates movement processing in working memory | url = | journal = Acta Psychologica | volume = 142 | issue = 3| pages = 356–361 | doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2013.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approach and avoidance===
[[File:Van Dantzig et al. table.png|thumb|250px|Table showing response times for the positive, negative, and neutral valence conditions in the approach and avoidance experiment. Participants were significantly faster for the "positive toward" condition regardless of the central word's valence.]]
In research focused on the approach and avoidance effect, people showed an approach effect for positive words.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dantzig|first1=Saskia van|last2=Zeelenberg|first2=René|last3=Pecher|first3=Diane|title=Unconstraining theories of embodied cognition|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=45|issue=2|year=2009|pages=345–351|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the "positive toward condition," participants moved positive words toward the center of the screen and negative words away.  In the "negative toward condition," participants moved negative words toward the center and positive words away.  Participants were given feedback about their accuracy at the end of each of the 4 experimental blocks.  In the first experiment the word at the center of the screen had a positive [[valence (psychology)|valence]], while in the second experiment the central word had a negative valence.  In the third experiment, the center of the screen had an empty box.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;

As predicted, in the first experiment participants in the "positive toward condition" responded significantly faster than those in the "negative toward condition."&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;  This fits the approach/avoidance effect in embodied cognition, which states that people are faster to approach positive things and avoid negative ones.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;  In the second experiment, researchers expected participants in the "negative toward condition" to be faster, yet those in the "positive toward condition" responded significantly faster.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;  Although effects were smaller in the third experiment, participants in the "positive toward condition" were still faster.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;  Overall, people were faster in the "positive toward condition," regardless of the valence of the central word.  Despite mixed results regarding the researchers' expectations, they maintain that the motor system is important in processing higher level representations such as the action goal.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;  In this study, participants showed strong approach effects in the "positive toward condition," which supports embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;

As part of a larger study, researchers separated participants into 5 groups with different instructions.&lt;ref name="Labroo &amp; Nielsen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Labroo|first1=Aparna A.|last2=Nielsen|first2=Jesper H.|title=Half the Thrill Is in the Chase: Twisted Inferences from Embodied Cognitions and Brand Evaluation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=37|issue=1|year=2010|pages=143–158|issn=0093-5301|doi=10.1086/649908}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the "approach" condition, participants were instructed to imagine physically moving the product toward them, but in the "avoid" condition, participants had to imagine moving the product away from them.  In the "control" condition, participants were instructed to simply observe the product.  The "correction" condition involved the same instructions as the approach condition, except participants were told that the body can affect judgment.  In the "approach information" condition, participants had to list 5 reasons why they would obtain the product.  After viewing a picture of an aversive product, participants rated on a scale of 1 to 7 how desirable the product was and how much they approached of or avoided the product.  They also provided how much they would pay for the product.&lt;ref name="Labroo &amp; Nielsen" /&gt;

An approach/avoidance effect was found in relation to product evaluation.&lt;ref name="Labroo &amp; Nielsen" /&gt;  Participants in the "approach" condition liked the aversive product significantly more and would pay more for it.  There were no differences between the "avoidance," "control," "correction," and "approach information" conditions.  Simulation of approach can affect liking and willingness to pay for a product, but the effect can be reversed if the person knows about this influence.&lt;ref name="Labroo &amp; Nielsen" /&gt;  This supports embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Labroo &amp; Nielsen" /&gt;

===Self-regulation===

As part of a larger study, one experiment randomly assigned college undergraduates to 2 groups.&lt;ref name="Hung &amp; Labroo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hung|first1=Iris W.|last2=Labroo|first2=Aparna A.|title=From Firm Muscles to Firm Willpower: Understanding the Role of Embodied Cognition in Self-Regulation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=37|issue=6|year=2011|pages=1046–1064|issn=0093-5301|doi=10.1086/657240}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the "muscle-firming" condition participants grasped a pen in their hand, while in the "control" condition participants held the pen in their fingers.  The participants were then asked to fill out donations to [[Haiti]] for the [[Red Cross]] in sealed envelopes.  They were told to return the envelope regardless of whether they donated.  They also filled out questionnaires about their feelings about the Red Cross, their tendency to donate, their feelings about Haiti, what they thought the purpose of the study was, etc.&lt;ref name="Hung &amp; Labroo" /&gt;

Significantly more participants in the "muscle-firming" condition than in the "control" condition donated money.&lt;ref name="Hung &amp; Labroo" /&gt;  Condition did not affect the actual amount donated when participants chose to donate.  As the researchers predicted, the "muscle-firming" condition helped participants get over their physical aversion to viewing the devastation in Haiti and spend money.  Muscle-firming in this experiment may also be related to an increase in self-control, suggesting embodied cognition can play a role in self-regulation.&lt;ref name="Hung &amp; Labroo" /&gt;

Another set of studies was conducted by Shalev (2014), indicating that exposure to physical or conceptual thirst or dryness-related cues influence perceived energy and reduce self-regulation. In Study 1, participants primed with dryness-related concepts reported greater physical thirst and tiredness and lower subjective vitality. In Study 2, participants who were physically thirstywere less persistent in investing effort in an unsolvable anagram task. In Study 3, images of arid land influenced time preference regarding when to begin preparation to make a monetary investment. Finally, in Studies 4a and 4b, exposure to the names of dryness-related products influenced impressions of the vitality of a target person.&lt;ref name="Shalev"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shalev|first=I.|title=Implicit Energy Loss: Embodied Dryness Cues Influence Vitality and Depletion|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|year=2014|volume=24|pages=260–270|doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2013.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some suggest that the embodied mind serves self-regulatory processes by combining movement and cognition to reach a goal.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Cole"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balcetis|first1=Emily|last2=Cole|first2=Shana|author-link1=Emily Balcetis|title=Body in Mind: The Role of Embodied Cognition in Self-Regulation|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=3|issue=5|year=2009|pages=759–774|issn=1751-9004|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2009.00197.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the embodied mind has a facilitative effect.  Some judgments, such as the emotion of a face, are detected more quickly when a participant mimics the facial expression that is being evaluated.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  Individuals holding a pen in their mouths to freeze their facial muscles and make them unable to mimic the expression were less able to judge emotions.  Goal-relevant actions may be encouraged by embodied cognition, as evidenced by the automated approach and avoidance of certain environmental cues.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  Embodied cognition is also influenced by the situation.  If one moves in a way previously associated with danger, the body may require a greater level of [[information processing]] than if the body moves in a way associated with a benign situation.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Cole"/&gt;

===Social psychology===
[[File:Embodied Rapport.png|thumb|500px|Results from the social embodied cognition study that illustrate the relationship between positive emotions, observed behavioral synchrony, and embodied rapport.]]
Some social psychologists examined embodied cognition and hypothesized that embodied cognition would be supported by embodied rapport.&lt;ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk &amp; et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vacharkulksemsuk T, Fredrickson BL |title=Strangers in sync: Achieving embodied rapport through shared movements |journal=J Exp Soc Psychol |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=399–402 |year=2012 |pmid=22389521 |pmc=3290409 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.07.015 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Embodied rapport would be demonstrated by pairs of same-sex strangers using Aron’s paradigm, which instructs participants to alternate asking certain questions and to progressively self-disclose.  The researchers predicted that participants would mimic each other’s movements, reflecting embodied cognition.  Half the participants completed a control task of reading and editing a scientific article, while half the participants completed a shortened version of Aron’s [[self-disclosure]] paradigm.&lt;ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk &amp; et al" /&gt;

There is a significant correlation between self-disclosure and positive emotions towards the other participant.&lt;ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk &amp; et al" /&gt;  Participants randomly assigned to the self-disclosure task displayed more [[behavioral synchrony]] (rated by independent judges watching the tapes of each condition on mute) and reported more positive emotions than the control group.&lt;ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk &amp; et al" /&gt;  Since bodily movements influence the psychological experience of the task, the relationship between self-disclosure and positive feelings towards one's partner may be an example of embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk &amp; et al" /&gt;

===Evolutionary view ===

Embodied cognition may also be defined from the perspective of [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]].&lt;ref name="Kaschak et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaschak|first1=Michael P.|last2=Maner|first2=Jon K.|last3=Miller|first3=Saul|last4=Coyle|first4=Jacqueline M.|title=Embodied social cognition: Bodies, emotions, and blackberries|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=39|issue=7|year=2009|pages=1255–1256|issn=0046-2772|doi=10.1002/ejsp.692}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Evolutionary psychologists view emotion as an important [[Homeostasis|self-regulatory]] aspect of embodied cognition, and [[Motivated reasoning|emotion as a motivator]] towards [[Goal setting|goal-relevant action]].&lt;ref name="Kaschak et al" /&gt; Emotion helps drive [[adaptive behavior]].  The evolutionary perspective cites language, both spoken and written, as types of embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Kaschak et al" /&gt;  [[Diction|Pacing]] and [[non-verbal communication]] reflect embodied cognition in spoken language.  Technical aspects of written language, such as [[italics]], [[all caps]], and [[emoticons]] promote an [[Internal monologue|inner voice]] and thereby a sense of feeling rather than thinking about a written message.&lt;ref name="Kaschak et al"/&gt;

== Cognitive science and linguistics ==
[[George Lakoff]] and his collaborators have developed several lines of evidence that suggest that people use their understanding of familiar physical objects, actions and situations (such as containers, spaces, trajectories) to understand other more complex domains (such as mathematics, relationships or death). Lakoff argues that ''all'' cognition is based on knowledge that comes from the body and that other domains are mapped onto our embodied knowledge using a combination of [[conceptual metaphor]], [[image schema]] and [[prototype theory|prototypes]].

=== Conceptual metaphor ===
{{Main|Conceptual metaphor}}
Lakoff and [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Mark Johnson]]{{sfn|Lakoff|Johnson|1980}} showed that humans use metaphor ubiquitously and that metaphors operate at a conceptual level (i.e., they map one conceptual domain onto another), they involve an unlimited number of individual expressions and that the same metaphor is used conventionally throughout a culture.
Lakoff and his collaborators have collected thousands of examples of conceptual metaphors in many domains.{{sfn|Lakoff|Johnson|1980}}{{sfn|Lakoff|Turner|1989}}

For example, people will typically use language about journeys to discuss the history and status of a love affair, a metaphor Lakoff and Johnson call "LOVE IS A JOURNEY". It is used in such expression as: "we arrived at a crossroads," "we parted ways", "we hit the rocks" (as in a sea journey), "she's in the driver's seat", or, simply, "we're together". In cases like these, something complex (a love affair) is described in terms of something that can be done with a body (travel through space).

=== Image schema ===
{{Main|Image schema}}
{{expand section|date=December 2011}}

=== Prototypes ===
{{Main|Prototype theory}}
Prototypes are "typical" members of a category, e.g. a robin is a prototypical bird, but a penguin is not. The role of prototypes in human cognition was first identified and studied by [[Eleanor Rosch]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last=Rosch | first=Eleanor | authorlink=Eleanor Rosch

| ref=harv | volume=4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was able to show that prototypical objects are more easily categorized than non-prototypical objects, and that people answered questions about a category as a whole by reasoning about a prototype. She also identified [[prototype theory#Basic level categories|basic level categories]]:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; categories that have prototypes that are easily visualized (such as a chair) and are associated with basic physical motions (such as "sitting"). Prototypes of basic level categories are used to reason about more general categories.

Prototype theory has been used to explain human performance on many different cognitive tasks and in a large variety of domains. George Lakoff argues that prototype theory shows that the categories that people use are based on our experience of having a body and have no resemblance to logical [[class (philosophy)|classes]] or [[type-token distinction|types]]. For Lakoff, this shows that traditional [[objectivity (philosophy)#Objectivism|objectivist]] accounts of [[truth]] cannot be correct.&lt;ref&gt;''Lakoff, G. [[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things|Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind]]. '' University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-46804-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic argument against embodiment in its strict form is based on abstract meaning. Whereas the meanings of the words ‘eye’ and ‘grasp’ can be explained, to a degree, by pointing to objects and actions, those of ‘beauty’ and ‘freedom’ cannot.&lt;ref&gt;

| pmid=23932069
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that some common sensorimotor knowledge is immanent in ''freeing'' actions or instantiations of ''beauty'', but it seems likely that additional semantic binding principles are behind such concepts. So might it be necessary, after all, to place abstract semantics in an amodal meaning system? A remarkable observation has recently been offered that may be of the essence in this context: abstract terms show an over-proportionally strong tendency to be semantically linked to knowledge about emotions.&lt;ref name="meteyard"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This additional embodied–semantic link accounts for advantages in processing speed for abstract emotional terms over otherwise matched control words.&lt;ref name="kousta" /&gt; In addition, abstract words strongly activate anterior cingulate cortex, a site known to be relevant for emotion processing&lt;ref name="vigliocco"&gt;
{{cite journal

|display-authors=etal}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it appears that at least some abstract words are semantically grounded in emotion knowledge.

If abstract emotion words indeed receive their meaning through grounding in emotion it is of crucial relevance&lt;ref name="wittgenstein"&gt;
{{cite book
|author=Wittgenstein, L. 
|title=Philosophical Investigations. 
|year = 1953

|year = 2009
|title = Wittgenstein: Understanding and Meaning, Part 1: Essays. Wiley-Blackwell}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the link between an abstract emotion word and its abstract concept is via manifestation of the latter in prototypical actions. The child learns an abstract emotion word such as 'joy' because it shows JOY-expressing action schemas, which language-teaching adults use as criteria for correct application of the abstract emotion word&lt;ref name="vigliocco" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "wittgenstein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bookWitt" /&gt; Thus, the manifestation of emotions in actions becomes the crucial link between word use and internal state, and hence between sign and meaning. Only after a stock of abstract emotion words has been grounded in emotion-expressing action can further emotion terms be learnt from context.

== Artificial intelligence and robotics ==

=== History of artificial intelligence ===

The experience of AI research provides another line of evidence supporting the embodied mind thesis. In the early history of [[artificial intelligence|AI]] successes in programming high-level reasoning tasks such as chess-playing led to an unfounded optimism that all AI problems would be relatively quickly solved. These programs simulated intelligence using logic and high-level abstract symbols (an approach called [[Good old-fashioned AI]]). This "disembodied" approach ran into serious difficulties in the 1970s and 80s, as researchers discovered that abstract, disembodied reasoning was highly inefficient and could not achieve human-levels of competence on many simple tasks.&lt;ref&gt;See {{slink|History of AI|The problems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding agencies (such as [[DARPA]]) withdrew funding because the field of AI had failed to achieve its stated objectives, leading to difficult period now known as the "[[AI winter]]". Many AI researchers began to doubt that high level symbolic reasoning could ever perform well enough to solve simple problems.

[[Rodney Brooks]] argued in the mid-80s that these symbolic approaches were failing because researchers did not appreciate the importance of sensorimotor skills to intelligence in general, and applied these principals to robotics (an approach he called "[[Nouvelle AI]]"). Another successful new direction was [[neural network]]s—programs based on the actual structures within human bodies that gave rise to intelligence and learning. In the 90s, [[Artificial intelligence#Statistical|statistical AI]] achieved high levels of success in industry without using any symbolic reasoning, but instead using probabilistic techniques to make "guesses" and improve them incrementally. This process is similar to the way human beings are able to make fast, intuitive choices without stopping to reason symbolically.

=== Moravec's paradox ===
{{Main|Moravec's paradox}}

Moravec's paradox is the discovery by [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]] researchers that, contrary to traditional assumptions, high-level [[reasoning]] requires very little computation, but low-level [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] skills require enormous computational resources. The principle was articulated by [[Hans Moravec]] (whence the name) and others in the 1980s.
As [[Hans Moravec|Moravec]] writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Encoded in the large, highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the human brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world and how to survive in it. The deliberate process we call reasoning is, I believe, the thinnest veneer of human thought, effective only because it is supported by this much older and much powerful, though usually unconscious, sensorimotor knowledge. We are all prodigious olympians in perceptual and motor areas, so good that we make the difficult look easy. Abstract thought, though, is a new trick, perhaps less than 100 thousand years old. We have not yet mastered it. It is not all that intrinsically difficult; it just seems so when we do it.{{sfn|Moravec|1988|pp=15–16}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Approach to artificial intelligence ===

==== Solving problems of perception and locomotion directly ====
{{See also|Nouvelle AI|Situated|Behavior based AI|Embodied cognitive science}}
Many [[artificial intelligence]] researchers have argued that a machine may need a human-like body to think and speak as well as a human being. As early as 1950, [[Alan Turing]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can
buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. That process could follow the normal teaching of a
child. Things would be pointed out and named, etc.  (Turing, 1950).{{sfn|Turing 1950}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Embodiment theory was brought into artificial intelligence most notably by [[Rodney Brooks]] who showed in the 1980s that [[robot]]s could be more effective if they 'thought' ([[automated planning|planned]] or [[Information processing|processed]]) and [[perception|perceived]] as little as possible.  The robot's intelligence is geared towards only handling the minimal amount of information necessary to make its [[behavior]] be appropriate and/or as desired by its creator.

Others have argued that without taking into account both the architecture of the human brain, and embodiment, it is unrealistic to replicate accurately the processes which take place during language acquisition, comprehension, production, or during non-linguistic actions.&lt;ref name="Paradowski2012"&gt;Paradowski, Michał B. 2012. [https://www.academia.edu/2400943/Developing_Embodied_Multisensory_Dialogue_Agents Developing embodied multisensory dialogue agents]. In: Rzepka, Rafał, Michał Ptaszyński &amp; Paweł Dybala (Eds.) Linguistic and Cognitive Approaches to Dialogue Agents. Birmingham: The Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour, 6–14.&lt;/ref&gt; There have thus been suggestions that while robots are far from isomorphic with humans, they could benefit from strengthened associative connections in the optimization of their processes and their reactivity and sensitivity to environmental stimuli, and in situated human-machine interaction, and that the concept of multisensory integration be extended to cover linguistic input and the complementary information combined from temporally coincident sensory impressions.&lt;ref name="Paradowski2012"/&gt;

The embodied approach to AI has been given several names by different schools of researchers, including: [[Nouvelle AI]] (Brooks' term), [[Situated]] AI, [[Behavior based AI]] and [[Embodied cognitive science]].

==Neuroscience==
{{Cleanup rewrite|comprehensive|2=section|date=December 2011}}

One source of inspiration for embodiment theory has been research in [[cognitive neuroscience]], such as the proposals of [[Gerald Edelman]] concerning how mathematical and computational models such as [[neuronal group selection]] and neural degeneracy result in emergent categorization.

Rohrer (2005) discusses how both our neural and developmental embodiment shape both our mental and linguistic categorizations. The degree of thought abstraction has been found to be associated with physical distance which then affects associated ideas and perception of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liberman N, Trope Y |date=2008-11-21|title= The Psychology of Transcending the Here and Now|journal= Science|volume= 322|pages= 1201–1205| doi=10.1126/science.1161958|pmid=19023074|issue = 5905|pmc = 2643344|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The embodied mind thesis is compatible with some views of cognition promoted in [[neuropsychology]], such as the theories of consciousness of [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]], [[Gerald Edelman]], and [[Antonio Damasio]].

The modeling work of cognitive neuroscientists such as [[Francisco Varela]] and [[Walter Jackson Freeman III|Walter Freeman]] seeks to explain embodied and situated cognition in terms of [[dynamical systems]] theory and [[neurophenomenology]], but rejects the idea that the brain uses representations to do so (a position also espoused by [[Gerhard Werner]]).

==Criticisms==

Research on embodied cognition is extremely broad, covering a wide range of concepts.  Methods to study embodied cognition vary from experiment to experiment based on the [[operational definition]] used by researchers.  There is much evidence for embodied cognition, although interpretation of results and their significance may be disputed.  Researchers continue to search for the best way to study and interpret embodied cognition.

===Infants as examples===

Some&lt;ref name=Longo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Longo|first=M. R.|title=What's embodied and how can we tell?|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=39|pages=1207–1209|doi=10.1002/ejsp.684|issue=7|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticize the notion that pre-verbal children provide an ideal channel for studying embodied cognition, especially embodied [[social cognition]].&lt;ref name="Daum et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daum|first1=Moritz M.|last2=Sommerville|first2=Jessica A.|last3=Prinz|first3=Wolfgang|title=Disentangling embodied and symbolic modes of social understanding|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=39|issue=7|year=2009|pages=1214–1216|issn=0046-2772|doi=10.1002/ejsp.686}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It may be impossible to know when a pre-verbal infant is a "pure model" of embodied cognition, since infants experience dramatic changes in social behavior throughout development.&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt;  A 9-month old has reached a different developmental stage than a 2-month old.  Looking-time and reaching measures of embodied cognition may not represent embodied cognition since infants develop [[object permanence]] of objects they can see before they develop object permanence with objects they can touch.&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt;  True embodied cognition suggests that children would have to first physically engage with an object to understand object permanence.&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt;

The response to this critique is that infants are "ideal models" of embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Daum et al"/&gt;  Infants are the best models because they utilize symbols less than adults do.&lt;ref name="Daum et al" /&gt;  Looking-time could likely be a better measure of embodied cognition than reaching because infants have not developed certain [[fine motor skills]] yet.&lt;ref name="Daum et al" /&gt;  Infants may first develop a passive mode of embodied cognition before they develop the active mode involving fine motor movements.&lt;ref name="Daum et al"/&gt;

===Overinterpretation?===

Some criticize the conclusions made by researchers about embodied cognition.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=F.|title=Embodied cognition|journal=Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences|year=2010|volume=9|pages=619–628|doi=10.1007/s11097-010-9175-x|issue=4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pencil-in-teeth study is frequently cited as an example of these invalidly drawn conclusions.  The researchers believed that the quicker responses to positive sentences by participants engaging their smiling muscles represented embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Glenberg et al." /&gt;  However, opponents argue that the effects of this exercise were primed or facilitated by the engagement of certain facial muscles.&lt;ref name=Adams /&gt;  Many cases of facilitative movements of the body may be incorrectly labeled as evidence of embodied cognition.&lt;ref name=Adams /&gt;

== Six views of embodied cognition ==

# '''"Cognition is situated'''. Cognitive activity takes place in the context of a real-world environment, and inherently involves perception and action." One example of this is moving around a room while, at the same time, trying to decide where the furniture should go.
# '''"Cognition is time-pressured'''. We are 'mind on the hoof' (Clark, 1997), and cognition must be understood in terms of how it functions under the pressure of real-time interaction with the environment." When you're under pressure to make a decision, the choice that is made emerges from the confluence of pressures that you're under.  In the absence of pressure, a decision may be made differently. 
# '''"We off-load cognitive work onto the environment'''. Because of limits on our information-processing abilities (e.g., limits on attention and working memory), we exploit the environment to reduce the cognitive workload. We make the environment hold or even manipulate information for us, and we harvest that information only on a need-to-know basis." This is seen when people have calendars, agendas, PDAs, or anything to help them with everyday functions. We write things down so we can use the information when we need it, instead of taking the time to memorize or encode it into our minds.
# '''"The environment is part of the cognitive system'''. The information flow between mind and world is so dense and continuous that, for scientists studying the nature of cognitive activity, the mind alone is not a meaningful unit of analysis." This statement means that the production of cognitive activity does not come from the mind alone, but rather is a mixture of the mind and the environmental situation that we are in. These interactions become part of our cognitive systems. Our thinking, decision-making, and future are all impacted by our environmental situations.
# '''"Cognition is for action'''. The function of the mind is to guide action and things such as perception and memory must be understood in terms of their contribution to situation-appropriate behavior." This claim has to do with the purpose of perception and cognition. For example, visual information is processed to extract identity, location, and affordances (ways that we might interact with objects).  A prominent anatomical distinction is drawn between the "what" (ventral) and "where" (dorsal) pathways in visual processing.  However, the commonly labeled "where" pathway is also the "how" pathway, at least partially dedicated to action.   
# '''"Off-line cognition is body-based'''. Even when decoupled from the environment, the activity of the mind is grounded in mechanisms that evolved for interaction with the environment – that is, mechanisms of sensory processing and motor control." This is shown with infants or toddlers best. Children utilize skills and abilities they were born with, such as sucking, grasping, and listening, to learn more about the environment. The skills are broken down into five main categories that combine sensory with motor skills, sensorimotor functions. The five main skills are:
## [[Mental image|Mental Imagery]]: Is visualizing something that is not currently present in your environment.  For example, imagining a future activity, or recalling how many windows are on the first floor of a house you once lived in (even though you did not count them explicitly while living there).  
## [[Working Memory]]: Short term memory
## [[Episodic memory|Episodic Memory]]: Long term memory of specific events.  
## [[Implicit memory|Implicit Memory]]: means by which we learn certain skills until they become automatic for us. An example of this would be an adult brushing his/her teeth, or an expert race car driver putting the car in drive.
## Reasoning and Problem-Solving: Having a mental model of something will increase problem-solving approaches.

===Criticism of the six claims===
Margaret Wilson adds: "Some authors go so far as to complain that the phrase 'situated cognition' implies, falsely, that there also exists cognition that is not situated (Greeno &amp; Moore, 1993, p. 50)."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2002: 627).&lt;/ref&gt; Of her six claims, she notes in her abstract, "the first three and the fifth claim appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability. The fourth claim, I argue, is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2002: 625).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entertainment''' is a form of activity that holds the attention and [[Interest (emotion)|interest]] of an [[audience]], or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (Oxford University Press, 1971, Vol 1 pp.&amp;nbsp;213–14) gives Latin and French origins for the word, including ''inter'' (among) + ''tenir'' (to hold) as derivations, giving translations of "to hold mutually" or "to hold intertwined" and "to engage, keep occupied, the [[attention]] thoughts or time (of a person)". It also provides words like "merry-making", "pleasure", "delight", as well as "to receive as a guest and show hospitality to". It cites a 1490 usage by [[William Caxton]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. [[Storytelling]], [[music]], [[drama]], [[dance]], and different kinds of [[performance]] exist in all cultures, were supported in [[Court (royal)|royal courts]], developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an [[entertainment industry]] that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a [[banquet]] adapted for two; to any size or type of [[party]], with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.

The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with [[amusement]], so that one common understanding of the idea is [[fun]] and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of [[ceremony]], celebration, [[religious festival]], or [[satire]] for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving [[insight]] or intellectual growth.

An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private [[recreation]] or [[leisure]] activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[opera]], [[television show]], or [[film]]; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of [[game]]s, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of [[theatre]] or [[concert]]s; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of [[List of traditional children's games|children's games]]. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]]. Films and [[video game]]s, for example, although they use newer media, continue to [[storytelling|tell stories]], present drama, and play music. [[Festival]]s devoted to [[music festival|music]], [[Film festival|film]], or [[Competitive dance|dance]] allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.

Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as [[fencing]] or [[archery]], once necessary skills for some, have become serious [[sport]]s and even [[professional|professions]] for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as [[cooking]], have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.

The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative [[remix]]. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.

== Psychology and philosophy ==
Entertainment can be distinguished from other activities such as [[education]] and [[marketing]] even though they have learned how to use the appeal of entertainment to achieve their different goals. The importance and impact of entertainment is recognised by scholars&lt;ref&gt;For example, the application of psychological models and theories to entertainment is discussed in Part III of {{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Jennings|title=Psychology of Entertainment|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-5238-7|pages=367–434|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sayre&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFSayreKing2010|last=Sayre|first=Shay|title=Entertainment and Society: Influences, Impacts, and Innovations (Google eBook)|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-415-99806-9|edition=2nd|author2=King, Cynthia}} p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and its increasing sophistication has influenced practices in other fields such as [[museology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation, Education, Entertainment?|year=2011|publisher=Channel View Publication|isbn=978-1-84541-164-0|editor=Frost, Warwick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Revolutions|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-203-93264-1|authors=Macleod, Suzanne; Watson, Sheila|editor=Knell, Simon J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists say the function of media entertainment is "the attainment of [[gratification]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zillmann|first=Dolf|title=Media Entertainment –  the psychology of its appeal|year=2000|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. Taylor &amp; Francis e-library (2009)|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-3324-2|page=vii|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; No other results or measurable benefit are usually expected from it (except perhaps the final score in a sporting entertainment). This is in contrast to education (which is designed with the purpose of developing understanding or helping people to learn) and marketing (which aims to encourage people to purchase commercial products). However, the distinctions become blurred when education seeks to be more "entertaining" and entertainment or marketing seek to be more "educational". Such mixtures are often known by the [[neologism]]s "[[edutainment]]" or "[[infotainment]]". The psychology of entertainment as well as of learning has been applied to all these fields.&lt;ref&gt;For example, marketers mix commercial messages with non-commercial messages in entertainments on radio, television, films, videos and games. {{cite book|last=Shrum|first=L.J.J.|title=The Psychology of Entertainment Media|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-84872-944-5|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some education-entertainment is a serious attempt to combine the best features of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Entertainment-Education and Social Change: History, Research, and Practice|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=1-4106-0959-6|editors=Singhal, Arvind; Cody, Michael J.; Rogers, Everett; Sabido, Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Games and Learning |year=2011 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location=London; New York |isbn=978-1-4411-9870-9 |editor1-last=de Freitas |editor1-first=Sara |editor2-last=Maharg |editor2-first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people are entertained by others' pain or the idea of their unhappiness ([[schadenfreude]]).

An entertainment might go beyond gratification and produce some insight in its audience.  Entertainment may skillfully consider universal philosophical questions such as: "What is the meaning of life?"; "What does it mean to be human?"; "What is the right thing to do?"; or "How do I know what I know?". Questions such as these drive many narratives and dramas, whether they are presented in the form of a story, film, play, poem, book, dance, comic, or game. Dramatic examples include [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s influential play ''[[Hamlet]]'', whose hero articulates these concerns in [[poetry]]; and films, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', which explores the nature of knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Irwin|editor-first=William|title=The Matrix and Philosophy|year=2002|publisher=Carus Publishing Company|location=Peru, Illinois|page=196|isbn=0-8126-9502-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released world-wide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ql_9 IMDb ''The Matrix'' worldwide release dates]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novel]]s give great scope for investigating these themes while they entertain their readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Peter|title=Philosophy and the Novel|year=1975|location=Oxford, Clarendon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a creative work that considers philosophical questions so entertainingly that it has been presented in a very wide range of forms is ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. Originally a [[radio comedy]], this story became so popular that it has also appeared as a novel, film, television series, stage show, comic, [[audiobook]], [[LP record]], [[adventure game]] and [[online game]], its ideas became popular references (see [[Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]) and has been translated into many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpson, M.J. |title=The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide |edition=2nd |publisher=Pocket Essentials |year=2005 |isbn=1-904048-46-3 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its themes encompass the [[meaning of life]], as well as "the [[ethics]] of entertainment, [[artificial intelligence]], multiple worlds, God, and [[philosophical method]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Joll|editor-first=Nicholas|title=Philosophy and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire; New York|isbn=978-0-230-29112-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ancient craft of communicating events and experiences, using words, images, sounds and gestures" by telling a story&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gakhar|first=Sonia|title=The influence of storytelling on pre-service students' attitudes and intentions (MSc Thesis)|year=2007|publisher=Iowa State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not only the means by which people passed on their cultural values and traditions and history from one generation to another, it has been an important part of most forms of entertainment ever since the earliest times. Stories are still told in the early forms, for example, around a fire while [[camping]], or when listening to the stories of another culture as a [[tourist]]. "The earliest storytelling sequences we possess, now of course, committed to writing, were undoubtedly originally a speaking from mouth to ear and their force as entertainment derived from the very same elements we today enjoy in films and novels."&lt;ref name=Kuhns&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhns|first=Richard Francis|title=Decameron and the Philosophy of Storytelling: Author as Midwife and Pimp|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York; Chichester West Sussex|isbn=0-231-13608-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storytelling is an activity that has evolved and developed "toward variety".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Many entertainments, including storytelling but especially music and drama, remain familiar but have developed into a wide variety of form to suit a very wide range of personal preferences and cultural expression. Many types are blended or supported by other forms. For example, drama, stories and banqueting (or dining) are commonly enhanced by music; sport and [[game]]s are incorporated into other activities to increase appeal. Some may have evolved from serious or necessary activities (such as [[running]] and [[jumping]]) into competition and then become entertainment. It is said, for example, that [[pole vault]]ing "may have originated in the Netherlands, where people used long poles to vault over wide canals rather than wear out their clogs walking miles to the nearest bridge. Others maintain that pole vaulting was used in warfare to vault over fortress walls during battle."&lt;ref name=Carlsen&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlsen|first=Spike|title=A Splintered History of Wood|year=2009|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-137356-5|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment for such sports has become increasingly sophisticated. Vaulting poles, for example, were originally made from woods such as [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[hickory]] or [[hazel]];  in the 19th century [[bamboo]] was used and in the 21st century poles can be made of [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre]].&lt;ref name=Carlsen/&gt; Other activities, such as [[Stilts|walking on stilts]], are still seen in [[circus]] performances in the 21st century. [[Gladiator|Gladiatorial combats]], also known as "gladiatorial games", popular during Roman times, provide a good example of an activity that is a combination of sport, punishment, and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Gladiators: violence and spectacle in ancient Rome|author = Dunkle, Roger| year= 2008| location = Harlow, England; New York| publisher = Pearson/Longman| isbn = 9781405807395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Medieval Sport: Quest for Survival | author1=Wiseman, Douglas C. | year=1977  | publisher=Distributed by ERIC Clearinghouse Microfiche }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to what is regarded as entertainment can occur in response to cultural or historical shifts. Hunting wild animals, for example, was introduced into the [[Roman Empire]] from [[Carthage]] and became a popular public entertainment and spectacle, supporting an international trade in wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Potter|first=David Stone|title=Life, Death, and Entertainment in the Roman Empire|year=1999|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-10924-3|page=308|author2=Mattingly, David J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entertainment also evolved into different forms and expressions as a result of social upheavals such as wars and revolutions. During the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]], for example, [[Revolutionary opera]] was sanctioned by the Communist party and [[World War I]], the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Russian revolution]] all affected entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roshwald|first=Aviel|title=European Culture in the Great War: The Arts, Entertainment and Propaganda, 1914–1918|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-57015-8|author2=Stites, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heinrich|first=Anselm|title=Heinrich, Entertainment, propaganda, education: regional theatre in Germany and Britain between 1918 and 1945|year=2007|publisher=University of Hertfordshire Press|location=Hatfield, England|isbn=978-1-902806-74-7|editor=Meech, Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arthur|first=Max|title=When this bloody war is over: soldiers' songs from the First World War|year=2001|publisher=Piatkus|location=London|isbn=0-7499-2252-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Horn, Dave Laing, Paul Oliver, Peter Wicke, Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society,"&gt;{{cite book|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society|year=2003|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-6321-5|authors=Laing, Dave; Oliver, Paul; Wicke, Peter|editor=Horn, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McReynolds|first=Louise|title=Russia at Play: Leisure Activities at the End of the Tsarist Era|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University|isbn=0-8014-4027-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively minor changes to the form and venue of an entertainment continue to come and go as they are affected by the period, fashion, culture, technology, and economics. For example, a story told in dramatic form can be presented in an open-air theatre, a [[music hall]], a [[Movie theater|movie theatre]], a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]], or as technological possibilities advanced, via a personal electronic device such as a [[tablet computer]]. Entertainment is provided for mass audiences in purpose-built structures such as a [[Theater (structure)|theatre]], [[auditorium]], or [[stadium]]. One of the most famous venues in the Western world, the [[Colosseum]], "dedicated [[Before common era|AD]]&amp;nbsp;80 with a hundred days of games, held fifty thousand spectators," and in it audiences "enjoyed "blood sport with the trappings of stage shows".{{sfnp|ref=harv|McDonald Walton|2007|p=51}} [[Spectacle]]s, competitions, [[Racing|races]], and sports were once presented in this purpose-built arena as public entertainment. New stadia continue to be built to suit the ever more sophisticated requirements of global audiences.

=== Court entertainment ===

[[File:Ralph Hedley The tournament 1898.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ralph Hedley]] ''The Tournament'' (1898) Children adapting a courtly entertainment]]
Imperial and royal courts have provided training grounds and support for professional entertainers, with different cultures using palaces, castles and forts in different ways. In the [[Maya civilization|Maya city states]], for example, "spectacles often took place in large plazas in front of palaces; the crowds gathered either there or in designated places from which they could watch at a distance."&lt;ref name=Walthall&gt;{{cite book|title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-520-25443-5|editor=Walthall, Anne|ref=CITEREFWalthall2008}} pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Court entertainments also crossed cultures. For example, the [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] was introduced to India by the [[Mughal emperors|Mughals]], and passed onto the [[British Empire]], which then followed Indian tradition: "institutions, titles, customs, ceremonies by which a [[Maharaja]] or [[Nawab]] were installed&amp;nbsp;... the exchange of official presents&amp;nbsp;... the order of precedence", for example, were "all inherited from&amp;nbsp;... the Emperors of Delhi".&lt;ref name="Indian Princes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Charles|authorlink = Charles Allen (writer)|last2 = Dwivedi|first2=Sharada|authorlink2 = Sharada Dwivedi|title=Lives of the Indian Princes|year=1984|publisher=Century Publishing|location=London|isbn=0-7126-0910-5|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea, the "court entertainment dance" was "originally performed in the palace for entertainment at court banquets."&lt;ref name="Van Zile"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Van Zile|first=Judy|title=Perspectives on Korean Dance|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, Connecticut|isbn=0-8195-6494-X}} p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Court entertainment often moved from being associated with the court to more general use among [[commoner]]s. This was the case with "masked dance-dramas" in Korea, which "originated in conjunction with village [[Shamanism|shaman]] rituals and eventually became largely an entertainment form for commoners".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=9}} [[Nautch]] dancers in the Mughal Empire performed in Indian courts and palaces. Another evolution, similar to that from courtly entertainment to common practice, was the transition from religious ritual to secular entertainment, such as happened during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty with the Narye festival. Originally "solely religious or ritualistic, a secular component was added at the conclusion".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=69}} Former courtly entertainments, such as [[jousting]], often also survived in children's games.

In some courts, such as those during the [[Byzantine Empire]], the genders were segregated among the upper classes, so that "at least before the period of the [[Komnenos|Komnenoi]]" (1081–1185) men were separated from women at ceremonies where there was entertainment such as receptions and banquets.&lt;ref name=Garland&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Lynda|title=Byzantine Women: Varieties of Experience 800–1200|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Aldershot, Hampshire|isbn=978-0-7546-5737-8|pages=177–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Court ceremonies, palace banquets and the spectacles associated with them, have been used not only to entertain but also to demonstrate wealth and power. Such events reinforce the relationship between ruler and ruled; between those with power and those without, serving to "dramatise the differences between ordinary families and that of the ruler".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}} This is the case as much as for traditional courts as it is for contemporary ceremonials, such as the [[Hong Kong handover ceremony]] in 1997, at which an array of entertainments (including a banquet, a parade, fireworks, a festival performance and an art spectacle) were put to the service of highlighting a change in political power. Court entertainments were typically performed for royalty and courtiers as well as "for the pleasure of local and visiting dignitaries".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} Royal courts, such as the Korean one, also supported traditional dances.{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} In Sudan, musical instruments such as the so-called "slit" or "talking" drums, once "part of the court orchestra of a powerful chief", had multiple purposes: they were used to make music; "speak" at ceremonies; mark community events; send long-distance messages; and call men to hunt or war.&lt;ref name="Slit Drum"&gt;{{cite web|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=Episode 94: Sudanese Slit Drum (Transcript)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode94/|work=History of the World in 100 Objects|publisher=BBC Radio 4/British Museum|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGregor&gt;{{cite book|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=A History of the World in 100 objects|year=2010|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=978-1-84614-413-4|pages=613–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/FMgugdskR7eaWj_ST2fAeQ British Museum catalogue image of Sudanese slit drum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtly entertainments also demonstrate the complex relationship between entertainer and spectator: individuals may be either an entertainer or part of the audience, or they may swap roles even during the course of one entertainment. In the court at the [[Palace of Versailles]], "thousands of courtiers, including men and women who inhabited its apartments, acted as both performers and spectators in daily rituals that reinforced the status hierarchy".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}}

Like court entertainment, royal occasions such as coronations and weddings provided opportunities to entertain both the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and the people. For example, the splendid 1595 [[Accession Day]] celebrations of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] offered [[tournament]]s and jousting and other events performed "not only before the assembled court, in all their finery, but also before thousands of Londoners eager for a good day's entertainment. Entry for the day's events at the [[Tiltyard]] in [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] was set at [[History of the English penny (1485–1603)#Elizabeth I|12d]]".&lt;ref name=Bevington&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-59436-7|author=Holbrook, Peter|editor=Bevington, David|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public punishment ===
[[File:Ticket for the execution of Jonathan Wild.jpg|thumb|160px|Ticket for the execution of [[Jonathan Wild]] (1725)]]
Although most forms of entertainment have evolved and continued over time, some once-popular forms are no longer as acceptable.  For example, during earlier centuries in Europe, watching or participating in the punishment of criminals or social outcasts was an accepted and popular form of entertainment. Many forms of [[public humiliation]] also offered local entertainment in the past. Even capital punishment such as [[hanging]] and [[Decapitation|beheading]], offered to the public as a warning, were also regarded partly as entertainment. Capital punishments that lasted longer, such as [[stoning]] and [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawing and quartering]], afforded a greater public spectacle. "A hanging was a carnival that diverted not merely the unemployed but the unemployable. Good bourgeois or curious aristocrats who could afford it watched it from a carriage or rented a room."&lt;ref name=Gay/&gt; Public punishment as entertainment lasted until the 19th century by which time "the awesome event of a public hanging aroused the[ir] loathing of writers and philosophers".&lt;ref name=Gay&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Peter Gay|last=Gay|first=Peter|title=Schnitzler's Century – The making of middle-class culture 1815–1914|year=2002|publisher=W.W.

Children's entertainment is centred on [[Play (activity)|play]] and is significant for their growth. Entertainment is also provided to children or taught to them by adults and many activities that appeal to them such as [[puppet]]s, [[clown]]s, [[pantomime]]s and [[cartoon]]s are also enjoyed by adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=John|title=Harlequin Britain: Pantomime and Entertainment, 1690–1760|year=2004|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7910-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geipel|first=John|title=The cartoon: a short history of graphic comedy and satire|year=1972|publisher=Newton Abbot: David &amp; Charles|isbn=0-7153-5328-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children have always played games. It is accepted that as well as being entertaining, playing games helps children's development. One of the most famous visual accounts of children's games is a painting by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] called ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'', painted in 1560. It depicts children playing a range of games that presumably were typical of the time. Many of these games, such as [[Marble (toy)|marbles]], [[hide-and-seek]], blowing [[soap bubble]]s and [[Piggy-back (transportation)|piggyback riding]] continue to be played.

Most forms of entertainment can be or are modified to suit children's needs and interests. During the 20th century, starting with the often criticised but nonetheless important work of [[G. Stanley Hall]], who "promoted the link between the study of development and the 'new' laboratory psychology",&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Thompson |first1=Dennis |last2=Hogan |first2=John D. |last3=Clark |first3=Philip M. |title=Developmental Psychology in Historical Perspective |year=2012 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts; Oxford |isbn=978-1-4051-6747-5 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and especially with the work of [[Jean Piaget]], who "saw cognitive development as being analogous to biological development",{{sfnp|Thompson|2012|p=114}} it became understood that the [[Developmental psychology|psychological development]] of children occurs in stages and that their capacities differ from adults. Hence, stories and activities, whether in books, film, or video games were developed specifically for child audiences. Countries have responded to the special needs of children and the rise of digital entertainment by developing systems such as [[television content rating systems]], to guide the public and the [[entertainment industry]].

In the 21st century, as with adult products, much entertainment is available for children on the internet for private use. This constitutes a significant change from earlier times. The amount of time expended by children indoors on screen-based entertainment and the "remarkable collapse of children's engagement with nature" has drawn criticism for its negative effects on [[imagination]], adult [[cognition]] and [[Subjective well-being|psychological well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cobb|first=Edith|title=The ecology of imagination in childhood|year=1977|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-03870-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Louv|first=Richard|title=[[Last Child in the Woods]]: saving our children from nature-deficit disorder|year= 2005|publisher=Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina|isbn=1-56512-391-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature"&gt;{{cite news|last=Monbiot|first=George|title=If children lose contact with nature they won't fight for it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms ==

=== Banquets ===
[[Banquet]]s have been a venue for entertainment since ancient times, continuing until the 21st century, when they are still being used for many of their original purposes{{snd}} to impress visitors, especially important ones ('''4''', '''6''', '''9'''); to show hospitality ('''2''', '''4''', '''8'''); as an occasion to showcase supporting entertainments such as music or dancing, or both ('''2''', '''3'''). They were an integral part of court entertainments ('''3''', '''4''') and helped entertainers develop their skills ('''2''', '''3'''). They are also important components of celebrations such as coronations ('''9'''), weddings ('''7'''), [[birthday]]s ('''10''') civic or political achievements ('''5'''), military engagements or victories ('''6''') as well as religious obligations ('''1'''). In modern times, banquets are commercially available, for example, in restaurants ('''10''') and combined with a performance in [[dinner theater|dinner theatres]]. Cooking by professional [[chef]]s has also become a form of entertainment as part of global competitions such as the [[Bocuse d'Or]].

=== Music ===
{{Main article|Music}}
[[File:A full house, seen from the rear of the stage, at the Metropolitan Opera House for a concert by pianist Josef Hofmann, 1 - NARA - 541890.tif|thumb|left|A full house at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City, waiting for a musical entertainment to begin (1937)]]
Music is a supporting component of many kinds of entertainment and most kinds of performance. For example, it is used to enhance storytelling, it is indispensable in dance ('''1''', '''4''') and opera, and is usually incorporated into dramatic film or theatre productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Paul|title=A concise history of western music|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-84294-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music is also a universal and popular type of entertainment on its own, constituting an entire performance such as when [[concert]]s are given ('''2''', '''4''', '''5''', '''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9''' ). Depending on the [[rhythm]], [[Musical instrument|instrument]], performance and style, music is divided into many genres, such as [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[Folk music|folk]], ('''4''', '''5''', '''8'''), [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music]] ('''6''', '''9''') or traditional ('''1''', '''3'''). Since the 20th century, performed music, once available only to those who could pay for the performers, has been available cheaply to individuals by the entertainment industry, which broadcasts it or pre-records it for sale.

The wide variety of musical performances, whether or not they are artificially [[Amplifier|amplified]] ('''6''', '''7''', '''9''', '''10'''), all provide entertainment irrespective of whether the performance is from [[Solo (music)|soloists]] ('''6'''), [[Choir|choral]] ('''2''') or [[orchestra|orchestral groups]] ('''5''', '''8'''), or [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] ('''3'''). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation ('''5''', '''8'''). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate ('''7''', '''9'''). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately ('''10''').

The instruments used in musical entertainment are either solely the [[human voice]] ('''2''', '''6''') or solely instrumental ('''1''', '''3''') or some combination of the two ('''4''', '''5''', '''7''', '''8'''). Whether the performance is given by [[Singing|vocalists]] or [[Musician|instrumentalists]], the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual ('''10'''), passing by ('''3'''), small ('''1''', '''2''') or large ('''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9'''). Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably [[a cappella]] and [[overtone singing]], are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing ('''7''').

=== Games ===
{{Main article|Game}}
Games are played for entertainment—sometimes purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a [[World Chess Championship|chess championship]]. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.

Equipment varies with the game. [[Board game]]s, such as [[Go (game)|Go]], ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' or [[backgammon]] need a board and markers. One of the oldest known board games is [[Senet]], a game played in Ancient Egypt, enjoyed by the [[pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Botermans|first=Jack|title=The Book of Games: Strategy, Tactics &amp; History|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Pub Co Inc|isbn=1-4027-4221-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Card game]]s, such as [[whist]], [[poker]] and [[Contract bridge|Bridge]] have long been played as evening entertainment among friends. For these games, all that is needed is a deck of [[playing card]]s. Other games, such as [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]], played with numerous strangers, have been organised to involve the participation of non-players via [[gambling]]. Many are [[children's game|geared for children]], and can be played outdoors, including [[hopscotch]], [[hide and seek]], or [[Blind man's bluff (game)|Blind man's bluff]]. The [[list of ball games]] is quite extensive. It includes, for example, [[croquet]], [[lawn bowling]] and [[paintball]] as well as many sports using various forms of [[ball]]s. The options cater to a wide range of skill and fitness levels. Physical games can develop agility and competence in [[motor skill]]s. Number games such as [[Sudoku]] and puzzle games like the [[Rubik's cube]] can develop mental prowess.

[[History of video games|Video games]] are played using a controller to create results on a screen. They can also be played online with participants joining in remotely. In the second half of the 20th century and in the 21st century the number of such games increased enormously, providing a wide variety of entertainment to players around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Digital Games|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London; California; New Delhi|isbn=1-4129-0033-6|author=Bryce, Jo|editor=Rutter, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=James|title=Videogames|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London; New York|isbn=0-203-64290-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video games are popular in [[East Asia]]n countries such as South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Dal Yong|title=Korea's Online Gaming Empire|year=2010|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=978-0-262-01476-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French poet [[Louise Labé]] (1520/1522–1566) wrote "a profound and timeless insight into reading's innate power".

''The past gives us pleasure and is of more service than the present; but the delight of what we once felt is dimly lost never to return and its memory is as distressing as the events themselves were then delectable&amp;nbsp;... But when we happen to put our thoughts in writing, how easily, later on, does our mind race through an infinity of events, incessantly alive, so that a long time afterwards when we take up those written pages we can return to the same place and to the same disposition in which we once found ourselves.'' &lt;br&gt;quote from and commentary by Fischer (2003)&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Steven Roger|title=A history of reading|year=2003|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=1-86189-160-1|ref=harv|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Saint [[Teresa of Ávila]] (1515–1582) read chivalrous novels and wrote about the "rapture" that books provided.

''I became accustomed to reading [novels] and that small fault made me cool my desire and will to do other tasks. I thought nothing of spending many hours a day and night in this vain exercise, hidden from my father. My rapture in this was so great, that unless I had a new book to read, it seemed to me that I could not be happy.'' &lt;br&gt; quoted in Fischer (2003){{sfnp|Fischer|2003|pp=234–35}}
}}

[[Reading (process)|Reading]] has been a source of entertainment for a very long time, especially when other forms, such as performance entertainments, were (or are) either unavailable or too costly. Even when the primary purpose of the writing is to inform or instruct, reading is well known for its capacity to distract from everyday worries. Both stories and information have been passed on through the tradition of [[orality]] and oral traditions survive in the form of [[performance poetry]] for example. However, they have drastically declined. "Once literacy had arrived in strength, there was no return to the oral prerogative."{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=215}} The advent of printing, the reduction in costs of books and an increasing literacy all served to enhance the mass appeal of reading. Furthermore, as [[font]]s were standardised and texts became clearer, "reading ceased being a painful process of decipherment and became an act of pure pleasure".{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=212}} By the 16th century in Europe, the appeal of reading for entertainment was well established.

Among [[literature]]'s many genres are some designed, in whole or in part, purely for entertainment. [[Limerick (poetry)|Limericks]], for example, use verse in a strict, predictable rhyme and rhythm to create humour and to amuse an audience of listeners or readers. Interactive books such as "[[choose your own adventure]]" can make literary entertainment more participatory.

[[File:Goscinny (scenarist van de strips Asterix en Lucky Luke) (l) en Morris (tekenaar, Bestanddeelnr 924-5894.jpg|thumb|Readers entertained by comic books (1971)]]
[[Comics]] and cartoons are literary genres that use drawings or graphics, usually in combination with text, to convey an entertaining narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=James|title=British comics: a cultural history|year=2011|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-86189-855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary comics have elements of [[fantasy]] and are produced by companies that are part of the [[entertainment industry]]. Others have unique authors who offer a more personal, philosophical view of the world and the problems people face. Comics about [[superheroes]] such as [[Superman]] are of the first type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Mike|title=Superhero comics of the Golden Age: the illustrated history|year= 1992|publisher=Taylor Publishing|location=Dallas, Texas|isbn=0-87833-808-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the second sort include the individual work over 50 years  of [[Charles M. Schulz]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/charles-m-schulz-on-cartooning/ "Charles M. Schulz on Cartooning", ''Hogan's Alley'' #1, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; who produced a popular comic called ''[[Peanuts]]''&lt;ref&gt;Films have been made of the ''Peanuts'' cartoons, including one [[The Peanuts Movie|released in 2015]] to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the comic strip.&lt;/ref&gt; about the relationships among a cast of child characters;&lt;ref&gt;The philosophical and theological implications of Schulz's work were explored in: {{cite book|last=Short|first=Robert L.|title=The Gospel According to Peanuts|year=1965|publisher=John Knox Press|location=Westminster|isbn=0-664-22222-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Leunig]] who entertains by producing whimsical cartoons that also incorporate [[social criticism]]. The Japanese [[Manga]] style differs from the western approach in that it encompasses a wide range of genres and themes for a readership of all ages. [[Caricature]] uses a kind of graphic entertainment for purposes ranging from merely putting a smile on the viewer's face, to raising social awareness, to highlighting the moral characteristics of a person being caricatured.

=== Comedy ===
{{Main article|Comedy}}
[[File:Dictator charlie3.jpg|thumb|Comedian [[Charlie Chaplin]] impersonating [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] for comic effect in the [[satire|satirical]] film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940)]]
[[Comedy]] is both a [[genre]] of entertainment and a component of it, providing laughter and amusement, whether the comedy is the sole purpose or used as a form of contrast in an otherwise serious piece. It is a valued contributor to many forms of entertainment, including in literature, theatre, opera, film and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roston|first=Murray|title=The comic mode in English literature: from the Middle Ages to today|year=2011|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9588-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grindon|first=Leger|title=The Hollywood romantic comedy: conventions, history, controversies|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-4051-8266-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In royal courts, such as in the Byzantine court, and presumably, also in its wealthy households, "[[Mime artist|mimes]] were the focus of orchestrated humour, expected or obliged to make fun of all at court, not even excepting the emperor and members of the imperial family. This highly structured role of [[jester]] consisted of verbal humour, including [[teasing]], jests, [[insult]], ridicule, and [[obscenity]] and [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] humour such as [[slapstick]] and horseplay in the presence of an audience."&lt;ref name=Garland/&gt; In medieval times, all comic types{{snd}} the [[buffoon]], jester, [[hunchback]], [[Dwarfism|dwarf]], jokester, were all "considered to be essentially of one comic type: the fool", who while not necessarily funny, represented "the shortcomings of the individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hokenson|first=Jan Walsh|title=The Idea of Comedy: History, Theory, Critique|year=2006|publisher=Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp|location=Cranbury, New Jersey|isbn=0-8386-4096-6|pages=150–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hornback|first=Robert|title=The English clown tradition from the middle ages to Shakespeare|year=2009|publisher=D.S.

Shakespeare wrote seventeen [[Shakespearean comedy|comedies]] that incorporate many techniques still used by performers and writers of comedy—such as [[joke]]s, [[pun]]s, [[parody]], [[wit]], [[observational humor]], or the unexpected effect of [[irony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Penny|title=The Cambridge introduction to Shakespeare's comedies|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=978-0-521-85668-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=David|title=Shakespeare's practical jokes: an introduction to the comic in his work|year=2007|publisher=Bucknell University Press|location=Lewisburg, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-8387-5680-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[One-liner joke]]s and satire are also used to comedic effect in literature. In [[farce]], the comedy is a primary purpose.

The meaning of the word "comedy" and the audience's expectations of it have changed over time and vary according to culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorpe|first=Ashley|title=The role of the chou ("clown") in traditional Chinese drama: comedy, criticism, and cosmology on the Chinese stage|year=2007|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston, New York|isbn=0-7734-5303-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple physical comedy such as [[slapstick]] is entertaining to a broad range of people of all ages. However, as cultures become more sophisticated, national nuances appear in the style and references so that what is amusing in one culture may be unintelligible in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Comedy: A Geographic and Historical Guide|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-32706-8&lt;!-- (set)--&gt;|editor=Charney, Maurice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance ===
{{Main|Performance}}
Live performances before an audience constitute a major form of entertainment, especially before the invention of audio and video recording. Performance takes a wide range of forms, including theatre, music and drama. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European royal courts presented [[masque]]s that were complex theatrical entertainments involving dancing, singing and acting. Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular. It also encompass all three forms, demanding a high level of musical and dramatic skill, collaboration and like the masque, production expertise as well.

[[File:Aida poster colors fixed.jpg|center|thumb|550px|Poster for a 1908 production of [[Verdi]]'s 1871 opera ''[[Aida]]'', performed by the Hippodrome Opera Company of Cleveland, Ohio]]
Audiences generally show their appreciation of an entertaining performance with applause. However, all performers run the risk of failing to hold their audience's attention and thus, failing to entertain. Audience dissatisfaction is often brutally honest and direct.

{{Quotation|"Of course you all ought to know that while singing a good song or, or giving a good recitation&amp;nbsp;... helps to arrest the company's attention&amp;nbsp;... Such at least was the case with me{{snd}} the [[publican]] devised a plan to bring my entertainment to an end abruptly, and the plan was, he told the waiter to throw a wet towel at me, which, of course, the waiter did&amp;nbsp;... and I received the wet towel, full force, in the face, which staggered me&amp;nbsp;... and had the desired effect of putting an end to me giving any more entertainments in the house."

==== Storytelling ====
{{Main|Storytelling}}
Storytelling is an ancient form of entertainment that has influenced almost all other forms. It is "not only entertainment, it is also thinking through human conflicts and contradictions".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Hence, although stories may be delivered directly to a small listening audience, they are also presented as entertainment and used as a component of any piece that relies on a narrative, such as film, drama, ballet, and opera. Written stories have been enhanced by illustrations, often to a very high artistic standard, for example, on [[illuminated manuscript]]s and on ancient scrolls such as Japanese ones.&lt;ref name=Watanabe&gt;{{cite book|last=Watanabe|first=Masako|title=Storytelling in Japanese Art|year=2011|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=978-0-300-17590-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories remain a common way of entertaining a group that is on a journey. Showing how stories are used to pass the time and entertain an audience of travellers, [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] used [[pilgrim]]s in his literary work ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the 14th century, as did Wu Cheng'en in the 16th century in ''[[Journey to the West]]''. Even though journeys can now be completed much faster, stories are still told to passengers en route in cars and aeroplanes either orally or delivered by some form of technology.

The power of stories to entertain is evident in one of the most famous ones—[[Scheherazade]]—a story in the [[Iran|Persian]] professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yamanaka|first=Yuriko|title=The Arabian nights and orientalism: perspectives from East &amp; West|year=2006|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London; New York|author2=Nishio, Tetsuo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Sir Richard (1821–1890) (in English)|title=Arabian nights. A plain and literal translation of the Arabian nights' entertainments: now entitled The book of the thousand and one nights |year=1958|publisher=Barker|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arabian nights in English literature : studies in the reception of The thousand and one nights into British culture|year=1988|publisher=Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|isbn=0-333-36693-X|editor=Caracciolo, Peter L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Shéhérazade (Ravel)|Ravel]] and [[Karol Szymanowski|Szymanowski]] have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini|Pasolini]] made a [[Arabian Nights (1974 film)|film adaptation]]; and there is an [[The Magic of Scheherazade|innovative video game]] based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of [[wayang]], in which the performance is accompanied by a [[gamelan]] orchestra or the similarly traditional [[Punch and Judy]] show.

Epic narratives, poems, [[saga]]s and [[allegory|allegories]] from all cultures tell such gripping tales that they have inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment. Examples include the Hindu ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''; [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]''; the first Arabic novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]''; the Persian epic ''[[Shahnameh]]''; the [[Sagas of Icelanders]] and the celebrated ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of the Genji]]''. Collections of stories, such as ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' or those by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], have been similarly influential. Originally published in the early 19th century, this collection of folk stories significantly influence modern popular culture, which subsequently used its themes, images, symbols, and structural elements to create new entertainment forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rankin|first=Walter|title=Grimm pictures: fairy tale archetypes in eight horror and suspense films|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3174-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most powerful and long-lasting stories are the foundation stories, also called [[myth of origin|origin]] or [[creation myth]]s such as the [[Dreamtime]] myths of the [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian aborigines]], the Mesopotamian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The epic of Gilgamesh: the Babylonian epic poem and other texts in Akkadian and Sumerian (English –  translated from Akkadian and Sumerian by Andrew George)|year=1999|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=0-7139-9196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Hawaiian stories of the origin of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Vivian Laubach|title=Hawaiian Myths of Earth, Sea, and Sky|year=1966|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-1171-2|author2=Kahalewai, Marilyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; These too are developed into books, films, music and games in a way that increases their longevity and enhances their entertainment value.

[[Theatre]] performances, typically dramatic or musical, are presented on a stage for an audience and have a history that goes back to [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic times]] when "leading musicians and actors" performed widely at "poetical competitions", for example at "[[Delphi]], [[Delos]], [[Ephesus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|title=The Cambridge companion to Greek and Roman theatre|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-83456-2|editors=McDonald, Marianne and Walton, J. Michael}} p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] and his teacher [[Plato]] both wrote on the theory and purpose of theatre. Aristotle posed questions such as "What is the function of the arts in shaping character? Should a member of the ruling class merely watch performances or be a participant and perform? What kind of entertainment should be provided for those who do not belong to the elite?"{{sfnp|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|McDonald &amp; Walton|2007|p=93}} The "Ptolemys in Egypt, the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] in [[Pergamon|Pergamum]]" also had a strong theatrical tradition and later, wealthy patrons in Rome staged "far more lavish productions".{{sfnp|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|McDonald &amp; Walton|2007|p=26}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of British Theatre|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press (3 volumes)|isbn=0-521-82790-6|editors=Milling, Jane; Donohue, Joseph W.; Thomson, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expectations about the performance and their engagement with it have changed over time ('''1''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenrick|first=John|title=Musical theatre: a history|year=2008|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=0-8264-2860-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in England during the 18th century, "the prejudice against actresses had faded"&lt;ref name=Ackroyd&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ackroyd|first=Peter|title=London: The Biography|year=2000|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=0-385-49771-7}} p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Europe generally, going to the theatre, once a socially dubious activity, became "a more respectable middle-class pastime"&lt;ref name=Frame&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Frame|first=Murray|title=The St. Petersburg Imperial Theaters: Stage and State in Revolutionary Russia, 1900–1920|year=2000|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co, Inc.

The stage and the spaces set out in front of it for an audience create a theatre. All types of stage are used with all types of seating for the audience, including the impromptu or improvised ('''2''', '''3''', '''6'''); the temporary ('''2'''); the elaborate ('''9'''); or the traditional and permanent ('''5''', '''7'''). They are erected indoors ('''3''', '''5''', '''9''') or outdoors ('''2''', '''4''', '''6'''). The skill of managing, organising and preparing the stage for a performance is known as [[stagecraft]] ('''10'''). The audience's experience of the entertainment is affected by their expectations, the stagecraft, the type of stage, and the type and standard of seating provided.

==== Cinema and film ====
{{Main|Film}}
[[File:Munken kino (kinolerret).jpg|thumb|left|Film audiences are typically seated in comfortable chairs arranged in close rows before a projection screen. Norway (2005)]]

[[Film]]s are a major form of entertainment, although not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose: [[documentary film]], for example, aims to create a record or inform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wyver|first=John|title=The Moving Image: An International History of Film, Television, and Video|year=1989|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Limited|isbn=0-631-16821-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the two purposes often work together. The medium was a global business from the beginning: "The [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] were the first to send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public."&lt;ref name=Paris&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFParis1999|title=The First World War and popular Cinema|year=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0-8135-2824-0|editor=Paris, Michael}} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, [[Pathé]] launched and distributed [[Pathé News|newsreels]]&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; and by [[World War I]], films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment. "In the first decade of the [20th] century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and newsfilms."&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; The Americans first "contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images," but "the French were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle".{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=115}} Film therefore became a part of the entertainment industry from its early days. Increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and entertain audiences. [[Animation]], for example, which involves the display of rapid movement in an art work, is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cavalier|first=Stephen|title=The world history of animation|year= 2011|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-26112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) in the 21st century made it "possible to do spectacle" more cheaply and "on a scale never dreamed of" by [[Cecil B. DeMille]].&lt;ref name=Byrnes&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|title=Pompeii, Noah and Exodus: The sword giveth again|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/pompeii-noah-and-exodus-the-sword-giveth-again-20140327-35jm4.html|work=Film|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1930s to 1950s, movies and radio were the "only mass entertainment" but by the second decade of the 21st century, technological changes, economic decisions, risk aversion and globalisation reduced both the quality and range of films being produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Losing the plot|last = Byrnes|first = Paul|date = 12 December 2015|work = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = |via = |pages = 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sophisticated [[visual effects]] and CGI techniques, for example, rather than humans, were used not only to create realistic images of people, landscapes and events (both real and [[Fantasy|fantastic]]) but also to animate non-living items such as [[Lego]] normally used as entertainment as a game in physical form.&lt;ref name=Maddox&gt;{{cite web|last=Maddox|first=Garry|title=The Lego Movie: Hit off the old block | url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-lego-movie-hit-off-the-old-block-20140327-35jek.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creators of ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' "wanted the audience to believe they were looking at actual Lego bricks on a tabletop that were shot with a real camera, not what we actually did, which was create vast environments with digital bricks inside the computer."&lt;ref name=Maddox/&gt; The convergence of computers and film has allowed entertainment to be presented in a new way and the technology has also allowed for those with the personal resources to screen films in a [[home cinema|home theatre]], recreating in a private venue the quality and experience of a public theatre. This is similar to the way that the nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or the use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries.

Films also re-imagine entertainment from other forms, turning stories, books and plays, for example, into new entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothwell|first=Kenneth S.|title=A History of Shakespeare on Screen: A Century of Film and Television|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-59404-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Story of Film: An Odyssey|The Story of Film]]'', a documentary about the [[history of film]], gives a survey of global achievements and innovations in the medium, as well as changes in the conception of film-making. It demonstrates that while some films, particularly those in the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] tradition that combines "realism and [[melodrama]]tic romanticism",{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=17}} are intended as a form of [[escapism]], others require a deeper engagement or more thoughtful response from their audiences. For example, the award winning Senegalese film ''[[Xala]]'' takes government corruption as its theme. [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' was a brave and innovative parody, also on a political theme. Stories that are thousands of years old, such as [[Noah (2014 film)|''Noah'']], have been re-interpreted in film, applying familiar [[literary devices]] such as allegory and [[personification]] with new techniques such as CGI to explore big themes such as "human folly", good and evil, courage and despair, love, faith, and death{{snd}} themes that have been a main-stay of entertainment across all its forms.&lt;ref name=Byrnes2&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|title=Noah review: Moments of brilliance but can't shake sinking feeling  |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/noah-review-moments-of-brilliance-but-cant-shake-sinking-feeling-20140327-35jm3.html|work=Review|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other media, excellence and achievement in films is recognised through a range of awards, including ones from the  American [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], the [[Cannes International Film Festival]] in France and the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]].

==== Dance ====
{{Main|Dance}}
[[File:Peterborough Snow Ball 2008 silent video.ogg|left|thumb|Dancers creating their own entertainment at a ball. &lt;br&gt; Peterborough (2008) (silent video)]]
The many forms of [[dance]] provide entertainment for all age groups and cultures. Dance can be serious in tone, such as when it is used to express a culture's history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the service of comedy. Since it combines many forms of entertainment{{snd}} music, movement, storytelling, theatre{{snd}} it provides a good example of the various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.

Dance is "a form of cultural representation" that involves not just dancers, but "[[Choreography (dance)|choreographers]], audience members, [[Patronage|patrons]] and [[impresario]]s&amp;nbsp;... coming from all over the globe and from vastly varied time periods."&lt;ref name="Dils"&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFDilsAlbright2001|title=Moving History/Dancing Cultures: A Dance History Reader|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina|isbn=0-8195-6412-5|author=Albright, Ann Cooper|editor=Dils, Ann}} p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether from Africa, Asia or Europe, dance is constantly negotiating the realms of political, social, spiritual and artistic influence."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} Even though dance traditions may be limited to one cultural group, they all develop. For example, in Africa, there are "[[Dahomey|Dahomean]] dances, [[Hausa people|Hausa]] dances, [[Maasai people|Masai]] dances and so forth."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=34}} [[Ballet]] is an example of a highly developed Western form of dance that moved to the theatres from the French court during the time of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the dancers becoming professional theatrical performers.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Clarke|first=Mary|title=The history of dance|year=1981|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-517-54282-X}} p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Some dances, such as the [[quadrille]], a square dance that "emerged during the [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic years]] in France"{{sfnp|Clarke|1981|p=97}} and other [[country dance]]s&lt;ref name="Wilson2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=An Analysis of Country Dancing|date=1808|publisher=W. Calvert}}&lt;/ref&gt; were once popular at social gatherings like [[Ball (dance)|balls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fullerton|first=Susannah|title=A Dance with [[Jane Austen]]: How a Novelist and Her Characters Went to the Ball|year=2012|publisher=Pgw|isbn=0-7112-3245-8|author2=Le Faye, Deirdre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=The Treasures of Terpsichore: or, A Companion for the Ball-Room|date=1816|publisher=Sherwood, Neely and Jones|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now rarely performed. On the other hand, many [[folk dance]]s (such as [[Scottish highland dance|Scottish Highland dancing]] and [[Irish dance|Irish dancing]]), have evolved into competitions, which by adding to their audiences, has increased their entertainment value. "Irish dance theatre, which sometimes features traditional Irish steps and music, has developed into a major dance form with an international reputation."&lt;ref name="Wulff"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wulff|first=Helena|title=Dancing at the Crossroads: Memory and Mobility in Ireland|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-328-2|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since dance is often "associated with the female body and women's experiences",{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} female dancers, who dance to entertain, have in some cases been regarded as distinct from "decent" women because they "use their bodies to make a living instead of hiding them as much as possible".{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=142}} Society's attitudes to female dancers depend on the culture, its history and the entertainment industry itself. For example, while some cultures regard any dancing by women as "the most shameful form of entertainment",&lt;ref&gt;van Nieuwkerk, Karin. "Changing Images and Shifting Identities: Female Performers in Egypt" in Dils &amp; Albright (2001). p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; other cultures have established venues such as [[strip clubs]] where deliberately erotic or sexually provocative dances such as [[striptease]] are performed in public by professional women dancers for mostly male audiences.

Various political regimes have sought to control or ban dancing or specific types of dancing, sometimes because of disapproval of the music or clothes associated with it. Nationalism, authoritarianism and racism have played a part in banning dances or dancing. For example, during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime, American dances such as [[Swing (dance)|swing]], regarded as "completely un-German", had "become a public offense and needed to be banned".&lt;ref name="Karina"&gt;{{cite book|last=Karina|first=Lilian|title=Hitler's Dancers: German Modern Dance and the Third Reich|year=1999|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=1-57181-300-4|page=174|edition=English language|others=Translated by Jonathan Steinberg|author2=Kant, Marion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Shanghai, China, in the 1930s, "dancing and nightclubs had come to symbolise the excess that plagued Chinese society" and officials wondered if "other forms of entertainment such as [[brothel]]s" should also be banned. Banning had the effect of making "the dance craze" even greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Field |first=Andrew David |title=Shanghai's Dancing World: Cabaret Culture and Urban Politics, 1919–1954 |year=2010 |publisher=The Chinese University of Hong Kong |location=Sha Tin, Hong Kong |isbn=978-962-996-373-6 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, the Public Dance Hall Act of 1935 "banned{{snd}} but did not stop{{snd}} dancing at the crossroads and other popular dance forms such as house and [[barn dance]]s."&lt;ref name="Wulff" /&gt; In the US, various dances were once banned, either because like [[burlesque]], they were suggestive,&lt;ref name="Butters"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butters|first=Gerald R.|title=Banned in Kansas: Motion Picture Censorship, 1915–1966|year=2007|publisher=University of Missouri Press|location=Columbia|isbn=978-0-8262-1749-3|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because, like the [[Twist (dance)|Twist]], they were associated with [[African American]]s.&lt;ref name="Pruter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pruter|first=Robert|title=Chicago Soul|year=1991|publisher=University of Illinois|isbn=0-252-06259-0|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; "African American dancers were typically banned from performing in [[minstrel show]]s until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]."&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Constance Valis|title=Tap Dancing America: A Cultural History|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-539082-7|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dances can be performed [[Solo (dance)|solo]] ('''1''', '''4'''); in pairs, ('''2''', '''3'''); in groups, ('''5''', '''6''', '''7'''); or by massed performers ('''10'''). They might be improvised ('''4''', '''8''') or highly choreographed ('''1''', '''2''', '''5''', '''10'''); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, ('''4'''); a paying audience ('''2'''); a world audience ('''10'''); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre ('''3''', '''5'''). They might be a part of a celebration, such as a [[wedding]] or [[New Year]] ('''6''', '''8'''); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by [[warrior]]s like a [[haka]] ('''7'''). Some dances, such as traditional dance in '''1''' and ballet in '''2''', need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the [[can-can]], require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves ('''9''').

==== Animals ====
Animals have been used for the purposes of entertainment for millennia. They have been hunted for entertainment (as opposed to hunted for food); displayed while they hunt for prey; watched when they compete with each other; and watched while they perform a trained routine for human amusement. The Romans, for example, were entertained both by competitions involving wild animals and acts performed by trained animals. They watched as "lions and bears danced to the music of pipes and [[cymbal]]s; horses were trained to kneel, bow, dance and prance&amp;nbsp;... acrobats turning handsprings over wild lions and vaulting over wild leopards." There were "violent confrontations with wild beasts" and "performances over time became more brutal and bloodier".&lt;ref name="St Leon"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=St Leon|first=Mark|title=Circus: the Australian story|year=2011|publisher=Melbourne Books|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-1-877096-50-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals that perform trained routines or "acts" for human entertainment include fleas in [[flea circus]]es, dolphins in [[Dolphinarium|dolphinaria]], and monkeys doing tricks for an audience on behalf of the player of a [[street organ]]. Animals kept in [[zoo]]s in ancient times were often kept there for later use in the arena as entertainment or for their entertainment value as exotica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hancocks|first=David|title=A different nature: the paradoxical world of zoos and their uncertain future|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-23676-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contests between animals are now regarded as sports{{snd}} for example, [[horse racing]] is regarded as both a sport and an important source of entertainment. Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In Australia, the horse race run on [[Melbourne Cup]] Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual event. Like horse racing, [[camel racing]] requires human riders, while [[greyhound racing]] does not. People find it entertaining to watch animals race competitively, whether they are trained, like horses, camels or dogs, or untrained, like [[Cockroach racing|cockroaches]].

The use of animals for entertainment is often controversial, especially the hunting of wild animals. Some contests between animals, once popular entertainment for the public, have become illegal because of the cruelty involved. Among these are [[blood sport]]s such as [[bear-baiting]], [[dog fighting]] and [[cockfighting]]. Other contests involving animals remain controversial and have both supporters and detractors. For example, the conflict between opponents of pigeon shooting who view it as "a cruel and moronic exercise in marksmanship, and proponents, who view it as entertainment" has been tested in a court of law.&lt;ref name=Bronner&gt;An extensive discussion of the legal and cultural issues can be found in {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bronner|first=Simon J.|title=Killing Tradition: Inside Hunting and Animal Rights Controversies|year=2008|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2528-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox hunting]], which involves the use of horses as well as hounds, and [[bullfighting]], which has a strong theatrical component, are two entertainments that have a long and significant cultural history.

==== Circus ====
{{Main|Circus}}
[[File:Cirque Soleil Stilt 1.jpg|thumb|Children entertained by a [[stilts|stilt]] walker performing in a circus act]]

A [[circus]], described as "one of the most brazen of entertainment forms",&lt;ref name=Stoddart&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoddart|first=Helen|title=Rings of Desire: Circus History and Representation|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK &amp; New York|page=13|isbn=0-7190-5233-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a special type of theatrical performance, involving a variety of physical skills such as [[acrobatics]] and [[juggling]] and sometimes performing animals. Usually thought of as a travelling show performed in a [[wikt:big top|big top]], circus was first performed in permanent venues. [[Philip Astley]] is regarded as the founder of the modern circus in the second half of the 18th century and [[Jules Léotard]] is the French performer credited with developing the art of the [[trapeze]], considered synonymous with circuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Michael|title=Victorian sensation, or, The spectacular, the shocking, and the scandalous in nineteenth-century Britain|year=2003|publisher=Anthem Press|location=London|isbn=1-84331-076-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astley brought together performances that were generally familiar in traditional British fairs "at least since the beginning of the 17th century": "tumbling, rope-dancing, juggling, animal tricks and so on".&lt;ref name=Stoddart/&gt; It has been claimed that "there is no direct link between the Roman circus and the circus of modern times.&amp;nbsp;... Between the demise of the Roman 'circus' and the foundation of Astley's Amphitheatre in London some 1300 years later, the nearest thing to a circus ring was the rough circle formed by the curious onlookers who gathered around the itinerant tumbler or juggler on a [[village green]]."{{sfnp|St Leon|2011}}

==== Magic ====
{{Main|Magic (illusion)}}
The form of entertainment known as [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] or conjuring and recognisable as performance, is based on traditions and texts of magical rites and dogmas that have been a part of most cultural traditions since ancient times. (References to magic, for example, can be found in the [[Bible]], in [[Hermeticism]], in [[Zoroastrianism]], in the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition, in [[mysticism]] and in the sources of [[Freemasonry]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lévi|first=Éliphas|title=The History of Magic ''(originally published in 1860 as'' Histoire de la Magie ''English edition, translated by A.E. Waite in 1913)''|year=2001|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=0-87728-929-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage magic is performed for an audience in a variety of media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and [[showmanship (performing)|showmanship]] is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, [[psychological manipulation]], sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the [[stunt performer|stunt performances]] and [[Escapology|escape acts]] of [[Harry Houdini]], for example, regarded him as a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Houdini: the man who walked through walls  | author1=Gresham, William Lindsay  | year=1959  | publisher=Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=The Great Houdini: magician extraordinary  | author1=Epstein, Beryl| author2=Epstein, Sam  | year=1971  | location = Folkestone| publisher=Bailey Brothers and Swinfen (Reprint.

[[Magician (fantasy)|Fantasy magicians]] have held an important place in literature for centuries, offering entertainment to millions of readers. Famous wizards such as [[Merlin]] in the [[Arthurian legends]] have been written about since the 5th and 6th centuries, while in the 21st century, the young wizard [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] became a global entertainment phenomenon when the book series about him sold about 450 million copies (as at June 2011), making it the [[List of book series|best-selling book series in history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rowling 'makes £5 every second'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7649962.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=3 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Potter series to be sold as e-books|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13889578|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Street performance ====
[[File:Didgeridoo street player.jpg|thumb|[[Didgeridoo]] player entertaining passers by in the street]]

Street entertainment, [[street performance]] or "busking" are forms of performance that have been meeting the public's need for entertainment for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=David|title=The buskers: a history of street entertainment|year= 1981|publisher=David &amp; Charles|location=Newton Abbot; North Pomfret, Vermont|isbn=0-7153-8026-5|author2=Greenwood, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "an integral aspect of London's life", for example, when the city in the early 19th century was "filled with spectacle and diversion".{{sfnp|Ackroyd|2000|p=346 (caption to plate following text pages)}} [[Minstrel]]s or [[troubadour]]s are part of the tradition. The art and practice of busking is still celebrated at annual busking festivals.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.coffsharbourbuskers.com/ 2012 Coffs Harbour International Buskers and Comedy Festival].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three basic forms of contemporary street performance. The first form is the "circle show". It tends to gather a crowd, usually has a distinct beginning and end, and is done in conjunction with [[street theatre]], [[puppeteer]]ing, [[magician (illusion)|magicians]], [[comedian]]s, acrobats, [[juggler]]s and sometimes [[musician]]s. This type has the potential to be the most lucrative for the performer because there are likely to be more donations from larger audiences if they are entertained by the act. Good buskers control the crowd so patrons do not obstruct foot traffic. The second form, the ''walk-by act'', has no distinct beginning or end. Typically, the busker provides an entertaining ambience, often with an unusual instrument, and the audience may not stop to watch or form a crowd. Sometimes a walk-by act spontaneously turns into a circle show. The third form, ''café busking'', is performed mostly in restaurants, pubs, bars and cafés. This type of act occasionally uses [[public transport]] as a venue.

==== Parades ====
{{Main|Parade}}
[[Parade]]s are held for a range of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are designed to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. [[Cavalcade]]s and the modern variant, the [[motorcade]], are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the [[Trooping the Colour]] in '''8''') and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.

One of the earliest forms of parade were "[[Roman triumph|triumphs]]"{{snd}} grand and sensational displays of foreign treasures and spoils, given by triumphant Roman generals to celebrate their victories. They presented conquered peoples and nations that exalted the prestige of the victor. "In the summer of 46&amp;nbsp;[[Before common era|BCE]] [[Julius Caesar]] chose to celebrate four triumphs held on different days extending for about one month."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurval|first=Robert Alan|title=Actium and Augustus: The Politics and Emotions of Civil War|year=1995|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=0-472-10590-6|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe from the Middle Ages to the [[Baroque]] the [[Royal Entry]] celebrated the formal visit of the monarch to the city with a parade through elaborately decorated streets, passing various shows and displays. The annual [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in London is an example of a civic parade that has survived since medieval times.

Many religious festivals (especially those that incorporate [[processions]], such as [[Holy Week procession]]s or the Indian festival of [[Holi]]) have some entertainment appeal in addition to their serious purpose. Sometimes, religious rituals have been adapted or evolved into secular entertainments, or like the [[Festa del Redentore]] in Venice, have managed to grow in popularity while holding both secular and sacred purposes in balance. However, [[pilgrimage]]s, such as the Christian pilgrimage of the [[Way of St. James]], the Muslim [[Hajj]] and the Hindu [[Kumbh Mela]], which may appear to the outsider as an entertaining parade or procession, are not intended as entertainment: they are instead about an individual's spiritual journey. Hence, the relationship between spectator and participant, unlike entertainments proper, is different. The manner in which the Kumbh Mela, for example, "is divorced from its cultural context and repackaged for Western consumption{{snd}} renders the presence of [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]] deeply problematic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maclean|first=Kama|title=Pilgrimage and Power: The Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, 1765–1954|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533894-2|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parades generally impress and delight often by including unusual, colourful costumes ('''7, 10'''). Sometimes they also commemorate ('''5''', '''8''') or celebrate ('''1''', '''4, 6,''' '''8''', '''9'''). Sometimes they have a serious purpose, such as when the context is military ('''1''', '''2''', '''5'''), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or have a role to play ('''6''', '''7, 10'''). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away ('''9'''), it is likely to have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.

==== Fireworks ====
{{Main|Fireworks}}
[[File:Medellín-Juegos pirotécnicos bicentenario-11.jpg|thumb|Spectators at Bicentennial [[fireworks]] in Colombia]]

[[Fireworks]] are a part of many public entertainments and have retained an enduring popularity since they became a "crowning feature of elaborate celebrations" in the 17th century. First used in China, classical antiquity and Europe for military purposes, fireworks were most popular in the 18th century and high prices were paid for [[Pyrotechnics|pyrotechnists]], especially the skilled Italian ones, who were summoned to other countries to organise displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Giacomo Casanova|last=Casanova|first=Giacomo Chevalier de Seingalt|title=History of My Life, Volumes 9–10 Vol 10|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland; London|isbn=0-8018-5666-3|page=333|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Jack|title=Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World|year=2005|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-03722-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire and water were important aspects of court spectacles because the displays "inspired by means of fire, sudden noise, smoke and general magnificence the sentiments thought fitting for the subject to entertain of his sovereign: awe fear and a vicarious sense of glory in his might. Birthdays, name-days, weddings and anniversaries provided the occasion for celebration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagarra|first=Eda|title=A Social History of Germany 1648–1914|year=2003|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-7658-0982-7|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous courtly uses of fireworks was one used to celebrate the end of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and while the fireworks themselves caused a fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Christopher Hogwood|last=Hogwood|first=Christopher|title=Handel: Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83636-4|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; the accompanying [[Music for the Royal Fireworks]] written by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] has been popular ever since. Aside from their contribution to entertainments related to military successes, courtly displays and personal celebrations, fireworks are also used as part of religious ceremony. For example, during the Indian [[Dashavatar]]a Kala of Gomantaka "the temple deity is taken around in a procession with a lot of singing, dancing and display of fireworks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varadpande|first=Manohar Laxman|title=History of Indian Theatre (vol. 2)|year=1992|publisher=Shakti Malik Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7017-278-0|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "fire, sudden noise and smoke" of fireworks is still a significant part of public celebration and entertainment. For example, fireworks were one of the primary forms of display chosen to celebrate the turn of the [[millennium]] around the world. As the clock struck midnight and 1999 became 2000, firework displays and open-air parties greeted the [[New Year]] as the [[time zone]]s changed over to the next century. Fireworks, carefully planned and choreographed, were let off against the backdrop of many of the world's most famous buildings, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids of Giza]] in Egypt, the [[Acropolis]] in Athens, [[Red Square]] in Moscow, [[Vatican City]] in Rome, the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in Berlin, the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, and [[Elizabeth Tower]] in London.

=== Sport ===
{{Main|Sport}}
[[File:Tifosi fiorentina.jpg|thumb|Tifosi fiorentina|Audience engagement from a crowd of Italian sport fans]]
[[File:2010 FIFA World Cup Fans.jpg|thumb|Audience engagement by individual South African fans at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] ]]

[[Sports|Sporting]] competitions have always provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the players from the audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in [[stadium]] and [[auditorium]] design, as well as in recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and [[spectator sport]] has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are [[association football]] and [[cricket]]. Their ultimate international competitions, the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and [[test cricket]], are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sport Marketing|year=2007|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-6052-3|authors=Hardy, Stephen; Sutton, William Anthony|editor=Mullin, Bernard James}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the [[Tour de France]], unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Christopher S.|title=The Tour de France: A Cultural History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles; London|isbn=978-0-520-25630-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from sports that have world-wide appeal and competitions, such as the [[Olympic Games]], the entertainment value of a sport depends on the culture and country where people play it. For example, in the United States, [[baseball]] and [[basketball]] games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is [[rugby union]]; in Iran, it is [[freestyle wrestling]]. Japan's unique [[sumo]] wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kubota|first=Makoto|title=Sumo|year=1999|publisher=Chronicle Books Llc|isbn=0-8118-2548-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as the international running group [[Hash House Harriers]], participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component is more important than the competitive.

The evolution of an activity into a sport and then an entertainment is also affected by the local climate and conditions. For example, the modern sport of [[History of surfing|surfing]] is associated with Hawaii and that of [[History of skiing|snow skiing]] probably evolved in Scandinavia. While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators have spread around the world, people in the two originating countries remain well known for their prowess. Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt another sport such as in the case of [[ice hockey]]—an important entertainment in Canada.

=== Fairs, expositions, shopping ===
{{Main|Fair|World's fair}}
[[Fair]]s and exhibitions have existed since ancient and medieval times, displaying wealth, innovations and objects for trade and offering specific entertainments as well as being places of entertainment in themselves.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Robert|title=Great Exhibitions: The World Fairs 1851–1937|year=2007|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|isbn=978-0-7241-0284-6|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether in a medieval market or a small shop, "shopping always offered forms of exhilaration that took one away from the everyday".&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite book|last=Moss|first=Mark Howard|title=Shopping as an Entertainment Experience|year=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland; Plymouth, UK|page=3|isbn=978-0-7391-1680-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the modern world, "merchandising has become entertainment: spinning signs, flashing signs, thumping music&amp;nbsp;... video screens, interactive computer kiosks, day care .. cafés".&lt;ref name=Moss/&gt;

By the 19th century, "expos" that encouraged arts, manufactures and commerce had become international. They were not only hugely popular but affected international ideas. For example, the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Paris Exposition]] facilitated international cooperation about ideas, innovations and standards. From London 1851 to Paris 1900, "in excess of 200 million visitors had entered the turnstiles in London, Paris, Vienna, Philadelphia, Chicago and a myriad of smaller shows around the world."&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Colombian Exposition of 1893|url=http://columbus.gl.iit.edu/|publisher=Chicago Illinois Institute of Technology|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[World War II]] "well over 500 million visits have been recorded through world expo turnstiles".&lt;ref name=Boisseau&gt;{{cite book|title=Gendering the Fair: Histories of Women and Gender at World's Fairs|year=2010|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-252-03558-6|authors=Rydell, Robert; Boisseau, T.J.; Markwyn, Abigail M.; Rydell, Robert W.|editor=Boisseau, T.J.|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of spectacle and entertainment, expositions influenced "everything from architecture, to patterns of globalisation, to fundamental matters of human identity"&lt;ref name=Boisseau/&gt; and in the process established the close relationship between "fairs, the rise of department stores and art museums",&lt;ref name=Rydell&gt;{{cite book|last=Rydell|first=Robert W.|title=World of Fairs: The Century-of-Progress Expositions|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-73236-3|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the modern world of mass consumption and the entertainment industry.

== Safety ==
Some entertainments, such as at large festivals (whether religious or secular), concerts, clubs, parties and celebrations, involve big crowds. From earliest times, crowds at an entertainment have associated hazards and dangers, especially when combined with the recreational consumption of [[Recreational drug use|intoxicants]] such as alcohol. The Ancient Greeks had [[Dionysian Mysteries]], for example, and the Romans had [[Saturnalia]]. The consequence of excess and crowds can produce breaches of [[Norm (social)|social norms]] of behaviour, sometimes causing injury or even death, such as for example, at the [[Altamont Free Concert]], an outdoor [[rock festival]]. The list of [[Nightclub#Serious incidents|serious incidents at nightclubs]] includes those caused by [[stampede]]; overcrowding; terrorism, such as the [[2002 Bali bombings]] that targeted a nightclub; and especially fire. Investigations, such as that carried out in the US after [[The Station nightclub fire]] often demonstrate that lessons learned "regarding fire safety in nightclubs" from earlier events such as the [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] do "not necessarily result in lasting effective change".&lt;ref name=Tubbs&gt;{{cite book|last=Tubbs|first=Jeffrey|title=Egress Design Solutions: A Guide to Evacuation and Crowd Management Planning|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-71956-4|page=83|author2=Meacham, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to prevent such incidents include appointing special officers, such as the medieval [[Lord of Misrule]] or, in modern times, [[security officers]] who control access; and also ongoing improvement of relevant [[International Organization for Standardization|standards]] such as those for building safety. The [[tourism]] industry now regards safety and security at entertainment venues as an important management task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Tourism, security and safety: from theory to practice | author1=Mansfeld, Yoel  | author2=Pizam, Abraham  | date = 2006 |location = Burlington, Mass.|publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann  | isbn=0750678984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
Although kings, rulers and powerful people have always been able to pay for entertainment to be provided for them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein|first=Andi|title=An Introduction to the Entertainment Industry|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4331-0341-4|author2=Evans, Beth Bingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Key issues in the arts and entertainment industry|publisher=Goodfellow Publishers |location=Woodeaton, Oxford|isbn=1-906884-20-X|editor=Walmsley, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes referred to as [[show business]], the industry relies on [[business model]]s to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sickels|first=Robert C|title=The Business of Entertainment|publisher=Greenwood Publishing (Three Volumes)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Harold L.|title=Entertainment industry economics: a guide for financial analysis|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-87485-8|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[film industry]] is a part of the entertainment industry. Components of it include the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/hollywood|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mid Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/bollywood|publisher=Mid Day|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; film industries, as well as the [[cinema of the United Kingdom]] and all the [[Cinema of Europe|cinemas of Europe]], including [[cinema of France|France]], [[cinema of Germany|Germany]], [[cinema of Spain|Spain]], [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Casper|first=Drew|title=Postwar Hollywood, 1946–1962|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-4051-5074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sex industry]] is another component of the entertainment industry, applying the same forms and media (for example, film, books, dance and other performances) to the development, marketing and sale of sex products on a commercial basis.

[[Amusement park]]s entertain paying guests with [[rides]], such as [[roller coasters]], [[ridable miniature railway]]s, [[water rides]], and [[dark rides]], as well as other events and associated attractions. The parks are built on a large area subdivided into themed areas named "lands". Sometimes the whole amusement park is based on one theme, such as the various [[SeaWorld]] parks that focus on the theme of sea life.

One of the consequences of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of [[employment]]. While jobs such as [[writer]], musician and [[composer]] exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]] or [[special effect]]s supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.

Prestigious [[List of prizes, medals, and awards|awards are given by the industry]] for excellence in the various types of entertainment. For example, there are awards for Music, Games (including video games), Comics, Comedy, Theatre, Television, Film, Dance and Magic. Sporting awards are made for the results and skill, rather than for the entertainment value.

=== Architecture for entertainment ===
Purpose-built structures as venues for entertainment that accommodate audiences have produced many famous and innovative buildings, among the most recognisable of which are [[Theatre (structure)|theatre structures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhouse|first=Victoria|title=Site and sound: the architecture and acoustics of new opera houses and concert halls|year=2012|publisher=Monacelli Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58093-281-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Greeks, "the architectural importance of the theatre is a reflection of their importance to the community, made apparent in their monumentality, in the effort put into their design, and in the care put into their detail."&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;Green, J.R. "The Theatre of Paphos and the Theatre of Alexandria: Some First Thoughts" in {{cite book |title=The Library of Alexandria |year=2002 |publisher=The American University in Cairo Press |location=Cairo |isbn=977-424-710-8 |editor=MacLeod, Roy}} p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans subsequently developed the stadium in an oval form known as a [[Circus (building)|circus]]. In modern times, some of the grandest buildings for entertainment have brought fame to their cities as well as their designers. The [[Sydney Opera House]], for example, is a [[World Heritage Site]] and [[The O₂ (London)|The O₂]] in London is an entertainment precinct that contains an indoor [[arena]], a music club, a cinema and exhibition space. The [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]] in Germany is a theatre designed and built for performances of one specific musical composition.

Two of the chief architectural concerns for the design of venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. The speed at which the venue empty is important both for amenity and safety, because large crowds take a long time to disperse from a badly designed venue, which creates a safety risk. The [[Hillsborough disaster]] is an example of how poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. [[Sightline]]s and [[acoustics]] are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.

In the 21st century, entertainment venues, especially stadia, are "likely to figure among the leading architectural genres".&lt;ref name=Sheard&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheard|first=Rod|title=Sports Architecture|year=2001|publisher=Spon Press|location=London|isbn=0-419-21220-5|ref=CITEREFSheard2001}} p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they require "a whole new approach" to design, because they need to be "sophisticated entertainment centres, multi-experience venues, capable of being enjoyed in many diverse ways".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}} Hence, architects now have to design "with two distinct functions in mind, as sports and entertainment centres playing host to live audiences, and as sports and entertainment studios serving the viewing and listening requirements of the remote audience".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

=== Architecture as entertainment ===
[[File:Sleepingbeautycastle50.jpg|[[Sleeping Beauty]]|thumb|left|Inauthentic castle in [[Disneyland]] amusement park]]
Architects who push the boundaries of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed the expectations of the public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]], designed by [[Frank Gehry]], are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really [[folly|follies]], deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical.

On the other hand, sometimes architecture is entertainment, while pretending to be functional. The tourism industry, for example, creates or renovates buildings as "attractions" that have either never been used or can never be used for their ostensible purpose. They are instead re-purposed to entertain visitors often by simulating cultural experiences. Buildings, history and sacred spaces are thus made into commodities for purchase. Such intentional tourist attractions divorce buildings from the past so that "the difference between historical authenticity and contemporary entertainment venues/theme parks becomes hard to define".&lt;ref name=Lasansky&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFLasansky2004|last=Lasansky|first=D. Medina|title=Architecture and Tourism: Perception, Performance and Place|year=2004|edition=English|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=1-85973-709-9|author2=McLaren, Brian}} p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include "the preservation of the [[Alcázar of Toledo]], with its grim Civil War History, the conversion of slave dungeons into tourist attractions in Ghana, [such as, for example, [[Cape Coast Castle]]] and the presentation of indigenous culture in Libya".{{sfnp|Lasansky|2004|p=xvii, Part II, Ch. 4, 5, 6}} The specially constructed buildings in amusement parks represent the park's theme and are usually neither authentic nor completely functional.

== Effects of developments in electronic media ==

=== Globalisation ===
By the second half of the 20th century, developments in electronic [[Media (communication)|media]] made possible the delivery of entertainment products to mass audiences across the globe. The technology enabled people to see, hear and participate in all the familiar forms{{snd}} stories, theatre, music, dance{{snd}} wherever they live. The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in [[data storage device]]s such as [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] or [[compact disc]]s, along with increasing [[miniaturisation]]. Computerisation and the development of [[barcodes]] also made ticketing easier, faster and global.

=== Obsolescence ===
In the 1940s, [[radio]] was the electronic medium for family entertainment and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garratt|first=G.R.M.|title=The early history of radio: from Faraday to Marconi|year=1994|publisher=Institution of Electrical Engineers, in association with the Science Museum|location=London|isbn=0-85296-845-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radio reader: essays in the cultural history of radio|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-92820-6|editor1=Hilmes, Michele |editor2=Loviglio, Jason }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Jim|title=The great radio sitcoms|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3146-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, it was [[television]] that was the new medium and it rapidly became global, bringing visual entertainment, first in black and white, then in colour, to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spigel|first=Lynn|title=Make room for TV: television and the family ideal in postwar America|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-76966-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, [[history of video games|games]] could be played electronically, then [[Handheld video game|hand-held]] devices provided mobile entertainment, and by the last decade of the 20th century, via [[online game|networked play]]. In combination with products from the entertainment industry, all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally. People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music, film or game, they could choose the time and place to use it. The "proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption" together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films.&lt;ref name=Tryon&gt;{{cite book|last=Tryon|first=Chuck|title=Reinventing Cinema: Movies in the Age of Media Convergence|year=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|pages=6, 9|isbn=978-0-8135-4546-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid [[obsolescence]] of the various recording and storage methods. As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media, over the course of one generation, television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown, to novel, to ubiquitous and finally to superseded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Television after TV: Essays on a Medium in Transition|year=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3383-X|editors=Spigel, Lynn; Olsson, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a [[Wii]] console, "about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953".&lt;ref name=Cogburn&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogburn|first=Jon|title=Philosophy Through Video Games|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-98857-8|page=i|author2=Silcox, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, online entertainment would have completely replaced television—which didn't happen. The so-called "[[digital revolution]]" has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments, business, industries, and individuals, as they all try to keep up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Gillian|title=Media Ownership: The Economics and Politics of Convergence and Concentration in the UK and European Media|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|format=Google eBook|isbn=0-7619-6680-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=John|title=Scheduling: the last creative act in television?|journal=Media Culture Society|date=January 2000|volume=22|series=Bournemouth University/Large Door Productions|issue=1|pages=25–38|doi=10.1177/016344300022001002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the UK: {{cite web|last=Tryhorn|first=Chris|title=Government thinktank to tackle media convergence issues|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 November 2012|date=21 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;And for example, in Australia: {{cite web|title=Convergence Review|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|date=30 April 2012|publisher=Australian Government: Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy|accessdate=23 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the sports stadium of the future will increasingly compete with television viewing "...in terms of comfort, safety and the constant flow of audio-visual information and entertainment available."{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=49}} Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes, where television, regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents, will need to be replaced by access to the internet. At the same time, the ongoing need for entertainers as "professional engagers" shows the continuity of traditional entertainment.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;{{cite news|last=Power|first=Julie|title=Laughter and music better than drugs for dementia patients|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/laughter-and-music-better-than-drugs-for-dementia-patients-20130802-2r4w9.html|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergence ===
By the second decade of the 21st century, [[analogue recording]] was being replaced by [[digital recording]] and all forms of electronic entertainment began to [[technological convergence|converge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwyer|first=Tim|title=Media Convergence|year=2010|publisher=Open University Press McGraw-Hill Education|location=Maidenhead, Berkshire, England and New York|isbn=978-0-335-22873-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, convergence is challenging standard practices in the film industry: whereas "success or failure used to be determined by the first weekend of its run. Today,&amp;nbsp;... a series of exhibition 'windows', such as DVD, pay-per-view, and fibre-optic video-on-demand are used to maximise profits."{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=156}} Part of the industry's adjustment is its release of new commercial product directly via video hosting services. Media convergence is said to be more than technological: the convergence is cultural as well.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|pp=22, 30 ''ff''}} It is also "the result of a deliberate effort to protect the interests of business entities, policy institutions and other groups".&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt; Globalisation and [[cultural imperialism]] are two of the cultural consequences of convergence.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=30}} Others include [[fandom]] and interactive storytelling as well as the way that single franchises are distributed through and affect a range of delivery methods.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Henry|title=Convergence culture: where old and new media collide|year=2006|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-4281-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "greater diversity in the ways that signals may be received and packaged for the viewer, via terrestrial, satellite or cable television, and of course, via the Internet" also affects entertainment venues, such as sports stadia, which now need to be designed so that both live and remote audiences can interact in increasingly sophisticated ways{{snd}} for example, audiences can "watch highlights, call up statistics", "order tickets and merchandise" and generally "tap into the stadium's resources at any time of the day or night".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

The introduction of television altered the availability, cost, variety and quality of entertainment products for the public and the convergence of online entertainment is having a similar effect. For example, the possibility and popularity of user-generated content, as distinct from commercial product, creates a "networked audience model [that] makes programming obsolete".{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=536}} Individuals and corporations use [[video hosting service]]s to broadcast content that is equally accepted by the public as legitimate entertainment.

While technology increases demand for entertainment products and offers increased speed of delivery, the forms that make up the content are in themselves, relatively stable. Storytelling, music, theatre, dance and games are recognisably the same as in earlier centuries.

[[Image:EqualJusticeUnderLaw.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The front of the Supreme Court Building, including the West Pediment.]]
'''Equal justice under law''' is a phrase engraved on the front of the [[United States Supreme Court building]] in [[Washington D.C.]]  It is also a societal ideal that has influenced [[Law of the United States|the American legal system]].

The phrase was proposed by the building's architects, and then approved by judges of the Court in 1932.  It is based upon [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] jurisprudence, and has historical antecedents dating back to [[ancient Greece]].

==Proposed by architects and approved by justices==
[[File:Van Devanter and Hughes.jpg|thumb|right|Justice Van Devanter (left) and Chief Justice Hughes]]This phrase was suggested in 1932 by the architectural firm that designed the building.&lt;ref&gt;Pusey, Merlo.  ''Charles Evans Hughes'', Volume 2,  p. 689 (Columbia University Press 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] and Justice [[Willis Van Devanter]] subsequently approved this inscription, as did the United States Supreme Court Building Commission which Hughes chaired (and on which Van Devanter served).&lt;ref&gt;[{{SCOTUS URL|about/westpediment.pdf}}  West Pediment Information Sheet] via U.S. Supreme Court web site.  At that time, the other members of the Commission were Senator [[Henry W. Keyes]], Senator [[James A. Reed]], Representative [[Richard N. Elliott]], Representative [[Fritz G. Lanham]], and Architect of the Capitol [[David Lynn (architect)|David Lynn]].  See Liu, Honxia.  "[http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr40_3and4/CR40-3Liu.pdf Court Gazing: Features of Diversity in the Supreme Court Building]", ''Court Review'' (Winter 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slogan /&gt;

The architectural firm that proposed the phrase was headed by [[Cass Gilbert]], though Gilbert himself was much more interested in design and arrangement, than in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, Priscilla.  "A Closer Look at the Bronze Courtroom Gates", ''Supreme Court Quarterly'', Vol. 9, p. 8 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, according to [[David Lynn (architect)|David Lynn]] who at that time held the position of [[Architect of the Capitol]], the two people at Gilbert's firm who were responsible for the slogan "equal justice under law" were Gilbert's son (Cass Gilbert, Jr.) and Gilbert's partner, John R. Rockart.&lt;ref name=slogan&gt;McGurn, Barrett.  "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130226111758/http://www.supremecourthistory.org/wp-content/themes/supremecourthistory/inc/schs_publications-1982.pdf Slogans to Fit the Occasion]", pp. 170-174, ''United States Supreme Court Yearbook'' (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the journalist [[Herbert Bayard Swope]] objected to Chief Justice Hughes about this inscription, urging that the word "equal" be removed because such a "qualification" renders the phrase too narrow; the equality principle would still be implied without that word, Swope said.  Hughes refused, writing that it was appropriate to "place a strong emphasis upon impartiality".&lt;ref name=slogan /&gt;

This legal soundbite atop the Court is perceived differently by different people, sometimes as ostentatious, often as profound, and occasionally as vacuous.&lt;ref name=Chen /&gt; According to law professor [[Jim Chen]], it is common for people to "suggest that disagreement with some contestable legal proposition or another would be tantamount to chiseling or sandblasting 'Equal Justice Under Law' from the Supreme Court's portico."&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;Chen, Jim.  "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=773025 Come Back to the Nickel and Five: Tracing the Warren Court's Pursuit of Equal Justice Under Law]", ''Washington and Lee Law Review'', Vol. 59, pp. 1305-1306 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase may be perceived in a variety of ways, but it very distinctly does not say "equal law under justice", which would have meant that the judiciary can prioritize justice over law.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Milner. ''Lying Down Together: Law, Metaphor and Theology'', p. 23 (Univ. of Wisconsin Press 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Based upon Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence==
The words "equal justice under law" paraphrase an earlier expression coined in 1891 by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=Cabraser&gt;Cabraser, Elizabeth.  "The Essentials of Democratic Mass Litigation", ''Columbia Journal of Law &amp; Social Problems'', Vol. 45, p. 499, 500 (Summer 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peccarelli, Anthony.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070203153539/http://www.dcba.org/brief/marissue/2000/art10300.htm "The Meaning of Justice"], ''DuPage County Bar Association Brief'' (March 2000), via Archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of ''Caldwell v. Texas'', Chief Justice [[Melville Fuller]] wrote on behalf of a unanimous Court as follows, regarding the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]: "the powers of the States in dealing with crime within their borders are not limited, but no State can deprive particular persons or classes of persons of equal and impartial justice under the law."&lt;ref&gt;''Caldwell v. Texas'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/137/692/case.html 137 U.S. 692] (1891).&lt;/ref&gt;  The last seven words are summarized by the inscription on the U.S. Supreme Court building.&lt;ref name=Cabraser /&gt;

[[File:The Fuller Court.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Chief Justice Fuller (front center) wrote for a unanimous Court in ''Caldwell''.  In this 1899 photo, Justice Harlan is seated to his right, and Justice Peckham is standing to Harlan's right.]]Later in 1891, Fuller's opinion for the Court in ''Leeper v. Texas'' again referred to "equal...justice under...law".&lt;ref name=Leeper&gt;''Leeper v. Texas'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=9HoYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA225&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;ots=bAWQjPsX_q&amp;dq=%22borders+are+not+limited,+except+that+no+State+can+deprive+particular+%22&amp;output=html 139 U.S. 462] (1891).  Fuller's opinion in ''Leeper'' stated: "It must be regarded as settled that....by the Fourteenth Amendment the powers of States in dealing with crime within their borders are not limited, except that no State can deprive particular persons, or classes of persons, of equal and impartial justice under the law; that law in its regular course of administration through courts of justice is due process, and when secured by the law of the State the constitutional requirement is satisfied; and that due process is so secured by laws operating on all alike, and not subjecting the individual to the arbitrary exercise of the powers of government unrestrained by the established principles of private right and distributive justice."&lt;/ref&gt;  Like ''Caldwell'', the ''Leeper'' opinion was unanimous, in contrast to the Fuller Court's major disagreements about equality issues in other cases such as ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aside from Fuller, the members of the Court in 1891 were as follows: [[Joseph P. Bradley]], [[Stephen Johnson Field]], [[John Marshall Harlan]], [[Horace Gray]], [[Samuel Blatchford]], [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II|Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar]], [[David Josiah Brewer]], and [[Henry Billings Brown]].   The Fuller Court most famously disagreed about equality issues in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', 163 U.S. 537 (1896).&lt;/ref&gt;  

In both ''Caldwell'' and ''Leeper'', murder [[indictment]]s were challenged because they allegedly gave inadequate notice of the crimes being charged.  The Court upheld the indictments because they followed the form required by Texas law.&lt;Ref&gt;Stuntz, William.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nEHgwemq0nYC&amp;pg=PA124 The Collapse of American Criminal Justice]'', p. 124 (Harvard U. Press 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In a case nine years later (''[[Maxwell v. Dow]]''), the Court quoted the "equal...justice under...law" phrase that it had used in ''Caldwell'' and ''Leeper'', to make the point that Utah could devise its own criminal procedure, as long as defendants are "proceeded against by the same kind of procedure and ... have the same kind of trial, and the equal protection of the laws is secured to them."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Maxwell v. Dow]]'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/176/581/case.html 176 U.S. 581] (1900); Justice Peckham wrote the Court's opinion, and Justice Harlan was the sole dissenter.  Harlan argued that a person cannot be tried for an infamous crime by a jury of less than twelve persons, instead of the eight jurors allowed in Utah.  Many years later, in ''[[Williams v. Florida]]'', 399 U.S. 78 (1970), the Court held that six jurors are enough.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1908 case of ''Ughbanks v. Armstrong'', the Fuller Court yet again discussed the Fourteenth Amendment in similar terms, but this time mentioning punishments:  "The last-named Amendment was not intended to, and does not, limit the powers of a State in dealing with crime committed within its own borders or with the punishment thereof, although no State can deprive particular persons or classes of persons of equal and impartial justice under the law."&lt;ref&gt;''Ughbanks v. Armstrong'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/208/481/case.html 208 U.S. 481] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Ughbanks''  was a [[burglary]] case, and the opinion was written for the Court by Justice [[Rufus Wheeler Peckham|Rufus Peckham]], while Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] was the sole dissenter.  The Court would later reject the idea that the Fourteenth Amendment does not limit punishments (see the 1962 case of ''[[Robinson v. California]]'').  

In the years since moving into their present building, the Supreme Court has often connected the words "equal justice under law" with the Fourteenth Amendment.  For example, in the 1958 case of ''[[Cooper v. Aaron]]'', the Court said: "The Constitution created a government dedicated to equal justice under law. The Fourteenth Amendment embodied and emphasized that ideal."&lt;ref&gt;''Cooper v. Aaron'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/358/1/case.html 358 U.S. 1] (1958).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Raneta and Kelly, Michael.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vsTP_KhsulsC&amp;pg=PT36 Equal Justice in the Balance: America's Legal Responses to the Emerging Terrorist Threat]'', p. 16 (U. Mich. Press 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  

The words "equal justice under law" are not in [[United States Constitution|the Constitution]], which instead says that no state shall "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah.

[[Image:Pericles3.JPG|thumb|right|Pericles, Greek statesman and general]]In [[Pericles' Funeral Oration|the funeral oration]] that he delivered in 431 BC, the [[Athens|Athenian]] leader [[Pericles]] encouraged belief in what we now call equal justice under law.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, George.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cC06AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA171 Law for the Public Speaker: Legal Aspects of Public Address]'', p. 171 (Christopher Pub. House, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, when  Chief Justice Fuller wrote his opinion in ''Caldwell v. Texas'', he was by no means the first to discuss this concept.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]]'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/356/case.html 118 U.S. 356] (1886):  "Though the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution."&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several different English translations of the relevant passage in Pericles' funeral oration.  

Here is Pericles discussing "equal justice" according to the English translation by Richard Crawley in 1874:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighbouring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favours the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/plpwr10.txt The History of the Peloponnesian War]'', Written 431 B.C.E, Translated by Richard Crawley (1874), retrieved via Project Gutenberg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The English translation by [[Benjamin Jowett]] in 1881 likewise had Pericles saying: "the law secures equal justice to all alike in their private disputes".&lt;ref&gt;Jowett, Benjamin. ''[http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/thucydides/jthucbk2rv2.htm Thucydides, translated into English, to which is prefixed an essay on inscriptions and a note on the geography of Thucydides,]'' Second edition, Oxford, Clarendon Press (1900): "Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the institutions of others. We do not copy our neighbours, but are an example to them. It is true that we are called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few. But while the law secures equal justice to all alike in their private disputes, the claim of excellence is also recognised; and when a citizen is in any way distinguished, he is preferred to the public service, not as a matter of privilege, but as the reward of merit. Neither is poverty a bar, but a man may benefit his country whatever be the obscurity of his condition."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  And, the English translation by [[Rex Warner]] in 1954 had Pericles saying: "there exists equal justice to all and alike in their private disputes".&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Pericles's Funeral Oration|Pericles's Funeral Oration]]'', translated by Rex Warner (1954), via wikisource: "Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the institutions of others. Our government does not copy our neighbors', but is an example to them. It is true that we are called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few. But while there exists equal justice to all and alike in their private disputes, the claim of excellence is also recognized; and when a citizen is in any way distinguished, he is preferred to the public service, not as a matter of privilege, but as the reward of merit. Neither is poverty an obstacle, but a man may benefit his country whatever the obscurity of his condition."&lt;/ref&gt;  The funeral oration by Pericles was published in [[Thucydides]]’ ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', of which there are [[History of the Peloponnesian War#Translations|several other English translations]].  

As quoted above, Pericles said that a person's wealth or prominence should not influence his eligibility for public employment or affect the justice he receives.  Similarly, Chief Justice Hughes defended the inscription "equal justice under law" by referring to the judicial [[oath of office]], which requires judges to "administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich".&lt;ref name=slogan /&gt; Decades later, Supreme Court Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] made a similar point: "The principles which would have governed with $10,000 at stake should also govern when thousands have become billions. That is the essence of equal justice under law."&lt;ref&gt;''Pennzoil v. Texaco'', [http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/481/1/case.html 481 U.S. 1] (1987)(Thurgood Marshall, concurring in the judgment).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-04-11/news/8701270894_1_texas-courts-texaco-federal-court How To Handle A Texas-sized Lawsuit]", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' (April 11, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the notion of '''externology''' in a [[topological space]] ''X'' generalizes the basic properties of the family

: &lt;big&gt;''ε''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; = {E ⊆ X : X\E is a closed compact subset of X}&lt;/big&gt;

of [[Complement (set theory)|complements]] of the [[Closed set|closed]] [[Compact space|compact]] [[topological subspace|subspaces]] of ''X'', which are used to construct its [[Alexandroff compactification]]. An externology permits to introduce a notion of end&lt;ref name=ncatlab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/proper+homotopy+theory|title=proper homotopy theory in nLab|website=ncatlab.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; point, to study the divergence of [[Net (mathematics)|nets]] in terms of convergence to end points and it is a useful tool for the study and classification of some families of non compact topological spaces. It can also be used to approach a topological space as the [[Limit (category theory)|limit]] of other topological spaces: the externologies are very useful when a compact [[metric space]] embedded in a [[Hilbert cube|Hilbert space]] is approached by its [[open neighbourhood]]s.

== Definition ==
Let &lt;big&gt;(X,τ)&lt;/big&gt; be a topological space. An '''externology''' on &lt;big&gt;(X,τ)&lt;/big&gt; is a non-empty collection &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;/big&gt; of [[open subsets]] satisfying:
* If &lt;big&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ε&lt;/big&gt;, then &lt;big&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ε&lt;/big&gt;;
* if &lt;big&gt;E ∈ ε, U ∈ τ&lt;/big&gt; and &lt;big&gt;E ⊆ U&lt;/big&gt;, then &lt;big&gt;U ∈ ε&lt;/big&gt;.

An '''''exterior space''''' &lt;big&gt;(X,τ,ε)&lt;/big&gt; consists of a topological space &lt;big&gt;(X,τ)&lt;/big&gt; together with an externology &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;/big&gt;. An open &lt;big&gt;E&lt;/big&gt; which is in &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;/big&gt; is said to be an '''exterior-open subset'''. A map &lt;big&gt;f:(X,τ,ε) → (X',τ',ε')&lt;/big&gt; is said to be an '''exterior map''' if it is [[Continuous map|continuous]] and  &lt;big&gt;f&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(E) ∈ ε&lt;/big&gt;, for all &lt;big&gt;E ∈ ε'&lt;/big&gt;.

The [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of exterior spaces and exterior maps will be denoted by '''E'''. It is remarkable that '''E''' is a [[Complete category|complete]] and [[Complete category|cocomplete]] category.

== Some examples of exterior spaces ==
* For a space &lt;big&gt;(X,τ)&lt;/big&gt; one can always consider the ''trivial externology'' &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;sub&gt;tr&lt;/sub&gt;={X}&lt;/big&gt;, and, on the other hand, the ''total externology'' &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;=τ&lt;/big&gt;. Note that an externology &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;/big&gt; is a [[topological space|topology]] if and only if the empty set is a member of &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;/big&gt; if and only if &lt;big&gt;ε=τ&lt;/big&gt;.
* Given a space &lt;big&gt;(X,τ)&lt;/big&gt;, the externology &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; of the complements of closed compact subsets of &lt;big&gt;X&lt;/big&gt; permits a connection with the theory of [[proper map]]s.
* Given a space &lt;big&gt;(X,τ)&lt;/big&gt; and a subset &lt;big&gt;A⊆X&lt;/big&gt; the family &lt;big&gt;ε(X,A)={U⊆X:A⊆U,U∈τ}&lt;/big&gt; is an externology in &lt;big&gt;X&lt;/big&gt;. Two particular cases with important applications on [[Shape theory (mathematics)|shape theory]] and on [[dynamical systems]], respectively, are the following:
* If &lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt; is a closed subspace of the [[Hilbert cube]] &lt;big&gt;X=Q&lt;/big&gt; the externology &lt;big&gt;ε&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;=ε(Q,A)&lt;/big&gt; is a resolution of &lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt; in the sense of the shape theory.
* Let &lt;big&gt;X&lt;/big&gt; be a [[continuous dynamical system]] and &lt;big&gt;P&lt;/big&gt; the subset of [[periodic point]]s; we can consider the externology &lt;big&gt;ε(X,P)&lt;/big&gt;. More generally, if &lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt; is an invariant subset the externology &lt;big&gt;ε(X,A)&lt;/big&gt; is useful to study the dynamical properties of the [[Dynamical system|flow]].

== Applications of exterior spaces ==
* ''Proper homotopy theory'':&lt;ref name=ncatlab/&gt; A continuous map &lt;big&gt;f:X→Y&lt;/big&gt; between topological spaces is said to be ''[[Proper map|proper]]'' if for every closed compact subset &lt;big&gt;K&lt;/big&gt; of &lt;big&gt;Y&lt;/big&gt;, &lt;big&gt;f&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(K)&lt;/big&gt; is a compact subset of &lt;big&gt;X&lt;/big&gt;. The category of spaces and proper maps will be denoted by '''P'''. This category and the corresponding proper [[homotopy category]] are very useful for the study of non compact spaces. Nevertheless, one has the problem that this category does not have enough limits and colimits and then we can not develop the usual homotopy constructions like [[loop space|loops]], homotopy limits and colimits, etc. An answer to this problem is the category of exterior spaces '''E''' which admits [[Model category|Quillen model structures]] and contains as a [[full subcategory]] the category of spaces and proper maps; that is, there is [[Full functor|full]] and [[Faithful functor|faithful]] [[functor]] &lt;big&gt;'''P'''→'''E'''&lt;/big&gt; which carries a topological space &lt;big&gt;(X,τ)&lt;/big&gt; to the exterior space &lt;big&gt;(X,τ,ε&lt;sup&gt;X&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;.
* ''Proper [[Lusternik–Schnirelmann category|LS category]]'': The problem of finding Ganea and Whitehead characterizations of this proper invariant can not be faced within the proper category because of the lack of (co)limits. Nevertheless, an extension of this invariant to the category of exterior spaces permits to find a solution to such a problem. This numerical proper invariant has been applied to the study of open 3-[[manifolds]].
* ''[[Shape theory (mathematics)|Shape theory]]'': Many [[Shape theory (mathematics)|shape]] invariants (Borsuk groups, Quigley inward and approaching groups) of a compact [[metric space]] can be obtained as exterior homotopy groups of the exterior space determined by the open neighborhoods of a compact metric space embedded in the Hilbert cube.
* ''Discrete and continuous dynamical systems (semi-flows and flows)'': There are many constructions that associate an exterior space to a dynamical system, for example: Given a continuous (discrete) flow one can consider the exterior spaces induced by the open neighborhoods of the subset of [[periodic point]]s, Poisson periodic points, [[omega limit]]s, etc. The constructions and properties of these associated exterior spaces are used to study the dynamical properties of the (semi-flow) flow.

{{Conflict of laws}}
'''''Forum non conveniens''''' ([[Latin]] for "forum not agreeing") ('''FNC''') is a (mostly) [[common law]] [[legal doctrine]] whereby courts may refuse to take jurisdiction over matters where there is a more appropriate forum available to the parties. As a doctrine of the [[conflict of laws]], ''forum non conveniens'' applies between courts in different countries and between courts in different [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s in the same country. ''Forum non conveniens'' is not applicable between counties or federal districts within a state.

A concern often raised in applications of the doctrine is [[forum shopping]], or picking a court merely to gain an advantage in the proceeding. This concern is balanced against the public policy of deferring to a plaintiff's choice of venue in claims where there may be more than one appropriate jurisdiction. The underlying principles, such as basing respect given to foreign courts on reciprocal respect or [[comity]], also apply in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems in the form of the legal doctrine of ''[[lis alibi pendens]]''.

''Forum non conveniens'' is not exclusive to common law nations: the maritime courts of the [[Republic of Panama]], although not a common law jurisdiction, also have such power under more restrained conditions.&lt;ref&gt;ARRUE MONTENEGRO, Carlos Alberto. ''Le forum non conveniens à l'assaut des compétences exorbitantes : l'expérience panaméenne'', [[Panthéon-Assas University]],  2006, p. 85. (http://catalogue.ppl.nl/DB=1/SET=1/TTL=1/SHW?FRST=2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
A [[jurisdiction (area)|country, state, or other jurisdiction]] enacts laws which are interpreted and applied through a system of courts. The laws applied by a particular system of courts or legal system are termed the ''[[lex fori]]'', or law of the forum. As a matter of [[civil procedure]], courts must decide whether and in what circumstances they will accept [[jurisdiction]] over [[party (law)|parties]] and subject matter when a [[lawsuit]] begins. This decision will be routine, or not raised at all, if the relevant elements of the case are within the territorial jurisdiction of the court. If one or more of the parties resides outside the territorial [[jurisdiction]] or there are other factors which might make another forum more appropriate, the question of jurisdiction must be settled.

===Historical origin===
Scholars and jurists seem to find a Scottish origin prior to the first American use of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mssc.state.ms.us/decisions/Publishedopinions/96-01284.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judicium.it/news/pistis01.html#_edn1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://works.bepress.com/context/graydon_staring/article/1008/type/native/viewcontent/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://supreme.justia.com/us/454/235/case.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Some writers see the doctrine of FNC as having developed from an earlier doctrine of ''forum non competens'' ("non-competent forum"). Many early cases in the U.S. and Scotland involving FNC were cases under [[admiralty law]]. FNC thus may ultimately have a [[civilian law|civil law]] origin, as has been asserted by several writers, since admiralty law is based in civil law concepts.

The doctrine of FNC originated in the [[United States]] in ''Willendson v. Forsoket'' [29 Fed Cas 1283 (DC Pa 1801)] (No 17,682) where a federal district court in [[Pennsylvania]] declined to exercise jurisdiction over a [[Denmark|Danish]] sea captain who was being sued for back wages by a Danish seaman, stating that "[i]f any differences should hereafter arise, it must be settled by a Danish tribunal." In [[Scotland]], the concept is first recorded in ''MacMaster v. MacMaster'' (Judgment of 7 June 1833, Sess, Scot 11 Sess Cas, First Series 685.)

===United Kingdom===
The doctrine has limited application in most civil law jurisdictions which prefer ''[[lis alibi pendens]]'', although the principle behind FNC is acknowledged. As a member of the [[European Union]], the [[United Kingdom]] signed the [[Brussels Convention]]. The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act (1982) as amended by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act (1991) states:
{{quote|Nothing in this Act shall prevent any court in the UK from staying, sisting [staying or stopping a process, or summoning a party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/library/publications/docs/glossary.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209114651/http://scotcourts.gov.uk/library/publications/docs/glossary.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;], striking out or dismissing any proceedings before it on the ground of ''forum non conveniens'' or otherwise, where to do so is not inconsistent with the 1968 [Brussels] Convention or, as the case may be, the Lugano Convention.}}

The case of ''Owusu v Jackson and Others''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/EUECJ/2005/C28102.html&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[European Court of Justice]], was concerned with the relationship between Article 2 of the Brussels Convention and the scope of FNC within the [[European Community]]. In ''Owusu'', the English [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] asked the ECJ whether it could stay a matter brought to it under Article 2 Brussels Convention pursuant to the English FNC rules. The Court held that the Brussels Convention was a mandatory set of rules designed to harmonise and so produce a predictable system throughout the EU. If states were able to derogate from the Convention using their domestic rules of civil procedure, this would deny a uniform result to proceedings based on forum selection. Hence, at 46. the ECJ held:
{{quote|the Brussels Convention precludes a court of a Contracting State from declining the jurisdiction conferred on it by Article 2 of that convention on the ground that a court of a non-Contracting State would be a more appropriate forum for the trial of the action even if the jurisdiction of no other Contracting State is in issue or the proceedings have no connecting factors to any other Contracting State.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waltonsandmorse.com/Decisions2.jsp?decisionsID=9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, some UK commentators argue that the FNC rules may still apply to cases where the other proceedings are not in a Member state but this remains uncertain. What is certain is that a Scottish Court may sist its proceedings in favour of the Courts of England or Northern Ireland on the ground of FNC, since this is settling intra-UK jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Cumming v Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail Ltd, The Times June 8, 1995; Collins: 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In the jurisdictions where the FNC rule survives, a court will usually dismiss a case when the judge determines that the dispute would be better adjudicated in a different forum. Courts have been split in their applications of the rule. In ''Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co v Fay'' (1988) 165 CLR 197 and ''Voth v Manildra Flour Mills'' (1990) 171 CLR 538 the [[High Court of Australia]] refused to adopt the "most suitable forum" approach and instead devised its own "clearly inappropriate forum" test. Nevertheless, the Australian courts balanced the foreign and local factors, and a dismissal would only be granted if the defendant could show that he was "oppressed" or "harassed" by the plaintiff's choice of Australia for legal action. This retained the rationale of the traditional doctrine, making it impossible for Australian defendants to obtain a dismissal from their own courts on FNC grounds. In ''Regie National des Usines Renault SA v Zhang'' (2002) 210 CLR 491, the High Court affirmed the "clearly inappropriate forum" test as Australian law, while stating that even where the law of a foreign country had to be applied to decide a case, Australia would not be a "clearly inappropriate" forum for hearing the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Lindell: 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
However, with the advent of the Civil Procedure Act (2005), this common law position in Australia has changed.

===Canada===
The doctrine of FNC in Canada was considered in ''Amchem Products Inc. v. British Columbia Worker's Compensation Board'', [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897. The Court held that the test for striking out a claim for FNC is where "there is another forum that is clearly more appropriate than the domestic forum." If the forums are both found to be equally convenient, the domestic forum will always win out.

Convenience is weighed, using a multi-factored test that includes elements such as: the connection between the plaintiff's claim and the forum, the connection between the defendant and the forum, unfairness to the defendant by choosing the forum, unfairness to the plaintiff in not choosing the forum, involvement of other parties to the suit (i.e. location of witnesses), and issues of [[comity]] such as reciprocity and standard of adjudication.

The Supreme Court has underlined that FNC inquiries are similar to but distinct from the [[Real and substantial connection|Real and Substantial connection"]] test used in challenges to jurisdiction. The most important difference is that applying FNC is a discretionary choice between two forums, each of which could legally hear the issue.

The law of the province of Quebec, Canada is slightly different. The Quebec Civil Code 1994, at art. 3135 c.c.q., provides:
{{quote|Even though a Quebec authority has jurisdiction to hear a dispute, it may exceptionally and on an application by a party, decline jurisdiction if it considers that the authorities of another country are in a better position to decide.}}

The practical effects are identical to any other jurisdiction but the wording used by the code is different. For decisions applying art. 3135 c.c.q., see ''H.L. Boulton &amp; Co. S.C.C.A. v. Banque Royale du Canada'' (1995) R.J.Q. 213 (Quebec. Supr. Ct.); ''Lamborghini (Canada) Inc. v. Automobili Lamborghini S.P.A.'' (1997) R.J.Q. 58 (Quebec. C.A.); ''Spar Aerospace v. American Mobile Satellite'' (2002) 4 S.C.R. 205, and ''Grecon Dimter Inc. v. J.R. Normand Inc.'' (2004) R.J.Q. 88 (Quebec. C.A.)

===United States===
The defendant may move to dismiss an action on the ground of FNC. Invoking this doctrine usually means that the plaintiff properly invoked the jurisdiction of the court, but it is inconvenient for the court and the defendant to have a trial in the original jurisdiction. The court must balance convenience against the plaintiff’s choice of forum. In other words, if the plaintiff’s choice of forum was reasonable, the defendant must show a compelling reason to change jurisdiction. If a transfer would simply shift the inconvenience from one party to the other, the plaintiff’s choice of forum should not be disturbed.

Generally, a corporation sued in the jurisdiction of its headquarters is not entitled to seek an FNC dismissal. Thus if an [[United States|American]] corporation is sued in an area where it only transacts business but not where it has its headquarters, and the court dismisses based upon FNC, the plaintiff may refile the action in the jurisdiction of the corporation’s headquarters.

In deciding whether to grant the motion, the court considers:
* The location of potential [[witnesses]]. The defendant must make a full and candid showing, naming the potential witnesses for the defense, specifying their location, specifying what their testimony may be and how crucial it is for the defense, and setting forth how exactly they may be inconvenienced by having to testify in the court chosen by plaintiff.
* The location of [[relevance (law)|relevant]] [[evidence (law)|evidence]] and records. The defendant must identify the records; explain who is in charge of the records; address necessity, language, and translation problems; address the volume of such records; address the law governing these records; and rule out the existence of duplicate records in the jurisdiction chosen by the plaintiff. The mere fact that records need to be translated is not sufficient grounds to invoke FNC.
* Possible [[undue hardship]] for the [[defendant]]. The defendant must explain what the hardship is and how material the costs are. If there are costs involved, they need to be spelled out. If there is a difficulty in getting witnesses out of a foreign court and into the original court, this needs to be revealed to the court. The defendant must explain why the use of [[letters rogatory]] or other judicial reciprocity tools are not sufficient and cannot replace actual transfer of the case. The standard that the defendant must meet is “overwhelming hardship” if they are required to litigate in the forum’s State.
* Availability of adequate alternative forums for the plaintiff. Merely pointing out that the plaintiff could have sued somewhere else is not sufficient to succeed on an FNC motion.
* The expeditious use of [[judicial]] resources. In practice, this is just boilerplate language that comes along with the application. However, sometimes the court chosen by the plaintiff may be logistically or administratively unfit or ill‐equipped for the case; for example, a case may involve a large number of torts.
* The [[choice of law]] applicable to the dispute. If all other factors weigh in favor of keeping the case in the jurisdiction where it was filed, then the court may choose between application of local law (''lex fori'') or relevant foreign law. Thus, the mere fact that foreign law may apply to the event, circumstances, accident, or occurrence is not a strong reason to dismiss the case on FNC grounds.
* Questions of [[public policy (law)|public policy]]. In analyzing the factors, the subject matter of the complaint may touch on a sensitive issue that is important to the laws of either the original jurisdiction or the alternative forum. Those public policy issues must be pinpointed, analyzed and briefed in a way that makes it clear why this issue overrides the other factors. For example, an employee suing a foreign corporation in a state of employment, may enjoy the public policy to protect local employees from foreign abusers. See the [[Federal Employers Liability Act]] (FELA) for further reference.

Additional factors include:
* The location where the cause of action arose. In most states, defendant must usually show that the cause of action arose outside of the jurisdiction.
* The identities of the parties. Who is suing whom? Is the plaintiff suing an individual defendant or a small company without financial means as a method to oppress the defendant with financial and legal costs by litigating in a remote court? Is the defendant a conglomerate making the FNC application simply to force the plaintiff to bear expensive costs of travel and retainer of foreign lawyers? A plaintiff who is a resident in the state where action was filed is normally entitled to have his case heard in his home state.
* Vexatious motive. Where there is no evidence that the plaintiff had improper intent in bringing the case specifically in a particular forum, courts usually deny the FNC motion.
* Jurisprudential development and political conditions at the foreign forum. Is the court going to send the plaintiff to a land where the law is underdeveloped, uncivilized, or where there is no ''[[equal protection]]'' or ''[[due process]]''?  Is the court going to send the plaintiff to another court in a country where violence is rampant or in the middle of a war? A suit will not be dismissed if the foreign court does not permit litigation of the subject matter of the complaint, no live testimony of the plaintiff is required by appearance, or if the foreign law is otherwise deficient in its protocols or procedures.

The determination of the court may not be arbitrary or abusive as this is a drastic remedy to be applied with caution and restraint.

As for the transfer of a trial to a jurisdiction outside of the U.S., courts will only grant the transfer if a foreign court is “more appropriate”, and there may be a real opportunity to obtain justice there.

&lt;!-- The following section needs a rewrite for readability. I can’t even tell how some of the sentences are relevant or what cases that they apply to. --&gt;
In New York, for example, there is a strong presumption in favor of the plaintiff’s choice of forum. See Gulf Oil v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508 (1947); R. Maganlal &amp; Co., 942 F.2d 164, 167 (2nd Cir. 1991); Wiwa v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 226 F.3d 88, 101 (2d Cir. 2000); and Maran Coal Corp. V. Societe Generale de Surveillance S.A., No. 92 CIV 8728, 1993 US.Dist. LEXIS 12160 at *6 (S.D.N.Y. September 2, 1993). A defendant must show compelling evidence in order to disturb the choice of forum. The burden of proof is on the defendant: Strategic Value Master Fund, Ltd. v. Cargill Fin. Serv. Corp., 421 F.2d 741, 754 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). The court must also consider the defendant’s vast resources compared with the plaintiff’s limited resources as an aggrieved individual: See Wiwa at 107: “defendants have not demonstrated that these costs [of shipping documents and witnesses] are excessively burdensome, especially in view of defendant’s vast resources”. Also, Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., 244 F.Supp.2d 289 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) at 341: “A countervailing factor is the relative means of the parties”.
&lt;!-- This is the end of the section previously commented upon. --&gt;

In 2006, the 2nd Circuit Federal Court in New York issued a decision in the famous Coca-Cola case. Coca-Cola took over assets of Jews expelled from Egypt in the 1950s and was sued in New York. Bigio v. Coca-Cola Company, 448 F.3d 176 (2d Cir. 2006), ''certiorari'' to Sup. Ct. denied. In that case, the plaintiffs were Canadians and non‐residents of New York. The court denied Coca-Cola’s FNC motion and the U.S. Supreme Court denied ''certiorari''. The 2nd Circuit stated that the fact that the New York court would need to apply “modest application” of Egyptian law was not a problem because “courts of this Circuit are regularly called upon to interpret foreign law without thereby offending the principles of international comity”. Also, the fact that there were witnesses abroad was not a problem either. They could be flown into the U.S. or Letters Rogatory could be issued to the Egyptian courts to collect their testimony. Further, it was held that in an FNC scenario, a court applies the balance of conveniences, but preference (and weight) must be given to the fact that plaintiffs chose this particular forum for “legitimate reasons”. The fact that plaintiffs could sue in Canada was not relevant because Coca-Cola was a U.S. company and it was “perfectly reasonable to sue in the US”.

==Europe==
The doctrine of FNC gained little footing in the civil law world, which prefers the approach of ''[[lis alibi pendens]]'' (see Articles 21-23 Brussels Convention). The civil law jurisdictions generally base jurisdiction on the residence of the defendant and on [[choice of law]] rules favouring the [[habitual residence]] of the parties, the ''[[lex situs]]'', and the ''[[lex loci solutionis]]'' (applying ''actor sequitur forum rei''). This reflects an expectation that a defendant should be sued at his "own" courts, modified to reflect different priorities in certain types of case. As an example of this expectation, Article 2 [[Brussels I Regulation]] (as well as the corresponding Lugano conventions) provides:
{{quote|
Subject to the provisions of this Convention, persons domiciled in a Contracting State shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of that State.

Persons who are not nationals of the State in which they are domiciled shall be governed by the rules of jurisdiction applicable to nationals of that State.
}}

But this is subject to the substantial exceptions contained in Articles 3–6, the limitations on insurance actions in Articles 7–12, and consumer contracts in Articles 13–15. Article 16 also grants [[exclusive jurisdiction]] to specified jurisdictions as the ''lex situs'' of immovable property and a ''res'', and for the status of companies, the validity of public registers with particular reference to the registration and validity of patents, and the enforcement of judgments. Subsequent articles allow [[forum selection clause]]s and other forms of agreement between the parties to confer jurisdiction on a given forum. The Brussels Regime therefore represents a harmonised set of rules for the determination of all questions of jurisdiction throughout the EU and [[EFTA]] (but not Liechtenstein) excluding FNC.

==Shipping==
The issue of FNC arises in shipping cases since different parties may be involved as charterers or [[consignee]]s and because of the international nature of the [[Admiralty law|law of the sea]] and [[Maritime law|maritime]] trade. Despite several different [[Treaty|convention]]s dealing with aspects of international trade, jurisdictional disputes are common. Moreover, in some instances, a case in the [[United States]] may be initiated under U.S. state law when [[Admiralty law#United States|Admiralty law]] (which is a Federal jurisdiction) would be the more appropriate forum. If this occurs, the case may be removed to the Federal Courts or to the courts of another state on FNC grounds.

For example, suppose that a container ship comes into port in [[Miami, Florida]], United States. The ship, which is Liberian-registered, is wanted as security for various debts incurred by its Master while in [[Denmark]]. Made aware of the ship's presence, a local [[lawyer]] moves to impose a [[lien]] which involves a form of arrest by means of ''[[trial de novo|de novo]]'' proceedings ''in rem''. The local Federal district sitting in Admiralty determines that the ship's Master had ostensible authority as an [[agent (law)|agent]] to pledge the credit of the ship's owners (who are [[England|English]]). It also determines that neither the ship nor its owners have violated American law in any way, and the local court is not in a good position to hear witnesses who are all resident in other states. Further, major liability in [[demurrage]] to the innocent charterers, forwarders, etc. will be incurred if the ship is detained without just cause, so it would not be unreasonable for the Federal Court to decline jurisdiction. Whether there is subsequent litigation in another state will depend on the tactics of the creditors. Without a lien over the ship or the ability to obtain some form of control over the assets of the debtor, making a claim for money owing may not be cost-effective. But if there have already been proceedings on the issue of liability before a court of competent jurisdiction in another state so that the action in Miami is purely by way of [[enforcement of foreign judgments|enforcement]], the Miami jurisdiction, whether it be state or federal would be the ''forum conveniens'' because the ship is physically within the jurisdiction.

[[File:Frank Francisco on April 5, 2012.jpg|thumb|Francisco with the New York Mets]]
'''Franklin Thomas Francisco''' (born September 11, 1979) is a [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] former professional [[baseball]] [[pitcher]]. He played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Toronto Blue Jays]], [[New York Mets]] and [[Chicago White Sox]].

==Baseball career==
Francisco was originally signed as an amateur [[free agent]] by the [[Boston Red Sox]]. He was traded by the Red Sox to the [[Chicago White Sox]] on July 31, {{mlby|2002}}, along with Byeong Hak An, in exchange for reliever [[Bob Howry]]. On July 1, {{mlby|2003}}, the White Sox acquired [[Carl Everett]] from the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in exchange for three players to be named later.

===Texas Rangers===
On July 25, 2003, Francisco, [[Josh Rupe]], and minor leaguer Anthony Webster were sent to the Rangers to complete the trade.

Francisco is best known for participating in a notable incident involving [[List of violent spectator incidents in sports|fan violence]]. On September 13, {{mlby|2004}}, he threw a folding chair into the crowd during a game against the [[Oakland Athletics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/story/7680194 Rangers' Francisco arrested for hitting fans with thrown chair] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217215057/http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/story/7680194 |date=2004-12-17 }}, [[CBS]]. Published September 14, 2004. Retrieved October 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident initially escalated when Rangers pitcher [[Doug Brocail]] confronted a fan. Francisco, who was in the dugout when all this was happening in the bullpen, ran from the dugout to the bullpen and threw a folding chair into the crowd, hitting a female fan in the face, breaking her nose and causing a cut which required stitches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=esterbook|first1=john|title=Chair-Throwing Pitcher Suspended|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/chair-throwing-pitcher-suspended/|website=cbs news|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francisco was arrested and on June 30, 2005, he pleaded [[nolo contendere|no contest]] to the charges. He was sentenced to anger management classes and a work program. A civil suit brought by the woman who had been struck by the chair was settled on January 12, 2007. Terms of the settlement included an undisclosed payment and a public apology.

Francisco was suspended for the balance of the 2004 season, and missed the entire {{mlby|2005}} season after undergoing [[Tommy John surgery]]. Francisco rejoined the club on September 8, {{mlby|2006}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, T.R. [http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060908&amp;content_id=1652541&amp;vkey=news_tex&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tex Notes: Francisco excited to be back], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. Published September 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a poor [[spring training]], Francisco started {{mlby|2007}} with the Rangers' Triple-A affiliate, the [[Oklahoma RedHawks]]. Following an injury to [[Éric Gagné]] in mid-April, Francisco was recalled to the majors. Francisco spent time in {{mlby|2008}} as the Rangers' [[Closer (baseball)|closer]] after an injury to regular closer [[C. J. Wilson (baseball)|C. J. Wilson]].

Francisco again began {{mlby|2009}} as the closer. He began with seven scoreless innings, allowing three hits and one walk, while garnering two saves.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, David. [http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090421&amp;content_id=4357152&amp;vkey=news_tex&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tex Francisco solidifying role as closer], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. Published April 22, 2009. Retrieved April 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the end of April, Francisco maintained a 0.00 ERA with one walk and nine strikeouts, as well as six saves.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, T.R. [http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090428&amp;content_id=4467092&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tex Francisco seals Rangers' scrappy win], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. Published April 29, 2009. Retrieved May 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He allowed his first run of 2009 on an upper-deck home run by Oakland Athletics' second baseman, [[Adam Kennedy]].

Francisco and the Rangers agreed to a one-year contract of $3.265 million, thereby avoiding arbitration for the 2010 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trsullivan.mlblogs.com/archives/2010/01/francisco_agrees_to_contract.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130201949/http://trsullivan.mlblogs.com/archives/2010/01/francisco_agrees_to_contract.html |archivedate=2010-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisco lost the closer's role after blowing saves in his first two chances of the [[2010 Texas Rangers season|2010 baseball season]].

===Toronto Blue Jays===
On January 25, 2011, Francisco was traded to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in exchange for catcher [[Mike Napoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110125&amp;content_id=16499196&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=tw_article_16499196|title=Napoli dealt to Rangers for Francisco|accessdate=2011-01-25|last=Stephens|first=Bailey|date=2011-01-25|publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, Francisco agreed to terms with the Blue Jays on a one-year contract. After a stint on the disabled list, Francisco made his debut as a Blue Jay on April 20. On his first pitch as a Blue Jay, Francisco gave up a home run to the Yankees' [[Curtis Granderson]].

===New York Mets===
On December 6, 2011, Francisco agreed to a two-year contract worth $12 million with the [[New York Mets]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22297882/33737135&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Francisco made his Mets debut on April 5, 2012 against the [[Atlanta Braves]], and was named the Mets' closer for the 2012 season.

On May 13, 2012, Francisco was ejected from a game against the [[Miami Marlins]] at [[Marlins Park]] after an outburst towards the home plate umpire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-mets-bullpen-implodes-8-4-loss-miami-marlins-giancarlo-stanton-hits-grand-slam-9th-inning-article-1.1077411&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2012, after a save against the [[New York Yankees]], Francisco was placed on the 15-day disabled list after feeling soreness in his oblique muscle. Before he began a rehabilitation assignment to come off the DL, Francisco aggravated his injury. On August 22, 2012, Francisco showed frustration by hurling a cooler in the dugout after giving up two runs in the top of the ninth inning. On December 18, 2012, Francisco had surgery to remove a bone spur from his right elbow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=[[The Newark Star Ledger]] December 19, 2012. pg. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 2013, Francisco was moved to the 60-day disabled list to make room on the 40-man roster for [[shortstop]] [[Omar Quintanilla]].

===Chicago White Sox===
On April 14, 2014, the White Sox signed Francisco to a minor league contract, and assigned him to the Triple-A [[Charlotte Knights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Padilla|first=Doug|title=White Sox pick up Frank Francisco|url=http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/10782631/chicago-white-sox-sign-right-hander-frank-francisco|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=April 14, 2014|date=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 17, when [[Frank De Los Santos]] was transferred from the [[Birmingham Barons]], Francisco was transferred to the Rookie [[Pioneer League (baseball)|Pioneer League]] team, the [[Great Falls Voyagers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knights|first=Charlotte|url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20140417&amp;content_id=72415714&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;vkey=news_t494&amp;sid=t494|accessdate=April 17, 2014|date=April 17, 2014 |title=Putnam to Chicago, De Los Santos to Charlotte}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10, the White Sox purchased his contract from Charlotte and brought him up to the major leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theprovince.com/sports/White+bring+Frank+Francisco/9827324/story.html |title=White Sox bring up Frank Francisco |date=May 10, 2014 |accessdate=May 11, 2014 |work=The Province}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was designated for assignment on May 22, 2014.  He cleared waivers and was assigned outright to Charlotte on May 24. Francisco refused the assignment and became a free agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2014/05/frank-francisco-elects-free-agency.html |title=Frank Francisco Elects Free Agency |first=Zach |last=Links |date=May 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 25, 2014 |work=MLB Trade Rumors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Stint with Toronto===
Francisco signed a minor league deal in late June with Toronto but was released on July 14, 2014, after not appearing in a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2014/07/minor-moves-francisco-gimenez.html|title=Minor Moves: Francisco, Gimenez|last=Polishuk|first=Mark|work=mlbtraderumors.com|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks grew up in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], the son of F. L. Banks Sr. and Violet Mabery Banks, and graduated from [[Lanier High School (Jackson, Mississippi)|Lanier High School]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="MC Law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judicial.mc.edu/judge_profiles.php#banks|title=Profiles of Former Justices and Judges: Fred L. Banks Jr.|publisher=
Mississippi College Judicial Data Project|date=December 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[B.B.A.]] from [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], followed by a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from the [[Howard University School of Law]], in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;Turry Flucker, Phoenix Savage, ''African Americans of Jackson'' (2008), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt; where he graduated ''cum laude'', second in his class.&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MC Law"/&gt; Banks "chose to enter the law to help African Americans achieve equality", being one of only a handful of African American attorneys in the state at the time of his graduation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Finkelman, ''Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present'' (2009), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining [[admission to the bar]] in Mississippi, he entered into private practice in Jackson with several other attorneys acting as local counsel for the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund]].&lt;ref name="MC Law"/&gt; He then formed a law firm with several of those attorneys, [[Reuben Anderson]], E.M. Nichols, and [[Melvyn R. Leventhal]].&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt;

==Career==
===Legislative service===
In 1975, Banks was elected to represent [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]] in the [[Mississippi House of Representatives]]. He was twice re-elected.&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt; During his time in the House, Banks chaired the House Ethics Committee, the House Judiciary Committee, and the Legislative Black Caucus.&lt;ref name="MBJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msbusiness.com/2013/05/banks-wins-award/|title=Fred Banks wins Inns of Court award|publisher=''[[Mississippi Business Journal]]''|date=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt; Banks, along with Representatives [[Horace L. Buckley]] and [[Douglas L. Anderson]], also from Jackson, fought to preserve records from the pro-segregation [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]], in opposition to a bill which would authorize the destruction of these records.&lt;ref&gt;Yasuhiro Katagiri, ''The Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission: Civil Rights and States' Rights'' (2007), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Also during this period, on September 24, 1979, President [[Jimmy Carter]] announced his appointment of Banks as one of nine members of the National Advisory Council on the Education of Disadvantaged Children.&lt;ref&gt;''Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States, Jimmy Carter, 1979'' (1980), p. 1727.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial service===
During this time, Reuben Anderson had been appointed to a seat as a Circuit Judge for the 7th Circuit District, encompassing Hinds County and [[Yazoo County, Mississippi|Yazoo]]. Banks served in the legislature until February 1985, when Anderson was Governor [[William Allain]], having elevated Reuben Anderson to the Mississippi Supreme Court, appointed Banks to Anderson's seat on the 7th Circuit District.&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt; Banks was twice re-elected without opposition.&lt;ref name="MC Law"/&gt; In January 1991, following Anderson's resignation from the Mississippi Supreme Court, Governor [[Ray Mabus]] appointed Banks to fill the remainder of Anderson's term. Banks was elected to serve the remainder of that term in November 1991 and re-elected to a full term in November 1996.&lt;ref name="MC Law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt;

In 1993, Banks was mentioned as a potential nominee to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], during the administration of President [[Bill Clinton]], as there were no African American judges on the Fifth Circuit.&lt;ref&gt;"Clinton and the Federal Courts", ''[[Black Enterprise]]'' (April 1993), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton ultimately appointed Louisiana state court judge [[Carl E. Stewart]] as the first African American judge on the Fifth Circuit.

Banks retired from the court in 2001, and thereafter became a senior partner at the law firm of Phelps Dunbar.&lt;ref name="MBJ"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6379">In the branch of mathematics called [[category theory]], a '''hopfian object''' is an object ''A'' such that any [[epimorphism]] of ''A'' onto ''A'' is necessarily an [[automorphism]].  The [[duality (mathematics)|dual notion]] is that of a '''cohopfian object''', which is an object ''B'' such that every [[monomorphism]] from ''B'' into ''B'' is necessarily an automorphism.  The two conditions have been studied in the categories of [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[module (mathematics)|module]]s, and [[topological spaces]].

The terms "hopfian" and "cohopfian" have arisen since the 1960s, and are said to be in honor of [[Heinz Hopf]] and his use of the concept of the hopfian group in his work on [[fundamental group]]s of surfaces. {{harv|Hazewinkel|2001|p=63}}

==Properties==
Both conditions may be viewed as types of [[finiteness condition]]s in their category.  For example, assuming [[ZFC|Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice]] and working in the [[category of sets]], the hopfian and cohopfian objects are precisely the [[finite set#Necessary and sufficient conditions for finiteness|finite set]]s.  From this it is easy to see that all finite groups, finite modules and finite rings are hopfian and cohopfian in their categories.

Hopfian objects and cohopfian objects have an elementary interaction with [[projective object]]s and [[injective object]]s.  The two results are:
*An injective hopfian object is cohopfian.
*A projective cohopfian object is hopfian.
The proof for the first statement is short: Let ''A'' be and injective hopfian object, and let ''f'' be an injective morphism from ''A'' to ''A''.  By injectivity, ''f'' factors through the identity map ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''A'', yielding a morphism ''g'' such that ''gf''=''I''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;.  As a result, ''g'' is a surjective morphism and hence an automorphism, and then ''f'' is necessarily the inverse automorphism to ''g''.  This proof can be dualized to prove the second statement.

==Hopfian and cohopfian groups==
{{main|hopfian group}}

==Hopfian and cohopfian modules==
Here are several basic results in the category of modules.  It is especially important to remember that ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; being hopfian or cohopfian as a module is different from ''R'' being hopfian or cohopfian as a ring.

* A [[Noetherian module]] is hopfian, and an [[Artinian module]] is cohopfian.
* The module ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; is hopfian if and only if ''R'' is a [[directly finite ring]].  Symmetrically, these two are also equivalent to the module &lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' being hopfian.
* In contrast with the above, the modules ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; or &lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' can be cohopfian or not in any combination.  An example of a ring cohopfian on one side but not the other side was given in {{harv|Varadarajan|1992}}.  However, if either of these two modules is cohopfian, ''R'' is hopfian on both sides (since ''R'' is projective as a left or right module) and directly finite.

==Hopfian and cohopfian rings==
The situation in the category of rings is quite different from the category of modules.  The reader should note that the morphisms in the category of rings with unity are required to preserve the identity, that is, to send 1 to 1.

* If ''R'' satisfies the [[ascending chain condition]] on ideals, then ''R'' is hopfian.  This can be proven by analogy with the fact for Noetherian modules.  The counterpart idea for "cohopfian" does not exist however, since if ''f'' is a ring homomorphism from ''R'' into ''R'' preserving identity, and the image of ''f'' is not ''R'', then the image is certainly not an ideal of ''R''.  In any case, this shows that a one sided Noetherian or Artinian ring is always hopfian.
* Any simple ring is hopfian, since the kernel of any endomorphism is an ideal, which is necessarily zero in a simple ring.  In contrast, in {{harv|Varadarajan|1992}}, and example of a non-cohopfian [[field (mathematics)|field]] was given.  
* The [[full linear ring]] End&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;(V) of a countable dimensional vector space is a hopfian ring which is not hopfian as a module, since it only has three ideals, but it is not directly finite.  The paper {{harv|Varadarajan|1992}} also gives an example of a cohopfian ring which is not cohopfian as a module.
* Also in {{harv|Varadarajan|1992}}, it is shown that for a [[Boolean ring]] ''R'' and its associated [[stone space#Stone spaces|Stone space]] ''X'', the ring ''R'' is hopfian in the category of rings if and only if ''X'' is cohopfian in the category of topological spaces, and ''R'' is cohopfian as a ring if and only if ''X'' is hopfian as a topological space.

== Hopfian and cohopfian topological spaces ==
* In {{harv|Varadarajan|1992}}, a series of results on compact manifolds are included.  Firstly, the only [[compact manifold]]s which are hopfian are finite [[discrete space]]s. Secondly, compact manifolds without boundary are always cohopfian.  Lastly, compact manifolds with nonempty boundary are not cohopfian.

An '''imagined community''' is a concept developed by [[Benedict Anderson]] in his 1983 book ''[[Imagined Communities]]'', to analyze [[nationalism]]. Anderson depicts a [[nation]] as a socially constructed community, imagined by the people who perceive themselves as part of that group.&lt;ref name="ic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Imagined communities: reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism |last=Anderson |first=Benedict R. O'G. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Verso |location=London |isbn=978-0-86091-546-1
 |pages=6–7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4mmoZFtCpuoC |edition=Revised and extended.|accessdate= 5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6–7}}

The [[mass media|media]] also creates imagined communities, through usually targeting a mass audience or generalizing and addressing citizens as the public. Another way that the media can create imagined communities is through the use of images. The media can perpetuate stereotypes through certain images and vernacular. By showing certain images, the audience will choose which image they relate to the most, furthering the relationship to that imagined community.

==Origin==
According to Anderson, creation of imagined communities became possible because of "[[print capitalism]]".&lt;ref name=nationalismproject&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalismproject.org/books/a_b.htm|title=The Nationalism Project: Books by Author A-B|work=nationalismproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capitalist entrepreneurs printed their books and media in the [[vernacular]] (instead of exclusive script languages, such as [[Latin]]) in order to maximize circulation. As a result, readers speaking various local dialects became able to understand each other, and a common discourse emerged. Anderson argued that the first European nation-states were thus formed around their "national print-languages."

==Nationalism and imagined communities==
According to Anderson's theory of imagined communities, the main causes of nationalism are the declining importance of privileged access to particular script languages (such as [[Latin]]) because of mass vernacular literacy;{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} the movement to abolish the ideas of rule by divine right and hereditary monarchy;{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} and the emergence of printing press capitalism ("the convergence of capitalism and print technology... standardization of national calendars, clocks and language was embodied in books and the publication of daily newspapers")&lt;ref name=nationalismproject/&gt;—all phenomena occurring with the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=nationalismproject/&gt;

While attempting to define nationalism, Anderson identifies three paradoxes:

"(1) The objective modernity of nations to the historians' eyes vs. their subjective antiquity in the eyes of nationalists. (2) The formal universality of nationality as a socio-cultural concept [and] (3) the 'political' power of such nationalisms vs. their philosophical poverty and even incoherence."&lt;ref name="ic" /&gt;

Anderson talks of Unknown Soldier tombs as an example of nationalism. The tombs of Unknown Soldiers are either empty or hold unidentified remains, but each nation with these kinds of memorials claim these soldiers as their own. No matter what the actual origin of the Unknown Soldier is, these nations have placed them within their own imagined community.&lt;ref name="ic" /&gt;

==Nation as an imagined community==
He defined a nation as "an imagined political community".&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt; As Anderson puts it, a nation "is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion".&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt; Members of the community probably will never know each of the other members face to face; however, they may have similar interests or identify as part of the same nation. Members hold in their minds a mental image of their affinity: for example, the nationhood felt with other members of your nation when your "imagined community" participates in a larger event such as the [[Olympic Games]].

Finally, a nation is a [[community]] because,{{quote|regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship. Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings.&lt;ref name="ic"/&gt;}}

==Context and influence==
Benedict Anderson arrived at his theory because he felt that neither [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist]] nor liberal theory adequately explained nationalism.

Anderson falls into the "[[historicist]]" or "[[modernist]]" school of [[nationalism]] along with [[Ernest Gellner]] and [[Eric Hobsbawm]] in that he posits that nations and nationalism are products of [[modernity]] and have been created as means to political and economic ends. This school stands in opposition to the [[primordialists]], who believe that nations, if not nationalism, have existed since early human history. Imagined communities can be seen as a form of [[social constructionism]] on a par with [[Edward Said|Edward Said's]] concept of [[imagined geographies]].

In contrast to Gellner and Hobsbawm, Anderson is not hostile to the idea of nationalism nor does he think that nationalism is obsolete in a globalizing world. Anderson values the utopian element in nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161125065519/https://www.uio.no/english/research/interfaculty-research-areas/culcom/news/2005/anderson.html Interview with Benedict Anderson by Lorenz Khazaleh], University of Oslo website&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Harald Bauder, the concept of imagined communities remains highly relevant in a contemporary context of how nation-states frame and formulate their identities in relation to domestic and foreign policy, such as policies towards immigrants and migration.&lt;ref&gt;Bauder, H. (2011) Immigration Dialectic: Imagining Community, Economy and Nation. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. {{page needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Euan Hague, "Anderson's concept of nations being 'imagined communities' has become standard within books reviewing geographical thought".&lt;ref name=sage&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/9613_020037ch1and2.pdf|title=Benedict Anderson|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the term was coined to specifically describe nationalism, it is now used more broadly, almost blurring it with [[community of interest]]. For instance, it can be used to refer to a community based on sexual orientation,&lt;ref&gt;Ross, C. (2012). Imagined communities: initiatives around LGBTQ ageing in Italy. ''Modern Italy'', 17(4), 449-464. doi:10.1080/13532944.2012.706997&lt;/ref&gt; or awareness of global risk factors.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, U 2011, "Cosmopolitanism as Imagined Communities of Global Risk", ''American Behavioral Scientist'', 55, 10, pp. 1346-1361, Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost, viewed 2 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more footnotes|date=March 2018}}
'''Info-metrics''' is an interdisciplinary approach to [[scientific modeling]], [[inference]] and efficient [[information processing]]. It is the science of modeling, reasoning, and drawing inferences under conditions of noisy and limited information. From the point of view of the sciences, this framework is at the intersection of [[information theory]], [[statistical method]]s of inference, [[applied mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[econometrics]], [[Complexity|complexity theory]], [[decision analysis]], modeling, and the [[philosophy of science]].

Info-metrics provides a [[constrained optimization]]  framework to tackle under-determined or ill-posed problems – problems where there is not sufficient information for finding a unique solution. Such problems are very common across all sciences: available information is [[Incomplete information|incomplete]], limited, [[Noise (signal processing)|noisy]]  and [[Uncertainty|uncertain]]. Info-metrics is useful for [[scientific modelling|modelling]] , [[information processing]] , [[theory]] building, and [[inference]] problems across the scientific spectrum. The info-metrics framework can also be used to test hypotheses about competing theories or [[Causality|causal mechanisms]].

== History ==

Info-metrics evolved from the classical [[Principle of maximum entropy|maximum entropy]]  formalism, which is based on the work of [[Claude Shannon|Shannon]]. Early contributions were mostly in the natural and mathematical/statistical sciences. Since the mid 1980s and especially in the mid 1990s the maximum entropy approach was generalized and extended to handle a larger class of problems in the social and behavioral sciences, especially for complex problems and data. The word ‘info-metrics’ was coined in 2009 by Amos Golan, right before the interdisciplinary Info-Metrics Institute was inaugurated.

== Preliminary definitions ==

Consider a [[random variable]]  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that can result in one of ''K'' distinct outcomes. The [[probability]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt; p_k &lt;/math&gt; of each outcome &lt;math display="inline"&gt; x_k &lt;/math&gt;  is &lt;math display="inline"&gt; p_k = p(x_k) &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math display="inline"&gt; k=1,2,\ldots,K&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a ''K''-dimensional probability distribution defined for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math "display=inline"&gt; p_k \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \sum_k p_k = 1 &lt;/math&gt;. Define the informational content of a single outcome  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt;  to be &lt;math display="inline"&gt; h(x_k) = h(p_k) = \log_2(1/p_k)&lt;/math&gt;  (e.g., Shannon). Observing an outcome at the tails of the distribution (a rare event) provides much more information than observing another, more probable, outcome. The entropy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shannon|first1=Claude|title=A mathematical theory of communication|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|date=1948|volume=27|pages=379–423}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the expected information content of an outcome of the random variable ''X'' whose probability distribution is ''P'':
&lt;math display="block"&gt;
H(P) = \sum_{k=1}^K p_k \log_2 \left(\frac 1 {p_k}\right) = - \sum_{k=1}^K p_k \log_2(p_k) = \operatorname E\left [\log_2 \left (\frac 1 {P(X)} \right )\right ]
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math mode="inline"&gt;p_k \log_2(p_k) \equiv 0 &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math mode=inline&gt; p_k = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math mode="inline"&gt;\operatorname E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Expected value|expectation]] operator.

== The basic info-metrics problem ==

Consider the problem of modeling and inferring the unobserved probability distribution of some ''K''-dimensional discrete random variable given just the mean (expected value) of that variable. We also know that the probabilities are nonnegative and normalized (i.e., sum up to exactly 1). For all ''K''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2 the problem is underdetermined. Within the info-metrics framework, the solution is to maximize the entropy of the random variable subject to the two constraints: mean and normalization. This yields the usual maximum entropy solution. The solutions to that problem can be extended and generalized in several ways. First, one can use another entropy instead of Shannon’s entropy. Second, the same approach can be used for continuous random variables, for all types of conditional models (e.g., regression, inequality and nonlinear models), and for many constraints. Third, priors can be incorporated within that framework. Fourth, the same framework can be extended to accommodate greater uncertainty: uncertainty about the observed values and/or uncertainty about the model itself. Last, the same basic framework can be used to develop new models/theories, validate these models using all available information, and test statistical hypotheses about the model.

== Examples ==

=== Six-sided dice ===

''Inference based on information resulting from repeated independent experiments.''

The following example is attributed to [[L. Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] and was further popularized by [[ET Jaynes|Jaynes]]. Consider a six-sided {{dice}}, where tossing the {{dice}} is the event and the distinct outcomes are the numbers 1 through 6 on the upper face of the {{dice}}. The experiment is the independent repetitions of tossing the same {{dice}}.
Suppose you only observe the empirical mean value, y, of N tosses of a six-sided {{dice}}. Given that information, you want to infer the probabilities that a specific value of the face will show up in the next toss of the {{dice}}. You also know that the sum of the probabilities must be 1. Maximizing the entropy (and using log base 2) subject to these two constraints (mean and normalization) yields the most uninformed solution.
&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \underset{\{P\}}{\text{maximize}}
&amp; &amp; H(\mathbf{p}) = -\sum_{k=1}^6 p_k \log_2(p_k) \\
&amp; \text{subject to}
&amp; &amp; \sum_k p_k x_k = y \text{ and } \sum_k p_k = 1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

for  &lt;math display="inline"&gt; x_k = k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k=1,2,\ldots,6&lt;/math&gt; . The solution is

: &lt;math display="block"&gt;
\widehat{p}_k = \frac{2^{-\widehat{\lambda} x_k}}{\sum_{k=1}^6 2^{-\widehat{\lambda} x_k}} \equiv \frac{2^{-\lambda x_k}} \Omega
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\widehat{p}_k&lt;/math&gt;  is the inferred probability of event &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \widehat{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is the inferred Lagrange multipliers associated with the mean constraint, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition]] (normalization) function. If it’s a fair {{dice}} with mean of 3.5 you would expect that all faces are equally likely and the probabilities are equal. This is what the maximum entropy solution gives. If the {{dice}} is unfair (or loaded) with a mean of 4, the resulting maximum entropy solution will be &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p_k=(0.103,  0.123, 0.146,  0.174,  0.207, 0.247)&lt;/math&gt;. For comparison, minimizing the least squares criterion &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left(\sum_{k=1}^6 p_k^2\right)&lt;/math&gt; instead of maximizing the entropy yields &lt;math display="inline"&gt; p_k(LS) =(0.095,  0.124,  0.152,  0.181, 0.210, 0.238)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Some cross-disciplinary examples ===

''Rainfall prediction'': Using the expected daily rainfall (arithmetic mean), the maximum entropy framework can be used to infer and forecast the daily rainfall distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Golan|first1=Amos|title=Foundations of Info-metrics: Modeling, Inference, and Imperfect Information|date=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Portfolio management'': Suppose there is a portfolio manager who needs to allocate some assets or assign portfolio weights to different assets, while taking into account the investor’s constraints and preferences. Using these preferences and constraints, as well as the observed information, such as the market mean return, and covariances, of each asset over some time period, the entropy maximization framework can be used to find the optimal portfolio weights. In this case, the entropy of the portfolio represents its diversity. This framework can be modified to include other constraints such as minimal variance, maximal diversity etc. That model involves inequalities and can be further generalized to include short sales. More such examples and related code can be found on &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bera|first1=Anil K.|last2=Park|first2=Sung Y.|title=Optimal portfolio diversification using the maximum entropy principle|journal=Econometric Reviews|date=2008|volume=27|issue=4-6|pages=484–512}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portfolio Allocation – Foundations of Info-Metrics|url=http://info-metrics.org/interact/portfolio.html|website=info-metrics.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], an '''initial algebra''' is an [[initial object]] in the [[F-algebra|category of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebras]] for a given [[endofunctor]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. This initiality provides a general framework for [[mathematical induction|induction]] and [[recursion]]. 

For instance, consider the endofunctor &lt;math&gt;1+(-)&lt;/math&gt; on the category of sets, where &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is the one-point (singleton) set, the terminal object in the category. An algebra for this endofunctor is a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (called the ''carrier'' of the algebra) together with a point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and a function &lt;math&gt;X\to X&lt;/math&gt;. The set of [[natural number]]s is the carrier of the initial such algebra: the point is zero and the function is the successor map. 

For a second example, consider the endofunctor &lt;math&gt;1+\mathbf{N}\times(-)&lt;/math&gt; on the category of sets, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of natural numbers. An algebra for this endofunctor is a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/Math&gt; together with a point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and a function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}\times X\to X&lt;/math&gt;. The set of finite [[List (computing)|list]]s of natural numbers is the initial such algebra. The point is the empty list, and the function is [[cons]], taking a number and a finite list, and returning a new finite list with the number at the head.

In categories with binary coproducts, the definitions just given are equivalent to the usual definitions of a [[natural number object]] and a [[list object]], respectively.

==Final coalgebra==
Dually, a '''final coalgebra''' is a [[terminal object]] in the [[F-coalgebra|category of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-coalgebras]]. The finality provides a general framework for [[coinduction]] and [[corecursion]].

For example, using the same functor &lt;math&gt;1+(-)&lt;/math&gt; as before, a coalgebra is a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; together with a [[truth-value]]d test function &lt;math&gt;p\colon X \to 2&lt;/math&gt; and a [[partial function]] &lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to X&lt;/math&gt; whose [[Domain of a function|domain]] is formed by those &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;p(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N} \cup \{\omega\}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of the natural numbers extended with a new element &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the carrier of the final coalgebra in the category, where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the test for zero: &lt;math&gt;p(0)=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p(n+1) = p(\omega) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the predecessor function (the [[Inverse function|inverse]] of the successor function) on the positive naturals, but acts like the [[Identity function|identity]] on the new element &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;f(n+1) = n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(\omega) = \omega&lt;/math&gt;. This set &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N} \cup \{\omega\}&lt;/math&gt; that is the carrier of the final coalgebra of &lt;math&gt;1+(-)&lt;/math&gt; is known as the set of [[conatural numbers]].

For a second example, consider the same functor &lt;math&gt;1 + \mathbf{N}\times(\mathord{-})&lt;/math&gt; as before. In this case the carrier of the final coalgebra consists of all lists of natural numbers, finite as well as [[Infinite list|infinite]]. The operations are a test function testing whether a list is empty, and a deconstruction function defined on nonempty lists returning a pair consisting of the head and the tail of the input list.

== Theorems ==
* Initial algebras are minimal (i.e., have no proper subalgebra).
* Final coalgebras are [[Simple algebra|simple]] (i.e., have no proper quotients).

== Example ==

Consider the endofunctor &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; sending &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1+X&lt;/math&gt;. Define
:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  \operatorname{zero} \colon 1 &amp;\longrightarrow\mathbf{N} \\
  * &amp;\longmapsto 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt; 
and
:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  \operatorname{succ}\colon \mathbf{N}&amp;\longrightarrow\mathbf{N} \\
  n &amp;\longmapsto n + 1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Then the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; of [[natural number]]s together with the function &lt;math&gt;[\operatorname{zero},\operatorname{succ}]\colon 1+\mathbf{N} \to \mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; is an initial &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra. The initiality (the [[universal property]] for this case) is not hard to establish; the unique [[homomorphism]] to an arbitrary &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra &lt;math&gt;(A, [e,f])&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;e\colon 1 \to A&lt;/math&gt; an element of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f\colon A \to A&lt;/math&gt; a [[function (mathematics)|function]] on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, is the function sending the natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;f^n(e)&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;f(f(\dots(f(e))\dots))&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-fold application of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;.

== Use in computer science ==

Various finite [[data structures]] used in [[Mathematical programming|programming]], such as [[List (computing)|list]]s and [[tree]]s, can be obtained as initial algebras of specific endofunctors.
While there may be several initial algebras for a given endofunctor, they are [[unique (mathematics)|unique]] [[up to]] [[isomorphism]], which informally means that the "observable" properties of a data structure can be adequately captured by defining it as an initial algebra.

To obtain the [[datatype|type]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{List}(A)&lt;/math&gt; of lists whose elements are members of set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, consider that the list-forming operations are:

*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nil}\colon 1 \to \mathrm{List}(A)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cons}\colon A \times \mathrm{List}(A) \to \mathrm{List}(A)&lt;/math&gt;

Combined into one function, they give:

*&lt;math&gt;[\mathrm{nil},\mathrm{cons}]\colon (1 + A \times \mathrm{List}(A))\to \mathrm{List}(A)&lt;/math&gt;,

which makes this an &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra for the endofunctor &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; sending &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1+(A\times X)&lt;/math&gt;. It is, in fact, ''the'' initial &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra. Initiality is established by the function known as ''[[Fold (higher-order function)|foldr]]'' in [[functional programming|functional]] [[programming language]]s such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[ML programming language|ML]].

Likewise, [[binary tree]]s with elements at the leaves can be obtained as the initial algebra

*&lt;math&gt;[\mathrm{tip},\mathrm{join}]\colon A + (\mathrm{Tree}(A) \times \mathrm{Tree}(A)) \to \mathrm{Tree}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Types obtained this way are known as [[algebraic data type]]s.

Types defined by using [[least fixed point]] construct with functor &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as an initial [[F-algebra|&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra]], provided that [[parametricity]] holds for the type.&lt;ref name=free-rectypes&gt;Philip Wadler: [http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/free-rectypes/free-rectypes.txt Recursive types for free!] University of Glasgow, July 1998. Draft.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] way, similar relationship exists between notions of [[greatest fixed point]] and terminal [[F-coalgebra]], with applications to [[coinductive]] types.  These can be used for allowing [[Actual infinity|potentially infinite]] objects while maintaining [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strong normalization property]].&lt;ref name=free-rectypes/&gt; In the strongly normalizing [[Charity (programming language)|Charity]] programming language (i.e. each program terminates), coinductive data types can be used achieving surprising results, e.g. defining [[Lookup table|lookup]] constructs to implement such [[Computability theory (computer science)|“strong”]] functions like the [[Ackermann function]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cockett: Charitable Thoughts ([ftp://ftp.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/pub/projects/charity/literature/papers_and_reports/charitable.ps ps]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [ftp://ftp.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/pub/projects/charity/literature/papers_and_reports/charitable.ps.gz ps.gz]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}})&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5929">'''Interdiscourse''' is the implicit or explicit relations that a [[discourse]] has to other discourses. '''Interdiscursivity''' is the aspect of a discourse that relates it to other discourses. [[Norman Fairclough]] prefers the concept "orders of discourse". Interdiscursivity is often mostly an analytic concept, e.g. in Foucault and Fairclough. Interdiscursivity has close affinity to [[recontextualisation]] because interdiscourse often implies that elements are imported from another discourse.

The meaning of interdiscourse varies. It denotes at least three levels:

# In Courtine interdiscursivity means that ''a discourse has a relation to another discourse''. That is, a meaning which is close to the meaning of [[intertextuality]].
# In [[Norman Fairclough]] and Linell interdiscursive denotes ''relations between types of discourse'' such as genres.
# In [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Marc Angenot]], interdiscursive &lt;ref&gt;constellation/configuration interdiscursive, Foucault 1969: 88, 206-8&lt;/ref&gt; denotes ''relations between discursive formations'', that is, between large heterogeneous discursive entities, such as natural history and political economy during enlightenment. In [[Michel Foucault]], interdiscourse is differences and equalities across [[discourse|discursive formations]].

An example (where 1. corresponds to a., etc.) illustrates the three levels: A minister of environment speaks in the parliament about a proposal.

*a. She refers to other specific speeches in the parliament about the proposal.
*b. She refers to a memorandum from her civil servants.
*c. She refers to scientific reports supporting the proposal.

The example illustrates that 2. and 3. are specific cases of 1, in the sense a-c all relate to another discourse. To avoid this, level 1. might be defined as relations to other discourses ''within'' the same discursive formation and type of discourse. Consequently, the definition of the levels depends on the definition of [[discourse|discursive formation]] and types of discourse, and the three levels may collapse to the extent that these concepts are not conceived. In short, the stratification of interdiscourse depends on the stratification of discourse.

==Power, ideology and interdiscursive configuration==

Level 2. and 3. may be conceived as particularly salient. This is explained in [[Marc Angenot]] and Bruce by reference to [[Bakhtin]]: In [[Bakhtin]]'s [[dialogism]], the utterance is the natural meaningful and finalised unit of speech, which others are supposed to respond to, that is, others ''interpret the utterance by situating it in a discursive context''. But, an utterance may be interpreted (contextualised) in various ways, and interdiscourse and interdiscursivity denote how certain such interpretations (and relations to other discourses) are socially more privileged than others. Since interdiscourse privileges certain interpretations, it has a close affinity to the concepts of [[ideology]], [[hegemony]] and [[power (sociology)]]. For Bakhtin/Voloshinov, signs are a reality that refracts another reality, that is, signs are ideological.&lt;ref&gt;Voloshinov 1973: 10&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the embedding of a discourse in an interdiscourse is an ideological interpretation of the discourse.

In [[Michel Foucault]], interdiscursivity is not bound to [[ideology]], but is a more open concept for analysing relations between [[discourse|discursive formations]], that is, mapping their interdiscursive configuration. Such analyses constitute a part of his [[discourse analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Foucault 1969: 88-90&lt;/ref&gt;

The cogent and restrictive character of the interdiscourse is reflected in the concept of the ''primacy of interdiscourse''.&lt;ref&gt;Maingueneau 1991: 20&lt;/ref&gt; The interdiscourse is the sayable, the opposite of what cannot be enunciated (l'inénoncable). But, the interdiscourse has also primacy in the sense that it ''defines the relations between discursive entities (or formations) that are constitutive of the discursive entities''. What is acceptable discourse, is in many respects a matter of interdiscursivity at level 2 and 3, because the interdiscursive import and export relations constitute a worksharing between the discursive entities, and this frames what is acceptable discourse within each discursive entity: Generally, a discourse has little authority over what other discourses are assumed to speak of and will therefore accept imported form and content from the other discourses. On the other hand, when a discourse exports content to other discourses, there are expectations as to the exported form and content. Thus, the interdiscursive system shapes the discourses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2217">In [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[category theory]] - internal categories are a generalisation of the notion of [[small category]], and are defined with respect to a fixed [[ambient category]]. If the ambient category is taken to be the [[category of sets]] then one recovers the theory of small categories. In general, internal categories consist of a pair of objects in the ambient category - thought of as the 'object of objects' and 'object of morphisms', together with a collection of morphisms in the ambient category satisfying certain identities. [[Group object]]s, are common examples of internal categories.

There are notions of internal functors and natural transformations which make the collection of internal categories in a fixed category into a [[2-category]].

==Definitions==

Let &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt; be a category with [[Pullback (category theory)|pullback]]s. An internal category in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; consists of the following data: two &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;-objects &lt;math&gt;C_0,C_1&lt;/math&gt; named "object of objects" and "object of morphisms" respectively and four &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;-arrows &lt;math&gt;d_0,d_1:C_1\rightarrow C_0, e:C_0\rightarrow C_1,m:C_1\times_{C_0}C_1\rightarrow C_1&lt;/math&gt; subject to coherence conditions expressing the axioms of category theory.

[[Image:International Civil Rights Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|268px|The promenade as seen in 2012]]
The '''International Civil Rights Walk of Fame''', which honors some of the activists involved in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and others involved in [[civil rights]] activities, was created in 2004 and is located at the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site]] in [[Atlanta]]. It consists of a promenade that showcases the footstep impressions of those honored, marked in granite and bronze. According to the [[National Park Service]], which runs the historic site, the Walk of Fame was created "to give recognition to those courageous soldiers of justice who sacrificed and struggled to make equality a reality for all." Another motivation was to enhance the historic value of the area, enrich its cultural heritage, and make the site a better tourist attraction.

The Walk of Fame is the brainchild of [[Xernona Clayton Brady|Xernona Clayton]], founder and executive producer of the [[Trumpet Awards]]. She is a civil rights figure in her own right. Clayton said, "This is a lasting memorial to those whose contributions were testaments to the fact that human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. This historic site will serve as a symbol of pride and a beacon of hope for all future generations. We are looking forward to building a monument to the civil struggle that depicts every step taken toward the goal of justice and the tireless exertions and passionate concern of these dedicated individuals."{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3601">The '''International Violence Against Women Act of 2015''' ('''I-VAWA''') is proposed legislation to address [[violence against women]] through [[United States]] foreign policy.  The legislation was introduced in the [[114th United States Congress]] in March, 2015. Similar legislation was introduced in the [[110th United States Congress|110th]] and [[111th United States Congress]] but was not passed into law.

==Background==
At least 1 in 3 women around the world are subject to [[sexual abuse|sexual]], [[physical abuse|physical]] or other [[abuse]] during their life, per estimates by the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]].  Not only does violence against women prevent mothers from raising healthy children, it also affects the economic progress and stability within the country in which they live.&lt;ref name=AI-IssueBrief&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/ivawa_ib2.pdf ''The International Violence Against Women Act (I-VAWA) (S.2982, HR. 4594)''.] [[Amnesty International]] Issue Brief No. 2. March 2010. Retrieved November 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Violence Against Women Act of 2015==
The International Violence Against Women Act of 2015 (I-VAWA) (S.713, HR. 1340) was introduced to ensure that addressing violence against women is included in the nation's foreign policy, with best practices for  preventing violence, protecting victims and prosecuting offenders.&lt;ref name=AI-IssueBrief/&gt;

The legislation was the result of efforts by:
* [[Amnesty International USA]]
* [[Family Violence Prevention Fund]]
* [[Women Thrive Worldwide]].&lt;ref name=AI-IssueBrief/&gt;

Experts in related fields from 40 international and 150 U.S. groups provided input for the legislation.&lt;ref name=AI-IssueBrief/&gt;

The House of Representatives Bill (HR. 1340) was brought before the [[114th_United_States_Congress|114th Congress]], sponsored by Representative [[Jan_Schakowsky|Janice Schakowsky]], [[Illinois's 9th congressional district]]. The Senate Bill (S.713), was introduced by Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] of [[California]].

==Criticism==
I-VAWA has been criticized on the grounds that it would discriminate against male victims and impose Western values upon other societies.  According to [[Wendy McElroy]], a research fellow at [[The Independent Institute]], the Act "constitutes a 5-year redirection of foreign aid funds in order to insert politically-correct feminism into the structure of other nations" and "revictimizes every male victim by denying his existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/civil-rights/197947-i-vawas-global-lie|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|title=I-VAWA's global lie|journal=The Hill|date=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
Many organizations support the I-VAWA Act, some of which are:
* [[Amnesty International USA]]
* [[American Jewish World Service]]
* [[Human Rights Watch]]
* [[International Center for Research on Women]]
* [[International Rescue Committee]]
* [[Refugees International]]
* [[Vital Voices]]

'''''Kalpa''''' ({{lang-sa|कल्प}} ''kalpa'') is a [[Sanskrit]] word meaning a relatively long period of time (by human calculation) in [[Hindu cosmology|Hindu]] and [[Buddhist cosmology]]. The concept is first mentioned in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.
Romila Thapar&lt;ref&gt;The Past Before Us, London 2013, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; holds that "the kalpa is first referred to in the inscriptions of [[Asoka]]". In the [[Pali]] language of early Buddhism, the word takes the form ''kappa'', and is mentioned in the assumed oldest scripture of Buddhism, the [[Sutta Nipata]]. This speaks of "Kappâtita: one who has gone beyond time, an Arahant".&lt;ref&gt;Sn 373&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the Buddhist manuscripts dates back to the middle part of the last millennium BCE.

Generally speaking, a kalpa is the period of time between the creation and recreation of a world or universe.&lt;ref name=Buddhistdoor&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Chapter 36: The Buddhas in the three periods of time|work=Buddhism in a Nutshell Archives|publisher=Buddhistdoor International|location=Hong Kong|year=|url=http://www.buddhistdoor.com/OldWeb/bdoor/archive/nutshell/teach36.htm|accessdate=2014-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of a kalpa equaling 4.32 billion years is found in the ''[[Puranas]]''—specifically ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]''.&lt;ref name=Johnson2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=W.J.|title=A Dictionary of Hinduism|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-861025-0|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
According to ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'',{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} there are several explanations for types of kalpas and their duration. In the first explanation, there are four types:

# ''Ayu-Kalpa'' – a variable time span representing the life expectancy of a typical human being in a particular era or ''[[yuga]]''. This can be as high as one ''[[Asaṃkhyeya|asankya]]'' or as small as 10 years. This number is directly proportional to the level of virtue of people in that era. Currently this value hovers around 100 years and is continually decreasing.
# ''Antah-Kalpa'' – the time it takes for one ayu-kalpa to grow from 10 years up to one ''asankya'' and back to 10 years. The ending of one antah-kalpa (or mass-extinction) can happen in one of three ways, all involving the majority of the human population going extinct:
## ''Sashthrantha-Kalpa'' – Mass extinction by wars.
## ''Durbhikshantha-Kalpa'' – Mass extinction by hunger.
## ''Rogantha-Kalpa'' – Mass extinction by plague.
# ''Asankya-Kalpa'' – time span of 20 antah-kalpas. One is equivalent to a quarter of ''maha-kalpa''.
# ''Maha-Kalpa'' – largest time unit in Buddhism. Ending of a maha-kalpa ([[apocalypse]]) can happen in three ways: fire, water and wind. It is divided into four quarters each equivalent to one ''asankya-kalpa''.
## First quarter – time taken for this world to form.
## Second quarter – stable duration of this world where all living beings can thrive.
## Third quarter – time taken for this world to be destroyed.
## Fourth quarter – empty time period.

In another simple explanation, there are four different lengths of kalpas. A regular kalpa is approximately 16 million years long (16,798,000 years&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Ronald B.(2002). ''Buddhist Text Translation Society's Buddhism A to Z'' p. 204. Buddhist Text Translation Society. {{ISBN|0-88139-353-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88139-353-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), and a ''small'' kalpa is 1000 regular kalpas, or about 16 billion years. Further, a ''medium'' kalpa is roughly 320 billion years, the equivalent of 20 small kalpas. A ''great'' kalpa is 4 medium kalpas, or around 1.28 trillion years.

Buddha had not spoken about the exact length of the ''maha-kalpa'' in number of years. However, he had given several astounding analogies to understand it.

# Imagine a huge empty cube at the beginning of a kalpa, approximately 16 miles in each side. Once every 100 years, you insert a tiny mustard seed into the cube. According to the Buddha, the huge cube will be filled even before the kalpa ends.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
# Imagine a gigantic rocky mountain at the beginning of kalpa, approximately 16 x 16 x 16 miles (dwarfing [[Mount Everest]]). You take a small piece of silk and wipe the mountain once every 100 years. According to the Buddha, the mountain will be completely depleted even before the kalpa ends.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In one situation, some monks wanted to know how many kalpas had died so far. The Buddha gave the analogy:

# If you count the total number of sand particles at the depths of the Ganges river, from where it begins to where it ends at the sea, even that number will be less than the number of passed kalpas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Epstein|first=Ronald|authorlink=Ronald B. Epstein|title=Buddhism A to Z|publisher=The Buddhist Text Translation Society|year=2003|location=Burlingame, California, United States.|isbn=0-88139-353-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
In [[Hinduism]] (cf. [[Hindu units of time|Hindu Time Cycles]]), it is equal to 4.32 billion years, a "day of [[Brahma]]" or one thousand ''mahayugas'',&lt;ref name=Johnson2009/&gt; measuring the duration of the world. Each kalpa is divided into 14 ''[[manvantara]]'' periods, each lasting 71 yuga cycles (306,720,000 years). Preceding the first and following each manvantara period is a juncture (sandhya) the length of a Satya-yuga (1,728,000) years.&lt;ref&gt;Cremo, M.A., 1999. Puranic time and the archaeological record. In T. Murray (ed.), Time and Archaeology 38–48. London: Routledge. http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/379479&lt;/ref&gt; Two kalpas constitute a day and night of Brahma. A "month of Brahma" is supposed to contain thirty such days (including nights), or 259.2 billion years. According to the [[Mahabharata]], 12 months of Brahma (=360 days) constitute his year, and 100 such years the life cycle of the universe. Fifty years of Brahma are supposed to have elapsed, and we are now in the ''shvetavaraha kalpa'' of the fifty-first; at the end of a kalpa the world is annihilated.

==Other periods of time==
"The duration of the material universe is limited. It is manifested in cycles of kalpas. A kalpa is a day of Brahmā, and one day of Brahmā consists of a thousand cycles of four yugas, or ages: [[Satya Yuga]], [[Treta Yuga]], [[Dvapara Yuga]] and [[Kali Yuga]]. The cycle of Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being practically no ignorance and vice, and the yuga lasts 1,728,000 years. In the Tretā-yuga vice is introduced, and this yuga lasts 1,296,000 years. In the Dvāpara-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice increasing, and this yuga lasts 864,000 years. And finally in Kali-yuga (the yuga we have now been experiencing over the past 5,000 years) there is an abundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and this yuga lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that at the termination of the yuga the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the [[Kalki]] avatāra, vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another Satya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling again. These four yugas, rotating a thousand times, comprise one day of Brahmā, and the same number comprise one night. Brahmā lives one hundred of such "years" and then dies. These "hundred years" total 311 trillion 40 billion (311,040,000,000,000) earth years. By these calculations the life of Brahmā seems fantastic and interminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity it is as brief as a lightning flash. In the [[Causal Ocean]] there are innumerable Brahmās rising and disappearing like bubbles in the Atlantic. Brahmā and his creation are all part of the material universe, and therefore they are in constant flux" (Bhagavad-gītā As It Is 8.17).&lt;ref&gt;http://vedabase.net/bg/8/17/&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous kalpa was the ''vyuhakalpa'' (Glorious aeon), the present kalpa is called the ''bhadrakalpa'' (Auspicious aeon), and the next kalpa will be the ''naksatrakalpa'' (Constellation aeon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buswell Jr.|first=RE|last2=Lopez Jr.|first2=DS|title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|edition=1st|pages=106|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|year=2014|isbn=978-0-691-15786-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DXN2AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=Buddhas+of+the+present+kalpa#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhas%20of%20the%20present%20kalpa&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Matsya Purana]] (290.3-12) lists the names of 30 kalpas, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Vasu, S.C. &amp; others (1972). ''The Matsya Puranam'', Part II, Delhi: Oriental Publishers, p.366&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vayu Purana]] in chapter 21 gives yet another list of 28 kalpas. It also lists five more kalpas in the next chapter.

==In popular culture==
===Influence on the ''Elder Scrolls'' series===
The concept of kalpas was an inspiration for the kalpas of the universe of the ''[[The Elder Scrolls|Elder Scrolls]]'' series of [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[open world]] [[fantasy]] video games. In ''The Elder Scrolls'', kalpas represent each life cycle of the mortal realm of Mundus.&lt;ref name="Paarthy"&gt;Paarthurnax's dialogue in ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''City at the End of Time'' ===
In ''[[City at the End of Time]]'', a science fiction novel by [[Greg Bear]], Kalpa is a fortress city built on Earth by descendants of humans in the last period of the Universe to protect themselves from the Chaos that is devouring it.

'''''Kinder, Küche, Kirche''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkɪndɐ ˈkʏçə ˈkɪʁçə}}), or the '''3 Ks''', is a [[German language|German]] slogan translated as “children, kitchen, church”. It now has a mostly derogatory connotation, describing what is seen as an antiquated female role model in contemporary Western society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/de/kinder-k%C3%BCche-kirche-nein-danke/a-1284368|title=Kinder, Küche, Kirche: Nein danke!|last=Mast-Kirschning|first=Ulrike|date=3 August 2004|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|language=German|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/leben/die-besten-trios-aller-guten-dinge-sind-drei-1.73403-2|title=Kinder, Küche, Kirche|publisher=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|language=German|date=6 January 2010|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is vaguely equivalent to the American "[[barefoot and pregnant]]" or the Victorian "A woman's place is in the home".

== The origins ==
The origins of the phrase are normally attributed either to the last German Emperor [[Wilhelm II]], or to his first wife, Empress [[Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein|Augusta Victoria]]. She is likely to have adopted it from one of several similar German "sayings by number". The most suggestive of these is listed in the second volume of ''German proverbs Glossary: A treasure house of the German people'' published in 1870 by [[Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wander]]: "Vier K gehören zu einem frommen Weib, nemlich, dass sie Achtung gebe auff die Kirche, Kammer, Kuche, Kinder." - "Four K's are requisite of a pious woman, namely, that she keeps regard for church, chamber, kitchen, children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deutsches sprichwörter-lexikon: bd. Gott bis Lehren |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ocM4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA501&amp;dq=%22Kirche,+Kammer,+K%C3%BCche,+Kinder%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kirche%2C%20Kammer%22&amp;f=false|last1=Wander|first1=Karl Friedrich Wilhelm|year=1870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wander refers for the origins of this saying to a 16th-century commentary on [[Sirach]] by [[Johannes Mathesius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deutsches Sprichwörterlexikon: Ein Hausschatz für das deutsche Volk. A bis Gothen, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FMpIAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Deutsches+Sprichw%C3%B6rterlexikon:+ein+Hausschatz+f%C3%BCr+das+deutsche+...,+Volume+1#v=onepage&amp;q=Mathesy&amp;f=false|last1=Wander|first1=Karl Friedrich Wilhelm|year=1867}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also lists another similar phrase: "Eine gute Hausfrau hat fünf K zu besorgen: Kammer, Kinder, Küche, Keller, Kleider." - "A good housewife has to take care of five K: chamber, kids, kitchen, cellar, clothes," which appeared first in the 1810 collection of the German proverbs ''Die weisheit auf der gasse: oder Sinn und geist deutscher sprichwörter'' - ''The wisdom of the streets; or, meaning and spirit of German proverbs''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Die weisheit auf der gasse: oder Sinn und geist deutscher sprichwörter |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NepLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=Kammer,+Kinder,+K%C3%BCche,+Keller,+Kleider#v=onepage&amp;q=Kammer%2C%20Kinder%2C%20K%C3%BCche%2C%20Keller%2C%20Kleider&amp;f=false|last1=Sailer|first1=Johann Michael|year=1810}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by [[Johann Michael Sailer]]. In 1844 "The newspaper for the German Nobility" published this latter saying in its traditional last page "feature" short statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Zeitung für den deutschen Adel |url=https://books.google.com/?id=df5BAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=%22Kinder,+k%C3%BCche%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kinder%2C%20k%C3%BCche%22&amp;f=false|year=1844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase started to appear in its current form in writing in the early 1890s. "After Germany, where women apparently take no interest in public affairs, and seem to obey to the letter the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|young emperor's]] injunction "Let women devote themselves to the three K's, -- ''die Küche, die Kirche, die Kinder''" (kitchen, church, and children), the active interest and influence of English women on all great questions were refreshing." wrote Marie C. Remick in ''A Woman's Travel-notes on England'' in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Unitarian, a monthly magazine of liberal christianity |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xf0kAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22die+K%C3%BCche,+die+Kirche,+die+Kinder%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22die%20K%C3%BCche%2C%20die%20Kirche%2C%20die%20Kinder%22&amp;f=false|last1=Sunderland|first1=Jabez Thomas|last2=Herford|first2=Brooke|last3=Mott|first3=Frederick B|year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase then was used multiple times throughout the 1890s in liberal writing and speeches.

In August 1899 the influential British liberal ''[[Westminster Gazette]]'' elaborated on the story, mentioning, as well, the 4th "K". A story titled "The American Lady and the Kaiser. The Empress's four K's"&lt;ref&gt;The American Lady and the Kaiser. The Empress's four K's, in: Westminster Gazette, 17. 8. 1899, S. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; describes an audience given by the Kaiser to two American [[suffragettes]]. After hearing them out, the Kaiser replies: "I agree with my wife. And do you know what she says? She says that women have no business interfering with anything outside the four K's. The four K's are&amp;nbsp;– Kinder, Küche, Kirche, and Kleider: Children, Kitchen, Church, and Clothing".&lt;ref&gt;Paletschek, Sylvia, [http://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/volltexte/4725/pdf/Paletschek_Kinder_Kueche_Kirche.pdf ''Kinder – Küche – Kirche'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kaiser's 4 K's'' is encountered again in [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s 1911 book ''The man-made world''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=  Charlotte Perkins Gilman, The man-made world; or, Our Androcentirc Culture. New York, Charton Co., 1911 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=FHAuAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Gilman+The+man-made+world&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Kinder%2C%20&amp;f=false|last1= Gilman|first1= Charlotte Perkins|year= 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "3 K's" variation has remained by far more popular and well known.

== Third Reich ==

When Hitler came to power in 1933, he introduced a Law for the Encouragement of Marriage, which entitled newly married couples to a [[Marriage loan|loan]] of 1000 marks (around 9 months' average wages at that time). On their first child, they could keep 250 marks. On their second, they could keep another 250. They reclaimed all of the loan by their fourth child.

In a September 1934 speech to the [[NS-Frauenschaft|National Socialist Women's Organization]], [[Adolf Hitler]] argued that for the German woman her "world is her husband, her family, her children, and her home",&lt;ref&gt;Doramus, Max, ''The Complete Hitler. A Digital Desktop Reference to His Speeches &amp; Proclamations, 1932-1945'' (Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, 1990), 532&lt;/ref&gt; a policy which was reinforced by the stress on "Kinder" and "Küche" in propaganda, and the bestowing of the [[Cross of Honor of the German Mother]] on women bearing four or more babies.

During this period, women were discriminated against in employment and forced out or bribed with numerous social benefits. Medicine, the law and civil service were occupations reserved for men alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERwomen.htm Spartacus Educational] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510014058/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERwomen.htm |date=2006-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his essays, [[T. S. Eliot]] reproduces and then comments upon a column in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' of May 10, 1939 headed {{"'}}Back to the Kitchen' Creed Denounced":

{{quote|Miss Bower of the Ministry of Transport, who moved that the association should take steps to obtain the removal of the ban (i.e. against married women Civil Servants) said it was wise to abolish an institution which embodied one of the main tenets of the Nazi creed – the relegation of women to the sphere of the kitchen, the children and the church.

The report, by its abbreviation, may do less than justice to Miss Bower, but I do not think that I am unfair to the report, in finding the implication that what is Nazi is wrong, and need not be discussed on its own merits. Incidentally, the term "relegation of women" prejudices the issue. Might one suggest that the kitchen, the children and the church could be considered to have a claim upon the attention of married women? or that no normal married woman would prefer to be a wage-earner if she could help it? What is miserable is a system that makes the dual wage necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= T. S. Eliot, Christianity and Culture |url= https://books.google.com/?id=eUsTlf1F2lYC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=%22the+kitchen,+the+children,+and+the+church%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20kitchen%2C%20the%20children%2C%20and%20the%20church%22&amp;f=false|isbn= 978-0156177351|last1= Eliot|first1= Thomas Stearns|year= 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During World War II in Germany, women eventually were put back in the factories because of the growing losses in the armed forces and the desperate lack of equipment on the front lines.

== Post-World War II ==

The phrase continued to be used in [[feminism|feminist]] and anti-feminist writing in the English-speaking world in the 1950s and 1960s. So, notably, the first version of the classic feminist paper by [[Naomi Weisstein]] "Psychology Constructs the Female"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= N. Weisstein, Psychology Constructs the Female |url= http://www.cwluherstory.com/psychology-constructs-the-female.html |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927130950/http://www.cwluherstory.com/psychology-constructs-the-female.html |archivedate= 2011-09-27 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; was titled "Kinder, Küche, Kirche as Scientific Law: Psychology Constructs the Female".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4979">{{Other uses|Map (disambiguation)}}

In [[mathematics]], the term '''mapping''', sometimes shortened to '''map''', refers to either a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], often with some sort of special structure, or a [[morphism]] in category theory, which generalizes the idea of a function. There are also a few, less common uses in logic and graph theory.

==Maps as functions==
{{Main article|Function (mathematics)}}

In many branches of mathematics, the term '''map''' is used to mean a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], sometimes with a specific property of particular importance to that branch.  For instance, a "map" is a ''[[continuous function]]'' in [[topology]], a ''[[Linear map|linear transformation]]'' in [[linear algebra]], etc.

Some authors, such as [[Serge Lang]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Serge|last=Lang|title=Linear Algebra|edition=2nd|year=1971|page=83|publisher=Addison-Wesley}}&lt;/ref&gt; use "function" only to refer to maps in which the [[codomain]] is a set of numbers (i.e. a subset of the [[Field (mathematics)|field]]s '''R''' or '''C''') and the term ''mapping'' for more general functions.

Sets of maps of special kinds are the subjects of many important theories: see for instance [[Lie group]], [[mapping class group]], [[permutation group]].&lt;!-- many more to add here--&gt;

In the theory of [[dynamical system]]s, a map denotes an [[Discrete-time dynamical system|evolution function]] used to create [[Dynamical system#Maps|discrete dynamical systems]]. See also [[Poincaré map]].

A ''partial map'' is a ''[[partial function]]'', and a ''total map'' is a ''[[total function]]''. Related terms like ''[[Domain (mathematics)|domain]]'', ''[[codomain]]'', ''[[Injective function|injective]]'', ''[[Continuous function|continuous]]'', etc. can be applied equally to maps and functions, with the same meaning. All these usages can be applied to "maps" as general functions or as functions with special properties.

==Maps as morphisms==
{{Main article|Morphism}}

In [[category theory]], "map" is often used as a synonym for [[morphism]] or arrow, thus for something more general than a function.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An Introduction to Category Theory|first=H.|last=Simmons|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=9781139503327|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VOCQUC_uiWgC&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, morphisms &lt;math&gt;f\, X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;, in a [[Concrete category| concrete category]], in other words morphisms that can be viewed as functions, carry with them the information of both its domain (the source &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of the morphism), but also its co-domain (the target &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;). In the widely used definition of function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;, this is a subset of &lt;math&gt;X\times Y&lt;/math&gt; consisting of all the pairs &lt;math&gt;(x,f(x))&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. In this sense, the function doesn't capture the information of which set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is used as the co-domain. Only the range &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the function.

==Other uses==
===In logic===
In [[formal logic]], the term '''map'''  is sometimes used for a ''[[functional predicate]]'', whereas a function is a [[model (logic)|model]] of such a [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] in [[set theory]].

===In graph theory===
[[File:Dodecahedron schlegel diagram.png|thumb|An example of a map in [[graph theory]]]]

In [[graph theory]], a '''map''' is a drawing of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] on a surface without overlapping edges (an [[Graph embedding|embedding]]). If the surface is a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] then a map is a [[planar graph]], similar to a [[political map]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Jonathan|last1=Gross|first2=Jay|last2=Yellen|title=Graph Theory and its applications|year=1998|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-8493-3982-0|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In computer science===
In the communities surrounding [[programming language]]s that treat functions as [[first-class citizen]]s, a [[Map (higher-order function)|map]] often refers to the [[Binary function|binary]] [[higher-order function]] that takes a function ''f'' and a [[List (abstract data type)|list]] {{nowrap|[''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} as [[Argument of a function|arguments]] and returns {{nowrap|[''f''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), ''f''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., ''f''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)]}}, where {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 0}}.

{{Descartes}}
'''Mental substance''' is the idea held by [[Mind-body dualism|dualists]] and [[idealism|idealists]], that minds are made-up of non-physical substance. This substance is often referred to as [[consciousness]].

This is opposed to the [[materialism|materialists]], who hold that what we normally think of as mental substance is ultimately physical matter (i.e., brains).

[[René Descartes|Descartes]], who was most famous for the assertion "[[I think therefore I am]]", has had a lot of influence on the [[mind–body problem]]. He describes his theory of mental substance (which he calls '''''res cogitans''''' distinguishing it from the ''[[res extensa]]'') in the ''Second [[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditation]]'' (II.8) and in ''[[Principia Philosophiae]]'' (2.002).

He used a more precise definition of the word "substance" than is currently popular: that a substance is something which can exist without the existence of any other substance. For many philosophers, this word or the phrase "mental substance" has a special meaning.

[[Gottfried Leibniz]], belonging to the generation immediately after Descartes, held the position that the mental world was built up by [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]s, mental objects that are not part of the physical world (see ''[[Monadology]]'').

{{Political campaigning}}

'''Negative campaigning''' or '''mudslinging''' is the process of deliberate spreading negative information about someone or something to worsen the [[public relations|public image]] of the described.

Deliberate spreading of such information can be motivated either by honest desire of the campaigner to warn others against real dangers or deficiencies of the described, or by the campaigner's dishonest ideas on methods of  winning in political, business or other spheres of competition against an honest rival.

The public image of an entity can be defined as [[reputation]], esteem, [[respect]], acceptance of the entity's appearance, [[values]] and behaviour by the general public of a given territory and/or a [[social group]], possibly within time limits. As target groups of public and their values differ, so negativity or positivity of a public image is relative: e.g. while in most societies having an honest source of income is a positive value and stealing is discouraged,  in the world of professional thieves honest work is frowned upon and stealing is encouraged. In [[polygamous]] societies [[monogamy]] is not viewed in the way it is valued in monogamous societies. Values of a society also change with time: e.g. homosexuality in [[Western culture]] was considered immoral and was [[Homosexuality#Legality|criminally prosecuted]] until the [[sexual revolution]] of the second half of the 20 century.
Thus negative campaigning to be successful has to take into account current values of the group it addresses. The degree of strictness in practicing the group's values as opposed to its tolerance for violating the norms has also to be taken into consideration: e.g. while in the [[Old Testament]] and other traditional religious societies [[adultery]] and [[prostitution]] were outlawed and supposed to be punished by death, modern Western societies show much greater tolerance to these.

In [[United States politics]], negative campaigning has been called "as [[American way of life|American]] as Mississippi mud" and "as American as apple pie".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The modern presidential campaign: Mudslinging, bombast, and the vitality of American politics|last = Scher|first = R. K.|publisher = M. E. Sharpe|year = 1997|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research suggests negative campaigning is the norm in all political venues, mitigated only by the dynamics of a particular contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/seminars/russian5.pdf|title=The Rational Attacker in Russia? Negative Campaigning in Russian Presidential Elections|doi=10.1111/1468-2508.00117|jstor=2691664|author1=Lee Sigelman|author2=Eric Shiraev|journal=The Journal of Politics|year=2002|volume=64|issue=1|pages=45–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==

There are a number of techniques used in negative campaigning.  Among the most effective is running [[advertisement]]s attacking an opponent's personality, record, or opinion.  There are two main types of ads used in negative campaigning: attack and contrast.

Attack ads focus exclusively on the negative aspects of the opponent.  There is no positive content in an attack ad, whether it is about the candidate or the opponent.  Attack ads usually identify the risks associated with the opponent, often exploiting people’s fears to manipulate and lower the impression voters have of the opponent.  Because attack ads have no positive content, they have the potential to be more influential than contrast ads in shaping voters’ views of the sponsoring candidate’s opponent.&lt;ref name="Fridkin &amp; Kenney, 2004"&gt;Fridkin, K. L., &amp; Kenney, P. J. (2004). Do Negative Messages Work?: The Impact of Negativity on Citizens’ Evaluations of Candidates. American Politics Research, 32(570), 570–602. {{doi|10.1177/1532673X03260834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike attack ads, contrast ads contain information about both the candidate and the opponent.  The information about the candidate is positive, while the information about the opponent is negative.  Contrast ads compare and contrast the candidate with the opponent, juxtaposing the positive information about the candidate with the negative information of the opponent.  Because contrast ads must contain positive information, contrast ads are seen as less damaging to the political process than attack ads.&lt;ref name="Fridkin &amp; Kenney, 2004"/&gt;

One of the most famous such ads was ''[[Daisy (television commercial)|Daisy Girl]]'' by the campaign of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] that successfully portrayed Republican [[Barry Goldwater]] as threatening [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Common negative campaign techniques include painting an opponent as soft on criminals, dishonest, corrupt, or a danger to the nation. One common negative campaigning tactic is attacking the other side for running a negative campaign.

Dirty tricks are also common in negative political campaigns. These generally involve secretly leaking damaging information to the media. This isolates a candidate from backlash and also does not cost any money. The material must be substantive enough to attract media interest, however, and if the truth is discovered it could severely damage a campaign. Other dirty tricks include trying to feed an opponent's team false information hoping they will use it and embarrass themselves.

Often a campaign will use outside organizations, such as [[lobbying|lobby groups]], to launch attacks. These can be claimed to be coming from a neutral source and if the allegations turn out not to be true the attacking candidate will not be damaged if the links cannot be proven. Negative campaigning can be conducted by proxy. For instance, highly partisan ads were placed in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]] by allegedly independent bodies like [[MoveOn.org]] and [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]].

[[Push poll]]s are attacks disguised as [[Robo call#Political calls|telephone polls]]. They might ask a question like "How would you react if Candidate A was revealed to beat his wife?", giving the impression that Candidate A might beat his wife. Members of the media and of the opposing party are deliberately not called making these tactics all but invisible and unprovable.

[[G. Gordon Liddy]] played a major role in developing these tactics during the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] campaign playing an important advisory of rules that led to the [[campaign of 1972]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} [[James Carville]], campaign manager of [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1992 election, is also a major proponent of negative tactics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} [[Lee Atwater]], best known for being an advisor to presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]], also pioneered many negative campaign techniques seen in political campaigns today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/opinion/20sat3.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Political Legacy of Baaad Boy Atwater | first=Eleanor | last=Randolph | date=September 20, 2008 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Sponsors of overt negative campaigns often cite reasons to support [[mass communication]] of negative ideas. The [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] uses negative campaigns to steer the public away from health risks. Similar negative campaigns have been used to rebut mass marketing by [[tobacco companies]], or to discourage [[drunk driving]]. Those who conduct negative political campaigns sometimes say the public needs to know about the person he or she is voting for, even if it is bad. In other words, if a candidate’s opponent is a crook or a bad person, then he or she should be able to tell the public about it.

[[Martin Wattenberg (political scientist)|Martin Wattenberg]] and [[Craig Brians]], of the University of California, Irvine, considered in their study whether negative campaigning mobilizes or alienates voters. They concluded that data used by [[Stephen Ansolabehere]] in a 1994 American Political Science Review article to advance the hypothesis that negative campaigning demobilizes voters was flawed.

A subsequent study done by Ansolabehere and [[Shanto Iyengar]] in 1995&lt;ref name="Ansolabehere, S. 1995"&gt;Ansolabehere, S. &amp; Iyengar, S. (1995). Going negative: How campaign advertising shrinks and polarizes the electorate. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; corrected some of the previous study's flaws. This study concluded that negative advertising suppressed voter turnout, particularly for Independent voters. They speculated that campaigns tend to go negative only if the Independent vote is leaning toward the opponent. In doing so, they insure that the swing voters stay home, leaving the election up to base voters. They also found that negative ads have a greater impact on Democrats than on Republicans. According to them, base Republicans will vote no matter what (and will vote only for a Republican), but Democrats can be influenced to either stay home and not vote at all or to switch sides and vote for a Republican. This, combined with the effect negativity has on Independents, led them to conclude that Republicans benefit more from going negative than Democrats.

Other researchers have found different, more positive outcomes from negative campaigns. [[Rick Farmer]], PhD, an assistant professor of political science at the [[University of Akron]] found that negative ads are more memorable than positive ads when they reinforce a preexisting belief and are relevant to the central issues of a marketing campaign. Researchers at the [[University of Georgia]] found the impact of negative ads increases over time, while positive ads used to counteract negative ads lack the power of negative ads&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_11_32/ai_n8569068 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622031838/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_11_32/ai_n8569068 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-06-22 |title=Sock it to 'em: can a negative marketing campaign have positive results?

Most recently, [[Kyle Mattes]] and [[David P. Redlawsk]] in ''The Positive Case for Negative Campaigning'' show through surveys and experiments that negative campaigning provides informational benefits for voters. Without negativity, voters would not have full information about all of their choices, since no candidate will say anything bad about herself. They argue that candidates have to point out the flaws in their opponents for voters to be fully informed.

== Risks and consequences ==
Some strategists say that an effect of negative campaigning is that while it motivates the base of support it can alienate centrist and undecided voters from the political process, reducing [[voter turnout]] and radicalizing politics.&lt;ref name="Ansolabehere, S. 1995"/&gt; 
In a study done by Gina Garramone about how negative advertising affects the political process, it was found that a consequence of negative campaigning is greater image discrimination of the candidates and greater attitude polarization.  While positive ads also contributed to the image discrimination and attitude polarization, Garramone found that negative campaigning played a more influential role in the discrimination and polarization than positive campaigning.&lt;ref name="Garramone 1990"&gt;Garramone, G. M., Atkin, C. K., Pinkleton, B. E., &amp; Cole, R. T. (1990, Summer). Effects of Negative Political Advertising on the Political Process. Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 34(3), 299–311. {{doi|10.1080/08838159009386744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative ads can produce a backlash. A [[1993 Chrétien attack ad|disastrous ad]] was run by the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 Canadian federal election]], apparently emphasizing [[Liberal Party of Canada]] leader [[Jean Chrétien]]'s [[Bell's Palsy]] partial facial paralysis in a number of unflattering photos, with the subtext of criticizing his platforms. Chrétien took maximum advantage of the opportunity to gain the public's sympathy as a man who struggled with a physical disability and his party's subsequent overwhelming victory in the election helped reduce the governing Conservatives to two seats.

A similar backlash happened to the Liberal Party in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] for running an [[2006 Liberal Party of Canada election ads|attack ad]] that suggested that [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] leader [[Stephen Harper]] would use Canadian soldiers to patrol Canadian cities, and impose some kind of martial law. The ad was only available from the Liberal Party's web site for a few hours prior to the release of the attack ads on television; nevertheless, it was picked up by the media and widely criticized for its absurdity, in particular the sentence "we're not making this up; we're not allowed to make this stuff up". Liberal MP Keith Martin expressed his disapproval of "whoever the idiot who approved that ad was," shortly before Liberal leader Paul Martin (no relation) stated that he had personally approved them. The effect of the ads was to diminish the credibility of the party's other attack ads. It offended many Canadians, particularly those in the military, some of whom were fighting in [[Afghanistan]] at the time.  (See [[Canadian federal election, 2006]])

More recently, in the 2008 US Senate race in [[North Carolina]], Republican incumbent [[Elizabeth Dole]] attempted an attack ad on Democratic challenger [[Kay Hagan]], who had taken a small lead in polls, by tying her to [[atheists]]. Dole's campaign released an ad questioning Hagan's religion and it included a voice saying "There is no God!" over a picture of Kay Hagan's face. The voice was not Hagan's but it is believed the ad implied that it was. Initially, it was thought the ad would work as religion has historically been a very important issue to voters in the American south, but the ad produced a backlash across the state and Hagan responded forcefully with an ad saying that she was a Sunday school teacher and was a religious person. Hagan also claimed Dole was trying to change the subject from the economy (the ad appeared around the same time as the [[2008 financial crisis]]). Hagan's lead in polls doubled and she won the race by a nine-point margin.

Because of the possible harm that can come from being seen as a negative campaigner, candidates often pledge to refrain from negative attacks. This pledge is usually abandoned when an opponent is perceived to be "going negative," with the first retaliatory attack being, ironically, an accusation that the opponent is a negative campaigner.

While some research has found advantages and other has found disadvantages, some studies find no difference between negative and positive approaches&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americandemocracy.nd.edu/working_papers/documents/Arceneaux_Nickerson_Negative_Messages.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325013318/http://americandemocracy.nd.edu/working_papers/documents/Arceneaux_Nickerson_Negative_Messages.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in the Journal of Advertising found that negative political advertising makes the body want to turn away physically, but the mind remembers negative messages. The findings are based on research conducted by James Angelini, professor of communication at the [[University of Delaware]], in collaboration with Samuel Bradley, assistant professor of advertising at [[Texas Tech University]], and Sungkyoung Lee of [[Indiana University]], which used ads that aired during the 2000 presidential election. During the study, the researchers placed electrodes under the eyes of willing participants and showed them a series of 30-second ads from both the [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]] campaigns. The electrodes picked up on the "startle response," the automatic eye movement typically seen in response to snakes, spiders and other threats. Compared to positive or neutral messages, negative advertising prompted greater reflex reactions and a desire to move away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/545187/ Viewers Are Repulsed by Negative Campaign Ads] Newswise, Retrieved on October 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

In [[statistical process control|statistical quality control]], the '''p-chart''' is a type of [[control chart]] used to monitor the proportion of [[Nonconformity (quality)|nonconforming units]] in a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]], where the sample proportion nonconforming is defined as the ratio of the number of nonconforming units to the sample size, n.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section3/pmc332.htm|title=Proportions Control Charts|accessdate=2010-01-05|work=[http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/index.htm NIST/Sematech Engineering Statistics Handbook]|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The p-chart only accommodates "pass"/"fail"-type inspection as determined by one or more [[Go-NoGo gauge|go-no go gauges]] or tests, effectively applying the [[Specification (technical standard)|specifications]] to the data ''before'' they are plotted on the chart.  Other types of control charts display the magnitude of the quality characteristic under study, making troubleshooting possible directly from those charts.

==Assumptions==
The [[binomial distribution]] is the basis for the p-chart and requires the following assumptions:&lt;ref name="Montgomery2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Montgomery | first = Douglas | title = Introduction to Statistical Quality Control | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], Inc. | year = 2005 | location = [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] | url = http://www.eas.asu.edu/~masmlab/montgomery/ | isbn = 978-0-471-65631-9 | oclc = 56729567 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080620095346/http://www.eas.asu.edu/~masmlab/montgomery/ | archivedate = 2008-06-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|267}}
*The probability of nonconformity {{math|&lt;VAR&gt;p&lt;/VAR&gt;}} is the same for each unit;
*Each unit is independent of its predecessors or successors;
*The inspection procedure is same for each sample and is carried out consistently from sample to sample
&lt;!-- NOTE: IF THE ABOVE THREE CONDITIONS ARE MET, THEN THE DATA FOLLOW A BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION--see the definition given in [[Binomial distribution]] --&gt;

==Calculation and plotting==
The control limits for this chart type are &lt;math&gt;\bar p \pm 3\sqrt{\frac{\bar p(1-\bar p)}{n}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\bar p&lt;/math&gt; is the estimate of the long-term process mean established during control-chart setup.&lt;ref name="Montgomery2005"/&gt;{{rp|268}} Naturally, if the lower control limit is less than or equal to zero, process observations only need be plotted against the upper control limit.  Note that observations of proportion nonconforming below a positive lower control limit are cause for concern as they are more frequently evidence of improperly calibrated test and inspection equipment or inadequately trained inspectors than of sustained quality improvement.&lt;ref name="Montgomery2005"/&gt;{{rp|279}}

Some organizations may elect to provide a standard value for p, effectively making it a target value for the proportion nonconforming.  This may be useful when simple process adjustments can consistently move the process mean, but in general, this makes it more challenging to judge whether a process is fully out of control or merely off-target (but otherwise in control).&lt;ref name="Montgomery2005"/&gt;{{rp|269}}

==Potential pitfalls==
There are two circumstances that merit special attention:
*Ensuring enough observations are taken for each sample
*Accounting for differences in the number of observations from sample to sample

===Adequate sample size===
Sampling requires some careful consideration.  If the organization elects to use 100% inspection on a process, the production rate determines an appropriate sampling rate which in turn determines the sample size.&lt;ref name="Montgomery2005"/&gt;{{rp|277}} If the organization elects to only inspect a fraction of units produced, the sample size should be chosen large enough so that the chance of finding at least one nonconforming unit in a sample is high—otherwise the false alarm rate is too high. One technique is to fix sample size so that there is a 50% chance of detecting a process shift of a given amount (for example, from 1% defective to 5% defective).  If δ is the size of the shift to detect, then the sample size should be set to &lt;math&gt;n \ge \left ( \frac{3}{\delta} \right )^2 \bar p(1-\bar p)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Montgomery2005"/&gt;{{rp|278}} Another technique is to choose the sample size large enough so that the p-chart has a positive lower control limit or &lt;math&gt;n &gt; \frac{3^2 (1 - \bar p)}{\bar p}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Varying sample sizes===
In the case of 100% inspection, variation in the production rate (e.g., due to maintenance or shift changes) conspires to produce different sample sizes for each observation plotted on the p-chart.  There are three ways to deal with this:

{| class="wikitable"
! Technique !! Description
|-
| Use variable-width control limits&lt;ref name="Montgomery2005"/&gt;{{rp|280}}
| Each observation plots against its own control limits: &lt;math&gt;\bar p \pm 3\sqrt{\frac{\bar p(1-\bar p)}{n_i}}&lt;/math&gt;, where n&lt;SUB&gt;i&lt;/SUB&gt; is the size of the sample that produced the ith observation on the p-chart
|-
| Use control limits based on an average sample size&lt;ref name="Montgomery2005"/&gt;{{rp|282}}
| Control limits are &lt;math&gt;\bar p \pm 3\sqrt{\frac{\bar p(1-\bar p)}{\bar n}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\bar n&lt;/math&gt; is the average size of all the samples on the p-chart, &lt;math&gt;\frac {\sum_{i=1}^m n_i}{m}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Use a standardized control chart&lt;ref name="Montgomery2005"/&gt;{{rp|283}}
| Control limits are ±3 and the observations, &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}_i&lt;/math&gt;, are [[Standard score|standardized]] using &lt;math&gt;Z_i = \frac {\hat{p}_i - \bar p}{\sqrt {\frac {\bar p (1 - \bar p)}{n_i}}}&lt;/math&gt;, where n&lt;SUB&gt;i&lt;/SUB&gt; is the size of the sample that produced the ith observation on the p-chart
|}

===Sensitivity of control limits===
Some practitioners have pointed out that the p-chart is sensitive to the underlying assumptions, using control limits derived from the binomial distribution rather than from the observed sample variance. Due to this sensitivity to the underlying assumptions, p-charts are often implemented incorrectly, with control limits that are either too wide or too narrow, leading to incorrect decisions regarding process stability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wheeler|first1=Donald|title=What about p-Charts?|url=https://www.qualitydigest.com/inside/quality-insider-article/what-about-p-charts.html|website=Quality Digest|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A p-chart is a form of the [[Shewhart individuals control chart|Individuals chart]] (also referred to as "XmR" or "ImR"), and these practitioners recommend the individuals chart as a more robust alternative for count-based data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  last = Wheeler | first = Donald | title = Understanding Variation: The Key to Managing Chaos | publisher = [[SPC Press]] |  year = 2000  | pages = 140 | url = http://www.spcpress.com/  | isbn = 0-945320-53-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Don Quijote de La Mancha, Teresa Carreño Teather.jpg|thumb|300px|A stage performance of ''[[Don Quixote (ballet)|Don Quixote]]'' at the [[Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex]] in [[Venezuela]] (2013)]]

'''Performance''' is completion of a task with application of knowledge, skills and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Shields|author2=Michelle Brown|author3=et al.|title=Managing Employee Performance and Reward: Concepts, Practices, Strategies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nKgCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|year=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-4-4115-2|pages=125+}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Management science ==
In work place, performance or job performance means good ranking with the hypothesized conception of requirements of a role. There are two types of job performances: contextual and task. Task performance is related to cognitive ability while contextual performance is dependent upon personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ivan T. Robertson|author2=Cary L. Cooper|title=Personnel Psychology and Human Resources Management: A Reader for Students and Practitioners|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5MtBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT24|date=12 January 2015|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-119-09060-1|pages=24+}}&lt;/ref&gt; Task performance are behavioral roles that are recognized in job descriptions and by remuneration systems, they are directly related to organizational performance, whereas, contextual performance are value based and additional behavioral roles that are not recognized in job descriptions and covered by compensation; they are extra roles that are indirectly related to organizational performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul R.

Lance|author3=David J. Woehr|title=Performance Measurement: Current Perspectives and Future Challenges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EunJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|year=2014|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-317-82454-1|pages=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sonnentag, S &amp; Frese, M. (2009). Dynamic Performance. In S.W.J Kozlowski (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arts ==
In the [[performing arts]], a performance generally comprises an event in which a performer or group of performers present one or more [[Work of art|works of art]] to an [[audience]]. In instrumental music (and in drama), performance is typically described as "play".&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Dorschel]], ''Music as Play.'' In: Paulo de Assis (ed.), ''Virtual Works – Actual Things: Essays in Musical Ontology.'' Leuven University Press, Leuven 2018 (Orpheus Institute Series), pp. 115–133. [https://orpheusinstituut.be/nl/publicaties/virtual-works-actual-things/ pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the performers participate in [[rehearsal]]s beforehand. 

An effective performance is determined by achievement skills and competency of the performer - level of skill and knowledge. Spencer and McClelland in 1994 defined competency as "a combination of motives, traits, self-concepts, attitudes, cognitive behavior skills (content knowledge)" that helps a performer to differentiate themselves superior from average performers.&lt;ref name="ShippmannAsh2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shippmann|first1=Jeffery S.|last2=Ash|first2=Ronald A.|last3=Batjtsta|first3=Mariangela|last4=Carr|first4=Linda|last5=Eyde|first5=Lorraine D.|last6=Hesketh|first6=Beryl|last7=Kehoe|first7=Jerry|last8=Pearlman|first8=Kenneth|last9=Prien|first9=Erich P.|last10=Sanchez|first10=Juan I.|title=THE PRACTICE OF COMPETENCY MODELING|journal=Personnel Psychology|volume=53|issue=3|year=2000|pages=703–740|issn=0031-5826|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.2000.tb00220.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A performance may also describe the way in which an [[actor]] performs. In a solo capacity, it may also refer to a [[mime artist]], [[comedian]], [[Evocation|conjurer]], or other entertainer.

== Performance state ==
[[File:Deep Purple - MN Gredos - 01.jpg|thumb|300px|English rock band [[Deep Purple]] performing in [[Hoyos del Espino]], [[Spain]] (2013)]]
Williams and Krane found the following characteristics define an ideal performance state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Haff , G. Gregory|author2=Triplett , N. Travis|title=Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bfuXCgAAQBAJ|edition=4th|year=2015|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-1-4925-0162-6|pages=156–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Absence of [[fear]]
* Not thinking about the performance
* Adaptive focus on the activity
* A sense of effortlessness and belief in confidence or [[self-efficacy]]
* A sense of personal control
* A distortion of time and space where time does not affect the activity

Other related factors are motivation to achieve success or avoid failure, task relevant attention, positive self-talk and cognitive regulation to achieve [[automaticity]]. Performance is also dependent on adaptation of eight areas: Handling crisis, managing stress, creative problem solving, knowing necessary functional tools and skills, agile management of complex processes, interpersonal adaptability, cultural adaptability, and physical fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank J. Landy|author2=Jeffrey M. Conte|title=Work in the 21st Century: An Introduction to Industrial and Organizational Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1K1rnp9uAscC&amp;pg=PA193|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9025-1|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance is not always a result of practice, it is about honing the skill, even over practice itself can result in failure due to [[ego depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J. L., Hardy, T., &amp; Arkin, R. (2009). When practice doesn't make perfect: Effort expenditure as an active behavioral self-handicapping strategy. Journal of Research in Personality, 43(1), 95-98. https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2008.10.004&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Stage fright ===
[[File:Kristin Chenoweth singing National Anthem at Yankee Stadium.jpg|120px|thumb|right|[[Kristin Chenoweth]] performs the national anthem of the United States at a [[baseball]] game]]
Theatrical performances, especially when the audience is limited to only a few observers, can lead to significant increases in the performer's heart rate above his or her baseline heart rate. This increase takes place in several stages relative to the performance itself, including anticipatory activation (one minute before the start of subject's speaking role), confrontation activation (during the subject's speaking role, at which point their heart rate peaks) and release period (one minute after the conclusion of the subject's speech).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin|first1=Sandra|title=Effect of Speakers' Sex and Size of Audience on Heart-Rate Changes During Short Impromptu Speeches|journal=Psychological Reports|date=1980|volume=46|issue=1|pages=123–130|pmid=7367532|doi=10.2466/pr0.1980.46.1.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same physiological reactions can be experienced in other mediums, such as instrumental performance. When experiments were conducted to determine whether there was a correlation between audience size and heart rate (an indicator of anxiety) of instrumental performers, the researcher's findings ran contrary to previous studies, showing a positive correlation rather than a negative one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Studer|first1=Regina|title=Psychophysiological Activation During Preparation, Performance, and Recovery in High- and Low-Anxious Music Students|journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback|date=2014|volume=39|issue=1|pages=45–57|doi=10.1007/s10484-014-9240-2|pmid=24477850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heart rate shares a strong, positive correlation with the self reported [[anxiety]] of performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maclntyre|first1=Valerie|title=Heart Rate Variability as a Predictor of Speaking Anxiety|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=2010|volume=27|issue=4|pages=286–297|doi=10.1080/08824096.2010.496323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other physiological responses to public performance include [[perspiration]], secretion of the [[adrenal glands]], and increased blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brutten|first1=Eugene|title=A Palmer Sweat Investigation of the Effect of Audience Variation Upon Stage Fright.|journal=Speech Monographs|date=1963|volume=30|issue=2|pages=92–96|doi=10.1080/03637756309375363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}
In [[Jainism]], '''Pudgala''' (or ''{{IAST|Pudgalāstikāya}}'') is one of the six [[Dravya (Jainism)|Dravya]]s, or aspects of reality that fabricate the world we live in. The six ''dravya''s include the [[jiva]] and the fivefold divisions of [[ajiva]] (non-living) category: ''dharma'' (motion), ''adharma'' (rest), ''akasha'' (space), ''pudgala'' (matter) and ''kala'' (time).&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Chandradhar (1960, reprint 1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pudgala'', like other ''dravya''s except ''kala'' is called ''astikaya'' in the sense that it occupies space. 

Pudgala is derived from the words 'pud', which is defined as Supplement (Addition /Fusion), and gala, which is defined as Disintegrate, or Division or Fission. Therefore, Pudgalas are best defined as all things that are continuously changing by the process of Supplementation or Disintegration, namely matter.

The individual unit of Pudgala is the material from which all is made called a [[Paramanu]], which, by the process of supplementation, can combine to form what can be roughly said is an aggregate, called a [[Skandha (Jainism)|Skandha]]. It possesses at all times four qualities, namely, a color (''varna''), a taste (''rasa''), a smell (''gandha''), and a certain kind of palpability (''sparsha'', touch).{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=90}}

In [[Buddhism]], ''Pudgala'' means the entity that reincarnates as an individual or person, i.e., the ''bundle of tendencies'' that keeps an individual reincarnating until they attain [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Surendranath (1975, reprint 2010).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8974">'''Rabin fairness''' is a fairness model invented by [[Matthew Rabin]]. It goes beyond the standard assumptions in modeling behavior, rationality and self-interest, to incorporate fairness.&lt;ref&gt;Camerer, Colin &amp; Thaler, Richard H. 2003. "[http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/089533003769204407 In Honor of Matthew Rabin: Winner of the John Bates Clark Medal]." ''Journal of Economic Perspectives.'' 17, 159-176&lt;/ref&gt; Rabin's fairness model incorporates findings from the fields of economics and psychology fields to provide an alternative utility model. Fairness is one type of [[social preferences|social preference]].

==Including fairness in the standard utility model==
Past utility models incorporated altruism or the fact that people may care not only about their own well-being, but also about the well-being of others. However, evidence indicates that pure altruism does not occur often, contrarily most altruistic behavior demonstrates three facts (as defined by Rabin) and these facts are proven by past events.&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, Matthew. 1993. "[https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt3s87d1tm/qt3s87d1tm.pdf Incorporating Fairness Into Game Theory and Economics]." ''The American Economic Review.''83, 1281-1302.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the existence of these three facts, Rabin created a utility function that incorporates fairness.:
# People are willing to sacrifice their own material well-being to help those who are being kind.
## The attempt to provide public goods without coercion departs from pure self-interest.
## Experiments show that people cooperate to contribute toward a public good to a degree greater than would be implied by pure self-interest.  Individually optimal contribution rates, as defined by the standard utility model, are close to 0 percent.
## During an experiment, the willingness for an individual to contribute to a public good is highly contingent on the behavior of others.
# People are willing to sacrifice their own material well-being to punish those who are being unkind.
## Evidence provided by the [[ultimatum game]], consisting of two people, a proposer and decider, splitting a fixed amount of money.  The proposer offers a division of the money, then the decider decides if he or she refuses or accepts the proposal.  If the decider says yes, they split the money according to the proposer's offer, but if the decider says no, neither person gets any money.&lt;ref&gt;Thaler, Richard H., "[http://www.economiapsicologica.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/thaler-mental-accounting-and-consumer-choice.pdf Mental Accounting and Consumer Choice]," ''Marketing Science,'' Summer 1985, ''4'', 199-214.&lt;/ref&gt;
## Standard utility model would find that any offer proposed to the decider should be expected if it is greater than zero because utility should increase with any increase in income. Along the same lines, the standard utility model would predict that the  proposer would offer the smallest amount of money possible to the decider in order to maximize his or her own utility
## However, data shows that deciders are willing to punish any unfair offer and proposers tend to make fair offers.
# Both motivations 1 and 2 have a greater effect on behavior as the material cost of sacrificing becomes smaller.

==Rabin's fairness model==
Rabin formalized fairness using a two-person, modified [[game theory]] matrix with two decisions (a two by two matrix), where i is the person whose utility is being measured. Furthermore, within the game theory matrix payoffs for each person are allocated.  The following formula was created by Rabin to model utility to include fairness:

&lt;math&gt;U_i(a_i, b_j, c_i) = \pi_i(a_i, b_j) + f_j(b_j, c_i) * [1+f_i(a_i, b_j)].&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
# a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; represents player i's strategy, b&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; represents player i's belief about what player j's strategy will be, and c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; represents what player i's beliefs about player j's beliefs about player i's strategy.
## Although this seems complicated, a is simply player i's strategy, b is player j's strategy given how he/she believes player i will act, and c is player i's decision given what strategy player j is believed to partake in. 
## In the game below, a, b, and c, will all take the form of either Grab or Share and then the payoffs would be determined and placed into Rabin's Fairness Model.
# &lt;math&gt;\pi_i(a_i, b_j)&lt;/math&gt; represents the payoffs player i receives
# Player i's kindness to player j is given by: &lt;math&gt;f_i(a_i, b_j) = [\pi_j(b_j, a_i) - \pi_j^e(b_j)]/[\pi_j^h(b_j) - \pi_j^\text{min}(b_j)]&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;\pi_j^e(b_j)= [\pi_j^h(b_j)+ \pi_j^l(b_j)]/2,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\pi_j^h(b_j)&lt;/math&gt; is player j's highest payoff and &lt;math&gt;\pi_j^l(b_j)&lt;/math&gt; is player j's lowest payoff among points that are [[Pareto efficient]]
## &lt;math&gt;\pi_j^\text{min}(b_j)&lt;/math&gt; is the worst possible payoff in the matrix for player j
# Player i's belief about how kind player j is being to him is given by: &lt;math&gt;f_j(b_j, c_i) = [\pi_i(c_i, b_j) - \pi_i^e(c_i)]/[\pi_j^h(c_i) - \pi_j^\text{min}(c_i)]&lt;/math&gt;
## &lt;math&gt;\pi_i^\text{min}(c_i)&lt;/math&gt; is player i's worst possible payoff
## &lt;math&gt;\pi_i^e(c_i)= [\pi_i^h(c_i)+ \pi_i^l(c_i)]/2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\pi_i^h(c_i)&lt;/math&gt; is player j's highest payoff and &lt;math&gt;\pi_{i^l}(c_i)&lt;/math&gt; is player i's lowest payoff among points that are Pareto efficient
# The two functions above can now specify player's preferences.  Player i chooses a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to maximize the expected utility of &lt;math&gt;U_i(a_i, b_j, c_i)&lt;/math&gt;

===Fairness model implications===
The fairness model implies that if player j is treating player i badly, if &lt;math&gt;f_j(b_j, c_i) &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then player i wishes to treat player j badly as well by choosing an action, a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, that is low or negative.  However, if player j is treating player i kindly, &lt;math&gt;f_j(b_j, c_i) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then player i will act kindly towards player j, as well (For more in depth examples see Rabin (1993)).

==Welfare and fairness: an application==
Rabin also used the fairness model as a utility function to determine [[social welfare]]. Rabin used a game theory "Grabbing Game" which posited that there are two people shopping, with two cans of soup left.  The payoffs for each are given as follows, where player i's payoffs are on the left of each pair and player j's payoffs are on the right of each pair:

{| class="wikitable"
!             !! Grab   !! Share
|-
|  '''Grab''' ||  x, x  || 2x, 0
|-
| '''Share''' ||  0, 2x ||  x, x
|}

If both grab or both share, each player i and j get one can of soup.  However, one grabs, and the other does not, then the person who grabbed gets both cans of soup.  There is a [[Nash Equilibrium]] present of (grab, grab).  Moreover, applying Rabin's fairness model (grab, grab) will always be a fairness equilibrium but for small values of x the cooperative choice (share, share) will Pareto dominate (grab, grab).  The reasoning behind this is that if the two people both grab for and therefore fight over the cans, the angriness and bad tempers that arise are likely to outweigh the importance of receiving the cans.  Therefore, while (Grab, Grab) and (Share, Share) are fairness equilibria when material payoffs are small, (Share, Share) will dominate (Grab, Grab) since people are affected by the kindness, which increases utility, or unkindness, which decreases utility, of others.  This example could be generalized further to describe the allocation of public goods.&lt;ref&gt;Souten, J., DeCremer, D., &amp; van Dijk, Erik. 2006. "[https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/_pdf/Stouten2006VEISD.pdf Violating Equality in Social Dilemmas: Emotional and Retributive Reactions as a Function of Trust, Attribution, and Honesty]." ''Personality &amp; social psychology bulletin. 32,'' 894-906.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public goods provision and fairness===
Stouten (2006) further generalized the principle of fairness to be applied to the provision of public goods. He and his colleagues ran three experiments to find how participants reacted when one member of their group violated the equality rule, which states that all group members will coordinate to equally and fairly contribute to the efficient provision of public goods. Their findings demonstrated that the participants believed that the equality rule should be applied to others and therefore when one person violated this rule punishment was used against this person, in terms of negative reactions. Therefore, the equality rule applied in real life situations should lead to the efficient provision of public goods if violations of the important coordination and fairness rules can be detected. However, often these violations cannot be detected which then leads to the [[free rider problem]] and an under-provision of public goods.

'''Radicalization''' (or '''radicalisation''') is a process by which an individual, or group comes to adopt increasingly [[Extremism|extreme]] political, social, or religious ideals and aspirations that reject or undermine the [[status quo]] or contemporary ideas and expressions of the nation. The outcomes of radicalization are shaped by the ideas of the society at large; for example, radicalism can originate from a broad social consensus against progressive changes in society or from a broad desire for change in society. Radicalization can be both violent and nonviolent, although most academic literature focuses on radicalization into [[violent extremism]] (RVE).&lt;ref&gt;Borum, Randy. Radicalization into Violent Extremism I: A Review of Social Science Theories. Journal of Strategic Security. Vol. 4 Issue 4. (2011) pp. 7–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Schmid, A. P. | title="Radicalisation, De-Radicalisation, Counter-Radicalisation: A Conceptual Discussion and Literature Review" | url=https://icct.nl/publication/radicalisation-de-radicalisation-counter-radicalisation-a-conceptual-discussion-and-literature-review/ | publisher= The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism – The Hague (ICCT)}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple pathways that constitute the process of radicalization, which can be independent but are usually mutually reinforcing.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, C., Mosalenko, S. "Mechanisms of political radicalization: Pathways towards terrorism," Terrorism and Political Violence (2008). 416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Radicalization: A Guide for the Perplexed. National Security Criminal Investigations. June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radicalization that occurs across multiple reinforcing pathways greatly increases a group’s resilience and lethality. Furthermore, by compromising its ability to blend in with non-radical society and participate in a modern, national economy, radicalization serves as a kind of sociological trap that gives individuals no other place to go to satisfy their material and spiritual needs.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Eli. Radical, Religious, and Violent: The New Economics of Terrorism. MIT Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

There is no universally accepted definition of radicalization. Therefore, no one definition can be presented here. One of the difficulties with defining radicalization appears to be the importance of the context to determine what is perceived as radicalization. Therefore, radicalization can mean different things to different people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Schmid, A. P. | title=Radicalisation, De-Radicalisation, Counter-Radicalisation: A Conceptual Discussion and Literature Review | url=https://icct.nl/publication/radicalisation-de-radicalisation-counter-radicalisation-a-conceptual-discussion-and-literature-review/ | publisher= The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism – The Hague (ICCT)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presented below is a list of definitions used by different governments.

===United Kingdom===

The [[UK Home Office]], [[MI5|MI5’s]] parent agency, defines radicalization as “The process by which people come to support [[terrorism]] and violent extremism and, in some cases, then join terrorist groups.” The MI5 report closes by saying that no single measure will reduce radicalization in the UK and that the only way to combat it is by targeting the at risk vulnerable groups and trying to assimilate them into society. This may include helping young people find jobs, better integrating immigrant populations into the local culture, and effectively reintegrating ex-prisoners into society.&lt;ref&gt;Behavioural Science Operational Briefing Note: Understanding radicalization and violent extremism in the UK. Report BSU 02/2008. Retrieved at: http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/20/uksecurity.terrorism1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] defines radicalization as "the process by which individuals—usually young people—are introduced to an overtly ideological message and belief system that encourages movement from moderate, mainstream beliefs towards extreme views. While radical thinking is by no means problematic in itself, it becomes a threat to national security when Canadian citizens or residents espouse or engage in violence or direct action as a means of promoting political, ideological or religious extremism. Sometimes referred to as “homegrown terrorism,” this process of radicalization is more correctly referred to as domestic radicalization leading to terrorist violence.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Radicalization: A Guide for the Perplexed. National Security System (NSS). June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;”

===Denmark===
The [[Danish Security and Intelligence Service]] (PET) defines radicalization as “A process by which a person to an increasing extent accepts the use of undemocratic or violent means, including terrorism, in an attempt to reach a specific political/ideological objective.”&lt;ref&gt;PET, “Radikalisering og terror” Center for Terroranalyse (Denmark) October 2009. Available at http://www.pet.dk/upload/radikalisering{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} og terror.pdf”&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diversity and commonalities ==

Despite being composed of multifarious pathways that lead to different outcomes and sometimes diametrically opposed ideological purposes, radicalization can be traced to a common set of pathways that translate real or perceived grievances into increasingly extreme ideas and readiness to participate in political action beyond the status quo. Shira Fishman, a researcher at the [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]], wrote "Radicalization is a dynamic process that varies for each individual, but shares some underlying commonalities that can be explored."&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, Shira., et al. UMD START: Community-Level Indicators of Radicalization: A Data and Methods Task Force. 16 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are many end products of the process of radicalization, to include all manner of extremist groups both violent and nonviolent, a common series of dynamics have been consistently demonstrated in the course of academic inquiry.

==Islamic radicalization==
[[Jihadis]] have a "tried and tested model" of contact with different [[Vulnerability|vulnerable]], and [[extremist]] individuals through online messaging services or [[social media]] platforms, and then rapidly manipulating them towards participating in violent action in their name.&lt;ref name="Jones2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Sam|last2=Wright|first2=Robert|title=Police probe how family man Khalid Masood became a violent zealot|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c20027e8-0ff3-11e7-a88c-50ba212dce4d|accessdate=March 24, 2017|publisher=Financial Times|date=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that [[Raffia Hayat]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim association]] warned that jailed extremists attempt to recruit violent criminals into radical groups so they carry out attacks on the public once released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Vincent|title=British Muslim leader says May MUST crack down on prison radicalisation to beat terror|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/783721/Khalid-Masood-Prison-Radicalised-Theresa-May-jihadi-Ahmadiyya-Muslim-Association|accessdate=March 26, 2017|agency=Sunday Express|date=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several notable criticisms of radicalization theories for focusing disproportionately on Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kundnani |first1=Arun |date=2012 |title=Radicalization: the journey of a concept |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306396812454984 |journal=Race &amp; Class |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=3–25 |doi=10.1177/0306396812454984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been concerns that converts to Islam are more susceptible to violent radicalization than individuals born into the faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/westminster-london-terror-attack-terrorist-khalid-masood-convert-muslim-islam-extremism-a7647626.html|title=Why are converts to Islam more likely to become extremists?|date=2017-03-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/muslim-converts-vulnerable-radicalisation-extremism-terror-attacks-isis-henry-jackson-society-report-a8017981.html|title=Muslim converts 'vulnerable to Isis radicalisation', research finds|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2017/04/01/converts-to-islam-are-likelier-to-radicalise-than-native-muslims|title=Converts to Islam are likelier to radicalise than native Muslims|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Abdul Haqq Baker developed the '''Convert's Cognitive Development Framework''' that describes how new converts conceptualize Islam and the stages where they are most vulnerable to radicalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/709890472|title=Extremists in our midst : confronting terror|last=1966-|first=Baker, Abdul Haqq,|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=|isbn=9780230296541|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|pages=12|oclc=709890472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual aid==

[[Eli Berman]]'s 2009 book ''Radical, Religious, and Violent: the New Economics of Terrorism''&lt;ref&gt;Radical, Religious and Violent: The New Economics of Terrorism (MIT Press 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; applies a [[rational choice]] model to the process of radicalization, demonstrating that the presence of [[mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]] networks increase the [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]] of radical groups. When those groups decide to use violence, they also enjoy a heightened level of lethality and are protected from [[defection]] and other forms of intervention by states and outside groups.

All organizations insofar as they include the possibility of [[free rider problem|free riders]] by extension experience defection constraints. Within the context of a violent extremist organization, defection means either defection to a [[counterintelligence]] or [[security]] apparatus, or defection to a non-radical [[criminal]] apparatus. Both of these outcomes spoil specific plans to exercise violence in the name of the group at large. The “defection constraint” is similar to a [[threshold price-point]] in that it denotes what rewards would justify the defection of any one individual within the context of an [[organization]]. Berman uses the example of a Taliban protection racket for convoys of consumer goods moving through Afghanistan: checkpoints are set up at several points along a trade route, and each checkpoint’s team is given a small percentage of the convoy’s total value if it arrives safely at its destination. The incentive for any one checkpoint’s team deciding to simply hijack a convoy as it passes through, sell the goods off, and escape, increases as the value of the convoy increases. The same dynamic applies to attacks; while an individual in a terrorist group may not feel drawn by the reward of alerting the police to an impending low level crime, the reward for alerting the police to an impending high-profile attack, such as a mass bombing, becomes more attractive. While non-radicalized and criminal organizations can only rely on organizational cohesion through a calculus of greed, fear, and perhaps familial loyalty, Berman argues that religious radicalization greatly increases the defection constraints of radical terrorist organizations by requiring outsized demonstrations of commitment to the cause prior to recruiting operatives.

Mutual aid is the voluntary and reciprocal exchange of goods within an organization. Examples in various religious antecedents include Judaic [[Tzedakah]], Islamic [[Zakat]], and various Christian institutions of charity, as described in the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. Berman argues that religious organizations experience economic risks by extending mutual aid to all alleged believers—theological assent is cheap, action can be costly. By imposing a series of outwardly visible social rules, such as restrictions (or prescriptions) on dress, diet, language, and social interactions, groups impose a cost on entering into a mutual aid partnership, diminishing the occurrence of free riding.

These restrictions have a dual effect in radical groups. Not only do they ensure that an individual is committed to the cause, but they also diminish individual’s access to consumption opportunities and social interaction that might persuade them to distance themselves from the cause. As individuals become more involved with radical activities, their social circles become more constrained, which diminishes contact with non-radicalized persons and further entrenches radicalized thinking. For example, when a young man spends several years in a Yeshiva in order to establish himself within a [[Haredi]] community, he foregoes future earnings that would be accessible should he choose a secular education. To quote Berman “As consumption opportunities are limited, work for pay becomes less appealing, freeing up even more time for community activities.” This [[sunk cost]] figures into future calculations, and raises the defection constraint in a way that non-radicalized group dynamics cannot. Going back to the Taliban convoy example, not only have the two footsoldiers in question have been [[vetted]] by demonstrating commitment to the cause, they also have had their exterior options limited such that it would be difficult to blend into a new environment for lack of skills and cultural understanding. As such, the threshold price point to defect, as represented by the value of the convoy, increases to include both the price of losing their existing support network and non-quantifiable factors such as friends, family, safety, and other goods over the course of their lives.

==Individual pathways==

While the overall arch of radicalization usually involves multiple, reinforcing processes, scholars have identified a series of individual pathways to radicalization. Clark McCauley and Sofia Mosalenko’s 2009 book ''Friction: How Radicalization Happens to Them and Us'' identifies the following sociological and psychodynamic pathways:

===Individual-level factors===

==== Personal grievance ====
This pathway emphasizes revenge for real or perceived harm inflicted upon oneself by an outside party. This initial offense triggers other psychodynamic mechanisms, such as thinking in more stark in-group and out-group terms, lowered inhibitions to violence, and lessened incentives to avoid violence. Chechen “[[Shahidka]]” also known as Black Widows, women who have lost husbands, children, or other close family members in conflict with Russian forces are a good example.

==== Group grievance ====
"Group grievance" radicalization dynamics are similar to those that are primed by personal grievances; the difference is that the subject perceives harm inflicted on a group that she belongs to or has sympathy for. This pathway accounts for the larger portion of political and ethnic radical violence, in which action is taken on behalf of the group at large rather than as an act of personal revenge. Radicalization out of sympathy for an outgroup is rarer, but can be observed in the Weather Underground's attempted alignment with the [[Black Panthers]] and [[Viet Cong]]. The tie between radicalization into [[violent extremism]] through group grievance and [[suicide bombing]] has also been quantifiably demonstrated: perceived threats to proximal identity such as the presence of foreign troops or invasion accounts for the majority of suicide bombings.&lt;ref&gt;Pape, Robert., Feldman, James. ''Cutting the Fuse: The Explosion of Global Suicide Terrorism and How to Stop It''. University of Chicago Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Slippery slope ====
The "Slippery slope" represents gradual radicalization through activities that incrementally narrow the individual’s social circle, narrow their mindset, and in some cases desensitize them to violence. This has also been called the “True Believer” syndrome, as a product of which one becomes increasingly serious about their political, social, and religious beliefs as a product of “taking the next step”. One can begin by participating in nonviolent activities such as mutual aid, wherein the best way to raise one’s in-group social status is to demonstrate seriousness about the cause and increase the level of commitment in terms of beliefs and activities. As an individual commits act after act, sunk costs are developed. Even if activity is initially only ideological or only criminal, the process of radicalization conflates the two such that criminal acts are justified for intellectually radical purposes, and radical purposes are invoked to justify what are ultimately criminal acts.&lt;ref&gt;Post, Jerrold. "Notes on a Psychodynamic Theory of Terrorist Behavior," in ''Terrorism: An International Journal'' Vol. 7 No. 3. 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Love ====
Romantic and familial entanglement is often an overlooked factor in radicalization. Several violent extremist organizations, especially at their origin, owe their structure to a tight-knit group of friends who share religious, economic, social, and sexual bonds. While this example is evident in more extreme cases, such as those of [[Charles Manson]]'s "Family" and other radical [[cult]]s, it also applies to radicalization in secular and orthodox religious environments. Love can serve as a connection between influential figures, connecting their networks of followers through a combination of attraction and loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Della Porta, D. Social movements, political violence, and the state: A comparative analysis of Italy and Germany. Cambridge University Press. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This particular force was especially notable in [[New Left]] radical groups, such as the American [[Weather Underground]] and the German [[Red Army Faction]]. The connections between [[Bill Ayers]] and [[Bernardine Dohrn]], or between [[Gudrun Ensslin]] and [[Andreas Baader]] served as the organizational and intellectual nucleus of these groups.

==== Risk and status ====
Within a radical group, high-risk behavior, if successful, offers a pathway to status insofar as it becomes re-construed as bravery and commitment to the cause. As such, violence or other radical activity provides a pathway to success, social acceptance, and physical rewards that might otherwise be out of reach. {{quotation | Disproportionate involvement in risk taking and status seeking is particularly true of those young men who come from disadvantaged family backgrounds, have lower IQ levels, are of lower socioeconomic status, and who therefore have less opportunity to succeed in society along a traditional career path. These young men are more likely to be involved in gang activity, violent crime, and other high-risk behavior.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, C. Mosalenko, S. Friction: How Radicalization Happens to Them and Us. Oxford University press 2009. pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;}}

James Pugel conducted a study, in which Liberian ex-combatants, indicated their motivations to become radicalized were based on the opportunity to increase their economic and social status within their community. There was a belief that radicalized individuals lived better than non-radicalized individuals. Specifically, extremists groups offered compensatory employment, which provided the means for basic needs to be met such as food and housing.In addition, radicalization provided protection and safety from local violence (i.e. abductions) for their entire family. All of which are contributory to the notion of an elevated economic and social status within the community.&lt;ref&gt;Pugel, James. "What the Fighters Say: A Survey of Ex-combatants in Liberia: February - March 2006". United Nations Development Programme, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers such as Alpaslan Ozerdem and Sukanya Podder contend that radicalization “can become the only route to survival, offering protection from torture, abuse, and politically instigated killing."&lt;ref&gt;Ozerdem, Alpaslan and Sukanya Podder. "Youth Radicalization and Violent Extremism". Journal of Strategic Security, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting that in some cases, individuals that did not join, were subjected to an indefinite “insufferable social burden that included demeaning names and labels".&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Robert. "Interviews with Killers: Six Types of Combatants and Their Motivations for Joining Deadly Groups". Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unfreezing ====
Loss of social connection can open an individual to new ideas and a new identity that may include political radicalization. Isolated from friends, family, or other basic needs, individuals may begin to associate with unlike parties, to include political, religious, or cultural radicals. This is especially noted in ''prison radicalization'', where individuals bind together over racial, religious, and gang identity to a greater degree than in the outside world and often bring their newfound radical identity beyond prison to connect with radical organizations in the populace at large.&lt;ref&gt;Fighel, John. "The Radicalization Process in Prisons", ''International Institute for Counterterrorism''. presented at NATO workshop, Eliat, 25 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Additional Pathways ====
Robert Barrett is one of the leading researchers in field research with Nigerian terrorist groups. Barrett contributes a unique perspective to this type of research because his studies are conducted with current, not former, members of insurgent groups. Barrett’s 2008 field research study revealed unique typologies and motivations for radicalization as reported by insurgent groups. For instance, individuals that were radicalized expressed sentiments of volunteerism, yet extremist recruiters conveyed that their objective was to make “coercion feel like volunteerism.” Barrett asserted that the motivations to become radicalized can be characterized as: ideologue, combatant, criminals, pragmatist, soldier, and follower.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Robert. "Interviews with Killers: Six Types of Combatants and Their Motivations for Joining Deadly Groups". Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideologues uphold a belief that ethnic supremacy is necessary and violence was the means to achieve this truth. Ideologues maintain a “readiness to die for the ethnic group if necessary; survival and preservation of the group or community is more important than survival or preservation of oneself”.

Combatants’ express concerns that their basic survival depends on joining extremist groups. Hence, combatants are not motivated by ideologies and their primary objective is self-preservation.

Criminals are predominantly motivated by their “freedom to carry out activities that would otherwise be deemed illegal”. As such, criminals thrive on instant self-gratification of engaging in violent acts against their enemies. Criminals thrive on conflict and in a sense believe their actions are heroic.

Pragmatists are interested in the benefits of economic and social status mobility. Their goals are in “preserving the structures and environment conducive to either continued success or to newfound success” in wealth, land ownership, and/or mining rights.

Soldiers believe “injustice and insecurity” are mitigating factors for radicalization. Prominent feelings that they have a duty to fight against injustices. Soldiers are motivated by a sense that they can instrumentally affect positive change.

Followers desire a sense of group dependence and attachment to overcome feelings of being an outsider. They are overwhelmingly concerned with social perception. “Ensuring one’s acceptance and preserving or enhancing one’s social status within the community was the most important factor promoting membership”.

===Group-level factors===

Insofar as a group is a dynamic system with a common goal or set of values it is possible that the group’s mindset as a whole can affect individuals such that those individuals become more radical.

==== Polarization ====
Discussion, interaction, and experience within a radical group can result in an aggregate increase in commitment to the cause, and in some cases can contribute to the formation of divergent conceptions of the group’s purpose and preferred tactics. Within a radical group, internal dynamics can contribute to the formation of different factions as a result of internal disillusionment (or, conversely, ambitions) with the group’s activities as a whole, especially when it comes to a choice between violent terrorism and nonviolent activism. The [[Weather Underground]]’s split with [[Students for a Democratic Society]] is one of many examples. The dynamics of group polarization imply that members of this larger group must either commit to one faction and demonstrate their loyalty through further radicalization, or leave the group entirely.

==== Isolation ====
Isolation reinforces the influence of radical thinking by allowing serious and or persuasive members of the group to disproportionately define the body's agenda. When an individual only has access to one in-group social environment, that group gains a totalizing influence over the individual—disapproval would be tantamount to social death, personal isolation, and often a lack of access to the basic services that mutual aid communities fulfill. As an isolated minority, Islamic groups in the West are especially vulnerable to this form of radicalization. Being cut off from society at large through [[language barrier]]s, cultural difference, and occasionally [[discriminatory]] treatment, Muslim communities become more vulnerable to additional pathways of radicalization&lt;ref&gt;Vidino, Lorenzo. ''Countering Radicalization in America: Lessons from Europe''. United States institute of Peace Special Report, Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

One such additional pathway of radicalization of individuals that feel isolated is the Internet. Utilizing data compiled by the Internet World Stats, Robin Thompson contends that the Middle East and North Africa rate of Internet usage is “above average” in comparison to other countries, yet in countries where Internet availability is more widespread, individuals are “more likely to be recruited and radicalized via the Internet.” Hence, the Internet, specifically social media sites such as extremists’ chat rooms and blogs, “lures its users with a promise of friendship, acceptance, or a sense of purpose.”&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Robin L. "Radicalization and the Use of Social Media". Journal of Strategic Security, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Competition ====
Groups can become radicalized vis-a-vis other groups as they compete for [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and prestige with the general populace. This pathway emphasizes increased radicalization in an effort to outdo other groups, whether that increase is in violence, time spent in religious ritual, economic and physical hardship endured, or all four. Religious movements and the terrorist elements that form in their name display this characteristic. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} While in some cases there may be [[doctrinal]] or [[ethnic]] differences that motivate this kind of competition, its greatest outward sign is an increased demand by the group for commitment to radical actions. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Mass radicalization===
[[File:Mao1938a.jpg|thumb|right|Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] writing ''On Protracted War'' in 1938.]]

==== Jujitsu politics ====
Also called "the logic of political violence", Jiujitsu politics is a form of [[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetrical]] [[political warfare]] in which radical groups act to provoke governments to crack down on the populace at large and produce domestic blowback that legitimates further violent action.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, C. Jiutitsu Politics: Terrorism and response to terrorism. In P.R. Kimmel &amp; Chris Stout (Eds.), ''Collateral Damage: The psychological consequences of America's War on Terrorism''&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose of a radical group using this tactic is not to destroy the enemy outright, but to make the enemy strike at political and ideological moderates, such that the existing political order loses its claim on [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] while the radical group gains legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Rosebraugh, Craig. The Logic of Political Violence. PW Press. Portland, OR. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; By destroying moderates, radical groups encourage a bifurcated society and use state's reactions to violence as a justification for further violence.&lt;ref&gt;Marighella, C. Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla. J. Butt and R. Sheed (trans.) Havana, Transcontinental Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Al-Qaeda]]'s strategy of luring the West, specifically the [[United States]], into ground wars in Islamic states that polarize the [[Ummah]] against the West while avoiding engagements that would allow the American military to draw on its technical superiority is an example of jiujitsu politics. [[David Kilcullen]], Counterinsurgency advisor to [[David Petraeus]] during the [[Iraq Surge]], has called this the "accidental guerrilla syndrome".&lt;ref&gt;KilCullen, David. ''The Accidental Guerrilla: Fighting Small Wars in the Midst of a Big One''. Oxford University Press. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

This tactic is also pillar of [[Maoist]] [[insurgency]] and serves both the purposes of tactical and ideological advantage.

==== Hatred ====
In protracted conflicts the enemy is increasingly seen as less human,&lt;ref&gt;Royzman, E.E., McCauley, C., Rozin, P. From Plato to Putnam: Four ways of thinking about hate. In R.J. Sternberg (ed.) ''The Psychology of Hate'' pp. 3–35. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; such that their common humanity does not readily trigger natural inhibitions against violence. This involves "essentializing" both the self and enemies as respectively good and evil entities. The Islamist use of [[Takfirism]], or ([[apostasy]]), to justify the murder of non-radical Muslims and nonbelievers (''[[kafir]]'': "pagans") is an example of this. [[Hannah Arendt]], in [[The Origins of Totalitarianism]] outlines a similar dynamic that contributed to the ideologies of [[pan-slavism]], [[Nazism]], and [[antisemitism]], where an [[in-group]] constructs an exalted [[self identity]] for political purposes and mobilizes against out-groups in order to solidify that identity.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah. ''The Origins of Totalitarianism''. Schocken Books. 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; This dynamic of hatred is not unique to [[rightist]] groups. The Weathermen and Red Army Faction often characterized police officers and government officials as “pigs” worthy of death and subhuman treatment.

==== Martyrdom ====
[[Martyrdom]] implies that the person in question died for a cause or is willing to die for a cause. The symbolic impact of martyrdom varies across cultures, but within the field of radicalization the act or pursuit of martyrdom denotes the absolute value of a radical’s way of life.

==Misconceptions==

=== Poverty ===
The association between radicalization and poverty is a myth. Many terrorists come from middle-class backgrounds and have university-level educations, particularly in the technical sciences and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17730424 |title=Exploding misconceptions |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=16 December 2010 |website=The Economist |access-date=7 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no statistical association between poverty and militant radicalization.&lt;ref&gt;Baylouni, A.M. ''Emotion, Poverty, or Politics? Misconceptions About radical Islamist Movements''. Connections III, No. 1, Vol. 4. pp. 41–47 Available at: http://faculty.nps.edu/ambaylou/baylouny%20emotions%20poverty%20politics.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; As outlined above, poverty and disadvantage may incentivize joining a mutual aid organization with radical tendencies, but this does not mean that poverty proper is responsible for radicalization.

=== Mental illness ===
Though personal psychology does play a significant part in radicalization, mental illness is not a root cause of terrorism specifically or ideological radicalization broadly. Even in the case of [[suicide terrorism]], psychological pathologies, such as depression and [[schizophrenia]] are largely absent.&lt;ref&gt;Pape, Robert. ''Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism''. Random House. 2005. https://www.amazon.com/Dying-Win-Strategic-Suicide-Terrorism/dp/1400063175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pape, Robert., Feldman, James.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1150">In [[statistical quality control]], the '''regression control chart''' allows for monitoring a change in a process where two or more variables are [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]]. The change in a [[dependent variable]] can be detected and compensatory change in the [[independent variable]] can be recommended.

Regression control chart differs from a traditional [[control chart]] in four main aspects:
# It is designed to control a varying (rather than a constant) average.
# The control limit lines are parallel to the regression line rather than the horizontal line.
# The computations here are much more complex.
# It is appropriate for use in more complex situations. &lt;ref name="mandel"/&gt;

[[File:Zn_sila_logos.svg|thumb|180px|Logos science magazine [[:ru:Знание — сила|''Znanie — sila'']] ([[USSR]]/[[Russia]]) - in translation "Knowledge is power".]]
The phrase "'''''scientia potentia est'''"'' (or "'''''scientia est potentia'''''" or also "'''''scientia potestas est'''")'' is a [[Latin]] [[aphorism]] meaning "knowledge is power".  It is commonly attributed to [[Sir Francis Bacon]], although there is no known occurrence of this precise phrase in Bacon's English or Latin writings. However, the expression "''ipsa scientia potestas est"'' ('knowledge itself is power') occurs in Bacon's ''Meditationes Sacrae'' (1597). The exact phrase "''scientia potentia est"'' was written for the first time in the 1668 version of the work ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes]], who was secretary to Bacon as a young man.

The related phrase "''sapientia est potentia"'' is often translated as "wisdom is power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2004/f/speciale/altri/2004censis/dariofo/dariofo.html|title=Knowledge like challenge to every form of powers|author=Dario Fo|website=repubblica.it|date=June 13, 2004|language=italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins and parallels===

The earliest documented occurrence of the phrase "Knowledge is power" is from Imam [[Ali]] (599-661 CE), as recorded in the tenth-century book [[Nahj Al-Balagha]] (originally in Arabic). He said:

{{Quote|text=Knowledge is power and it can command obedience. A man of knowledge during his lifetime can make people obey and follow him and he is praised and venerated after his death. Remember that knowledge is a ruler and wealth is its subject.|sign=[[Imam Ali]]|source=''[[Nahj Al-Balagha]]'', Saying 146}}

Another account of this concept is found in the [[Shahnameh]] by the Persian poet [[Ferdowsi]] (940–1020 CE) who wrote: "Capable is he who is wise" (in [[Persian language|Persian]]: توانا بود هر که دانا بود).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shahnameh, first poem, couplet 14. توانا بود هر که دانا بود ز دانش دل پیر برنا بود knowledge is power with the knowledge, the heart of the old people will be young (Ferdowsi)  e.f.|url=http://shahnameh.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[hemistich]] is translated to English as "knowledge is power" or "One who has wisdom is powerful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.persianmirror.com/Article_det.cfm?id=1425&amp;getArticleCategory=59&amp;getArticleSubCategory=35 |title=The Modern Magazine for Persian Weddings, Cuisine, Culture &amp; Community |publisher=Persianmirror.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307171627/http://www.persianmirror.com/Article_det.cfm?id=1425&amp;getArticleCategory=59&amp;getArticleSubCategory=35 |archivedate=2012-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proverb in practically the same wording is found in Hebrew, in the Biblical [[Book of Proverbs]] (24:5): גֶּבֶר-חָכָם בַּעוֹז;    וְאִישׁ-דַּעַת, מְאַמֶּץ-כֹּחַ. This was translated in the latin [[Vulgata]] as "''vir sapiens et fortis est et vir doctus robustus et validus''"&lt;ref&gt;Biblia Sacra Vulgata, [https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Biblia_Sacra_Vulgata_%28Stuttgartensia%29/Proverbia  Proverbia]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[King James Version]], the first English official edition, as "A wise man is strong, a man of knowledge increaseth strength".&lt;ref&gt;Holy Bible, King James Version, [http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1611-Bible/book.php?book=Proverbs&amp;chapter=24&amp;verse=5 Proverbs 24:5]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Hobbes===
&lt;!--The Latin phrase "Scientia potentia est" does not appear at all in''De Homine'' (1658), chapter X. Instead, it does appear Leviathan (1668), section De Homine (of man), chapter X. --&gt;
The first known reference of the exact phrase appeared in the Latin edition of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1668; the English version had been published in 1651). This passage from Part 1 ("De Homine"), Chapter X ("De Potentia, Dignitate et Honore") occurs in a list of various attributes of man which constitute power; in this list, "sciences" or "the sciences" are given a minor position:
{{quote|''Scientia potentia est, sed parva; quia scientia egregia rara est, nec proinde apparens nisi paucissimis, et in paucis rebus. Scientiae enim ea natura est, ut esse intelligi non possit, nisi ab illis qui sunt scientia praediti''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Opera philosophica...'', [https://archive.org/details/operaphilosophi03molegoog Volume III] (''Leviathan'' [1668]), [https://archive.org/stream/operaphilosophi03molegoog#page/n80/mode/2up p. 69]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the English version this passage reads as thus:
{{quote|''The sciences are small powers; because not eminent, and therefore, not acknowledged in any man; nor are at all, but in a few, and in them, but of a few things. For science is of that nature, as none can understand it to be, but such as in a good measure have attained it.''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury...'', [https://archive.org/details/englishworkstho10hobbgoog Volume 3] (Leviathan), [https://archive.org/stream/englishworkstho10hobbgoog#page/n90/mode/2up p. 75].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
   
On a later work, ''[[De Corpore]]'' (1655), also written in Latin, Hobbes expanded the same idea:
{{quote|''The end or scope of philosophy is, that we may make use to our benefit of effects formerly seen ... for the commodity of human life ... The end of knowledge is power ... lastly, the scope of all speculation is the performing of some action, or thing to be done.''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes ''De Corpore'', Part I, Chapter I (''On Phylosophy''). In Thomas Hobbes, ''The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury...'', [https://archive.org/details/englishworkstho21hobbgoog Volume I], [https://archive.org/stream/englishworkstho21hobbgoog#page/n32/mode/2up p. 7]. From the Latin edition: Thomas Hobbes, ''Opera philosophica...'', [https://archive.org/details/operaphilosophi04molegoog Volume 1], [https://archive.org/stream/operaphilosophi04molegoog#page/n132/mode/2up p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In Jean Hampton, ''Hobbes and the social contract tradition'' (1988), Hampton indicates that this quote is 'after Bacon' and in a footnote, that 'Hobbes was Bacon's secretary as a young man and had philosophical discussions with him (Aubrey 1898, 331).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayinsci.com/H/Hobbes_Thomas/HobbesThomas-Quotations.htm |title=Thomas Hobbes Quotes - 14 Science Quotes - Dictionary of Science Quotations and Scientist Quotes |publisher=Todayinsci.com |date=2012-01-19 |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Francis Bacon===
[[Image:Francis Bacon 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sir Francis Bacon]], "''ipsa scientia potestas est"'' (knowledge itself is power). ''Meditationes Sacrae'' (1597).]]
The closest expression in Bacon's works is, perhaps, the expression "''scientia potestas est''", found in his ''[[s:Meditationes sacrae|Meditationes Sacrae]]'' (1597), which is perhaps better translated as "knowledge is His power", because the context of the sentence refers to the qualities of God and is imbedded in a discussion of heresies that deny the power of God:
''statuuntque latiores terminos scientiae Dei quam potestatis, vel potius ejus partis potestatis Dei (nam et ipsa scientia potestas est) qua scit, quam ejus qua movet et agit: ut praesciat quaedam otiose, quae non praedestinet et praeordinet''.

The English translation of this section includes the following:

: "This canon is the mother of all canons against heresies. The cause of error is twofold : ignorance of the will of God, and ignorance or superficial consideration of the power of God. The will of God is more revealed through the Scriptures… his power more through his creatures… So is the plenitude of God’s power to be asserted, as not to involve any imputation upon his will. So is the goodness of his will to be asserted, as not to imply any derogation of his power. 
: "… Atheism and Theomachy rebels and mutinies against the power of God ; not trusting to his word, which reveals his will, because it does not believe in his power, to whom all things are possible… But of the heresies which deny the power of God, there are, besides simple atheism, three degrees…

: "The third degree is of those who limit and restrain the former opinion to human actions only, which partake of sin: which actions they suppose to depend substantively and without any chain of causes upon the inward will and choice of man; and who give a wider range to the knowledge of God than to his power; or rather to that part of God’s power (for knowledge itself is power) whereby he knows, than to that whereby he works and acts ; suffering him to fore know some things as an unconcerned looker on, which he does not predestine and preordain : a notion not unlike the figment which Epicurus introduced into the philosophy of Democritus, to get rid of fate and make room for fortune; namely the sidelong motion of the Atom; which has ever by the wiser sort been accounted a very {{nowrap|empty device." (pp.&amp;nbsp;94–95; ''Works of Bacon'',}} Vol XIV, Boston; Brown and Taggard, 1861)

Interpretation of the notion of power meant by Bacon must therefore take into account his distinction between the power of knowing and the power of working and acting, the opposite of what is assumed when the maxim is taken out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vickers|first=Brian|title=Francis Bacon and the Progress of Knowledge|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|year=1992|volume=53|issue=3|pages=495–518|jstor=2709891}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the quotation has become a [[cliche]].

In another place, Bacon wrote,  "Human knowledge and human power meet in one; for where the cause is not known the effect cannot be produced. Nature to be commanded must be obeyed; and that which in contemplation is as the cause is in operation as the rule."&lt;ref&gt;Francis Bacon, ''[[Novum Organum]]'', Part I, Aphorism III. Boston:  Taggard &amp; Thompson, 1863, volume  VIII, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ralph Waldo Emerson ===
[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote in his essay ''Old Age'', included in the collection ''Society and Solitude'' (1870):

{{quote|''Skill to do comes of doing; knowledge comes by eyes always open, and working hands; and there is no knowledge that is not power.''&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Waldo Emerson, ''Society and Solitude'', 1892, [https://archive.org/stream/acj9362.0001.001.umich.edu#page/302/mode/2up p. 303]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Wissen ist Macht in Germany ===
After the 1871, [[unification of Germany]], "''Wissen ist Macht, geographisches Wissen ist Weltmacht''" (Knowledge is power, geographical knowledge is world power) was often used in German geography and the public discussion to support efforts for a [[German colonial empire]] after 1880. [[Justus Perthes|Julius Perthes]] e.g., used the motto for his [[Justus Perthes (publishing company)|publishing house]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article638877/Geographie-als-Weltmacht.html | title=Geographie als Weltmacht  Klett und Perthes werben für ein "Museum der Erde" in Gotha | publisher=Die Welt | date=24 June 1997 | accessdate=29 August 2014 | author=ALEXANDER U.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially [[Count Otto von Bismarck|Count Bismarck]] was not much interested in German colonial adventures; his envoy [[Gustav Nachtigal]] started with the first protective areas, but was more interested in ethnological aspects.

After World War I, German geography tried to contribute to efforts to regain a world power. Scholars like [[Karl Haushofer]], a former general, and his son [[Albrecht Haushofer]] (both in close contact with Rudolf Hess) got worldwide attention with their concept of geopolitics. Associations of German geographers and school teachers welcomed the [[Machtergreifung]] and hoped to get further influence in the new regime.

The postwar geography was much more cautious; concepts of political geography and projection of power had not been widespread scholarly topics till 1989 in Germany.

Geographical knowledge is however still of importance in Germany. Germans tend to mock US politicians' and celebrities' comparable lack of interest in the topic. A Sponti ([[Außerparlamentarische Opposition]]) version of the slogan is "Wissen ist Macht, nichts wissen, macht auch nichts", a pun about the previous motto along the line "Knowledge is power, but being ignorant doesn't bother anyway". [[Joschka Fischer]] and [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] belong to those Spontis that nevertheless held powerful positions, in Fischer's case with no more formal education than a taxi driver's licence.

The German Bundeswehr Bataillon Elektronische Kampfführung 932, an [[electronic warfare]] unit based in [[Frankenberg (Eder)]], still uses the Latin version ''Scientia potentia est'' as its motto.

==Interpretation==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Though its meaning varies from author to author, the phrase often implies{{according to whom|date=February 2017}} that with knowledge or [[education]], one's potential or abilities in life will certainly increase. Having and sharing knowledge is widely recognized as the basis for improving one's reputation and influence, thus power. This phrase may also be used as a justification for a reluctance to share information when a person believes that withholding knowledge can deliver to that person some forms of advantage. Another interpretation is that the only true power is knowledge, as everything (including any achievement) is derived from it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3992">'''Social dangerousness''' or '''Pre-criminal danger to society''' is a legal charge under [[Cuban law]] which allows the authorities to detain people who they think are likely to commit crimes. The charge carries a penalty of up to four years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7583775.stm "Leading Cuban musician arrested"], ''BBC'', 27 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cuban government]] has been accused by [[Amnesty International]] of using the charge almost exclusively against critics of the government.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/Regions/Americas/Cuba |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909203943/http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/regions/americas/cuba |archivedate=2008-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the punk rock singer and dissident [[Gorki Águila]] was arrested by police on a charge of social dangerousness. He was eventually ordered to pay a $30 fine for the lesser offence of public disorder, after prosecutors dropped the charge of social dangerousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2007, political protester Ramón Velásquez was arrested for the charge of social dangerousness. Velásquez was participating in a march across Cuba that highlighted human rights violations and freedom for political prisoners. Velásquez was then tried in a closed hearing and sentenced to three years in prison. Velásquez was released in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/02/27/imprisoned-dangerousness-cuba|title=Imprisoned for 'Dangerousness' in Cuba|date=2010-02-27|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Cuban law defines dangerousness (el estado peligroso) as "the special proclivity of a person to commit crimes, demonstrated by conduct that is observed to be in manifest contradiction with the norms of socialist morality." ... If Cuba determines that someone is dangerous, the Criminal Code allows the state to impose "pre-criminal measures," including surveillance by the National Revolutionary Police and re-education for periods of one-to-four years. The state may detain the person during this time. The law also provides for "therapeutic measures," including detention in a psychiatric hospital, that are continued "until the dangerousness disappears from the subject." The open-ended nature of this punishment affords the state extraordinary authority to abuse the rights of political opponents and the developmentally disabled.|[[Human Rights Watch]] 1999 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/cuba/Cuba996-02.htm#P536_69587|title=II.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3948">'''Sociometer''' theory is a theory of [[self-esteem]] from an [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychological]] perspective that proposes that state [[self-esteem]] is a gauge (or sociometer) of interpersonal relationships. This theoretical perspective was first introduced by [[Mark Leary]] and colleagues in 1995&lt;ref&gt;Leary, M. R., &amp; Downs, D. L. (1995). Interpersonal functions of the self-esteem motive: The self-esteem system as a sociometer. In M. H. Kernis (Ed.), Efficacy, Agency, and Self-Esteem (pp. 123-144). New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leary, M. R., Tambor, E. S., Terdal, S. K., &amp; Downs, D. L. (1995). Self-esteem as an interpersonal monitor: The sociometer hypothesis. Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 68(3), 518-530.&lt;/ref&gt; and later expanded on by Kirkpatrick and Ellis.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, L. A., &amp; Ellis, B. J. (2001). An evolutionary-psychological approach to self-esteem: multiple domains and multiple functions. In G. J. O. Fletcher &amp; M. S. Clark (Eds.), Blackwell handbook of social psychology: Interpersonal processes (pp. 411-436). Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Leary’s research, the idea of self-esteem as a sociometer is discussed in depth. This theory was created as a response to psychological phenomenon i.e. social emotions, inter- and intra- personal behaviors, self-serving biases, and reactions to rejection. Based on this theory, self-esteem is a measure of effectiveness in social relations and interactions that monitors acceptance and/or rejection from others.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, M. R. (2005): Sociometer Theory and The Pursuit of Relational Value: Getting to the Root of Self-Esteem, ''European Review of Social Psychology'', 16, 75-111&lt;/ref&gt; With this, an emphasis is placed on relational value, which is the degree to which a person regards his or her relationship with another, and how it affects day-to-day life. Confirmed by various studies and research, if a person is deemed having relational value, they are more likely to have higher self-esteem. According to Leary, there are five main groups associated with relational value that are classified as those affording the greatest impact on an individual. They are: 1) macro-level, i.e., communities, 2) instrumental coalitions, i.e., teams, committees, 3) mating relationships, 4) kin relationships, and 5) friendships. A study was conducted to see just how much people depend on peers and outside factors and relational values to regulate their life. The objective of the study was to pick groups for an activity based on the evaluations given by the students.  In the study, two groups were assigned. Both groups consisted of college students that submitted and were subjected to a peer evaluation. The difference being that the control group of students chose if they 1) wanted to interact with the person or 2) dissociated from the person. Previously asked, some students stated that they were indifferent or did not care what others' opinions of them were. However, when results were analyzed there was a great deal of fluctuation in overall self-esteem. Those who were placed in the second group (of dissociation), receiving a low relational value, displayed a lowered self-esteem. As a result, this compromised the way they assessed a/the situation. In the first group, where perceived relational value was high, self-esteem was also high. This provides some evidence for an evolutionary basis in the fundamental human need for inclusion in a group, and the burden of being on the outskirts of social acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, M. R. (2005): Sociometer Theory and The Pursuit of Relational Value: Getting to the Root of Self-Esteem, ''European Review of Social Psychology'', 16, 75-111&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soft power''' is the ability to attract and [[Co-option|co-opt]], rather than [[coerce]] ([[hard power]]). Soft power is the ability to shape the preferences of others through appeal and attraction. A defining feature of soft power is that it is non-coercive; the currency of soft power is culture, political values, and foreign policies. Recently, the term has also been used in changing and influencing social and public opinion through relatively less transparent channels and [[lobbying]] through powerful political and non-political organizations. In 2012, [[Joseph Nye]] of [[Harvard University]] explained that with soft power, "the best [[propaganda]] is not propaganda", further explaining that during the [[Information Age]], "credibility is the scarcest resource."&lt;ref name=WSJmay2012&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nye |first1=Joseph |title=China's Soft Power Deficit To catch up, its politics must unleash the many talents of its civil society |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304451104577389923098678842 |accessdate=6 December 2014 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nye coined the term in a 1990 book, ''Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power''. In this book, he wrote: “when one country gets other countries to want what it wants-might be called co-optive or soft power in contrast with the hard or command power of ordering others to do what it wants.”&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 1990"&gt;Nye, Joseph.''Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power''(New York: Basic Books, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; He further developed the concept in his 2004 book, ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics''. The term is now widely used in international affairs by analysts and statesmen. For example, [[US Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] spoke of the need to enhance American soft power by "a dramatic increase in spending on the civilian instruments of [[national security]] – [[diplomacy]], [[strategic communications]], foreign assistance, civic action and [[economic reconstruction]] and development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |author=Robert M.

According to the Soft Power 30, an annual index published by [[Portland Communications]] and the [[USC Center on Public Diplomacy]] for 2018, the [[United Kingdom]] is the leading sovereign state in soft power. Other leading countries in soft power include [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Switzerland]], [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McClory|first=Jonathan|title=''The Soft Power 30: A Global Ranking of Soft Power, 2017''|url=http://softpower30.portland-communications.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-Soft-Power-30-Report-2017-Web-1.pdf|date=18 July 2017|publisher=Portland|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2016/17 [[Monocle (UK magazine)|''Monocle'']] Soft Power Survey, ranks the United States as the leading country in soft power.

== Description ==
[[File:Soft Power (2004) by Joseph Nye.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph Nye's 2004 book describing the concept of "soft power"]]

[[Joseph Nye]] introduced the concept of "soft power" in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Power-Means-Success-Politics/dp/1586482254/&lt;/ref&gt; For Nye, power is the ability to influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes you want. There are several ways one can achieve this: you can coerce them with threats; you can induce them with payments; or you can attract and co-opt them to want what you want. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes you want – co-opts people rather than coerces them.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 1990"/&gt;

It can be contrasted with '[[hard power]]', which is the use of coercion and payment. Soft power can be wielded not just by states but also by all actors in international politics, such as [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] or international institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Nye, ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics''&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered the "second face of power" that indirectly allows you to obtain the outcomes you want. A country's soft power, according to Nye, rests on three resources: "its culture (in places where it is attractive to others), its political values (when it lives up to them at home and abroad), and its foreign policies (when others see them as legitimate and having moral authority)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Future_of_Power.html?id=AH08y1Bi1Y0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"A country may obtain the outcomes it wants in world politics because other countries – admiring its values, emulating its example, aspiring to its level of prosperity and openness – want to follow it. In this sense, it is also important to set the agenda and attract others in world politics, and not only to force them to change by threatening military force or economic sanctions. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes that you want – co-opts people rather than coerces them."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Soft power resources are the assets that produce attraction which often leads to acquiescence.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004"/&gt; Nye asserts that, "Seduction is always more effective than coercion, and many values like democracy, human rights, and individual opportunities are deeply seductive."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004) p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angelo Codevilla]] observed that an often overlooked essential aspect of soft power is that different parts of populations are attracted or repelled by different things, ideas, images, or prospects.&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008"&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Soft power is hampered when policies, culture, or values repel others instead of attracting them.

In his book, Nye argues that soft power is a more difficult instrument for governments to wield than hard power for two reasons: many of its critical resources are outside the control of governments, and soft power tends to "work indirectly by shaping the environment for policy, and sometimes takes years to produce the desired outcomes."&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71"&gt;Lord, Carnes, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power,"in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008.) pp. 59–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The book identifies three broad categories of soft power: "culture", "political values", and "policies."

In ''The Future of Power'' (2011), Nye reiterates that soft power is a descriptive, rather than a normative, concept.&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 81"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, soft power can be wielded for nefarious purposes. "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Josef Stalin|Stalin]], and [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] all possessed a great deal of soft power in the eyes of their acolytes, but that did not make it good. It is not necessarily better to twist minds than to twist arms."&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 81" /&gt; Nye also claims that soft power does not contradict the international relations theory of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]]. "Soft power is not a form of idealism or liberalism. It is simply a form of power, one way of getting desired outcomes."&lt;ref name="The Future of Power 82"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_future_of_power.html?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations of the concept ==
{{+rs|date=March 2016}}
Soft power has been criticized as being ineffective by authors such as [[Niall Ferguson]] in the preface to ''Colossus''. [[Neorealism (international relations)|Neorealist]] and other rationalist and neorationalist authors (with the exception of [[Stephen Walt]]) dismiss soft power out of hand as they assert that actors in international relations respond to only two types of incentives: economic incentives and force.

As a concept, it can be difficult to distinguish between soft power from hard power. For example, Janice Bially Mattern argues that [[George W. Bush]]'s use of the phrase "you are either with us or with the terrorists" was in fact an exercise of hard power. Though military and economic force was not used to pressure other states to join its coalition, a kind of force – representational force – was used. This kind of force threatens the identity of its partners, forcing them to comply or risk being labelled as evil. This being the case, soft power is therefore not so soft.&lt;ref&gt;Janice Bially Mattern, "Why 'Soft Power' Isn't So Soft: Representational Force and the Sociolinguistic Construction of Attraction in World Politics," ''Millennium: Journal of International Studies'' 33, no. 3 (2005): 586.&lt;/ref&gt; However, rationalist authors{{Who|date=May 2013}} would merely see this as an 'implied threat', and that direct economic or military sanctions would likely follow from being 'against us'.

== Measurement ==
The first attempt to measure soft power through a composite index was created and published by the [[Institute for Government]] and the media company ''[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=McClory|title=The new persuaders: an international ranking of soft power|date=2010-12-07|publisher=Institute for Government|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications_download.php?id=20|work=Institute for Government website|page=13|accessdate=2011-05-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724053803/http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications_download.php?id=20|archivedate=2011-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IfG-Monocle Soft Power Index combined a range of statistical metrics and subjective panel scores to measure the soft power resources of 26 countries. The metrics were organized according to a framework of five sub-indices including culture, diplomacy, education, business/innovation, and government. The index is said to measure the soft power resources of countries, and does not translate directly into ability influence. ''Monocle'' has published an annual ''Soft Power Survey'' since then. As of 2016/17, the list is calculated using around 50 factors that indicate the use of soft power, including the number of cultural missions (primarily language schools), [[Olympic medals]], the quality of a country's [[architecture]] and business brands.&lt;ref name="monocle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://monocle.com/film/affairs/soft-power-survey-2016-17/|title=Soft Power Survey 2016/17|date=2016|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Soft Power 30'', which includes a foreword by Joseph Nye, is a ranking of countries' soft power produced and published by the media company ''Portland'' in 2015. The ranking is based on "the quality of a country’s political institutions, the extent of their cultural appeal, the strength of their diplomatic network, the global reputation of their higher education system, the attractiveness of their economic model, and a country’s digital engagement with the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Soft Power 30 - A Global Ranking of Soft Power|url=http://softpower30.portland-communications.com/pdfs/the_soft_power_30.pdf|publisher=Portland|accessdate=17 July 2015|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Softly does it|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21657655-oxbridge-one-direction-and-premier-league-bolster-britains-power-persuade-softly-does-it|accessdate=17 July 2015|work=The Economist|date=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In ‘soft power’ terms, Japan ranks eighth out of 30 countries in U.K. consultancy report|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/07/15/national/soft-power-terms-japan-ranks-eighth-30-u-k-consultancy-gauge/#.Value4u-ra4|accessdate=17 July 2015|work=Japan Times|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Elcano Global Presence Report'' scores the [[European Union]] first for soft presence when its member states are excluded and the EU is considered as a whole.&lt;ref name=ElcanoEU /&gt;

Soft power, then, represents the third behavioral way of getting the outcomes you want. Soft power is contrasted with hard power, which has historically been the predominant realist measure of national power, through [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] such as [[population]] size, concrete [[military]] assets, or a nation's [[gross domestic product]]. But having such resources does not always produce the desired outcomes, as the United States discovered in the Vietnam War. The extent of attraction can be measured by public opinion polls, by elite interviews, and case studies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Nye argues that soft power is more than influence, since influence can also rest on the hard power of threats or payments. And soft power is more than just persuasion or the ability to move people by argument, though that is an important part of it. It is also the ability to attract, and attraction often leads to acquiescence.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In [[international relations]], soft power is generated only in part by what the government does through its policies and public diplomacy. The generation of soft power is also affected in positive (and negative) ways by a host of non-state actors within and outside the country. Those actors affect both the general public and governing elites in other countries, and create an enabling or disabling environment for government policies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In some cases, soft power enhances the probability of other elites adopting policies that allow one to achieve preferred outcomes. In other cases, where being seen as friendly to another country is seen as a local political kiss of death, the decline or absence of soft power will prevent a government from obtaining particular goals. But even in such instances, the interactions of civil societies and non-state actors may help to further general milieu goals such as democracy, liberty, and development. Soft power is not the possession of any one country or actor.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The success of soft power heavily depends on the actor's [[reputation]] within the [[international community]], as well as the flow of information between actors. Thus, soft power is often associated with the rise of [[globalization]] and [[Neoliberalism (international relations)|neoliberal international relations theory]]. [[Popular culture]] and [[mass media]] are regularly identified as a source of soft power,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france|title=Economic warfare on the silver screen|publisher=FRANCE 24|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=2012-01-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the spread of a national language or a particular set of [[norm (sociology)|normative]] structures; a nation with a large amount of soft power and the good will that engenders it inspire others to [[acculturation|acculturate]], avoiding the need for expensive [[hard power]] expenditures.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} More particularly, [[World news|international news]] was found crucial in shaping the image and reputation of foreign countries. The high prominence of the US in international news, for example, has been linked to its soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blondheim|first1=Menahem|last2=Segev|first2=Elad|title=Just Spell US Right: America’s News Prominence and Soft Power|journal=Journalism Studies|date=2015|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2015.1114899|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2015.1114899|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive news coverage was associated with positive international views, while negative news coverage with negative views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Segev|first=Elad|title=International News Online: Global Views with Local Perspectives|year=2016|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=9781433129841|pages=139–153|url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=85473&amp;concordeid=312985|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611205324/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=85473&amp;concordeid=312985|archivedate=2016-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because soft power has appeared as an alternative to raw power politics, it is often embraced by ethically-minded scholars and policymakers. But soft power is a descriptive rather than a normative concept. Like any form of power, it can be wielded for good or bad purposes. While soft power can be used with bad intentions and wreak horrible consequences, it differs in terms of means. It is on this dimension that one might construct a normative preference for greater use of soft power.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Research ==

Academics have engaged in several debates around soft power. These have included:
* Its usefulness (Giulio Gallarotti, Niall Ferguson, Josef Joffe, Robert Kagan, Ken Waltz, Mearsheimer vs Nye, Katzenstein, Janice Bially Mattern, Jacques Hymans, Alexander Vuving, Jan Mellisen)
* How soft power and hard power interact (Giulio Gallarotti, Joseph Nye)
* Whether soft power can be coercive or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], (Janice BIally Mattern, Katzenstein, Duvall &amp; Barnet vs Nye, Vuving)
* How the relationship between [[structure and agency]] work (Hymans vs Nye)
* Whether soft balancing is occurring (Wohlforth &amp; Brooks vs Walt ''et al''.)
* Soft power and normative power in Europe (Ian Manners, A Ciambra, Thomas Diez, A Hyde Pryce, Richard Whitman)
* How [[civil resistance]] (i.e., non-violent forms of resistance) can often involve certain uses of soft power, but remains a distinct concept (Adam Roberts, Timothy Garton Ash)
* The ways through which states' attempts at soft power can backfire, leading to instances of 'soft disempowerment' (Paul Michael Brannagan and Richard Giulianotti)

One study finds that a state's soft power has a measurable effect on its exports. Countries that are admired for their positive global influence export more, holding other things constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Soft power raises exports|url = http://www.voxeu.org/article/soft-power-raises-exports|website = VoxEU.org|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Throughout the world ===
The Soviet Union competed with the U.S. for influence throughout the [[Cold War]]. The Soviets were engaged in a broad campaign to convince the world of the attractiveness of its Communist system. In 1945, the Soviet Union was very effective in attracting many in Europe from its resistance to Hitler, and in colonized areas around the world because of its opposition to European imperialism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004). Ch 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets also employed a substantially large [[public diplomacy]] program that included: promoting their high culture, broadcasting, disseminating disinformation about the West, and sponsoring nuclear protests, peace movements, and youth organizations. Despite all of this, the Soviets' closed system and lack of popular culture impeded the ability of the Soviet Union to compete with the U.S. in terms of soft power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Soviet soft power in Poland : culture and the making of Stalin's new empire, 1943-1957 |last=Babiracki |first=Patryk |date=2015 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=9781469623085 |location=Chapel Hill |oclc=911173017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Autocracy|non-democratic governments]] have attempted to use [[Human migration|migration]] as an instrument of soft power: [[Egypt]] under the rule of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] trained and dispatched thousands of teachers across the [[Arab world]] in an effort to spread ideas of [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonialism]] and [[anti-Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tsourapas |first=Gerasimos |date= |title=Authoritarian emigration states: Soft power and cross-border mobility in the Middle East |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0192512118759902 |journal=International Political Science Review |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=400-416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cuba]], the [[Fidel Castro]] regime's [[Cuban medical internationalism|medical internationalism]] programme has dispatched thousands of medical professionals abroad for cultural diplomacy purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cuban medical internationalism : origins, evolution, and goals |last=Kirk |first=John M. |date=2009 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |last2=Erisman |first2=H.

After [[Pope John Paul II]] visited [[Poland]] in 1979, some political commentators said his visit influenced events against Poland's communist government, the [[Soviet Union]], and ultimately [[communism]], which promoted [[atheism]].&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008" /&gt;

{{quote|"The Pope won that struggle by transcending politics. His was what Joseph Nye calls "soft power" – the power of attraction and repulsion. He began with an enormous advantage, and exploited it to the utmost: He headed the one institution that stood for the polar opposite of the Communist way of life that the Polish people hated. He was a Pole, but beyond the regime’s reach. By identifying with him, Poles would have the chance to cleanse themselves of the compromises they had to make to live under the regime. And so they came to him by the millions. They listened. He told them to be good, not to compromise themselves, to stick by one another, to be fearless, and that God is the only source of goodness, the only standard of conduct. "Be not afraid," he said. Millions shouted in response, "We want God! We want God! We want God!" The regime cowered. Had the Pope chosen to turn his soft power into the hard variety, the regime might have been drowned in blood. Instead, the Pope simply led the Polish people to desert their rulers by affirming solidarity with one another. The Communists managed to hold on as despots a decade longer. But as political leaders, they were finished." &lt;ref&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Besides the Pope's visit, American-government broadcasting and propaganda into Soviet-occupied Europe, particularly Poland, contributed to the rise of the [[Solidarity]] movement and to the collapse of the Soviet-backed governments there and in the rest of the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance.&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71"/&gt;

Asia and more recently China have been working to use the potential soft power assets that are present in the admiration of their ancient cultures, arts, fashion and cuisine. China is presenting itself as a defender of national sovereignty,&lt;ref&gt;Friedberg, Aaron L. ''A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia'', New York: Norton Publishing, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which became an issue after the [[NATO]] air campaign to oust Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and NATO's support of the rebels in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;Felgenhauer, Pavel. "The Fall of Gaddafi Angers Many In Moscow". ''Eurasia Daily Monitor'' Volume: 8 Issue: 164. September 8, 2011. http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=38374&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese are also competing with the United States to gain influence throughout the South Pacific, however some commentators have said their recent assertiveness in this region has created an appeal for nations in this region to align with the United States thus increasing U.S. soft power in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Friedberg, Aaron L. ''A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia'', New York: Norton Publishing, 2011. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Soft power extends beyond the operations of government, to the activities of the private sector and to society and culture at large.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Carnes, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power,"in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008) p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Soft power has gained more influence because it addresses the underlying dispositions of the people who have increasingly become more active in their governments.&lt;ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008" /&gt; This is true even in authoritarian countries where people and institutions are increasingly able to shape the debate.&lt;ref&gt;Defense Science Board, Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Strategic Communication (Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, September 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[information age]] has also led to the rise of soft power resources for non-state actors, Primarily, through the use of global media, and to a greater extent the internet using tools such as the [[World Wide Web]], non-state actors have been able to increase their soft power and put pressure on governments that can ultimately affect policy outcomes. Instead of front organizations, non-state actors can create cyber advocacy organizations &lt;ref&gt;Steele, Robert D.

=== China ===
{{Main|Soft power of China}}
China's traditional culture has been a source of attraction, building on which it has created several hundred [[Confucius Institute]]s around the world to teach its language and culture. The enrollment of foreign students in China has increased from 36,000 a decade before to at least 240,000 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Nye Jr. Why China Is Weak on Soft Power; Jan, 17, 2012 https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/opinion/why-china-is-weak-on-soft-power.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; China's [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]] has attracted many western countries to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With New Bank, China Shows U.S. It's Got Soft Power|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/23/with-new-bank-china-shows-u-s-its-got-soft-power/print/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=31 July 2015|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, China had the second largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A spring 2014 Global Attitudes survey from Pew Research Center states China receives mostly positive reviews in the sub-Saharan African nations polled, although South Africans are closely divided (45% favorable, 40% unfavorable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Opposition to U.S. Surveillance and Drones, but Limited Harm to America’s Image|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/chapter-2-chinas-image/|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  China's increasing soft power can be explained by looking at China's economic growth and regarding economic engagement with many African countries. China's expansion of trade and investment on the African continent and the spread of Chinese-led infrastructure projects gives positive impressions of China to people in Africa. China's economic engagement in African countries is considered as much more pragmatic and in consistency with the priorities of many African countries. Moreover, China's increasing role as a global superpower seems appealing and this drives a desire to tie African economies more closely to China's economy.

China has made a systematic effort to expand and give greater profile to its soft-power policies in Africa ever since the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2000. The commitments of China's soft power ranges from health, humanitarian assistance to academic, professional and cultural exchange. China's assistance to Africa, however, is not near the U.S. assistance in Africa.

Cultural exchange between China and Africa can be a representative example of how China has been spreading its soft power.
In 2005, the first Confucius Institute was established in Africa. The institute is funded by the Chinese government and it provides Chinese language and cultural programming to the public. There are 19 institutes today in Africa and China has planned to spend 20 million renminbi for education projects in South Africa, including the teaching of Mandarin in 50 local high schools.

Furthermore, there is an increasing support for cultural visitors programs which gained momentum in 2004 when the African Cultural Visitors Program was established. There is a rising number of African entrepreneurs who choose to move to China and there are also diaspora communities in many Chinese cities that have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer G. Cooke. China's soft power in Africa; {{cite web |url=http://www.relooney.fatcow.com/SI_Oil-Politics/Africa-China_54.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324122951/http://www.relooney.fatcow.com/SI_Oil-Politics/Africa-China_54.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Africa, Chinese soft power extends to countries like [[Barbados]]. Barbadian Prime Minister [[David Thompson (Barbadian politician)|David Thompson]] expressed admiration for the Chinese economic model and sought to emulate the way Chinese state controlled banks guided development.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/cable/2009/03/09BRIDGETOWN144.html# Wikileaks 09Barbados144]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
[[France]] has long exerted a great amount of soft power. The country and [[French culture|its culture]] have for centuries been admired in many parts of the world; so much so that [[Thomas Jefferson]] is famously quoted as saying "Every man has two countries, his own and France."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://france.usembassy.gov/us-france-americans.html|title=Americans in France|publisher=[[U.S. Embassy Paris]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418070413/http://france.usembassy.gov/us-france-americans.html|archivedate=2015-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very term "culture" comes from France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/39149-french-culture.html French Culture: Customs &amp; Traditions], [[LiveScience]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, France had the third largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

France was a focal point of the [[Age of Enlightenment]];&lt;ref&gt;"Enlightenment thought culminates historically in the political upheaval of the French Revolution, in which the traditional hierarchical political and social orders (the French monarchy, the privileges of the French nobility, the political power and authority of the Catholic Church) were violently destroyed and replaced by a political and social order informed by the Enlightenment ideals of freedom and equality for all, founded, ostensibly, upon principles of human reason." [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/ Enlightenment], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; its attachment to the ideals of [[liberty]], [[Social equality|equality]], [[Toleration|tolerance]] and [[reason]] was notably embodied in the writing and publishing of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The [[French Revolution]] was one of the most significant events in European and world history. France has since then been instrumental in spreading [[Republicanism in France|Republican ideals]]. The [[Napoleonic Code]], which influenced much of the rest of Europe and beyond, is regarded as one of the most important law document of the [[modern era]].&lt;ref name="Robert B. Holtman 1981"&gt;Robert B. Holtman, ''The Napoleonic Revolution'' (Baton Rouge: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French language]] has for centuries been an important diplomatic language. For example, French has to be used  &amp;ndash; on par with English &amp;ndash; for all documents issued by the [[United Nations Treaty Series]], ensuring that all UN treaties are equally valid in their English and French versions.&lt;ref&gt;"Treaties registered with the United Nations Treaty Series are always translated into French and English. Documents are always provided in French and English. This city’s Geneva Conventions, written in equally authentic French and English versions, laid part of the groundwork for the international system." [https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/languages-diplomacy Languages of diplomacy - Towards a fairer distribution], [[The Economist]]&lt;/ref&gt;

France has also followed for decades a very active diplomatic and cultural policy. The ''[[Alliance Française]]'', whose aim is to promote the French language and French culture, was created as early as [[1883]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alliancefr.org/en/who-are-we |title=Who are we? |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120094935/http://www.alliancefr.org/en/who-are-we |archive-date=2015-11-20 |publisher=[[Alliance Française]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]'''s 2015 "Soft Power 30" report, France was ranked first in the "engagement" criteria, which is intended to measure "the reach of states’ diplomatic network and their commitment to major challenges like development and the environment." ''Monocle'' further noted that "In terms of influential reach, France is the best networked state in the world and is member of more multi-lateral organisations than any other country." Overall, France ranked fourth in that study.&lt;ref name="francemonocle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Report_Final-published.pdf |title=The Soft Power 30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120204008/http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Report_Final-published.pdf |archive-date=2015-11-20 |publisher=[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France's [[laïcité]], [[secularism]], policy has inspired some countries over time. For instance, France was [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]]'s main role model for [[Westernization]] as part of the major reform efforts that he spearheaded when he was President of [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Soner Cagaptay, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V8vQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=french+laicit%C3%A9+turkey&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Gz_UaAWfWN&amp;sig=NAEle23Sl5HmUbOS2mjT-NnAl0U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA45fHrbXJAhXH8RQKHfvKAIwQ6AEIWzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=french%20laicit%C3%A9%20turkey&amp;f=false The Rise of Turkey: The Twenty-First Century's First Muslim Power], pp. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt;

France, and in particular [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sonia-gil/myths-and-truths-romantic-cities_b_4777532.html Myths and Truths: The Most Romantic Cities Around the World], [[The Huffington Post]], 2014&lt;/ref&gt; has long been considered one of the most romantic places to be. France was in 2014 [[Tourism in France|the most visited country in the world]].&lt;ref name="WTO Tourism Highlights 2015 Edition"&gt;{{cite press release |title= UNWTO Tourism Highlights 2015 Edition |publisher=UNWTO |date=25 June 2015 |url=http://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284416899 |accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
The annual soft power rankings by ''Monocle'' magazine and the Institute for Government ranks 30 countries which “best attract favor from other nations through culture, sport, cuisine, design, diplomacy and beyond.”
''Monocle'' magazine said: “[[Angela Merkel|Merkel]] may be painted as a stern taskmaster but it seems she has a softer side, or the country she leads does.”
It said Germany’s rise as a soft power should not come as a surprise.
“The country is traditionally excellent at pursuing its ideas, values and aims using diplomatic, cultural and economic tools," it said. “By quietly doing the simple things well it is a country that has become a global power and the rest of us can feel comfortable with that.”
Germans had been understandably wary about depicting a dominant image abroad, the magazine added, but it said that the country’s rise should not make everyone else feel uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Germany tops world 'soft power' rankings; http://www.thelocal.de/20131121/germany-number-one-for-soft-power&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerhard Schröder: 'Germany Can Only Lead Europe the Way Porcupines Mate'|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/interview-former-german-chancellor-gerhard-schroeder-on-foreign-policy-a-891839.html|publisher=Spiegel Online International|accessdate=30 July 2015|date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama sets off on farewell trip to Europe in shadow of president-elect|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/barack-obama-faces-awkward-task-on-sad-farewell-visit-to-europe|accessdate=14 November 2016|work=Reuters|date=14 November 2016|quote=As the Americans see it, Merkel – and certainly not the vainglorious European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker – runs the EU.

=== Italy ===
The famous elements of Italian soft culture are its art, music, fashion, and iconic food. Italy was the birthplace of [[opera]],&lt;ref&gt;Kimbell, David R. B. [https://books.google.com/books?id=C37Gq2GagZIC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Italian Opera.''] Cambridge University Press, 1994. p. 1. Web. 22 Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and for generations the language of opera was [[Italian language|Italian]], irrespective of the nationality of the composer. Popular tastes in drama in Italy have long favored comedy; the improvisational style known as the ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'' began in Italy in the mid-16th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=it |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/commedia-dell-arte/ |title=Commedia dell'arte |work=Treccani, il portale del sapere |access-date=24 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still performed today. Before being exported to France, the famous [[Ballet]] dance genre also originated in Italy.
The country boasts several world-famous cities. [[Rome]] was the ancient capital of the Roman Empire and seat of the [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. [[Florence]] was the heart of the [[Renaissance]], a period of great achievements in [[the arts]] that ended the Dark Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Zirpolo, Lilian H. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QPqWxHwdMNAC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The A to Z of Renaissance Art.''] Scarecrow Press, 2009. pp. 154-156. Web. 16 Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important cities include [[Turin]], which used to be the capital of Italy, and is now one of the world's great centers of automobile engineering. [[Milan]] is a  [[fashion capital]] of the World. [[Venice]], with its intricate canal system, attracts tourists from all over the world especially during the [[Venetian Carnival]] and the [[Biennale]].
Italy is home to the greatest number of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s (51) to date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list |title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |access-date=25 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=it |url=http://www.sitiunesco.it/beni-italiani.html |title=Beni Italiani Unesco |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716051913/http://www.sitiunesco.it/beni-italiani.html |archive-date=2012-07-16 |work=Associazione Città e Siti Unesco |access-date=17 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to one estimate the country is home to half the world's great art treasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbot |first=Charles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGuWGa48iQMC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Italy |publisher=Morellini Editore |year=2006 |page=101 |access-date=24 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nation has, overall, an estimated 100,000 monuments of any sort (churches, cathedrals, archaeological sites, houses and statues).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvYobEC-wtEC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Italy |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Ltd |year=2012 |pages=23-24 |access-date=1 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
{{Main article|Cool Japan}}
"'''Cool Japan'''" is a concept coined in 2002 as an expression of [[Culture of Japan|Japan’s popular culture]]. The concept has been adopted by the Japanese government as well as trade bodies seeking to exploit the commercial capital of the country’s culture industry.&lt;ref&gt;Japan's Soft Power-Squaring the Cool, June 14, 2014; https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2014/06/japans-soft-power&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cool Japan Illustrated, http://www.cool-jp.com/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as a form of soft power, "the ability to indirectly influence behavior or interests through cultural or ideological means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christine R.

In a 2002 article in the journal ''Foreign Policy'' titled “Japan’s Gross National Cool”, Douglas McGray wrote of Japan “reinventing superpower” as its cultural influence expanded internationally despite the economic and political problems of the “lost decade.” Surveying youth culture and the role of J-pop, manga, anime, fashion, film, consumer electronics, architecture, and cuisine, McGray highlighted Japan’s considerable soft power, posing the question of what message the country might project. He also argued that Japan’s recession may even have boosted its national cool, due to the partial discrediting of erstwhile rigid social hierarchies and big-business career paths.&lt;ref name="McGray"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douglasmcgray.com/cool-japan.html |title=Japan's Gross National Cool |author=McGray, Douglas |publisher=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2002/05/01/japans_gross_national_cool |title=Japan's Gross National Cool |url-access=subscription |author=McGray, Douglas |publisher=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Japan had the fifth largest diplomatic network in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"'''Hallyu'''", also known as the "'''Korean Wave'''", is a [[neologism]] referring to the spread of South Korean culture since the late 1990s. According to a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reporter, the spread of South Korean entertainment has led to higher sales of other goods and services such as food, clothing, and [[Korean language]] classes.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/30/AR2006083002985.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Japanese Women Catch the 'Korean Wave'|first=Anthony|last=Faiola|date=August 31, 2006|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides increasing the amount of exports, the ''Korean Wave'' is used by the government as a soft power tool to engage with the masses of young people all over the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=K-pop: Soft Power for the Global Cool|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/linda-constant/kpop-soft-power-for-the-g_b_1088238.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|first=Linda|last=Constant|date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to try reduce [[anti-Korean sentiment]].&lt;ref name="antikoreansentiment"&gt;{{cite news|title=Korea to turn hallyu into industry|url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120417001073|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|quote=To prevent anti-Korean sentiment, the government will offer incentives for production companies or broadcasters planning to jointly produce movies or dramas with Chinese companies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[BBC]]'s country rating poll revealed that public opinion of [[South Korea]] has been improving every year since the first rating poll for the country was conducted in 2009. In several countries such as [[Russia]], [[India]], [[China]] and [[France]], public opinion of South Korea turned from slightly negative to generally positive. The report cited culture and tradition as among the most important factors contributing to positive perceptions of South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 BBC Country Ratings|url=http://www.globescan.com/images/images/pressreleases/bbc2012_country_ratings/2012_bbc_country%20rating%20final%20080512.pdf|publisher=Globescan/BBC World Service|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes alongside a rapid growth in the total value of cultural exports which rose to US$4.2 billion in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Christian|title=South Korea's K-pop takes off in the west|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ddf11662-53c7-11e1-9eac-00144feabdc0.html|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First driven by the spread of [[Korean drama]]s televised across [[East Asia|East]], [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] during its initial stages, the ''Korean Wave'' evolved from a regional development into a global phenomenon due to the proliferation of Korean pop ([[K-pop]]) music videos on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Yoon, Lina.

=== United States ===
The [[United States]] has long had a great deal of soft power. Examples include [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[four freedoms]] in Europe at the end of [[World War II]], young people behind the [[Iron Curtain]] listening to the government's foreign propaganda arm [[Radio Free Europe]], Chinese students symbolizing their protests in [[Tiananmen Square]] by creating a replica of the [[Statue of Liberty]] that they called "Goddess of Democracy", newly liberated Afghans in 2001 asking for a copy of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and young Iranians today surreptitiously watching banned American videos and satellite television broadcasts in the privacy of their homes.&lt;ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X" /&gt; America's early commitment to religious toleration, for example, was a powerful element of its overall appeal to potential immigrants; and American aid in the reconstruction of Europe after World War II was a propaganda victory to show off the prosperity and the generosity of the people of the United States.

Studies of American broadcasting into the [[Soviet bloc]], and testimonials from Czech President [[Václav Havel]], Polish President [[Lech Wałęsa]], and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] support that soft power efforts of the United States and its allies during the Cold War were ultimately successful in creating the favorable conditions that led to the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Carnes Lord, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"Satellite TV is actively promoting American soft power in the Arab world in ways that the United States has been incapable of doing. The launch of the Arabic-language [[Alhurra]] satellite channel in early 2004 to provide news and entertainment in ways more beneficial to the U.S., marked an important turning point in U.S. public diplomacy development. Though it calls itself the largest Arabic-language news organization in the world, the Virginia-based Alhurra lacks the cachet and brand recognition of Al Jazeera, but its balanced presentation of news has earned it a small but significant viewership. Controversial innovations in radio broadcasting that target young mass audiences through a mix of light news and mild American popular music – [[Radio Sawa]] in [[Arabic]] and [[Radio Farda]] in [[Persian language|Persian]] – have captured a substantial market share in their target regions."&lt;ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71" /&gt;

{{Sufism|Ideas}}{{Islam}}

Major ideas in '''Sufi metaphysics''' have surrounded the concept of ''weḥdah'' ({{lang|ar|وحدة}}) meaning "unity", or in Arabic {{lang|ar|توحيد}} ''[[tawhid]]''. Two main [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Islamic philosophy|philosophies]] prevail on this  topic. ''waḥdat al-wujūd'' literally means the "Unity of Existence" or "Unity of Being" but better translation would be Monotheism of Existence. Wujud (i.e. existence) here refers to Allah's Wujud - implication is Wahdat/Tawheed Of Wujud Of Allah. On the other hand, ''waḥdat ash-shuhūd'', meaning "Apparentism" or  "Monotheism of Witness", holds that [[God in Islam|God]] and his creation are entirely separate.

Some [[Islamic]] reformers have claimed that the difference between the two philosophies differ only in [[semantics]] and that the entire debate is merely a collection of "verbal controversies" which have come about because of ambiguous [[language]]. However, the concept of the relationship between [[God]] and the [[universe]] is still actively debated both among Sufis and between Sufis and non-Sufi [[Muslim]]s.

== Waḥdat al-Wujūd (Unity of Existence)==
The [[philosophy]] of Wahdat al-Wujud was first ever prevailed by [[Husayn ibn Ali]] in his book Mirat-ul-Arifeen which he wrote in response to the question of his son [[Zayn al-Abidin]] about the explanation of [[Surah]] [[Al-Fatiha]]. In this [[book]], he interpreted the [[ideology]] of  Wahdat al-wujud for the first time in the most comprehensive way.{{citation needed|reason=The existence of this work is disputed first. if this work exists a reliable interpretation must also be mentioned. The text should be written ink the conductive genus and not indicative, because it is not clear.|date=August 2016}} After that, the mystical thinker and theologian [[Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi]] discussed this concept in his book called Tohfa Mursala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.yanabi.com/index.php?/topic/376532-tohfa-mursala-sharif-lectures-by-khawaja-ghulam-qutab-din-faridi-dba/ | title = Tohfa Mursala by Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi | publisher = yanabi.com | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160518214710/http://www.yanabi.com/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F376532-tohfa-mursala-sharif-lectures-by-khawaja-ghulam-qutab-din-faridi-dba%2F | archivedate = 18 May 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Andalusia]]n Sufi saint [[Ibn Sabin]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr|S.H. Nasr]] (2006), ''Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present: Philosophy in the Land of Prophecy'', State University of New York Press, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; is also known to employ this term in his writings. But the [[Sufi]] [[saint]] who is most characterized in discussing the ideology of Sufi metaphysics in deepest details is [[Ibn Arabi]].&lt;ref name="muslimphilosophy1"&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H022 Ibn al-'Arabi, Muhyi al-Din (1164–1240)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He employs the term wujud to refer to God as the Necessary [[Being]]. He also attributes the term to everything other than God, but he insists that wujud does not belong to the things found in the [[cosmos]] in any real sense. Rather, the things borrow wujud from [[God]], much as the [[earth]] borrow light from the [[sun]]. The issue is how wujūd can rightfully be attributed to the things, also called "[[entity|entities]]" (aʿyān). From the perspective of [[tanzih]], [[Ibn Arabi]] declares that wujūd belongs to [[God]] alone, and, in his famous phrase, the things "have never smelt a whiff of wujud." From the point of view of [[tasbih]], he affirms that all things are wujūd's self-disclosure ([[tajalli]]) or self-manifestation (ẓohur). In sum, all things are "He/not He" (howa/lāhowa), which is to say that they are both God and other than God, both wujud and other than wujud.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Imaginal worlds, William Chiittick (1994), pg.53&lt;/ref&gt; In his book Fasus –al-Hikam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ibn Arabi|url=http://www.sufi.ir/books/download/english/ibn-arabi-en/fusus-al-hikam-en.pdf|title=Fasus-al-Hikam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Ibn-e-Arabi|url=https://bewley.virtualave.net/fusus.html|title=Fasus-al-Hikam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn-e-Arabi states that " wujūd is the unknowable and inaccessible ground of everything that exists.  God alone is true wujūd, while all things dwell in nonexistence, so also wujūd alone is nondelimited (muṭlaq), while everything else is constrained, confined, and constricted. Wujūd is the absolute, infinite, nondelimited reality of God, while all others remain relative, finite, and delimited".

[[Ibn Arabi]]’s doctrine of wahdat ul wujud focuses on the esoteric ([[Batin (Islam)|batin]]) reality of creatures instead of exoteric ([[Zahir (Islam)|zahir]]) dimension of reality. Therefore he interprets that wujud is one and unique reality from which all reality derives. The external world of sensible objects is but a fleeting shadow of the Real (al- Haq), God . God alone is the all embracing and [[eternity|eternal]] reality. Whatever exists is the shadow([[tajalli]]) of the Real and is not independent of God. This is summed up in [[Ibn Arabi]]’s own words.
" [[Glory (religion)|Glory]] to Him who created all things, being Himself their very [[essence]](ainuha)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/hmp/chp20.doc|title=A History of Muslim Philosophy, pg. 409.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To call wujud or Real Being "one" is to speak of the unity of the Essence. In other terms, it is to say that Being—Light in itself—is nondelimited (mutlaq), that is, [[infinity|infinite]] and [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], undefined and indefinable, indistinct and indistinguishable. In contrast, everything other than Being—every existent thing (mawjûd)—is [[distinction (philosophy)|distinct]], [[defined]], and limited(muqayyad). The Real is incomparable and transcendent, but it discloses itself (tajallî) in all things, so it is also similar and immanent. It possesses such utter nondelimitation that it is not delimited by nondelimitation. "God possesses Nondelimited Being, but no delimitation prevents Him from delimitation. On the contrary, He possesses all delimitations, so He is nondelimited delimitation" &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-arabi/|title= (Ibn ‘Arabî, al-Futûhât}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the highest level, wujūd is the absolute and nondelimited reality of God, the "Necessary Being" (wājib al-wujūd) that cannot not exist. In this sense, wujūd designates the Essence of God or of the Real (dhāt al-ḥaqq), the only reality that is real in every respect. On lower levels, wujūd is the underlying substance of "everything other than God" (māsiwāAllāh)—which is how [[Ibn Arabi]] and others define the "cosmos" or "universe" (al-ʿālam). Hence, in a secondary meaning, the term wujūd is used as shorthand to refer to the whole [[cosmos]], to everything that exists. It can also be employed to refer to the existence of each and every thing that is found in the [[universe]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Imaginal worlds, William Chiittick(1994), pg.15&lt;/ref&gt;

God's 'names' or '[[Property (philosophy)|attributes]]', on the other hand, are the relationships which can be discerned between the [[Essence]] and the [[cosmos]]. They are known to God because he knows every object of knowledge, but they are not existent entities or ontological qualities, for this would imply plurality in the godhead.&lt;ref name="muslimphilosophy1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-arabi/#WahAlWu|title=Names and Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ibn 'Arabî used the term "effusion" (fayd) to denote the act of creation. His writings contain expressions which show different stages of creation, a distinction merely logical and not actual. The following gives details about his vision of creation in three stages: the Most Holy Effusion (al-fayd al-aqdas), the Holy Effusion (al-fayd al-muqaddas) and the Perpetual Effusion (al-fayd al-mustamirr).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articles/unityofbeing.html Souad Hakim – Unity of Being in Ibn 'Arabî&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Waḥdat al-wujūd spread through the teachings of the [[Sufi]]s like Qunyawi, Jandi, Tilimsani, Qayshari, Jami etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present(2006), pg76&lt;/ref&gt;

The noted scholar [[Muhibullah Allahabadi]] strongly supported the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hadi|first=Nabi|title=Dictionary of Indo-Persian Literature|page=427 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjJmzdJFOHwC&amp;pg=PA427|accessdate=2014-11-10|year=1995|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-311-3|chapter=MuhhibbullahIlahabadi, Shaikh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sachal Sarmast]] and [[Bulleh Shah]] two Sufi poets from [[India]], were also ardent followers of Waḥdat al-wujūd.
It is also associated with the ''Hamah Ust'' ([[Persian Language|Persian]] meaning "He is the only one") philosophy in South Asia.

==Tashkīk==
Tashkīk or gradation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WwAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=tashkik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAGoVChMIh4-Oo7e3yAIVT81jCh2-sQdU#v=onepage&amp;q=tashkik&amp;f=false|title=tashkik}}&lt;/ref&gt; is closely associated with Sadrian interpretation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H027.html|title=Tashkik al Wujud}}&lt;/ref&gt; of waḥdat al-wujūd. According to this school, the reality and [[existence]] are identical which means existence is one but graded in intensity. This methodology was given a name of tashkik al-wujud and it thus explains that there is gradation of existence that stand in a vast hierarchical chain of being (marāṭib al-wujūd) from floor (farsh) to divine throne (ʿarsh), but the wujūd of each existent ''māhīyya'' is nothing but a grade of the single reality of wujūd whose source is God, the absolute being (al-wujūd al-mutlaq). What differentiates the wujūd of different existents is nothing but wujūd in different degrees of strength and weakness. The universe is nothing but different degrees of strengths and weaknesses of wujūd, ranging from intense degree of wujūd of arch-angelic realities, to the dim wujūd of lowly dust from which Adam was made.&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present, pg 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the concept==
Sufi metaphysics has been a subject to criticism by most non-Sufis; in [[Al-Andalus]], where most of the Muslim scholars were either [[Zahiri]]tes or [[Maliki]]tes preferring the [[Ash'ari]]te [[Islamic theology|creed]], Sufi metaphysics was considered blasphemy and its practitioners blacklisted.&lt;ref name=arabi169&gt;Alexander D. Knysh, ''Ibn Arabi in the Later Islamic Tradition''. Pg. 169. [[State University of New York Press]]: [[Albany, New York|Albany]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Followers of the Ash'arite creed in the east were often suspicious of Sufism as well, most often citing Sufi metaphysics as well.&lt;ref name=arabi169/&gt;

===Criticism from within Sufism===
Some [[Sufi]]s, such as [[Ahmad Sirhindi]], have criticised wahdat-al-wujud. Ahmad Sirhindi wrote about the sayings that universe has no existence of its own and is a shadow of the existence of the necessary being. He also wrote that one should discern the existence of universe from the absolute and that the absolute does not exist because of existence but because of his essence.&lt;ref&gt;MaktoobatRabbaniyah&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to criticism===
[[Pir Meher Ali Shah]] and [[Syed Waheed Ashraf]] have countered that the two concepts differ in that wahdat-al-wujud states that God and the universe aren't identical.&lt;ref&gt;TehqiqulHaq fi KalamatulHaq a book by [[Meher Ali Shah|PirMeher Ali Shah]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Tasawwuf' a book in Urdu by [[Syed Waheed Ashraf]]&lt;/ref&gt; They hold real existence to be for God only and the universe to have no existence on its own.

==Waḥdat asḥ-Shuhūd==
Waḥdat asḥ-Shuhūd (or ''wah-dat-ul-shuhud'', ''wahdat-ul-shuhud,'' or ''wahdatulshuhud'') has often been translated into English as '''Apparentism'''. In Arabic it literally means "unity of witness", "unity of perception", "unity of appearance" or "oneness of manifestation".

Out of those who opposed the doctrine of waḥdat al-wujūd, there were those who substituted the pole of subject for the object, formulating the doctrine of Waḥdat asḥ-Shuhūd. This school was formulated by ʿAlāʾ ad-DawlahSimnānī, was to attract many followers in India, including [[Ahmed Sirhindi]] who provided some of the most widely accepted formulations of this doctrine in the Indian sub-continent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Tasawwuf' book in Urdu by Syed Waheed Ashraf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ahmed Sirhindi's doctrine, any experience of unity between God and the created world is purely subjective and occurs only in the mind of the believer; it has no objective counterpart in the real world. The former position, Shaykh Ahmad felt, led to pantheism, which was contrary to the tenets of Sunni Islam.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} He held that God and creation are not identical; rather, the latter is a shadow or reflection of the Divines Name and Attributes when they are reflected in the mirrors of their opposite non-beings (aʿdām al-mutaqābilah).{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}[[Abu Hafs Umar al-Suhrawardi]] and [[Abd-al-karim Jili]] were also proponents of apparent-ism.

==Al-Wujūd Al-Munbasiṭ (Self-unfolding Being)==
[[Shah Waliullah Dehlawi]] tried to reconcile the two (apparently) contradictory doctrines of waḥdat al-wujūd (unity of being) of [[Ibn Arabi]] and waḥdat ash-shuhūd (unity in conscience) of Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi. Shah Waliullah neatly resolved the conflict, calling these differences 'verbal controversies' which have come about because of ambiguous language. If we leave, he says, all the metaphors and similes used for the expression of ideas aside, the apparently opposite views of the two metaphysicians will agree. The positive result of Shah Wali Allah's reconciliatory efforts was twofold: it brought about harmony between the two opposing groups of meta-physicians, and it also legitimized the doctrine of waḥdat al-wujūd among the mutakallimun (theologians), who previously had not been ready to accept it.

In his books Lamahat and Sata'at, he discusses stages of being, the perceptive faculty, the relation of the abstract with the universe, the universal soul and the souls of man, after death, essence, miracles, the scope of man, the soul of the perfect, universal order, source of manifestation, and the transformation of mystics from quality to quality. He also demonstrated that the long-standing assumption that Sufi doctrine was divided between Apparentism and Unity of Being was a difference of expression alone, the latter doctrine being seen as merely a less-advanced stage of projection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H045 Shah Wali Allah (Qutb al-Din Ahmad al-Rahim) (1703–62)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his opinion this whole universe has also self (nafs) as an individual person has a self, which is called the Universal Soul (an-nafs al-kullīyyah). The multiplicity of the whole universe has originated from it. When [[Ibn Arabi]] says that everything is God, he thereby means the Universal Soul. This Universal Soul, or the Self-unfolding Being (al-wujūd-al-munbasiṭ), subsists by itself. This existence pervades the whole universe, both the substance and the accident, and accepts the form of everything. It is both immanent and transcendental. Beyond this existence (al-wujūd al-munbasiṭ : Universal Soul) towards the original existence (God) none has access to. In other words, man's progress ends with the Universal Soul or the Self-unfolding Being. He cannot move a step further. The Universal Soul and God are so intermingled that the former is often taken for the latter."

As for the question of the relation that this existence (al-wujūd al-munbasiṭ) has with the essence of God itself. This relation is, however, known only in its reality (anniyyah : I-ness); its quality is unknown and can never be known. Thus when [[Ibn Arabi]] says that the realities of the existing things are the names and the attributes of the Universal Soul (Self-unfolding Being) in the stage of knowledge (fīmarṭabat al-ʿilm, in the Divine Consciousness) or when Imam Rabbani asserts that the realities of existing objects are sheer nothingness on which the lights of the names and attributes of the Universal Soul (al-wujūd al-munbasiṭ) are reflected is exactly the same thing. The difference in their language is so little that it needs no consideration.&lt;ref&gt;G. N. Jalbani, ''The Teachings of Shah Waliyullah of Delhi'', pg98&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waḥdat al-Maqṣūd ==
[[Sultan Bahoo]] first introduced the concept of 'waḥdat al-maqṣūd,' the 'intention of Unity' or the 'necessity of unity.' Sultan Bahoo did not sufficiently elaborate on this idea, focusing his interest and attention towards the concept of 'fanāʾ fi-llāh, baqāʾbillāh' ([[Annihilation]] in God, Lasting with God). He was the only [[Sufi]] scholar to establish the concept of lasting forever with [[Allah]] by ceasing, or annihilating one's self in [[Allah]].

[[File:Mary Cassatt - Afternoon Tea Party.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Afternoon Tea Party - Mary Cassatt|''Afternoon Tea Party'' c. 1891, by [[Mary Cassatt]]]]
A '''tea party''' is a formal, ritualized gathering for the small meal called [[Tea (meal)#Afternoon tea|afternoon tea]].&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Book Of Wedding Crafts - Page 64 Rockport Publishers - 2005 "A tea party is a perfect example of the latter. Tea, sandwiches, cookies, and — best of all — a chance to hang out with your pals."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Bridesmaid Guide: Modern Advice on Etiquette, Parties, and ... - Page 68 Kate Chynoweth - 2011 "Easy Concept: When the guest list includes ladies ages eight to eighty, a traditional tea party is an excellent way to entertain. Swap complicated shower themes and rowdy party games for a simple afternoon of charming conversation, delicious ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal tea parties are often characterized by the use of prestige utensils, such as [[porcelain]], [[bone china]] or [[silver (household)|silver]]. The table is made to look its prettiest, with cloth napkins and matching cups and plates. In addition to tea, larger parties may provide [[Punch (drink)|punch]], or in cold weather, [[hot chocolate]]. The tea is accompanied by a variety of foods that are easy to manage while in a sitting room: thin [[sandwich]]es, such as [[Cucumber sandwich|cucumber]] or tomato, cake slices, [[buns]] or [[Bread roll|rolls]], [[cookies]], [[biscuits]] and [[scones]] are all common.

==History==
[[Image:Grün - A Group of Artists.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A Group of Artists - Jules Grün|''A Group of Artists'', [[Paris]] c. 1929, by [[Jules-Alexandre Grün]]]]

===Formal teas===
The afternoon tea party was a feature of [[great house]]s in the [[Victorian Era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] ages in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Gilded Age]] in the [[United States]], as well as in all continental Europe (France, Germany, and above all in the [[Russian Empire]]). The formal tea party still survives as a special event, as in the [[debutante]] teas of some affluent American communities.

In the older version, servants stayed outside the room until needed. Writing in 1922, [[Emily Post]] asserted that servants were never to enter the room unless rung for, to bring in fresh water and dishes or to remove used dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 12. The Well-Appointed House. Post, Emily. 1922. Etiquette|url = http://www.bartleby.com/95/12.html|website = www.bartleby.com|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was partly due to the rigidity of social convention at the time, but it also reflected the intimate nature of the afternoon tea. Proving the truth of 18th-century author [[Henry Fielding]]'s quip that "love and scandal are the best sweeteners of tea", the custom of banning servants from the drawing room during tea shows the hostess's desire to encourage free conversation among her guests. Most of the formalities of that age have disappeared, particularly since World War II, when [[Progressive tax|economic changes]] made household servants a rarity, but afternoon tea can still provide a good opportunity for intimate conversation and a refreshing light meal.

==={{anchor|kettle drum|Kettle drum|kettledrum|kettle-drum|Kettle-drum|Kettledrum}}"Kettle drums"===
A less formal large afternoon party for tea was known during the 18th and 19th centuries as a "kettle drum". A widespread but possibly [[false etymology|false folk etymology]] suggests that the name "kettle drum" may have originated in the informal tea gatherings hosted by British camp officers' wives during [[Company rule in India|East India Company rule]] or the [[British occupation of India]], during which [[kettle drum]]s are claimed to have served as tea tables in the camps.&lt;ref name=judithmartin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Judith|authorlink=Judith Martin|title=Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium|date=1990|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=9780671722289|pages=452–453|accessdate=5 November 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju1XvqoMookC&amp;lpg=PA453&amp;ots=5IwdAEC7FO&amp;dq=%22kettle%20drum%22%20party&amp;pg=PA452#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kettle%20drum%22%20party&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=farrow&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farrow|first1=Edward Samuel|title=Farrow's military encyclopedia: a dictionary of military knowledge|date=1895|publisher=Military-Naval Publishing Company|page=152|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UusfAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;ots=nUG0CIC0kE&amp;dq=%22kettle%20drum%22%20party&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kettle%20drum%22%20party&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, "kettle drum" may have been an amalgam of "drum" — 18th-century slang for a vivacious party — and "kettle" for the tea served.&lt;ref name=chambers&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Chambers|editor1-first=William|editor2-last=Chambers|editor2-first=Robert|title=The Kettle-Drum|journal=[[Chambers's Journal of Popular Literature, Science and Arts]]|date=20 November 1875|issue=621|page=737|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bCMZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA737|accessdate=17 November 2014|series=4th series}}&lt;/ref&gt; At kettle drums, guests traditionally came for short periods and left at will, mingled and conversed with little formality, and partook of tea, [[drinking chocolate|chocolate]], lemonade, cakes, and sandwiches. Guests were expected to dress for ordinary daytime visiting, but not more formally.

===Children's parties===
Tea parties are also created by young children where the guests consist of [[Stuffed toy|stuffed animals]], [[doll]]s, [[Friendship|friends]] (both real and [[Imaginary friend|imaginary]]) and [[Family|family members]].&lt;ref&gt;Strategies for including children with special needs in early ... - Page 144 M. Diane Klein, Ruth E. Cook, Anne Marie Richardson-Gibbs - 2001 "Helpful. Hint. The traditional tea party and feeding a doll are two of the most engaging ways of introducing children with special needs to pretend play."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tea party of Alice==
[[File:Teaparty.svg|thumb|right|The mad tea-party from ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Wonderland]]'' c. 1865, illustrated by [[John Tenniel]]]]
In the chapter "A Mad Tea-Party" in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', Alice becomes a guest at a tea party along with the [[March Hare]], the [[The Hatter|Hatter]], and a sleeping [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]] who remains asleep for most of the chapter. The other characters give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous '[[The Hatter#The Hatter's riddle|Why is a raven like a writing desk?]]'. The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because time has punished him by eternally standing still at 6 pm (tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves, claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]]. "[[The Annotated Alice]]". [[Crown Publishing Group|Clarkson N Potter Inc]], 1960, [[Mad Tea Party|Chapter VII]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world==
[[Yum cha]] is the Chinese equivalent of a tea party, though it is usually held in a restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;Jolliffe, Lee (2007). ''Tea and Tourism: Tourists, Traditions and Transformations''. page 56. "Yum cha, for example, is a traditional tea party and a family gathering that takes place in a commercial catering outlet."&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''watch system,''' '''watch schedule,''' or '''watch bill''' is a method of assigning regular periods of work duty aboard ships and some other areas of employment. A watch system allows the ship's crew to operate the ship 24&amp;nbsp;hours a day for the duration of long voyages or operations.

Many watch systems incorporate the concept of '''dogging''', whereby one watch is split into two shorter watches so that there is an odd number each day.&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt; Doing so allows crew members to have a different watch schedule each day.&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt; Often, the [[dog watch]]es are set at dinner time to allow the entire crew to be fed in short order.&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;

In the traditional [[Royal Navy]] watch system (a system used by most other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] navies), 'watch' refers to a period of time and to a grouping of personnel. Those members of the crew whose work must be done at all times of the day – known as 'watch-keepers' – are assigned to one of two watches: the [[Starboard]] or the [[Port (nautical)|Port]] watch.  These can be further divided into two parts, e.g. First Port, Second Starboard. These two watches – or more usually the four parts of watches – alternate in working the following watches:

* First watch: 2000 to 0000&lt;ref name="usni357"&gt;USNI, 1996:357.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Middle watch: 0000 to 0400&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;
* Morning watch: 0400 to 0800&lt;ref name="usni357"/&gt;

The same arrangement of watch times can also be used with a crew divided into three sections.  This gives each sailor more time off-duty, sometimes allowing sleeping periods of over seven hours. Names for the three watches—instead of Port and Starboard—vary from ship to ship. Naming schemes such as "[[Foremast]]", "[[Mainmast]]" and "[[Mizzen]]" and "Red", "White" and "Blue" are common.

The so-called "five-and-dime" arrangement splits the day into five-hour watches, with the exception of a four-hour watch from 22:00 to 02:00.

The "Six-Hour-Shift" splits the day in four 6-hour watches, permitting a three section crew to maximize rest time in a 3-day working cycle. Also, this watch systems takes into better account the meal times (of a 4 meal-a-day system), so that the ingoing team will be fed first, then stand watch, while the outgoing team will be relieved of watch, and then proceed to the messdeck.

Aboard [[United States]] [[submarine]]s, the crew is typically divided into three sections, with each section standing 8 hours of watch followed by 16 hours off-watch. This schedule has been a fairly recent change to submariner work and rest routines. For nearly 45 years prior to 2015, submariners were on 18-hour days with 6 hours of watch followed by 12 hours off watch. The 12 hours off-watch were further divided into the first 6 hours being used for maintenance, cleaning, and entertainment; while the second 6 hours were usually for sleeping.

Note that this arrangement resulted in one of the sections having two watches in one (24-hour) day, and there were no dog watches. Also, watch reliefs occurred no later than the bottom of the hour (2330, 0530, 1130, 1730). Typically, the first 30 minutes of the hour were used for the oncoming section to eat while the second 30 minutes of the hour were used for the off-going section to eat.

Some warships now use the one-in-two system, also known as 7s and 5s, for the duration of the watches.  This gives the sailors a longer sleeping period than the traditional two-watch system, while still maintaining the ability for the ship to function.  Meals are generally scheduled around the watch turnovers at 0700, 1200, and 1700; sometimes a light midnight meal is provided for the 0000 turnover.

Various alternative watch schedules have been devised, which are typically referred to as '''Swedish watches'''.  Although there is no standard for what constitutes a Swedish watch, the variations all feature some element of extended watches to accommodate longer time off. Like the traditional watch system, they begin at 2000&amp;nbsp;hours. Some popular variations have durations of 6, 6, 4, 4, 4 and 5, 5, 5, 5, 4.

On [[merchant ship]]s, watchstanders typically stand watch for three periods of four consecutive hours. This system has a couple of advantages: it is easy to remember and it is consistent. For example, a member of watch team 1 will only have to remember that he is on the "4–8" watch, and knows that he goes on watch at 4&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 4&amp;nbsp;p.m. This scheme also allows inexperienced watchstanders to stand watch from 8–12&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 8–12&amp;nbsp;p.m., when senior watchstanders are likely to be awake and ready to assist in case of trouble. 

By custom, in a ship with five deck officers the junior third mate takes the 8 to 12 watch, the senior third mate the 12 to 4 watch, and the second mate the 4 to 8 watch. This enables the second officer, who is the ship's navigator, to take morning and evening star sights. In ships with only four deck officers, the third officer will stand the 8 to 12, the second officer the 12 to 4, and the Chief Mate (equivalent to the Executive Officer in a navy ship) the 4 to 8 watch. The reason for this is to enable the Chief Mate to assign work to the deck gang before the ship's day begins, and to inspect it before going on watch at 1600 hours.

'''Wave power''' is the capture of energy of [[wind wave]]s to do useful [[mechanical work|work]] – for example, [[electricity generation]], [[water desalination]], or [[pump]]ing water. A machine that exploits wave [[power (physics)|power]] is a '''wave energy converter''' (WEC).

Wave power is distinct from [[tidal power]], which captures the energy of the current caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon. Waves and tides are also distinct from [[ocean currents]] which are caused by other forces including [[wave breaking|breaking waves]], [[wind]], the [[Coriolis effect]], [[cabbeling]], and differences in [[temperature]] and [[salinity]].

Wave-power generation is not a widely employed commercial technology, although there have been attempts to use it since at least 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsidelands.org/wave-tidal3.php|title=Wave and Tidal Energy Experiments in San Francisco and Santa Cruz|author=Christine Miller|accessdate=2008-08-16|date=August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the world's first commercial Wave Power Device, the [[Islay LIMPET]] was installed on the coast of [[Islay]] in Scotland and connected to the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.edie.net/news/0/Worlds-first-commercial-wave-power-station-activated-in-Scotland/3492/&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2008, the first experimental multi-generator [[wave farm]] was opened in Portugal at the [[Aguçadoura Wave Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Joao Lima.

Waves are generated by wind passing over the surface of the sea. As long as the waves propagate slower than the wind speed just above the waves, there is an energy transfer from the wind to the waves. Both air pressure differences between the upwind and the lee side of a wave [[crest (physics)|crest]], as well as friction on the water surface by the wind, making the water to go into the [[shear stress]] causes the growth of the waves.&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;

[[Wave height]] is determined by wind speed, the duration of time the wind has been blowing, fetch (the distance over which the wind excites the waves) and by the depth and topography of the seafloor (which can focus or disperse the energy of the waves). A given wind speed has a matching practical limit over which time or distance will not produce larger waves. When this limit has been reached the sea is said to be "fully developed".

In general, larger waves are more powerful but wave power is also determined by wave speed, [[wavelength]], and water [[density]].

[[Ocean surface wave#Science of waves|Oscillatory motion]] is highest at the surface and diminishes exponentially with depth. However, for [[standing waves]] ([[clapotis]]) near a reflecting coast, wave energy is also present as pressure oscillations at great depth, producing [[microseism]]s.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite book| first=O.M. | last=Phillips | title=The dynamics of the upper ocean |publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1977 | edition=2nd | isbn=0-521-29801-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These pressure fluctuations at greater depth are too small to be interesting from the point of view of wave power.

The waves propagate on the ocean surface, and the wave energy is also transported horizontally with the [[group velocity]]. The mean transport rate of the wave energy through a vertical [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of unit width, parallel to a wave crest, is called the wave energy [[flux]] (or wave power, which must not be confused with the actual power generated by a wave power device).

=== Wave power formula ===

In deep water where the water depth is larger than half the [[wavelength]], the wave [[energy flux]] is&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The energy flux is &lt;math&gt;P = \tfrac{1}{16} \rho g H_{m0}^2 c_g,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;c_g&lt;/math&gt; the group velocity, see {{Cite book

When the significant wave height is given in metres, and the wave period in seconds, the result is the wave power in kilowatts (kW) per metre of [[wavefront]] length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Waves in ocean engineering|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford|isbn=0080435661|pages=35–36|author=Tucker, M.J.|edition=1st|author2=Pitt, E.G. |editor=Bhattacharyya, R. |editor2=McCormick, M.E.|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/EandE/Web_sites/01-02/RE_info/wave%20power.htm|title=Wave Power|publisher=[[University of Strathclyde]]|accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ocs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocsenergy.anl.gov/documents/docs/OCS_EIS_WhitePaper_Wave.pdf|format=PDF|title=Wave Energy Potential on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf|publisher=[[United States Department of the Interior]]|accessdate=2008-10-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711052514/http://ocsenergy.anl.gov/documents/docs/OCS_EIS_WhitePaper_Wave.pdf|archivedate=July 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/04/24110728/10 Academic Study: Matching Renewable Electricity Generation with Demand: Full Report].

Example: Consider moderate ocean swells, in deep water, a few km off a coastline,  with a wave height of 3 m and a wave energy period of 8 seconds. Using the formula to solve for power, we get

:&lt;math&gt;
  P \approx 0.5 \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{m}^3 \cdot \text{s}} (3 \cdot \text{m})^2 (8 \cdot \text{s}) \approx 36 \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{m}},
&lt;/math&gt;

meaning there are 36 kilowatts of power potential per meter of wave crest.

In major storms, the largest waves offshore are about 15 meters high and have a period of about 15 seconds. According to the above formula, such waves carry about 1.7&amp;nbsp;MW of power across each metre of wavefront.

An effective wave power device captures as much as possible of the wave energy flux. As a result, the waves will be of lower height in the region behind the wave power device.

=== Wave energy and wave-energy flux ===

In a [[sea state]], the average(mean) [[energy density]] per unit area of [[gravity wave]]s on the water surface is proportional to the wave height squared, according to linear wave theory:&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goda&gt;{{cite book | first=Y. | last=Goda | title=Random Seas and Design of Maritime Structures | year=2000 | publisher=World Scientific | isbn=978-981-02-3256-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{16}\rho g H_{m0}^2,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Here, the factor for random waves is {{frac|1|16}}, as opposed to {{frac|1|8}} for periodic waves – as explained hereafter. For a small-amplitude sinusoidal wave &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \eta=a\,\cos\, 2\pi\left(\frac{x}{\lambda}-\frac{t}{T}\right)&lt;/math&gt; with wave amplitude &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a,\,&lt;/math&gt; the wave energy density per unit horizontal area is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E=\frac{1}{2}\rho g a^2,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E=\frac{1}{8}\rho g H^2&lt;/math&gt; using the wave height &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H\,=\,2\,a\,&lt;/math&gt; for sinusoidal waves. In terms of the variance of the surface elevation &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m_0=\sigma_\eta^2=\overline{(\eta-\bar\eta)^2}=\frac{1}{2}a^2,&lt;/math&gt; the energy density is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E=\rho g m_0\,&lt;/math&gt;. Turning to random waves, the last formulation of the wave energy equation in terms of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m_0\,&lt;/math&gt; is also valid (Holthuijsen, 2007, p. 40), due to [[Parseval's theorem]]. Further, the [[significant wave height]] is ''defined'' as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H_{m0}=4\sqrt{m_0}&lt;/math&gt;, leading to the factor {{frac|1|16}} in the wave energy density per unit horizontal area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

where ''E'' is the mean wave energy density per unit horizontal area (J/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the sum of [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy]] density per unit horizontal area. The potential energy density is equal to the kinetic energy,&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt; both contributing half to the wave energy density ''E'', as can be expected from the [[Equipartition theorem#Potential energy and harmonic oscillators|equipartition theorem]]. In ocean waves, surface tension effects are negligible for wavelengths above a few [[decimetre]]s.

As the waves propagate, their energy is transported. The energy transport velocity is the [[group velocity]]. As a result, the wave energy [[flux]], through a vertical plane of unit width perpendicular to the wave propagation direction, is equal to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Reynolds |first=O. | authorlink=Osborne Reynolds | year=1877 |title=On the rate of progression of groups of waves and the rate at which energy is transmitted by waves | journal=Nature | volume=16 | pages=343–44 | doi = 10.1038/016341c0 |bibcode = 1877Natur..16R.341. }}&lt;br&gt;{{cite journal | title=On progressive waves | author=Lord Rayleigh (J.

with ''c&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' the group velocity (m/s).
Due to the [[dispersion (water waves)|dispersion relation]] for water waves under the action of gravity, the group velocity depends on the wavelength ''λ'', or equivalently, on the wave [[period (physics)|period]] ''T''. Further, the dispersion relation is a function of the water depth ''h''. As a result, the group velocity behaves differently in the limits of deep and shallow water, and at intermediate depths:&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goda/&gt;

=== Deep-water characteristics and opportunities ===

Deep water corresponds with a water depth larger than half the wavelength, which is the common situation in the sea and ocean. In deep water, longer-period waves propagate faster and transport their energy faster. The deep-water group velocity is half the [[phase velocity]]. In [[waves and shallow water|shallow water]], for wavelengths larger than about twenty times the water depth, as found quite often near the coast, the group velocity is equal to the phase velocity.&lt;ref name=Dean_Dalrymple&gt;{{cite book | title=Water wave mechanics for engineers and scientists |author1=R.

== History ==

The first known patent to use energy from ocean waves dates back to 1799, and was filed in Paris by [[Pierre-Simon Girard|Girard]] and his son.&lt;ref name=cle2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clément|year=2002 |title=Wave energy in Europe: current status and perspectives |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=405–431 |doi=10.1016/S1364-0321(02)00009-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early application of wave power was a device constructed around 1910 by Bochaux-Praceique to light and power his house at [[Royan]], near [[Bordeaux]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mech.ed.ac.uk/research/wavepower/0-Archive/EWPP%20archive/1976%20Leishman%20and%20Scobie%20NEL.pdf|format=PDF |title=The Development of Wave Power|accessdate=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that this was the first oscillating water-column type of wave-energy device.&lt;ref name=morris2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morris-Thomas |year=2007 |title=An Investigation Into the Hydrodynamic Efficiency of an Oscillating Water Column |journal=Journal of Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=273–278 |doi=10.1115/1.2426992 |last2=Irvin |first2=Rohan J. |last3=Thiagarajan |first3=Krish P.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1855 to 1973 there were already 340 patents filed in the UK alone.&lt;ref name=cle2002/&gt;

Modern scientific pursuit of wave energy was pioneered by [[Yoshio Masuda]]'s experiments in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamstec.go.jp/jamstec/MTD/Whale/ |title=Wave Energy Research and Development at JAMSTEC|accessdate=2009-12-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080701162330/http://www.jamstec.go.jp/jamstec/MTD/Whale/ |archivedate = July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tested various concepts of wave-energy devices at sea, with several hundred units used to power navigation lights. Among these was the concept of extracting power from the angular motion at the joints of an articulated raft, which was proposed in the 1950s by Masuda.&lt;ref name=ey2006&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.iwwwfb.org/Abstracts/iwwwfb21/iwwwfb21_15.pdf |author1=Farley, F.

A renewed interest in wave energy was motivated by the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis in 1973]]. A number of university researchers re-examined the potential to generate energy from ocean waves, among whom notably were [[Stephen Salter]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[Kjell Budal]] and [[Johannes Falnes]] from [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] (now merged into [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]]), [[Michael E. McCormick]] from [[U.S. Naval Academy]], [[David Evans (mathematician)|David Evans]] from [[Bristol University]], Michael French from [[University of Lancaster]], [[John Nicholas Newman|Nick Newman]] and [[C. C. Mei]] from [[MIT]].

Stephen Salter's [[1974 in science|1974 invention]] became known as [[Salter's duck]] or ''nodding duck'', although it was officially referred to as the Edinburgh Duck. In small scale controlled tests, the Duck's curved cam-like body can stop 90% of wave motion and can convert 90% of that to electricity giving 81% efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mech.ed.ac.uk/research/wavepower/EWPP%20archive/duck%20efficiency%20&amp;%20survival%20notes.pdf|format=PDF|title=Edinburgh Wave Energy Project|publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]]|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, as the oil price went down, wave-energy funding was drastically reduced. Nevertheless, a few first-generation prototypes were tested at sea. More recently, following the issue of climate change, there is again a growing interest worldwide for renewable energy, including wave energy.&lt;ref name=falnes2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Falnes, J. |year=2007 |title=A review of wave-energy extraction |journal=Marine Structures |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=185–201 |doi=10.1016/j.marstruc.2007.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to kick-start the development of a wave and tidal energy industry in the UK. Based in Orkney, Scotland, the [http://www.emec.org.uk/ European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC)] has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world. EMEC provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions. Its grid-connected wave test site is situated at Billia Croo, on the western edge of the Orkney mainland, and is subject to the full force of the Atlantic Ocean with seas as high as 19 metres recorded at the site. Wave energy developers currently testing at the centre include [http://www.aquamarinepower.com/ Aquamarine Power], [http://www.pelamiswave.com/ Pelamis Wave Power], [http://www.emec.org.uk/about-us/wave-clients/scottishpower-renewables/ ScottishPower Renewables] and [http://www.wello.eu/ Wello].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emec.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern technology ==

Wave power devices are generally categorized by the '''method''' used to capture the energy of the waves, by '''location''' and by the '''power take-off system'''. Locations are shoreline, nearshore and offshore. Types of power take-off include: [[hydraulic ram]], [[Peristaltic pump|elastomeric hose pump]], pump-to-shore, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric turbine]], air turbine,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060523114110/http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/fall2003/ece441/groups/g12/White_Papers/Kelly.htm Embedded Shoreline Devices and Uses as Power Generation Sources] ''Kimball, Kelly, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Linear motor|linear electrical generator]]. When evaluating [[wave energy]] as a technology type, it is important to distinguish between the four most common approaches: point absorber buoys, surface attenuators, oscillating water columns, and overtopping devices.

[[File:Wave energy concepts overview numbered.png|thumb|300px|Generic wave energy concepts: 1. Point absorber, 2. Attenuator, 3. Oscillating wave surge converter, 4. Oscillating water column, 5. Overtopping device, 6. Submerged pressure differential]]

=== Point absorber buoy ===

This device floats on the surface of the [[water]], held in place by cables connected to the seabed. The point-absorber is deﬁned as having a device width much smaller than the incoming wavelength λ. A good point absorber has the same characteristics as a good wave-maker. The wave energy is absorbed by radiating a wave with destructive interference to the incoming waves. Buoys use the rise and fall of swells to generate [[electricity]] in various ways including directly via [[linear alternator|linear generators]],&lt;ref name="Seabased"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seabased AB wave energy technology|url=http://www.seabased.com/en/technology/seabased-wave-energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; or via generators driven by mechanical linear-to-rotary converters&lt;ref name="PowerBuoy"&gt;{{cite web|title=PowerBuoy Technology — Ocean Power Technologies|url=http://www.oceanpowertechnologies.com/powerbuoy-technology/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or hydraulic pumps.&lt;ref name="CETO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Perth Wave Energy Project - Carnegie’s CETO Wave Energy technology|url=https://arena.gov.au/projects/perth-wave-energy-project/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electromagnetic field|EMF]] generated by electrical transmission cables and acoustics of these devices may be a concern for marine organisms. The presence of the buoys may affect fish, marine mammals, and birds as potential minor collision risk and roosting sites. Potential also exists for entanglement in mooring lines. Energy removed from the waves may also affect the shoreline, resulting in a recommendation that sites remain a considerable distance from the shore.&lt;ref name="Tethys"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/technology-type/wave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface attenuator ===

These devices act similarly to [[Wave power#Point absorber buoy|point absorber buoys]], with multiple floating segments connected to one another and are oriented perpendicular to incoming waves. A flexing motion is created by swells that drive hydraulic pumps to generate electricity. Environmental effects are similar to those of point absorber buoys, with an additional concern that organisms could be pinched in the joints.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=== Oscillating wave surge converter ===

These devices typically have one end fixed to a structure or the seabed while the other end is free to move. [[Energy]] is collected from the relative motion of the body compared to the fixed point. Oscillating wave surge converters often come in the form of floats, flaps, or membranes. Environmental concerns include minor risk of collision, artificial reefing near the fixed point, [[Electromotive force|EMF]] effects from subsea cables, and energy removal effecting sediment transport.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt; Some of these designs incorporate [[parabolic reflector]]s as a means of increasing the wave energy at the point of capture. These capture systems use the rise and fall motion of waves to capture energy.&lt;ref name="Renewable Sea Power"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=McCormick |first1=Michael E. |first2=R. Cengiz |last2=Ertekin |title=Renewable sea power: Waves, tides, and thermals – new research funding seeks to put them to work for us |journal=Mechanical Engineering |publisher=ASME |volume=131 |issue=5 |year=2009 |pages=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the wave energy is captured at a wave source, power must be carried to the point of use or to a connection to the [[electrical grid]] by [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] [[submarine power cable|power cables]].&lt;ref name=nyt20100316&gt;

=== Oscillating water column ===

[[Oscillating Water Column]] devices can be located on shore or in deeper waters offshore. With an air chamber integrated into the device, swells compress air in the chambers forcing air through an air turbine to create [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="“grnflea"&gt;{{cite web|title=Extracting Energy From Ocean Waves|url=http://grnflea.com/extracting-energy-from-ocean-waves/|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant noise is produced as air is pushed through the turbines, potentially affecting [[birds]] and other [[marine organisms]] within the vicinity of the device. There is also concern about marine organisms getting trapped or entangled within the air chambers.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=== Overtopping device ===

Overtopping devices are long structures that use wave velocity to fill a reservoir to a greater water level than the surrounding ocean. The potential energy in the reservoir height is then captured with low-head turbines. Devices can be either on shore or floating offshore. Floating devices will have environmental concerns about the mooring system affecting [[benthic organism]]s, organisms becoming entangled, or EMF effects produced from [[subsea cable]]s. There is also some concern regarding low levels of turbine noise and wave energy removal affecting the nearfield habitat.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=== Submerged pressure differential ===
Submerged pressure differential based converters are a comparatively newer technology &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurniawan|first=Adi|last2=Greaves|first2=Deborah|last3=Chaplin|first3=John|date=2014-12-08|title=Wave energy devices with compressible volumes|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/470/2172/20140559|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|language=en|volume=470|issue=2172|pages=20140559|doi=10.1098/rspa.2014.0559|issn=1364-5021|pmc=4241014|pmid=25484609|bibcode=2014RSPSA.47040559K}}&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing flexible (usually reinforced rubber) membranes to extract wave energy. These converters use the difference in pressure at different locations below a wave to produce a pressure difference within a closed power take-off fluid system. This pressure difference is usually used to produce flow, which drives a turbine and electrical generator. Submerged pressure differential converters frequently use flexible membranes as the working surface between the ocean and the power take-off system. Membranes offer the advantage over rigid structures of being compliant and low mass, which can produce more direct coupling with the wave’s energy. Their compliant nature also allows for large changes in the geometry of the working surface, which can be used to tune the response of the converter for specific wave conditions and to protect it from excessive loads in extreme conditions.

A submerged converter may be positioned either on the sea floor or in midwater. In both cases, the converter is protected from water impact loads which can occur at the [[free surface]]. Wave loads also diminish in [[Nonlinear system|non-linear]] proportion to the distance below the free surface. This means that by optimizing the depth of submergence for such a converter, a compromise between protection from extreme loads and access to wave energy can be found. Submerged WECs also have the potential to reduce the impact on marine amenity and navigation, as they are not at the surface. Examples of submerged pressure differential converters include [http://www.m3wave.com/m3tech M3 Wave], [http://www.bomborawave.com Bombora Wave Power]'s mWave, and [http://calwave.energy CalWave].

== Environmental effects ==

{{further|Environmental impact of electricity generation#Wave}}

Common environmental concerns associated with [[marine energy]] developments include:

* The risk of [[marine mammal]]s and [[fish]] being struck by tidal [[turbine]] blades;
* The effects of [[electromagnetic field|EMF]] and underwater noise emitted from operating marine energy devices;
* The physical presence of [[marine energy]] projects and their potential to alter the behavior of marine mammals, fish, and [[seabird]]s with attraction or avoidance;
* The potential effect on nearfield and farfield marine environment and processes such as [[sediment transport]] and [[water quality]].

The [[Tethys (database)|Tethys database]] provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of wave energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/wiki/index.php/Tethys_Home|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110141934/http://tethys.pnnl.gov/wiki/index.php/Tethys_Home|archivedate=November 10, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential ==

The worldwide resource of coastal wave energy has been estimated to be greater than 2 TW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gunn |first=Kester |last2=Stock-Williams |first2=Clym |date=August 2012 |title=Quantifying the global wave power resource |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148112001310 |journal=Renewable Energy |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=44 |pages=296–304 |access-date=27 February 2015 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2012.01.101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Locations with the most potential for wave power include the western seaboard of Europe, the northern coast of the UK, and the Pacific coastlines of North and South America, Southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The north and south [[temperate zones]] have the best sites for capturing wave power. The prevailing [[westerlies]] in these zones blow strongest in winter.

There is a potential impact on the marine environment. Noise pollution, for example, could have negative impact if not monitored, although the noise and visible impact of each design vary greatly.&lt;ref name="ocs"/&gt; Other biophysical impacts (flora and fauna, sediment regimes and water column structure and flows) of scaling up the technology are being studied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/programmes/mre/background.asp Marine Renewable Energy Programme], [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]] Retrieved 2011-08-01&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of socio-economic challenges, wave farms can result in the displacement of commercial and recreational fishermen from productive fishing grounds, can change the pattern of beach sand nourishment, and may represent hazards to safe navigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Hackett]]:''Economic and Social Considerations for Wave Energy Development in California'' [http://www.energy.ca.gov/2008publications/CEC-500-2008-083/CEC-500-2008-083.PDF CEC Report Nov 2008] Ch2, pp22-44 [[California Energy Commission]]|Retrieved 2008-12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Waves generate about 2,700 gigawatts of power. Of those 2,700 gigawatts, only about 500 gigawatts can be captured with the current technology.&lt;ref name="Renewable Sea Power"/&gt; Since 2008, Seabased Industry AB (SIAB) has deployed several units of wave energy converters (WECs) manufactured with different designs. Offshore deployments of WECs and underswater substation are being complicated procedures. SIAB discussed these deployments in terms of economy and time efficiency, as well as safety. Certain solutions are suggested for the various problems encountered during the deployments. It is found that the offshore deployment process can be optimized in terms of cost, time efficiency and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chatzigiannakou|first=Maria Angeliki|last2=Dolguntseva|first2=Irina|last3=Leijon|first3=Mats|date=2017-03-25|title=Offshore Deployments of Wave Energy Converters by Seabased Industry AB|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/5/2/15|journal=Journal of Marine Science and Engineering|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=15|doi=10.3390/jmse5020015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wave farms ==

{{Main|Wave farm}}A group of wave energy devices deployed in the same location is called [[wave farm]], wave power farm or wave energy park. Wave farms represent a solution to achieve larger electricity production. The devices of a park are going to interact with each other hydrodynamically and electrically, according to the number of machines, the distance among them, the geometric layout, the wave climate, the local geometry,  the control strategies. The design process of a wave energy farm is a multi-[[optimization problem]] with the aim to get a high power production and low costs and power fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giassi|first=Marianna|last2=Göteman|first2=Malin|date=April 2018|title=Layout design of wave energy parks by a genetic algorithm|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.01.096|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=154|pages=252–261|doi=10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.01.096|issn=0029-8018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave farm projects ===

==== United Kingdom ====

* The [[Islay LIMPET]] was installed and connected to the National Grid in 2000 and is the world's first commercial Wave Power installation
* Funding for a {{nowrap|3 MW}} wave farm in Scotland was announced on February 20, 2007, by the [[Scottish Executive]], at a cost of over 4 million [[pound sterling|pounds]], as part of a £13 million funding package for [[Renewable energy in Scotland#Wave power|marine power in Scotland]]. The first machine was launched in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Fyall, Jenny | title = 600ft 'sea snake' to harness power of Scotland |work=The Scotsman | date = May 19, 2010 | pages = 10–11 | url = http://news.scotsman.com/scotland/600ft-39sea-snake39-to-harness.6303096.jp | accessdate = 2010-05-19 | location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A facility known as [[Wave hub]] has been constructed off the north coast of Cornwall, England, to facilitate wave energy development. The Wave hub will act as giant extension cable, allowing arrays of wave energy generating devices to be connected to the electricity grid. The Wave hub will initially allow {{nowrap|20 MW}} of capacity to be connected, with potential expansion to {{nowrap|40 MW}}. Four device manufacturers have so far expressed interest in connecting to the Wave hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Wave farm wins £21.5m grant |work=The Guardian | date=April 26, 2007 | author=James Sturcke | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/apr/26/energy.uknews | accessdate=2009-04-08 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Tender problems delaying Wave Hub |publisher=BBC News | date=April 2, 2008 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cornwall/7326971.stm | accessdate=2009-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scientists have calculated that wave energy gathered at Wave Hub will be enough to power up to 7,500 households. The site has the potential to save greenhouse gas emissions of about 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide in the next 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Go-ahead for £28m Cornish wave farm|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/sep/17/renewableenergy.uknews|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-10-12 | location=London | date=September 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2017 study by [[Strathclyde University]] and [[Imperial College]] focused on the failure to develop "market ready" wave energy devices – despite a UK government push of over £200 million in the preceding 15 years – and how to improve the effectiveness of future government support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.scotsman.com/news/environment/government-s-200m-wave-energy-plan-undermined-by-failures-1-4602617 | newspaper=The Scotsman | title=Government’s £200m wave energy plan undermined by failures | date=November 2, 2017 | accessdate=2017-12-05 | author=Scott Macnab }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Portugal ====

* The [[Aguçadoura Wave Farm]] was the world's first [[wave farm]]. It was located {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} offshore near [[Póvoa de Varzim]], north of [[Porto]], Portugal. The farm was designed to use three [[Pelamis wave energy converter|Pelamis]] wave energy converters to convert the motion of the [[ocean surface wave]]s into electricity, totalling to {{nowrap|2.25 [[Megawatt|MW]]}} in total installed capacity. The farm first generated electricity in July 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Electricity Generation in Portugal|url=http://www.pelamiswave.com/news?archive=1&amp;mm=7&amp;yy=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was officially opened on September 23, 2008, by the Portuguese Minister of Economy.&lt;ref name="gov.pt"&gt;{{cite web|title=23 de Setembro de 2008|url=http://www.portugal.gov.pt/portal/pt/comunicacao/agenda/20080923.htm|publisher=[[Government of Portugal]]|accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Making waves: UK firm harnesses power of the sea ... in Portugal | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/25/greentech.alternativeenergy |work=The Guardian | accessdate=2008-10-09 | location=London | first=Alok | last=Jha | date=September 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wave farm was shut down two months after the official opening in November 2008 as a result of the financial collapse of [[Babcock &amp; Brown]] due to the global economic crisis. The machines were off-site at this time due to technical problems, and although resolved have not returned to site and were subsequently scrapped in 2011 as the technology had moved on to the P2 variant as supplied to [[E.ON]] and [[Scottish Renewables]].&lt;ref name="Pelamis Sinks"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pelamis Sinks Portugal Wave Power|url=http://www.cleantech.com/news/4276/pelamis-sinks-portugal-wave-power-p|publisher=Cleantech|accessdate=2016-09-15|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321113455/http://www.cleantech.com/news/4276/pelamis-sinks-portugal-wave-power-p|archivedate=March 21, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second phase of the project planned to increase the installed capacity to {{nowrap|21 MW}} using a further 25 Pelamis machines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Babcock, EDP and Efacec to Collaborate on Wave Energy Projects|author=Joao Lima|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601081&amp;sid=aSsaOB9qbiKE&amp;refer=australia|publisher=[[Bloomberg Television]]|accessdate=2008-09-24|date=September 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in doubt following Babcock's financial collapse.
