{{About|literary use of the phrase|1917 painting by Paul Klee|Ab ovo (painting)|biological alternative to spontaneous generation|Omne vivum ex ovo}}
[[File:Leda and the Swan 1505-1510.jpg|thumb|''Leda and the Swan'', a painting depicting Helen's unconventional birth, by [[Cesare da Sesto]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1506&amp;ndash;1510, [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]]) after a lost painting by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Helen and [[Clytemnestra]] are shown emerging from one egg; [[Castor and Pollux]] from another.]]
'''''Ab ovo''''' ([[Latin]]: "from the beginning, the origin, the [[egg (biology)|egg]]") is a reference to one of the twin eggs from which [[Helen of Troy#Birth|Helen of Troy was born]]. The eggs were laid by [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] after mating with [[Zeus]] disguised as a swan. Had [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] not laid the egg, [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] would not have been born, so [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] could not have eloped with her, so there would have been no [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;Helen of Troy: From Homer to Hollywood. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. Chichester, West Sussex, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature ==

The [[English language|English]] literary use of the phrase comes from [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', where he describes his ideal epic poet as one who "does not begin the Trojan War from the double egg" (''nec gemino bellum Troianum orditur ab ouo''), the absolute beginning of events, the earliest possible chronological point, but snatches the listener into the middle of things (''[[in medias res]]''). This advice is famously rejected in [[Laurence Sterne]]'s novel [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]].

This use is distinct from the longer phrase ''[[ab ovo usque ad mala]]'' (lit. "from the egg to the apples") which appears in Horace's [[Sermonum liber primus|''Satire'']] 1.3.  It refers to the course of a Roman meal, which often began with eggs and ended with fruit, and is similar to the American English phrase "[[wikt:from soup to nuts#Adverb|soup to nuts]]".  Thus ''ab ovo'' can also be used to mean a complete or entire thing.

Merkle completed his degree in [[economics]] in 1948 at the  [[University of Fribourg]] and obtained his Ph.D. in 1950 under the supervision of [[Josef Schwarzfischer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unifr.ch/webnews/content/20/attach/1119.pdf |title=Adolphe Merkle |language=German |access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 27 he went into the real estate business and discovered the company [[VibroMeter]] in [[Villars-sur-Glâne]], which developed and fabricated measuring instruments. He became the sole shareholder and CEO of the company, that from the 1960s on manufactured with great succes specialized instruments for the automobile and aviation industries and in 1990 for the [[heavy-lift launch vehicle|heavy-lift rocket]] [[Ariane 5]]. In 1991 Merkle sold the majority of his share to [[Elektrowatt]] and retired from the company's management in 1998 after its sale to [[Meggitt PLC]].&lt;ref name=Liberté&gt;''{{cite web |url=http://www.laliberte.ch/regions/adolphe-merkle-la-mort-d-un-visionnaire |title=Adolphe Merkle: la mort d'un visionnaire |archive-date=2012-02-24 |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224034011/http://www.laliberte.ch/regions/adolphe-merkle-la-mort-d-un-visionnaire |language=French |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Ageless''' is an adjective describing a person or thing whose [[ageing|age]] cannot be defined, is non-existent, or appears not to change. It can also describe something that has always existed without a precise beginning or an end.

Agelessness can be used as a synonym for [[immortality]]; more specifically it refers to [[eternal youth]].

==Ageless people==
Agelessness can be attributed to individuals whose physical or mental characteristics appear young for their biological age.

The [[Castrati]] singers of the [[Renaissance]] aged differently from other men due to the lack of [[testosterone]] and other hormones, which may have altered their appearance and stature. Specifically, [[Alessandro Moreschi]] (1858–1922) was described as having no facial hair and a childish voice and appearance.

===Modern examples===
The illusion of agelessness seems to be a goal for many individuals, such as [[Hollywood]] celebrities, that have been known to strive for, sometimes undergoing extensive and/or risky cosmetic surgeries. [[Demi Moore]], [[Naomi Campbell]], [[Eminem]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] are particularly mentioned in the media for their alleged efforts to appear 'forever young'. Television host [[Dick Clark]] was often described as "America's Oldest Teenager."  Many of his viewers report difficulty in perceiving typical signs of aging since the 1960s, despite him being born in 1929. The age of [[Andy Milonakis]] is also ambiguous to many viewers since he is known to possess a hormone disorder, which allows him to perform the role of a young teenager in his shows despite being much older. Another celebrity who is commonly described as having the appearance of a teenager is the actor [[Eddie Redmayne]], born 1982, due to his virtual lack of [[facial hair|beard growth]], causing many people to report he appears no older than 20 years of age.

Actor [[Suzanne Somers]] attributes her youthful appearance to the use of [[bioidentical hormone replacement therapy]]. Her 2006 book ''Ageless'' continues the theme of her 2004 book ''The Sexy Years'' that restoring [[hormone]]s (especially [[sex steroid|sex hormone]]s) to youthful levels is the primary key to an ageless appearance.

===Methods to achieve agelessness===
[[Cosmetics]] exist largely to supposedly aid in attempts to diminish the effects of age. The use of such cosmetics has been known to sometimes create conflicting age indicators (for example, red hair belonging to a wrinkled face), making age determination difficult.

[[Botox]], [[silicone]] implants, [[tummy tuck]]s, [[facelift]]s, and [[nosejob]]s are examples of surgeries that attempt to remove the signs of aging.  Sooner or later, however, the effects of the passing years do start to show on the body as it endures wear and tear. Scientists all over the world are also working on finding the [[senescence|reason of aging]] and have developed various theories, however, much more research is needed before this phenomenon can be fully understood and potentially controlled.

==Mythology==
Gods and goddesses were considered eternal in many ancient mythologies, and were endowed with [[eternal youth]]. In [[Greek mythology]], agelessness was achieved by the gods' eating [[ambrosia]] (immortality was derived from their blood, [[ichor]]); in [[Norse mythology]], by the gods eating golden apples provided by [[Iðunn]]; and in [[Chinese mythology]], by the gods consuming the [[Peaches of Immortality]].

==Media and fiction==

===Comics and cartoons===
Agelessness is prominent in [[anime]], [[manga]], [[cartoon]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[comic strip]]s, and other illustrated media. Characters and situations are staged in an [[presentism (philosophy of time)|eternal present]] where change and causality are considered arbitrary and disposable. Ageless characters in comic books often appear as [[superhero]]es, deriving immortal or timeless properties from accelerated or supernatural healing, [[time travel]], [[interdimensional travel|interdimensional]] origin, and other fictional devices. In comics and cartoons, agelessness is sometimes used to preserve continuity in a [[floating timeline]] or an [[episode|episodic format]] respectively. For example, Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny are ageless cartoon and comic characters.

===Pulp literature===
Long-running series of [[pulp magazine|pulp novels]] can develop ageless characters. The main characters in [[The Hardy Boys]] have remained 17 and 18, and have been located approximately in the "present day" since 1926. The same can be said for [[Nancy Drew|The Nancy Drew series]]. Nancy has remained 18 years old for many decades (although she started out at the age of 16).

[[James Bond]] is also known by many as an ageless character. Some of his ally characters, including [[M (James Bond)|M]], [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], [[Miss Moneypenny]], [[Bill Tanner]] and [[Felix Leiter]] also do not age throughout both the novel and film series, which began in 1953 and 1962 respectively. [[Ian Fleming]], the creator of Bond, tinkered with details of Bond's early life and changed dates to ensure Bond was always the appropriate age for his stories, a practice called [[retconning]].

===Fantasy literature===
[[Tolkien]]'s [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] are an iconic example of creatures who are ageless. They are not subject to [[entropy]] and decay, unlike [[Edain|Men]] and the rest of the [[Middle-earth]]. Tolkien described his elves as young-looking, yet with some properties of 'wisdom' and experience in their eyes and behaviour; Tolkien also stated that Elves do experience change and aging—not by growing old, but by altering other features of their appearance. The combination of physical youth and immense mental maturity can render the perceived age of an Elf undefinable and alien by mortal standards.

The [[Aes Sedai]] of [[Robert Jordan]]'s [[The Wheel of Time|''Wheel of Time'']] series are described as ageless. A feature of their magical abilities extends life and makes their age difficult to place despite their white hair and physical frailty.

===Television and soap operas===
On television, the process of a character (usually a child) aging unusually fast has been a common feature in [[soap operas]] and is known as [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome]] or "SORAS". The reverse effect, where characters fail to age at the typical rate they should or in fact become younger, is known by a more recent, opposite term known as [[de-SORAS]].  On the British television show [[Doctor Who]], which involves time travel, all of the Doctor's incarnations appear not to age, except for the First Doctor. It's also implied on [[Sarah Jane Adventures]] episode [[Death of the Doctor]] that the Doctor's first companions Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright have never aged since their travels; Also, despite the fact that 10 years of the life of the Pond-Williams passed between [[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]] and  [[The Angels Take Manhattan]], they didn't show any major traits associated with aging. Several characters on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] 2011 TV series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' do not age, either through the effects of the Dark Curse or spending time in [[Neverland]]; in the case of [[Killian Jones|Hook]], both are true. Other characters, such as [[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin]] or [[Merlin]] and his [[The Sorcerer's Apprentice|apprentice]], do not age due to the fact that they possess [[immortality]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2284">'''Airwave novels''' are stories told over [[radio broadcast]]s. It is a term mostly used within [[Culture of Hong Kong|Hong Kong culture]]. The stories can be anywhere from 15 minutes to hours long.

==History==
The first radio station to offer airwave novel entertainment in Hong Kong was [[Radio Rediffusion]]. [[Li Ngaw]] is generally considered the pioneer of the Chinese story broadcast format.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, Grant. Tam, Maria. [1997] (1997). Hong Kong: the anthropology of a Chinese metropolis. {{ISBN|0-7007-0601-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he did not begin the art in Hong Kong as he was already doing the story broadcasts in [[Guangzhou]], [[China]].&lt;ref name="lcsd"&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/HKFA/english/newsletter/nl08_2.html lcsd.gov.hk]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The art form was popular in Hong Kong during the [[1950s in Hong Kong|1950s]].&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

The term ''"Airwave novel"'' was first suggested by director Yam Wu-fa, when he bought the rights to [[Crime Doesn't Pay]] in 1949. The film originally started out as the airwave novel titled [[Flame of Lust]] by Li Ngaw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/HKFA/english/newsletter02/nl27_2.html lcsd newsletter]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present==
Today radio stations in Hong Kong continue to broadcast stories. The format largely consist of [[Mogwai (Chinese culture)|mogwai]] and [[jiangshi]] tales (鬼故, literally Ghost tales). A number of [[Taxicabs of Hong Kong|Hong Kong taxi]] drivers do tune into the shows regularly, since radio remains to be their main form of entertainment. The stories are also for people with a deep interest in [[urban legend]] type haunted stories. The format, however, is considered an older style alternative entertainment to present day [[internet]], [[television]] etc.

'''Aromachology''' is the study of the influence of odors on human [[behavior]] and to examine the relationship between feelings and emotions. It analyzes emotions as relaxation, exhilaration, sensuality, happiness and well-being brought about by odors stimulating the olfactory pathways in the brain and, in particular, the limbic system.&lt;ref name="wang"&gt;C. X. Wang, Sh. L. Chen, Aromachology and its Application in the Textile Field, http://www.fibtex.lodz.pl/54_14_41.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Different wearers are thought to have unique physiological and psychological responses to scents, especially those not manufactured synthetically but based on real scents.&lt;ref&gt;Celia Lyttleton, ''The Scent Trail'', (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-85750-031-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "aromachology" is derived from "aroma" and "physio-psychology", the latter being the study of aroma.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shiseido.co.jp/e/e9803kor/html/kor01100.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This term was coined in 1989 by what is now the [[Sense of Smell Institute]] (SSI), a division of [[The Fragrance Foundation]].&lt;ref name="lis-balchin"&gt;Maria Lis-Balchin, Aromatherapy Science: a Guide for Healthcare Professionals, p. 3, (2006), {{ISBN|0-85369-578-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSI defines aromachology as 'a concept based on systematic, scientific data collected under controlled conditions'. The term is defined as the scientifically observable influence of smell on emotions and moods. Consumers use aromachology to alleviate time pressures, for relaxation or stimulation and as a component of other activities that generate a feeling of well-being.&lt;ref name="homeaccentstoday"&gt;"Aromachology? (The consumer counts: fragrance)." Home Accents Today, May 2003, p. 34. General OneFile, http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A102520043/ITOF?u=miam11506&amp;sid=ITOF&amp;xid=f0f92b9d. Accessed 21 Oct. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although certain plants are known through studies in aromatherapy to have [[stimulant|stimulating]] or relaxing effects, research on wider scopes of application for therapeutic purposes are still at an early stage. Aromachology devotees want to find out how psychological effects are transmitted from scent to the brain, as well as how positive behavioral effects can be induced by scent.&lt;ref name="lis-balchin"/&gt; Maria Lis-Bachin, author of ''Aromatherapy Science: a Guide for Healthcare Professionals'', notes an overlap between the objectives of aromatherapy and those of aromachology.&lt;ref name="lis-balchin"/&gt; However, despite this apparent overlapping, academic authors believe that they are distinct branches of research and application, with each having its own research methods and directions.&lt;ref name="wang"/&gt;

==Aromatherapy vs. Aromachology==
The history of [[aromatherapy]] goes back to [[Ancient Egypt]]. People for years have used [[essential oils]] to treat their psychological and physical well-being. In Ancient Egypt, people used essential oils for cosmetic and medicinal products. Civilizations from around the globe also used aromatherapy for therapeutic purposes.
The term aromatherapy dates from the 20th century when French chemist Jean-Maurice Gattefosse rediscovered the healing powers of lavender's essential oil by trying to relieve a severe burn. Aromatherapy requires the incorporation of essential oils and plant-based essentials for therapeutic and [[holistic]] process assuring the well-being of the mind and body.&lt;ref name="warda"&gt;Warda, R. (2002). Aromatherapy vs. Aromachology: the difference between natural essential oils and synthetic fragrances can mean the difference in offering consumers true aromatherapeutic benefits. Global Cosmetic Industry, (11), 58. Retrieved from http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edsgao&amp;AN=edsgcl.94769201&amp;site=eds-live&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Aromachology is the term [[The Fragrance Foundation]] and the [[Sense of Smell Institute]], both based in [[New York City|New York]], assigned in 1989&lt;ref name="homeaccentstoday"/&gt; to the concern about the scents and the [[wikt:psyche|psyche]] behavior because of odors. Aromachology is a relatively new science that explores positive feelings induced by odors far from any holistic or healing process. The term also covers, both, natural and synthetic scents. The term aromachology is sometimes mistaken by companies with several other terms such as "essential oils" or "aromatherapy" as [[marketing]] phrases. The products shouldn't be labeled other than aromachology because they do not offer healing or holistic benefits.&lt;ref name="warda"/&gt;

==Aromachology and human behavior==
A Journal of Society of Cosmetic Chemists of Japan in 1992 &lt;ref name="tanida"&gt;谷田正弘, 菊池晶夫, 上野山重治, 阿部恒之, 山口浩, Tanida, M., … Yamaguchi, H. (1992). アロマコロジーの化粧品への応用　（１）　香りが反応予期事態の心拍変動パターンに対して及ぼす影響. 日本化粧品技術者会誌, 26(2), 113–119. {{doi|10.5107/sccj.26.113}}&lt;/ref&gt; realized a study to show how humans behave based on the scent they are exposed to. On the study, the effect of odor on cardiac response patterns was investigated on human subjects during a period of two-stimulus paradigm in a simple reaction time task. 
During the experiment changes in the cardiac response pattern were obvious and heart rate deceleration reflecting the process of anticipation or attention. 
Olfactory stimulation was provided to the subjects with different aromatic air samples with a 5-second rest period, followed by a 20-second olfactory stimulus period. It was concluded that the odor of lemon, traditionally thought to be stimulative, had the effect of activating anticipation or attention process. The effect of activating the anticipation or attention process was stronger when the odor intensity was more concentrated. On the other hand, the rose odor initially was thought to be sedative, had the effect of suppressing that process.&lt;ref name="tanida"/&gt;

==Commercial application of aromachology==
From the point of view of creating a scent for the body, a number of aromachology practitioners and small companies interested in aromachology are focused on creating bespoke perfumes for individuals who are less interested in purchasing the same fragrances that every other person is wearing and more inclined to wearing a perfume tailored precisely to their own preferences, memories and scent matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.financialpost.com/entrepreneur/Aromachology+scent+their/2698738/story.html | title=Aromachology: A scent of their own| date=2010-03-17| last1=Subramaniam| first1=Vanmala}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cosmetic brands such as [[Shiseido]] and Décléor are devoting substantial efforts to the task of finding out the beneficial properties of aromas on our sense of well-being and health. [[Shiseido]] currently has a skincare line called "The Skincare" that uses aromachology in their products. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Broader applications for aromachology are found in industries that introduce scent into products other than cosmetics or perfumes. Aromachology is considered to also encompass scents introduced to home fragrances, textiles, drawer liners and odor reducers for the home environment.&lt;ref name="wang"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12390">[[File:Brown lady.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Brown Lady of Raynham Hall'' claimed photograph of the ghost, Captain Hubert C. Provand. First published in [[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]], 1936]]

The '''Brown Lady of Raynham Hall''' is a [[ghost]] that reportedly haunts [[Raynham Hall]] in [[Norfolk]], England. 
It became one of the most famous hauntings in [[Great Britain]] when photographers from ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine claimed to have captured its image. The "Brown Lady" is so named because of the brown [[brocade]] dress it is claimed she wears.

==Identity of the ghost==
[[File:Lady Dorothy Walpole.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Lady Dorothy Walpole by [[Charles Jervas]]]]
According to legend, the "Brown Lady of Raynham Hall" is the ghost of [[Dorothy Townshend|Lady Dorothy Walpole]] (1686–1726), the sister of [[Robert Walpole]], generally regarded as the first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister of Great Britain]]. She was the second wife of [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]], who was notorious for his violent temper. The story says that when Townshend discovered that his wife had committed [[adultery]] with [[Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton|Lord Wharton]] he punished her by locking her in her rooms in the family home, Raynham Hall. According to [[Mary Wortley Montagu]], Dorothy was in fact entrapped by the Countess of Wharton. She invited Dorothy over to stay for a few days knowing that her husband would never allow her to leave, not even to see her children. She remained at Raynham Hall until her death in 1726 from [[smallpox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown Lady of Raynham|url=http://home.worldonline.co.za/~townshend/dorothywalpole.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sightings==
The first recorded claim of a sighting of the ghost was by Lucia C. Stone concerning a gathering at [[Raynham Hall]] in the Christmas of 1835. Stone says that Lord Charles Townshend had invited various guests to the Hall, including a Colonel Loftus, to join in the Christmas festivities. Loftus and another guest named Hawkins said they had seen the "Brown Lady" one night as they approached their bedrooms, noting in particular the dated brown dress she wore. The following evening Loftus claimed to have seen the "Brown Lady" again, later reporting that on this occasion he was drawn to the spectre's empty eye-sockets, dark in the glowing face. Loftus' sightings led to some staff permanently leaving Raynham Hall.&lt;ref name=Mysterious&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/england/norfolk/hauntings/the-brown-lady-of-raynham-hall.html# |title=Parkinson, Daniel ''Mysterious Britain &amp; Ireland'' website |access-date=2010-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726052925/http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/england/norfolk/hauntings/the-brown-lady-of-raynham-hall.html# |archive-date=2011-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.castleofspirits.com/brownlady.html# |title=Brown Lady of Raynham Hall - Castle of Spirits |access-date=2010-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208085649/http://www.castleofspirits.com/brownlady.html# |archive-date=2013-02-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Frederick Marryat by John Simpson.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frederick Marryat]] claimed to have seen the ''Brown Lady'' in 1836]]

The next reported sighting of the "Brown Lady" was made in 1836 by Captain [[Frederick Marryat]], a friend of [[novel]]ist [[Charles Dickens]], and the author of a series of popular sea novels. It is said that Marryat requested that he spend the night in the haunted room at Raynham Hall to prove his theory that the haunting was caused by local smugglers anxious to keep people away from the area. Writing in 1891, [[Florence Marryat]] said of her father's experience:

{{Quote|…he took possession of the room in which the portrait of the apparition hung, and in which she had been often seen, and slept each night with a loaded revolver under his pillow. For two days, however, he saw nothing, and the third was to be the limit of his stay. On the third night, however, two young men (nephews of the baronet), knocked at his door as he was undressing to go to bed, and asked him to step over to their room (which was at the other end of the corridor), and give them his opinion on a new gun just arrived from London. My father was in his shirt and trousers, but as the hour was late, and everybody had retired to rest except themselves, he prepared to accompany them as he was. As they were leaving the room, he caught up his revolver, “in case you meet the Brown Lady,” he said, laughing. When the inspection of the gun was over, the young men in the same spirit declared they would accompany my father back again, “in case you meet the Brown Lady,” they repeated, laughing also. The three gentlemen therefore returned in company.

The corridor was long and dark, for the lights had been extinguished, but as they reached the middle of it, they saw the glimmer of a lamp coming towards them from the other end. “One of the ladies going to visit the nurseries,” whispered the young Townshends to my father. Now the bedroom doors in that corridor faced each other, and each room had a double door with a space between, as is the case in many old-fashioned houses. My father, as I have said, was in shirt and trousers only, and his native modesty made him feel uncomfortable, so he slipped within one of the ''outer'' doors (his friends following his example), in order to conceal himself until the lady should have passed by.

I have heard him describe how he watched her approaching nearer and nearer, through the chink of the door, until, as she was close enough for him to distinguish the colors and style of her costume, he recognised the figure as the facsimile of the portrait of “The Brown Lady”. He had his finger on the trigger of his revolver, and was about to demand it to stop and give the reason for its presence there, when the figure halted of its own accord before the door behind which he stood, and holding the lighted lamp she carried to her features, grinned in a malicious and diabolical manner at him. This act so infuriated my father, who was anything but lamb-like in disposition, that he sprang into the corridor with a bound, and discharged the revolver right in her face. The figure instantly disappeared - the figure at which for several minutes ''three'' men had been looking together – and the bullet passed through the outer door of the room on the opposite side of the corridor, and lodged in the panel of the inner one. My father never attempted again to interfere with "The Brown Lady of Raynham".&lt;ref&gt;Marryat, Florence. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c7ZbA6W5w-AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=florence+Marryat+there+is+no+death&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=tIfrTOKsDoiAhAfj6smsAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false There Is No Death]'' First published in 1917 by David McKay.

Lady Townshend reported that the "Brown Lady" was next seen in 1926, when her son and his friend claimed to have seen the ghost on the staircase, identifying the ghostly figure with the portrait of Lady Dorothy Walpole which then hung in the haunted room.

[[Image:Raynham Hall.jpg|thumb|Raynham Hall]]
On September 19, 1936 Captain Hubert C. Provand, a London-based photographer working for ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine, and his assistant, Indre Shira, were taking photographs of Raynham Hall for an article. They claim that they had already taken a photograph of the Hall's main staircase and were setting up to take a second when Shira saw "a vapoury form gradually assuming the appearance of a woman" moving down the stairs towards them.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; Under Shira's direction Provand quickly took the cap off the lens while Shira pressed the trigger to activate the camera's flash. Later, when the negative was developed, the famous image of the "Brown Lady" was revealed. The account of Provand and Shira's ghostly experience at Raynham Hall was published in ''Country Life'' magazine on December 26, 1936 along with the photograph of the Brown Lady.&lt;ref name=Mysterious/&gt;&lt;ref name=Life&gt;''Country Life'' magazine 26 December 1936&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph and the account of its taking also appeared in the January 4, 1937 edition of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=Myst&gt;[http://www.unexplained-mysteries.com/column.php?id=183215 'The Camera Never Lies?'] Forde, Matt on Unexplained Mysteries website&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Shortly thereafter, the noted [[paranormal]] investigator [[Harry Price]] interviewed Provand and Shira and reported, "I will say at once I was impressed. I was told a perfectly simple story: Mr. Indre Shira saw the apparition descending the stairs at the precise moment when Captain Provand’s head was under the black cloth. A shout – and the cap was off and the flashbulb fired, with the results which we now see. I could not shake their story, and I had no right to disbelieve them. Only collusion between the two men would account for the ghost if it is a fake. The negative is entirely innocent of any faking."&lt;ref name=Myst/&gt;

==Skeptical reception==

Some critics have claimed that Shira faked the image by putting grease or a similar substance on the lens in the shape of a figure, or moved down the stairs himself during an exposure. Others claim that the image is an accidental [[Multiple exposure|double exposure]] or that light somehow got into the camera.&lt;ref name=Mysterious/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/technology/article1967261.ece "Ultimate proof that ghosts exist, or maybe it's just dust on the lens"]. Wade, Mike. ''[[The Times]]''. March 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe Nickell]] has written that a detailed examination of the photograph shows evidence of double exposure.&lt;ref&gt;
Nickell, Joe. (2008). [http://www.csicop.org/si/show/photoghosts_images_of_the_spirit_realm "Photoghosts: Images of the Spirit Realm?"]. Csicop.org. Retrieved 2014-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; John Fairley and Simon Welfare wrote "there is a pale line above each [[Stair tread|stair-tread]], indicating that one picture has been superimposed over the other; a patch of reflected light at the top of the right-hand banister appears twice."&lt;ref&gt;Fairley, John; Welfare, Simeon. (1987). ''Arthur C. Clarke’s Chronicles of the Strange and Mysterious''. Collins. p. 140. {{ISBN|0-00-217618-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magician [[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]] wrote the photograph could easily be duplicated by naturalistic methods. Booth had the magician Ron Wilson cover himself in a bed sheet and descend the grand staircase at [[The Magic Castle]] in Hollywood. The faked ghost image looked very similar to the Raynham Hall photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, John. (1986). ''Psychic Paradoxes''. Prometheus Books. pp. 108-109. {{ISBN|0-87975-358-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics point out that the image of the lady very closely resembles that of a standard Virgin Mary statue as would be found in any Catholic church, the light patch covering the bottom one third of the image, resembling an inverted "V" shape, being very indicative, as the outer garment above it drapes down on either side at an angle. Also the head is covered and the hands appear to be together as in prayer, and the square or rectangular pedestal on which she stands is also clearly visible. This strongly suggests that the photo is a simple superimposition of the Madonna statue onto the empty staircase.&lt;ref&gt;"Ghost Haunts" (2008) http://www.ghosthaunts.com/raynham_brown_lady.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Burebista''''' (1980) is a Romanian historical epic film about the life of the ancient [[Dacia]]n king [[Burebista]], depicting his battle to unify his nation and to resist Roman incursions. 

The film was made to commemorate the supposed 2,050th anniversary of the founding of the "unified and centralized" country that was to become Romania. The government of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] claimed an uninterrupted existence of the state from Burebista to Ceaușescu himself.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, L., ''History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness'', Central European University Press, Budapest, 2001, p. 78; 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:TheSphinx.jpg|thumb|left|The head-shaped rock (known as the [[Sphinx (Romania)|Bucegi Sphinx]]) with which the film begins and ends]]
The film begins with a shot of [[Sphinx (Romania)|a rocky outcrop]], shaped like a human head, apparently gazing out over the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. A voice-over explains that the expansion of Roman power is beginning to threaten the borders of the kingdom of Dacia under its "enigmatic" ruler Burebista.

The high priest [[Deceneus]] convinces the Dacian lords to swear allegiance to Burebista as king of a unified Dacia. He promises to keep Dacia free from the increasing power of Rome. A rigorous regime of military training is introduced by the king. Some refugees from Rome arrive, including Calopor, a former gladiator who had served with Spartacus. Burebista welcomes them, asking Calopor to tell him about Spartacus' exploits.  Burebista also learns about the ambition of the young Julius Caesar, and his rivalry with Pompey. 

Messengers from [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] and from Greece arrive to ask Burebista's help in resisting the advance of Roman forces.  Burebista agrees to help. Calopor is sent to assess the situation in Greece. While there he meets his former girlfriend Lydia, who has been forced to marry the arrogant Roman aristocrat [[Gaius Antonius Hybrida]]. Hybrida demands games in his honour. Calopor takes part as a gladiator, planning to kill Hybrida. When Calopor throws a trident at him, Hybrida pulls Lydia in front of his body, and the trident kills her. Horrified, Calopor leaps up and stabs Hybrida to death, giving the signal for a general uprising. With the Romans in confusion, Burebista launches his cavalry against their retreating forces, defeating them.

Burebista celebrates his victory with a festival in Dacia. He learns from a messenger that Mithridates has killed himself to avoid being captured by Pompey, but is given a letter in which the dead king encourages him to continue to resist Rome. Another letter also arrives, from Pompey. Pompey is now asking Burebista's help to curb Caesar. He ponders trouble to come.

The [[Boii]], a Celtic tribe, raids Dacia, capturing and enslaving villagers with the help of a Dacian traitor. Burebista discovers that the raid succeeded because guards were drunk. He orders the destruction of grapevines. He attempts to negotiate with the Celts, telling them that Dacians and Celts need to cooperate to preserve independence from Rome. The Celts, influenced by their fanatical Druid Breza, refuse to negotiate. Forced to fight, Burebista is worried that the war will weaken both sides, giving Caesar an opportunity to invade. The Celts, meanwhile, threaten to kill all their Dacian captives. Deceneus tells Burebista that there will soon be a solar eclipse. Burebista decides to use this to frighten the Celts with the power of the Dacian gods. He tells them that the gods will darken the sun. The eclipse terrifies the Celts, who agree to surrender the captives. Breza flees, pursued by Calopor. When Calopor follows him into a building, Breza stabs him in the back. As he dies, Calopor reveals that he is Burebista's illegitimate son. Breza is captured and executed by being thrown into an altar pyre of the goddess [[Epona]]. 

With Celtic tribes now acknowledging his rule, Burebista has created a strong kingdom. In Gaul, Caesar announces that he has conquered the country and absorbed it into the Roman empire. After he has defeated Pompey, he will proceed to absorb Dacia too. As, some time later,  Burebista ponders Caesar's vow, he is told that the threat is over — Caesar has been assassinated. Deceneus speaks of the transience of life. Burebista says that all kings must die, but the unity of the nation he has created should be immortal. He gazes over the mountains, and his head fades into a merge with the rock with which the film began.

==Significance==
[[File:Stamp burebista.jpg|thumb|1980 Stamp, labeled "2050 years from the creation of the first Dacian state, centralized and independent under the rule of Burebista"]]
The film was made to coincide with celebrations of the founding of a unified state, presented as the model for modern Romania. According to [[Lucian Boia]], Burebista was constantly compared to Ceaușescu, {{quote|even a professional historian like Ion Horaţiu Crişan did not hesitate to write words of homage addressed to the Dacian king in the manner of those addressed to the communist dictator. Thus Burebista was “animated by the burning desire to raise up his folk. To them he dedicated his entire activity, in internal and external affairs, his entire life."&lt;ref&gt;Lucian Boia, ''History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness'', Central European University Press, Budapest, 2001, p.221&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Doru Pop argues that Ceaușescu's "national-communist ideology" needed the support of claims that he "descended from a long line of Romanian (!) historical figures, beginning with Burebista, the illusory ruler of the Dacian empire."&lt;ref&gt;Pop, Doru, ''Romanian New Wave Cinema: An Introduction'', McFarland, 3 Mar 2014, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daphne Blake''' is a fictional character in the long-running American [[animated series]] ''[[Scooby-Doo]]''. Daphne, depicted as coming from a wealthy family, is noted for her [[red hair]], lavender heels, [[fashion sense]], and her knack for getting into danger, hence the nickname "Danger Prone Daphne". Daphne has appeared in more adaptations than the other characters, aside from [[Shaggy Rogers]] and [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]].

The Daphne character was inspired by the sophisticated and money-hungry teen character [[Thalia Menninger]], as played by [[Tuesday Weld]], from the late 50s/early 60s American sitcom ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Evanier|Evanier, Mark]]. (July 10, 2002).[http://povonline.com/2002/News060902.htm Post] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514004226/http://www.povonline.com/2002/News060902.htm |date=May 14, 2006 }} on "News from Me" blog for ''Povonline.com''. Retrieved March 27, 2006. Excerpt: "Fred was based on Dobie, Velma on Zelda, Daphne on Thalia and Shaggy on [[Maynard G. Krebs|Maynard]]."&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!]]'' shows her birthday to be December 25 to create a personal conflict for her regarding Christmas overshadowing her birthday.

Together with her other teenage companions, [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]], [[Velma Dinkley]], [[Shaggy Rogers]], and Shaggy's Great Dane, Scooby-Doo, Daphne would engage in solving various mysteries. In the first series, Daphne was portrayed as the beautiful and enthusiastic but clumsy and danger-prone member of the gang (hence her nickname, "Danger-prone Daphne") who always follows her intuition. She serves as the [[damsel in distress]] and would occasionally get kidnapped, tied up, gagged, and then left imprisoned. But as the franchise went on, she became a stronger, more independent character, who could take care of herself.

During the series' fourth incarnation, ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'', some of the episodes focused on Daphne. In the episode, "Shiver and Shake, That Demon's a Snake", Daphne buys an idol which is cursed by the snake demon. On the sailboat, the snake demon attacks Daphne and demands an idol to return. In the episode, "The Scary Sky Skeleton", Daphne is reunited with her old friend, Wendy.

In the episode, "I Left My Neck in San Francisco", Daphne becomes sick and she's unable to help the gang to solve the mystery about The Lady Vampire of the Bay. Due to the vampire's look, Daphne's unseen reflection in the mirror, the bat flying around Daphne's bed and herself returning to bed a little later, Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy are convinced that Daphne is a vampire. When the vampiress is revealed to be Lefty Callahan, Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy realize they made a mistake with suspecting Daphne and she is feeling well again.

When the original Mystery Inc. group took a hiatus from the franchise in the 80s, Daphne was initially absent too, with the series focusing on the comedy antics of Scooby, Shaggy, and Scrappy. However, when the "Whodunnit?" aspect returned to the series with ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries]]'', Daphne returned, now an accomplished investigator assisted by Shaggy and the two dogs, investigating supernatural occurrences. She continued to help Scooby battle evil forces of the supernatural in the ''[[13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'' series.

The youthful Daphne portrayed in ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'' would commonly call upon her [[butler]], Jenkins, to do various tasks. The younger Daphne is shown (along with her parents) to not believe in ghost/monsters/supernatural (one of her catchphrases in that series was "''There is no such thing as ghosts (monsters)!''), a trait she lacks outside the ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'' series.

In the movie ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]]'', Daphne as an adult, had a very successful investigative TV series called ''Coast to Coast with Daphne Blake'' on a [[fiction]]al [[television channel|channel]] called "Americana", which the show had aired on for two seasons. The producer of the show was Fred Jones.

Throughout the various incarnations of the character, there has been speculation that Daphne and Fred had an attraction toward each other. This is emphasized in many of the direct-to-video movies and the TV series ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]''. By the time of the second season, they are shown to be actively dating, showing more of his feelings toward Daphne. In the first live-action ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' movie, the two initially are just friends with but as the film progresses they begin to develop a romantic interest in each other and briefly kiss after saving Spooky Island. In the sequel ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'', they are in a relationship.

In ''[[Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!]]'', Daphne is portrayed as being an eccentric nonconformist, usually having a different odd obsession each episode (such as puppets, false facial hair, etc.)

==Appearance==
Her usual appearance in the franchise consists of a purple mini dress, pink [[pantyhose]], purple shoes, and a green scarf. In ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]],'' ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost]],'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase]]'', she wore a purple and green three-piece suit with matching shoes. In ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders]]'', she wore a purple sleeveless shirt with pink shorts and purple trainers boots or shoes.

As a child, she wore a pink sweater, red skirt, and pink pantyhose with white [[go-go boot]]s. In ''[[The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'', she wore other purple and pink clothes. Some included a purple jumpsuit and a purple dress with a white belt. In ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'', she wears various outfits, but mostly a purple/pink dress with pink [[Fashion boot|knee high boots]].

==Relatives==
Relatives of Daphne, including her four identical sisters, shown during the series' run include:
*'''George Robert Nedley Blake and Elizabeth Blake''': Daphne's parents. In ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' they are named Barty Blake and Nan Blake. Voiced by [[Frank Welker]] and [[Kath Soucie]].
*'''Daisy''': Daphne's sister, a doctor. Voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]].
*'''Dawn''': Daphne's sister, a model.
*'''Dorothy''': Daphne's sister, a race car driver.
*'''Delilah''': Daphne's sister, in the Marine Corps. Voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]].
*'''Uncle Matt Blake''': Daphne's uncle, a cattle [[rancher]].
*'''John "J.J." Maxwell''': Daphne's uncle, a movie director.
*'''Olivia Dervy''': Daphne's aunt.
*'''Jennifer''': Daphne's cousin.
*'''Danica LaBlake''': Daphne's cousin, a famous [[France|French]] model. Voiced by [[Vanessa Marshall]].
*'''Shannon Blake''': Daphne's [[Scotland|Scottish]] cousin. Voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]].
*'''Anne Blake''': Daphne's younger cousin in [[Scooby-Doo (video game)|the Scooby-Doo video game]].
*'''Thornton Blake V''': Daphne's uncle, owner of a Golf Course near [[Lake Erie]].

'''Note''': Frank Welker, Kath Soucie, and Jennifer Hale voice the Blakes in ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' series, Vanessa Marshall voiced Danica in the ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]'' series and Grey DeLisle voiced Shannon in the film ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster]]'' (direct-to-DVD). Welker also voiced George on ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]''. The late voice actor [[Don Messick]] voiced two of Daphne's uncles: Matthew "Matt" Blake on ''[[The Scooby-Doo Show]]'' and John Maxwell on ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]''.

==In other media==
Daphne was portrayed by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] in the film ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'' and voiced in the animated series ''[[Robot Chicken]]''. Her husband [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] played Fred in the same films.

In these movies, Daphne and Fred began a relationship in the first that followed on through the second. Unlike the previous incarnation of the character, Gellar's version of Daphne is trained in martial arts during Mystery Inc.'s 2-year-long departure in the first film, as she is tired of being a damsel in distress on every case that she is involved in with the gang. Coincidentally, this subversion of the damsel in distress to a strong female fighter almost mirrors Gellar's widely recognized role of the [[Buffy Summers|title character]] in the TV series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. Though in the first movie, she is captured by the masked wrestler Zarkos, she beats him in a fight at the end.

Daphne is portrayed by [[Kate Melton]] in the third film ''[[Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins]]'' (released as a TV movie in 2009) and its sequel ''[[Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster]]'' (which premiered on October 16, 2010). These two movies are prequels to the first two live-action movies and show how the gang met while in High School. Daphne is the president of the drama club at Coolsville High School and the lead in the school musical. It is also revealed that she is the actual owner of the [[Mystery Machine]].

[[Sarah Jeffery]] will portray Daphne in the live-action film [[Daphne &amp; Velma]]. This film will show a different origin to how Daphne met the rest of Mystery Inc. According to this movie Daphne met Velma first and the two of them started solving mysteries before meeting the other members of the gang.

==Reception==
Members of the fanbase of the original ''Scooby-Doo'' speculated that Daphne and [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]] had a romantic attraction to one another.&lt;ref name="Brizz"&gt;Breznican, Anthony.

'''''De nostri temporis studiorum ratione''''' is an [[oration]] by [[Gianbattista Vico]] first published in 1708.  The work's title is usually rendered in English as "On the Study Method of Our Times." Alternatively, scholars refer to the work as the ''De Ratione''. Given the fact that it refers back to the Jesuit [[ratio studiorum]], Vico's title may be most literally rendered as "The Method of the Studies of our Times." 

In his ''De Ratione'', Vico sets out to compare classical/ancient learning (viz. the political-philosophical thought of pre-Christian Greece and Rome) and modernists (esp. modern jurisprudence, or modern readings of jus/right), drawing the reader's attention to what the two can learn from each other.

'''Design methods''' are procedures, techniques, aids, or tools for designing. They offer a number of different kinds of activities that the designer might use within an overall design process. Conventional procedures of design, such as drawing, can be regarded as design methods, but since the 1950s new procedures have been developed that are more usually grouped together under the name of 'Design Methods’. What these new methods have in common is that they "are attempts to make public the hitherto private thinking of designers; to externalise the design process".&lt;ref name="Jones Design Methods"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=J. Christopher |title=Design Methods |date=1980 |publisher=Wiley |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Design methodology'' is the broader study of method in design: the study of the principles, practices and procedures of designing.&lt;ref name="Cross Methodology"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cross |first1=Nigel |title=Developments in Design Methodology |date=1984 |publisher=Wiley |location=UK |isbn=0471102482}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Background==
Social, political and economic developments of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century put into motion modern benefits and constraints for living and working. Industrial and technological breakthroughs associated with this period created social and economic complexities for people and their environment. Disciplines such as architecture, urban planning, engineering and product development began to tackle new types of problem-solving past traditional artifact making. More informed and methodical approaches to designing were required.

From 1958 to 1963 [[Horst Rittel]] was a pioneer in articulating the relationship between science and design, specifically the limitations of design processes based on the 19th century rational view of science, in his courses at [[Ulm School of Design]] in Germany (Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm: 1953–1968).&lt;ref name=Ulm1&gt;[http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/the_hfg_ulm/ ''Ulm School of Design | HfG Ulm Archive'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ulm2&gt;Lindinger, H., (1991), ''Ulm Design: The Morality of Objects'', Cambridge: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Rittel proposed principles for dealing with these limitations through his seminal HfG design methods courses: [[cybernetics]], [[operational analysis]] and [[communication theory]].&lt;ref name=Ulm1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ulm2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rit1&gt;Rith, C and Dubberly, H, 'Why Horst W J Rittel Matters', Design Issues, Vol 23, No 1, pp. 72-91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 he was recruited to Berkeley to teach design methods courses and helped found the Design Methods Group (DMG) and the DMG Journal.&lt;ref name=Rit1 /&gt;

Design methods in England originally drew from a 1962 conference&lt;ref&gt;John Christopher Jones and Denis Thornley (eds). The Conference on Design Methods: papers presented at the conference on systematic and intuitive methods in engineering, industrial design, architecture and communications, London, September 1962, Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; called "The Conference on Systematic and Intuitive Methods in Engineering, Industrial Design, Architecture and [[Communication studies|Communications]]." This event was organized by [[John Christopher Jones|John Chris Jones]], and Peter Slann who, with conference invitees, were driven by concerns about how their modern industrialized world was being manifested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/dmconference1962.html 1962 conference participants]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conference participants countered the craftsman model of design which was rooted in turning raw materials through tried and true craft-based knowledge into finished products. They believed that a single craft-based designer producing design solutions was not compatible with addressing the evolving complexity of post-industrial societies. They stressed that designers needed to work in cross-disciplinary teams where each participant brings his/her specific body of skills, language and experiences to defining and solving problems in whatever context.

The &lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/theory_of_designing.html John Chris Jones lists key design questions]&lt;/ref&gt; key benefit was to find a method that suits a particular design situation. [[Christopher Alexander]] went on to write his seminal books ''[[A Pattern Language]]'' and ''[[A Timeless Way of Building]]''.

=== Emergence of design research and design studies ===
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, graduates of the [[Ulm School of Design]] in Germany (Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm: 1953–1968).&lt;ref name="Ulm1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ulm2"/&gt; began to spread Horst Rittel's approach of design methodology across Europe and the United States in context of their professional work and teaching what became known as the 'Ulm Model'.&lt;ref name=Ulm2 /&gt;

Likewise, after the 1962 conference in England, many of the participants began to publish and to define an area of research that focused on design. Three "camps" seemed to emerge to develop different directions in the initial work in Design Methods:

:* Behaviorism interpreted Design Methods as a way to describe [[human behavior]] in relation to the built environment. Its clinical approach tended to rely on human behavior processes ([[Categorization|taxonomic]] activities).
:* Reductivism broke Design Methods down into small constituent parts. This scientific approach tended to rely on rationalism and objectified processes such as [[epistemological]] activities.
:* Phenomenology approached design methods from an experiential approach (human experience and [[perception]].)

The [[Design Research Society]] was founded in 1966 by several participants from the Conference on Design Methods. The purpose of the Society is  to promote "the study of and research into the process of designing in all its many fields" and is an interdisciplinary group with many professions represented, but all bound by the conviction of the benefits of [[design research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/early_days1.0.html John Chris Jones thoughts on design research]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Environmental Design Research Association]] is one of the best-known entities that strive to integrate designers and [[social science]] professionals for better built environments. EDRA was founded by Henry Sanoff in 1969. Both [[John Chris Jones]] and [[Christopher Alexander]] interacted with EDRA and other camps; both seemed at a certain point to reject their interpretations. Jones and Alexander also questioned their original theses about design methods.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

An interesting shift that affected design methods and design studies was a series of 1968 lectures by [[Herbert A. Simon]], the Nobel laureate, on "The Sciences of the Artificial".&lt;ref&gt;Simon, H. A. (1969) ''The Sciences of the Artificial'', MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed using [[scientific methods]] to explore the world of man-made things (hence artificial). He discussed the role of [[wiktionary:analysis|analysis]] ([[observation]]) and [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] (making) as a process of creating man-made responses to the world he/she interacted with. Important to Simon's contribution were his notions of "[[bounded rationality]]" and "[[satisficing]]." Simon's concept had a profound impact on the discourse in both design methods, and the newly emerging design studies communities in two ways. It provided an entry to using scientific ideas to overlay on design, and it also created an internal debate whether design could/should be expressed and practiced as a type of [[science]] with the reduction of emphasis on [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].

[[Nigel Cross]] has been prolific in articulating the issues of design methods and design research. The discussion of the ongoing debate of what is design research and design science was, and continues to be articulated by Cross. His thesis is that design is not a science, but is an area that is searching for "intellectual independence." He views the original design methods discussions of the 1960s as a way to integrate objective and rational methods in practicing design. Scientific method was borrowed as one framework, and the term [[design science]] was coined in 1966 at the conference on The Design Method focusing on a systematic approach to practicing design.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, S. A (1966), Design Science. In S. A Gregory (ed.) The Design Method. London, Butterworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Cross defined the "science of design" as a way to create a body of work to improve the understanding of design methods&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. (1993) 'A History of Design Methodology', in M. de Vries, N. Cross and D. Grant (eds.), ''Design Methodology and Relationships with Science'', Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht.&lt;/ref&gt; — and more importantly that design does not need to be a binary choice between [[science]] and [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. (1982) 'Designerly Ways of Knowing', ''Design Studies'', '''3''', 221-227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigan Bayazit published an overview of the historical development of design methods. She stated that "Design methods people were looking at rational methods of incorporating scientific techniques and knowledge into the design process to make rational decisions to adapt to the prevailing values, something that was not always easy to achieve."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/074793604772933739 Bayazit, Nigan. "Investigating Design: A Review of Forty Years of Design Research."] Design Issues: Vol 20, No 1. Winter 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional design practice===
Conversations about design methods and a more systematic approach to design was not isolated to Europe. America was also a magnet for practicing design professionals to codify their successes in design practice and backing into larger theories about the dynamics of design methods.

American designers were much more pragmatic at articulating design methods and creating an underlying language about the practice of industrial and graphic design. They were tied to economic systems that supported design practice and therefore focused on the way design could be managed as an extension of business, rather than the European approach to design methods based on transforming engineering by design.

Industrial design was the first area that made inroads into systematizing [[knowledge]] through practice. [[Raymond Loewy]] was instrumental at elevating the visibility of industrial design through cult of personality (appearing three times on front cover of ''Time Magazine''). [[Henry Dreyfuss]] had a profound impact on the practice of industrial design by developing a systematic process used to shape environments, [[transportation]], [[Product (business)|products]] and [[packaging]]. His focus on the needs of the average consumer was most celebrated in his book ''Designing for People'', an extensive exploration of [[ergonomics]].

[[Jay Doblin]] one of America's foremost industrial designers, worked for Raymond Loewy and was later an employee of [[Unimark International]], the world’s largest global design firm during the 1960s with offices in seven countries. In 1972, Doblin formed Chicago-based Jay Doblin &amp; Associates, a firm which managed innovative programs for Xerox Corporation and General Electric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm?contentalias=JayDoblin AIGA Overview of Jay Doblin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103135028/http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm?contentalias=JayDoblin |date=2005-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doblin was prolific at developing a language to describe design. One of his best articles was "A Short, Grandiose Theory of Design", published in the 1987 Society of Typographic Arts Design Journal. In seven pages, Doblin presents a straightforward and persuasive argument for design as a systematic process. He described the emerging landscape of systematic design:

:* For large complex projects, it "would be irresponsible to attempt them without analytical methods" and rallied against an "adolescent reliance on overly intuitive practices."
:* He separated "direct design" in which a craftsperson works on the artifact to "indirect design" in which a design first creates a representation of the artifact, separating design from production in more complex situations.

Doblin and others were responding to the increased [[Inheritance (computer science)|specialization]] of design and the complexity of managing large design programs for corporations. It was a natural process to begin to discuss how design should move upstream to be involved with the specifications of problems, not only in the traditional mode of production which design had been practiced. Particularly since 2000, design methods and its intersection with business development have been visibly championed by numerous consultancies within design industry.

The continuity of approaches to design projects by such representative firms is the generation of inputs incited by the human condition in varied contexts. These approaches utilize a sustainable methods-based mode of making that takes into account critical analytic and [[Synthetic proposition|synthetic]] skills toward more informed and inspired specifications grounded in:

:* Direct investigation of human circumstances to draw out impressions
:* Engagement by client-side and end-user participants in design process
:* Open articulation by practitioners of multiple disciplines facilitated by design

====Significance of role of professional design practice====
Practitioners approached design methods from a different angle than John Christopher Jones and the group of engineers and designers who convened in 1962. Many practitioners, through actual design opportunities, began to confront the complexities of the market and clients. They began to address issues of specifications, [[wiktionary:user|users]], distribution and [[innovation]]. Since there were no established methods, each practitioner began to develop frameworks and languages to describe a new way to design. Like any market-based model, there were many competing ideas about these new methods and their basis. Many of these designers may have been aware of the design methods movement, but many were not. Yet all their ideas were aligned to many of the basic tenets of the 1962 conference which advocated a more rigorous way of doing design. However, the social perspectives and criticisms of mediocre products of 1962 participants may not have been shared or agreed with.

==Current state of design methods==
There is no one way to practice design methods. John Chris Jones recognized this by stating:

:"Methodology should not be a fixed track to a fixed destination, but a conversation about everything that could be made to happen. The language of the conversation must bridge the logical gap between past and future, but in doing so it should not limit the variety of possible futures that are discussed nor should it force the choice  of a future that is unfree."&lt;ref name="Jones Design Methods"/&gt;

The focus of most post-1962 enhancements to design methods has been on developing a series of relevant, sound, humanistic problem-solving procedures and techniques to reduce avoidable errors and oversights that can adversely affect design solutions. The key benefit is to find a method that suits a particular design situation.

The benefits of their original work has been abstracted many times over; but in today's design environment, several of their main ideas have been integrated into contemporary design methods:
:* Emphasis on the user
:* Use of basic research methods to validate convictions with fact
:* Use of [[brainstorming]] and other related means to break mental patterns and precedent
:* Increased [[collaboration|collaborative]] nature of design with other disciplines

A large challenge for design as a discipline, its use of methods and an endeavor to create shared values, is its inherent synthetic nature as an area of study and action. This allows design to be extremely malleable in nature, borrowing ideas and concepts from a wide variety of professions to  suit the ends of individual practitioners. It also makes design vulnerable since these very activities make design a discipline unextensible as a shared body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/designmethodsforeveryone.html John Chris Jones perspective about "Design Methods for Everyone"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[Donald Schon]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], published ''The Reflective Practitioner''.&lt;ref&gt;Schon, Donald A. The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think in Action.  1983. Basic Books. {{ISBN|0-465-06878-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw traditional professions with stable knowledge bases, such as [[law]] and [[medicine]], becoming unstable due to outdated notions of 'technical-rationality' as the grounding of professional knowledge. Practitioners were able to describe how they 'think on their feet', and how they make use of a standard set of frameworks and techniques. Schon foresaw the increasing instability of traditional knowledge and how to achieve it. This is in line with the original founders of design methods who wanted to break with an unimaginative and static technical society and unify [[exploration]], [[collaboration]] and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].

Design methods has influenced design practice and [[design education]]. It has benefited the design community by helping to create introductions that would never have happened if traditional professions remained ''stable'', which did not necessarily allow collaboration due to gate keeping of areas of knowledge and [[expertise]]. Design has been by nature an interloper activity, with individuals that have crossed disciplines to question and innovate.

The challenge is to transform individual [[experiences]], frameworks and [[perspective (cognitive)|perspectives]] into a shared, understandable, and, most importantly, a transmittable area of knowledge. Victor Margolin {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} states three reasons why this will prove difficult:

:* Domain knowledge is a mixture of [[vocation]] (discipline) and avocation (interest) creating hybrid definitions that degrade shared knowledge
:* [[Intellectual capital]] of design and wider scholarly pluralism has diluted focus and shared language which has led to ungovernable [[laissez-faire]] values
:* Individual explorations of design discourse focuses too much on individual narratives leading to personal point of view rather than a critical mass of shared values

In the end, ''design methods'' is a term that is widely used. Though conducive to interpretations, it is a shared belief in an exploratory and rigorous method to solve problems through design, an act which is part and parcel of what designers aim to accomplish in today's complex world.

'''''Detroit''''' is a 2017 American [[Period film|period]] [[crime film|crime drama]] film directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]] and written by [[Mark Boal]].

== Plot ==
On July 23, 1967, the [[Detroit Police Department]] staged a raid on an [[Blind pig|unlicensed club]] during a celebration for returning black veterans from the [[Vietnam War]]. While suspects are being arrested, a mob forms and starts throwing rocks at the officers before looting nearby stores and starting fires, beginning the [[12th Street Riot]]. With state authorities, elected representatives, and even emergency services unable to maintain any semblance of order, Governor [[George W. Romney]] authorizes the [[Michigan Army National Guard]] and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] authorizes [[paratroopers#United States|Army paratroopers]] to enter Detroit in order to provide assistance. On the second day of rioting, two cops pursue a fleeing looter. One of them, Philip Krauss, kills the man with a shotgun against orders, but is allowed to remain on duty until his superiors can decide whether to file murder charges.

[[The Dramatics]], a professional black [[R&amp;B]] group, arrive in Detroit hoping to score a recording contract. Seconds before their scheduled performance at a music hall, the police shut down the venue and order them to leave the city. En route, their bus is attacked by rioters and the group subsequently splits up, with lead singer Larry Reed and his friend Fred Temple renting a room at the local Algiers Motel for the night. They meet two white girls, Julie Ann and Karen, who introduce them to their friends Carl Cooper and Aubrey Pollard. Carl and another friend stage a prank using a [[Starting pistol|starter pistol]], upsetting Julie and Karen, who move to the room of Greene, a Vietnam War veteran, while Larry and Fred return to their own room.

Melvin Dismukes, a private [[security guard]], is assigned to protect a grocery store from looters and ingratiates himself with the Guardsmen. Carl decides to fire several blanks from his pistol in the direction of the troops to frighten them, but they mistake it for a [[sniper]] attack and pinpoint it coming from the Algiers due to the pistol's [[muzzle flash]]. The [[Michigan State Police]], National Guard, and Detroit Police arrive at the motel to investigate, led by Detroit police officer Krauss. Entering the building, they gun down Carl when he tries to escape, and Krauss plants a knife next to his body as he bleeds out and dies.

They round up everyone in the hotel and line them against the wall, demanding to know who the sniper was. Despite not finding any weapon during a search of the room, Krauss terrorizes and interrogates the occupants of the hotel. Dismukes arrives to try to help. Unwilling to get involved, most of the state police and National Guard leave without informing anyone of Krauss's abuse.

Krauss orders several suspects to be moved to different rooms and subjected to [[mock execution]]s in order to terrify the others into confessing. One police officer actually kills Aubrey, as he didn't understand the executions were supposed to be faked. Julie and Karen are taken to an upstairs room when they begin screaming, and Julie's clothes are torn off. Disgusted, a Guardsman returns, and manages to get them released from custody. Fearing arrest, Krauss permits the remaining suspects to leave, but only if they swear to keep silent. Greene and Larry agree, but Fred is killed when he refuses.

As the riots die down, Dismukes, while working his other job in a factory, is arrested and charged with murder after Julie identifies him as being present at the Algiers that night. Krauss and his fellow officers are questioned as well, and when everyone except Krauss confesses, they are also charged. Larry, whose singing career has stalled due to the trauma he experienced, is summoned as a witness to testify. The judge ultimately refuses to accept any of the confessions as evidence, and without a solid case, the all-white jury acquits Dismukes, Krauss, and their co-defendants of all charges. Dismukes confronts Krauss with the truth, but finds himself powerless to get any justice for the victims.

The film ends by explaining what became of the participants: Dismukes moved to the suburbs to escape death threats and resumed work as a security guard, Krauss and his men never returned to active duty, Julie rebuilt her life and started a family, and Larry became a choir singer and still lives in Detroit to the present day.

===Critical response===
''Detroit'' received praise for its direction, screenplay, and acting, especially Boyega, Poulter, and Smith's performances.&lt;ref name=reviews/&gt;&lt;ref name=reviews2/&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 260 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Detroit'' delivers a gut-wrenching – and essential – dramatisation of a tragic chapter from America's past that draws distressing parallels to the present."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/detroit_2017 |title=Detroit (2017) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/detroit |title=Detroit Reviews |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it an 86% overall positive score and a 63% "definite recommend".&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

[[Richard Roeper]] of ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 4 out of 4 stars and called it one of 2017's best, saying: "Journalist-screenwriter Mark Boal (Bigelow's collaborator on ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'' and ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'') does a magnificent job of juggling the multiple storylines and creating fully authentic characters—some flawed, some basically decent, some evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/roeper-tight-focus-intensifies-the-drama-of-riot-recap-detroit/ |title=Tight focus intensifies the drama of riot recap 'Detroit'|website=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |date=July 25, 2016|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] praised the cast and script, giving the film 3.5/4 stars and saying, "... ''Detroit'' is far more than a liberal howl against the escalating toxicity of racism in America. Bigelow, with the same immersive intensity that [[Christopher Nolan]] brings to ''[[Dunkirk (2017 film)|Dunkirk]]'', smacks us down in the middle of a brutal historical event so we can see it – and feel it – for ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/peter-travers-detroit-will-leave-you-moved-scarred-w493733|title='Detroit' Review: Kathryn Bigelow's Recreation of Riots, Racism Is Cry of Rage |last=Travers |first=Peter |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=July 25, 2017 |accessdate=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Alexander Nazaryan of ''[[Newsweek]]'' said, "[Bigelow's] characters never come alive, moving through the film less as people than entries in a sociology textbook ... If Bigelow could get inside the minds of soldiers suffocated by post-traumatic stress disorder, as she did so capably in ''The Hurt Locker'', she can get into the mind of anyone. In ''Zero Dark Thirty'', she made even CIA interrogators likeable. The characters in ''Detroit'', though, black and white, are as flat as the plains of the Upper Midwest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2017/07/28/kathryn-bigelow-detroit-race-riots-movie-review-642376.html |title=Kathryn Bigelow's 'Detroit' Is A Well-intentioned Misfire|website=[[Newsweek]] |date=July 26, 2016|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several critics noted the film's questionable take on a predominantly African American-based story. [[A. O. Scott]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "It is curious that a movie set against a backdrop of black resistance and rebellion—however inchoate and self-destructive its expression may have been—should become a tale of black helplessness and passivity. The white men, the decent ones as much as the brutes, have the answers, the power, the agency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Scott|first1=A.O. |title=In Detroit, Black Lives Caught in the Pre-History of the Alt-Right |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/movies/detroit-review.html|work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; K. Austin Collins of ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]'' wrote, "This movie isn't really about black people as people, nor history as a lived experience, but is instead invested in a dutiful, 'just the facts, ma'am' reenactment that pretends those other things are already a given. Boal, and Bigelow beside him, refuse to speculate about — or imagine — the rest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Collins |first1=K. Austin |date=July 28, 2017 |title='Detroit' Gives Us the Who, What, and Where, but Not the Why |url=https://theringer.com/detroit-film-review-kathryn-bigelow-john-boyega-4b4fbe64d509 |publisher=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]] |access-date=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s Richard Brody called the film "a moral failure", saying: "[Bigelow's] intentions come through clearly: to depict an incident—and a climate—of racism, to show that the cruelty of these deeds was multiplied by their ultimate impunity, and to suggest that, in the intervening half-century since the events depicted in the film took place, little has changed. Movies aren’t made with intentions, though; they’re made with people and with equipment, and what Bigelow has her actors do for the benefit of the camera is repellent to imagine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brody |first1=Richard |date=August 27, 2017 |title=The Immoral Artistry of Kathryn Bigelow's 'Detroit' |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-immoral-artistry-of-kathryn-bigelows-detroit |publisher=[[The New Yorker (website)|The New Yorker]] |access-date=August 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accuracy==
According to Melvin Dismukes, who is depicted prominently in the film, ''Detroit'' "is 99.5% accurate as to what went down at the Algiers and in the city at the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/detroit-melvin-dismukes-interview-1202511170/|title=‘Detroit’ Subject Melvin Dismukes on What Kathryn Bigelow Film Gets Right|first=Brent|last=Lang|date=August 1, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that "Bigelow does say there are moments of fiction, and Boal notes instances of 'pure screenwriting.' Some facts are contested within accounts; others were changed for the screen" and then raised the question "Does a disclaimer at the end sufficiently cover fictional manipulations in an ostensibly true story?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-detroit-bigelow-20170727-story.html|title=Kathryn Bigelow's 'Detroit' takes on a tragedy then — and now - Los Angeles Times|first=Steven|last=Zeitchik|website=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] went so far as to state that Bigelow and Boal "changed names [of characters] so as to enjoy other creative liberties in the storytelling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/does-detroit-risk-a-lawsuit-real-life-cops-1026426|title=Does 'Detroit' Risk a Lawsuit From Real-Life Cops?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such subject whose name was dropped in favor of a fictional one is lawyer Norman Lippitt (played in the film by actor [[John Krasinski]] under the name Auerbach).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20170722/news/634586/lawyer-who-earned-fame-defending-detroit-police-in-algiers-motel-case|title=Lawyer who earned fame defending Detroit police in Algiers Motel case recalls legacy|website=Crain's Detroit Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the historical criticism, Boal said, "I employed poetic license, under a self-imposed rule to never stray from what I understood to be the underlying truth of a scene or an event. This script is built on a sturdy base of journalism and history, but it is not the same as journalism or history, nor does it aspire to be. As a screenwriter, I take the responsibility of being the creator of a tale, of transforming these raw materials into a drama."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/detroit/|title=Detroit Movie vs. the True Story of the Algiers Motel Killings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She first became known for her candid memoir, ''[[Candy Girl: A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper]]'' (2005), and the [[blog]] that preceded it. Later, Cody achieved critical acclaim for her debut feature film script, ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' (2007), winning awards such as the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]], the [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay]], the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay]], and the [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay]].

She is also known for creating, writing, and producing [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s television series ''[[United States of Tara]]'' (2009–2011) and for writing and producing the films ''[[Jennifer's Body]]'' (2009) and ''[[Young Adult (film)|Young Adult]]'' (2011).

==Early life and career==
Cody and her older brother Marc were born and raised in [[Lemont, Illinois]], a suburb of Chicago. She is the daughter of Pam and Greg Busey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-12-09/news/0712070510_1_mason-novick-hollywood-film-festival-diablo-cody |title=From Lemont to Hollywood, with a pole dance in between |date=9 December 2007 |last=Schaults |first=Janine |website=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother is of Italian descent and her father is of British ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G23CRWNF3IU; stated at 19:55&lt;/ref&gt; Cody was raised Catholic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inkedmag.com/article/diablo-cody-says-no/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316052258/http://www.inkedmag.com/article/diablo-cody-says-no/|archivedate=March 16, 2010 |title=Diablo Cody Says No|publisher=(interview), ''[[Inked (magazine)|Inked]]''| date= September 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attended [[Benet Academy]], a Roman Catholic school in [[Lisle, Illinois]]. She took the pen name Diablo Cody (''diablo'' is Spanish for "devil") after repeatedly listening to the song "El Diablo" by [[Arcadia (band)|Arcadia]]&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20157948,00.html| title = Diablo Cody: From Ex-Stripper to A-Lister| accessdate = 2008-04-16| last = Valby|first=Karen| date = November 5, 2007| work = [[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while passing through [[Cody, Wyoming]].&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; She graduated from the [[University of Iowa]] with a [[media studies]] degree.&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{cite news|last= Desson|first= Thomson|title= Hollywood takes a shine to 'Juno' writer's body of work|publisher= ''[[The Washington Post]]'' via Boston.com|date= 2007-12-15|url= http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2007/12/15/hollywood_takes_a_shine_to_juno_writers_body_of_work/|page = [http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2007/12/15/hollywood_takes_a_shine_to_juno_writers_body_of_work/?page=2 2]|accessdate= 2008-01-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100207020629/http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2007/12/15/hollywood_takes_a_shine_to_juno_writers_body_of_work/?page=2| archivedate=February 7, 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the [[University of Iowa]], she worked in the acquisitions department in the main university library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.lib.uiowa.edu/news/2008/02/|title=Former Student Assistant Wins Oscar|publisher=[[University of Iowa]] Libraries|date=February 26, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716155044/http://blog.lib.uiowa.edu/news/2008/02/ |archivedate=July 16, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first jobs were doing secretarial work at a Chicago law firm and later [[proofreading]] [[copy (written)|copy]] for advertisements that played on [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]] radio stations.

Cody began a [[parody]] [[weblog|blog]] called ''Red Secretary'', detailing the (fictional) exploits of a secretary living in [[Belarus]].&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{cite news|last= Abramowitz|first= Rachel|title= Diablo Cody: From stripper to screenwriter|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date= 2007-12-06|archiveurl= http://world-news-live.blogspot.com/2007/12/diablo-cody-from-stripper-to.html| archivedate=2008-02-25|url= http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-cody6dec06,0,5969724.story|accessdate= 2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events were thinly-veiled allegories for events that happened in Cody's real life, but told from the perspective of a disgruntled, English-[[idiom]]-challenged [[Eastern Bloc]] girl.

Her first ''bona fide'' blog appeared under the nickname ''Darling Girl'' after she had moved from Chicago to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt;

==Stripping and journalism==
On a whim, Cody signed up for amateur night at a Minneapolis strip club called the Skyway Lounge.&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt;  Having enjoyed the experience, she eventually quit her day job to become a full-time stripper.&lt;ref name="unlikely"&gt;{{cite news|last= Scott|first= Megan|title= Unlikely pole dancer tells strippers' story|publisher= ''Orange County Register''|date= 2006-03-10|url= http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/life/features/lifestyle/article_1032959.php|accessdate= 2008-01-30|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080116224306/http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/life/features/lifestyle/article_1032959.php|archivedate= 2008-01-16|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cody also spent time working peep shows at Sex World, a Minneapolis adult novelty and DVD store.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

While still stripping, Cody began writing for ''[[City Pages]]'', an alternative [[Twin Cities]] weekly newspaper.&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt;  She left ''City Pages'' just before it changed editorial hands, and has since written for the now-defunct ''[[Jane magazine|Jane]]'' magazine.  In December 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20166555,00.html |title=Diablo Cody: As the Crowe Flies? |publisher=EW.com |date=2007-12-17 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cody began writing a column for the magazine ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.

At the age of 27, Cody wrote her memoir ''[[Candy Girl: A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper]]''. The memoir began after [[Mason Novick]], who would soon become Cody's manager, showed interest in her sharp and sarcastic voice. Based on the popularity of her blog, ''The Pussy Ranch'', he was able to secure her a publishing contract with [[Gotham Books]].

==Screenwriting==
[[File:Diablo Cody2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cody, January 2008]]

In October 2007, Cody sold a script titled ''Girly Style'' to [[Universal Studios]], and a horror script called ''[[Jennifer's Body]]'' to [[Fox Atomic]].&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite news|last= Covert|first= Colin|title= Interview: Diablo Cody: Dancing as fast as she can|publisher= ''Minneapolis Star Tribune''|date= 2007-12-07|url= http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/movies/12219916.html|accessdate= 2008-01-30|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080209163008/http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/movies/12219916.html|archivedate= 2008-02-09|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Released on September 18, 2009, ''Jennifer's Body'' starred [[Megan Fox]] as the title character and [[Amanda Seyfried]] as the supporting character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Covert |first=Colin |title=In Defense Of 'Jennifer’s Body' |date=2007-12-07 |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3329313/defense-jennifers-body/ |website=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |accessdate=2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She revised writer-director [[Steven Antin]]'s script for his musical film ''[[Burlesque (2010 American film)|Burlesque]]''.&lt;ref name=burlesque&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117974104|date=October 15, 2007|title=Screen Gems enlists Antin for 'Burlesque'|first=Michael |last=Fleming|accessdate=November 18, 2011|journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118000000/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117974104|archivedate=November 18, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cody is a friend of screenwriters [[Dana Fox]] (''[[What Happens in Vegas]]'', ''[[Couples Retreat]]'') and [[Lorene Scafaria]] (''[[Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist]]'') and they often write their screenplays together in order to get advice from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Dulcie Sybil Holland'''&lt;ref&gt;Also known by her married name as Dulcie Bellhouse or Mrs Dulcie Sybil Bellhouse.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Order of Australia|AM]] (5 January 1913 &amp;ndash; 21 May 2000) was an Australian [[composer]] and music educator. Best known for her contributions to music education through her energetic involvement with the [[Australian Music Examinations Board]], Holland has in recent decades gained greater recognition as a composer. She is now regarded by some critics as one of the more significant Australian composers of her generation.

==Education==
Dulcie Holland was born in [[Sydney]] in 1913. She began taking piano lessons at the age of six, and attended Shirley School for Girls, known for its academic excellence. In 1929 she entered the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music (now the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music|Sydney Conservatorium]]) to continue her studies. At the Conservatorium she studied [[piano]] with [[Grace Middenway]] and [[Frank Hutchens]], [[cello]] with [[Gladstone Bell]], and composition with [[Roy Agnew]] and [[Alfred Hill (composer)|Alfred Hill]], eventually completing both the Diploma course (DSCM) and the [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] of the [[Royal Schools of Music]] (LRSM) in 1933.

In 1936, Holland travelled to [[London]] to study composition at the [[Royal College of Music]] with [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]]. At the end of her first year, she won the Blumenthal Scholarship for composition, which entitled her to another three years of study at the College. The following year she won the Cobbett Prize for [[chamber music]], but with the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, decided to return to Australia.

Several years after the war, in 1951, she returned to the United Kingdom for a year to study [[serialism]] with [[Mátyás Seiber]].

==Career==
After returning to Australia from the Royal College in 1939, Holland embarked on a career as a recitalist and freelance composer. In 1940 she married the Australian [[Conducting|conductor]] [[Alan Bellhouse]], with whom she would have two children. During the 1940s, in addition to her childrearing and composing, she wrote a number of children's books, under her married name of Dulcie Bellhouse. She also began to write music for the North Shore Symphony Orchestra (founded and conducted by her husband), an association that would continue for 25 years.

In the 1950s, Holland was commissioned to write [[Film score|musical score]]s for the [[Minister for Home Affairs (Australia)|Department of the Interior]], which was then producing a number of documentary films about Australian life for the new wave of migrants entering the country. She eventually wrote the scores for forty of these films.

In 1967, Holland joined the [[Australian Music Examinations Board]] (AMEB) as an examiner.&lt;ref&gt;Music Australia website.&lt;/ref&gt; During her long association with the Board, her prolific output of musical studies and pieces for students at all levels of development, along with her authorship of numerous music theory books, were eventually to make her a familiar name in thousands of Australian households.  Sales of her didactic writings made her Australia's most celebrated music author.

After her retirement from AMEB in 1983, Holland continued to compose, but chose to focus more on the writing of music text books, on the ground that she believed "making new converts to music" to be more important than adding to the volume of existing music.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller and LeFanu, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, she was made a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM).  In 1993, along with [[Miriam Hyde]], she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters (D.Litt.) by [[Macquarie University]].

==Music==
Throughout the course of her seventy-year career, Holland produced a considerable body of serious (as opposed to educational) music. Her work includes orchestral pieces (including a symphony), vocal and choral works, a large output of chamber music featuring different combinations of instruments, and many pieces for piano and other solo performance. She wrote in both the contemporary and neo-classical genres.

===Style===
Dulcie Holland has been described as "less conservative and more appealing than many of her contemporaries".&lt;ref name=resonate/&gt; Her music is generally "melodic, optimistic and sunny", and even her darker moods are "reflective and lyrical".&lt;ref name=sitmar43&gt;Sitsky and Martin, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; She employs "non-traditional key relationships and swiftly changing tonal centres",&lt;ref name=resonate&gt;''Resonate''.&lt;/ref&gt; and is "fond of the pentatonic scale with its built-in ambiguities, and the possibilities thus given to modulate to unexpected keys".&lt;ref name=sitmar43/&gt; Overall however, her music is said to convey a "sense of balance, of confidence, of individuality [and] of formal structure".&lt;ref name=resonate/&gt;

===Major works===
In addition to the symphony and string quartet, Holland's ''Piano Sonata'' has been called "undoubtedly a landmark work in the Australian oeuvre",&lt;ref&gt;Sitsky and Martin, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; while her 1944 ''Trio for Violin, Cello and Piano'' has been described as "one of the greatest treasures of Australian music".&lt;ref name=amc&gt;Australian Music Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting Holland's difficulty in gaining recognition as a serious composer through much of her lifetime, the latter work did not receive its first public performance until 1991, 47 years after it was first written.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdbaby.com/cd/revolve20 ''Australian Classics''], CD Baby website.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Femme de la rue''' (''Woman of the street'') is a 2012 [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[documentary]] made by [[Sofie Peeters]]. It runs for 25 minutes and deals with the subject of [[sexual harassment]] against women in the city of [[Brussels]]. 
This documentary was broadcast by [[Canvas (Belgium)|Canvas]] on 26 July 2012. It caused a lot of commotion in both Belgian and Dutch politics about penalizing the harassment of women.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Blyth, ''[http://www.flanderstoday.eu/politics/sexual-harassment-illegal-under-new-belgian-law Sexual harassment illegal under new Belgian law]''. Flanders Today. 14 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Sofie Peeters, the author of this documentary, was a student of audiovisual arts at {{ill|Royal Institute for Theatre, Cinema and Sound|nl|RITCS}} (RITCS) at the time of filming. She had moved to [[Brussels]] for these studies, where she was harassed on a daily basis by men on the streets. She decided to film those experiences and turn them into a documentary on sexual street harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} Astrid Snoeys, [http://www.demorgen.be/tvmedia/seksisme-in-brussel-aan-de-kaak-gesteld-in-femme-de-la-rue-b91c433c/ Seksisme in Brussel aan de kaak gesteld in 'Femme de la rue']. De Morgen. 26 July 2012.
&lt;/ref&gt;

This documentary makes use of a [[hidden camera]]. A young woman walks through the streets of Brussels while carrying a hidden camera. The main spots she passes by are the {{ill|Boulevard Maurice Lemonnier|fr}} (Maurice Lemonnierlaan) and the {{ill|Place Anneessens|fr}} (Anneessensplein). During this walk, she is continuously bothered by men who yell at her, offend her, and try to impose themselves unto her. Nearly all the offenders are of Peeters are of North African origin which led to a debate about a cultural border which was not the intent of the author but showed to be important to consider. This documentary also features women of both autochthone and allochthone backgrounds who talk about their experiences while walking the streets of Brussels.

New possibilities opened up by the concept of [[four-dimensional space]] (and difficulties involved in trying to visualize it) helped inspire many modern artists in the first half of the twentieth century. Early [[Cubists]], [[Surrealists]], [[Futurists]], and [[Abstract art|abstract]] artists took ideas from higher-dimensional mathematics and used them to radically advance their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/fourth-dimension-and-non-euclidean-geometry-modern-art |title=Overview of ''The Fourth Dimension And Non-Euclidean Geometry In Modern Art, Revised Edition'' |first1=Linda Dalrymple|last1=Henderson |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Picasso Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler 1910.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Picasso's ''Portrait of [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'', 1910, [[The Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1912-1913, L'Oiseau bleu, (The Blue Bird) oil on canvas, 230 x 196 cm, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris..jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]], 1912-1913, ''[[L'Oiseau bleu (Metzinger)|L'Oiseau bleu, (The Blue Bird)]]'', oil on canvas, 230 x 196 cm, [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]]]]

French [[mathematician]] [[Maurice Princet]] was known as "le mathématicien du cubisme" ("the mathematician of cubism").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Décimo |first=Marc |title=Maurice Princet, Le Mathématicien du Cubisme |year=2007 |publisher=Éditions L'Echoppe |location=Paris |language=French |isbn=2-84068-191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An associate of the [[School of Paris]], a group of [[Avant-garde|avant-gardists]] including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Jean Metzinger]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]], Princet is credited with introducing the work of [[Henri Poincaré]] and the concept of the "[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]" to the cubists at the [[Le Bateau-Lavoir|Bateau-Lavoir]] during the first decade of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Arthur I. |title=Einstein, Picasso: space, time, and beauty that causes havoc |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2001 |type=Print|page=101 |isbn=0-465-01859-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princet introduced Picasso to [[Esprit Jouffret]]'s ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions'' (''Elementary Treatise on the Geometry of Four Dimensions'', 1903),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jouffret |first=Esprit |title=Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions et introduction à la géométrie à n dimensions |url=http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=04810001 |accessdate=2008-02-06 |year=1903 |publisher=Gauthier-Villars |location=Paris |language=French |oclc=1445172}}&lt;/ref&gt; a popularization of Poincaré's ''Science and Hypothesis'' in which Jouffret described [[hypercube]]s and other complex [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]] in four [[dimension]]s and projected them onto the two-dimensional page. Picasso's ''[[Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'' in 1910 was an important work for the artist, who spent many months shaping it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robbin |first=Tony |title=Shadows of Reality: The Fourth Dimension in Relativity, Cubism, and Modern Thought |page=28 |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |type=Print |year=2006|isbn= 9780300110395}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait bears similarities to Jouffret's work and shows a distinct movement away from the [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] [[fauvism]] displayed in ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', to a more considered analysis of space and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robbin |first=Tony |title=Shadows of Reality: The Fourth Dimension in Relativity, Cubism, and Modern Thought  |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |type=Print|pages=28–30 |year=2006|isbn= 9780300110395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early cubist [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]] wrote an article entitled "In The Fourth Dimension from a Plastic Point of View", for [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s July 1910 issue of ''[[Camera Work]]''. In the piece, Weber states, "In plastic art, I believe, there is a fourth dimension which may be described as the consciousness of a great and overwhelming sense of space-magnitude in all directions at one time, and is brought into existence through the three known measurements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Max |last1=Weber |authorlink=Max Weber |year=1910 |title=In The Fourth Dimension from a Plastic Point of View |journal= [[Camera Work]]|volume= 31|issue= July 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence on the School of Paris was that of [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Albert Gleizes]], both painters and theoreticians. The first major treatise written on the subject of Cubism was their 1912 collaboration ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', which says that:&lt;blockquote&gt; "If we wished to relate the space of the [Cubist] painters to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidian mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of [[Bernhard Riemann#Euclidean geometry versus Riemannian geometry|Riemann's theorems]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Du "Cubisme" (Edition Figuière)| first1=Albert| first2= Jean| last1=Gleizes |last2=Metzinger |authorlink1=Albert Gleizes |authorlink2=Jean Metzinger |location=Paris|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The American modernist painter and photographer [[Morton Livingston Schamberg]] wrote in 1910 two letters to [[Walter Pach]],&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Schamberg in Philadelphia to Walter Pach in Paris, 29 December 1910, Pach Papers, Reel: 4216, fr. 856&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Schamberg in Philadelphia to Pach in Paris, 29
December 1910, fr. 857&lt;/ref&gt; parts of which were published in a review of the [[Armory Show|1913 Armory Show]] for ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Morton Livingston Schamberg, "Post-Impression Exhibit Awaited", ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', 19 January 1913, col. 2, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; about the influence of the fourth dimension on avant-garde painting; describing how the artists' employed "harmonic use of forms" distinguishing between the "representation or rendering of space and the designing in space":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oja|first1=Carol J.|title=Making Music Modern: New York in the 1920s|page=84|year=2000, February 2003|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA}}{{ISBN|9780195162578}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we still further add to design in the third dimension, a consideration of weight, pressure, resistance, movement, as distinguished from motion, we arrive at what may legitimately be called design in the fourth dimension, or the harmonic use of what may arbitrarily be called volume. It is only at this point that we can appreciate the masterly productions of such a man as Cézanne.&lt;ref&gt;[https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/33294 Jill Anderson Kyle, ''Cézanne and American Painting 1900 to 1920''], The University of Texas at Austin, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired the Cubists to experiment with [[simultaneity]], complex multiple views of the same subject, as observed from differing viewpoints at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism, Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensionist manifesto==
In 1936 in Paris, [[Charles Sirato|Charles Tamkó Sirató]] published his ''Manifeste Dimensioniste'',&lt;ref name="dimensionalist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artpool.hu/TamkoSirato/manifest.html |title=Dimensionist Manifesto |first1=Charles Tamkó |last1=Sirató |location=Paris |year=1936 |format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which described how {{quote|the Dimensionist tendency has led to: 
# Literature leaving the line and entering the plane. 
# Painting leaving the plane and entering space.
# Sculpture stepping out of closed, immobile forms.
# …The artistic conquest of four-dimensional space, which to date has been completely art-free.}}

The manifesto was signed by many prominent modern artists worldwide. [[Hans Arp]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and Marcel Duchamp amongst others added their names in Paris, then a short while later it was endorsed by artists abroad including [[László Moholy-Nagy]], [[Joan Miró]], [[David Kakabadze]], [[Alexander Calder]], and [[Ben Nicholson]].&lt;ref name="dimensionalist"/&gt;

==''Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)''==
[[File:Dali Crucifixion hypercube.jpg|150px|thumb|Dalí's 1954 painting ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'']]
In 1953, the [[surrealist]] [[Salvador Dalí]] proclaimed his intention to paint "an explosive, nuclear and hypercubic" crucifixion scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalí |first1=Salvador |authorlink1=Salvador Dalí|last2=Gómez de la Serna|first2=Ramón  |title=Dali |location=Secaucus, NJ |publisher=Wellfleet Press |origyear=1988 |year=2001  |page=41 |isbn=1555213421}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spanisharts.com/history/del_impres_s.XX/arte_sXX/vanguardias1/i_surrealismo_dali.html |title=Salvador Dalí (1904–1989) |publisher=SpanishArts |year=2013 |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that, "This picture will be the great metaphysical work of my summer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dali-gallery.com/html/analyses/1954_02a.htm |title=Crucifixion ('Corpus Hypercubus'), 1954 |publisher=Dalí gallery website |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completed the next year, ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'' depicts Jesus Christ upon the net of a hypercube, also known as a [[tesseract]]. The unfolding of a tesseract into eight cubes is analogous to unfolding the sides of a cube into six squares. The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] describes the painting as a "new interpretation of an oft-depicted subject. ..[showing] Christ's spiritual triumph over corporeal harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/210009107 |title= ''Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)'' |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstract art==
Some of [[Piet Mondrian]]'s (1872–1944) abstractions and his practice of [[Neoplasticism]] are said to be rooted in his view of a utopian universe, with perpendiculars visually extending into another dimension.&lt;ref name="Kruger"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Runette |last1=Kruger |title=Art in the Fourth Dimension: Giving Form to Form – The Abstract Paintings of Piet Mondrian |publisher=Spaces of Utopia: An Electronic Journal |number=5 |date=Summer 2007 |pages=23–35 |url=http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/4351.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |issn=1646-4729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''G7 Method''' is a printing procedure used for visually accurate color reproduction by putting emphasis on matching grayscale colorimetric measurements between processes. G7 stands for '''g'''rayscale plus '''seven''' colors: the [[subtractive colors]] typically used in printing (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) and the [[additive colors]] (Red, Green, and Blue). The method is used in many applications of printing such as [[offset lithography]], [[flexography]], and [[gravure]] since it uses a one-dimensional neutral print density curve (NPDC) to match neutral tonality between two G7 calibrated printing systems. The G7 method is not a completely accurate color management system nor is it officially standardized by the [[International Color Consortium]] (ICC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idealliance.org/specifications/g7/what-g7 |title=What is G7? |publisher=IDEAlliance |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The G7 method was created by Don Hutcheson, chairman of the IDEAlliance GRACoL (International Digital Enterprise Alliance, General Requirements for Applications in Commercial Offset Lithography) in 2006. It was created to solve the problem of [[computer to plate]] (CtP) printing systems and other devices printing images with different tonal value increases (TVIs), or [[dot gain]]s. Also, professionals in the printing industry follow the [[International Organization for Standardization]]’s (ISO) principles of [[half-tone]] printing, called ISO 12647-2, which does not specify colorimetric values for gray balance and refers to multiple TVI curves. This results in an ambiguous definition of the print’s final ‘appearance’.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.efi.com/~/media/Files/EFI/Fiery/Fiery%20Digital%20Print%20Servers/Demystifying%20Color%20Standards_hr.pdf |title=Demystifying Color Standards |publisher=W3.efi.com |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The G7 method solved this problem by creating Neutral Print Density Curves (NPDC) that related neutral density to the half-tone dot percentages of a print image rather than a TVI curve relating the input dot percentage to the output gain relative to the input percentage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Definition==

===Basic Set-up===
To calibrate a printing system with the G7 method, it basically entails comparing the NPDC generated by the device to the ‘ideal’ NPDC given in G7 specifications, calibrating the [[Raster Image Processor]] (RIP) or the driver of the device, and then repeating the NPDC comparison to check for accuracy. More specifically, one dimensional interpolation between the NPDC graph generated by the printer and the GRACoL 7 NPDC “FanGraph” must be done to generate new dot percentage aim values to be given to the device’s RIP or driver.&lt;ref name="hkprinters1"&gt;[http://www.aptec.hkprinters.org/IDEAlliance-China/resource_centre/free_resources/08-G7_how-to_v6 ]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorimetry===
The G7 method's emphasis on grayscale calibration is loosely based around the concept of neutralizing the camera image of a scene using a [[gray card]]. This is done to lower the effects of lighting conditions, such as [[color temperature]], on the resulting image. G7 takes this further by defining percentages of cyan, magenta, and yellow ink at which the image should be gray balanced. It also defines values for a* and b* for the [[Lab color space]].&lt;ref name="hkprinters1"/&gt;

Most printing systems use [[half-tone]]s to generate images by using a series of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black dots to recreate colors. This is done by varying the size of the dots so that the human eye can spatially integrate the image's color and make it look like one uniform color.

===Benefits and disadvantages===
Using the G7 method for printing calibration is a manual process and is device independent, meaning it can be used for any printing devices that allows manipulation of the [[raster image processor]] or [[computer to plate]] curve information that dictates how digital signals from an image is printed with ink.

However, since the G7 method relies mostly on gray balance, if the image does not contain much gray information, the calibration can be inaccurate. Also, using any offset printing may be difficult to gray balance because it involves "wet-trapping" which can lead to unpredictable values for dark tones.&lt;ref name="hkprinters1"/&gt;

==Software==
'''IDEAlink Curve'''
Calibration using the G7 method involves comparing two NPDCs from the G7 Fangraph to calculate new aim values that will be given to the printer's RIP files. This can be a manual process, but the IDEAlink curve software, created by IDEAlliance, does this automatically and with minimal error. Improvements to this program include Curve2 and Curve3. ''IDEAlink Curve 1.1 software is no longer commercially available''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Certified G7 Systems {{!}} Idealliance|url = http://www.idealliance.org/certifications/g7-certifications/g7-system-certification/certified-g7-systems|website = www.idealliance.org|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the list below for systems and software that have received G7 System Certification.

IDEAlliance certifies systems and software that meet or exceed established industry tolerances for excellence and are capable of calibrating a printing device to meet the G7 grayscale definition using four 1-D curves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue''' (also '''GWK statue''') is a 121-meter tall statue located in [[Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park]]. It was designed by Nyoman Nuarta and inaugurated in September 2018. The total height of the monument, including the 46-meter base pedestal is {{cvt|121|m}}. The statue is about 30m higher than the [[Statue of Liberty]], but Liberty is tall and thin, while Garuda is almost as wide as it is high — its wingspan is 64m. The statue was designed to be the Indonesia’s tallest statue, that was inspired by a Hindu myth about the search for [[Amrita]] (the elixir of life). According to this myth, [[Garuda]] agreed to be ridden by [[Vishnu]] in return for the right to use the elixir to liberate his enslaved mother. The monument was completed on 31 July 2018 and inaugurated by Indonesian President [[Joko Widodo]] on 22 September, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/president-joko-widodo-unveils-indonesias-tallest-statue|title=President Joko Widodo unveils Indonesia's tallest statue|newspaper=The Straits Times|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|URL=http://travel.kompas.com/read/2018/09/22/223035427/jokowi-resmikan-patung-gwk-terwujud-setelah-28-tahun|title=Jokowi resmikan patunng GWK terwujud setelah 28 Tahun|newspaper=Kompas|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
It took twenty-eight years and around $100 million to build the statue. GWK was designed back in 1990 by Nyoman Nuarta under the auspices of then tourism minister Joop Ave,energy minister IB Sudjana and Bali governor IB Oka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2018/08/02/garuda-wisnu-kencana-precious-gift-for-independence-day.html|title=Garuda Wisnu Kencana: Precious gift for Independence Day|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The groundbreaking event of the statue’s construction took place 1997. In the late 1990s, the project was brought to a sudden halt by the combining force of the global economic crisis. The construction work resumed in 2013 after a sixteen year hiatus, when property developer PT. Alam Sutera Realty Tbk (ASR) agreed to financing the construction of the statue and the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2018/09/24/199921924/5-Astonishing-Facts-of-Balis-Garuda-Wisnu-Kencana-Statue|title=5 Astonishing Facts of Bali`s Garuda Wisnu Kencana Statue|newspaper=Tempo|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;The idea for the monument was not without controversy; religious authorities on the island complained that its massive size might disrupt the spiritual balance of the island, and that its commercial nature was inappropriate, but some groups agree with the project, because it will be a new tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/bali-daily/2013-07-24/nuarta-resurrects-tallest-wisnu-statue.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130724065106/http://www.thejakartapost.com/bali-daily/2013-07-24/nuarta-resurrects-tallest-wisnu-statue.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 24, 2013 |title=Nuarta ‘resurrects’ tallest Wisnu statue |date=July 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue was assembled in Bali from 754 discrete modules that were constructed in [[Bandung]], West Java and then transported to the work site. The modules were cut into 1,500 smaller pieces to accommodate the cranes maximum load. The last piece that was placed onto the gigantic artwork was at its tail, which is located at the highest point of the statue. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Spectacular GARUDA WISNU KENCANA STATUE on Bali in Final Stage of Completion |url=https://www.indonesia.travel/us/en/news/spectacular-garuda-wisnu-kencana-statue-on-bali-in-final-stage-of-completion |publisher=Ministry of Tourism, Republic of Indonesia |accessdate=26 September 2018 |date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garuda's shape is so complex that engineers have designed special joints in the supporting structure, with up to 11 enormous steel girders coming together at the same point, whereas normal construction joints have four or six girders. The Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue is designed to withstand storms and earthquakes, and expected to last for the next 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-11/bali-buliding-worlds-biggest-statue-garuda-wisnu-kencana/8600760|title=Bali statue of Hindu god Wisnu to be world's largest|newspaper=ABC|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The completed monument is about as tall as a 21-storey building. It weighs 4000 tonnes, making it the heaviest statue in Indonesia. The artwork is made of copper and brass supported by 21,000 steel bars, and bolts of 170,000. The statue is made of copper and brass sheeting, with a stainless steel frame and skeleton, as well as a steel and concrete core column. The outer covering measures {{val|22000|u=m2}} in area. The crown of Vishnu is covered with golden mosaics and the statue has a dedicated lighting arrangement. The sculpture sits atop a building base which will function as a restaurant, museum, and viewing gallery.

The '''Gawad CCP Para sa Sining''' ( '''CCP Awards for the Arts''' ), which is given every three years, or triennial event is awarded to artists or groups of artists who have consistently produced outstanding works, enriched the development of their art form. The award is also given to cultural workers, who through their works in research, curatorship and administration, have helped to develop and enrich Philippine art .  This is the highest award given by the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] (CCP) to Filipino artists and cultural workers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturalcenter.gov.ph/press-room/2015-gawad-ccp-para-sa-sining-awardees-named/ |title=2015 Fawad CCP para sa Sining Awardees |accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first Gawad CCP Para sa Sining was given posthumously in 1977 to Hubertus Kuhne for Cultural Administration, Kuhne being the head of the Goethe Institut in Manila at that time. The Award since then was given yearly until 1994. In 1996, the Award became the Gawad CCP Para sa Sining Pangtanghalan, reflecting the new thrust of the CCP as Center for the Performing Arts, instead of a Coordinating Center for all arts. The Gawad CCP para sa Sining awards has been revived in 2004, with the awarding ceremonies held on September 8, 2004 at the Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo of the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]]. The event fittingly coincided with the celebration of the institution’s 35th year anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/in-focus/ccp-continues-tradition-of-recognition-of-filipino-artists-and-cultural-workers/ |title=In Focus: CCP Continues Tradition of Recognition of Filipino Artists and Cultural Workers|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gawad CCP Para sa Sining covers the following art forms: dance, music, theater, literature, film, visual arts, broadcast arts, technical theater and production design. The award also has three categories:

The '''Kerameikos steles''' are a collection of sculptures used as grave-markers ([[steles]], sing. stele) in the [[Kerameikos]] necropolis of Attica. [[Kerameikos]] is located outside the [[Themistoclean Wall]]'s [[Dipylon Gate]]. Stelai come in various shapes/designs and depict images varying from pottery to narrative scenes. They were often marble or limestone, and were carved or sculpted to depict the person being memorialized sometimes with relatives or slaves. Reliefs decorating the graves were meant to show the dead in their best light, using imagery to recognize their bravery in battle, or pathos, or wealth. These monuments marked the graves of Athenian men, fallen warriors, as well as non-citizens.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Hook|first=LaRue|date=1932|title=On the Lacedaemonians Buried in the Kerameikos|jstor=498389|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=36|issue=3|pages=290–292|doi=10.2307/498389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were also included in Kerameikos but typically it was the wealthiest or prominent women who were given stele.&lt;ref&gt;[[Evelyn Lord Smithson|Smithson, E.]] (1968).

Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/147539&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In many vase paintings of grave scenes wreaths are seen resting at the base of stele. This was likely a popular way to adorn the graves of Greek loved ones.

== History ==
The first steles were dated from the [[Early Bronze Age]], around 2000 B.C. The use of steles as grave markers gained popularity in Kerameikos around the [[Geometric art|Protogeometric period]] c.a. 950 B.C.E. until they fell out of style around the 8th century C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Blegen, C. (1952). Two Athenian Grave Groups of about 900 B.C. ''Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens,'' ''21''(4), 279-294. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org.proxy.wm.edu/stable/146860&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The site was first excavated in 1870 by German archaeologists looking for grave-goods.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexandridou|first=Alexandra|date=2016|title=Funerary Variability in Late Eighth-Century B.C.E.

Many graves and buildings had been destroyed so they were used as building material.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, L. (1962). The Inscribed Gravestones of Archaic Attica.

== Styles ==
[[File:Dexileos.JPG|left|300x300px|thumb|Grave Stele of Dexileos]]
Athenians used Kerameikos for centuries to bury their dead. Over time different styles were introduced so there is a great variety of graves that came from Kerameikos. Notable styles found in Kerameikos include the naiskos stele, lekythos graves, and kore.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, L. (1962). The Inscribed Gravestones of Archaic Attica. ''The Annual of the British School at Athens,'' ''57'', 115-153. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/30104502&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Graves were inscribed with the name of the deceased and where they came from.

Some steles at Kerameikos used a style known as [[naiskos]] ("small temple"), which looks like a temple with columns and a pediment at the top. This particular symbol of wealth gained popularity in the 5th century B.C. examples include the [[Grave Stele of Dexileos]] and the [[Grave Stele of Hegeso]].

== Notable burials and graves ==
After the Battle of Chairon and Thibrachos, [[Lacedaemonian]] soldiers of [[Pausanias of Sparta|King Pausanias]]' army were buried at Kerameikos. The tomb was found marked by a marble plinth with Lacedaemonian inscriptions of the names of the men.&lt;ref&gt;Van Hook, L. (1932). On the Lacedaemonians Buried in the Kerameikos. ''American Journal of Archaeology,'' ''36''(3), 290-292. doi:10.2307/498389&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Terracotta lekythos (oil flask) MET 835.jpg|thumb|346x346px|Lekythos vase depicting a woman visiting a stele grave and carrying with an offering for the gods. Note the wreath decoration.]]
The [[Grave Stele of Hegeso]] is one of the best-preserved surviving attic stele and features a woman seated by her servant. This grave is a naiskos, meaning Hegeso was likely a prominent woman as this style signified wealth and importance.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, L.M.W. (1905). ''A History of Ancient Sculpture''. New York: Dodd, Mead, &amp; Co. pp. 499–501.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Locations ==
Today the Kerameikos grave monuments can be found at the [[Kerameikos Archaeological Museum]] where many of them are preserved and kept on display.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10394">In philosophical discourse, '''lexis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: λέξις "word") is a complete group of words in a language, vocabulary, the total set of all words in a language, and all words that have meaning or a function in grammar.

== Lexis according to Plato ==

According to [[Plato]], lexis is the manner of speaking. Plato said that lexis can be divided into [[mimesis]] (imitation properly speaking) and [[diegesis]] (simple narrative). Gerard Genette states: "Plato's theoretical division, opposing the two pure and heterogeneous modes of narrative and imitation, within poetic diction, elicits and establishes a practical classification of genres, which includes the two distinct modes...and a mixed mode, for example the Iliad".&lt;ref&gt;"Boundaries of a Narrative," ''New Literary History'', Vol. 8, No. 1, Readers and Spectators: Some Views and Reviews (Autumn, 1976), pp. 1–13. JSTOR. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the ''[[Iliad]]'', a Greek epic written by Homer, the mixed mode is very prevalent. According to [[Gerald Prince]], diegesis in the ''Iliad'' is the fictional storytelling associated with the fictional world and the enacting/re-telling of the story. Mimesis in the'' Iliad'' is the imitation of everyday, yet fantastical life in the ancient Greek world. Diegesis and mimesis combined represent the fullest extent of lexis; both forms of speech, narrating and re-enacting.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Prince. ''A Dictionary of Narratolog''y. 2003. University of Nebraska Press&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In conclusion, lexis is the larger overview of literature. Within lexis the two areas of differentiation of mimesis (imitation) are diegesis (narrative) and the "direct representation of the actors speaking to the public."&lt;ref&gt;Gennette 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lexis according to Aristotle ==

According to Jose M. Gonzalez, "Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis."&lt;ref&gt;Jose M. Gonzalez, "Phantasia and Aristotle." JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt; Pistis is the Greek word for faith and is one of the rhetorical modes of persuasion.
 
Gonzalez also points out that, "By invoking phantasia, lexis against the background Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis." [[Phantasia (philosophy)|Phantasia]] is a Greek word meaning the process by which all images are presented to us. Aristotle defines phantasia as "our desire for the mind to mediate anything not actually present to the senses with a mental image." &lt;ref&gt;Jana Noel. "Interpreting Aristotle's Phantasia and Claiming its Role Within Phronesis". 1997.[http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/eps/PES-Yearbook/97_docs/noel.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle instructs the reader to use his or her imagination to create the fantastic, unordinary images, all the while using narrative and re-enactment to create a play either written or produced.

== Elements of rhetorical diction according to Aristotle ==

Although Aristotle at times seems to demean the art of diction or 'voice,' saying that it is not an "elevated subject of inquiry," he does go into quite a bit of detail on its importance and its proper use in rhetorical speech.  Often calling it "style," he defines good style as follows: that it must be clear and avoid extremes of baseness and loftiness.  Aristotle makes the cases for the importance of diction by saying that, "it is not enough to know what we ought to say; we must also say it as we ought.".&lt;ref&gt;''The Rhetoric and the Poetics of Aristotle''. Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. Ed.  [[Donald McQuade|Donald, McQuade]]. New York: The Modern Library, 1984, p. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; In an oratorical speech, one must consider not only the facts, but also how to put the facts into words and which words and, also, the "proper method of delivery." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle goes on to say that only the facts in an argument should be important but that since the listeners can be swayed by diction, it must also be considered. 
 
'''Voice''' 

At the time when Aristotle wrote his treatise on Rhetoric, orators had not paid much attention to voice.  They thought it was a subject only of concern to actors and poets. In ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|The Rhetoric]]'', Aristotles says, "proper method of delivery…affects the success of a speech greatly; but hitherto the subject has been neglected." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle defined voice as controlling one's voice, using rate, volume and pitch, to convey the appropriate emotions.  The manner of voice in which an idea or speech is conveyed affects not only the emotions of the audience but, also, their ability to understand this concept.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Although Aristotle gives this mention and explanation of voice, he does not go into specifics about how to produce appropriate voice or how to convey specific tones with one's voice.  This may or may not be due to his mild disdain for the topic as a whole. Modern scholars have explored voice more extensively. According to Taylor Stoehr, "voice is the pervasive reflection in written or spoken language, of an author's character, the marks by which we recognize his utterance as his.".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Stoehr. "Tone and Voice."  ''College English'' Nov. 1968:  JSTOR. Pius XII Library, St. Louis, MO.  28 April 2008. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/374450]. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  However, just as in Aristotle's time set of specific rules or guidelines has yet been laid out for the production or interpretation of voice.  Due to the vast array of elements involved in the production of voice this task would be nearly, if not entirely, impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Stoehr 150&lt;/ref&gt;       

'''Language'''

As mentioned before, Aristotle thought the language of a speech should avoid being too lofty or too crude.  The speaker must use the ordinary language of everyday life.  However, because people best remember what is out of the ordinary, the speaker must use some language that gives the speech an air of importance.

The elevation of the language must correlate to the elevation of the subject or, in poetry, the character that is speaking.  In poetry, language and linguistic devices that convey a sense of importance are more appropriate, and should be used more often because the events of poetry are more removed from ordinary life.  They are less appropriate in rhetorical speech because the topics relate more directly to ordinary things and the people who are listening to the speech.  Most of all, the speaker must "give the impression of speaking naturally and not artificially." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; When one seems to speak with ease, the audience is more easily persuaded that the facts he is communicating are truthful. 

Also, a speaker must avoid using very many "strange words, compound words, and invented words.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle considered this kind of language an excessive departure from the way people normally speak.  However, one acceptable departure from plain language is the use of [[metaphor]] because metaphors are used by all people in everyday conversation.

== Two forms of lexis ==

According to Aristotle, lexis, meaning the delivery of words, is the least important area of speech when in comparison to invention, arrangement and style.  However, lexis is still closely looked at and broken down into two forms.  The two types of lexis in rhetoric include: ''lexis graphike'' and ''lexis agonistike'' &lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Sonkowsky, ”An Aspect of Delivery in Ancient Rhetorical Theory.” p. 259 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/view/283710?seq=4&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=agonistike&amp;term=graphike&amp;term=lexis&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dlexis%2Bgraphike%2Band%2Blexis%2Bagonistike%26dc%3DAll%2BDisciplines&amp;item=1&amp;ttl=1&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle&amp;cookieSet=1]&lt;/ref&gt; The separate terms that describe the two forms of lexis, graphike and agonistike, have been conformed by several Latin terms.  Although the words directly relate to the type of lexis, the theories of Aristotle and Plato do not compare.

''Lexis graphike'' comes from the term ''zographia'', meaning realistic painting, and graphe, meaning writing. Plato believes that writing and painting are one of the same.   His theory proves that both do not have the capability to defend themselves through an argument, question and answer, which conveys that these forms can not prove truth. Although for Aristotle, ''lexis graphik''e is the most accurate delivery of language, which leads to his theory that proves that writing does not need to be questioned because it is already exact.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 264&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Lexis agonistike'' however is from the term ''skiagraphia'', meaning a rough sketch or outline of painting.  Aristotle once again opposes Plato by believing that ''lexis agonistike'' does not need questions asked, but only answers.  The answer refers to the use of invention given to the actor because the writing portion is only outlined.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 265&lt;/ref&gt;

To further understand the separate types of lexis, each type can be broken down by how the writing is prepared and delivered.  ''Lexis graphike'' is the most precise style of rhetoric and strongly appeals to intelligence.  The delivery of ''lexis graphike'' is designed for a careful reading from either the book or paper as opposed to a performance that leaves room for improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; This type of lexis is a simple, straight forward recitation rather than an elaborate presentation.  ''Lexis graphike'' is most accurately written and depends the least upon the person who is delivering the speech.  ''Lexis agonistike'' contradicts ''lexis graphike'' because it is typically carelessly written and meant for a full performance.  The lack of attention given to the written words allows the performer to improvise. This gives the presentation a style that reflects the entertainer rather the writer.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Libby Fox''' (initially known as "'''Squiggle'''") is a fictional character from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]], ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Belinda Owusu]]. She made her first appearance on 22 May 2006 and left in 2010. She is the daughter of [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) and [[Owen Turner]] ([[Lee Ross]]), and half-sister of [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]). The Fox family were introduced by executive producer [[Kate Harwood]]. The character of Libby was featured in a prominent storyline in 2006, when Owen attempts to murder her. The character then cultivates a relationship with her peer [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]). She is portrayed as intelligent and competitive. The character was axed in April 2010 and her departure episode was broadcast on 5 August 2010. Libby returned in May 2014 for [[Lucy Beale]]'s ([[Hetti Bywater]]) funeral. Since then she continued to make various guest appearances up until 31 January 2017.

==Storylines==
===2006–2010===
Libby is [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]])'s second daughter. Libby secretly contacts her estranged father, [[Owen Turner]] ([[Lee Ross]]), an abusive alcoholic, and he starts making demands to see her. Denise is reluctant to allow this, but Owen seems to have changed, and Libby is keen for her parents to get back together; Denise is swayed and sleeps with Owen. However, as soon as Owen begins drinking again, he becomes abusive and hits her. He is arrested, but Libby persuades Denise to give a glowing character witness statement and he is released. Owen kidnaps Libby and takes her to [[Epping Forest]]. He drugs her and tries to kill her and himself by filling the car with noxious exhaust fumes. She escapes, but he catches her and tries to drown her in a stream. Denise arrives to find Libby unconscious on the bank. She is taken to hospital and makes a full recovery. Owen is imprisoned.

Libby gets involved in various scams with her friend [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]). She develops a crush on [[Gus Smith]] ([[Mohammed George]]), but is too young to be noticed by him, so she begins using an internet chat room, talking to a stranger named "Einstein27". She refuses to listen to [[Yolande Trueman]]'s ([[Angela Wynter]]) concerns about the dangers of meeting someone online and agrees to meet him in person. When she meets the stranger, she discovers that she was chatting to Darren all along. He admits to liking Libby. She is initially unimpressed, but after Yolande arranges a meal between them, they decide to start a relationship. A few weeks later Darren visits his family in the [[Cotswolds]], and Libby is heartbroken to discover he has decided not to return. She concentrates on her school work and achieves eleven good [[GCSE]] grades.

Darren returns some weeks later but Libby avoids him. When she finally plucks up the courage to see him, she hears him talking about someone called Clara. Thinking he has found someone new, she pretends she is going out with [[Tamwar Masood]] ([[Himesh Patel]]). It turns out Clara is a dog and the pair get back together. Libby and Darren have an anniversary dinner to celebrate a year of dating. However, [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]) reveals that Darren frequently looks at pornography. Libby becomes furious and confides in Tamwar with whom she is in the process of starting a home tutoring business. Darren becomes jealous, but eventually reconciles with Libby and begins thinking about starting a sexual relationship with Libby. He invites her round to do this, however Jay ruins the night by telling Libby that Darren told him that she was a virgin. Libby is devastated, but she eventually comes round and she and Darren decide not to rush things.

Libby achieves A grades in her [[GCE Advanced Level|AS Level]] exams, leading Denise to declare that she will be applying for [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. Libby worries her mother cannot afford to send her there. She later finds out she has conditionally been accepted at Oxford. Libby turns eighteen and Owen, who is still in prison, contacts her by sending her a [[birthday card]] and asking Libby's grandmother, [[Liz Turner]] ([[Kate Williams (actress)|Kate Williams]]), to arrange a meeting. At the same time, Libby decides it is the right time for her to lose her virginity with Darren. She then phones her grandmother and agrees to meet with her father. Chelsea returns for Libby's birthday and sees Liz in the Square. Libby is forced to reveal that she visited Owen and that he will be released in a matter of months. Denise visits him but then tells Libby he will not be returning to their lives. Libby discovers she will attend Oxford University when she gets the [[A Level]] grades she needs but decides against it, saying her mother needs her in Walford. She later changes her mind, and leaves for Oxford early in October. [[Adam Best (EastEnders)|Adam Best]] ([[David Proud]]), an Oxford student who has taken a liking to her, sends her a text message saying "See you in Oxford. X".

When Owen is released from prison, he returns to Walford to see Libby, although he is not supposed to. [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) discovers this and threatens to call the police, but instead he contacts Libby, who comes straight to Walford from Oxford to see her father. She overhears Darren booking a table for two in a restaurant and suspects he is meeting another woman. She turns up at the restaurant and finds Darren there with Owen. Darren says he wanted to ask Owen's permission to ask Libby to marry him. Libby accepts his proposal. When Lucas, Denise's boyfriend and Chelsea's father,  has Owen arrested for breaching his bail conditions, Libby at first doesn't believe Owen's claims but is shocked when Lucas confesses. Though angry with Lucas at first she eventually forgives him. Libby makes her dad promise to leave Denise and Lucas alone. The day before the wedding, Owen crashes Denise's hen night to warn her that Lucas killed his ex-wife [[Trina Johnson]] ([[Sharon Duncan Brewster]]) and she is in danger.

Both Denise and Libby are angry with Owen. Owen is heartbroken and prepared to leave until Chelsea tells him about the bracelet. Unknown to everyone but Lucas, Owen hides in Phil's Jaguar and confronts Lucas about his crime, leading to Lucas strangling him to death and burying him in the gardens in Albert Square. Libby feels a bit guilty about parting on bad terms with her father but Liz reassures her. Darren receives a card from [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]), which Libby opens and finds cash inside. Libby asks him about it and he says before Christmas he found Heather crying because she could not afford to buy any presents for her baby son [[George Trott|George]] (Joshua Jacobs) and he felt sorry for her. Libby calls him a softie, but later overhears Heather and her friend [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) discussing Darren and the paternity of the baby. Libby reveals that Darren is George's father in front of everyone at [[Syed Masood]] ([[Marc Elliott]]) and [[Amira Shah]]'s ([[Preeya Kalidas]]) wedding.

Darren tries to speak to Libby but Chelsea will not let him in. He continues to bang on the door while Denise tells Libby that she could go back to Oxford early and it is time to move on. Libby eventually talks to Darren, who explains why he slept with Heather and what happened between them. Libby then talks to Heather who says it was her fault it happened and she did not say anything as she did not want to hurt Libby. Libby then decides to leave and Darren stops her at the tube station and tells her how much he loves her, but she goes anyway. She returns from Oxford and tells her family she is now dating Adam, though Adam tells Darren that Libby she makes up for her lack of good looks by being good in bed. On hearing that Owen has supposedly sent flowers to Liz, Libby wonders why he won't get in touch with her. She steals some CCTV footage from the florists and is shocked to see Lucas ordering a huge bunch of lilies. Lucas explains to Libby that he sent Liz the flowers to buy Owen time because he is drinking again. Libby accepts this and hugs Lucas.

Libby goes back to university but returns when she learns that Jordan is in a [[coma]]. She hears [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Charlie Jones (actor)|Charlie Jones]]) confess in the middle of the cafe that he hit Jordan with a spanner and tells Lucas this. Lucas locks himself in the community centre and breaks down, blaming Jordan's condition on his own actions. Libby is worried about Lucas's state of mind and tries to coax him to come out. When she threatens to call the police, Lucas finally unlocks the doors. Lucas goes to the hospital and finds Jordan has been awoken from his coma and is safe. Libby tells Chelsea and Denise about Lucas's breakdown. Chelsea accuses her of making a mountain out of a molehill, Denise however listens intently.

Libby is devastated to learn that a body discovered buried in the Square is that of her father. After speaking to Liz, Libby disowns her as she called the police to say she thought Denise was capable of murdering Owen, and she was taken away for questioning. When Adam brings Libby flowers and says Owen must have been murdered for a reason, Libby shouts at him for patronizing her. Chelsea tells Libby that Lucas found Trina's bracelet in Denise's bag after she died, leading them to believe that Denise may have killed both Trina and Owen. They see Denise driving away from the Square alone, and receive a text message from her saying "I'm sorry". In reality, Lucas had killed Owen and confessed to Denise, taken her to a canal and strangled her, sending the text message before throwing the phone in the canal. Libby is the only person who believes that there is no way Denise could have done this and says that "sorry" could mean anything. However, the police tell the family that Denise's car has been found by the canal, before a body is pulled from the water. Libby vows to carry on as normal, but says that this is not like Denise. The police arrive and say they have found a body in the canal along with Denise's mobile. Libby and Patrick comfort each other while Lucas and Chelsea go to the mortuary, where Lucas identifies the body as Denise.

Libby discovers that Adam has been blackmailing [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Melissa Suffield]]) for sex, and dumps him after slapping him across the face, leading to him leaving Walford. She feels let down by Patrick when he does not write a eulogy for Denise, and then asks the family to leave after Denise's funeral, however, Lucas convinces him to change his mind. On the day of Denise's funeral, Libby again questions who she was. Libby is happy when Patrick gives a eulogy to Denise, but is upset when an argument starts between Liz and Denises's sisters [[Kim Fox|Kim]] ([[Tameka Empson]]) and [[Daphne Fox|Daphne]] (Emi Wokoma). Patrick reveals that the girls can continue to stay with him and Chelsea and Libby agree to start packing up Denise's belongings. While celebrating Libby's birthday, Denise walks in, revealing that she is not dead but that Lucas has been keeping her prisoner, and that he was the one who killed Trina and Owen. Lucas enters and confirms this, and takes the family hostage, but when Jordan arrives, they escape and Lucas is arrested. Denise is taken to hospital, and Libby has to go through the pain of attending her father's funeral. Chelsea then decides she wants to move to Spain with Liz, so Libby arranges to take time off from university to help with her mother at home. Denise disapproves of this, and arranges for Libby to go to Spain for a holiday with Chelsea and her grandmother, before returning permanently to Oxford. After tearfully saying goodbye to her family, the taxi is stopped by Darren who is upset that Libby is leaving without saying goodbye to him. Libby says that she has always loved him and that he will always be her best friend, before she leaves Walford. Darren moves away from Walford in 2011, following his break-up with [[Jodie Gold]] ([[Kylie Babbington]]) and opts to stay with Libby in Oxford. A few months later, Jodie also moves to Oxford to be with Darren.

===2014–2017===

Denise visits Libby at Oxford and she is concerned, as Denise does not like talking about her home life. Later on, Libby calmly confronts Denise, who reveals to a stunned Libby that she does not want to marry her fiancé, [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). Denise later rings Libby, telling her that she will end her relationship with Ian the following day. However, Ian's daughter and Libby's old friend, Lucy (now [[Hetti Bywater]]), dies in mysterious circumstances (see [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]) that night and after hearing about her death, Libby sends her condolences to Ian, via a text message to Denise. Libby returns to Walford a few weeks later, in order to attend Lucy's funeral. She is unhappy when she witnesses how Ian treats Denise and urges her mother to call things off with him. After staying the night at Patrick's, Libby asks Denise to go to Spain, with her for Chelsea's birthday. Denise is unsure, but Ian encourages her to go, admitting that he has taken her for granted. Denise and Libby then depart in a taxi.

Libby returns for her 24th birthday to find Denise arguing with [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]) over the preparation of food for the party. Libby opens her presents then receives a secret phone call from Chelsea, and she promises to tell Denise something when she finds the right time. However, Libby cannot bring herself to tell Denise and later calls Chelsea to tell her this. Libby then leaves and returns to Oxford. She returns again in December 2015 for the housewarming party of Kim and her husband [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]), where she reveals to Denise about how troublesome Jordan has become and how he caused trouble for her and Chelsea in Spain.

Libby returns again for Mother's Day and goes for a family dinner, where later she finds a note Denise put there saying that Lucas plans to escape prison. Libby leaves and tells Masood, who advises her to call the police and he helps her get into Denise's house, which has been locked by Jordan (now [[Joivan Wade]]), who is helping Lucas escape. Libby witnesses Jordan raging at Denise and reveals that she has reported him to the police. Jordan becomes angry with Denise and Libby and is arrested. Libby then returns to Oxford after saying goodbye to Denise and Patrick.

In April 2016, Libby returns upset, and tells Denise she is pregnant. Denise is overjoyed but Libby says she is having an abortion and has already taken the first of two abortion pills. Denise is against this and she gets very drunk, with only Kim supporting Libby's decision. The following day, as Libby returns to the abortion clinic to terminate her pregnancy, a hungover Denise arrives to support her alongside Kim. She then thanks Denise for being a good mother to her before leaving again. Libby returns in November after Kim calls her and is shocked to see that Denise is seven months pregnant. She vows to remain in Walford and help Denise with the birth. Denise is frustrated when Libby insists that Denise should eat only vegan food. After Denise is suspended from her job, Libby helps her get it back by threatening legal action. However, Denise tells Libby that she should not be sacrificing her life in Oxford for her, so after sharing an emotional farewell with Denise, Libby departs. Libby returns with Kim and her grandmother, [[Emerald Fox]] ([[Doña Croll]]), for the birth of her half-brother. Libby is shocked when she learns Denise is having her son adopted, but respects her decision.

In September 2018, it is mentioned that Libby is the only student from Walford High to ever attend [[Oxbridge]].

==Creation and development==
Early in Spring 2006, an official BBC press report announced the introduction of a new, all female family joining ''EastEnders'', Denise Fox ([[Diane Parish]]) and her two daughters Chelsea ([[Tiana Benjamin]]) and Libby (nicknamed Squiggle), cast to [[Belinda Owusu]], who was 16 at the time. Benjamin has revealed that she was the second Fox to be cast, and on her final audition, she had a workshop and met Diane Parish there. Owusu was cast at a later date.&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/cast/interviews/interview_content/interview_tiana_b.shtml|title=Tiana Benjamin Interview|publisher=''BBC''| date = 18 September 2006| accessdate=26 July 2008}}{{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiana Benjamin who plays Chelsea has said that the three actors who play the Fox family have a bond,  commenting "We all respect and understand each other, and manage to have a good time while we're filming too. I felt that we clicked from our first few scenes together."&lt;ref name="int"/&gt;

Described as "the feisty Fox family", the characters first appeared on-screen in May 2006. An insider reportedly said to the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'', "They'll arrive in Albert Square with a bang and they'll cause friction from the off. The Fox girls don't take any nonsense -they'll be a force to be reckoned with." The newspaper described the character of Libby as a superbrat and teenage troublemaker. Owusu commented, "Squiggle is going to cause lots of mischief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20060312/ai_n16151115?tag=content;col1|title=New foxy family hit Walford|publisher=''BBC''| date = 12 March 2006| accessdate=14 October 2008|first=Lara|last=Gould}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 it was announced that the character had been axed along with five others by the new executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] as part of a plan to "breathe new life into the show".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/2936236/Six-members-of-the-EastEnders-cast-are-to-be-culled.html|title=Dead Enders|date=17 April 2010|publisher=[[News International]]|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|first=Colin|last=Robertson|accessdate=17 April 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of her departure, Owusu said: "I've had a great time playing Libby but I agree with Bryan that after four years of great storylines, it is now time for Libby to move on. ''EastEnders'' was my first real job and I have learnt so much but I am now really looking forward to trying new roles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a214903/six-characters-to-leave-eastenders.html|title=Six characters to leave 'EastEnders'|last=Green|first=Kris|date=17 April 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her final episode was broadcast on 5 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a239089/peggy-takes-louise-to-see-lisa.html|title=Peggy takes Louise to see Lisa|last=Green|first=Kris|author2=Kilkelly, Daniel |date=July 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=27 July 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, it was announced that Owusu had agreed to reprise the role of Libby Fox for number of episodes from April 2014, as part of the "[[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]" storyline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soapsquawk.co.uk/news/eastenders-spoiler-libby-fox-makes-a-return.php#results EastEnders spoiler, Libby Fox makes a return&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722033740/http://www.soapsquawk.co.uk/news/eastenders-spoiler-libby-fox-makes-a-return.php#results |date=22 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her on-screen return on 18 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0419nkw BBC One - EastEnders, 18/04/2014&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105191946/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0419nkw |date=5 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was again announced in July 2015 that Libby would return again for a two episode guest stint.

== Reception ==
In 2008, it was reported that Cambridge University wanted to shed its "elitist" image. Cambridge University allegedly approached the producers of Britain's three leading soaps, ''EastEnders'', ''[[Coronation Street]]'' and ''[[Emmerdale]]'', asking them to include the university in their storylines.&lt;ref name="uni"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080905071828/http://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2008-09-02-cambridge_N.htm Cambridge University wants to be on soaps, shed elitist image]", ''USA Today'', URL last accessed 10 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Spokesman Greg Hayman said the idea was part of a bid to correct the perception that Cambridge was "not for young people from ordinary backgrounds." He added, "We're very keen to attract the brightest and best students regardless of their background. One of the better ways of communicating directly with potential students is to talk to them through the soaps and other programs they watch."&lt;ref name="uni"/&gt; This move followed government pressure for the university to become more inclusive and to target all economic backgrounds. 90% of British students attend [[State school|state secondary schools]]; Oxford and a Cambridge Universities draw about half their student body from state schools. It was reported that working-class individuals view attending Oxford or Cambridge as an impossible dream, which university officials claim is unfair and they are hoping to dispel this by featuring the Universities in working-class soaps such as ''EastEnders''. Hayman said there have been no firm commitments from TV producers, although one crew was planning an exploratory visit to Cambridge; however, he stated that he was happy with the plot running in ''EastEnders'' that showed "working-class teenagers Tamwar Masood and Libby Fox considering applying to Cambridge and Oxford, to the delight of their ambitious mothers", saying that "It's a very happy coincidence."&lt;ref name="uni"/&gt; Oxford University said it had no plans to write to the soaps for inclusion but a spokesperson claimed, "I did speak to somebody at ''EastEnders'' about our bursary scheme in case the storyline was going to continue. We wanted to make sure they knew what kind of assistance might be available to someone like Libby." ''EastEnders'' refused to comment on whether the universities would be featured at the time, as Tamwar and Libby still had another year left at college "and it was too early to say whether the Oxford-Cambridge plot would continue."&lt;ref name="uni"/&gt;

Reporting on the University storyline, ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that Libby and Tamwar applying to Oxford and Cambridge could be the universities' "dream storyline", as it showed that "clever state school kids can get a place." However, the reporter added that "it could also be their worst nightmare. Young Libby is already revealing concerns that she might not be able to afford to go to the university." The paper alleged that both universities' press offices "fired off letters to the script editors: did they know about the generous bursaries and seemingly bottomless pit of cash available to help students from low-income homes stay on their courses? Could that be mentioned?".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2008/sep/02/highereducation.cambridgeuniversity Which soap stars would you send to Oxbridge?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306021931/https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2008/sep/02/highereducation.cambridgeuniversity |date=March 6, 2016 }}", ''The Guardian'', URL last accessed 10 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off''''' is a 1987 play by [[Liz Lochhead]]. It explores the relationship between [[Elizabeth I of England]] and [[Mary Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]]. It is primarily written to be from a female point of view, and is considered to be Lochhead's most successful and critically acclaimed play.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/arts/writingscotland/learning_journeys/women_writers/liz_lochhead/works.shtml |title= Writing Scotland - Liz Lochhead |publisher=BBC |work=BBC Two |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] website:

:''"[ Lochhead ] has the character of Elizabeth enact masculine types of behaviour (even appearing on stage in men’s clothes) as a means of representing the exclusion of feminine behaviour in the political realm. Mary, by contrast, wields a more conventionally feminine power, exploiting her sexuality and the emotional vulnerability associated with her sex in order to get her own way.''"&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

It was first performed by the Communicado Theatre Company at the 1987 [[Edinburgh Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=British Council |url=http://literature.britishcouncil.org/liz-lochhead |title=Liz Lochhead &amp;#124; British Council Literature |publisher=Literature.britishcouncil.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marilyn Imrie#Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off|Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off]] was broadcast as a [[radio play]] directed by [[Marilyn Imrie]] by [[BBC Radio 4]] on 11 February 2001. 

The [[National Theatre of Scotland]] toured a new production of the play across Scotland in 2009, directed by [[Alison Peebles]] who played Elizabeth in the original production.

The term mordant comes from the Latin ''mordere'', "to bite". In the past, it was thought that a mordant helped the dye bite onto the fiber so that it would hold fast during washing.  A mordant is often a [[valence (chemistry)|polyvalent]] [[metal]] [[ion]], often chromium(III).&lt;ref name="Stainsfile - How Stains Work"&gt;{{Cite news |url=//stainsfile.info/StainsFile/theory/mordant.htm |title=Stain Theory – How mordants work |last=Llewellyn |first=Bryan D. |date=May 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814015208/http://stainsfile.info/StainsFile/theory/mordant.htm |archivedate=August 14, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting coordination complex of dye and ion is [[colloidal]] and can be either [[acid]]ic or [[base (chemistry)|alkaline]].

==Common dye mordants==
Mordants include [[tannic acid]], [[alum]], [[chrome alum]], [[sodium chloride]], and certain [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s of [[aluminium]], [[chromium]], [[copper]], [[iron]], [[iodine]], [[potassium]], [[sodium]], [[tungsten]], and [[tin]]. KAl(SO4)2 12 H2O

Iodine is often referred to as a mordant in [[Gram staining|Gram stains]], but is in fact a trapping agent.&lt;ref name="Stainsfile - How Stains Work"/&gt;

==Dyeing methods==
[[File:Dye rot.jpg|thumb|Dye rot from iron mordant]]
The three methods used for mordanting are:
* Pre-mordanting (onchrome): The substrate is treated with the mordant and then the dye.  The complex between the mordant and dye is formed on the fibre.
* Meta-mordanting (metachrome): The mordant is added in the dye bath itself.  The process is simpler than pre- or post-mordanting, but is applicable to only a few dyes.  Mordant red 19 shown above is applied in this manner
* Post-mordanting (afterchrome): The dyed material is treated with a mordant.  The complex between the mordant and dye is formed on the fibre.

The type of mordant used affects the [[Tints and shades|shade]] obtained after dyeing and also affects the fastness property of the dye.  The application of mordant, either pre-mordant, meta-mordant or post-mordant methods, is influenced by:

* The action of the mordant on the substrate: if the mordant and dye methods are harsh (for example, an acidic mordant with an acidic dye), pre-mordanting or post-mordanting limits the potential for damage to the substrate.
* The stability of the mordant or dye lake or both: the formation of a stable dye lake means that the mordant can be added in the dye without risk of losing the dye properties (meta-mordanting).

Dye results can also rely on the mordant chosen as the introduction of the mordant into the dye will have a marked effect on the final color. Each dye can have different reactions to each mordant. For example, [[cochineal]] scarlet, or Dutch scarlet as it came to be known, used cochineal along with a tin mordant to create a brilliant orange-hued red.&lt;ref&gt;Phipps, Elena (2010). ''Cochineal Red The Art History of a Color'', p34. Yale University Press, New Haven and London. {{ISBN|978-0-300-15513-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Residual iron mordant can damage or fade fabric, producing "dye rot".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quilthistory.com/cleaning.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The dye lake===
The [[Lake pigment|dye lake]] is an insoluble complex formed upon combining the dye and mordant, which then attaches to the substrate. Mordants increase the fastness of the dye since the higher molecular weight dye is now bonded to the fibre.&lt;ref name="Stainsfile - How Stains Work"/&gt;

The type of mordant used can change the colour of both the dye-plus-mordant solution and influence the shade of the final product.

===Wool===
Unlike cotton, [[wool]] is highly receptive toward mordants. Due to its [[amphoteric]] nature wool can absorb acids and bases with equal efficiency. When wool is treated with a metallic salt it [[hydrolyse]]s the salt into an acidic and basic component. The basic component is absorbed at –COOH group and the acidic component is removed during washing. Wool also has a tendency to absorb fine precipitates from solutions; these cling to the surface of fibres and dye particles attached to these contaminants result in poor rubbing fastness.
[[File:Congo-red-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|322px|The discovery of [[Congo red]] in 1883, followed by many other synthetic azo dyes, heralded the demise of mordant dyes.]]

===Silk===
Like wool, [[silk]] is also amphoteric and can absorb both acids and bases. However, wool has [[Thio-|thio]] groups (-SH) from the [[cystine]] [[amino acid]], which act as reducing agent and can reduce [[hexavalent]] chromium of [[potassium dichromate]] to [[trivalent]] form. The trivalent chromium forms the complex with the fibre and dye. Therefore, potassium dichromate cannot be used effectively as mordant.

===Animal and plant tissues===
In [[histology]], mordants are indispensable in fixing dyes to tissues for [[Microscopy|microscopic examination]].

Methods for mordant application depend on the desired stain and tissues under study; pre-, meta- and post-mordanting techniques are used as required.

The most commonly used stain used in diagnostic histology of animal tissues is Harris' [[haematoxylin]] as part of a haematoxylin and eosin [[H&amp;E stain|(H&amp;E)]] stain.

[[File:Museum Of The Moon Installation - Victoria Memorial Hall - Kolkata 2018-02-17 1340.JPG|thumb|''Museum of the Moon'', exhibited in Kolkata in 2018]]
'''''Museum of the Moon''''' is a 2016 inflatable [[installation art]]work by [[Luke Jerram]].  It is a spherical replica of the [[Moon]], with a diameter of {{convert|7|m|ft}}. Several copies tour the world for temporary exhibitions, often accompanied by music.  There are also copies in museums in Barcelona and Sydney.

Jerram noted the wide tidal range when living in Bristol and was inspired to create an artwork of the Moon.  The [[helium balloon]] was made by [[Cameron Balloons]], initially funded by the [[UK Association of Science and Discovery Centres]] and the [[UK Space Agency]], using [[ripstop]] material coated with [[urethane]].   The surface of the sphere is decorated with 120[[dpi]] printed imagery of the Moon's surface from [[NASA]]'s [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]], stitched together by the  [[Astrogeology Research Program|Astrogeology Science Centre]] of the [[United States Geological Survey]], at a scale of about 1:500,000, or {{convert|1|cm|in}} to {{convert|5|km|mi}}.  When installed in a dark place, the sphere is lit internally to create a glowing floating orb.  Although the surface of the balloon is smooth, the fine detail of the imagery gives the impression that it is textured.

After six months of work, the artwork was first exhibited at the [[Bristol International Balloon Fiesta]] in June 2016, but high winds caused it to burst within a few minutes.  It was quickly repaired and the original balloon and its reproductions have been exhibited many times since.  In 2018, Jerram completed a similar {{convert|7|m}} spherical artwork of the Earth viewed from space, at a scale of {{convert|1|cm|in}} to {{convert|18|km|mi}}.

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Paraphrasing of copyrighted material''' may reduce the probability that a court will find that [[copyright]] has been infringed; however, there have been many cases where a [[paraphrase]] that uses quite different words and sentence structure has been found to infringe on a prior work's copyright.

The acceptable degree of difference between a prior work and a paraphrase depends on a variety of factors and ultimately depends on the judgement of the court in each individual case.

==Legal traditions==

===Early years===
[[File:Zedler - Universal-Lexicon, Band 1 (Titelblatt).jpg|thumb|[[Johann Heinrich Zedler]]'s right to publish his ''[[Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon|Universal-Lexicon]]'' was challenged on the grounds that an encyclopedia must always paraphrase other works.]]
An early example of the concept of paraphrasing as a copyright issue arose with [[Johann Heinrich Zedler]]'s application in 1730 for copyright protection in Saxony for his ''[[Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon]]'', one of the first encyclopedias. 
The publisher of a rival ''General Historical Lexicon'' said that Zedler's ''Universal Lexicon'' would not differ in content from this and other existing lexicons apart from paraphrasing.{{sfn|Kirchhoff|1891|pp=198}}
On 16 October 1730, the Upper Consistory court in [[Dresden]] rejected Zedler's request, and warned that he would be subject to confiscation and a fine if he reproduced any material from the ''General Historical Lexicon'' in his ''Universal Lexicon''.{{sfn|Order against Zedler}}

Laws on the degree of copying or paraphrasing that is considered permissible have become steadily more restrictive over the years.
In his 2008 book ''Copyright's Paradox'', discussing the conflict between protecting copyright and protecting free speech,  Neil Netanel says, "Yeats [borrowed] from Shelley; Kafka from Kleist and Dickens; Joyce from Homer; and T.S. Eliot from Shakespeare, Whitman and Baudelaire, all in ways that would infringe today's bloated copyright."{{sfn|Saint-Amour|2011|p=31}}
Paraphrase may apply to music as well as to writing. It was commonplace for Baroque, Classical and Romantic composers to create variations on each other's work without permission.  This would not be allowed today.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=100}}

Copyright protection in Britain dates back to the 1556 Charter of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers]].
The [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]] gave publishers exclusive printing rights, but did not give any rights to authors.
Parliament failed to renew the act in 1694, primarily to remove monopoly and encourage a free press.
The [[Statute of Anne]] in 1710 prescribed a copyright term of fourteen years, and let the author renew for another fourteen years, after which the work went into the [[public domain]].
Over the years, additional acts and case law steadily refined the definitions of what could be protected, including derivative works, and the degree of protection given.{{sfn|Patterson|1993|pp=9ff}}

The Soviet Union's Copyright Act of 1925 in essence said that a work created by a minimal paraphrase of an existing text could be considered a new work eligible for copyright.{{sfn|Levitsky|1964|p=101}}
By 1991, the [[Copyright law of the Soviet Union]] had evolved to give much more protection to the author.
Free use, similar to the English [[common law]] concept of [[fair use]], was only allowed if it did not infringe upon the normal exploitation of the work or the legitimate interests of the author.{{sfn|Elst|2005|p=376}}

===Moral rights===

[[Moral rights (copyright law)|Moral rights]] are rights of creators of copyrighted works that are generally recognized in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, in some [[common law]] jurisdictions. 
They include the right of [[attribution (copyright)|attribution]] and the right to the integrity of the work, which bars the work from alteration, distortion, or mutilation without the author's permission.  Paraphrasing without permission may be seen as violating moral rights. 
Moral rights are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights. 
Even if the author has assigned their copyright to a third party, they still maintain the moral rights to the work.{{sfn|Rajan|2006|p=41-42}}
Moral rights were first recognized in [[France]] and [[Germany]].{{sfn|Rigamonti|2006|p=355}}
They were included in the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in 1928.{{sfn|Kwall|2010|p=37}}
While the [[United States]] became a signatory to the Berne convention in 1989, it does not completely recognize moral rights as part of [[copyright law]], which is seen as protecting commercial rights in intellectual property, but as part of other bodies of law such as defamation or unfair competition which protect the reputation of the author.{{sfn|Kwall|2010|pp=30ff}}
[[File:Edward Gibbon by Henry Walton cleaned.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Gibbon]] was more concerned about poor translations of his book than about copyright violations.]]
[[Edward Gibbon]] published the last three volumes of his masterpiece ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' in 1788, at a time when both copyright and moral rights were poorly enforced.
With a small private income, he was not dependent on sales but was more concerned about the damage to his reputation from poor translations, a form of paraphrasing.
He wrote, "The French, Italian and German translations have been executed with various success; but instead of patronizing, I should willingly suppress such imperfect copes which injure the character while they propagate the name of the author.  The Irish pirates are at once my friends and my enemies...."{{sfn|Gibbon|2006|p=171}}

By the start of the twentieth century, U.S. decisions on unfair competition found that representing as the author's work a version of the work that substantially departed from the original was a cause of action.{{sfn|Winn|2006|pp=126-127}}
Section §43(a) of the [[Lanham Act]], which protects brands and trademarks, also provides similar protection to laws based on moral rights.
For any goods or services, it bans false designation of origin or a false description or representation.{{sfn|Kwall|2010|p=30}}
In ''[[Gilliam v. American Broadcasting]]'' the British comedy group called ''[[Monty Python]]'' took action against the ABC network for broadcasting versions of their programs which had been correctly attributed to them but had been extensively edited, in part to remove content that their audience might consider offensive or obscene. 
The judgement of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] was in favor of ''Monty Python'', finding the cuts might be an "actionable mutilation" that violated the Lanham Act.{{sfn|Lumbard|1976}}

===Fair use===

In the United States, copyright was covered by common law until it was formalized in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]].
Section §107 of this act set out four "[[fair use]]" principles to be used in evaluating whether copyright had been infringed:
*the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
*the nature of the copyrighted work;
*the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
*the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

These principles apply both to literal copies and to paraphrases.
Judges are required to consider these factors, but may also take others into consideration, and may choose what weight they apply to each factor.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=162ff}}
According to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in ''[[Wainwright Securities v. Wall Street Transcript Corp]]'' (1977), "The fair use doctrine offers a means of balancing the exclusive rights of a copyright holder with the public's interest in dissemination of information affecting areas of universal concern, such as art, science and industry."{{sfn|Burleson Enterprises|2011}}
Claims of fair use in copying or paraphrasing are more likely to succeed when the work being copied is factual.  
In ''[[Harper &amp; Row v. Nation Enterprises]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] said, "the law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy."{{sfn|Perle|Fischer|Williams|1999|p=13-30}}
However, the court went on to quote Gorman, ''Fact or Fancy? The Implications for Copyright'' (1982) which said, "[E]ven within the field of fact works, there are gradations as to the relative proportion of fact and fancy. One may move from sparsely embellished maps and directories to elegantly written biography. The extent to which one must permit expressive language to be copied, in order to assure dissemination of the underlying facts, will thus vary from case to case."{{sfn|O'Connor|1985}}

[[File:Gerald Ford hearing.jpg|thumb|President [[Gerald Ford]] at the hearing on pardoning former President [[Richard Nixon]]. When ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine published excerpts of Ford's unpublished memoir describing his reason for pardoning Nixon, the Supreme Court ruled that copyright was infringed even though Ford was a public figure describing a public event.]]
Use of a work for critical commentary is generally considered fair, as long as the commentary is indeed about the substance or style of the original work.{{sfn|Port|Halpern|Nard|2011|p=132}}
Parody may be seen as a form of commentary, and to be effective must copy or paraphrase many of the elements of creative expression in the work being parodied.
Although courts have differed in the past about how closely a parody can copy an original work, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'' (1994) ruled strongly: "[P]arody has an obvious claim to [[Transformativeness|transformative]] value... Like less ostensibly humorous forms of criticism, it can provide social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and in the process, creating a new one.  We thus line up with the courts that have held the parody, like other comment or criticism, may claim fair use under §107."{{sfn|Port|Halpern|Nard|2011|p=130–131}}

===Unpublished works===

Unpublished works have special status under both moral rights and copyright, since the author or copyright owner has the right to control first publication.
Publication of an excerpt or paraphrase of an unpublished work may infringe that right.
An author wishing to quote or even loosely paraphrase an unpublished work in France can only do so with permission from the author.{{sfn|Heins|Beckles|2005|p=17}}
In ''Harper &amp; Row v. Nation Enterprises'' (1985) the United States Supreme Court held that "under ordinary circumstances, the author's right to control the first public appearance of his undisseminated expression will outweigh a claim of fair use."{{sfn|Harper &amp; Row 1985}}

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]'', which concerned a biography in which a number of unpublished letters by the subject had been paraphrased, similarly concluded that the copyright owner's right to control publication took precedence over "fair use", so even limited paraphrasing was unacceptable.{{sfn|SALINGER v. RANDOM HOUSE, INC 1987}}
This drew support from those concerned with the rights of an individual to privacy and criticism from those more interested in the public "right to know."{{sfn|McDowell|1987}}
In 1992 the Copyright Act was amended as a result of the ''Salinger'' case to include a sentence at the end of §107 saying that the fact that a work is unpublished "shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration" of all four fair-use factors.{{sfn|Perle|Fischer|Williams|1999|p=13-7}}

==Comparison approaches==

A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words.  Equivalent concepts apply to images or music.
In most countries, copyright applies to the original expression in a work rather than to the meanings or ideas being expressed.
A loose paraphrase of a portion of a work may therefore be published without violating copyright.{{sfn|Head|2006|p=243}}
If the paraphrase is so different that the expression in the derivative work has no similarity to that of the prior work, there is no infringement.{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=284}} 
In ''[[See v. Durang]]'' (1983) the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] found "Copying deleted or so disguised as to be unrecognizable is not copying."{{sfn|Browning|Choy|Ferguson|1983}}
But courts have struggled to find a clear method of comparing a paraphrase or derivative to a prior work to determine whether the copyright in the original expression has been infringed.

[[File:LearnedHand1910a.jpg|thumb|Judge [[Learned Hand]] gave a seminal description of the [[idea/expression dichotomy]] in his 1930 judgement on ''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation]]''.]]
Philosophically, there is disagreement about the distinction between thought and language.
In the past it was often thought that the two could not be separated, and so a paraphrase could never exactly reproduce a thought expressed in different words.  
At the opposite extreme is the view that concepts and language are completely independent, so there is always a range of ways in which a concept can be expressed.{{sfn|Bently|Davis|Ginsburg|2010|p=190}}
Copyright law in common law countries tries to avoid theoretical discussion of the nature of ideas and expression such as this, taking a more pragmatic view of what is called the [[idea/expression dichotomy]].{{sfn|Bently|Davis|Ginsburg|2010|p=191-192}}
In ''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation]]'' (1930), Judge [[Learned Hand]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] gave an explanation of the dichotomy that has often been cited by courts hearing copyright cases, and that illustrates the inherent subjectivity of any decision.{{sfn|Rooijen|2010|p=62-63}}
He said:
{{blockquote|Upon any work, and especially upon a play, a great number of patterns of increasing generality will fit equally well, as more and more of the incident is left out.  The last may perhaps be no more than the most general statement of what the play is about, and at times might consist only of its title; but there is a point in this series of abstractions where they are no longer protected, since otherwise the playwright could prevent the use of his "ideas," to which, apart from their expression, his property is never extended ... Nobody has ever been able to fix that boundary, and nobody ever can.{{sfn|Hand|1930}}}}

The plaintiff in a copyright case must show that there is "[[substantial similarity]]" between the alleged copy and the prior work.{{sfn|Sneed|1985}} 
In ''[[Roth Greeting Cards v. United Card Co]]'' (1970) the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit introduced the concept of "total concept and feel", holding that a work could be made up of elements that could not be copyrighted, but that the total concept and feel could be subject to copyright, and would be considered to be infringed if a normal reasonable person would consider that a disputed work was a copy of a prior work.{{sfn|Hamley|1970}}
This concept has been used in later cases such as ''[[Reyher v. Children's Television Workshop]]'' (1976), where two works derived from the same folk tale had similar plots.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that there had not been copying, since the different versions were very different in style and in detail, saying "the essence of infringement lies in taking not a general theme but its particular expression through similarities of treatment, details, scenes, events and characterization."{{sfn|Meskill|1976}}

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in ''[[Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.]]'' (1977) refined the concept by establishing a two-stage comparison.
An extrinsic test would determine similarity of general ideas, while an intrinsic test would compare the particular expressions used.
Extrinsic similarity means that two works are substantially similar in their general ideas, which can be determined objectively by an expert.
Intrinsic similarity means they are substantially similar in their forms of expression, and this is the more subjective test.{{sfn|Sneed|1985}}
The second test should be made by an "ordinary reasonable person" rather than an expert.{{sfn|Nimmer|2008|p=509}}
Both must be true for an infringement to exist.{{sfn|Sneed|1985}}

==Sample court findings==

The ideas or facts in a work are not subject to copyright protection, but the "protected expression" is.
A paraphrase of a work may infringe on copyright if the "protected expression" in the paraphrase is similar to that in the prior work.
Many court cases have hinged on how "protected expression" is defined and how similarity is determined.
[[File:H. T. Marshall and Martin Thomas Manton in 1915 at the Becker-Rosenthal trial in New York City.jpg|thumb|300px|In ''[[Nutt v. National Institute Inc.]]'' (1929), Judge [[Martin Thomas Manton]] ''(pictured, right)'' ruled that even loose paraphrasing may infringe copyright.]]
One of the earliest cases was ''[[Baker v. Selden]]'' (1879).  Charles Selden had developed a new system of bookkeeping and in 1865 published a short book that described his system, with sample forms.  W.C.M. Baker, who had seen Selden's book, published a similar book in 1867 describing an improved version of the system. A suit claiming copyright infringement went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1879.{{sfn|Samuelson|2005|p=2ff}} 
The Supreme court found that Selden's idea could not be protected since there was no patent, but his description or explanation of the system was protected by copyright law, and found that Baker's book was "in large and material part identical with and infringements of the books of Selden system."
The arguments and ruling differ from modern law in that there was no discussion of the expression, only of the close similarities in the ideas given in the two books.{{sfn|Samuelson|2005|p=18ff}}

In ''[[Nutt v. National Institute Inc.]]'' (1929), Nutt was prohibited from delivering in public and for profit lectures that were similar to lectures whose copyright was held by the National Institute for the Improvement of Memory.{{sfn|Standler|2009|p=13}}
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in this case found that the protected expression is more than the literal words but also includes the "association, presentation, and combination of the ideas and thought which go to make up the [author's] literary composition."{{sfn|American Law Book Company|1939|p=233}}
The court said "The infringement need not be a complete or exact copy. Paraphrasing or copying with evasion is an infringement, even though there may be little or no conceivable identity between the two."{{sfn|Manton|1929}}

Wainwright Securities was engaged in preparing in-depth analyses of public companies, and selling them to major investors. The Wall Street Transcript Corporation, publisher of the ''Transcript'' magazine, began to publish abstracts of the Wainwright reports.
In ''Wainwright Securities v. Wall Street Transcript Corp'' (1977) the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit noted that "news events" cannot be copyrighted, but found that "the Transcript appropriated almost verbatim the most creative and original aspects of the reports, the financial analyses and predictions."
The court said, "What is protected is the manner of expression, the author's analysis or interpretation of events, the way he structures his material and marshals facts, his choice of words and the emphasis he gives to particular developments."{{sfn|Mishler|1977}}
An example of very close paraphrasing in this case was:
:*Original: "And second, he says that likely to aid comparisons this year was the surprisingly limited extent to which Fiber Divisions losses shrank last year."
:*Paraphrase: "The second development likely to aid comparisons this year was the surprisingly limited extent to which the Fiber Division's losses shrank last year."{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=285}} 
[[File:Richard Wright (escritor).jpg|thumb|In ''Wright v. Warner Books'' (1991) the court found that use of paraphrases and sparing excerpts from unpublished work by [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] ''(pictured)'' was fair.]]
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]'' (1987) found that an unauthorized biography by [[Ian Hamilton (critic)|Ian Hamilton]] had infringed copyright with paraphrases of passages from unpublished letters written by the subject, the well-known novelist [[J. D. Salinger]]. As an example, the court cited:
:*Original: "He looks to me like a guy who makes his wife keep a scrapbook for him" 
:*Paraphrase: "[Salinger] had fingered [Wilkie] as the sort of fellow who makes his wife keep an album of press clippings."  
Despite differences in wording and sentence structure, the court found this to be a close paraphrase of a highly original expression.{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=287}}
In this case, the close paraphrasing was considered to contribute to the "amount and substantiality" of the material that had been copied - that is, paraphrasing is a form of copying.{{sfn|Saint-Amour|2011|p=222}}
The court also found that Hamilton's practice of including phrases like "Salinger says," or "he said" within his paraphrase could give readers of the biography the false impression that they had read Salinger's own words. They might therefore decide not to buy a collection of the original letters. The court found that this meant there would be a financial impact.
The court barred publication.{{sfn|SALINGER v. RANDOM HOUSE, INC 1987}}

The case of ''[[Wright v. Warner Books]]'' (1991) was superficially similar to ''Salinger''.
[[Margaret Walker]] wrote an unauthorized biography of [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], best known for his  books ''[[Native Son]]'' and ''[[Black Boy]]'', 
in which she made "sparing  use" of excerpts from the subject's unpublished letters and journals.
Ellen Wright, Richard Wright's widow, sued the author and [[Warner Books]], the publisher.{{sfn|Gaines|1992|p=175}}
In one example, the book paraphrased as follows from an unpublished letter that Wright had written:
:*Original: "Ellen, Julia, and Rachel will be here on Tuesday: they'll stay for two days.  Don't know what will happen when they get here. I'm hoping for peace and quiet."
:*Paraphrase: "Early in 1960, Wright wrote to Margrit de Sabloniere that Ellen, Julia, and Rachel would be arriving for a two or three day visit. Wright said that he did not know what would happen when they arrived but that he was hoping for peace and quiet."
Despite the apparent similarity, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that copyright had not been infringed.
The paraphrasing was just "straightforward and factual reportage" of the "most basic and banal factual matter."{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=286}}

==Exclusions==

There are cases where there is very little choice about how to express some fact or idea, so a copy or close paraphrase may be unavoidable.
In this case, the "[[Merger doctrine (copyright law)|merger doctrine]]" comes into play.
The fact or idea and the expression are seen as merged, and the expression cannot be protected.
The merger doctrine is typically applied only to factual information or scientific theories, not to imaginative works such as plays or novels where the author has a much broader choice of expression.{{sfn|Fishman|2011|p=288}}
The merger doctrine has been applied to the user interface design of computer software, where similarity between icons used by two different programs is acceptable if only a very limited number of icons would be recognizable by users, such as an image looking like a page to represent a document.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=47}}
However, in 1994 a U.K. judge in ''Ibcos Computers v. Barclays Mercantile Finance'' cast doubt on the merger doctrine, saying he was not comfortable with the idea that "if there is only one way of expressing an idea that way is not the subject of copyright."{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=45}}
[[File:Richard Posner at Harvard University.jpg|thumb|Judge [[Richard Posner]] has argued that websites should be legally required to obtain permission before paraphrasing news sources.]]
The term "Scenes a faire" means "obligatory scene", a scene in a play that the audience "has been permitted to foresee and to desire from the progress of the action; and such a scene can never be omitted without a consequent dissatisfaction."  The term was applied to copyright law in ''[[Cain v. Universal Pictures]]'' (1942), where the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California]] ruled that "... similarities and incidental details necessary to the environment or setting of an action are not the material of which copyrightable originality consists."{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=52}}
The concept has been used by U.S. and U.K. courts.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=54}}
The term is used both in the sense of a scene that follows inevitably from a situation,
or a standard scene that is always included in a particular genre of work.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=53}}
Another court said "Under the ... doctrine of ''[[scènes à faire]]'', courts will not protect a copyrighted work from infringement if the expression embodied in the work necessarily flows from a commonplace idea."{{sfn|Iyer|2012|p=53}}
The concept has been extended to computer software, where some aspects may be dictated by the problem to be solved, or may be standard programming techniques.{{sfn|Lai|2000|p=59}}

==Permission agreements==

Publishers may formally allow limited quotation but prohibit paraphrasing, since they do not want readers to mistake the paraphrase for the original work.
In this case they would prohibit alteration of the work in their permission agreement.  
Although paraphrasing may be considered [[fair use]] under copyright law it may be considered breach of contract when the author of the paraphrase has implicitly or explicitly accepted a permission agreement.{{sfn|Stim|2010|p=46}}

Judge [[Richard Posner]] has argued in his blog in favor of laws that require online sites to obtain permission from the copyright holder before linking to or paraphrasing copyrighted materials from newspapers.  His concern is that existing laws based on fair use may not provide sufficient protection to the newspapers, who are paying for expensive news collection while the websites essentially get a free ride.  Without greater protection, Judge Posner considers that the result of widespread paraphrasing of newspapers on internet sites could be a drastic reduction in the number of news-gathering sources.{{sfn|Posner|2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13400">A '''perverse incentive''' is an [[incentive]] that has an unintended and undesirable result which is contrary to the interests of the incentive makers. Perverse incentives are a type of negative [[unintended consequence]] or [[cobra effect]].

==Examples==
{{multiple issues|section=y|{{Prose|section|date=July 2015}}
{{example farm|section|date=October 2015}}}}
* In [[Hanoi]], under French colonial rule, a program paying people a bounty for each rat tail handed in was intended to exterminate rats. Instead, it led to the farming of rats.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael G. Vann]], "Of Rats, Rice, and Race: The Great Hanoi Rat Massacre, an Episode in French Colonial History," French Colonial History Society, May, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Duplessis Orphans]]: Between 1945 and 1960, the federal Canadian government paid 70 cents a day per orphan to orphanages, and psychiatric hospitals received $2.25 per day, per patient. Allegedly, up to 20,000 orphaned children were falsely certified as mentally ill so the government of the province of [[Quebec]] could get $2.25 per day, per patient.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1WNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EvIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6929%2C5814760 Protesters in straitjackets demand inquiry of Duplessis Orphans era]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DeceAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WHsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6753%2C1774080 Allegations of child abuse]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lT9TAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6732%2C2759782 Orphans sue Catholic orders over mistreatment]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Extermination of sparrows in China that ate grain per the [[Four Pests Campaign]] led to the explosion of the Locust population and compounding the ecological problems already caused by the [[Great Leap Forward]].
* Funding [[fire department]]s by the number of fire calls made is intended to reward the fire departments that do the most work. However, it may discourage them from fire-prevention activities, which reduce the number of fires.&lt;ref&gt;Department for Communities and Local Government (2002). [http://www.local.dtlr.gov.uk/review/consult/fire.pdf "Fire"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040801032503/http://www.local.dtlr.gov.uk/review/consult/fire.pdf |date=2004-08-01 }}. In ''Consultation on the Local Government Finance Formula Grant Distribution''. Retrieved November 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*19th century [[palaeontology|palaeontologists]] travelling to [[China]] used to pay peasants for each fragment of [[dinosaur]] bone (dinosaur [[fossils]]) that they produced. They later discovered that the peasants dug up the bones and then smashed them into many pieces, greatly reducing their scientific value, to maximise their payments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Bryson]], ''[[A Short History of Nearly Everything]]''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2017|talk=Chinese peasants vs. palaeontologists example}}
* Paying medical professionals and reimbursing insured patients for treatment but not prevention encourages medical conditions to be ignored until treatment is required.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Robinson,
Reinvention of Health Insurance in the Consumer Era (2004). In ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]], April 21, 2004; 291: 1880–1886''. Retrieved 2008-01-12&lt;/ref&gt; Also, paying only for treatment effectively discourages prevention (which would reduce the demand for future treatments and would also improve quality of life for the patient). Payment for treatment also generates a perverse incentive for unnecessary treatments which could be harmful, for example in the form of side effects of drugs and surgery. These side effects themselves can then trigger a demand for further treatments.
* [[Bangkok]] police used [[tartan]] armbands as a badge of shame for minor infractions, but they were treated as collectibles by offending officers forced to wear them. Since 2007, they have been using armbands with the cute [[Hello Kitty]] cartoon character to avoid the perverse incentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Myndans |first=Seth |date=2007-08-25 |title=Cute Kitty Is Pink Badge of Shame in Bangkok |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/world/asia/08thai.html |accessdate=2007-11-06 |quote=It is the pink armband of shame for wayward police officers, as cute as it can be, with a Hello Kitty face and a pair of linked hearts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Endangered Species Act]] in the US imposes development restrictions on landowners who find endangered species on their property. While this policy is well-intentioned and has some positive effects for wildlife, it also encourages preemptive habitat destruction (draining swamps or cutting down trees that might host valuable species) by landowners who fear losing the use of their land because of the presence of an endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/magazine/20wwln-freak-t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;sq=unintended%20consequences&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1 ''Unintended Consequences''], New York Times Magazine, 20 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, endangered species may even be [[shooting, shoveling, and shutting up|deliberately killed]] to avoid discovery. Similarly, if the fine or other penalty for committing environmental damage is perceived as less burdensome than the cost of preventing the damage in the first place, an individual or company may not place safeguards in place and simply pay the penalty if the damage occurs.
* Providing company executives with bonuses for reporting higher earnings encouraged executives at [[Fannie Mae]] and other large corporations to inflate earnings statements artificially and make decisions targeting short-term gains at the expense of long-term profitability.&lt;ref&gt;Bebchuk, L., &amp; Fried, J. M. (2005) [https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1037596901/executive-compensation-at-fannie-mae-a-case-study "Executive Compensation at Fannie Mae: A Case Study of Perverse Incentives, Nonperformance Pay, and Camouflage"] ''Journal of Corporation Law'', '''30''' (4): 807–822.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Before the [[Anatomy Act 1832]], executed criminals were the only legal source of bodies for hospitals to use for surgeon training in the United Kingdom. Due to high demand from chronic shortage of legal cadavers, "[[Body-snatching|resurrection men]]" resorted to illegal means to obtain bodies, such as digging up corpses from graveyards or even murder. In 1828, [[Burke and Hare murders|William Burke and William Hare]] murdered 16 people and sold the bodies. Thomas Williams and John Bishop, part of a group of body snatchers known as the [[London Burkers]], committed murder for the purpose of selling the victim's body in 1831.
* In building the [[first transcontinental railroad]] in the 1860s, the [[United States Congress]] agreed to pay the builders per mile of track laid. As a result, [[Thomas C. Durant]] of [[Union Pacific Railroad]] lengthened a section of the route forming a bow shape unnecessarily adding miles of track.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Zwonitzer, writer, PBS American Experience documentary "Transcontinental Railroad"  (2006) [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/tcrr-transcript/ "Program Transcript . Transcontinental Railroad . WGBH American Experience" ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "[[welfare trap]]" occurs when money earned through part-time or minimum-wage employment result in a reduction in [[state benefit]]s which is greater than that amount. This creates a barrier to low-income workers re-entering the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aims.ca/op-ed/gassing-up-the-welfare-trap-machine/ "Gassing up the welfare trap machine"], 6 January 1997, [[Atlantic Institute for Market Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; Underlying factors include a full tax exemption for public assistance while employment income is taxed, a pattern of welfare paying more per dependent child (while employers are prohibited from discriminating in this manner, and their workers often must purchase daycare), or loss of welfare eligibility for the working poor ending other means-tested benefits (public medical, dental or prescription drug plans, subsidised housing, legal aid) which are expensive to replace at full market rates. If the withdrawal of means-tested benefits that comes with entering low-paid work causes there to be no significant increase in total income or even a net loss, then this gives a powerful disincentive to take on such work.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
* [[Real estate broker]]s have an inherent conflict of interest with sellers they represent because their usual commission structures motivate them to sell quickly more than it motivates them to sell at a higher price. However, a broker representing a buyer has a distinct disincentive to negotiate a lower price on behalf of their client, because they will simultaneously be negotiating their own commission lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why a Real Estate Agent May Skip the Extra Mile |author=Daniel Gross |date=20 Feb 2005 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/business/yourmoney/why-a-real-estate-agent-may-skip-the-extra-mile.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529190902/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/business/yourmoney/why-a-real-estate-agent-may-skip-the-extra-mile.html |archivedate=29 May 2015 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Do Real Estate Brokers Add Value When Listing Services Are Unbundled? |date=13 Jan 2012 |author1=B.

* Awarding carbon credits for destroying the greenhouse gas [[HFC-23]] incentivized increased manufacture of the refrigerant [[HCFC-22]] (chlorodifluoromethane) whose production included HFC-23 as a by-product.

* Under the US [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program, doctors are reimbursed at a higher rate if they prescribe more expensive medications to treat a condition.

* The [[devolved]] government in [[Northern Ireland]] enabled business owners to make profits guaranteed for 20 years by simply using more and more heating energy to heat their premises in their [[Renewable Heat Incentive scandal|Renewable Heat Incentive]] scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-38414486|title=RHI scandal: RHI 'cash for ash' scandal to cost NI taxpayers £490m|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declared objectives of the scheme were to ''reduce'' energy usage and promote switching to [[Environmentally friendly|green]] sources.
* The [[Wells Fargo account fraud scandal]] resulted from incentives intended to increase the number of accounts sold, but overly ambitious quotas combined with the threat of career ruin if quotas were not met caused some employees to open large numbers of accounts without customer permission.
* The 2008 housing crisis resulted in 27 million subprime mortages outstanding which government sponsored enterprises were mandated by government to own 19.2 million. The intent was for poorer people to own homes. The result was a housing bust, which led to low house prices, which led to financial institution instabilities which caused a greater proportion of poor people to lose their homes.

[[File:Antike Polychromie 1.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed color scheme of the [[entablature]] on a [[Doric temple]].]]
'''Polychrome''' is the "'practice of decorating architectural elements, sculpture, etc., in a variety of colors."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Cyril M., ed. ''Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture'', Dover Publications, New York, c. 1977, 1983 edition&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is used to refer to certain [[styles of architecture]], [[pottery]] or sculpture in multiple colors. 

==Classical world==

{{further|Ancient Greek art#Polychromy}}
Some very early polychrome pottery has been excavated on [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]] such as at the [[Bronze Age]] site of [[Phaistos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10857/phaistos.html#fieldnotes C. Michael Hogan, ''Knossos Fieldnotes'', The Modern Antiquarian (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Greece]] sculptures were painted in strong colors. The paint was frequently limited to parts depicting clothing, hair, and so on, with the skin left in the natural color of the stone. But it could cover sculptures in their totality. The painting of Greek sculpture should not merely be seen as an enhancement of their sculpted form but has the characteristics of a distinct style of art. For example, the pedimental sculptures from the [[Temple of Aphaia]] on [[Aegina]] have recently{{when?|date=December 2012}} been demonstrated to have been painted with bold and elaborate patterns, depicting, amongst other details, patterned clothing. The polychrome of stone statues was paralleled by the use of materials to distinguish skin, clothing and other details in [[chryselephantine sculpture]]s, and by the use of metals to depict lips, nipples, etc., on high-quality bronzes like the [[Riace bronzes]].

An early example of polychrome decoration was found in the [[Parthenon]] atop the [[Acropolis of Athens]]. By the time European antiquarianism took off in the 18th century, however, the paint that had been on classical buildings had completely weathered off. Thus, the antiquarians' and architects' first impressions of these ruins were that classical beauty was expressed only through shape and composition, lacking in robust colors, and it was that impression which informed [[neoclassical architecture]]. However, some classicists such as [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]] noticed traces of paint on classical architecture and this slowly came to be accepted. Such acceptance was later accelerated by observation of minute color traces by microscopic and other means, enabling less tentative reconstructions than Hittorff and his contemporaries had been able to produce. An example of classical Greek architectural polychrome may be seen in the full size [[Parthenon (Nashville)|replica of the Parthenon]] exhibited in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], US.

==Medieval world==
Throughout medieval Europe religious sculptures in wood and other media were often brightly painted or colored, as were the interiors of church buildings. These were often destroyed or whitewashed during [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]] phases of the [[Protestant Reformation]] or in other unrest such as the [[French Revolution]], though some have survived in museums such as the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A]], [[Musée de Cluny]] and [[Louvre]].

The exteriors of churches were painted as well, but little has survived. Exposure to the elements and changing tastes and religious approval over time acted against their preservation. The "Majesty Portal" of the [[Collegiate church of Toro]] is the most extensive remaining example, due to the construction of a chapel which enclosed and protected it from the elements just a century after it was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Melissa R. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/767201 Architectural Polychromy and the Painters' Trade in Medieval Spain]''. Gesta. Vol. 41, No. 1, Artistic Identity in the Late Middle Ages (2002), pp. 3-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baroque and Rococo periods==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
While stone and metal sculpture normally remained uncolored, like the classical survivals, polychromed wood sculptures were produced by Spanish artists: [[Juan Martínez Montañés]], [[Gregorio Fernández]] (17th century); German: [[Ignaz Günther]], [[Phillip Jacob Straub]] (18th century), or Brazilian: [[Aleijadinho]] (19th century).&lt;!---Gap - the following is rather US-centric - British Gothic revival was highly polychromatic, for example.---&gt;

With the arrival of European [[porcelain]] in the 18th century, brightly colored pottery figurines with a wide range of colors became very popular.

==19th century polychrome brickwork==
[[File:Rippon Lea.jpg|thumb|right|Rippon Lea Estate, in Australia has polychrome brickwork patterns.]]
{{main|Polychrome brickwork}}
Polychrome brickwork is a style of architectural brickwork which emerged in the 1860s and used bricks of different colors (typically brown, cream and red) in patterned combination to highlight architectural features. It was often used to replicate the effect of [[Quoin (architecture)|quoining]] and to decorate around windows. Early examples featured banding, with later examples exhibiting complex diagonal, criss-cross, and step patterns, in some cases even writing using bricks.

==20th century==
In the twentieth century there were notable periods of polychromy in architecture, from the expressions of Art Nouveau throughout Europe, to the international flourishing of Art Deco or Art Moderne, to the development of postmodernism in the latter decades of the century. During these periods, brickwork, stone, tile, stucco and metal facades were designed with a focus on the use of new colors and patterns, while architects often looked for inspiration to historical examples ranging from Islamic tilework to English Victorian brick. In the 1970s and 1980s, especially, architects working with bold colors included [[Robert Venturi]] ([[Allen Memorial Art Museum]] addition; Best Company Warehouse), [[Michael Graves]] ([[Snyderman House]]; Humana Building), and [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] (Neue Staatsgalerie; [[Arthur M. Sackler Museum]]), among others.

===United States===
[[File:Kendallville-indiana-architectural-detail.jpg|thumb|300px|Polychrome Victorian-era architectural detail in [[Kendallville, Indiana]].]]
Polychrome building facades later rose in popularity as a way of highlighting certain trim features in Victorian and [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]] [[architecture]] in the [[United States]]. The rise of the modern paint industry following the [[American Civil War]] also helped to fuel the (sometimes extravagant) use of multiple colors.

The polychrome facade style faded with the rise of the 20th century's revival movements, which stressed classical colors applied in restrained fashion and, more importantly, with the birth of modernism, which advocated clean, unornamented facades rendered in white stucco or paint. Polychromy reappeared with the flourishing of the preservation movement and its embrace of (what had previously been seen as) the excesses of the Victorian era and in [[San Francisco, California]] in the 1970s to describe its abundant late-nineteenth-century houses. These earned the endearment '[[Painted Ladies]]', a term that in modern times is considered [[kitsch]] when it is applied to describe all Victorian houses that have been painted with period colors.

[[John Joseph Earley]] (1881–1945) developed a "polychrome" process of concrete slab construction and ornamentation that was admired across America. In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, his products graced a variety of buildings &amp;mdash; all formed by the staff of the Earley Studio in [[Rosslyn, Virginia]]. Earley's [[Polychrome Historic District]] houses in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] were built in the mid-1930s. The concrete panels were pre-cast with colorful stones and shipped to the lot for on-site assembly. Earley wanted to develop a higher standard of affordable housing after the Depression, but only a handful of the houses were built before he died; written records of his concrete casting techniques were destroyed in a fire. Less well-known, but just as impressive, is the Dr. Fealy Polychrome House that Earley built atop a hill in Southeast Washington, D.C. overlooking the city. His uniquely designed polychrome houses were outstanding among prefabricated houses in the country, appreciated for their Art Deco ornament and superb craftsmanship.

==Polychromatic light==
The term '''polychromatic''' means having several colors. It is used to describe [[light]] that exhibits more than one [[color]], which also means that it contains radiation of more than one [[wavelength]]. The study of polychromatics is particularly useful in the production of [[diffraction grating]]s.

'''''Pretty Persuasion''''' is a 2005 American [[black comedy]] film directed by [[Marcos Siega]], written by Skander Halim, and starring [[Evan Rachel Wood]], [[James Woods]], [[Ron Livingston]], [[Elisabeth Harnois]], and [[Jane Krakowski]]. Its plot follows a 15-year-old student at an elite [[Beverly Hills]] academy who accuses her drama teacher of [[sexual harassment]].

==Plot==
Kimberly Joyce is a precocious, [[psychopathy|sociopathic]] high school student at Roxbury Academy, an elite preparatory school in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]]. She and her best friend Brittany take Randa, a new [[Muslim]] student who recently [[immigration|immigrated]] from the [[Middle East]], under their wing. Kimberly's home life is troubled; her [[bigot]]ed and disaffected father Hank, an electronics executive, shows little interest in her life, while her vapid stepmother, Kathy, constantly attempts to reprimand her for her coarse language and attitude. Kimberly dreams of becoming an actress, and obtains a coveted role as [[Anne Frank]] in the school play.

The school drama teacher, Percy Anderson, orders Kimberly and Randa to after-school detention one day for disrupting class, and forces Kimberly to write an essay reflecting on her transgression. Percy takes the essay home that evening and has his wife, Grace, read it aloud provocatively as a [[Sexual roleplay|role play]] before the two engage in sex. After Brittany is publicly humiliated by Percy during an acting exercise, Kimberly devises a plan to accuse him of [[sexual harassment|sexually harassing]] each of them. Unable to afford an attorney, Percy agrees to his friend Roger{{en dash}} a clueless high school law teacher who passed the bar{{en dash}} acting as his attorney. In court, Roger proposes that the accusations are in retaliation to Kimberly having been replaced in the school play after referring to her Jewish classmate Josh's lawyer father as a "money-grubbing [[shyster]]."

The case becomes a media sensation covered extensively by Emily Klein, a local [[lesbian]] reporter. Shortly after the trial begins, Kimberly has a sexual encounter with Emily. She manipulates Josh with [[oral sex]] into convincing his father Larry, a renowned defense attorney, to defend Percy ''[[pro bono]]''. When Larry cross examines Brittany, she confesses on the stand that she, Kimberly, and Randa fabricated the accusations. When Emily confronts her outside the courthouse, Kimberly reveals she filmed their sexual encounter, and uses it as [[blackmail]] to receive favorable press coverage.

Overwhelmed with the shame brought on her family by the false accusations, Randa shoots herself to death at school. Grace, now aware the essay Percy had her read was written by Kimberly, leaves him. In the storm of media coverage, Emily extolls Kimberly as a mere "victim" of society, and the ensuing press incites Hollywood producers to give Kimberly a [[bit part]] on a daytime [[soap opera]]. 

When Brittany visits Kimberly at her house, Kimberly reveals she manipulated Josh into having his father defend Percy as she knew it would cause Brittany to buckle under pressure in court. When Brittany asks why, Kimberly explains that she devised the calculated plot to garner publicity for herself, as well as exact revenge against Brittany for having stolen her ex-boyfriend, Troy. Brittany lambasts her and leaves, vowing never to speak to her again. Kimberly turns on the television and sees herself on the episode of the soap opera. As she watches herself onscreen, tears begin streaming down her face.

'''R. John Wright Dolls''' is an [[art doll]] making workshop located in [[Bennington, Vermont]]. Established in 1976, R. John Wright Dolls (RJW) is a privately held company founded by R. John Wright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2004/05/31/story3.html|title = Incentives and hometown pull prompt doll maker to leave NY|last = Margiotta|first = Christine|date = 2004|journal = Albany Business Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company designs, produces and markets original felt doll and plush animal lines along with many licensed products including [[Winnie-the-Pooh]], [[Raggedy Ann]], [[Beatrix Potter]] characters, Classic [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Paddington Bear]], and [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]. The dolls are designed by John and Susan Wright and produced in numbered limited editions at the R. John Wright workshop in Bennington, Vermont.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:R. John Wright Winnie the Pooh Bear.jpg|thumb|422x422px|Classic Winnie-the-Pooh by R. John Wright, 1998]]
R. John Wright was born and raised in Michigan where he attended [[Wayne State University]] and worked towards a degree in [[Liberal arts education|Liberal Arts]]. Two years later, having relocated to New England, he met his wife Susan who had a degree in [[Fine art|Fine Arts]] from the [[University of New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.worldcollectorsnet.com/magazine/iss23p4/|title = Collecting R. John Wright Dolls|date = |accessdate = |website = World Collectors Net|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1976, while living in Brattleboro, Vermont, R. John Wright created his first felt doll in the image of a simple male [[Folklore|folk]] character. Production commenced at the couples' ground-floor apartment. These early dolls were primarily sold at juried [[Craft#Craft fairs|craft fairs]] along the east coast including the [[American Craft Council]] (ACC) exhibitions in [[Rhinebeck (village), New York|Rhinebeck, New York]]. The technique and style of the R. John Wright dolls underwent significant changes throughout 1977-78.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Goddu|first1 = Krystyna Poray|title = R. John Wright: The Art of Toys|date = February 1, 2004|publisher = Reverie Publishing; 1st edition|isbn = 1932485147|pages = 36|edition = 1st|url = https://www.amazon.com/R-John-Wright-The-Toys/dp/1932485147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early felt dolls of the [[Richard Steiff|Steiff Company]] were a strong inspiration. The Wrights were also inspired by the early molded cloth dolls of [[Käthe Kruse|Kathe Kruse]] and the felt [[Lenci doll]]s.  In 1978, through trial and error, the Wrights were able to reinvent the art of molded felt dolls using their own techniques.

In 1978, R. John Wright joined the United Federation of Doll Clubs&lt;ref&gt;[http://ufdc.org/ United Federation of Doll Clubs]&lt;/ref&gt; (UFDC) and was elected to the National Institute of American Doll Artists&lt;ref&gt;[http://niada.org/ the National Institute of American Doll Artists]&lt;/ref&gt; (NIADA) where he served as the Standards Chairman of the organization.

In 1981, the R. John Wright facility relocated from [[Brattleboro, Vermont]] to [[Cambridge, New York]].

Beginning in 1987, every R. John Wright item features a 8mm brass identification button inscribed with the initials 'RJW.'

In 2005 the R. John Wright facility relocated from Cambridge, New York to Bennington, Vermont. All work continues to be done on-site under the Wrights' direct supervision.[[File:Doll artist R.

== Disney Editions ==
In 1984 R. John Wright Inc. began a 13-year relationship with the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company]] with the development of a range of dolls and animals based closely on the original illustrations by [[E. H. Shepard]] in the [[Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie-the-Pooh books]] by [[A. A. Milne]]. These products ushered in a new licensing division titled “Classic [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Winnie the Pooh]]”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which was a departure in Disney's marketing of [[Winnie the Pooh (character)|Winnie the Pooh]] products in the U.S. Several editions of Winnie-the-Pooh and other characters from the [[Hundred Acre Wood]] were produced.

"I am grateful that somehow I was given the strength—and the unfounded optimism—to begin making dolls.

'''re.press''' is a [[Melbourne]] ([[Australia]]) based [[open access]] publisher of [[contemporary philosophy]] (and some theory and [[poetry]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spunc.com.au/members/re-press |title=re.press - The Small Press Network |publisher=Spunc.com.au |date= |accessdate=2015-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716224200/http://spunc.com.au/members/re-press |archivedate=2015-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; re.press is an independent publisher that seeks to promote [[Philosophy|philosophical]] ideas through making many of its works available for free in electronic form (PDF downloads) in addition to hard-copy paperbacks.

==History==
re.press began publishing in 2006 with the edited collection “The Praxis of Alain Badiou”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.re-press.org/content/view/21/38/ |title=The Praxis of Alain Badiou |publisher=Re-press.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then has published authors such as [[Alain Badiou]], [[G. W. F. Hegel]], [[Graham Harman]], [[Andrew Benjamin]], [[Reza Negarestani]] and the poet [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://dossierjournal.com/books/repress-open-access/ |title=Re.press Open Access |publisher=Dossier Journal |date=2009-07-22 |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open access==
re.press was one of the first publishers to offer [[open access book|books as open access]] or free downloads. There has been some discussion of the “re.press model” on the blogging network and whether this is a sustainable model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inthemedievalmiddle.com/2009/06/open-access-and-academic-publishing.html |title=In the Middle: Open Access and Academic Publishing, Again |publisher=Inthemedievalmiddle.com |date=2009-06-21 |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewcullison.com/2009/09/open-access-philosophy-and-self-publishing-books/ |title=Open Access Philosophy and Self-Publishing |publisher=Andrew Cullison |date= |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poynder.blogspot.com/ |title=Open and Shut? |publisher=Poynder.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series==
re.press publishes in three series: Anamnesis, Transmission and Anomaly. Anamnesis and Transmission publish philosophy and Anomaly publishes other works including poetry and speculative fiction. The open access free downloads seem to be confined to the Anamnesis and Transmission series.

==Cover art==
According to re.press’ website they are committed to “maximizing design values, boosting clarity and aesthetic qualities”. This commitment is expressed through the use of Melbourne-based artists on their covers. According to their website:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“re.press aims to publish the best philosophical works available, whether these emerge from well-established or from previously unknown thinkers, whether they are from the North or the South, the East or the West, whether they are Platonists or Hegelians, materialists or idealists. True thought is global, universal, transformative, shredding ideologies and opinions like the statues of old dictators. But true thought also begins locally, in images and signs that may as yet have no recognisable reference or import. re.press' head offices are located in the city of Melbourne, Australia. And Melbourne is, as the art-critic Norbert Loeffler has remarked, one of the great art-cities of the world - without anybody knowing it. Lacking the established power, media and reputation of traditional centres of world art, Melbourne forces its artists to sustain themselves otherwise. Aware of contemporary work from all over the world, local artists transmute it for their own, often-obscure purposes, into unprecedented forms. re.press seeks, like an insatiable kleptoparasite, to draw off some of this aesthetic power for its own ends, by using their images for its cover-art.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://re-press.org/cover-art/ |title=Cover Art |publisher=Re-press.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saint Jerome in His Study''''' is an [[oil painting]] on panel attributed to the workshop of the [[early Netherlandish]] painter [[Jan van Eyck]], dated to 1442 (the year after the master's death) and now in the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], [[Detroit]].

==History==
Since the date on the painting is subsequent to Jan van Eyck's death (June 1441), it is likely that the work, left unfinished, had been completed by members of his workshop, or his brother Lambert.

A work with a similar subject is mentioned in the inventories of  [[Palazzo Medici]], in [[Florence]], which had been drawn up after the death of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] in 1492. Even if not the work now at Detroit, this could have been the latter's prototype, since the painting is not unanimously attributed to van Eyck. There are indeed striking similarities between this work and [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]'s [[Saint Jerome in His Study (Ghirlandaio)|''Saint Jerome in His Study'']] (1480).

==Description==

The painting depicts [[Saint Jerome]] in the traditional representation inside his study. He wears a cardinal's dress and [[Galero|hat]], and is reading a book, in a small study clogged with numerous objects showing his erudition and interests. Below is a lion, recalling the saint's legend in which he had extracted a thorn from the paw of the animal, who had later remained loyal to him. The light enters from a window behind the writing desk and from the foreground, in order to illuminate any detail of the scene. Objects on the desk and the shelves include an [[hourglass]], a [[pounce (calligraphy)|pounce pot]], a [[ruler]], an [[astrolabe]], numerous [[book]]s and writing instruments, all suitable for the idealized man of the [[Renaissance]].

'''''Saint Matthew and the Angel''''' (1602) is a painting from the Italian master [[Caravaggio]] (1571&amp;ndash;1610), completed for the [[Contarelli Chapel]] in the church of [[San Luigi dei Francesi]] in [[Rome]]. It was destroyed in 1945 and is now known only from black-and-white photographs and enhanced color reproductions.

==Style==
Caravaggio was known for painting very realistically, using models instead of standard convention and idealization.&lt;ref&gt;Spear, “Caravaggio,” 141.&lt;/ref&gt;  He made his figures lifelike and relatable, as opposed to portraying unrealistic or phony poses. In this instance, however, the patrons wanted an idealization of the beloved Saint, someone who its viewers could admire and strain to be like. They did not want a bumbling peasant who looked as if he just walked in off the street. With the [[angel]] sweeping down and the Saint’s stool teetering in movement, it is arguably one of Caravaggio’s earliest examples of his dynamic style.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, “Expressive Aspects of Caravaggio,” 642.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a much more exciting composition than the first. Even though Caravaggio changed the composition to suit the desires of the patron, you can still see his own style under the more refined subject of [[Saint Matthew]].

==History==
Saint Matthew and the Angel was completed in 1602. A part of the collection of the former [[Kaiser Friedrich Museum]], it was destroyed by fire at the end of [[World War II]] while stored in an anti-aircraft bunker in Berlin. This work, by a pillar of the [[Baroque]] movement, might have provided new information about the artist and patron. Reproductions of the original still survive.

==Commission==
''Saint Matthew and the Angel'' was created  as a commission for the Contarelli Chapel. Caravaggio was previously commissioned to paint two scenes of the saint’s life, and after the patrons were satisfied with them, a third was commissioned. 

The Contarelli Chapel was [[Dedication|dedicated]] to Saint Matthew. With funds left for its building left in 1585, it was completed in 1600. Cardinal Del Monte played a major part in orchestrating the decoration of its interior, and was the one who suggested Caravaggio as the painter of the scenes of Saint Matthew’s life. The altar was to be composed of two Caravaggio paintings as well as a statue of the saint by Flemish artist [[Jacob Cobaert]].&lt;ref&gt;Hess, “Contarelli Chapel,” 197.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the church was not pleased with the statue and Caravaggio was re-hired to do another piece as the center for the altar, to show Saint Matthew writing the [[Gospel of St Matthew|Gospel]] under the guidance of an angel. Caravaggio depicted the Saint as an unlearned peasant, gaping in the presence of the angel. The church rejected Caravaggio's irreverent presentation of the saint, and Caravaggio replaced it with a more glorifying image, ''[[The Inspiration of Saint Matthew]]'', which remains in the Chapel today.

==Comparison==
The comparison is not perfect because the only images available of the lost ''Saint Matthew and the Angel'' are black and white  photographs that were taken before World War II.  The lost painting showed Saint Matthew as poorly groomed, with dirty feet. Although this was the style of Caravaggio, the church leaders thought it was too crude and did not want to have what looked like a peasant hanging in their sacred altarpiece. In addition, they thought that this Matthew did not match the other two paintings that Caravaggio had already done. It was apparently disconnected and therefore had no place with the others. The second piece keeps true to the same subject, but with a few changes. Matthew looks more like the other two Matthews in the altar. The Saint is now more serious and in control in the presence of the angel. Instead of being fully controlled by the angel, Saint Matthew is only encouraged by the angel in the second one. He is working more on his own accord.

'''Shabby chic''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|iː|k}}) is a form of [[interior design]] where furniture and [[furnishing]]s are either chosen for their appearance of age and signs of wear and tear or where new items are [[distressing|distressed]] to achieve the appearance of an antique. At the same time, a soft, opulent, yet cottage-style decor, often with an affected feel is emphasized to differentiate it from genuine period decor.

==Description==
Shabby chic items are often heavily painted through the years, with many layers showing through obviously time-worn areas. The style is imitated in [[faux painting]] using [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]] or by painting then rubbing and sanding away the top coat to show the wood or base coats, known as "distressing" the finish of the furniture. Furniture pieces that are not genuine antiques are usually selected for their resemblance to older furniture styles, and may be reproduction furniture with a distressed finish. Elaborate furniture [[applique]]s depicting flower [[Swag (motif)|swags]] and [[garland]]s, [[cherubs]], and other motifs may be added.

Fabrics tend to be cottons and linens, with linen being particularly popular, inspired by old French linens. Pure whites, as well as [[ecru]]s and worn or [[bleach]]ed out [[Pastel (color)|pastel]] colors are favorites. Fabric is often stained with tea to give it the look of old fabric. Bleached and faded are terms often applied to the style. Vintage floral patterns with pastel colors, cotton [[ticking]] patterns, or linen in earth tones, are all typical of shabby chic style.

Antique pieces such as [[pie safe]]s and jelly cupboards are popular in shabby chic [[décor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shabby Chic Decorating|url=http://hotelsouthdakota.com/best-ways-select-bedspreads-luxury-bedding-sheets/shabby-chic-decorating-ideas/|work=Source|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides white, the shabby chic style also includes soft neutral colors such as sky blue, rose pink and beige tones. Hints from French-style interior design often show in shabby chic homes such as [[Rococo]]-style lighting fixtures, furniture or wall paneling.

The shabby chic aesthetic also expands to the garden, with the same design principles of using timeworn garden furniture and feminine accessories. Rose gardens are popular with the shabby chic style of décor.

Other popular décor items are pillows made of vintage [[barkcloth]] fabric, vintage linens, [[Chenille fabric|chenille]] bedspreads, vintage chandeliers, and anything with roses in the design. ''[[Newsweek]]'' used the term to describe [[avant-garde]] fashion designer [[Martin Margiela]]'s 1992 fall fashion show, which took place in a [[Salvation Army]] furniture store and featured models in "wrinkled jackets, baggy-kneed pants and coats with inner linings hanging down from unfinished hems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darnton|first1=N|title=Night of the living dead|journal=Newsweek|date=April 6, 1992|volume=119|issue=14|page=50|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decorators consider shabby chic a soft, relaxed, romantic style that looks comfortable and inviting, and is usually associated as feminine. Masculine shabby chic would be "rustic", with deeper or richer colors,  [[Rustic furniture]] using unfinished wood, denim, burlap, sailcloth and homespun.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Burch, [http://homeguides.sfgate.com/mix-shabby-chic-rustic-76828.html How to Mix Shabby Chic &amp; Rustic]. ''SFGate'', undated article in Home Guides.&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants of shabby chic style include:

* [[Cottage chic]]
* [[Beach cottage chic]]
* [[French country]]
* [[Gustavian]] (Swedish)

==History==
[[File:Distressed finish vintage dresser.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Dressing table|dresser]] with a [[Distressing|distressed]] finish and mismatched drawer knobs, in Shabby chic style]]
The style started in [[Great Britain]] and evokes the type of decoration found in large country houses where there are worn and faded old [[chintz]] sofas and curtains, old paintwork and unassuming "good" taste. The end result of shabby chic is to achieve an elegant overall effect, as opposed to the sentimentally cute Pop-Victorian. Recycling old furniture and fabrics is an important aspect of the look and was especially popular with modern Bohemians and artisans that made up a sidelined counter-culture movement during the 1980s when expensive quality decor became very fashionable with the upper middle classes. The original shabby chic interiors were usually considered in themselves works of art.

The early forms of shabby chic were rather grand but the style has evolved taking inspiration from many forms of decoration. These range from 18th century [[Sweden|Swedish]] painted decoration, the French [[Chateau]] as well as the American [[Shakers]] where simplicity and plainness was essential.

Rachel Ashwell founded a furniture chain called Shabby Chic, and in 1996, published a book around the aesthetic she described as "the aura of old money, cushy comfort, and crafted indifference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williamson|first1=Gayle A|title=Book reviews: Arts &amp; humanities|journal=Library Journal|date=September 15, 1996 |volume=121 |issue=15 |page=66 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of term==
The term was coined by ''[[World of Interiors|The World of Interiors]]'' magazine in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/property/article-2688810/Threadbare-carpets-creaky-floors-Dont-fret-shabby-chic-never-fashionable.html|publisher=MailOnline|date=11 July 2014|first=Jenny|last=Coad|title=Threadbare carpets, grubby walls, creaky floors? Don't fret - the shabby chic look has never been more fashionable}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became extremely popular in the [[United States]] in the 1990s with a certain eclectic surge of decorating styles with paints and effects, notably in metropolitan cultural centers on the West Coast of America, such as [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]], with heavy influences from Mediterranean cultures such as [[Provence, France|Provence]], [[Tuscany]], and [[Greece]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

'''''The Freewoman''''' was a feminist weekly published between 23 November 1911 and 10 October 1912 and edited by [[Dora Marsden]] and [[Mary Gawthorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Freewoman: A Weekly Feminist Review|url=http://www.modjourn.org/render.php?view=mjp_object&amp;id=FreewomanCollection|work=The Modernist Journals Project|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''The Freewoman'' published articles on women's waged work, housework, motherhood, the [[suffrage movement]], and literature, its notoriety and influence rested on its frank discussions of sexuality, morality, and marriage.  ''The Freewoman'' urged tolerance for male homosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Cohler, Deborah. Citizen, Invert, Queer: Lesbianism and War in Early Twentieth Century Britain. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 2010. p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; advocated for [[free love]], and encouraged women to remain unmarried.

''The Freewoman'''s editorial stance distinguished it sharply from the attitude of [[suffragists]] like [[Millicent Fawcett]], who was so disturbed at the journal's approach to sexuality that she tore the first issue into little pieces.

In March 1912 Gawthorpe resigned due to poor health and disagreements with Marsden. In September 1912, [[W H Smith]] refused to carry ''The Freewoman'' and in October 1912, the journal folded.

Although its circulation probably never exceeded 200, it had a significant influence in [[Modernist]] circles. Among its contributors were [[Rebecca West]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Edward Carpenter]], and [[Guy Aldred]].

In June 1913 Marsden started ''[[The New Freewoman]]'' which was more concerned with literary modernism than feminism and was funded by [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]]. In 1914, ''The New Freewoman'' became [[The Egoist (periodical)|''The Egoist'']].

==Creation of ''The Freewoman''==
''The Freewoman'' was a feminist journal/newspaper in publication during the early twentieth century in Britain. [[Dora Marsden]] founded ''The Freewoman'' in November 1911, but the paper was also co-edited by [[Mary Gawthorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Cary|title=Marketing Edwardian Feminism: Dora Marsden, Votes for Women and The Freewoman|journal=Women's History Review|year=2002|volume=11|issue=4|pages=632|doi=10.1080/09612020200200341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being edited by both women, Marsden initially used Gawthorpe for her name and influence in the feminist society to give the paper creditability and popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Cary|title=Marketing Edwardian Feminism|pages=636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was rooted in more radical feminist ideals that stretched beyond strictly suffrage. Marsden focused the paper around the discussion of sex and the idea of being sexual, causing many issues to arise amongst readers. After the first issue of ''The Freewoman'', the female readers, many of whom grew up during the Victorian era of feminism, thought the views presented did not reflect the ideals of the feminism they had grown to understand. One of their main objectives was the papers very obvious discussions and references to sex. 
In the paper’s first issue it stated that it sought to represent the feminist movement through intellectual thought by actual feminists of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Dora|author2=Mary Gawthorpe|journal=The Freewoman|date=November 1911|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It touched on the idea of marriage, motherhood, sexuality, women’s rights, and the domestic man. Its radical approach on these ideas seemed misplaced for the twentieth century, however its influence amongst the feminist and sexual radicals was greater than its small circulation implied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bland|first=Lucy|title=Heterosexuality, Feminism and The Freewoman Journal in Early Twentieth-century England|journal=Women's History Review|year=1995|volume=4|issue=1|page=9|doi=10.1080/09612029500200074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Freewoman'' ideals==
According to many of the female readers, ''The Freewoman'' expressed beliefs more radical than most feminists during the early twentieth century. In the paper’s first issue it discussed the definition of marriage. To ''The Freewoman'' marriage did not only mean men and women, nor did it mean that a couple had to have children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Dora|author2=Mary Gawthorpe|title=The Freewoman|date=November 1911|volume=1|issue=1|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the women who were raised during the Victorian era, this concept of marriage did not register with them. Marriage in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and even in the current day, meant a man and woman and usually resulted in children. However, with the job opportunities and improved possibility of economic and social independence from the years preceding and during the war, women were able to forge a new identity separate from the confines of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bland|first=Lucy|title=Heterosexuality, Feminism and The Freewoman|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As feminism began to grow throughout the twentieth century the paper began to put a new label on these radical and forward thinking feminists: The New Woman.

''The Freewoman'' began to redefine and transform feminism from being solely related to suffrage and the suffrage movement, but to show feminism in its purest form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delap|first=Lucy|title=Philosophical vacuity and political ineptitude’: The Freewoman’s critique of the suffrage movement|journal=Women's History Review|year=2002|volume=11|issue=4|page=614|doi=10.1080/09612020200200340}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aimed to say that feminists needed to strive for more than just the right to vote. Marsden’s rather liberal and forward thinking opinion on the definition of feminism is what caused future debates amongst other prominent feminists of the time. The New Woman was to be a politically, socially and economically independent woman. ''The Freewoman'' did not reject the domestic life that most women during the twentieth century lived, but rather used the domestic life of a woman as a tool to show women that they could take an active role in protecting their interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delap|first=Lucy|title=The Freewoman's critque of the suffrage movement|page=615}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the paper’s third publication it discussed the idea of the domestic man. It raised the idea that a man can do the work of a woman in the domestic sphere. The goal was to “work towards the evolution of the New Housekeeping.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Dora|author2=Mary Gawthorpe|title=The Freewoman|date=December 1911|volume=1|issue=3|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its rationale hinged on the argument that the house and its inner workings were no different from that of a restaurant or even a milliner’s shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Dora|author2=Mary Gawthorpe|title=The Freewoman|date=December 1911|volume=1|issue=3|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper also suggested the idea of communal cooking and man and wife dividing up the household duties that would allow women to work outside of the domestic life. This idea of the domestic man also supported the idea of the homosexual family. With a man being able to do the domestic work, it presented the idea that man and man could live as a couple. To say that this openly happened is not likely, however ''The Freewoman'' implied and even supported this life style choice. The paper again showed its liberal and progressive beliefs with its idea of the domestic man.

The Freewoman stated that: "It is high time for a reversal of the servile notion of government from above. Free government proceeds from the individual outwards, not from the sum total inwards. It is for this reason that, considering the trend of Syndicalism, we are of the opinion that it is likely to make a far more intimate appeal to the nation than Socialism ever has. Its aims are the same: the means of production and exchange to be the property of the community as a whole, but under Syndicalism the control of conditions of work are to be in the hands of those who perform it."&lt;ref&gt;The Servile State, From the Freewoman, Reproduced in The Syndiacalist, London June 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Big Debate==
With the papers candid nature of expressing many of its beliefs, there were bound to be arguments. One of it biggest criticisms and continuous debates with some readers came from its stance on the suffrage movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delap|first=Lucy|title=The Freewoman's critque of the suffrage movement|page=617}}&lt;/ref&gt; It openly challenged the ideals of the movement and its organization. Despite being co-edited, these views were mainly the opinions of Marsden and not Gawthorpe. With the paper’s belief that feminism was more than just the right to vote, its views on the suffrage movement were unlike most feminists in Britain during the twentieth century. During this era women were fighting for the right to vote and to be regarded as political equals amongst men. Not all feminists believed in complete female independence from the strongholds of the normative female life. ''The Freewoman'' wanted to stray away from this concept of feminism. It wanted women to not only be politically equal, but economically and socially self-sufficient as well. It rooted its beliefs in complete female independence from the norms of society.

==The Closing Years==
The publication of ''The Freewoman'' did not last long. Its final paper was published in 1912, but was later revived in May 1913 with the new title ''The New Freewoman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Cary|title=Marketing Edwardian Feminism|page=632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the attempts to revive the paper and inspire more readers, the paper finally ended publication in 1914. Its publication did not reach a large market, mostly due to its views on feminism and the suffrage movement. The paper, but more specifically Dora Marsden’s beliefs and opinions were far too liberal and progressive for its early twentieth century audience. The audience was still rather conservative in their views. It would not be until the years of the Great War that women began to take small strides in some of the ideals that ''The Freewoman'' expressed. Despite having an extremely small circulation, the paper’s strong beliefs and opinions were widely known and debated against and provided the impetus for future feminist activists.

The Hawaii Project was founded in 2014 by Mark Watkins. Prior to The Hawaii Project, he was CEO and co-founder of [[Goby (search engine)]], a mobile recommendation engine for finding things to do, since acquired by Telenav. Prior to that, he was VP of Engineering for Endeca, a search company acquired by [[Oracle Corporation]] for $1.075B.&lt;ref name="oracle-acquisition"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/Boston/businessupdates/2011/10/oracle-buys-endeca/tHRB2UzIBhbhkB5V5RhrFN/index.html |title=Oracle buys Endeca |work=Boston.com |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2011-10-18 |last=Farrell |first=Michael B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the company was rooted in the founder's frustration at not finding out about new books from his favorite authors.&lt;ref name=bostinno&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/04/14/best-new-books-the-hawaii-project-tells-you-what-to-read/| title=This New Startup Hunts Down the Books You're Bound to Love| author=Rebecca Strong| date=14 April 2015| publisher=Bost Inno| accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8785">'''The Mbari Club''' was a centre for cultural activity by African writers, artists and musicians that was founded in [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]], in 1961 by [[Ulli Beier]], with the involvement of a group of young writers including [[Wole Soyinka]] and [[Chinua Achebe]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8508079/Ulli-Beier.html "Ulli Beier" (obituary)], ''[[Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 11 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mbari-Mbayo-Club "Mbari Mbayo Club"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mbari (art)|Mbari]]'', an [[Igbo language|Igbo]] concept related to "creation", was suggested as the name by Achebe.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;&lt;ref name=bookshy /&gt; Among other Mbari members were [[Christopher Okigbo]], [[J.

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in an obituary of Beier noted that "the Mbari Club became synonymous with the optimism and creative exuberance of Africa’s post-independence era. [[Fela Kuti]] made his debut as bandleader there, and it became a magnet for artists and writers from all over Africa, America and the Caribbean."&lt;ref name=Telegraph /&gt; In the words of Toyin Adepoju: "Coming to birth in the flux of the preindependence and immediate postindependence period in Nigeria, it brought together a constellation of artists whose work embodied the quality of transformation embodied by the aesthetic of creation, decay, and regeneration evoked by the Mbari tradition."&lt;ref name=Adepoju&gt;Toyin Adepoju, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nkVxNVvex-sC&amp;pg=PA665&amp;lpg=PA665&amp;dq=mbari+club+1961-&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=avMpHGiG_3&amp;sig=hNQYIXg-sskTOIq6wlV1XB5pihQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirprS83OvNAhXHKsAKHVK2AvwQ6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=mbari%20club%201961-&amp;f=false "Mbari Club"], in Carole Boyce Davies (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture: Origins, Experiences, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 665.&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely connected with the literary magazine ''[[Black Orpheus (magazine)|Black Orpheus]]'', which Beier had founded in 1957, Mbari also acted as a publisher during the 1960s — considered to be the only African-based publisher of African literature at the time — producing 17 titles by African writers.&lt;ref&gt;James Currey, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/reseafrilite.44.2.8?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents "Literary Publishing After Nigerian Independence: Mbari as Celebration"], ''Research in African Literatures'', Vol. 44, No. 2, (In)Visibility in African Cultures / Zoe Norridge, Charlotte Baker, and Elleke Boehmer, Guest Editors (Summer 2013), pp. 8–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Mbari published early works by Clark, Okigbo and Soyinka, poetry by [[Bakare Gbadamosi]] (''Okiri'', 1961), [[Alex La Guma]] (''A Walk in the Night and Other Stories'', 1962), [[Dennis Brutus]] (''Sirens, Knuckles, Boots'', 1963), [[Kofi Awoonor]] and [[Lenrie Peters]],&lt;ref name=Columbia /&gt; as well as translations of francophone poetry.&lt;ref name=bookshy /&gt; Brutus was chosen as winner of the Mbari Prize, awarded to a black poet of distinction, but turned it down on the grounds of its racial exclusivity.&lt;ref&gt;Josh MacPhee, [https://justseeds.org/242-mbari-publishing/ "242: Mbari Publishing"], ''Justseeds'', 20 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Brutus, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mpSqpLpvKcMC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Mbari+prize+&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xc8hf72JPU&amp;sig=CCSXqnTGthL_lRgo6ZrdD9jM1Lg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6qtWyhZbXAhUIY1AKHeVyC_UQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Mbari%20prize%20&amp;f=false ''The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography''] (edited by Bernth Lindfors), James Currey, 2011, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1961 by a diverse group of writers, visual artists, musicians and actors, and active throughout the 1960s, the Mbari Club was originally located in Ibadan's Dugbe Market, on the site of "an old Lebanese restaurant that was converted into an open-air performance venue, an art gallery, a library, and an office."&lt;ref name=bookshy /&gt; 

While celebrating the creativity of Nigerian talent in the [[History of Nigeria#Independence|newly independent nation]], Mbari "was an international environment, attracting artists from across Africa and beyond".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/century-city/century-city-lagos-1955-70 "Mbari writers and artists Club"], ''Century City: Lagos 1955–70'', Tate.&lt;/ref&gt; The premieres of Soyinka's ''The Trials of Brother Jero'' and Clark's ''Song of a Goat'' were staged at Mbari, and internationally renowned artists were also invited to play or exhibit their work, including [[Langston Hughes]], [[Jacob Lawrence]] and [[Pete Seeger]].&lt;ref name=Columbia /&gt; The club also initiated writing competitions.&lt;ref name=Adepoju /&gt;

As recalled by [[Lindsay Barrett]], secretary of the Mbari Club from 1966 to 1967: "We were in a historic, literary setting ... when [[Nigerian Civil War|the civil war]] [1967–70] broke out and disintegrated everything."&lt;ref&gt;Anote Ajeluorou, [http://www.nigerianbestforum.com/generaltopics/echoes-of-okigbos-poetic-legacy-at-ibadan-reading-tour/ "Echoes of Okigbo’s poetic legacy at Ibadan reading tour"], NBF Topics, 13 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mbari Mbayo===
In 1962 a similar club based on the same concepts, called '''Mbari Mbayo''' (the name this time reflecting a [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] phrase meaning: "Were I to see, I would rejoice" or "When we see it we shall be happy"),&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;&lt;ref name=Columbia /&gt; was developed in [[Oshogbo]] — about 50 miles northeast of Ibadan — by dramatist [[Duro Ladipo]] together with Beier and Mphahlele.&lt;ref name=bookshy /&gt; Ladipo converted his father's house into an art gallery and a theatre, where he produced his plays.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; Artists who emerged from the Mbari Mbayo Club in Oshogbo include [[Twins Seven Seven]] and [[Jimoh Buraimoh]].&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

===Mbari-Enugu===
The Mbari-Enugu Club of Eastern Nigeria was established in 1963 and like Mbari Mbayo was particularly a platform for sculpture, painting and literary performance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yYqYAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT45&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;dq=mbari+club+members&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c7N9enyDqR&amp;sig=UstZggNo8RuyVuiITZbmiSMBNgw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnvqyFs4LPAhVJKMAKHflOBbwQ6AEIbjAU#v=onepage&amp;q=mbari%20club%20members&amp;f=false "Common Objectives and Ambitions"] in D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5685">The '''Theatre of War Project''' is a theater company that performs for returning veterans.

==History==
The story of [[Philoctetes (Sophocles play)|Philoctetes]], dealing with the wounded man and the interwoven relationships with others, has been frequently noted. In 2005, [[Bryan Doerries]], writer and director, began a series of readings of the play in the [[New York City]] area. 
Noting the reactions of the audience to the reading, especially related to the reactions of audience members to the interaction of the suffering soldier and the conflicted caregiver. The project revolves around presenting such readings, especially to audiences of medical professionals and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/theatre-of-war-sophocles-message-for-american-veterans|title=Theatre of War: Sophocles’ Message for American Veterans|last=Wright|first=Robin|date=2016-09-12|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-12-12|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of readings were followed by a panel discussion about doctor-patient relationships, involving presenters in psychiatry, physicians, and military medical personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/theater-of-war/|title=Theater of War: Soldiers and Citizens Tour - National Council|website=www.thenationalcouncil.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=TKR_Archives&amp;Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentIDID=2674|title=About the Philoctetes Project, The Key Reporter (Phi Beta Kappa)|last=Doerries|first=Bryan|date=Spring 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129202142/http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=TKR_Archives|archivedate=2006-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has also been extended to training of medical students, such as a presentation also in 2007 to the first year medical class at [[Weill Medical College]] of [[Cornell University]], involving not only the students, but also faculty members. The presentation included a discussion of an actual case dealing with the patient-caregiver interactions that parallel the situation that Sophocles presented.

In 2008, at a conference dedicated to finding new ways to help [[US Marines]] recover from post-traumatic stress and other disorders after serving in [[Iraq]] or [[Afghanistan]], four New York actors presented a dramatic reading from ''Philoctetes'' and [[Ajax (Sophocles)|''Ajax'']]. The plays focused on physical and psychological wounds inflicted on the warrior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-combat15-2008aug15,0,6770815.story latimes.com] Story by Tony Perry, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/books/review/the-theater-of-war-by-bryan-doerries.html|title=‘The Theater of War,’ by Bryan Doerries|last=Shapiro|first=James|date=2015-10-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also presented plays such as: “[[Prometheus Bound]],”, and “[[Women of Trachis|The Women of Trachis]]”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The phrase "'''What would Jesus do?'''" (often abbreviated to '''WWJD''') became popular, particularly in the United States but elsewhere as well, in the 1990s and as a personal [[motto]] for adherents of [[Christianity]] who used the phrase as a reminder of their belief in a [[moral imperative]] to act in a manner that would demonstrate the love of Jesus through the actions of the adherents.&lt;ref name=BBCnews&gt;{{cite web|title=What would Jesus do?: The rise of a slogan|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16068178|website=www.bbc.com/news/|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HelmekeSori2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helmeke|first1=Karen B.|last2=Sori|first2=Catherine Ford|title=The Therapist's Notebook for Integrating Spirituality in Counseling I|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Routledge|language=English|isbn=9781135884710|page=150|quote=In recent years, largely among Protestant and Catholic circles, the catch phrase "What Would Jesus Do" has become popular. The phrase is an attempt to call people to consider how Jesus Christ might respond to personal situations in daily life. While the idea of thinking about Jesus Christ might respond in a given situation is not new, the popularity of the catch-phrase "What Would Jesus Do?" or WWJD, has increased. Bracelets, keychains, T-shirts, bumper stickers, and other items initialized with WWJD have become commonplace.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular consciousness, the acronym signifying the question—WWJD—is associated with a type of bracelet or wristband which became a popular accessory for members of Christian youth groups, both Catholic and Protestant, in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=BBCnews/&gt;&lt;ref name="HelmekeSori2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWJD What Would Jesus Do Bracelets|url=http://www.mortaljourney.com/2010/11/1990-trends/wwjd-bracelets|publisher=Mortal Journey|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] emphasizes the concept of ''Imitatio Christi'' ([[imitation of Christ]]), which is summarized well in the English phrase "What Would Jesus Do?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2011/02/what_would_jesu.html|title="What Would Jesus Do?": A History|last=Rothman|first=Josh|date=8 February 2011|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]|language=English|accessdate=27 December 2016|quote="What would Jesus do?" has its roots, Shore explains, in the tradition of imitatio Christi - that is, of imitating the life of Christ. In this tradition, which dates back to early Christianity, a true believer might imitate Jesus by giving to the needy, traveling to the Holy Land, or, in the case of Saint Francis of Assisi, "receiving the stigmata, the bodily marks of Christ's suffering." Imitatio Christi encouraged Christians to "do as Jesus did."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wesley]], the founder of the [[Methodist Church]], in 1766 postulated the concept of [[Christian perfection]], a moment in the life of a Christian at which the [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] effectuated by the [[Holy Spirit]] results in a "perfection in love" which means that at least at that moment one is being motivated wholly by [[Great Commandment|love of God and neighbor]], with no taint of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] or ulterior motives in effect. While such Christian perfection is expressed in outward action, it is also the effect of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]]. Indeed, Wesley could speak of [[sanctification]] by faith as an analogous doctrine to the more widely held belief in [[justification by faith]]. Because Christian perfection is also visible in outward [[good works]] and a rigorously moral lifestyle, adherents of the [[Holiness movement]] assumed that a perfectly moral lifestyle is a consequence (not the cause) of the [[State (theology)|state of grace]] and ultimate [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]].

===Earlier appearances of the term, 1420s–1891===
[[Charles Spurgeon]], a well-known evangelical preacher in London, used the phrase "what would Jesus do" in quotation marks several times in a sermon he gave on June 28, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Sermon no. 2210. Spurgeon.org {{cite web|last1=Spurgeon|first1=Charles|title=The Agreement of Walking by Faith|url=https://archive.spurgeon.org/sermons/2210.php|website=Spurgeon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his sermon he cites the source of the phrase as a book written in Latin by [[Thomas à Kempis]] between 1418 and 1427, ''Imitatio Christi'' (The Imitation of Christ).

===1896 novel===
[[Charles Sheldon]]'s 1896 book ''[[In His Steps]]''  was subtitled "What Would Jesus Do?"&lt;ref name=BBCnews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon, C. (1896). [http://www.jr-miller.com/other/sheldon/in-his-steps.html ''In His Steps''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107084725/http://www.jr-miller.com/other/sheldon/in-his-steps.html |date=2012-11-07 }}. First published by the ''Chicago Advance'' in serial form.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sheldon's novel grew out of a series of sermons he delivered in his [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] church in [[Topeka, Kansas]]. Unlike the previous nuances mentioned above, Sheldon's theology was shaped by a commitment to [[Christian Socialism]]. The [[ethos]] of Sheldon's approach to the [[Christian]] life was expressed in this phrase "What Would Jesus Do", with Jesus being a moral example as well as  a Saviour figure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kshs.org/research/collections/documents/personalpapers/findingaids/sheldon_charles.htm Charles Monroe Sheldon/Central Congregational Church Collection, 1811-1984].&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon's ideas coalesced with those that formed into the [[Social Gospel]] espoused by [[Walter Rauschenbusch]]. Indeed, Rauschenbusch acknowledged that his Social Gospel owed its inspiration directly to Sheldon's novel,&lt;ref name=FloridaCara&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Burnidge |first=Cara L. |date=Spring 2009 |title=Charles M. Sheldon and the Heart of the Social Gospel Movement |type=M.A. |publisher=Florida State University |url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:180988/datastream/PDF/view |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110154107/http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:180988/datastream/PDF/view |archive-date=November 10, 2016 |dead-url=no |access-date=June 2, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sheldon himself identified his own [[theology]] with the Social Gospel.&lt;ref name=FloridaCara/&gt;

Due to a mistake by the original publisher, the copyright for Sheldon's novel was never established and multiple publishers were able to print and sell the novel. This caused the novel to be easily affordable and it sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the top 50 bestselling novels ever.&lt;ref name=BBCnews/&gt;

In this popular novel (it had been translated into 21 [[language]]s by 1935), Rev. Henry Maxwell encounters a [[homelessness|homeless]] man who challenges him to take seriously the imitation of [[Jesus|Christ]]. The homeless man has difficulty understanding why, in his view, so many Christians ignore the poor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I heard some people singing at a church prayer meeting the other night,

"All for Jesus, all for Jesus,
All my being's ransomed powers,
All my thoughts, and all my doings,
All my days, and all my hours."

and I kept wondering as I sat on the steps outside just what they meant by it. It seems to me there's an awful lot of trouble in the world that somehow wouldn't exist if all the people who sing such songs went and lived them out. I suppose I don't understand. But what would Jesus do? Is that what you mean by following His steps? It seems to me sometimes as if the people in the big churches had good clothes and nice houses to live in, and money to spend for luxuries, and could go away on summer vacations and all that, while the people outside the churches, thousands of them, I mean, die in tenements, and walk the streets for jobs, and never have a piano or a picture in the house, and grow up in misery and drunkenness and sin."&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon, C. (1896) ''In His Steps,'' p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This leads to many of the novel's characters asking, "What would Jesus do?" when faced with decisions of some importance. This has the effect of making the characters embrace Christianity more seriously and to focus on what they see as its core &amp;mdash; the life of Christ.

In 1993, Garrett W. Sheldon (great-grandson of the original author) and Deborah Morris published ''What Would Jesus Do? : a contemporary retelling of Charles M. Sheldon's classic In His Steps''. Garrett Sheldon states that his updated version "is based on many actual events in the lives of believers."&lt;ref&gt;Garrett W. Sheldon with Deborah Morris, ''What Would Jesus Do? : a contemporary retelling of Charles M. Sheldon's classic In His Steps'' (1993), p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that Sheldon was familiar with either Spurgeon or Thomas, or that he was independently inspired.

===1990s===
A youth group leader at Calvary Reformed Church&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16068178|title=What would Jesus do?: The rise of a slogan|date=2011-12-08|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Holland, Michigan]], named Janie Tinklenberg, began a [[grassroots]] movement to help the teenagers in her group remember the phrase; it spread worldwide in the 1990s among Christian youth, who wore bracelets bearing the initials WWJD.&lt;ref name=BBCnews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/business/feature/2000/10/25/wwjd/print.html Salon.com Business | What would Jesus do - about copyright?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031031152724/http://archive.salon.com/business/feature/2000/10/25/wwjd/print.html |date=2003-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/tc/storiesofhope/sharingthefaith/8r3047.html What Would Jesus Do? - by Sandy Sheppard]. Christianitytoday.com. Retrieved on 2012-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, a sequel bracelet was generated with the initials "FROG," to provide an answer to "WWJD."  FROG was an acronym for "Fully Rely On God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FROG bracelets answer WWJD question|journal=Pentecostal Evangel|date=1999|issue=4417–4442|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
In 2005, Garry Wills wrote "What Jesus Meant", in which he examined "What Would Jesus Really Do" (also a book review in ''[[Esquire Magazine]]'').

===2010===
In April 2010 a film, ''WWJD'', starring [[Adam Gregory]] and based on ''In His Steps'' by Charles Sheldon, was released on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Would Jesus Do?|url=https://www.amazon.com/What-Would-Jesus-John-Schneider/dp/B003UCA4XI|website=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 31 March 2015 a sequel film was released ''WWJD What Would Jesus Do? The Journey Continues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWJD What Would Jesus Do? The Journey Continues (2015)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4123718/|website=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second film using the moniker ''WWJD II'' was ''The Woodcarver'' which was released in 2012. It has a similar theme but different characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Woodcarver (2015)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2047890/|website=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parodies==
The expression has become a [[snowclone]], sometimes for humorous effect. For example, ''[[What Would Jesus Buy?]]'', "What Would [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] Do?", "[[What Would Brian Boitano Do?]]", "What Would [[Mary Marvel]] Do?", "What Would [[Johnny Cash]] Do?", and "What would [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] do?".&lt;ref&gt;A small book investigating Tintin as a role model for young people. http://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/title/2796&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management and leadership==

The term "What Would Jesus Do?" or "WWJD" is also perceived as a fundamental management and leadership principle given Jesus' methodology of going to the marketplace to preach and lead by example. In modern management principles, more academic and professional references are going to the [[gemba]] or [[Management by Walking Around]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e.globis.jp/article/000240.html|title=MBA Buzz: Pope Francis and the Rebuilding of the Catholic Culture |accessdate=2013-06-11 |author=King del Rosario |last= |first= |authorlink= |date= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
