{{History of Bahrain}}

The '''1990s uprising in Bahrain''' ({{lang-ar|الانتفاضة التسعينية في البحرين}}) also known as the '''uprising of dignity'''&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"&gt;{{cite news| title=Sheikh Abdul Amir al-Jamri |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 December 2006 |accessdate=5 June 2013| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/dec/20/guardianobituaries.world |author=Phil Davison}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ar|انتفاضة الكرامة}}) was an [[rebellion|uprising]] in [[Bahrain]] between 1994 and 1999 in which [[left-wing politics|leftists]], [[liberalism|liberals]] and [[Islamism|Islamists]] joined forces to demand democratic reforms. The uprising caused approximately forty deaths and ended after [[Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa]] became the Emir of Bahrain in 1999&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acrli.org/countryprofiles/bahrain.html "Country Profiles Bahrain"] The Arab Center for the Development of the Rule of Law and Integrity Retrieved 2010-12-01&lt;/ref&gt; and a referendum on 14–15 February 2001 massively supported the [[National Action Charter of Bahrain|National Action Charter]].&lt;ref name="UNDP-POGAR" /&gt; The uprising resulted in the deaths of around 40 civilians and at least one Bahraini soldier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bna.bh/portal/news/453883 "التحالف الوطني ضد الإرهاب يزور أسر شهداء الواجب"].

==Background==
[[File:Essa bin Salman Al-Khalifa 1998.jpg|thumb|upright|The Amir, [[Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa]] dissolved the parliament and suspended the constitution in 1975.]]

In 1971, Bahrain became independent from Britain and in 1973 the country had its first [[Bahraini parliamentary election, 1973|parliamentary election]]. However, two years later the constitution was suspended and the assembly dissolved by the Amir, [[Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa|Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa]] after it rejected the [[State Security Law in Bahrain|State Security Law]]. The act also known as "the precautionary law" was proposed by [[Ian Henderson (police officer)|Ian Henderson]]. It gave police wide arresting powers and allowed individuals to be held in prison without trial or charge for up to three years for mere suspicion "that they might be a threat to the state". Starting in August 1975, widespread arrests were conducted including members of the dissolved parliament. The "ruthless system of repression" launched by Henderson lasted for over twenty five years. Repeated allegations of systematic torture, arbitrary arrests of thousands and assassinations made by opposition activists and human rights groups were denied by Henderson who said he "has never been involved in torture nor has he ever ordered his officers to torture those who have been arrested".&lt;ref name="BBC 11.5.2012"&gt;[[Adam Curtis]] (11 May 2012). [http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/2012/05/if_you_take_my_advice_-_id_rep.html "If you take my advice - I'd repress them"]. [[BBC News]]. Retrieved 27 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, a petition signed by 280 society leaders, including some of the dissolved parliament members called for the restoration of the national assembly. Initially, the government set up a thirty-member appointed "Shura council" assigned with "commenting" on government proposed legislation. Another petition the following month concluded that the newly formed council "does not replace the national assembly as a constitutional and legislative authority". A delegation of six members, half Sunnis and half Shias representing petition organizers met with the Amir who told them Shura council "was all [they] could expect".&lt;ref name="HRW report"&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/45cafc9e2.html "Routine Abuse, Routine Denial: Civil Rights and the Political Crisis in Bahrain"]. [[Human Rights Watch]]. [[UNHCR]]. 1 January 2006. Retrieved 19 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amnesty95&gt;{{cite news|title=Bahrain: A Human Rights Crisis|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde11/016/1995/en/|newspaper=[[Amnesty International]]|date=25 Sep 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
Like other uprisings during the 1990s, the uprising's stated aims were for democratic reform, and it was considered as the first movement in the Arab world where [[left-wing politics|leftists]], [[liberalism|liberals]] and [[Islamism|Islamists]] joined forces on a common ground calling for restoration of the dissolved parliament and suspended constitution.

Although attempts were made to portray a totalitarian nature of an Islamic fundamentalist ideology, the events and the moderate discourse of their leaders attracted support from all human rights organizations (such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Article 19]], UN Human Rights Sub-Commission, etc.) as well as from members of parliament in the UK, France, USA and the EU. The final aim of the uprising was the reinstatement of the [[1973 Constitution of Bahrain|1973 constitution]] and respect of human rights in Bahrain, while preserving plurality of opinions in society.

==Main events==
The uprising began in June 1994, with a picket by unemployed people in front of the ministry of labour. Over 1,500 demonstrator tried to organize a sit-in front of Ministry of Labor protesting the increasing rate of unemployment which had reached 15 percent. Riot police dispersed them using tear gas. Similar incidents occurred in August and September. Another petition was launched, this time it was open to all citizens. Organizers said they collected over 20,000 signatures most of whom were Shia.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt;

In November, hundreds of Shia protested against a charity marathon. The route of the marathon was through some Shia villages, who considered the female dressings offensive. Reportedly, some protesters threw stones on the marathon, which prompted security forces to conduct a number of arrests. The following month [[Ali Salman]], a protest leader, was arrested after being accused of inciting the incident. The arrest sparked further protests and violence in Manama and [[Sitra]]. Some protesters used Molotov cocktails to attack "police stations, banks and commercial properties". On the other hand, riot police used tear and rubber bullets, sometimes "fired at street level and from helicopters". It was also reported that police used live ammunition on some occasions.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt;

By December, the number of detainees was between 500 and 600 according to the US Embassy. A number of opposition leaders, including Ali Salman were exiled in January 1995. Protests and arrests continued amid some government statements of releasing prisoners. In February the government said only 300 remain in prison, while activists said the number was as high as 2000. The level of violence and arrests increased again in March and April. [[Abdul Amir al-Jamri]], the leader of the uprising was arrested on 1 April along with other protest leaders such as [[Abdulwahab Hussain]] and [[Hassan Mushaima]].&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt;

One month after their arrest, the government started jailhouse negotiations with opposition leaders. About twenty one-or-two-hour meetings were conducted in four months between activists one side and Henderson, his deputy; [[Adel Flaifel]] or [[Ministry of Interior (Bahrain)|Minister of Interior]] on the other side.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt; An agreement named "the Initiative"&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 30.4.2005"&gt;{{ar icon}} [http://www.alwasatnews.com/967/news/read/460775/1.html "عبدالوهاب حسين"]. ''[[Al-Wasat (Bahraini newspaper)|Al Wasat]]''. 30 April 2005. Retrieved 23 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; was reached in which opposition leaders would calm people in exchange for releasing all of those not convicted in courts. The government reportedly agreed that at a later stage after establishment of security, it would start a political dialogue with opposition. Initially, protests paused, however they resumed after the government denied such an agreement existed.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt;

In December 1995 and January 1996, two bombs exploded in a shopping mall and a hotel without causing any casualties. Opposition leaders were arrested. No charges were filed against them (as of May 2007). Bombings continued in the following months collecting the lives of eight people. The number of deaths by this time reached twenty four, including several deaths while in police custody due to alleged torture as well as three security forces. In May, a protester was sentenced to death penalty for allegedly killing a policeman. During this period, arrests increased, especially among women and children.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt;

In June, the government said it had detected a network called the "military wing of Hizb AllahBahrain". The government alleged it was backed by Iran and had caused the unrest. The claim that "Hizb Allah" existed in Bahrain was described by [[Human Rights Watch]] as lacking any credibility, however the report noted the influence of Iran during that period.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt;

The uprising was characterized by extreme forms of suppression, riots, stoning and bomb attacks. Over forty people were killed, mostly by the security forces. Most of the events of the uprising took place in Shia villages and towns; there was a strong religious component in the violence. The rhetoric of the pro-government quarters attempted to stain the image of the uprising, but at the end, the situation had to improve following the longest ever uprising in the history of Bahrain.

==Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and the National Action Charter==
The violence generally subsided after King [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]] carried out political reforms after he ascended to the throne in 1999. On 14 and 15 February 2001, the [[National Action Charter of Bahrain|National Action Charter]] was overwhelmingly approved by Bahrainis, with 98.4% in favour.&lt;ref name="UNDP-POGAR"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Country Theme: Elections: Bahrain|work=|publisher=[[United Nations Development Program|UNDP]]-Programme on Governance in the Arab Region|year=2011|url=http://www.pogar.org/countries/theme.aspx?t=3&amp;cid=2|format=|doi=|accessdate=2011-02-09|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wNSNDw42?url=http://www.pogar.org/countries/theme.aspx?t=3&amp;cid=2|archivedate=2011-02-09|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resurrection of Jesus: 1–11==
The chapter begins with the statement of the Good News, received by Paul from the ascended Jesus Christ. Paul reveals the significance of the death, burial, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ and that if we believe this message that we are saved. The account of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] appearances of Jesus in verses 3–7 appears to be an early pre-Pauline [[creed|creedal statement]].&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld, ''The Earliest Christian Confessions'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1964) p. 47; Reginald Fuller, ''The Formation of the Resurrection Narratives'' (New York: Macmillan, 1971) p. 10 ({{ISBN|0281024758}}); Wolfhart Pannenberg, ''Jesus – God and Man'' translated Lewis Wilkins and Duane Pribe (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1968) p. 90 ({{ISBN|0664208185}}); Oscar Cullmann, ''The Early Church: Studies in Early Christian History and Theology'', ed.

The antiquity of the creed has been located by most biblical scholars to no more than five years after Jesus' death, probably originating from the Jerusalem apostolic community.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfhart Pannenberg, ''Jesus – God and Man'' translated Lewis Wilkins and Duane Pribe (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1968) p. 90 ({{ISBN|0664208185}}); Oscar Cullmann, ''The Early church: Studies in Early Christian History and Theology'', ed.

In dissent from the majority view, [[Robert M. Price]] and Hermann Detering, writing in the [[Journal of Higher Criticism]] (edited by Price) argued that 1 Corinthians 15:3–7 was not an early Christian creed written within five years of Jesus' death. Price &lt;ref name=price1995&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://depts.drew.edu/jhc/rp1cor15.html |title=Apocryphal Apparitions: 1 Corinthians 15:3–11 as a Post-Pauline Interpolation |first=Robert M |last=Price |authorlink=Robert M. Price |year=1995 |journal=Journal of Higher Criticism |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=69–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Detering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Falsified Paul|page=3|author=Herman Detering}}&lt;/ref&gt; denied that Paul wrote the verses and believed they were an [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|Interpolation]] possibly dating to as far back as the beginning of the 2nd century. Price said that "The pair of words in verse 3a, "received / delivered" (''paralambanein'' / ''paradidonai'') is, as has often been pointed out, technical language for the handing on of rabbinical tradition". According to Price, this (supposedly interpolated) text contradicts Paul's tale of conversion described in Galatians 1:13–24 which explicitly denies that Paul had been taught the gospel of Christ by any man, but rather by Jesus himself.&lt;ref name=price1995 /&gt; However, many commentators have the view that Paul "received" this from Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible]]|author1=[[Robert Jamieson (minister)|Robert Jamieson]]|author2=[[A. R. Fausset]]|author3=[[David Brown (Free Church of Scotland)|David Brown]]|year=1871}}&lt;/ref&gt; They point to 1 Cor. 11:23 as evidence of this idea.&lt;ref&gt;''Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible'' (1871), commentary on 1 Corinthians 15:3.&lt;/ref&gt; "For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread..." (1 Corinthians 11:23, (KJV) ) The Greek words for "received / delivered" are the same here as in 1 Corinthians 15:3.

Against these scholars, [[Geza Vermes]] defends the majority view in ''The Resurrection''. Vermes says that the words of Paul are "a tradition he has inherited from his seniors in the faith concerning the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus".&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes (2008) ''The Resurrection''. London, Penguin: 121–2 ({{ISBN|0739499696}}; {{ISBN|978-0141030050}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary R. Habermas]] argues, "Essentially all critical scholars today agree that in Corinthians 15:3–8, Paul records an ancient oral tradition(s) that summarizes the content of the Christian gospel,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=To Everyone an Answer: A Case for the Christian Worldview |editor1=[[Francis J. Beckwith]] |editor2=[[William Lane Craig]] |editor3=[[J. P. Moreland]] |publisher=InterVarsity Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0830877508 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Paul "uses the explicit language of oral transmission," according to [[Donald Hagner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Testament: A Historical and Theological Introduction |chapter=Part 2.7.

According to Paul's [[Epistle to the Galatians]] he had previously met two of the people mentioned in these verses as witnesses of the resurrection: [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]] and [[Saint Peter|Cephas/Peter]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days. I saw none of the other apostles – only James, the Lord's brother. I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie. ({{bibleref2|Galatians|1:18–20}})&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, even skeptical scholars agree that the creed in 1 Corinthians 15 is not an interpolation but was a creed formulated and taught at a very early date after Jesus' death. [[Gerd Lüdemann]], a skeptic scholar, maintains that "the elements in the tradition are to be dated to the first two years after the crucifixion of Jesus... not later than three years..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Resurrection of Jesus|author=Gerd Lüdemann|year=1994|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Goulder]], another skeptic scholar, states that it "goes back at least to what Paul was taught when he was converted, a couple of years after the crucifixion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Baseless Fabric of a Vision (as quoted in Gavin D'Costa's Resurrection Reconsidered, p. 48)|author=Michael Goulder|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verse 5===
: ''And that he was seen of Cephas, then of [[Twelve apostles|the twelve]]:''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:5|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verse 6===
: ''After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep.''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:6|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verse 7===
: ''After that He was seen by James, then by all the apostles.''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:7|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was probably [[James, brother of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/15.htm Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary on 1 Corinthians 15], accessed 11 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verse 8===
: ''Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time.''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:8|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verse 9 ===
: ''For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:9|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resurrection of the dead: 12–58==

===Jesus and the believers 12–19===
In verses 12–19, St Paul, in response to some expressed doubts of the Corinthian congregation, whom he is addressing in the letter, adduces the fundamental importance of the [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrection]] as a Christian doctrine. Through those verses, Paul is stressing the importance of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and its relevance to the core of Christianity. Paul rebukes the Corinth Church by saying if Jesus did not resurrect after the crucifixion, then there is no point in the Christianity faith (1 Cor 15:12–19 ESV).

=== Verse 17 ===
: ''And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:17|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verses 20–28: the last enemy===
In verses 20–28, Paul states that [[Second Coming|Christ will return in power]] and put his "enemies under his feet" (25) and even death, "the last enemy", shall be destroyed:
: ''The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:26|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verse 29: baptism for the dead===
: ''Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:29|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In verse 29 Paul notes that at Corinth there existed a practice whereby a living person would be [[Baptism for the dead|baptized]] instead of some convert who had recently died. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]] interpret this passage to support their practice of [[Baptism for the dead]]. This principle of vicarious work for the dead is an important work of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in the [[dispensation of the fulness of times]]. This interpretation is rejected by all other [[denominations of Christianity]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Teignmouth Shore, writing in [[Charles Ellicott|Ellicott]]'s ''Commentary for Modern Readers'', notes that "there have been numerous and ingenious conjectures as to the meaning of this passage. The only tenable interpretation is that there existed amongst some of the Christians at Corinth a practice of baptising a living person in the stead of some convert who had died before that sacrament had been administered to him. Such a practice existed amongst the [[Marcionites]] in the second century, and still earlier amongst a sect called the Corinthians."&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/1_corinthians/15.htm Ellicott's Commentary for Modern Readers on 1 Corinthians 15], accessed 12 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jerusalem Bible]] states that "What this practice was is unknown. Paul does not say if he of approved it or not: he uses it merely for an ''ad hominem'' argument".&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Bible (1966), note at 1 Corinthians 15:29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resurrection of the body: 35–58===
[[File:B Facundus 167.jpg|thumb|'''The Last Trump''', illumination by Facundus, 1047. Madrid, [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]].]]
The chapter concludes with an account of the nature of the resurrection. At the [[Last Judgement]] the dead will be raised and both the living and the dead transformed into "spiritual bodies" (44):&lt;ref&gt;E.P. Sanders (1991) ''Paul''. Oxford University Press: 29–30 ({{ISBN|0192876791}}).

Through the power of Christ "Death is swallowed up in victory" (54). Referencing a verse in [[Hosea]], Paul asks: "O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy victory?" (55), equating sin with death and the [[Torah|Judaic Law]] which have now been conquered and superseded by the victory of Christ.

Verses 3–5 (plus possible additional verses) may be  one of the earliest [[creed]]s about Jesus' death and resurrection.

'''Abraham of Paleostrov''' ({{lang-ru|Авраамий Палеостровский}} - '''Avraamy Paleostrovsky'''; died c. 1460), '''Avraamy Olonetsky''' is a [[List of Russian saints (until 15th century)|saint in the Russian Orthodox Church]], a [[hegumen]] of [[Nativity of Mary|Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] monastery in Paleostrov. Abraham was a disciple of [[Cornelius of Paleostrov]] and one of his successors as [[abbot]] of his monastery.

==Life and ministration==
From the ''Legend of the Life of the Reverend Cornelius of Paleostrov'', it is known that Abraham came to Cornelius after he had settled in a cave on the island of Paley on [[Lake Onega]]. The Paleostrovsky Monastery was founded by Cornelius, presumably no later than 1415-1421. Abraham together with other disciples of Cornelius participated in the construction of the churches of the [[Nativity of Mary|Nativity of the Blessed Virgin]], of [[Elijah|Elijah the Prophet]] and [[Saint Nicholas|Nikolaos the Wonderworker]], the caves for the monks. In the lifetime of Cornelius he appointed Abraham as his successor. The Venerable Cornelius died about 1420, Abraham buried him in the cave of the island of Paley. [[The Reverend]] Cornelius died about 1420, Abraham buried him in the cave of the island of Paley. Later, the relics of Cornelius Paleostrovsky were transferred to the Church of [[Nativity of Mary|Nativity of the Blessed Virgin]]. The Monk Abraham died in the middle of the 15th century. He was buried in the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin near Cornelius.&lt;ref name="pravenc"/&gt;

==Veneration==
The date of the local canonization of Abraham Paleostrovsky is unknown. In the XVII century, the Palaeostrovsky Monastery was twice devastated, as a result of which most of the archive was lost. The local veneration of Abraham and Cornelius was documented at the beginning of the 19th century. Archbishop Sergius (Spassky) assigned the feast day of both saints - August 21. In 1974, Abraham Paleostrovsky was included in the Synaxis of the 
[[Karelia]]n Saints, and in 1981 - in the Synaxis of the [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]] Saints.&lt;ref name="pravenc"&gt;[http://www.pravenc.ru/text/73419.html/ АВРААМИЙ ПАЛЕОСТРОВСКИЙ] Retrieved on 12 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[feast day]] is celebrated on August 21 in the Russian church.&lt;ref name="Synaxis of All Saints of Karelia"&gt;Synaxis of All Saints of Karelia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Synaxis of All Saints of Novgorod&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravenc.ru/text/73419.html|script-title=ru:Авраамий Палеостровский|trans-title=Eleazar, Nazarius and Eumenius|publisher=Православная Энциклопедиа (The Orthodox Encyclopedia)|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agni Yoga''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Агни Йога'') or the '''Living Ethics''' (Russian: ''Жива́я Этика''), or the '''Teaching of Life''' (Russian: ''Учение Жизни'') is a one of the [[Neo-Theosophy|neo-theosophical]] [[religious doctrine]] transmitted by the [[Helena Roerich]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]] from 1920. The term ''Agni Yoga'' means “Mergence with Divine Fire” or “Path to Mergence with Divine Fire”. This term was introduced by the Roerichs. The followers of Agni Yoga believe that the teaching was given to the Roerich family and their associates by [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|Master]] [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]], the [[guru]] of Roerichs and [[Helena Blavatsky]], one of the founders of the modern theosophical movement and the [[Theosophical Society]]. 

Agni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the [[yoga]] of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the [[planetary consciousness]] is a pressing necessity and that, through [[Individual#Buddhism|individual]] striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. According to Helena Roerich, Agni Yoga is the [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] of all [[yoga]]s. In all the [[List of Hindu texts|ancient Hindu scriptures]], the approaching Fiery Age was predicted. Agni-Fire, which to a varying degree is at the heart of all the yogas, will extremely sate the atmosphere of our planet, and all the branches of Yoga will be merged into a fiery synthesis. Agni Yoga is a fire [[baptism]].

The most significant features of Agni Yoga are cosmism and [[universalism]]. They are expressed in the interpretation of any phenomena of human existence from the point of view of their cosmic significance and interrelation with the being of the [[Universe]].

Agni Yoga played a significant role in bringing knowledge of [[Asian religions]] to [[Western world]]. Living Ethics has an international following and  has thousands of adherents. The ideas of Teaching of Life have exerted an influence on another [[esoteric]] movements and philosophies, among them the [[New Age]] and [[Transhumanism]].

===Etymology and concept===
The term ''Agni Yoga'' means “Mergence with Divine Fire” or “Path to Mergence with Divine Fire”. This term was introduced to the western public by the [[Nicholas Roerich]] and [[Helena Roerich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highest-yoga.info/en/yoga/agni-yoga.html |title=Agni Yoga |publisher=highest-yoga.info |accessdate=21 November 2018 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/746J1WitJ |archivedate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Agni]]'' ({{lang-sa|अग्नि}}) is the [[Vedas|Vedic]] and Living Ethics ''God of Fire'', one marks immortality and the symbol of life. Agni is one of the supreme gods in the [[Rigveda]]. In Agni Yoga it is the Creative Fire of the Universe, the root of  the "Fire of Space"; and "psychic energy", the powers of the human mind and heart, particularly those manifesting in love, thought, and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/world-religions/oclc/659908115?ht=edition&amp;referer=null |author=[[John Bowker (theologian)|Bowker, John]] |title=World Religions |publisher=New York: DK Publishing, Inc. |accessdate=10 September 2018 |year=1997 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6wJMDtNzh?url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/world-religions/oclc/659908115?ht=edition&amp;referer=null |archivedate=8 January 2018 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin myth found in many [[Indo-European culture]]s Agni is a bird like being, that brings fire from the gods to mankind. Alternatively, this messenger brings an elixir of immortality from heaven to [[Earth]]. In the early [[Vedic literature]], Agni primarily connotes the fire as a god, one reflecting the primordial powers to consume, transform and convey.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p15"&gt;{{cite book |author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell |title=Vedic Mythology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC |year=1898 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1113-3 |pages=15–16, 92–93 |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Yoga]]'' ({{lang-sa|योग}}; {{pronunciation|Yoga pronunciation.ogg |help=no}}) is one of the six orthodox schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. Yoga is a group of [[soul|spiritual]], [[mind|mental]], and [[Human body|physical]] practices or disciplines which originated in [[ancient India]]. The term ''Yoga'' has been applied to a variety of practices and methods. In Hinduism these include [[Jnana yoga|Jnana Yoga]], [[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti Yoga]], [[Karma yoga|Karma Yoga]], [[Laya yoga|Laya Yoga]] and [[Hatha yoga|Hatha Yoga]]. The term ''[[Rāja yoga]]'' originally referred to the ultimate goal of yoga, which is [[Samadhi]] ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|समाधि}}, {{IPA-hns|səˈmaːdʱi|hi}}), but was popularised by [[Swami Vivekananda]] as the common name for ''Ashtanga Yoga''. In the Ashtanga Yoga tradition, ''Samadhi'' is the eighth and final limb identified in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]].&lt;ref name="Feuerstein2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Georg Feuerstein]] |title=The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cI5XDwAAQBAJ |date=23 October 2012 |publisher=Hohm Press |isbn=978-1-935387-39-8 |page=37 |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yogadarsanabook3&gt;{{cite book |url=

As celestial mother of every existing form and being, the synthesis of all things, she is associated with space and with mystic speech.

''[[Karma]]'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑr|m|ə}}; {{lang-sa|कर्म|karma}}, {{IPA-sa|ˈkərmə|IPA|Karma.ogg}}) means action, work or deed. It also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual influence his future. Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and future suffering. With origins in [[History of India|ancient India]]'s [[Vedic civilization]], the philosophy of karma is closely associated with the idea of [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] in many schools of [[Indian religions]], particularly [[Karma in Hinduism|Hinduism]], [[Karma in Buddhism|Buddhism]], [[Karma in Jainism|Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Parvesh Singla |title=The Manual of Life – Karma |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mXR35jX-TsC&amp;pg=PP5 |publisher=books.google.com |pages=5–7 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karma works as one of the great principles of Cosmic Action.

''[[Spiritual evolution]]'' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]], [[theology|theological]], [[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric]] or [[Spirituality|spiritual]] idea that nature and human beings and [[human culture]] evolve: either extending from an established [[esoteric cosmology|cosmological]] [[pattern]] (ascent), or in accordance with certain pre-established potentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube |GbWMw249xY8 |The Hidden History of Humanity}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "spiritual evolution" can occur in the context of ''higher evolution'', a term used to differentiate psychological, mental, or spiritual evolution from the ''lower evolution'' or [[biological evolution]] of physical form.&lt;ref&gt;

The most significant features of Agni Yoga are cosmism and universalism.

====Theosophy====
{{Main|Theosophy (Blavatskian)}}

The [[Theosophical Society]] was officially formed in [[New York City]] on 17 November 1875 by [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Henry Steel Olcott]], [[William Quan Judge]], and others. It was self-described as "an unsectarian body of seekers after Truth, who endeavour to promote Brotherhood and strive to serve humanity." After a few years Olcott and Blavatsky moved to India and established the International Headquarters at [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Adyar]], in [[Chennai|Madras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.de/books/about/The_Theosophical_Movement.html?id=OC4IAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |year=1951 |title=The Theosophical Movement 1875–1950 |publisher=Cunningham Press |location=Los Angeles |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Madame Blavatsky (''Upasica'' - this spiritual name means a female lay disciple. So the ''Teachers'' called [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky|HPB]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Theosophy and culture: Nicholas Roerich |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AdpG8sGt8K8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author=Stasulane, Anita |publisher=Gregorian Biblical BookShop |location=Rome |volume=8 |year=2005 |page=26-27 |isbn=978-88-7839-035-5 |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the greatest [[occultist]] in the history of [[Western civilization]], insisted that [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] is not a [[religion]], although did refer to it as the modern transmission of the "once universal religion" that she claimed had existed deep into the human past. The motto of the Theosophical movement: '''There is no Religion higher than Truth'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ultindia.org/tm_magazine/TMOct2018.pdf |title=The motto is located at the top of the magazine page |journal=The Theosophical Movement.

Theosophical organisations, regard it as a system that embraces what they see as the "essential truth" underlying religion, philosophy, and science. Theosophical groups allow their members to hold other religious allegiances, resulting in [[Theosophists]] who also identify as [[Christians]], [[Buddhists]], or [[Hindus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ru/books/about/Is_Theosophy_a_Religion.html?id=2Kd5ngEACAAJ&amp;source=kp_cover&amp;redir_esc=y |last=Blavatsky |first=Helena |year=2013 |title=Is Theosophy a Religion? |pages=24 |isbn=9781258977719 |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Neo-Theosophy]] was coined by Ferdinand T. Brooks around 1912. This term used by the followers of Helena Blavatsky to denominate the system of theosophical ideas expounded following the death of Blavatsky in 1891. This material differed in major respects from Blavatsky's original presentation, but it is accepted as genuinely theosophical by many theosophists around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/thomas/ |title=Theosophy Versus Neo-Theosophy: Margaret Thomas' Study of C.

Other neo-theosophists include [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s contemporary [[Peter Deunov]] and [[Samael Aun Weor]]. [[Dion Fortune]] and [[Aleister Crowley]] were also influencers of the leading edge of the theosophical movement. Some examples of neo-theosophists today include [[Benjamin Creme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://share-international.org/books/PDFs/BCreme_TransmissionAMeditationForTheNewAge_Jun06.pdf |author=[[Benjamin Creme]] |title=Transmission A meditation for the New Age |publisher=share-international.org |accessdate=5 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73hqv2NN3?url=http://share-international.org/books/PDFs/BCreme_TransmissionAMeditationForTheNewAge_Jun06.pdf |archivedate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Skumin]]. So, in 1990, Skumin, based on the theosophical concept of [[spiritual evolution]], proposed a classification of '''Homo spiritalis''' ([[Latin]]: ''Spiritual man''), the sixth root race, consisting of eight sub-races (subspecies): ''HS-0'' Anabiosis spiritalis, ''HS-1'' Scientella spiritalis, ''HS-2'' Aurora spiritalis, ''HS-3'' Ascensus spiritalis, ''HS-4'' Vocatus spiritalis, ''HS-5'' Illuminatio spiritalis, ''НS-6'' Creatio spiritalis, and ''HS-7'' Servitus spiritalis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skumin |first=V.

====Russian philosophy and Russian Cosmism ====

Russian [[philosophy]] as a separate entity started its development in the [[History of Russia (1892–1917)|19th century]], defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], insisting on developing [[Russia]] as a unique civilization. The latter group included [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the early founders of [[eurasianism]]. ''Slavophilia'' was an intellectual movement originating from 19th century that wanted the [[Russian Empire]] to be developed upon values and institutions derived from its early history. There were also similar movements in [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]], and [[Serbia]]. Depending on the historical context, its opposite could be termed [[Slavophobia]], a fear of [[Slavic culture]].&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068172/Slavophile |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Slavophile  Russian history |accessdate=6 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73jPhqyh2?url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Slavophile |archivedate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion of Russia's place in the world has since become the most characteristic feature of Russian philosophy. Notable  philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyev]], [[Vasily Rozanov]], [[Lev Shestov]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Pitirim Sorokin]].In its further development, Russian philosophy was also marked by deep connection to [[literature]] and interest in [[creativity]], [[society]], [[religion]], and [[Russian cosmism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-book |url=https://www.amazon.com/Red-Cosmos-Tsiolkovskii-Grandfather-Centennial/dp/1603441174 |author=James T.

Vladimir Solovyov described his encounters with the entity ''Sophia'' in his works, such as ''Three Encounters'' and ''Lectures on Godmanhood''. His fusion was driven by the desire to reconcile or unite with Orthodox Christianity the various traditions by the Russian [[Slavophiles]]' concept of [[sobornost]]. His Russian religious philosophy had a very strong impact on the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolist]] art movements of his time. His teachings on ''Sophia'', conceived as the merciful unifying feminine wisdom of God comparable to the Hebrew [[Shekinah]] or various goddess traditions, have been deemed a [[heresy]] by [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] and as unsound and unorthodox by the [[Patriarchate of Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecumenizm.tripod.com/ECUMENIZM/id17.html |title=The Sophian heresy and attempts to feminize God |publisher=ecumenizm.tripod.com |accessdate=6 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73jQWHmoo?url=http://ecumenizm.tripod.com/ECUMENIZM/id17.html |archivedate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov|Nikolai Fyodorov]] was a [[Russian Orthodox Christian]] philosopher, who was part of the Russian cosmism movement and a precursor of [[transhumanism]]. Fedorov argued that humanity is the culmination of [[evolution]], as well as its creator and director. Humans must therefore direct evolution where their reason and morality dictate. Fedorov stated that the struggle against death can become the most natural cause uniting all people, regardless of their nationality, race, citizenship or wealth. He called this the ''Common Cause''. Fedorov thought that death and afterdeath existence should become the subject of comprehensive scientific inquiry, that achieving [[immortality]] and revival is the greatest goal of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berdyaev.com/berdiaev/berd_lib/1915_186.html |author=[[Nikolai Berdyaev]] |title=The religion of resuscitative resurrection The "Philosophy of the Common Task" of N.

At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a burst of scientific investigation into interplanetary travel, largely driven by the fiction writers such as [[Jules Verne]] and [[Herbert Wells]] as well as philosophical movements like [[Russian cosmism]]. In 1903, [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] published the first serious scientific work on space travel. His work was essentially unknown outside the [[Russian Empire]], but inside the country it inspired further research, experimentation and the formation of the Society for Studies of [[Interplanetary spaceflight]].&lt;ref name="Riper2007"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k8CxJeFzCdQC&amp;pg=PA26 |author=A.

He believed humans would eventually colonize the [[Milky Way]]. His thought preceded the Space Age by several decades, and some of what he foresaw in his imagination has come into being since his death. Tsiolkovsky did not believe in traditional religious cosmology, but instead he believed in a cosmic being that governed humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.prlib.ru/en/node/404538 |last=[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky|Tsiolkovsky]] |first=Konstantin Eduardovich |title=The Will of the Universe; Unknown Intelligent Forces |place=[[Kaluga]] |publisher=The author's edition |year=1928 |pages=23 |language=Russian |accessdate=6 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73jR4GDrr?url=https://www.prlib.ru/en/node/404538 |archivedate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of the Russian philosophers and cossmists later were developed by those in the transhumanist movement and [[Rerikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2013 |url=http://sovieteramuseum.com/?product=art-works-by-russian-cosmism-painter-xx-xxi-ct-catalogue-of-exhibition-2013 |title=Art works by Russian cosmism painter XX – XXI ct.

Information about [[Vedanta]] and [[Buddhism]] spread in [[Western countries]] in the first decade of the 20th century. In the United States of the 1920s, when the voises in religion were arguing over [[fundamentalism]] and [[modernism]] as the only available choice, and long before [[Shangri-La]] had become a popularly accepted myth, a vanguard movement was promoting the alternative of the wisdom of the [[Eastern world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brian Taves |year=1985 |title=Philosophy Into Popular Fiction: Talbot Mundy and The Theosophical Society |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41171147?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |journal=Southern California QuarterlyTo |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=153-186 |doi=10.2307/41171147 |issn= |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qsRpCDp?url=http://scq.ucpress.edu/content/67/2/153 |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] proposed the existence of a society of Secret Chiefs called the [[Great White Brotherhood]]. The members of this Brotherhood, in belief systems akin to Theosophy and [[New Age]], are said to be perfected beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans. The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] or the [[Ascended Masters]]. They are referred to by [[theosophist]]s as Elder Brothers of the human race, [[Adept]]s, [[Mahātmā]]s, or simply as the Masters. The first person to talk about them in the West was [[Helena Blavatsky]], after she and other people claimed to have received messages from them. These included [[Nicholas Roerich]] and [[Helena Roerich]], too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=TI6fAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+myth+of+the+Masters+revived&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY0bbboKTeAhWOhqYKHY0ABHMQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20myth%20of%20the%20Masters%20revived&amp;f=false |title=The myth of the Masters revived: The Occult Lives of Nikolai and Elena Roerich |publisher=books.google.ru |isbn=978-90-04-27043-5 |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She emphasized that knowledge was the leading path of all great Teachers.

When Nicholas Roerich passed away, his wife is believed to have carried on the work prescribed by Master Morya, “I exist only due to the ray of the Great Master, who said it was necessary for me to remain because no one could replace me as I worked under the highest Cosmic Sign, and this century was in need of my attainment”. The main aim of Helena Roerich was to spread the message of Agni Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rbth.com/blogs/tatar_straits/2017/03/18/when-helena-roerich-called-kalimpong-home_721753 |title=When Helena Roerich called Kalimpong home |author=Ajay Kamalakaran |publisher=Russia beyond |date=18 March 2017 |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qtOgEyJ?url=https://www.rbth.com/blogs/tatar_straits/2017/03/18/when-helena-roerich-called-kalimpong-home_721753 |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Agni Yoga Society in the State of New York===
The Agni Yoga Society was founded in 1920 by Helena and Nicholas Roerich. It is a non-profit educational institution incor|porated in 1946 under the laws of the [[State of New York]], and is supported entirely by voluntary contributions and membership dues. The organization was located in the building ''[[Master Apartments]]''. The aims of the Society are embodied in the philosophy that gives it its name—Agni Yoga—as contained in the books of the Agni Yoga Series published by the Society. In them is found a synthesis of ancient Eastern beliefs and modern Western thought and a bridge between the spiritual and the scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.agniyoga.us/ |title=AGNI YOGA (Sacred Heart Fire) AGNI YOGA The Great Synthesis |publisher=agniyoga.us |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qtsQePo?url=http://www.agniyoga.us/ |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike previous [[yoga]]s, Agni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. Though not systematized in an ordinary sense, it is a teaching that helps the student to discover moral and spiritual guide-posts by which to learn to govern his or her life and thus contribute to the [[common good]]. For this reason Agni Yoga has been called a ''Living ethic''. 
Speaking about the role of [[personality]] in the [[spiritual evolution]] of mankind, [[Helena Roerich]] wrote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aquaac.org/un/elttrs/201003.html |title=The Spiritual Work of the United Nations and the Liberation of Humanity Creating Fundamental Global Transformations through the Power of Thought |publisher=aquaac.org |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qu54znq?url=http://www.aquaac.org/un/elttrs/201003.html  |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.agniyoga.org/ay_en/Letters-of-Helena-Roerich-II.php |title=Letters of Helena Roerich II, 25 October 1936 |publisher=agniyoga.org |accessdate=25 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6p2OJSzbs?url=http://www.agniyoga.org/ay_en/Letters-of-Helena-Roerich-II.php |archivedate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest benefit that we can contribute consists in the broadening of consciousness, and the improvement and enrichment of our thinking, together with the purification of the heart, in order to strengthen our emanations; and by thus raising our vibrations, we restore the health of all that surrounds us.
True, it is impossible to increase our store of psychic energy without the help of the Teacher; however if our hearts are open and purified, and if our organism permits it, the Teacher will not tarry in manifesting himself''.}}

===Latvian Roerich Society in Riga===
The [[Latvia]]n Roerich Society is one of the oldest society established by the Roerichs family. In 1920 Vladimir Schibayev, while being in [[London]], met  Nicholas and Helena Roerichs. In [[Riga]] they created a group of people to study Agni Yoga and another theosophical literature. In 1928, Schibayev went to [[India]], to become the secretary of Roerich.&lt;ref name="la"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latvijasrerihabiedriba.lv/images/RXLVang.htm |title=In short about Latvian Roerich Society |publisher=latvijasrerihabiedriba |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73quP4eRE?url=http://www.latvijasrerihabiedriba.lv/images/RXLVang.htm |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Riga the place of the leader of Latvian Roerich Society was taken by [[Doctor (title)|doctor]]-[[Homeopathy|homeopath]] [[:lv:Fēlikss Lūkins|Felix Lukin.]] [[Dr.]] Felix Lukin and his son Dr. [[:lv:Haralds Lūkins|Harald Lukin]] conducted [[clinical trials]] are many natural [[medication]]s that they received from [[Svetoslav Roerich]] of the Himalayan Research Institute named ''Urusvati''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB-0B1OWsbIC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=Feliks+Lukin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9sr1G3-LjI&amp;sig=BOFxH1ypWEF0Mff4E_p4yCgnFWc&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwikrLTm8JbeAhUFposKHVn1DlA4ChDoATAFegQIBBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Feliks%20Lukin&amp;f=false |title=History and status of homoeopathy around the world |author=Aswarda Das |publisher=books.google.com |isbn=81-8056-573-4 |year=2005 |pages=144-147 |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 [[:lv:Rihards Rudzītis|Rihard Rudzitis]] officially became the president of the Latvian Society. During his lead, the books of Living Ethics, the works by the Roerichs, [[Helena Blavatsky]]’s and works by Rudzitis himself were published. In 1937 the first conference of [[Baltic states|Baltic]] Roerich Societies took place. The Latvian Society was renewed at the [[Soviet Union]] in 1988. Dr. Harald Lukin carried the Roerichs [[Banner of Peace]]. The new president Gunta Rudzite, the daughter of Rihard Rudzitis, held contacts with many people of the republics in the [[USSR]] who were interested in the ideas of Agni Yoga. On 2005 the Roerich Society received a social beneficial status in the [[Republic of Latvia]].&lt;ref name="la"/&gt;

===Master Institute of United Arts in New York City===
Nicolas Roerich is known as a thinker and a builder of life. His art and writings are an evocation to Beauty, to Knowledge, and to Culture. His vision is nicely captured in his philosophical statement of the Master Institute of United Arts which he formed in [[New York City]] in 1921:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2017/07/12/nicholas-roerichs-symbolic-journey/ |title=Inspired By Art: Nicholas Roerich’s Symbolic Journey |publisher=philosophicalsociety.org |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qumopSR?url=https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2017/07/12/nicholas-roerichs-symbolic-journey/ |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|''Art will unify all humanity. Art is one – indivisible. Art has its many branches, yet all are one.  Art is the manifestation of the coming synthesis. Art is for all''.}}

Mr. and Mrs. Horch financed and directed the Master Institute that taught the fine and dramatic arts. For much of its existence, the Master Institute was housed in the [[Master Apartments]], designed by Harvery Wiley Corbett in 1929 for Roerich and built on the site of the former Horch mansion at 310 Riverside Dr. in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_6636038/ |title=Louis L. and Nettie S.

Roerich planned to realize the educational concepts at the Institute. He invited as teachers such famous people as [[George Bellows]], [[Claude Fayette Bragdon]], [[Norman Bel Geddes]], [[Stark Young]], [[Deems Taylor]], [[Robert Edmond Jones]], and [[Lee Simonson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich.org/roerich-biography.php |title=Nicholas Roerich Biography America |publisher=Nicholas Roerich Museum New York |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qvhsopy?url=http://www.roerich.org/roerich-biography.php |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intensive work was in process under direct supervision of Roerich. Nicholas gave lectures, organized new classes, for example classes of music and sculpture for the blind. Many representatives of American science and culture expressed their willingness to educate students according with the proposed curriculum. There were [[Felix Salmond]], [[Ernest Bloch]], and [[Michael Fokin]]. In the ''Institute of United Arts in New York City'' also taught [[Rockwell Kent]], [[Claude Bragdon]], [[George Bellows]], and [[Norman Bel Geddes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich-izvara.ru/eng/museum/roerich-and-america-13.htm

Some contemporaries were skeptical spiritual mission of Nicholas Roerich. But those who embraced his philosophy experienced something transformative in his canvases.

Roerich's family moved to [[India]] in December 1923. They settled in [[Darjeeling]], a town in the [[India]]n [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]]. It is located in the [[Lower Himalayan Range]]s at an elevation of {{convert|6700|ft|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ignca.gov.in/roerich-himalayan-museum-of-folk-and-tribal-art/ |title=Roerich Himalayan Museum Of Folk And Tribal Art |publisher=ignca.gov.in |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qx6ANWT?url=http://ignca.gov.in/roerich-himalayan-museum-of-folk-and-tribal-art/ |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1925 to 1928, Roerichs took part in a [[Central Asia]] expedition, that traveled through hard-to-reach and little-investigated regions of [[India]], [[China]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Tibet]]. [[Sikkim]] was the starting point of the expedition. During the expedition, research in topics such as [[history]], [[archeology]], [[ethnography]], [[history of philosophy]], [[arts]] and [[religions]], and [[geography]] was conducted. Rare manuscripts were found, and rich linguistic materials were collected. Special attention was paid to the problem of historical unity of cultures of various peoples. In 1925, Helena Roerich began to translate an extensive selection from ''[[The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett]]''. She also wrote a book named "Chalice of the East", which was published under the pen name "Iskander Khanum". Helena Roerich's manuscript "Foundations of Buddhism" was published in 1926, at [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga]], where her expedition was staying at the time. In this book, the fundamental philosophical notions of Buddha's Teaching were interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.found-helenaroerich.ru/eng/biography/ |title=Helena I.

{{Main|Nicholas Roerich Museum, New York City}}

The Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York City was originally located in the Master Apartments at 103rd Street and [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)]], which were built especially for Roerich in 1929. Now the museum is located in a brownstone at 319 West 107th Street on Manhattan's Upper West Side. This Museum is one of the most off-the-beaten-path of Manhattan's museums, a collection of works by Nicolas Roerich, who lived on the Upper West Side for a time in the 1920's. The brownstone is chock-full of amazing natural scenes from the Himalayas, where this artist spent  two decades of his life. Roerich usually painted in stark tempera, with blazing orange skies or impossibly deep blue mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/travel/journeys-specialty-museums-finding-art-not-crowds-in-new-york.html |date=16 April 2006 |author=Seth Kugel |title=JOURNEYS: SPECIALTY MUSEUMS; Finding Art, Not Crowds, in New York.

Currently, the museum includes between 100 and 200 of Roerich's works as well as a collection of archival materials and still attracts pilgrims from throughout the world. The mission of the Nicholas Roerich Museum is one: to make available to the public the full range of Roerich’s accomplishments. They cover the realms of art, science, spirituality, peacemaking, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5Kyo03NxncC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=%22Nicholas+Roerich+Museum%22&amp;ei=CfWySJWGBIyuyAT-uKz-Bg&amp;sig=ACfU3U1VaGGP0xsNuixcSHcUcdMEJCcA3g |title=Spiritual Places| last=Squires| first=Emily| authorlink=Emily Squires |author2=Len Belzer |year=2000| pages=86 |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |isbn=1931044031 |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum seeks to realize the ideas of Agni Yoga on the role of culture in the evolution of the world and evolution of the human consciousness.

It carries in itself a new cosmic world view for which new interest grows more each year. The core of the Rerikhism is the philosophy of cosmic reality – the Agni Yoga, which develops the idea of a close relationship between man and [[Cosmos]], contains knowledge which assists in understanding the specific features peculiar to the new evolutionary stage of mankind's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.icr.su/museum/ |title=The Nicholas Roerich Museum |accessdate=17 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6pms1o0eG?url=http://en.icr.su/museum/ |publisher=en.icr.su |archivedate=17 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The World Organisation of Culture of Health ('''WOCH''')'' — International [[Social movement organization|social movement]] ''To Health via Culture'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Междунаро́дное обще́ственное Движе́ние «К Здоро́вью че́рез Культу́ру») was founded in the year 1994. [[Victor Skumin]] was elected to the post of the President-founder of this organisation. The WOCH operates in accordance with the registered in [[Ministry of Justice (Russia)|Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation]] Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kult-zdor.ru/?page_id=824 |title=Charter of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (Russian: Устав) |publisher=Kult-zdor.ru |accessdate=18 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6poMifaLN?url=http://kult-zdor.ru/?page_id=824 |archivedate=18 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Agni Yoga much attention is paid to health. So in the book ''Supermundane'' (paragraph 525) recorded the words of [[Morya (Theosophy)|Master Morya]], addressed to Urusvati,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Supermundane.php |title=Supermundane, 525 |publisher=agniyoga.org |accessdate=14 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73ATQDcyS?url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Supermundane.php |archivedate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''Urusvati knows that people are responsible for three aspects of health. First, their own health; second, the health of the planet; and finally, the health of the Supermundane World... People must safeguard their own health, not only for themselves but also for those around them.

Prof. Verhorubova and Prof. Lobanova from [[Tomsk State Pedagogical University]] argued (2012) that in accordance with the concept of a culture of health, proposed by [[Victor Skumin|Skumin]], the culture  – spiritual, mental, and physical – determines the status of human health. And health – spiritual, mental, physical – is a prerequisite for achieving a higher level of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/mnogoobrazie-opredeleniy-fenomena-kultura-zdorovya-kak-pokazatel-ego-mnogogrannosti-v-pedagogicheskom-obrazovanii |last2=Lobanova |first2=N.A. |last1= Verhorubova |first1=O.V. |title= Многообразие определений феномена "культура здоровья" как показатель его многогранности в педагогическом образовании |trans-title=The diversity of definitions the phenomenon of "culture of health" as an indicator of its versatility in education |journal=Вестник Томского государственного педагогического университета |year=2012 |issue=5 |pages=161–5 |accessdate=10 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cKKxNxWb |archivedate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[anthem]] of WOCH (''To Health via Culture'') consists of four [[stanzas]].

Another anthem by [[Victor Skumin#Literary and publishing activities|Skumin]] is termed "Urusvati". [[Helena Roerich]], known as the ''[[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] Urusvati'' in Agni Yoga and [[Rerikhism]]. This anthem begins with the phrase, "The fire of the heart ignites Urusvati, she teaches the spirit take-off on the wings of the grace".

'''William Heaphy''' (18 December 1888 – 21 May 1914) was an [[Australian rules football]]er who played with [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmesby|first=Russell|last2=Main|first2=Jim|title=The Encyclopedia Of AFL Footballers| publisher=BAS Publishing|year=2007|isbn=9781920910785}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was from [[Tatura Football Club|Tatura]] originally and went to [[The Geelong College|Geelong College]], but came to Essendon via [[West Melbourne Football Club|West Melbourne]], during the [[1908 VFL season]].&lt;ref name=Essendon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essendonfc.com.au/team/player-past.asp?id=432 |title=Heaphy, Bill |publisher=Essendon Football Club official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424070458/http://www.essendonfc.com.au/team/player-past.asp?id=432 |archivedate=24 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essendon==
Heaphy made his league debut in Essendon's round 18 win over [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] at [[East Melbourne Cricket Ground|East Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1908/050919080905.html| title=Essendon v Geelong| publisher=AFL Tables}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second appearance for Essendon was in the [[1908 VFL Grand Final]].&lt;ref name=AFLTables&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1908/030519080926.html| title=1908 Grand Final| publisher=AFL Tables}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest player on the field, at 19 years of age, but not the least experienced, as teammate Harry Prout was making his debut.&lt;ref name=AFLTables/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lovett, Michael|title=AFL 2004 - The Official Statistical History Of The AFL| publisher=AFL Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-9580300-5-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essendon lost by nine points, with Heaphy playing in a [[forward pocket]].&lt;ref name=Essendon/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFLTables/&gt;

He played three games with Essendon in the [[1909 VFL season|1909 season]], then transferred to [[Brunswick Football Club|Brunswick]] mid season and finished the year with another grand final appearance, this time finishing on the winning side.&lt;ref name=Essendon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/1909.html#5| title=1909 Stats| publisher=AFL Tables}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Coburg Leader'', [http://www.trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/66825235 "Football: Brunswick v Prahran"], 1 October 1909, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poor health and death==
Heaphy had serious issues with his heart and in 1914 spent some time in a Melbourne private hospital.&lt;ref&gt;''Shepparton Advertiser'', [http://www.trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/91359589 "Personal"], 25 May 1914, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Back at [[Kyabram]] on 21 May 1914, Heaphy suffered a fatal seizure, having earlier taken what he thought was his heart medication.&lt;ref&gt;''Weekly Times (Victoria)'', [http://www.trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/121130575 "Country"], 30 May 1914, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; It was ruled by a coroner that he had been poisoned and gave a verdict of accidental death&lt;ref&gt;''[[Albury Banner and Wodonga Express]]'', [http://www.trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/101420899/10900282 "Victoria"], 29 May 1914, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lewis Brian Hopkin Jones'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstones.com/artist/brian-jones/ |title=Brian Jones |date= |website=The Rolling Stones.com |publisher=The Rolling Stones |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnard |first=Stephen |date=1993 |title=The Rolling Stones: Street Fighting Years |publisher=BDD Illustrated Books |page=22 |isbn=079245801X }}&lt;/ref&gt; (28 February 1942 – 3 July 1969) was an English musician, best known as the founder and the original leader of [[the Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref name="Wyman &amp; Coleman"&gt;Wyman, Bill, with Ray Coleman (1997). ''Stone Alone: The Story of a Rock 'n' Roll Band.'' New York: DaCapo Press. {{ISBN|0-306-80783-1}}, pp. 24, 76, 93, 101–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially a [[slide guitar]]ist, Jones would go on to play a wide variety of instruments on Rolling Stones recordings and in concerts, such as  [[rhythm guitar|rhythm]] and [[lead guitar]], various [[keyboard instrument]]s such as [[piano]] and [[organ (music)|organ]], [[marimba]], [[harmonica]], [[sitar]], wind instruments such as [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[saxophone]] and numerous others.

Jones and fellow guitarist [[Keith Richards]] developed a unique style of guitar play that Richards refers to as the "ancient art of weaving" where both players would play rhythm and lead parts together; Richards would carry the style on with later Stones guitarists and the sound would become a Rolling Stones trademark.

After he founded the Rolling Stones as a [[British blues]] outfit in 1962, and gave the band its name, Jones' fellow band members [[Mick Jagger]] and Keith Richards began to take over the band's musical direction, especially after they became a successful [[Jagger/Richards|songwriting team]]. Jones also did not get along with the band's manager, [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], who pushed the band into a musical direction at odds with Jones' blues background. At the same time, Jones developed alcohol and drugs problems, and his performance in the studio became increasingly unreliable, leading to a diminished role within the band he had founded. The Rolling Stones asked Jones to leave in June 1969 and guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] took his place in the group. Jones died less than a month later by drowning in the swimming pool at his home while under the influence of alcohol and drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/obituary-brian-jones-19690809|title=Obituary: Brian Jones|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-time Rolling Stones bass guitarist [[Bill Wyman]] said of Jones, "He formed the band. He chose the members. He named the band. He chose the music we played. He got us gigs. ... he was very influential, very important, and then slowly lost it – highly intelligent – and just kind of wasted it and blew it all away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=93511441 | first= Rob |last=Lowman | title= Roll of a lifetime founding bassist bill wyman looks back at the stones.| date= 27 October 2002| work= Daily News |location= Los Angeles| publisher= thefreelibrary.com| accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and paternity===
Lewis Brian Hopkin Jones was born in the Park Nursing Home in [[Cheltenham]], Gloucestershire, on 28 February 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Brian had two sisters: Pamela, who was born on 3 October 1943 and died on 14 October 1945 of [[leukemia]]; and Barbara, born on 22 August 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Wyman 2002, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Jones' parents were interested in music: his father, Lewis, was a [[piano]] teacher in addition to his job as an [[aeronautical engineer]], and his mother, Louisa, played piano and [[organ (music)|organ]] and led the [[choir]] at the local [[Church (building)|church]].&lt;ref name="wymanp10p16"/&gt;

In 1957 Jones first heard [[Cannonball Adderley]]'s music, which inspired his interest in jazz. Jones persuaded his parents to buy him a [[saxophone]] and two years later his parents gave him his first [[acoustic guitar]] as a 17th birthday present.&lt;ref name="wymanp23"&gt;Wyman 2002. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones attended local schools, including [[Dean Close School]], from September 1949 to July 1953 and [[Pate's Grammar School|Cheltenham Grammar School for Boys]], which he entered in September 1953 after passing the [[Eleven-plus]] exam. He enjoyed badminton and diving at school and attained first [[clarinet]] in the school orchestra. In 1957 he reportedly obtained seven [[O-levels|O-level]] passes, then he continued into the [[sixth form]] and obtained a further two O-levels. He also took three [[A-levels]] in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and passed in Physics and Chemistry, but failed in Biology.&lt;ref name="wymanp19"&gt;Wyman 2002. p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was able to perform well in exams despite a lack of academic effort.&lt;ref name="wymanp19" /&gt; However, he found school regimented and disliked conforming. He disliked the school uniforms and angered teachers with his behaviour, though he was popular with classmates.&lt;ref name="wymanp19"/&gt; Jones himself said: "When I made the sixth form I found myself accepted by the older boys; suddenly I was in."&lt;ref name="wymanp19" /&gt;

His hostility to authority figures resulted in his suspension from school on two occasions.&lt;ref name="wymanp19" /&gt; According to Dick Hattrell, a childhood friend: "He was a rebel without a cause, but when examinations came he was brilliant."&lt;ref name="wymanp19"/&gt;

In late summer 1959, Jones' 17-year-old girlfriend, a [[Cheltenham]] schoolgirl named Valerie Corbett, became pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ride|first=Graham|title=Foundation Stone|year=2001|isbn=1-904221-02-5|pages=103–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Jones is said to have encouraged her to have an [[abortion]], she carried the child to term and placed baby Barry David (later Simon) for [[adoption]].&lt;ref name="wymanp19"/&gt;

Jones quit school in disgrace and left home, travelling for a summer through Northern Europe and Scandinavia. During this period, he lived a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle, [[busking]] with his guitar on the streets for money, and living off the charity of others. Eventually, he ran short of money and returned to England.&lt;ref name="wymanp28"&gt;Wyman 2002. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones listened to [[classical music]] as a child, but preferred [[blues]], particularly [[Elmore James]] and [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]. He began performing at local blues and jazz clubs, while busking and working odd jobs. He reportedly stole small amounts of money from work to pay for cigarettes, for which he was fired.&lt;ref name="wymanp35-36"&gt;Wyman 2002. p. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1959, Jones went to the Wooden Bridge Hotel in [[Guildford]] to see a band perform. He met a young married woman named Angeline, and the two had a one-night stand that resulted in her pregnancy. Angeline and her husband decided to raise the baby, Carolyn, born on 4 August 1960. Jones never knew about her birth.&lt;ref name="wymanp28" /&gt;

In 1961, Jones applied for a scholarship to [[Cheltenham Art College]]. He was initially accepted into the programme, but two days later the offer was withdrawn after an unidentified acquaintance wrote to the college, calling Jones an irresponsible drifter.&lt;ref name="wymanp29"&gt;Wyman 2002. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 October 1961, Jones' girlfriend Pat Andrews gave birth to his third child, Julian Mark Andrews.&lt;ref name="wymanp30-31"&gt;Wyman 2002. p. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones sold his record collection to buy flowers for Pat and clothes for the newborn. He lived with them for a while. On 23 July 1964 another woman, Linda Lawrence (later married to [[Donovan]]), gave birth to Jones' fourth child, Julian Brian.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1992. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; In early October 1964, an occasional girlfriend of Brian's, Dawn Molloy, announced to Brian and the band's management that she was pregnant by Brian. She received a cheque for £700 ({{Inflation|UK|700|1964|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) from Oldham. In return, she signed an agreement that the matter was now closed and she would make no statement about Brian Jones or the child to the public or the press. The undated statement was signed by Molloy and witnessed by Mick Jagger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forming the Rolling Stones===
Jones left Cheltenham and moved to London where he became friends with fellow musicians [[Alexis Korner]], future [[Manfred Mann]] singer [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]], then named Paul Pond,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv|last=Rej |first=Bent |date=2006 |title=The Rolling Stones: in the beginning |location=Great Britain |publisher=Firefly Books Ltd |page=66 |isbn=978-1-55407-230-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; future [[Cream (band)|Cream]] bassist [[Jack Bruce]], and others who made up the small London [[rhythm and blues]] and jazz scene there. He became a blues musician, for a brief time calling himself "Elmo Lewis", and playing [[slide guitar]]. Jones also started a group with Paul Jones called the ''Roosters'' and in January 1963, after both Brian and Paul left the group, [[Eric Clapton]] took over Brian's position as guitarist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
|last=Clapton |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Clapton

|edition=First |year=2007
|publisher=[[Broadway Books]]
|isbn=978-0-385-51851-2
|page=40
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones placed an advertisement in ''Jazz News'' (a Soho club information sheet) on 2 May 1962, inviting musicians to audition for a new R&amp;B group at the Bricklayer's Arms pub; pianist [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian "Stu" Stewart]] was the first to respond. Later singer [[Mick Jagger]] also joined this band; Jagger and his childhood friend [[Keith Richards]] had met Jones when he and [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]] were playing [[Elmore James]]' "[[Dust My Broom]]" with Korner's band at the [[Ealing Jazz Club]].&lt;ref name="wymanp32"&gt;Wyman 2002. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Jagger brought guitarist Richards to rehearsals; Richards then joined the band. Jones' and Stewart's acceptance of Richards and the [[Chuck Berry]] songs he wanted to play coincided with the departure of blues purists [[Geoff Bradford (musician)|Geoff Bradford]] and Brian Knight, who had no tolerance for Chuck Berry.&lt;ref name="wymanp35-36"/&gt;

As Keith Richards tells it, Jones came up with the name the "Rollin' Stones" (later with the 'g') while on the phone with a venue owner. "The voice on the other end of the line obviously said, 'What are you called?' Panic! ''The Best of Muddy Waters'' album was lying on the floor—and track five, side one was 'Rollin' Stone Blues'".&lt;ref&gt;Jagger, Richards, Watts, Wood 2003. p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rollin' Stones played their first gig on 12 July 1962 in the [[Marquee Club]] in London with Jagger, Richards, Jones, Stewart, bass player [[Dick Taylor]] (later of [[the Pretty Things]]) and drummer [[Tony Chapman]].&lt;ref name="karnbach-p57-58"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Karnbach |first=James |author2=Benson, Carol |title=It's Only Rock 'n' Roll: The Ultimate Guide to the Rolling Stones |publisher=Facts on File, Inc. |year=1997 |isbn=0-8160-3035-9 |pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some sources erroneously list [[Mick Avory]] as the drummer at that gig, but Avory himself denies it.&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 1962 to September 1963 Jones, Jagger and Richards shared a flat (referred to by Richards as "a beautiful dump")&lt;ref name="jaggerp37"&gt;Jagger, Richards, Watts, Wood 2003. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; at 102 Edith Grove, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], with James Phelge, a future photographer whose name was used in some of the group's early "Nanker/Phelge" writing credits. Jones and Richards spent day after day playing guitar while listening to blues records (notably [[Jimmy Reed]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Willie Dixon]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]]). During this time, Jones also taught Jagger how to play harmonica.

The four Rollin' Stones went searching for a bassist and drummer, finally settling on [[Bill Wyman]] on bass because he had a spare [[VOX AC30]] [[guitar amplifier]]&lt;ref name="Keith Richards 'Life"&gt;Richards p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; and always had cigarettes, as well as a bass guitar that he had built himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billwyman.com/site/news/678/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913114755/http://www.billwyman.com/site/news/678/ |archivedate=13 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After playing with [[Mick Avory]], [[Tony Chapman]] and [[Carlo Little]], in January 1963 they finally persuaded jazz-influenced [[Charlie Watts]] to join them. At the time, Watts was considered by fellow musicians to be one of the better drummers in London; he had played with (among others) Alexis Korner's group [[Blues Incorporated]].

Watts described Jones' role in these early days: "Brian was very instrumental in pushing the band at the beginning. Keith and I would look at him and say he was barmy. It was a crusade to him to get us on the stage in a club and be paid [[Half crown (British coin)|half-a-crown]] and to be billed as an R&amp;B band".&lt;ref&gt;Jagger, Mick; Richards, Keith; Watts, Charlie; Wood, Ronnie. ''According to the Rolling Stones.'' Chronicle Books, 2003: p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

While acting as the band's business manager, Jones received £5 more than the other members ({{Inflation|UK|5|1963|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}), which did not sit well with the rest of the band and created resentment.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|pp=65, 114}} Keith Richards has said that both he and Jagger were surprised to learn that Jones considered himself the leader and was receiving the extra £5, especially as other people, like [[Giorgio Gomelsky]], appeared to be doing the booking.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Keith and James Fox. Life. 2010: Little, Brown &amp; Company, pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical contributions===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Kungliga Tennishallen Stones 1966a.jpg|thumb|Jones (left) with The Stones in Stockholm (1966)]]
Jones was a talented [[multi-instrumentalist]], seemingly at home on any musical instrument. For many Rolling Stones tracks prior to 1969, for any instrument except the standard rock instrumentation of drums, guitars, piano, or bass, Jones would be the one playing it. His aptitude for playing a wide variety of instruments is particularly evident on the albums ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966), ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' (1967) and ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'' (1967). As a guitarist, in the early days he favored a white teardrop-shaped electric guitar produced by the [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] company especially in live performances; he also played a wide variety of electric and acoustic guitars from companies such as Rickenbacker, Gibson, and Fender. 
As a slide guitarist, Jones favored the [[open E tuning]] and [[open G tuning]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Trynka interview with [[Dick Taylor]], early bass player for the Rolling Stones: {{cite web|last1=[[Paul Trynka|Trynka]]|first1=Paul|title=Open G tunings and open secrets|url=http://trynka.net/2014/08/open-g-tunings-and-open-secrets/|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of Jones' contributions are his slide guitar on "[[I Wanna Be Your Man]]" (1963), "[[I'm a King Bee]]", "[[Little Red Rooster]]" (1964), "[[I'm Movin' On (Hank Snow song)|I'm Movin' On]]" (1965), "Doncha Bother Me" and "[[No Expectations]]". Jones can also be heard playing Bo Diddley-style rhythm guitar on "[[Mona (I Need You Baby)|I Need You Baby]]" and on "[[Please Go Home]]", the guitar riff in "[[The Last Time (The Rolling Stones song)|The Last Time]]";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian |url=http://www.timeisonourside.com/SOLastTime.html |title=The Last Time |publisher=Timeisonourside.com |accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sitar]] on "[[Street Fighting Man]]" and "[[Paint It Black]]"; organ on "[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]"; [[marimba]] on "[[Under My Thumb]]", "[[Out of Time (The Rolling Stones song)|Out of Time]]" and "[[Yesterday's Papers]]"; [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] on "[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]" and "All Sold Out"; saxophone on "Child of the Moon" and "[[Citadel (song)|Citadel]]"; [[kazoo]] on "[[Cool, Calm And Collected]]"; [[Appalachian dulcimer]] on "I Am Waiting" and "[[Lady Jane (song)|Lady Jane]]", [[Mellotron]] on "[[She's a Rainbow]]", "[[We Love You]]", "[[Stray Cat Blues]]", "[[2000 Light Years from Home]]", and "Citadel"; and the [[autoharp]] on "[[Ride On, Baby]]" and (for his final recording as a Rolling Stone) on "[[You Got the Silver]]". He also played the oboe/soprano sax solo in "[[Dandelion]]".

Jones also played harmonica on many of the Rolling Stones' early songs. Examples of Jones' playing are on "[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]", "[[Stoned (The Rolling Stones song)|Stoned]]" (1963), "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]" (1964), "[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]", "Now I've Got A Witness" (1964), "Good Times, Bad Times" (1964), "[[2120 South Michigan Avenue]]" (1964) (from E.P. ''Five By Five''), "The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man", "One More Try" (1965), "High and Dry" and "[[Goin' Home (The Rolling Stones song)|Goin' Home]]" (1966), "Who's Driving Your Plane?" (1966), "Cool Calm and Collected", "Who's Been Sleeping Here" (1967), and "[[Dear Doctor (song)|Dear Doctor]]" and "Prodigal Son" (1968).

In the early years, Jones often served as a backing vocalist. Notable examples are "[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]", "I Wanna Be Your Man", "I Just Wanna Make Love to You", "[[Walking the Dog]]", "[[Money (That's What I Want)|Money]]", "I'm Alright", "[[You Better Move On (song)|You Better Move On]]" and "[[It's All Over Now]]". He contributed backing vocals as late as 1968 on "[[Sympathy for the Devil]]". He is also responsible for the whistling on "Walking the Dog".

Richards maintains that what he calls "guitar weaving"&lt;ref&gt;[http://odeo.com/audio/5490053/view Rolling Stones' Guitar Weaving (Podcast)-Q107 Toronto] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021141144/http://odeo.com/audio/5490053/view |date=21 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emerged from this period, from listening to [[Jimmy Reed]] albums: "We listened to the teamwork, trying to work out what was going on in those records; how you could play together with two guitars and make it sound like four or five".&lt;ref&gt;Jagger, Richards, Watts, Wood 2003. p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Jones' and Richards' guitars became a signature of the sound of the Rolling Stones, with both guitarists playing rhythm and lead without clear boundaries between the two roles.

===Estrangement from bandmates===
[[File:MichaelCooper1967BenMerk.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Michael Cooper (photographer)|Michael Cooper]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Al Vandenberg]], Jones and [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] (Amsterdam, 1967)]]
[[Andrew Loog Oldham]]'s arrival as manager marked the beginning of Jones' slow estrangement. Oldham recognised the financial advantages of bandmembers' writing their own songs, as exemplified by [[Lennon–McCartney]], and that playing covers would not sustain a band in the limelight for long. Further, Oldham wanted to make Jagger's charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances. Jones saw his influence over the Stones' direction slide as their repertoire comprised fewer of the blues covers than he preferred; more [[Jagger/Richards]] originals developed, and Oldham increased his own managerial control, displacing Jones from yet another role.&lt;ref name="wymanp76"&gt;Wyman 2002. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Oldham in his book ''Stoned'', Jones was an outsider from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Loog Oldham, ''Stoned'' (St. Martin's Press, 2005), p. 210 – 300.&lt;/ref&gt; When the first tours were arranged in 1963, he travelled separately from the band, stayed at different hotels, and demanded extra pay. According to Oldham, Jones was very emotional and felt alienated because he was not a prolific songwriter and his management role had been taken away. He "resisted the symbiosis demanded by the group lifestyle, and so life was becoming more desperate for him day by day. None of us were looking forward to Brian totally cracking up".&lt;ref&gt;Oldham 2005. p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The toll from days on the road, the money and fame, and the feeling of being alienated from the group resulted in Jones' overindulgence in alcohol and other drugs. These excesses had a debilitative effect on his physical and mental health and, according to Oldham, Jones became unfriendly and antisocial at times.

Jones was arrested for drug possession on 10 May 1967, shortly after the "Redlands" incident at Richards' Sussex home. Authorities found [[marijuana]], [[cocaine]], and [[methamphetamine]] in his flat. He confessed to marijuana use but claimed he did not use hard drugs.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=154}}

In June 1967, Jones attended the [[Monterey Pop Festival]]. There he met [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Dennis Hopper]], and went on stage to introduce the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]] who were not yet well known in the United States.

Hostility grew between Jones, Jagger, and Richards, alienating Jones further from the group.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Booth, ''The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones'' (Canongate Books, 2012), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many noted that Jones could be friendly and outgoing, Wyman, Richards, and Watts have commented that he could also be cruel and difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Richards and Fox, ''Life'', pp. 271–272&lt;/ref&gt; By most accounts, Jones' attitude changed frequently; he was one minute caring and generous, the next making an effort to anger everyone. As Wyman observed in ''Stone Alone'': "There were at least two sides to Brian's personality. One Brian was introverted, shy, sensitive, deep-thinking. The other was a preening peacock, gregarious, artistic, desperately needing assurance from his peers."&lt;ref&gt;Bill Wyman, ''Stone Alone'', p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; "He pushed every friendship to the limit and way beyond".&lt;ref&gt;Bill Wyman, ''Stone Alone'', p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1967, [[Anita Pallenberg]], Jones' girlfriend of two years, left him for Richards when Jones was hospitalised during a trip the three made to Morocco,&lt;ref&gt;''Life'', pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt; further damaging the already strained relations between Jones and Richards. As tensions and Jones' substance abuse increased, his musical contributions became sporadic. He became bored with the guitar and sought exotic instruments to play, and he was increasingly absent from recording sessions. In [[Peter Whitehead (filmmaker)|Peter Whitehead]]'s promotional film for ''[[We Love You#Promotional film|We Love You]]'', made in July 1967, he appears extremely groggy and disoriented.{{sfn|Jackson|1992|p=161}}

Jones' last substantial sessions with the Stones occurred in spring and summer of 1968 when the Stones produced "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]" and the ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' album. He can be seen in the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Sympathy for the Devil (film)|One Plus One]]'' playing acoustic guitar and chatting and sharing cigarettes with Richards, although Jones is neglected in the music-making. The film chronicles the making of "[[Sympathy for the Devil]]".

Where once Jones played multiple instruments on many tracks, he now played only minor roles on a few pieces. Jones' last formal appearance was in the December 1968 ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'', a part concert, part circus-act film organised by the band. It went unreleased for more than 25 years because Jagger was unhappy with the band's performance compared to others in the film such as [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[John Lennon]], [[The Who]], and [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]].&lt;ref name="rnrcircus"&gt;{{cite video |people=The Rolling Stones, Pete Townshend | title=Rock and Roll Circus |medium=commentary to the 2004 DVD release |publisher=ABKCO Films |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentary included as bonus material indicated that almost everyone at the concert sensed that the end of Jones' time with the Rolling Stones was near, and [[Roger Daltrey]] and [[Pete Townshend]] of [[The Who]] thought it would be Jones' last live musical performance.&lt;ref name="rnrcircus"/&gt;

===Departure from the Rolling Stones===
Jones was arrested a second time on 21 May 1968, for possession of cannabis, which Jones said had been left by previous tenants of the flat. Due to his being on probation, he was facing a long jail sentence if found guilty. The jury found him guilty but the judge had sympathy for Jones; instead of jailing him, he fined him £50 ({{Inflation|UK|50|1968|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) plus £105 in costs ({{Inflation|UK|105|1968|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn |UK |df=y}}) and told him: "For goodness sake, don't get into trouble again or it really ''will'' be serious".&lt;ref name="wymanp311"&gt;Wyman 2002. p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones' legal troubles, estrangement from his bandmates, substance abuse, and mood swings became too much of an obstacle to his active participation in the band. The Rolling Stones wanted to tour the United States in 1969 for the first time in three years but Jones was not in fit condition to tour and his second arrest exacerbated problems with acquiring a US work visa. In addition, Jones' attendance at rehearsals and recording sessions had become erratic; and when he did appear he either rarely contributed anything musically or, when he did, his bandmates would switch off his amplifier, leaving Richards to play nearly all the guitars. According to author Gary Herman, Jones was "literally incapable of making music; when he tried to play harmonica his mouth started bleeding".&lt;ref&gt;Gary Herman, ''Rock 'N' Roll Babylon'' (Norfolk: Fakenham Press, 1982), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

This behaviour was problematic during the ''Their Satanic Majesties Request'' and ''Beggar's Banquet'' sessions and had worsened by the time the band commenced recording ''Let It Bleed''. In March 1969, Jones borrowed the group's Jaguar and went shopping in Pimlico Road. After the parked car was towed away by police, Jones hired a chauffeur-driven car to get home.&lt;ref name="wymanp323"&gt;Wyman 2002. p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1969, Jones crashed his motorcycle into a shop window and was secretly taken to hospital under an assumed name.&lt;ref name="wymanp323" /&gt; From this point, Jones was still attending recording sessions but was no longer a major contributor to the band's music.&lt;ref name="wymanp323" /&gt; By May, he had made two contributions to the work in progress: autoharp on "[[You Got the Silver]]" and percussion on "[[Midnight Rambler]]". Jagger informed Jones that he would be fired from the band if he did not turn up to a photo session. Looking frail, he nonetheless showed up and his last photo session as a Rolling Stone took place on 21 May 1969, first at [[St. Katherine Docks]], Tower Bridge, London and then at [[Ethan Russell]]'s photographic studio in [[South Kensington]]. The photos would appear on the album ''[[Through The Past Darkly (Big Hits Vol.2)]]'' in September 1969.&lt;ref&gt;"Wyman"."Rolling with the Stones" p."344"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stones decided that following the release of the ''Let it Bleed'' album (scheduled for a July 1969 release in the US) they would start a North American tour in November 1969. However, the Stones management was informed that because of his drug convictions Jones would not receive a work permit. At the suggestion of pianist and road manager [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]], the Stones decided to add a new guitarist and, on 8 June 1969, Jones was visited by Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Charlie Watts and was told that the group he had formed would continue without him.&lt;ref name="wymanp324-326"&gt;Wyman 2002. p. 324-326&lt;/ref&gt;

To the public it appeared as if Jones had left voluntarily; the other band members told him that although he was being asked to leave, it was his choice how to break it to the public. Jones released a statement on 9 June 1969, announcing his departure. In this statement he said, among other things, that "I no longer see eye-to-eye with the others over the discs we are cutting".&lt;ref name="wymanp326"&gt;Wyman 2002. p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was replaced by the 20-year-old guitarist formerly of [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]], [[Mick Taylor]].

During the period of his decreasing involvement in the band Jones was living at [[Cotchford Farm]] in East Sussex, the residence formerly owned by ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' author [[A. A. Milne]]&lt;ref name="teleg2012"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/9258085/The-rock-n-roll-house-at-Pooh-corner.html| title= The rock 'n' roll house at Pooh corner| first= Christopher |last= Middleton| date=12 May 2012 | work= The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Jones had purchased in November 1968. [[Alexis Korner]], who visited in late June, noted that Jones seemed "happier than he had ever been".&lt;ref name="wymanp329"&gt;Wyman 2002, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Jones is known to have contacted Korner, [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]], [[John Lennon]], [[Mitch Mitchell]], and [[Jimmy Miller (producer)|Jimmy Miller]] about intentions to put together another band. Jones had apparently demoed a few of his own songs in the weeks before his death, including "Has Anybody Seen My Baby?" and "Chow Time".&lt;ref name="aeppli.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aeppli.ch/TUG08/CDJonesUp.pdf |title=The Pipes of Pan |publisher=Aeppli.ch |accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equipment===
Jones' main guitar in the early years was a [[Harmony Company|Harmony]] Stratotone, which he replaced with a [[Gretsch]] Double Anniversary in two-tone green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=babiuk|first1=andy|last2=prevost|first2=greg|title=Rolling Stones Gear|date=2013|publisher=backbeat books|isbn=978-1-61713-092-2 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 and 1965, he often used a teardrop-shaped prototype [[Vox Mark III]]. From late 1965 until his death, Jones used [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] models (various [[Gibson Firebird|Firebird]]s, [[Gibson ES-330|ES-330]], and a [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul model]]), as well as two [[Rickenbacker]] [[twelve string guitar|12-string]] models. He can also be seen playing a [[Fender Telecaster]] in the 1968 "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]" promo video.

===Death===
[[File:Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones - geograph.org.uk - 670236.jpg|thumb|right|Jones' grave in Cheltenham Cemetery.]]
At around midnight on the night of 2–3 July 1969, Jones was discovered motionless at the bottom of his swimming pool at Cotchford Farm. His Swedish girlfriend, Anna Wohlin, was convinced Jones was alive when he was taken out of the pool, insisting he still had a pulse. However, by the time the doctors arrived it was too late and he was pronounced dead. The coroner's report stated "[[death by misadventure]]" and noted his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by drug and alcohol abuse.&lt;ref name="wymanp329"/&gt;

Upon Jones' death, [[the Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] wrote a poem titled "A Normal Day for Brian, A Man Who Died Every Day" (printed in ''The Times''), [[Jimi Hendrix]] dedicated a song to him on US television, and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[The Doors]] published a poem titled "Ode to L.A. While Thinking of Brian Jones, Deceased".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Max A.K. |url=http://www.people.nnov.ru/thedoors/wilderness2.htm |title=Ode to L.A.

The Rolling Stones performed at a free concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] on 5 July 1969, two days after Jones' death. The concert had been scheduled weeks earlier as an opportunity to present the Stones' new guitarist, [[Mick Taylor]], and the band decided to dedicate the concert to Jones. Before the Rolling Stones' set Jagger read excerpts from "[[Adonais]]", a poem by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] about the death of his friend [[John Keats]], and stagehands released hundreds of white butterflies as part of the tribute. The band opened with a [[Johnny Winter]] song that was one of Jones' favourites, "I'm Yours and I'm Hers".

Jones was reportedly buried {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} deep in [[Cheltenham]] Cemetery (to prevent exhumation by trophy hunters). His body was embalmed, hair bleached white, and was placed in an air-tight metal casket.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hobley, Trevor [psychimedia]|date=14 April 2009|title=The Psychic Detective - Brian Jones Case (3/5) [Video File]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3GaobXyEQ|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watts and Wyman were the only Rolling Stones who attended the funeral. Mick Jagger and [[Marianne Faithfull]] were travelling to Australia to begin the filming of ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]''; they stated that their contracts did not allow them to delay the trip to attend the funeral.

When asked if he felt guilty about Jones' death, Mick Jagger told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 1995: "No, I don't really. I do feel that I behaved in a very childish way, but we were very young, and in some ways we picked on him. But, unfortunately, he made himself a target for it; he was very, very jealous, very difficult, very [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], and if you do that in this kind of a group of people you get back as good as you give, to be honest. I wasn't understanding enough about his drug addiction. No one seemed to know much about drug addiction. Things like LSD were all new. No one knew the harm. People thought cocaine was good for you."&lt;ref name="jaggerremembers"&gt;{{cite web|last= Wenner |first=Jann S. |title=Jagger Remembers |date=14 December 1995 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/mick_jagger_remembers
|accessdate=4 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Murder claims====
Theories surrounding Jones' death developed soon afterwards with associates of the Stones claiming to have information that he was murdered.&lt;ref name = "phil"&gt;Philip Norman, ''The Stones: The Definitive Biography'', Pan Macmillan, 2011, chapter 12, unpaginated.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Southwell, Sean Twist, ''Conspiracy files: paranoia, secrecy, intrigue'', Random House Value Publishing, 2004, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; According to rock biographer [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], "the murder theory would bubble back to the surface every five years or so".&lt;ref name = "phil"/&gt; In 1993 it was reported that Jones was murdered by Frank Thorogood, who was doing some construction work on the property. He was the last person to see Jones alive. Thorogood allegedly confessed the murder to the Rolling Stones' driver, Tom Keylock, who later denied this.&lt;ref name="wymanp328"&gt;Wyman 2002. p. 328-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Thorogood theory was dramatised in the 2005 movie ''[[Stoned (film)|Stoned]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Segalstad, Josh Hunter, ''The 27s: The Greatest Myth of Rock &amp; Roll'', Samadhi Creations, LLC, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Sussex Police decided to review Jones' death for the first time since 1969, after new evidence was handed to them by Scott Jones, an investigative journalist in the UK. Scott Jones had traced many of the people who were at Brian Jones' house the night he died plus unseen police files held at the National Archives. According to Trevor Hobley, chairman of the Brian Jones Fan Club, a neighbour saw a large bonfire on Jones' estate in which documentation was being burned on the morning of Jones' death as he was leaving for work at 7 a.m.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

In the ''Mail on Sunday'' in November 2008, Scott Jones said Frank Thorogood killed Brian Jones in a fight and senior police officers covered up the true cause of death. Following the review the Sussex police stated that they would not be reopening the case. They asserted that "this has been thoroughly reviewed by Sussex Police's Crime Policy and Review Branch but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroner's original verdict of 'death by misadventure' was incorrect."&lt;ref&gt;"Death of Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones case will not reopen despite new evidence which suggests he was murdered", ''Mail on Sunday'', 31 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songwriting credits==
Unsure and insecure as a composer, Jones was not a prolific songwriter. The 30-second "[[Rice Krispies]]" jingle for [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]], co-written with the [[J. Walter Thompson]] advertising agency in 1963 and performed by The Rolling Stones incognito was credited to Jones; this did not sit well with the rest of the band, who felt it was a group effort and all should benefit equally.&lt;ref name="wymanp90"&gt;Wyman 2002. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was also included in the "[[Nanker Phelge|Nanker/Phelge]]" songwriting credit, a pseudonym used on fourteen tracks that were composed by the entire band and Andrew Oldham.

According to Andrew Oldham, the main reason for Jones' not writing songs was that Jones, being a blues purist, did not love simple pop music enough. Oldham tried to establish a songwriting partnership between Jones and [[Gene Pitney]] after "becoming bored senseless by Jones' bleating about the potential of half-finished melodies that by no means deserved completion", but after two days of sessions "the results remain best to be unheard, even by Rolling Stones' completists".&lt;ref&gt;Oldham (2005). p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in 1965 if he had written songs, Jones replied: "Always tried. I've written quite a few, but mostly in blues style".&lt;ref&gt;''NME New Musical Express'', December 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Many years later after his death, Keith Richards stated: "No, no, absolutely not. That was the one thing he would never do. Brian wouldn't show them to anybody within the Stones. Brian as far as I know never wrote a single finished song in his life; he wrote bits and pieces but he never presented them to us. No doubt he spent hours, weeks, working on things, but his paranoia was so great that he could never bring himself to present them to us".&lt;ref&gt;''Guitar Player'' magazine, May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} In 1995, Mick Jagger told ''Rolling Stone'' magazine that Jones had been jealous of the Jagger/Richards songwriting team, and added: "To be honest, Brian had no talent for writing songs. None. I've never known a guy with less talent for songwriting."&lt;ref name="jaggerremembers" /&gt;

[[Marianne Faithfull]] reported that Jones wrote an early version of the melody for "[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]" and presented it to the group. [[Victor Bockris]] reported that Keith Richards and Brian Jones worked out the final melody in the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Bockris, Keith Richards, Dutch translation, 1993, p.93-94&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Jones is credited (along with Keith Richards) for the instrumental piece "Hear It". However, in 1966 Jones composed, produced, and played on the soundtrack to ''[[Mord und Totschlag]]'' (English title: ''A Degree Of Murder''), an avant-garde German film with Anita Pallenberg, adding the majority of the instrumentation to the soundtrack.

The only known released Brian Jones song is "(Thank You) For Being There", which reportedly is a poem by Jones put to music by [[Carla Olson]]. It appeared on the 1990 album ''True Voices'' as performed by [[Natural Acoustic Band#Krysia Kocjan .28Krysia Kristianne.29|Krysia Kristianne]] and [[Robin Williamson]].

In summer 1968, Jones recorded the Morocco-based ensemble, the [[Master Musicians of Joujouka]] ([[Jajouka]]), which was later used by the band; the recording was released in 1971 as ''[[Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka]]''. Jagger and Richards visited [[Jajouka]] in 1989 after recording "Continental Drift" for the Rolling Stones album ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' with [[The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar]] in Tangier. A homage to Jones entitled "Brian Jones Joujouka very Stoned", painted by [[Mohamed Hamri]], who had brought Jones to Jajouka in 1967, appeared on the cover of ''[[Joujouka Black Eyes]]'' by the Master Musicians of Joujouka in 1995, this being a splinter group created by an Irish friend of the former and estranged Moroccan manager, Mohamed Hamri.{{Verify source|date=October 2008}}

''Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Jajouka'' was rereleased in co-operation with Bachir Attar and Philip Glass in 1995. The executive producers were Philip Glass, Kurt Munkacsi and Rory Johnston, with notes by [[Bachir Attar]], [[Paul Bowles]], [[William S.

I saw him as the leader. He didn't take no mess. He was a fantastic cat; he handled the group beautifully."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wyman |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Wyman|title=Stone Alone: The Story of a Rock 'n' Roll Band|edition=First |year=1990|publisher=[[Viking]]|isbn=0-306-80783-1|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones' death at 27 was the first of the 1960s rock movement; [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], and [[Jim Morrison]] found their own drug-related deaths at the same age within two years (Morrison died two years to the day after Jones). The coincidence of ages has been described as the "[[27 Club]]". When Alastair Johns, who owned Cotchford Farm for over 40 years after Jones' death, refurbished the pool, he sold the original tiles to Jones' fans for £100 each, which paid for half of the work.&lt;ref name="teleg2012"/&gt; Johns noted that Cotchford Farm remained for decades an attraction for Jones' fans.

Songs have been written about Jones: Morrison originally wrote the Doors' song "Tightrope Ride" for Jones, but after Morrison's death [[Ray Manzarek]] rewrote some of the lyrics so that they apply to both musicians.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed, for Morrison having any active role, in the writing of that song.|date=February 2017}} The [[Psychic TV]] song "Godstar" is about Jones' death, as are [[Robyn Hitchcock]]'s "Trash", [[The Drovers]]' "She's as Pretty as Brian Jones Was", [[Jeff Dahl]]'s "Mick and Keith killed Brian", [[Ted Nugent]]'s "Death by Misadventure", and [[Salmonblaster]]'s "Brian Jones". [[Toy Love]]'s song "Swimming Pool" lists several dead rock icons including Jones (the others are Morrison, Hendrix, and [[Marc Bolan]]) just as [[A House]]'s "[[Endless Art]]" does; Jones is also mentioned in [[De Phazz]]'s song "Something Special". [[The Master Musicians of Joujouka]] song "Brian Jones Joujouka Very Stoned" was released in 1974 and 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"Return to Joujouka, BBC Radio 4, 29 August 2000, Master Musicians of Joujouka, "Joujouka Black Eyes, Le Coeur Du Monde 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The band [[Tigers Jaw]] heavily references Jones and his death in their song "I Saw Water". English group [[Ultimate Painting]] recorded [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oopzYgvydg "Song For Brian Jones"] for their 2016 album ''Dusk''.

Many of his contemporaries admit to idolising him as young musicians, including [[Noel Redding]], who, according to [[Pamela Des Barres]]' book ''I'm With the Band'', contemplated suicide after hearing about his death.

[[The Brian Jonestown Massacre]], an American [[psychedelic rock]] band, take their name partly from Jones and are heavily influenced by his work.

The 2005 film ''[[Stoned (film)|Stoned]]'' is a fictional account of Jones and his role in the Rolling Stones. The part of Brian was played by English actor [[Leo Gregory]].

A fictionalised version of Jones and the tribute concert to him appears in [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century]]'' in its second issue, "Paint it Black".

His exceptional musicianship as well as contribution to the band is featured heavily in the documentary ''[[Crossfire Hurricane]]''.

'''Canassatego''' (c. 1684–1750) was a leader of the [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] nation who became a prominent diplomat and spokesman of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] in the 1740s. He was involved in several controversial land sales to [[British America]]n officials. He is now best known for a speech he gave at the 1744 [[Treaty of Lancaster]], where he recommended that the British colonies emulate the Iroquois by forming a confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Ellen Holmes. "[http://www.teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24099 Iroquois and the Founding Fathers]." [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]. Accessed 13 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He was reportedly assassinated, perhaps by sympathizers or agents of [[New France]].

== Early career ==
Canassatego only appears in historical documents for the final eight years of his life, and so little is known of his background.&lt;ref name="Starna145"&gt;Starna, 145.&lt;/ref&gt; His earliest documented appearance is at a treaty conference in [[Philadelphia]] in 1742,&lt;ref name="Starna145" /&gt; where he was a spokesman for the [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] people, one of the six nations of the [[Iroquois]] (Haudenosaunee) League. According to most modern scholars, Canasatego was apparently not one of the fourteen Onondaga hereditary [[sachem]]s who sat on the [[Grand Council of the Six Nations|Iroquois Grand Council]].&lt;ref name="Starna145" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenton, 411.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, 82–3.&lt;/ref&gt; One modern source disagrees, however, maintaining that Canasatego held the League title of [[Tadadaho]].&lt;ref name="Johansen91"&gt;Johansen, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pennsylvania land purchases.png|thumb|350px|This map shows Pennsylvania's land purchases from Native Americans. Canasatego had a role in the 1736 and 1749 sales, although his people had a questionable claim to those lands.]]

In the 1730s, a faction of Iroquois leaders opened a diplomatic relationship with the British [[Province of Pennsylvania]], facilitated by [[Conrad Weiser]], Pennsylvania's interpreter and agent. Pennsylvania agreed to recognize the Iroquois as the owner of all Indian lands in Pennsylvania; the Iroquois, in turn, agreed to sell lands only to Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Starna148"&gt;Starna, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Canasatego probably attended a 1736 treaty where some Iroquois chiefs sold land along the [[Susquehanna River]] to Pennsylvania, even though the Iroquois did not really have a claim to this land.&lt;ref name="Starna148" /&gt;

Canassatego served as the speaker for Onondagas at another conference in 1742, where the Iroquois chiefs collected the final payment for the 1736 land sale. At this meeting, Canassatego managed to convince Governor [[Thomas Penn]] to pay more than the original purchase price. Penn, for his part, urged Canassatego to remove the [[Lenape|Delaware Indians]] from the land purchased in the controversial [[Walking Purchase]] of 1737. Canassatego complied, berating the Delawares as "women" who had no right to sell land, and ordering them to leave. "You are women; take the Advice of a Wise Man and remove immediately", he told the Delawares.&lt;ref&gt;Starna, 151–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The Iroquois designation of the Delawares as "women" has been the subject of much scholarly writing.

==Lancaster treaty==
In 1744, Canassatego served as a speaker at the [[Treaty of Lancaster]]. [[Witham Marshe]], a [[Province of Maryland|Marylander]] in attendance, recorded the only written description of Canassatego:

{{quote|The first of these sachems (or chiefs) was a tall, wellmade man; had a very full chest, and brawny limbs. He had a manly countenance, mixed with a good-natured smile. He was about 60 years of age; very active, strong, and had a surprising liveliness in his speech, which I observed in the discourse betwixt him, Mr. Weiser, and some of the sachems.&lt;ref&gt;Starna, 144. See [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA179&amp;id=EyoTAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Witham Marshe's Journal], ''Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society'' (Boston, 1801), 1st series, 7:179. In Johansen, these words are misattributed to [[Richard Peters (priest)|Richard Peters]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the treaty conference were representatives of the Iroquois nations (except the Mohawks), and the provinces of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]]. With [[King George's War]] underway, the British colonies needed to cultivate a good relationship with their Iroquois neighbors, who might otherwise become French allies. After a speech by Canassatego, officials from Maryland and Virginia agreed to pay the Iroquois for land in their colonies, even though they knew that the Iroquois had no legitimate claim to those lands.&lt;ref&gt;Starna, 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia got the better part of the deal, however: although Canassatego and other Iroquois leaders believed that they had sold only the [[Shenandoah Valley]] to Virginia, the official deed gave Virginia much more land than that.&lt;ref&gt;Starna, 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the conference, Canassatego gave the colonists some advice:

{{quote|We have one thing further to say, and that is We heartily recommend Union and a Good Agreement between you our Brethren. Never disagree, but preserve a strict Friendship for one another, and thereby you as well as we will become the Stronger.

Our wise Forefathers established Union and Amity between the Five Nations; this has made us formidable, this has given us great weight and Authority with our Neighboring Nations.

We are a powerful confederacy, and, by your observing the same Methods our wise Forefathers have taken, you will acquire fresh Strength and Power; therefore, whatever befalls you, never fall out with one another.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Canassatego was concerned that the British colonies lacked a coordinated policy to deal with the military threat coming from [[New France]]. He made similar recommendations about colonial unity at another conference in 1745.&lt;ref&gt;Starna, 156–57.&lt;/ref&gt; His words became a central part of the Iroquois Influence Thesis, the controversial proposal that the Iroquois League was a model for the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalter, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
Canassatego's final appearance at a treaty conference was in August 1749, one year after the end of King George's War.&lt;ref&gt;Starna, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; In Philadelphia, he complained that colonists were settling on Native land along the Susquehanna River. He agreed to sell this land to Pennsylvania, but once again, the written document ceded much more land than what had been agreed upon in negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Starna, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canassatego was reportedly assassinated with poison in September 1750.&lt;ref&gt;Starna, 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt; There were several contemporary rumors about why he was killed. Some said that he was killed for taking bribes in exchange for selling lands. Another rumor maintained that he had been poisoned by agents of New France. Historian William Starna argued that Canassatego was probably assassinated by pro-French Iroquois who wanted to repudiate Canassatego's diplomatic ties with Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Starna, 161–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
After his death, a fictional version of Canasatego appeared in the 1755 novel ''Lydia: or Filial Piety'', by English writer [[John Shebbeare]]. Following a literary convention where Native Americans were used to satirize Europeans, Canassatego was portrayed as wise and honest, in stark contrast to the scheming Englishmen he encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

USS ''Canassatego'' (YN-38/YNT-6/YTM-732), a medium harbor tug of the US Navy, was named for Canasatego.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

{{distinguish|Computability logic}}
'''Computational logic''' is the use of [[logic]] to perform or reason about [[computation]]. It bears a similar relationship to [[computer science]] and engineering as [[mathematical logic]] bears to [[mathematics]] and as [[philosophical logic]] bears to [[philosophy]]. It is synonymous with "[[logic in computer science]]".

The term “Computational Logic” came to prominence with the founding of the [[ACM Transactions on Computational Logic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://tocl.acm.org official website of ACM Transactions on Computational Logic&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term was apparently introduced by J.A. Robinson in a 1970 paper in the Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Machine Intelligence Workshop, Edinburgh, 1970, entitled "Computational Logic: The Unification Computation" (Machine Intelligence 6:63-72, Edinburgh University Press, 1971). The expression is used in the second paragraph with a footnote claiming that *computational logic* (the emphasis is in the paper) is "surely a better phrase than 'theorem proving', for the branch of artificial intelligence which deals with how to make machines do deduction efficiently". This sounds like coining the term; no reference to a previous use is mentioned. In 1972 the Metamathematics Unit at the University of Edinburgh was renamed “The Department of Computational Logic” in the School of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;ref name="uni"&gt;http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bundy/ Professor [[Alan Bundy]]'s website&lt;/ref&gt; The term was then used by [[Robert S. Boyer]] and [[J Strother Moore]], who worked in the Department in the early 1970s, to describe their work on [[program verification]] and [[automated reasoning]]. They also founded a company [http://www.computationallogic.com/ Computational Logic Inc.] of the same name.

The term “Computational Logic” has also come to be associated with [[logic programming]], because much of the early work in logic programming in the early 1970s also took place in the Department of Computational Logic in Edinburgh. It was reused in the early 1990s to describe work on extensions of logic programming in the EU Basic Research Project “Compulog” and in the associated Network of Excellence. Krzysztof Apt, who was the co-ordinator of the Basic Research Project Compulog-II, reused and generalized the term when he founded the ACM Transactions on Computational Logic in 2000 and became its first Editor-in-Chief.

'''Edward Hempstead''' (June 3, 1780 &amp;ndash; August 10, 1817) was an [[United States|American]] lawyer, pioneer, and one of the early settlers in the new [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1805. Born in [[New London, Connecticut]], Hempstead was the delegate in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] for the [[Missouri Territory]] from 1812 to 1814. He served as territorial attorney general in Upper Louisiana and in the Missouri Territorial Legislature.

==Accident==
Hempstead was raised in [[Hebron, Connecticut]], where he studied under Rev. Amos Basset. He studied law under Sylvester Gilbert when he was eighteen and was licensed in 1801. He practiced for a year in [[Middlesex, Connecticut]], then two years in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], then was admitted to the bar. He moved to [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]], [[Indiana Territory]], in 1804. There, he befriended [[William Henry Harrison]], and assisted with Harrison's government of the [[District of Louisiana]]. When Harrison was replaced with [[James Wilkinson]], Hempstead resigned and moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. Hempstead later served with other Governors of the Louisiana and Missouri Territory, including attorney general.&lt;ref name=sketch&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Thomas H.|authorlink=Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|title=A Memoir of Edward Hempstead|year=1875|publisher=Gazette Book and Job Printing House|place=Galena, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812, the [[Territory of Missouri]] (renamed to avoid confusion with [[Louisiana]]) became entitled to a [[Missouri Territory's at-large congressional district|delegate to Congress]]. Hempstead was elected and served a two-year term, declining re-election. He returned to private law practice. Hempstead alter served in the Missouri Territory General Assembly, rising to Speaker of the House.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;

Hempstead died at his home outside of [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on August 10, 1817, six days after an accident in which he was thrown from his horse. He was buried on his farm, on a  plot which later became part of [[Bellefontaine Cemetery]]. Hempstead's grave is thus among the oldest in the entire cemetery. [[Hempstead County, Arkansas]], is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt. Print. Off. | author=Gannett, Henry | year=1905 | pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hempstead was friends with [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]]. Benton later said that he thought Hempstead would have become Missouri's first senator, had he lived long enough. Benton was with Hempstead when he died and spent the wake with his body. When Benton came home from the wake Benton received a challenge to a [[duel]] with [[Charles Lucas (Missouri)|Charles Lucas]] following a dispute over a court case. Benton replied that he would meet Lucas as soon as Hempstead was buried. The two went on to fight two duels, with Benton ultimately killing Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4nwcAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Charles+Lucas+duel The Life of Thomas Hart Benton By William Montgomery Meigs - J.B. Lippincott Co. - 1904]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emenon''' (or '''Emeno''') was the [[Count of Poitou]] (828–839), [[Count of Périgord|Périgord]] (863–866), and [[Count of Angoulême|Angoulême]] (863–866). 

It is unknown who nominated him count of Poitou, but it was probably [[Pepin I of Aquitaine]], at whose side he had fought against the emperor [[Louis the Pious]]. During his tenure in Poitou, the [[Judith, daughter of Welf|Empress Judith]] was imprisoned in the [[Holy Cross Abbey (Poitiers)|abbey of Sainte-Croix]] at [[Poitiers]] for a while. The country of [[Herbauges]] was taken from him and given in [[benefice]] to [[Ragenold of Neustria]]. When Pepin died, Emenon joined the nobles who proclaimed [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|Pepin II]] king. Louis invaded Aquitaine and took Poitiers, passing Christmas there in 839 and appointed [[Ranulf I of Aquitaine|Ranulf I]] in his place as count. 

Emenon became count of Périgord and Angoulême in 863. He died in battle with [[Landri, Count of Saintes]], who was also killed. 

He married Sancha, daughter of [[Sancho Sánchez of Gascony|Sancho II of Gascony]], and left a son, [[Arnold of Gascony|Arnold]], who became [[duke of Gascony]]. By a second wife, a daughter of [[Odo I, Count of Troyes]], he left two sons: [[Adhemar of Poitou|Adhemar (Aymer)]], who inherited Poitou and Angoulême, and [[Adalelm of Troyes|Adalelm]], who later became [[Count of Troyes]].

'''Gale Ann Benson''' (4 November 1944 – 2 January 1972) was a British [[Model (person)|model]], [[socialite]] and daughter of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Leonard Plugge]]. She was [[Premature burial|buried alive]] and murdered in [[Trinidad]] by activist [[Michael X]] and members of his [[Black Power]] group.&lt;ref name="DailyMail_514916"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-514916/Buried-alive-The-model-socialite-daughter-Tory-MP-fell-charismatic-black-civil-rights-leader.html|title=Buried alive: The model, socialite and daughter of a Tory MP who fell for a charismatic black civil rights leader|last=Moore|first=Victoria|date=16 February 2008 |publisher=''Daily Mail''|accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Benson was born in [[London]] to Leonard and Ann Plugge. Gale had two brothers, Leonard Frank (born 1937), and Greville, her twin. She attended school at the [[Lycée Français]] in London. Later she started modelling, and worked as a DJ for a French radio show.

She married film director Jonathan Benson at the age of 20, but the marriage had difficulties and she moved away to [[Argentina]] when she was 22, in 1967.&lt;ref name="DailyMail_514916"/&gt; Returning to the United Kingdom she started a relationship with [[Black Power]] activist [[Hakim Jamal]], an associate of Michael X. Jamal was an American from [[Boston]] whose previous name was Allen Donaldson. She changed her name to "Hale Kimga", an anagram of her first name and Hakim.

Benson and Jamal moved to [[Guyana]] in 1971, before moving later that year to the commune of Michael X in Trinidad, who had fled the UK while bailed on charges of extortion and robbery.&lt;ref name="DailyMail_514916"/&gt;

==Murder==
On the morning of 2 January 1972, a group of men including Michael X took Benson out for a walk outside the commune. Arriving at a hole in the ground, they started digging until it was about four feet deep. One of the men turned to Benson and asked, "What do you think this is for?" She shrugged, and the man replied, "This is a fresh hole for decomposed bodies". They pushed her in, two of the men attacking her with a [[cutlass]], badly wounding Benson in the chest and throat.&lt;ref name="DailyMail_514916"/&gt; She was buried alive, some of the men jumping on the soil to keep her down until she succumbed. The postmortem later found inhaled dirt in her lungs. It was alleged that Michael X had ordered her death because she was causing "mental strain" to Jamal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YBEQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ypADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4566,3875225&amp;dq=hakim+jamal+murder&amp;hl=en |title=Two Will Hang for Burial Murder |date=18 July 1973 |work=[[The Age]] |accessdate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her badly [[Decomposition|decomposed]] body was found seven weeks later, and eventually two of the men were convicted of her murder, after one of the group turned witness for the prosecution. Stanley Abbott and Edward Chadee were sentenced to death, but one was commuted to life imprisonment. Another of the group drowned at sea, and barber Joseph Skerritt was murdered. Michael X was charged with Benson's murder but never tried; he was sentenced to death for the murder of Skerritt on 21 August 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/22/archives/michael-x-doomed-in-trinidad-murder.html|title=Michael X' Doomed in Trinidad Murder|last=Reuters|date=22 August 1972|publisher=''New York Times''|accessdate=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hanged]] in [[Port of Spain]]'s Royal [[Gaol]] in May 1975. Her lover Hakim Jamal was murdered in the United States in 1973, just over a year after Benson.

==Cultural references==
The movie ''[[The Bank Job]]'' (2008) portrays Michael X as having been in possession of indecent photographs of [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] stored in a bank vault, and using them to blackmail the British establishment. [[Hattie Morahan]] plays Benson, who the movie portrays as a spy whose role is to find any additional photos or negatives Michael X may have. Her brother Frank, however, said the idea Benson was a spy in real life was "ludicrous".&lt;ref name="DailyMail_514916"/&gt;

Benson is a central character in [[Diana Athill]]'s memoir of her friendship with Gale's lover, Hakim Jamal, ''Make Believe: A True Story''.&lt;ref&gt;Athill, Diana, ''Make Believe: A True Story'', [[Sinclair Stevenson]], 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoy fell from the TD Bank Tower (known at the time{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} as the Toronto Dominion Bank Tower).]]
'''Garry Hoy''' (January 1, 1955 – July 9, 1993) was a lawyer for the law firm of [[Holden Day Wilson]] in [[Toronto]] notorious for how he died. In an attempt to prove to a group of prospective [[Articled clerk|articling students]] that the glass windows of the [[Toronto-Dominion Centre]] were unbreakable, Hoy [[autodefenestration|threw himself at a glass wall]] on the 24th storey and fell to his death after the window frame gave way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Barbara |last1=Mikkelson |first2=David P. |last2=Mikkelson |title=Through a Glass, Quickly |url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/freakish/window.asp |work=Snopes |date=21 January 2007 |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

==Death==
Garry Hoy was a respected corporate and securities law specialist in Toronto. He had also completed an engineering degree before studying law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |language=en-US |url=https://www.snopes.com/horrors/freakish/window.asp |title=FACT CHECK: Man Dies Demonstrating Window's Strength |date=3 November 2000 |work=Snopes |access-date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While giving a tour of the Toronto-Dominion Centre to a group of articling students, Hoy attempted to demonstrate the strength of the structure's window glass by slamming himself into a window. He had apparently performed this stunt many times in the past, having previously bounced harmlessly off the glass. However, in this instance the force of Hoy slamming into the window forced the window from its frame, causing the intact window and Hoy to fall from the building. The event occurred in a small conference room adjacent to a boardroom where a reception was being held for new articling students.

Structural engineer Bob Greer was quoted by the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' as saying "I don’t know of any building code in the world that would allow a 160-pound (72.5 kg) man to run up against a glass and withstand it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |language=en-US |url=https://torontoist.com/2013/01/urban-legends-the-leaping-lawyer-of-bay-street/ |title=Toronto Urban Legends: The Leaping Lawyer of Bay Street |first=Patrick |last=Metzger |publisher=Torontoist |date=3 January 2013 |access-date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another interview, the firm's spokesman mentioned that the glass in fact did not break, but popped out of its frame, leading to Hoy's fatal plunge.

Hoy's death contributed to the closing of Holden Day Wilson in 1996, at the time the largest law firm closure in Canada.&lt;ref name=GM031407&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/law-firm-goodman-and-carr-shutting-down/article747414/ |title=Law firm Goodman and Carr shutting down |first=Jaquie |last=McNish |work=The Globe and Mail |date=14 March 2007 |accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Hoy's experience was recreated by ''[[MythBusters]]'' in the episode "[[List of MythBusters pilot episodes#Pilot 2 – "Vacuum Toilet, Biscuit Bazooka, Leaping Lawyer"|Vacuum Toilet, Biscuit Bazooka, Leaping Lawyer]]", and was featured in numerous other television shows, often with some details changed.

For his unusual death, Hoy was recognized with a [[Darwin Awards|Darwin Award]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Barbara |last1=Mikkelson |first2=David P. |last2=Mikkelson |title=1996 Darwin Awards: Lawyer Aloft |url=http://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin1996-01.html |work=Darwin Awards |date=1996 |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His unusual death was also re-enacted by [[Joseph Fiennes]] in the 2006 movie ''[[The Darwin Awards (film)|The Darwin Awards]]''.

The incident is also recounted in [[Philip Slayton]]'s ''Bay Street: A Novel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Philip |last=Slayton |authorlink=Philip Slayton |title=Bay Street: A Novel |publisher=Oblonsky Editions |year=2014 |isbn=9780993638909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This unusual way to die was recreated in the third episode of the first season of the television series ''[[1000 Ways to Die]]''.
Also recreated on the Television show "Curious And Unusual Deaths" on Discovery Investigation channel.

'''HMT&lt;ref&gt;HMT (His Majesty's Trawler) is a variation on the more commonly used British ship prefix HMS (His Majesty's Ship).&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Bedfordshire'' (FY141)''' was an armed [[naval trawler]] in the service of the [[Royal Naval Patrol Service]] during [[World War II]]. Transferred to the East Coast of the United States to assist the [[United States Navy]] with [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] patrols, she was staffed by a British and Canadian crew. ''Bedfordshire'' was sunk by the {{GS|U-558}} on 11 May 1942 off the coast of [[Ocracoke Island]] in the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]], with the loss of all hands.

==Construction==
''Bedfordshire'' was built as a commercial [[trawling|fishing trawler]] by [[Smiths Dock Company]] of [[South Bank, Middlesbrough|South Bank]], [[Middlesbrough]], England. Launched at [[Teesside]] on 17 July 1935, she was completed in August 1935 and turned over to her owners, Bedfordshire Fishing Company of [[Grimsby]], managed by H. Markham Cook Ltd. ''Bedfordshire'' was {{convert|162.3|ft}} long, with a {{convert|26.7|ft|adj=on}} beam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bedfordshire|series=Smiths Dock Company Yard List for vessels completed between 1930 and 1944|url=http://www.teesbuiltships.co.uk/smiths/19301944/bedfordshire1935.htm|publisher=teesbuiltships.co.uk|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Admiralty]] acquired ''Bedfordshire'' for anti-submarine duty in August 1939.&lt;ref name=uboat.net&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Converted for service as a naval trawler, she was armed with a 4-inch gun, machine guns, and [[depth charge]]s.

==Service in British waters==
Following completion of her conversion in December 1940, HMT ''Bedfordshire'' undertook anti-submarine patrols and escort duty off the southwest coast of England and in the [[Bristol Channel]]. She served in this capacity throughout 1941 and early 1942.&lt;ref name=noaa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/missions/battleoftheatlantic2/bedfordshire.html|series=Battle of the Atlantic Expedition|title=HMT Bedfordshire|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=19 April 2010|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Situation in American waters deteriorates==
After Germany declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941, German U-boats quickly became a deadly threat on the East Coast. The [[United States Navy]] was ill-prepared to defend against submarine warfare, and U-boats found it easy to pick off commercial shipping vessels, which traveled unescorted. The onslaught began with [[Operation Drumbeat]] when 35 Allied ships were sunk by U-boats off the American coast in January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1942, the Royal Navy sent 24 converted trawlers, including ''Bedfordshire'', to assist the United States Navy with anti-submarine patrols along the East Coast.&lt;ref name=Conn&gt;Conn, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bedfordshire'', commanded by Lieutenant Russell Bransby Davis, [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNR]], was assigned to the [[Fifth Naval District]], headquartered at [[Naval Station Norfolk]]. She operated out of [[Morehead City]], [[North Carolina]], primarily in sectors two and three, where she patrolled the waters surrounding the [[Outer Banks]]&lt;ref name=uba4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uboatarchive.net/ESFWarDiaryApr42APP8.htm |title=Eastern Sea Patrol Log |publisher=uboatarchive.net |date=April 1942 |accessdate=26 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823044501/http://www.uboatarchive.net/ESFWarDiaryApr42APP8.htm |archivedate=23 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while U-boats continued to terrorize local shipping.&lt;ref name=Conn /&gt;

==Service on the American coast==
On 16 April 1942, ''Bedfordshire'' along with HMT ''Lady Elsa'', {{HMS|Tourmaline|J339|6}}, and {{USS|Roper|DD-147|6}} conducted patrols in sector two.&lt;ref name= uba4 /&gt; ''Bedfordshire'' and ''Tourmaline'' assisted {{USS|Stringham|DD-83|6}} in the search for survivors of a sunken tanker in sector two on 17 April.&lt;ref name=uba4 /&gt;

The remainder of April was spent patrolling in the vicinity of [[Currituck Island]], [[Hatteras Island]], and Lookout Shoals.&lt;ref name=uba4 /&gt;

On 1 May, a plane reported having spotted a lifeboat some {{convert|255|nmi|km}} east of [[Cape Lookout (North Carolina)|Cape Lookout]], and ''Bedfordshire'' was sent on a search and rescue mission. She was back on patrol in sector three from 7–9 May, after which she returned to Morehead City.&lt;ref&gt;"Eastern Sea Patrol Log". May 1942. Retrieved 26 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

At noon on 10 May ''Bedfordshire'' and HMT ''St Zeno'' departed Morehead City to escort a convoy to Hatteras, arriving safely near midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Some Foreign Field: The story of four British graves on the Outer Banks|first=L.

==Sinking==
On 10 May 1942, ''Bedfordshire'' and HMT ''St Loman'' were dispatched from Morehead City to search for a U-boat believed to be in the vicinity of Ocracoke Island. The ships were spotted by {{GS|U-558||2}}, commanded by ''[[Kapitänleutnant]]'' [[Günther Krech]]. Later in the evening Krech, believing his sub had been detected, fired on ''St Loman'', which spotted the torpedoes and evaded them. The search continued throughout the night. At 05:40 on 11 May 1942, ''U-558'' fired a torpedo at ''Bedfordshire'', missed, and fired a second, which scored a direct hit and sank her immediately. All 37 men aboard were killed.{{sfn|Blair|1996|p=574}}&lt;ref&gt;Hickam, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; A 38th crewman, a young [[Stoker (occupation)|stoker]] named Sam Nutt, had been detained at Morehead City by local police and narrowly missed boarding the ship for her last patrol.&lt;ref name=HTN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harry-tates.org.uk/veteranstales4.htm|title=HMS Bedfordshire one of the 24 British trawlers sent to help the United States|publisher=Harry Tate's Navy|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMT Bedfordshire.jpg|thumb|right|Commemorative plaque at British Cemetery, Ocracoke Island]]
On 14 May, the bodies of two seamen were discovered by a [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guardsman]] on the shores of Ocracoke Island. Their British uniforms offered the first indication that ''Bedfordshire'' may have met her end, and the U-boat menace was presumed to be responsible.&lt;ref name="Hickam, p. 207"&gt;Hickam, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Her fate was confirmed the following year after ''U-558'' was sunk, resulting in the capture of Kapitänleutnant Krech and his ship's diaries.&lt;ref name=HTN /&gt;

==Burials==
The bodies found on 14 May were identified as belonging to Sub-Lieutenant Thomas Cunningham and Ordinary Telegraphist Stanley Craig of the ''Bedfordshire''. They were buried in a small plot next to a cemetery in Ocracoke Village. The [[White Ensign|Royal Navy flag]] draped over Cunningham's coffin was one of several that he himself had given to a local man less than a month earlier for the funeral ceremonies of British seamen.&lt;ref name="Hickam, p. 207"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Runyan, p. 163"&gt;Runyan, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, two additional bodies from the ship washed ashore on Ocracoke. Unidentified, they were also buried in what became known as the Ocracoke Island British Cemetery.&lt;ref name=OBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/2073156/OCRACOKE%20ISLAND%20(BRITISH)%20CEMETERY|title=Ocracoke Island (British) Cemetery|publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On nearby [[Hatteras Island]], the body of a fifth British seaman, unidentifiable but presumed to be from ''Bedfordshire'', washed ashore on 21 May. The month prior, the body of another British sailor from the sunken merchant ship ''San Delfino'' had been buried on Hatteras; the ''Bedfordshire'' sailor's body was interred in an adjacent plot, resulting in a second British Cemetery, formally known as Cape Hatteras Coast Guard Burial Ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/2112362/CAPE%20HATTERAS%20(U.S.%20COAST%20GUARD)%20BURIAL%20GROUND|title=Cape Hatteras (U.S. Coast Guard) Burial Ground|publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late May or early June, a sixth body, belonging to Seaman Alfred Dryden, washed ashore at [[Swan Quarter, North Carolina]]. It was buried in Oak Grove Baptist Cemetery at Creeds, Virginia, with three of the dead from HMT ''Kingston Ceylonite'', sunk by a mine on 15 June 1942, whose bodies washed ashore nearby.&lt;ref name=noaa /&gt;&lt;ref name=OGC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2720081/DRYDEN,%20ALFRED|title=Casualty details: Alfred Dryden|publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
The British Cemeteries on Ocracoke and Hatteras were leased in 1976 in perpetuity to the British government for as long as the interred bodies remain there.&lt;ref name=OBC /&gt; Formal custody is handled by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]], which provides the protocol headstones. Regular maintenance is handled by the US Coast Guard and local residents as a gesture of gratitude and respect to the fallen men and an act of comity to the British government. A Royal Navy flag flies over the cemeteries, and a ceremony is held there each year on 11 May to honor the men of the ''Bedfordshire''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offbeattravel.com/british-cemetery-outerbanks.html Offbeat travel:British Cemetery at Ocracoke, North Carolina]&lt;/ref&gt; The Commonwealth War Graves Commission also provided headstones for the four British servicemen interred in Creeds, Virginia, including Alfred Dryden of the ''Bedfordshire''.&lt;ref name=OGC /&gt;

The crewmen whose bodies were not recovered are honored by name on the Royal Naval Patrol Service Memorial at [[Lowestoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnps.lowestoft.org.uk/memorial/memorial_vessel1.htm|publisher=Royal Naval Patrol Service|title=Royal Naval Patrol Service Memorial by Vessel|accessdate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wreck of the ''Bedfordshire'' was located in 1980 at {{coord|34|10|N|76|41|W|display=inline,title}} at a depth of {{convert|100|ft}}.&lt;ref name=uboat.net /&gt; The site is considered a protected [[war grave]] under the [[Protection of Military Remains Act 1986]]. In 2008 and 2009 the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] led an expedition to document the condition of ships sunk during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. At the request of the British government, the ''Bedfordshire'' wreck site was surveyed by the expedition in 2009.&lt;ref name=noaa /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/maritime/upload/S2S_Fall09.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=East Carolina University|title=Preserving the Memory of the Battle of the Atlantic through Maritime Archaeology|page=19|author=Wagner, John|journal=Stem to Stern|date=January 2010|issue=volume 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July 2015, the ''Bedfordshire'' was listed in the US government's [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20150807.htm|publisher=National Park Service|title=Weekly List for August 7, 2015|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helen Prettyman Arnold''' was a [[silent film]] actress who appeared in motion pictures from 1916–1918.

==Career==
Arnold was a member of the cast of the 1891 production of "Nerves" at the Lyceum Theatre in New York City.
Arnold played Viola Campbell in a 1916 production of ''The Witching Hour'' filmed in [[Flushing, New York]]. The film starred [[C. Aubrey Smith]] and [[Marie Shotwell]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Witching Hour'', https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0007576/, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was an adaptation of a play written by [[Augustus Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;''Attractions At Local Theaters'', [[Washington Post]], Tuesday, March 27, 1917, pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; One review described it as better than the stage drama which preceded it, while retaining the  mood of strangeness. Arnold was said to be "an attractive Viola".&lt;ref&gt;''The Witching Hour At Lyric'', [[Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette]], February 5, 1917, pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1916, Arnold was among the winners of a ''Beauty and Brains'' contest held by ''[[Photoplay]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;''Starland, Stage and Studio, Blue Ribboners'', [[Los Angeles Times]], June 6, 1916, pg. III4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold made ''Two Men and a Woman'' (1917) with [[Christine Mayo]] and [[Rubye De Remer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amusements'', [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]] Tribune and Leader-Press, April 23, 1918, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ivan Film Productions, Inc., release is directed by [[William J. Humphrey]].&lt;ref&gt;''Two Men and a Woman'' (1917), https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0008709/, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

She made two other [[Hollywood]] films, ''[[One Law For Both]]'' (1917) and ''[[The Call of Her People]]'' (1917), which starred [[Ethel Barrymore]]. Her final film credit is for a role in the Italian film ''Il Doppio volto'' (1918).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0036476/ Helen Arnold] at IMDb&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''immortalized cell line''' is a population of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s from a [[multicellular organism]] which would normally not proliferate indefinitely but, due to [[mutation]], have evaded normal [[cellular senescence]] and instead can keep undergoing division. The cells can therefore be grown for prolonged periods ''[[in vitro]]''. The mutations required for immortality can occur naturally or be intentionally induced for experimental purposes. Immortal cell lines are a very important tool for research into the [[biochemistry]] and [[cell biology]] of multicellular organisms. Immortalised cell lines have also found uses in [[biotechnology]].

An immortalized cell line should not be confused with [[stem cell]]s, which can also divide indefinitely, but form a normal part of the development of a multicellular organism.

==Relation to natural biology and pathology==
There are various immortal cell lines. Some of them are normal cell lines (e.g. derived from stem cells). Other immortalised cell lines are the ''[[in vitro]]'' equivalent of [[cancer]]ous cells. Cancer occurs when a [[somatic cell]] which normally cannot divide undergoes mutations which cause de-regulation of the normal [[cell cycle]] controls leading to uncontrolled proliferation. Immortalised cell lines have undergone similar mutations allowing a cell type which would normally not be able to divide to be proliferated ''in vitro''. The origins of some immortal cell lines, for example [[HeLa]] human cells, are from naturally occurring cancers.

==Role and uses==
Immortalized cell lines are widely used as a simple model for more complex biological systems, for example for the analysis of the [[biochemistry]] and [[cell biology]] of [[mammalian]] (including [[human]]) cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cell lines|journal=Spermatogenesis|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–5|pmc=3341241|year=2012|author1=Kaur|first1=G|last2=Dufour|first2=J. M|doi=10.4161/spmg.19885|pmid=22553484}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of using an immortal cell line for research is its immortality; the cells can be grown indefinitely in culture. This simplifies analysis of the biology of cells which may otherwise have a limited lifetime.

Immortalized cell lines can also be cloned giving rise to a [[clonal population]] which can, in turn, be propagated indefinitely. This allows an analysis to be repeated many times on genetically identical cells, which is desirable for repeatable scientific experiments. The alternative, performing an analysis on primary cells from multiple tissue donors, does not have this advantage.

Immortalized cell lines find use in biotechnology, where they are a cost-effective way of growing cells similar to those found in a multicellular organism ''in vitro''. The cells are used for a wide variety of purposes, from testing [[toxicity]] of compounds or drugs to production of eukaryotic proteins.

===Limitations===

====Changes from nonimmortal origins====
While immortalized cell lines often originate from a well-known tissue type, they have undergone significant mutations to become immortal. This can alter the biology of the cell and must be taken into consideration in any analysis.  Further, cell lines can change genetically over multiple passages, leading to phenotypic differences among isolates and potentially different experimental results depending on when and with what strain isolate an experiment is conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marx|first=Vivien|date=29 April 2014|title=Cell-line authentication demystified|department=Technology Feature|journal=[[Nat.

====Contamination with other cells====
{{Main|List of contaminated cell lines}}
Many cell lines that are widely used for [[biomedical research]] have been [[Cell culture#Cell line cross-contamination|contaminated]] and overgrown by other, more aggressive cells.

There are several methods for generating immortalized cell lines:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Matin|first2=M. M.|last3=Bahrami|first3=A. R.|last4=Ghasroldasht|first4=M. M.|year=2013|title=Immortality of cell lines: Challenges and advantages of establishment|journal=[[Cell Biol.

# Isolation from a naturally occurring cancer. This is the original method for generating an immortalized cell line. Major examples include human [[HeLa]] cells that were obtained from a [[cervical cancer]], mouse Raw 264.7 cells that were subjected to [[mutagenesis]] and then selected for cells which are able to undergo division.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
# Introduction of a viral gene that partially deregulates the cell cycle (e.g., the adenovirus type 5 E1 gene was used to immortalize the [[HEK 293]] cell line; the [[Epstein-Barr virus]] can immortalize [[B lymphocyte]]s by infection&lt;ref name="pmid6261650"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Henle W, Henle G |title=Epidemiologic aspects of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-associated diseases |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=354 |issue= |pages=326–31 |year=1980 |pmid=6261650 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1980.tb27975.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
# Artificial [[Gene expression|expression]] of key [[protein]]s required for immortality, for example [[telomerase]] which prevents degradation of [[chromosome]] ends during DNA replication in eukaryotes
# [[Hybridoma technology]], specifically used for the generation of immortalized [[antibody]]-producing [[B cell]] lines, where an antibody-producing B cell is fused with a [[myeloma]] (B cell cancer) cell.

===Examples===
There are several examples of immortalized cell lines, each with different properties. Most immortalized cell lines are classified by the cell type they originated from or are most similar to biologically.
* [[3T3 cells]] – a mouse [[fibroblast]] cell line derived from a spontaneous mutation in cultured mouse embryo tissue.
* [[A549 cell]]s – derived from a cancer patient [[lung]] tumor.
* [[HeLa]] cells – a widely used human cell line isolated from cervical cancer patient [[Henrietta Lacks]].
* [[HEK 293 cells]] – derived from human fetal cells. 
* [[Jurkat]] cells – a human [[T lymphocyte]] cell line isolated from a case of leukemia.
* [[Vero cell]]s – a monkey [[kidney]] cell line that arose by spontaneous immortalisation.

The '''Japanese submarine ''I-55''''' was one of three [[Type C submarine|Type C]] [[cruiser submarine]]s of the C3 [[ship class|sub-class]] built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during the 1940s.

==Design and description==
The Type C3 submarines were derived from the earlier C2 sub-class although with fewer [[torpedo tube]]s, an additional [[deck gun]], and less-powerful engines to extend their range. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{Convert|2564|LT|t|0|disp=flip}} surfaced and {{Convert|3644|LT|t|0|disp=flip}} submerged. The submarines were {{convert|108.7|m|ftin|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|9.3|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.1|m|ftin|sp=us}}. They had a diving depth of {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|2350|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|600|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|17.7|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|6.5|kn}} underwater.&lt;ref name=c5&gt;Chesneau, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; On the surface, the ''C3''s had a range of {{convert|27000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}; submerged, they had a range of {{convert|105|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|3|kn}}.&lt;ref name=cd3/&gt;

The boats were armed with six internal bow {{convert|53.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} torpedo tubes and carried a total of 19 [[torpedo]]es. They were also armed with two [[14 cm/40 11th Year Type naval gun|{{convert|140|mm|in|abbr=on}}/40]] deck guns and one twin mount for [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|{{convert|25|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} Type 96]] [[anti-aircraft gun]]s.&lt;ref name=cd3&gt;Carpenter &amp; Dorr, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
Assigned to the defense of the Marianas, during a mission to rescue staff of the 1st Air Fleet on [[Tinian]], she was presumably found and sunk by the [[USS Gilmer (APD-11)|USS ''Gilmer'']] and [[USS William C. Miller (DE-259)|USS ''William C. Miller'']] on 14 July 1944, though some sources claim this sinking was actually the [[Japanese submarine Ro-48|Ro-48]].

See also [[USS Wyman (DE-38)|USS ''Wyman'']] and [[USS Reynolds (DE-42)|USS ''Reynolds'']] references to the sinking of this submarine in which Wyman claims credit for this sinking on 28 July 1944.

In 1733, he was listed as a ''Jagdpfeiffer'' at the Royal court in [[Dresden]].&lt;ref name="Van Boer" /&gt; In 1737&lt;ref name="Fürstenau" /&gt; he was transferred to the [[Hofkapelle]] as a violist with a yearly salary of 400 thaler.&lt;ref name="Eitner" /&gt; From around 1740,&lt;ref name="Van Boer" /&gt; he was also well known as a composer of ballet music which was played during operas, particularly those of Hasse,&lt;ref name="Fürstenau" /&gt; and from 1763 to 1769, he was employed as the director and composer of the Elector's French Theater.&lt;ref name="Van Boer" /&gt; In 1775, Charles Burney said of him "Mr. Adam, a veteran musicien, one of the few remaining performers in the celebrated opera-band, under the direction of Signor Hasse, has established himself a great reputation by his composition of the music to the dances performed at this opera in its most flourishing state".&lt;ref name="Burney" /&gt;

==Works==
Many of Adam's compositions have been lost. Below is a list of his known works which are listed in RISM.&lt;ref name="RISM" /&gt; As well as these, there are several movements of ballet music inserted into operas which also survive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6173">'''Katherine Bellenden''' (1497 &amp;ndash; c.1568) was a courtier working in the wardrobe of [[James V of Scotland]]. Her niece of the same name was similarly employed.

==A family at court==
Katherine was the daughter of Patrick Bellenden a servant of [[Margaret Tudor]] and Mariota Douglas, who was the nurse of James V. Her older brother was the Justice Clerk [[Thomas Bellenden of Auchnoule]], another brother was the priest, poet, and translator [[John Bellenden]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijnsbergen, Theo, 'Literature in Queen Mary's Edinburgh: the Bannatyne Manuscript', in, ''The Renaissance in Scotland'', Brill (1994), p.191-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Katherine married Adam Hopper (d.1529)&lt;ref&gt;Durkan, John, ed., ''Protocol Book of Thomas Foular'', SRS New Series 10 (1985), p.34 no.98, p.49 no.141&lt;/ref&gt; in 1527 receiving a royal gift of £300 as a dowry or "tochter" in thanks for her mother's service,&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol.5 (1903), p.330&lt;/ref&gt;  then [[Francis Bothwell]], who were both merchants and [[List of Lord Provosts of Edinburgh|Provosts of Edinburgh]]. In 1529 Adam and Francis were business partners exporting fish to England.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters &amp; Papers Henry VIII'', vol.4 (1875), no.5059&lt;/ref&gt; Her third husband was [[Oliver Sinclair]], the King's favourite, who was reputed to have caused the Scottish defeat at the [[battle of Solway Moss]].

==Sewing for the Stewarts==
While Katherine worked in the royal wardrobe she bought cambric cloth, Holland cloth, and other materials for making the King's shirts, which she and her colleague Janet Douglas, the King's seamstress, embroidered with gold and silver thread. She sold cloth to the King's tailor, Thomas Arthur, and kept accounts of the King's purse. Janet Douglas, like Katherine, married a prominent courtier, [[David Lyndsay|David Lindsay of the Mount]] a diplomat and poet.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 6, HM General Register House (1905), 298, 380-381, 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1537 Katherine, described as "Master Francis Bothuilis wyfe" delivered 10 ells of purple velvet for use at the funeral of the Queen, [[Madeleine of Valois]].&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', Edinburgh (1905), p.332 ('tyrement': funeral)&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the many payments to "Katherine Bellenden" in the Scottish treasurer's accounts one entry notes Katherine as the spouse of Robert Craig, a servant of the tailor Thomas Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 7 (1907), p.463.&lt;/ref&gt; This was Katherine's namesake niece, daughter of Thomas Bellenden of Auchnoule, married to Robert Craig, later an Edinburgh merchant, and their children included [[John Craig (physician)|John Craig]] the physician and perhaps the lawyer [[Thomas Craig (poet)|Sir Thomas Craig]]. It seems that both Katherines were employed in the royal wardrobe and dealt in luxury fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Margaret H.B., ''A Kindly Place?'', Tuckwell (2002), p.108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family finances==
James V paid Katherine £666-13s-4d in April 1538, this was for 1000 marks which she had lent to the King's mother, [[Margaret Tudor]]. In 1541, Oliver and Katherine with their kinsfolk and their royal wardrobe colleagues, [[John Tennent]] and his wife the royal laundress, Mause Acheson, made a contract 'mortifyng' property, including the rents of part of a property on Edinburgh's [[Royal Mile|Netherbow]] to the west of [[Moubray House]] for priests to say Mass for their souls in [[St Giles Cathedral|St Giles, Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0c_AAAAcAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Laing, David, ed., ''Registrum cartarum Ecclesie Sancti Egidii de Edinburgh'', Bannatyne Club, (1859)] pp.246-253 no.141: ''Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, 1513-1546'', HM General Register House (1883) p.597 no. 2600 (Latin).&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1543, Katherine wrote to the Queen Dowager of Scotland, [[Mary of Guise]], regarding her and her husband's debts. A ship they had invested in had been impounded for sums of money they owed for lands in Orkney and Shetland. Mary of Guise was giving their Orkney lands to [[George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly|George Gordon]], [[Earl of Huntly]]. In Orkney, Oliver Sinclair held the castle of [[Kirkwall]] as his ancestors had done, and  Katherine wrote, 'we think great lack to go from our native rooms which my husband and his surname have held these three or four hundred years.'&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Annie I., ed., ''The Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine'', SHS, (1927), pp.46-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==
Katherine and Adam Hopper had a son, Richard, who was eldest and heir to Adam Hopper after he died in 1530.&lt;ref&gt;''Protocol Book of John Foular, 1528-34'', SRS (1985), 65-6, no.198&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Bothwell was the father of [[Adam Bothwell]], [[Bishop of Orkney]], though it is unclear if Katherine was his mother.

Katherine had two daughters with Oliver Sinclair. Isobel Sinclair married [[James Hamilton (assassin)|James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh]] who assassinated [[Regent Moray]] in 1570. Alison Sinclair married David Hamilton of Monktonmains, brother of Bothwellhaugh. The persons of Isobel Sinclair and her supposed cousin Anne Bothwell are conflated in the Scottish ballad, ''Lady Anne Bothwell's Lament''. Anne Bothwell was the daughter of Adam Bothwell the bishop, and perhaps granddaughter of Katherine Bellenden. The ballad relates to her seduction and abandonment by Alexander Erskine (d.1640), a son of the [[John Erskine, Earl of Mar (1558–1634)|Earl of Mar]]&lt;ref&gt;Maidment, James, ed., ''Scottish ballads and songs, historical and traditionary'', vol. 2, Edinburgh (1868), 39, 41-2, 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life and early wrestling career===
He was born in Brooklyn, New York City in 1926 of [[Italian-American]] heritage. He was fluent in both [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. His wrestling career began in neighboring [[New Jersey]] in 1953. He wrestled under the '''[[Zebra Kid]]''' gimmick, and was billed at the height of 6 foot 6&amp;nbsp;inches. It wasn't long before Montana found success. Along with Golden Terror, he won the New Jersey Tag Team titles on April 4, 1953.&lt;ref name="onlineworldofwrestling.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lenny Montana|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/l/lenny-montana.html|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenny began to travel on the road, wrestling in the [[Midwest]]. He soon won the [[NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship]], defeating Dave Sims on October 1, 1953 in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. However he lost the title on December 11, 1953 to [[Sonny Myers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/sonny-myers.html |title=Sonny Myers |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had held the title a previous three times before defeating the Zebra Kid. His final success of the 1950s came in 1956, winning the [[NWA Texas Tag Team Championship]] with [[Gene Kiniski]], defeating Herb Freeman and [[Ray Gunkel]] on September 18 in [[Dallas]] under the alias Len Crosby.&lt;ref name="onlineworldofwrestling.com"/&gt; He also worked as a [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] during this time to earn extra money.

=== Later wrestling career===
By the late 1950s, Montana was on the road with the [[Carnival]] Circuit as a wrestler. As a popular wrestler within the circuit, Montana met the then unknown [[Eddie Sharkey]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/9893/sharkey2.htm |title=Tom Zenk - first trainer - Eddie Sharkey part 2 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-10-28 |accessdate=2014-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028153230/http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/9893/sharkey2.htm |archivedate=October 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two struck up a friendship. After seeing what Sharkey could do, Montana recommended that he try his hand at professional wrestling. Montana also clued in Sharkey on the then-unacknowledged truth about professional wrestling, that all the outcomes are predetermined. Later on in that year, Montana won the NWA Texas World Tag Team titles with Joe Christie, under the Len Crosby name. Then with [[Hard Boiled Haggerty]], he won the AWA World Tag Team Championship on October 4, 1960, defeating Stan Kowalski and Tiny Mills ( wrestling as Murder Inc.) in [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrestling.johnny-o.net/bios/?id=560 |title=Lenny Montana &amp;#124; Johnny O's Wrestling Website |publisher=Wrestling.johnny-o.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in a match against [[Verne Gagne]], Montana suffered a broken leg, forcing Haggerty to choose a new partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrestling.johnny-o.net/titles/history.php?title=awa_tag |title=A.W.A. World Tag Team &amp;#124; Johnny O's Wrestling Website |publisher=Wrestling.johnny-o.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After recovering from his injury, in 1961 Montana began to wrestle in [[Florida]]. He came to the [[Tampa Bay]] area and began to wrestle under The Zebra Kid alias.&lt;ref name="teddwebb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teddwebb.com/wrestling_hall_of_fame/lenny_montana.html |title=Wrestling Hall Of Fame |publisher=Teddwebb.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his great size, he would often pin his opponents in under one minute.&lt;ref name="teddwebb.com"/&gt; The Zebra Kid had a notable feud with [[Eddie Graham]]; their battles sold out [[Fort Homer Hesterly Armory]] many Tuesday nights in 1961. Things came to a head when Montana defeated Eddie Graham in a [[NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (Georgia version)]] title match on May 1, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1209764213.shtml |title=Wrestling News and Results, WWE News, TNA News, ROH News |publisher=Wrestleview.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 23, 1962, he won the NWA (Georgia) Southern Tag Team Titles with his partner [[Gypsy Joe]], defeating 'Grizzly' Jake Smith and Luke Brown. Montana then went on to form a powerful partnership with [[Tarzan Tyler]], in which they would win three titles. First, the [[NWA International Tag Team Championship (Georgia version)|NWA International Tag Team Titles]] on April 9, 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1209159472.shtml |title=Wrestling News and Results, WWE News, TNA News, ROH News |publisher=Wrestleview.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; defeating Ted Evans and Chief Little Eagle, then again winning the NWA International Tag Team Titles later in June 1963, defeating billed champions Chief Little Eagle and Dick Steinborn. Finally, the duo won the NWA World Tag Team Championship in Georgia, during October 1963, they defeated Karl Von Brauner and Kurt Von Brauner. Montana was due to be Gorilla Monsoon's [[tag team]] partner in 1964, but it never happened due to Monsoon becoming partners with The African Savage at the last minute. Lenny had been interested in acting, and was meeting with casting agents in [[Los Angeles]] at the same time he was due to team up with Bison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buddybison.com/ |title=WELCOME TO THE WEBSITE OF BUDDY BISON aka EXECUTIONER #2 aka HURRICANE CHANDLER |publisher=Buddybison.com |date=2012-08-14 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montana began to wrestle less and less, and went into semi-retirement; however he appeared in matches up until his acting career took off in the early 1970s.

=== Working for the Colombo crime family===
Montana became involved with the [[Colombo crime family]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="frederick"/&gt; Tall and very heavily built, his talents were mostly as an enforcer and an [[arson]]ist. He would tie a [[tampon]] to the tail of a mouse, dip it in [[kerosene]], light it, and let the mouse run through a building, or he would put a [[candle]] in front of a [[cuckoo clock]] so that when the clock's bird would pop out the candle would be knocked over and start a fire.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Seal |first=Mark |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2009/03/godfather200903?currentPage=all |title=The Godfather Wars |publisher=Vanity Fair |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Montana ended up doing time in [[Rikers Island|Riker's Island.]]&lt;ref name=II&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the gangsters still love The Godfather of all movies|date=April 13, 2001|url=http://www.independent.ie/woman/celeb-news/why-the-gangsters-still-love-the-godfather-of-all-movies-26089900.html|work=[[Irish Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon being released, as a friend of the family, Montana would act as a [[bodyguard]] for many of the senior members of the Colombo Family.

=== Work on ''The Godfather''===
The filming of the classic movie ''[[The Godfather]]'' faced strong opposition from the [[Italian-American Civil Rights League]], with disputes headed by [[Joseph Colombo|Joe Colombo]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], threatening its whole production. Producer [[Al Ruddy]] eventually made a deal with the league and Joe Colombo to cut the word Mafia from the script, and the league were behind the production of the film. This meant many mobsters would be present on the set of ''The Godfather''. It was in 1971, when Montana was acting as a bodyguard for a senior Colombo Family member,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/news/leave-the-gun-take-the-cannoli-and-other-godfather-stories.php |title=‘Leave the Gun.

After being introduced to the 6-foot-6, 320-pound Montana, they quickly cast him for the role of [[Luca Brasi]]. When Bettye McCartt, Al Ruddy's assistant, broke her watch, Montana offered to get her a new one. A week later, Montana returned with a "gift from the boys" – an antique diamond watch.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt; He was picked for the part after the original actor playing the character died of a [[stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casperstartribune.net/articles/2006/03/27/news/national/4c88e582fc58a6b88725713e000749f0.txt Casperstartribune.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614050303/http://www.casperstartribune.net/articles/2006/03/27/news/national/4c88e582fc58a6b88725713e000749f0.txt |date=June 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be his first film appearance. His role was that of sadistic mob enforcer Luca Brasi, a [[hitman]] used by [[Vito Corleone|Don Corleone]] ([[Marlon Brando]]). Montana was so nervous about appearing opposite Brando that he kept practicing his lines over and over again. [[Francis Ford Coppola]] rewrote the scene to feature this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nerve.com/CS/blogs/screengrab/archive/2008/09/26/that-guy-special-quot-godfather-quot-edition-part-five.aspx Nerve.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122024650/http://www.nerve.com/CS/blogs/screengrab/archive/2008/09/26/that-guy-special-quot-godfather-quot-edition-part-five.aspx |date=2008-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Montana also suffered an attack of nerves during the scene where his character thanked the Don; Coppola also wrote this into the script as Brasi being overwhelmed by the Don's invitation to his daughter's wedding. He had little screen time in the role of Luca Brasi, but his notable height and physique caught the eye of producers, and he appeared in several movies and television programs after appearing in ''The Godfather''.

=== Film and TV career===
After appearing in ''The Godfather'', Montana was an actor in demand. One of the first of these roles was the Italian [[satire|spoof]] film ''[[The Funny Face of the Godfather]]'' in 1973. Montana had the role of Saro, and an artist's rendition of Montana appeared on the film's poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb96/DaveTyla/lenny21.png|title=i210.photobucket.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established himself as an efficient [[character actor]] and appeared in ''[[Patty (film)|Patty]]'' (1976), ''[[Fingers (1978 film)|Fingers]]'' (1978) as the pizzeria owner Luchino, ''[[Matilda (1978 film)|Matilda]]'' (1978), ''[[They Went That-A-Way &amp; That-A-Way]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=92853&amp;atid=0 |title=They Went That-a-Way &amp; That-a-Way (1978) - Overview |publisher=TCM.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1978), ''[[The Jerk]]'' (1979), ''[[Seven (1979 film)|Seven]]'' (1979), ''Below the Belt'' (1980), ''[[Defiance (1980 film)|Defiance]]'' (1980), ''[[Battle Creek Brawl]]'' (1980) alongside [[Jackie Chan]], ''[[Evilspeak]]'' (1981), ''[[...All the Marbles]]'' (1981), ''[[Pandemonium (film)|Pandemonium]]'' (1982) and ''[[Blood Song]]'' (1982). He also acted on television as well as the big screen, appearing in ''[[Search (TV series)|Search]]'' (1973), ''[[Strike Force (1975 film)|Strike Force]]'' (1975), which starred a young [[Richard Gere]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073758/|title=Strike Force|date=12 April 1975|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Contract on Cherry Street]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075876/|title=Contract on Cherry Street|date=19 November 1977|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1977), which featured [[Frank Sinatra]], ''[[Kojak]]'' (1978), and ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magnum-mania.com/Episodes/Season2/Italian_Ice.html |title=Episode Guide - Italian Ice |publisher=Magnum Mania! |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1982). Montana was usually cast as "muscle" for hire or an intimidating mobster.

=== Retirement and later life===
Montana retired from acting after appearing in the [[B movie]] ''[[Blood Song]]'' (1982), which he also co-wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083660/fullcredits|title=Blood Song (1982)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died May 12, 1992 of a [[heart attack]] in [[Lindenhurst, New York]]. He was 66 years old. His likeness was used as his character Luca Brasi in ''[[The godfather game|The Godfather Game]]''. Terence McGovern provided the voice acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442674/fullcredits|title=The Godfather (Video Game 2006)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montana was survived by his wife Sylvia, four children and twelve grandchildren.

'''''Lusius malfoyi''''' is a [[parasitoid wasp]] found in [[New Zealand]].  The species is named for [[Lucius Malfoy]], a character in the fictional [[Harry Potter]] series of books by [[J.K. Rowling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/10/new-zealand-wasp-named-harry-potter-character-lucius-malfoy/|title=New Zealand wasp named after Harry Potter character Lucius Malfoy|last=Pearlman|first=Jonathan|date=10 Oct 2017|website=The Telegraph|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114025328/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/10/new-zealand-wasp-named-harry-potter-character-lucius-malfoy/|archivedate=14 Jan 2018|dead-url=|accessdate=14 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/10/lusius-malfoyi-wasp-new-zealand-insect-named-after-harry-potter-villain|title=Lusius malfoyi wasp: New Zealand insect named after Harry Potter villain|last=Roy|first=Elanor Ainge|date=10 Oct 2017|website=The Guardian|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119112845/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/10/lusius-malfoyi-wasp-new-zealand-insect-named-after-harry-potter-villain|archivedate=19 Oct 2017|dead-url=|accessdate=14 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although the genus was named in 1903 and was not named for this character.  The species is the first in its genus described in New Zealand; although the [[holotype]] specimen was captured in 1981, it was not described until 2017.  The species is geographically widespread but rare.&lt;ref name = 'Saunders'&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Thomas E. | last1 = Saunders | first2 = Darren F. | last2 = Ward | title = A new species of ''Lusius'' (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) from New Zealand | journal = New Zealand Entomologist | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | date  = 2017 | doi = 10.1080/00779962.2017.1357427 | pages = 72-78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The species is light brown or orange, with unbanded brown antennae. Female body length varies from 4.7 mm to 7.8 mm. Its coloration pattern, as well as its geographic range, distinguish it from other species in the genus. Its host, like that of other ''Lusius'' wasps, is unknown.&lt;ref name='Saunders'/&gt;

== Range ==

The species is known from both [[North Island|North]] and [[South Island|South Islands]] of New Zealand. It is not yet known from offshore islands or other locations, but this is likely due to a lack of sampling. Specimens were collected by [[malaise trap]] in spring to late summer (September through to March) in a wide range of habitats, in or near ''[[Nothofagus]]'' forests and other native forests and brush, from close to sea level up to 850 m.&lt;ref name="Saunders" /&gt; However very few specimens were collected from any one area, so the species appears to be naturally uncommon. It is the only member of the genus ''Lusius'' so far described from Australasia, though this may represent a lack of sampling.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

== Etymology ==

The species was described by Thomas E. Saunders, then a Masters student at the [[University of Auckland]]. He chose the name in order to "redeem the reputation of wasps" in a manner similar to the redemption of Lucius Malfoy's character in the Harry Potter series.&lt;ref name='guardian'/&gt;

'''Man In Space Soonest''' ('''MISS''') was a [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) program to put a [[astronaut|man]] into [[outer space]] before the [[Soviet Union]]. The program was cancelled on August 1, 1958, and was replaced by [[NASA]]'s [[Project Mercury]]. Only two men from the program would actually reach outer space. The first, [[Joseph A. Walker]], did so twice in two [[X-15]] rocket plane tests in 1963. Another, [[Neil Armstrong]], became a [[NASA Astronaut Corps|NASA astronaut]] in 1962 and became the first person to walk on the [[Moon]] in 1969.

== Astronaut candidates ==
[[File:Man in space soonest proposals.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Spacecraft proposals from different companies.]]
MISS would have used a [[Thor (rocket)|Thor]] booster, then later an [[Atlas rocket|Atlas]], to launch a single-man spacecraft into orbit. The Air Force selected on June 25, 1958&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/flights/manonest.htm MISS' selection date] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211165617/http://astronautix.com/flights/manonest.htm |date=2006-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the following nine men to be astronauts for the program:

* [[Neil A. Armstrong]] (1930–2012), 27, [[NACA]]. The only member of the group to join the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]]. Flew on [[Gemini 8]] and [[Apollo 11]] missions; performed the first docking of two spacecraft, was the first - along with [[Buzz Aldrin]] - to land on the [[Moon]], and was the first person to set foot on the Moon.
* [[Bill Bridgeman|William B. Bridgeman]] (1916–1968), 42, [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]
* [[Albert Scott Crossfield|A. Scott Crossfield]] (1921–2006), 36, [[North American Aviation]] (NAA)
* [[Iven C. Kincheloe]] (1928–1958), 29, USAF
* [[John B. McKay]] (1922–1975), 35, NACA
* [[Robert A. Rushworth]] (1924–1993), 33, USAF
* [[Joseph A. Walker]] (1921–1966), 37, NACA. The first member of the group to achieve [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|international astronaut recognition]], and to enter space twice, on two [[X-15]] test flights.
* [[Alvin S. White]] (1918–2006), 39, NAA
* [[Robert Michael White|Robert M. White]] (1924–2010), 33, USAF

{{nihongo|'''Mechagodzilla'''|メカゴジラ|Mekagojira}} is a [[mecha]] that first appeared in the 1974 film ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'' as an extraterrestrial villain opposing [[Godzilla]]. In subsequent iterations, it is depicted as a man-made weapon designed to defend Japan from Godzilla. In all incarnations, Mechagodzilla appears as a robotic [[doppelgänger]] and arch-enemy of Godzilla, boasting a vast array of weaponry.

==Overview==
===Development===
Mechagodzilla was conceived in 1974 as a more serious villain than its immediate two predecessors, [[Gigan]] and [[Megalon]], whose films were considered creative disasters.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=195}}{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=196}}{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=197}} According to [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]], Mechagodzilla was inspired by both [[Mechani-Kong]] from the previous [[Toho]] film ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'' and the [[Mecha anime and manga|robot anime]] genre, which was popular at the time.&lt;ref name="元山掌"&gt;元山掌、松野本和弘、浅井和康、鈴木宣孝 『東宝特撮映画大全集』 ヴィレッジブックス、2012年9月28日。{{ISBN|9784864910132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effects director [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] also felt that a mechanical monster was cheaper to construct than the mutated animals Godzilla had previously faced.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=137}}{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=138}}{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=139}} As the resulting ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'' proved to be a greater critical success than previous 1970s ''Godzilla'' films, the character was revived in 1975's ''[[Terror of Mechagodzilla]]''. The film's screenplay was based on the winning entry of a story-writing competition won by Yukiko Takayama, who continued the darker tone of the previous film by adding the subplot of Mechagodzilla being cybernetically connected to a young woman. Mechagodzilla's design remained largely unchanged from its previous appearance, though it was made to look thinner and more angular, with a darker sheen and an MG2 insignia emblazoned on its upper arms. The film's original draft was going to have Mechagodzilla destroy Tokyo utterly, though the destruction was cut down for budgetary reasons.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=200-6}}
[[File:Heisei Godzilla Perfection - Berserk.jpg|thumb|right||Early concept art of Mechagodzilla's Heisei incarnation, dubbed "Berserk"]]

Mechagodzilla was brought back in 1993's ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II]]'', as the success of ''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]'' and the popularity of its main antagonist [[Mothra]] spurred Toho into reintroducing familiar characters rather than inventing new ones.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=287-93}} Originally, the new Mechagodzilla was to be named "Berserk", and was envisioned as being a much more organic Godzilla-like creature which would later turn on its creators after becoming infected with a [[computer virus]] which makes it self-aware. Berserk would subsequently absorb more and more machinery, to the point of degenerating into a mass of metal and wires, though this concept was rejected early in pre-production.&lt;ref name="kawakita"&gt;{{cite book |title=平成ゴジラパーフェク [Heisei Godzilla Perfection]|last=Kawakita|first=Koichi |year=2012 |publisher=Dengeki Hobby Books |isbn=4048861190 |pages=|language=jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Mechagodzilla was intended to be a military defense weapon rather than an alien construct, the character was redesigned as looking sleeker and smoother.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=287-93}} It was portrayed by suit actor [[Wataru Fukuda]], and consisted of multiple separate elements which were worn like plate armor. Special effects artist [[Koichi Kawakita]] originally envisioned Mechagodzilla being able to split into aerial and terrestrial units, though this idea was scrapped in favor of the character merging with the flying battleship Garuda. The film was promoted through the children's program ''Adventure Godzilla-land'', which portrayed Godzilla and Mechagodzilla as rival news anchors reporting on the events of the upcoming movie.&lt;ref name="kalat2010.2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=196–201|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composer [[Akira Ifukube]] wrote a theme for Mechagodzilla incorporating a slow battle march with heavy percussion and [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic phrasing]].{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=287-93}}

The decision to incorporate Mechagodzilla into the Millennium series was taken by producer [[Shōgo Tomiyama]], who gave the general outline of what would become the story of ''[[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]'' to ''[[Godzilla vs. Megaguirus]]'' director Masaaki Tezuka.&lt;ref name="tezuka2014"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0toUtvfWMPg "Tokyo SOS Director EXTRA / 東京SOSの監督〜EXTRA〜 (SciFi Japan TV #27)"], ''CHO Japan'' (September, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Tezuka instructed his staff to research both [[cybernetics]] and DNA engineering in order to make the character scientifically plausible. Tezuka had initially wanted Mechagodzilla to be a much speedier robot than the one on film, envisioning it as becoming progressively agiler during its fight against Godzilla as the latter tore off its opponent's armaments. This incarnation of Mechagodzilla was deliberately shown being airlifted by carriers rather than flying directly into battle as the previous two incarnations had done, as Tezuka felt that it made little sense for Mechagodzilla to drain its energy in such a manner. Upon being asked why the Mechagodzilla suit wasn't painted with [[military camouflage]] colors, Tezuka answered that "Mechagodzilla doesn't need to hide."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henshinonline.com/tezuka-mimura.html "Interview: Masaaki Tezuka and Wataru Mimura"], ''henshionline'' (accessed 2016-26-05)&lt;/ref&gt; Tezuka had originally intended to have both Godzilla and Mechagodzilla die at the end of the film, but was forced to change this on the insistence of Toho managers, who felt that such an ending was too dark for a [[New Year]] movie release.&lt;ref name="tezuka2014"/&gt;

In the 2003 sequel ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'', creature designer Shinichi Wakasa used the same mold to create a redesigned Mechagodzilla, which was meant to look more weathered than its predecessor. According to production designer Shinki Nishikawa, several other changes were made to the Mechagodzilla design's head, chest and arms in order to make the character look less heroic and more machine-like. The robot's back unit was reduced in size and flipped upside down, and the head was made smaller. As the previous design's shoulder cannons were considered uneven and unsophisticated-looking because of their rectangular shape, special effects director Eiichi Asada made them more pentagonal. As the character was supposed to rely more on its forearm cannons than in the previous film, Nishikawa made them larger and more powerful looking.&lt;ref&gt;"Godzilla X Mothra X Mechagodzilla: Tokyo SOS production report - The men behind the monsters discuss the latest Godzilla film", ''Uchusen'' #108 (Asahi Sonorama) (October 22, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mechagodzilla 1974.png|thumb|Shōwa Mechagodzilla]]

===Shōwa (1974–1975)===
In ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'', Mechagodzilla is created as a weapon of destruction by the alien [[Alien races from the Godzilla films#The Simians|Simians]], who intend to conquer Earth before their own homeworld gets destroyed by an expanding [[black hole]]. First appearing in a pseudo-flesh outer covering and masquerading as the real Godzilla, Mechagodzilla attacks Japan and overpowers Godzilla's ally [[Anguirus]]. Godzilla appears and destroys the pseudo-flesh disguise, forcing Mechagodzilla to reveal itself in full. Their initial battle results in a tie, as Godzilla is severely wounded and Mechagodzilla is forced back into the Simian's base for repair. Mechagodzilla is deployed again but is overpowered through the combined efforts of Godzilla and [[King Caesar]]. Godzilla ultimately defeats Mechagodzilla by decapitating it and blowing its body apart.

The Simians return and rebuild Mechagodzilla in ''[[Terror of Mechagodzilla]]''. This time, it is further modified with living human brain cells and has its control circuitry integrated into the body of the human woman Katsura Mafune, who is a [[cyborg]] courtesy of the aliens. Mechagodzilla is teamed up with the dinosaur [[Titanosaurus (Godzilla)|Titanosaurus]], who is controlled by Katsura's crazed father. Although Mechagodzilla survives another decapitation during a battle against Godzilla, it is once more defeated after Katsura commits suicide, destroying the robot's controls and freezing it long enough for Godzilla to use its atomic heat ray on Mechagodzilla's headless body, causing it to explode.
[[File:Heisei Mechagodzilla.png|thumb|Heisei Mechagodzilla]]

===Heisei (1993)===
In ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II]]'', Mechagodzilla is built as an anti-Godzilla weapon by the United Nations Godzilla Countermeasures Center using 23rd century technology [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] from the remains of [[King Ghidorah|Mecha-King Ghidorah]]. Mechagodzilla overpowers Godzilla in Kyoto, but is rendered harmless by a voltage backsurge caused by Godzilla. Mechagodzilla is recovered and merged with the smaller airship Garuda to form {{nihongo|'''Super-Mechagodzilla'''|スーパーメカゴジラ|Supa-Mekagojira}}. This combined mecha later fights both [[Rodan|Fire Rodan]] and Godzilla. It proceeds to cripple Godzilla by destroying its secondary brain and mortally wounds Rodan. Rodan then sacrifices its energy to revive Godzilla, who then uses its new red spiral atomic breath to destroy the weakened Super-Mechagodzilla.

In ''[[Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla]]'', it is revealed that Mechagodzilla's remains were salvaged and used to construct [[Moguera]].
[[File:Millennium Mechagodzilla.png|thumb|Millennium Mechagodzilla]]

===Millennium (2002–2003)===
The Millennium incarnation is featured in two films: ''[[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]'' and ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' and is referenced as {{nihongo|'''Kiryu'''|機龍|Kiryū}}, derived from '''Kikai ryu''' (Japanese for "machine dragon"). When a second Godzilla appears in 1999, the Japanese military create a Mechagodzilla codenamed Kiryu, built around the skeleton of the original Godzilla from 1954. During its first battle with Godzilla four years later in 2003, Kiryu's genetic memories of its 1954 incarnation are awakened, and it proceeds to attack Tokyo, free from the controls of its pilot until its power drains. During its second battle with Godzilla, Kiryu forces Godzilla to retreat after using its Absolute Zero Cannon.

In ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'', taking place one year later in 2004, [[Mothra]]'s fairies warn Japan that Kiryu's creation is a violation of the natural order, and that Mothra would gladly take the cyborg's place in protecting Japan, should Kiryu be dismantled. The ultimatum is declined, as Kiryu was built partially to defend against a second attack from Mothra herself. Godzilla eventually appears, prompting Mothra and Kiryu to cooperate with each other. Kiryu momentarily is forced to fight Godzilla alone after Mothra is killed, but is later assisted by Mothra's larvae, who encase Godzilla in a cocoon, and Kiryu is given orders to terminate him. However, Kiryu's soul is awakened once again, and it instead submerges Godzilla and itself in the middle of the ocean (though not before ejecting its human occupant to safety).

===Anime trilogy (2017-2018)===
Mechagodzilla appears briefly in ''[[Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters]]'', the first film in the anime trilogy. The mech is designed as a countermeasure against Godzilla, but was never activated; humanity and their allies flee into outer space and abandon Mechagodzilla and their other countermeasures. Though not seen again, the mech is referenced several other times throughout the film. In ''[[Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle]]'', the second film in the trilogy, the remnants of Mechagodzilla's AI rebuilt the facility it was created in by utilizing nanometal to help defeat Godzilla, aptly named "Mechagodzilla City". Haruo and his forces used the city as a based operation to destroy Godzilla.

===Arsenal===
[[File:Mechagodzilla Absolute Zero.png|thumb|The Millennium Mechagodzilla's Absolute Zero Cannon featured in ''Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla'' (2002)]]
The Showa Mechagodzilla stands 50 meters in height and weighs 40,000 metric tons.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=196}} It is built from "space [[titanium]]", and is capable of launching missiles from its fingers, toes and knees, as well as firing energy beams from its eyes and chest unit. Its head can spin 360°, and can form a [[force field (fiction)|force field]] capable of repelling and shocking opponents.&lt;ref name="GvMG"&gt;''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'' (1974). Directed by [[Jun Fukuda]]. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt; The upgraded model featured in ''Terror of Mechagodzilla'' included revolving missiles, and was no longer vulnerable to decapitation, as its main computer was housed in an external power source.&lt;ref name="ToMG"&gt;''[[Terror of Mechagodzilla]]'' (1975). Directed by [[Ishirō Honda]]. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heisei Mechagodzilla stands 120 meters in height, weighs 150,000 metric tons, and is powered by a [[nuclear reactor]], deriving its energy from [[heavy hydrogen]] and [[helium-3]] in pellet form. Its frame is coated in an armor made of synthetic diamond codenamed T-1, allowing the robot to resist and repel Godzilla's atomic ray, as well as absorb its power to energize its "Plasma Grenade", an energy weapon housed in its abdomen. Additional armaments include a "Laser Cannon" and "Mega Buster" ray fired from the eyes and mouth respectively, and shock anchors capable of piercing Godzilla's hide and electrocuting him. The model is later combined with the flying battleship Garuda, thus allowing it to hover and adding two additional laser cannons to its arsenal.&lt;ref name="GvMGII"&gt;''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II]]'' (1993). Directed by [[Takao Okawara]]. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Millennium Mechagodzilla stands at 60 meters in height, weighs 40,000 metric tons, and is piloted remotely from a control craft, and can be remotely recharged from the ground using microwaves that are relayed through a power system on one of the command aircraft, and then beamed back down to the robot. Its armaments include an oral [[maser]] cannon, arm-mounted laser guns and a flight pack containing rocket launchers. Its deadliest, but most energetically costly weapon is the Absolute Zero cannon housed in its chest, which fires a beam capable of [[flash freezing]] enemies and disintegrating them.&lt;ref name="GaMG"&gt;''[[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]'' (2002). Directed by Masaaki Tezuka. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'', the Absolute Zero Cannon is replaced with a "Triple Hyper Maser Cannon".&lt;ref name="GTSOS"&gt;''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' (2003). Directed by Masaaki Tezuka. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anime Trilogy Mechagodzilla stands 50 meters in height, weighs 30,000 metric tons, and is powered by artificial intelligence and made from nanometal. In the novel: ''Project Mechagodzilla'', its arsenal inclues Blade Launcher, Convergent Neutron Cannon, Flight, Hyper Lance, Thermal Energy Buffer Layer, and Tail Blow. When it form Mechagodzilla city, the defenses include gun cannons, EMP Harpoons, and a force field to protect itself when fire upon.

===Reception===
The character has generally been positively received. It was rated #15 of the 50 Best Movie Robots by ''[[The Times]]'', beating other such legends as [[C-3PO]] from ''[[Star Wars]]'', the [[T-1000]] from ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', and [[Optimus Prime]] from ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Moran|title=The 50 best movie robots|publisher=The Times|date=2007-07-25|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article2133609.ece|accessdate=2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WatchMojo.com]] listed Mechagodzilla as #2 on their "Top 10 Godzilla Villains" list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4zR__HFvn0|title=Top 10 Godzilla Villains|last=WatchMojo.com|first=|work=YouTube|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' listed the character as #6 on its "The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time" list,&lt;ref&gt;Josh Robertson, [http://uk.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/05/most-badass-kaiju-monsters-of-all-time/ "The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time"], ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' (May 18, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; while [[IGN]] listed it as #4 on their "Top 10 Japanese Movie Monsters" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/15/top-10-japanese-movie-monsters?page=2|title=Top 10 Japanese Movie Monsters|last=Hawker|first=Tom|work=IGN|date=May 15, 2014|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
The various incarnations of Mechagodzilla has appeared in other media associated with the series, such as video games, television shows or comics. In the 5th-season episode of ''[[30 Rock (season 5)|30 Rock]]'', "Chain Reaction of Mental Anguish", Kiryu appears as one of the characters in a theme restaurant.

In [[Ernest Cline]]'s novel ''[[Ready Player One]]'' and its [[Ready Player One (film)|film adaptation]], the main antagonist controls a full size Mechagodzilla replica during the climatic battle in a virtual reality environment. In the book, it is the Kiryu model that fights against [[Ultraman]]. In the movie, it is an original design that fights against the [[Iron Giant]] and the [[RX-78-2 Gundam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/ranking-ready-player-one-easter-eggs-by-cleverness|title=The most (and least) clever Ready Player One Easter eggs and nostalgia references|first=Preston|last=Burt|work=Syfy|date=March 30, 2018|accessdate=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the game ''[[Bulletstorm]]'' there's a level where the player controls a mechanical version of a Hekaton (which is the game's equivalent to Godzilla) as well as the song being played during this part of the game being called "Mecha-dzilla"

Godzilla and Mechagodzilla make a cameo appearance in ''[[Ugly Americans (TV series)|Ugly Americans]]'' (Season 1: Episode 7 ''Kong of Queens'') in which King Kong fights Godzilla (King Kong's children watching the movie ''Godzilla vs. King Kong'') and another when Kong punches a wall (after an argument with Mark Lily on the phone), the Showa-era Mechagodzilla was seen having breakfast.

Mechagodzilla was parodied by the series ''[[South Park]]'' in their episode "[[Mecha-Streisand]]", which features singer [[Barbara Streisand]] becoming a gigantic mechanical monster. The episode also includes references to [[Mothra]], [[Gamera]], and [[Ultraman (character)|Ultraman]].

The Shōwa Mechagodzilla appears in the video games ''[[Godzilla: Monster of Monsters]]'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], ''[[Godzilla (Game Boy)|Godzilla]]'' for the [[Game Boy]], ''[[Super Godzilla]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] (American release; replaces the Heisei version from the Super Famicom release, since the Heisei incarnation's film had yet to be released in America when the game was released), ''[[Godzilla: Battle Legends]]'' for [[TurboGrafx-16]], ''[[Godzilla Generations]]'' for the [[Dreamcast]] (erroneously using his Heisei counterpart's sound effects) and ''[[Godzilla Generations: Maximum Impact]]'' for the Dreamcast and the [[Wii]] version of ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]''.

The Heisei Mechagodzilla appeared in the video games ''[[Super Godzilla]]'' (Japanese version, replaced by the Showa Mechagodzilla in the English release) and ''[[Godzilla: Monster War]]'', both for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], ''[[Godzilla: Domination|Godzilla: Domination!]]'' for [[Game Boy Advance]], ''[[Godzilla: Save the Earth]]'' for [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[PlayStation 2]], ''[[Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee]]'' for Xbox and the [[Nintendo GameCube]], and the [[Wii]] and [[PlayStation 2]] versions of ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]''.

Kiryu first appeared in the Japanese version of ''[[Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee]]'' on the [[Nintendo GameCube]]. Since the Millennium Mechagodzilla duology would take a few years to reach US stores, it was dropped from the American version of the game but did appear as an exclusive in the Xbox version. Kiryu was next playable in ''[[Godzilla: Save the Earth]]'' for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and the [[PlayStation 2]] under the title "Mechagodzilla 3"; this would be Kiryu's first PS2 appearance in the United States. Kiryu also appears in both versions of ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]'', for the first time under the name "Kiryu" as opposed to its names in the two previous games; "Millennium Mechagodzilla" and "Mechagodzilla 3".

Like the other kaiju in the game, the backstories of all three Mechagodzilla incarnations are altered slightly, to fit the context of the game. The Heisei Mechagodzilla and Kiryu are man-made mecha created by the G.D.F. (Global Defense Force) faction to defend Earth from the Vortaak and their kaiju of the Aliens faction. The original Showa Mechagodzilla was salvaged and rebuilt by the Vortaak to be used in their kaiju force.

In the PlayStation 4 version of ''[[Godzilla (2014 video game)|Godzilla]]'', 4 incarnations of Mechagodzilla appear, the original Showa Mechagodzilla appears as both Mechagodzilla from ''Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla'' and as Mechagodzilla 2 the rebuilt Mechagodzilla from ''Terror of Mechagodzilla''. The Heisei Mechagodzilla appears in its Super Mechagodzilla form, while Kiryu appears in its rebuilt design from ''Tokyo S.O.S.''

In the PS4 version, all 4 Mechagodzilla are playable, the 2 versions of the Showa Mechagodzilla can be played in God of Destruction Mode via the Invade option (which allows the mode to be played using Kaiju other than the Heisei era Godzilla), while Super Mechagodzilla and Kiryu can be played via selecting Defend option (where the player defends humanity as friendly kaiju such as Mothra and various G-Force Mecha). In the PS3 version, only Mechagodzilla 1975, Super Mechagodzilla, and Kiryu appear as bosses and are not playable.

The thirteenth level of ''[[City Shrouded in Shadow]]'', a game where players, as civilians, must escape and survive kaiju attacks, mostly mirrors the first encounter between Godzilla and Kiryu in [[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]. The protagonists, tied up in the building by Yakuza thugs, witness [[Godzilla]] rampage through the game's setting, the fictional Ichi City, and Kiryu is eventually deployed in response. After a short battle where both shoot at each other, Godzilla roars at Kiryu, and reminds the spirit within of [[Godzilla (1954 film)|his past]] as a Godzilla, causing him to be possessed &amp; go berserk. As Godzilla leaves, Kiryu approaches and fires missiles at the building in which the player is in. Once the player has reached safety or once 30 seconds have transpired, Kiryu marches through the building, cleaving it in half, heading off into the distance. The newspaper that displays the results after the level reveals that, after 30 minutes of rampaging, Kiryu has run out of power, allowing the government to retrieve the inactive mecha.

While Mechagodzilla did not appear in ''[[Godzilla: The Series]]'', a sequel to ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1998), the first Godzilla was reanimated as a cyborg called ''Cyber-Godzilla'' in the Monster Wars trilogy.&lt;ref name="Ultimate Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2006/03/28/godzilla-the-series/|title=The Ultimate Guide to Godzilla: The Series|last1=Johnson|first1=Bob|last2=Aiken|first2=Keith|work=SciFi Japan|date=March 28, 2006|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon is defined as the [[Western media]]'s undue focus on upper-middle-class white women who disappear, with the disproportionate degree of coverage they receive being compared to cases of missing [[women of color]] and missing men and women of lower [[social class]]es.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite news|title=(White) Women We Love|date=June 10, 2005|first=Eugene |last=Robinson|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/09/AR2005060901729.html |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Armstrong2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cory L.

Instances have been cited in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and South Africa.&lt;ref name=SABC3&gt;{{cite web|title=Oscar Pistorius: The Verdict|url=http://www.sabc3.co.za/sabc/home/sabc3/news/details?id=14721d18-cc3f-42ff-bb32-aea285edbe09&amp;title=Special%20Assignment|accessdate=October 21, 2014|publisher=SABC|date= September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PBS]] news anchor [[Gwen Ifill]] is said to be the originator of the phrase.&lt;ref name="Armstrong2013"/&gt;  [[Charlton McIlwain]], a professor at [[New York University]], defines the syndrome as white women perpetually occupying a privileged role as violent crime victims in news media reporting, and concludes that missing white woman syndrome functions as a type of [[racial hierarchy]] in the cultural imagery of the West.&lt;ref name=NYU&gt;{{cite news |date=May 9, 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22441124 |title=Cleveland abductions: Do white victims get more attention? |work=BBC |quote=Charlton McIlwain, professor New York University: White women occupy a privileged role as violent crime victims in news media reporting. |accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Eduardo Bonilla-Silva categorizes the racial component of missing white woman syndrome as a form of racial grammar, through which [[white supremacy]] is normalized by implicit or even invisible standards.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt;

Missing white woman syndrome has led to a number of [[Right-wing populism|right-wing]] [[Law and order (politics)|tough on crime]] measures that were named for white women who disappeared and were subsequently found harmed.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Land Stein, University of Southern Mississippi (2012) THE CULTURAL COMPLEX OF INNOCENCE: AN EXAMINATION OF MEDIA AND SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF MISSING WHITE WOMAN SYNDROME http://aquila.usm.edu/dissertations/858/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laurie Essig Ph.D.|date=2014|title=Racial Politics in the US and the Figure of the White Lady.

Also noteworthy was that news coverage of missing black women was more likely to focus on the victim's baggage, such as abusive boyfriends or a troubled past, while coverage of white women tends to focus on their roles as mothers or daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cheryl L.

==Media coverage==
===United States===
With regard to missing children, statistical research which compares national media reports with [[FBI]] data shows that there is marked under-representation of [[African American]] children in media reports&lt;!--of all kinds, or of crimes only?--&gt; relative to non-African American children. A subsequent study found that girls from [[minority group]]s were the most under-represented in these missing-children news reports by a very large margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Min|first=Seong-Jae|author2=John C Feaster|title=Missing Children in National News Coverage: Racial and Gender Representations of Missing Children Cases|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=July–September 2010|volume=27|issue=3|pages=201–216|url=https://www.academia.edu/857391/Missing_Children_in_National_News_Coverage_Racial_and_Gender_Representations_of_Missing_Children_Cases|accessdate=May 9, 2013|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zach Sommers, a [[Sociology|sociologist]] at [[Northwestern University]], noted that while there is a sizable body of research that shows that white people are more likely than people of color to appear in news coverage as victims of violent crime there is relatively little when it comes to missing persons cases.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt; In 2013, Sommers cross-referenced the missing persons coverage of four national and local media outlets against the FBI's missing persons database. Sommers found black people received disproportionately less coverage than whites and men received disproportionately less coverage than women; Sommers could not directly assess the number of missing white women in the FBI files due to how the data was structured but concluded that there was circumstantial—although not statistically conclusive—evidence that white women received disproportionate coverage.&lt;ref name="Demby"&gt;{{cite web |first=Gene |last=Demby |title=What We Know (And Don't Know) About 'Missing White Women Syndrome' |date=April 13, 2017 |publisher=[[NPR]] |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/13/523769303/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-missing-white-women-syndrome |accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt; In the same study, professor Eduardo Bonilla-Silva elucidated that the subtle standard of placing a premium on white lives in the news helps to maintain and reinforce a [[racial hierarchy]] with whites at the top. For example, [[black women]] are members of both a marginalized racial group and a marginalized gender group.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt; Crucially, though, black women have an “intersectional experience [that] is greater than the sum of [[racism]] and sexism.” In other words, like white women, black women are subject to sexism, but the form of that sexism differs for black women because of the compounding effects of [[racial discrimination]]; with missing white woman syndrome being a pertinent manifestation of this social phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Demby"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt; Sociologists note that the tone of media coverage for black female victims differs markedly from coverage of white female victims in that the former are more likely to be blamed for purportedly putting themselves in harm's way, either knowingly or unknowingly. [[Victim blaming]] in this context reinforces the notion that black female victims are not only less innocent, but also less worthy of rescue relative to white women.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt; Other observers note the lack of publicity given to black female victims of [[police brutality]] in news coverage, attributing the silence to a tradition of “sexism and [[patriarchy]]” in American society.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt;

A report that aired on [[CNN]] noted the differences between the level of media coverage given to Caucasian women like [[Murder of Laci Peterson|Laci Peterson]] and [[Natalee Holloway]], who disappeared in 2002 and 2005 respectively, and [[Murder of LaToyia Figueroa|LaToyia Figueroa]], a pregnant Black Hispanic woman. Figueroa disappeared in Philadelphia the same year Holloway disappeared. Figueroa and her unborn daughter were found murdered.&lt;ref name=coverage&gt;{{cite news |date=March 17, 2006 |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0603/17/sbt.01.html |title=Race Bias in Media Coverage of Missing Women?; Cheryl Hines Dishes on New Show |work=CNN.com |quote=TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Natalee Holloway, Lori Hacking, Taylor Biehl, the list goes on and on.

PARKS: Like everybody else, I call it the missing white woman syndrome. |accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The San Francisco Chronicle published an article detailing the disparity between the coverage of the Peterson case and that of Evelyn Hernandez, a Hispanic woman who was nine months pregnant when she disappeared in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/04/21/MN275651.DTL |title=Eerily similar case languishes in obscurity; Torso of missing pregnant mom was found in S.F. Bay last year |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=April 21, 2003 |accessdate=November 24, 2010 |first=Kelly |last=St. John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kym Pasqualini, president of the [[National Center for Missing Adults]], observed that media outlets tend to focus on "[[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]" – typically, affluent young white women and teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/forensics/americas_missing/3.html |title=Damsels in Distress |first=David |last=Krajicek |page=3 |work=[[TruTV|TruTV.com]] |accessdate=July 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728062922/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/forensics/americas_missing/3.html |archive-date=July 28, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2016 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' article about the [[disappearance of Tiffany Whitton]], journalist [[Tom Junod]] observed that women of lower social status such as Whitton, a 26-year-old unemployed drug addict who was on parole, do not get much media attention as "media outlets are ruthlessly selective, and they tend to prefer women who are white, pretty, and, above all, innocent". Whitton's mother stated that producers of shows like ''[[Nancy Grace (TV series)|Nancy Grace]]'' told her they weren't interested in her daughter's case.&lt;ref name="Tiffany Whitton"&gt;{{cite news|last=Junod|first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Junod|title=Missing: The Curious Anomaly of Tiffany Whitton's Disappearance|url=https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a44402/missing-tom-junod/|newspaper=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=April 29, 2016|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Cory L. Armstrong wrote in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that "the pattern of choosing only young, white, middle-class women for the full damsel treatment says a lot about a nation that likes to believe it has consigned [[Race (human classification)|race]] and [[Social class|class]] to irrelevance".&lt;ref name="Armstrong2013"/&gt; 

===Canada===
According to a study published in ''The Law and Society Association'', [[First Nations|aboriginal]] women who go missing in Canada receive 27 times less news coverage than white women; they also receive "dispassionate and less-detailed, headlines, articles, and images."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gilchrist |first=Kristen |title=Invisible Victims: Disparity in Print-News Media Coverage of Missing/Murdered Aboriginal and White Women |url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/9/1/4/p239140_index.html |work=AllAcademic.com |date=May 27, 2008 |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
University of Leicester Criminology Professor Yvonne Jewkes cites the [[murder of Milly Dowler]], the [[murder of Sarah Payne]], and the [[Soham murders]] as examples of "eminently newsworthy stories" about girls from "respectable" middle-class families and backgrounds whose parents used the news media effectively.&lt;ref name=Jewkes&gt;{{cite book|title=Media and Crime|author=Yvonne Jewkes|pages=52–53|year=2004|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=0-7619-4765-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She writes that, in contrast, the street [[murder of Damilola Taylor]], a 10-year- old boy from Nigeria, initially received little news coverage, with reports initially concentrating upon street crime levels and community policing, and largely ignoring the victim. Even when Damilola's father flew into the UK from Nigeria to make press statements and television appearances, the level of public outcry did not, Jewkes asserts, reach "the near hysterical outpourings of anger and sadness that accompanied the deaths of Sarah, [[Murder of Milly Dowler|Milly]], Holly, and Jessica".&lt;ref name=Jewkes /&gt;

In January 2006, London Police Commissioner [[Ian Blair]] described the media as [[institutional racism|institutionally racist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4651368.stm |title=Met chief accuses media of racism |publisher=BBC News |date=January 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4654224.stm |title=The story of two murder victims |publisher=BBC News |date=January 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, he had referred to the murder of two young girls in [[Soham]] in 2002. He said "almost nobody" understood why it became such a big story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4653130.stm |title=Blair apologises to Soham parents |publisher=BBC News |date=January 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two cases of missing white girl syndrome that have been given as contrasting examples: the [[murder of Hannah Williams]] and the [[murder of Danielle Jones]]. It was suggested that Jones received more coverage than Williams because Jones was a middle-class schoolgirl, whilst Williams was from a working-class background with a [[nose piercing|stud in her nose]] and estranged parents.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Homicide|author=Fiona Brookman|year=2005|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=0-7619-4755-8|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Sandile Memela, chief director for [[social cohesion]] at [[South Africa]]'s [[Department of Arts and Culture (South Africa)|Department of Arts and Culture]], noted amidst the [[Oscar Pistorius]] [[Trial of Oscar Pistorius|trial]] that there existed substantial differences between how media outlets reported on the murders of [[Reeva Steenkamp]] and [[Zanele Khumalo]]; two South African models, respectively white and black, who had been murdered by their boyfriends under nearly identical circumstances.&lt;ref name="Memela"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/the-trial-next-door-oscar-pistorius-gets-the-headlines-but-what-about-thato-kutumela-9194821.html |title=The trial next door: Oscar Pistorius gets the headlines, but what about Thato Kutumela? |publisher=The Independent |date=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memela asserted that the discrepancy between the media coverage of the Steenkamp and Khumala murders amounted to "[[Institutional racism|structural racism]]" within South African society, and stated: "As a country we seem to have chosen to ignore the agony, pain and suffering of the Khumalo family for no other reason than that they are black."&lt;ref name="Memela"/&gt;

On September 11, 2014, the South African news network SABC3 aired an investigative report which raised concerns around the “Missing White Woman Syndrome”; where the death of Steenkamp was juxtaposed with the death of Zanele Khumalo.&lt;ref name="SABC3"/&gt;

===Other alleged cases of disproportionate media interest===
====Jessica Lynch====
[[File:JessicaLynch02.jpeg|thumb|News coverage of [[Jessica Lynch]]'s rescue]]
Social commentaries pointed to media bias in the coverage of soldier [[Jessica Lynch]] versus that of her fellow soldiers, [[Shoshana Johnson]] and [[Lori Piestewa]]. All three were ambushed in the same attack during the [[Iraq War]] on March 23, 2003, with Piestewa being killed and Lynch and Johnson being injured and taken prisoner. Lynch, a young, blonde, white woman, received far more media coverage than Johnson (a black woman and a single mother) and Piestewa (a [[Hopi]] from an impoverished background, and also a single mother), with media critics suggesting that the media gave more attention to the woman with whom audiences supposedly more readily identify.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news |title= A case of race?

Lynch herself leveled harsh criticism at this disproportionate coverage that focused only on her, stating in a congressional testimony before the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]]:

{{quote|I am still confused as to why they chose to lie and tried to make me a legend when the real heroics of my fellow soldiers that day were, in fact, legendary. People like Lori Piestewa and First Sergeant Dowdy who picked up fellow soldiers in harm's way. Or people like Patrick Miller and Sergeant Donald Walters who actually fought until the very end. The bottom line is the American people are capable of determining their own ideals of heroes and they don't need to be told elaborate tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20070424110022.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220085535/http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20070424110022.pdf

====Presumed kidnapping of "blonde angel" in Greece====
In October 2013, a girl estimated to be about 4 years of age was found in the custody of a [[Romani people|Roma]] couple in Greece and was presumed to have been abducted.  The story about the "blonde angel" and the search for her biological parents received international media coverage.  A Romani rights activist commented on the case to say "imagine if the situation were reversed and the children were brown and the parents were white".&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/19/21036597-tips-pour-in-after-blonde-girl-without-an-identity-found-in-roma-camp-in-greece Tips pour in after blonde girl 'without an identity' found in Roma camp in Greece] ''[[NBC News]]'' October 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Blumberg (October 28, 2013), [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/antonia-blumberg/blumberg_b_4170868.html Why the Roma 'Blond Angel' Ignited a Week of Racial Profiling] ''[[Huffington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Adams (November 8, 2013), [https://archive.is/20140406192217/http://www.collegiatetimes.com/opinion/article_a879ba26-6391-11e3-99d9-001a4bcf6878.html Abduction case reveals bias on basis of race] ''[[Collegiate Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/world/europe/for-the-roma-fears-of-kidnapping-in-europe-only-mirror-their-own.html For the Roma, Fears of kidnapping in Europe Only Mirror Their Own] ''[[The New York Times]]'' October 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The child was later identified as Maria Ruseva.

====Murder trial defendants====
Critics have also cited excessive media coverage of murder trials where the defendant is female, white, young and attractive, and included them along with Missing White Woman Syndrome instances in an all-encompassing narrative nicknamed the "woman in jeopardy" or "damsel in distress" genre.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farhi"&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Farhi |title=Bad girls and gone girls: Why the media tired of ‘missing white women’ |date=December 13, 2015 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/bad-girls-and-gone-girls-why-the-media-tired-of-missing-white-women/2015/12/09/5660fb52-9934-11e5-94f0-9eeaff906ef3_story.html |accessdate=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, the media will focus on the accused, rather than the victim as in Missing White Woman Syndrome cases, and they will be more ambiguous about their guilt than in other criminal cases regardless of evidence. Cited examples include [[Amanda Knox]], [[Jodi Arias]] and [[Casey Anthony]].

==Cited instances==
&lt;!-- THIS IS NOT A LIST OF MISSING PERSONS. ONLY ADD CASES THAT HAVE BEEN LINKED TO MWWS IN RELIABLE SOURCES --&gt;
The following missing person cases have been cited as instances of missing white woman syndrome; media commentators on the phenomenon regard them as garnering a disproportionate level of media coverage relative to contemporary cases involving missing girls or women of non-white ethnicities, and missing males of all ethnicities.

Mumtaz Mahal was born Arjumand Banu Begum in [[Agra]] to a family of [[Persia]]n [[nobility]].

Mumtaz Mahal died in 1631 in [[Burhanpur]], [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] (present-day [[Madhya Pradesh]]), during the birth of her fourteenth child, a daughter named [[Gauhar Ara Begum]].&lt;ref name="Kumar2014" /&gt; Shah Jahan had the Taj Mahal built as a tomb for her, which is considered to be a monument of "undying love". 

==Family and early life==
Mumtaz Mahal (Original Name: Arjumand Banu Begum) was born on 27 April 1593&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Mullah Muhammad Saleh Kamboh: Shah Jahan-Nama, Lahore, 2013, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; in Agra to Abu'l-Hasan Asaf Khan{{sfn|Tillotson|2012|p=20}} and his wife Diwanji Begum, the daughter of a Persian noble, Khwaja Ghias-ud-din of [[Qazvin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmad|first1=Moin-ud-din|title=The Taj and Its Environments: With 8 Illus. from Photos., 1 Map, and 4 Plans|date=1924|publisher=R. G. Bansal|page=101|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asaf Khan was a wealthy Persian noble who held high office in the Mughal Empire. His family had come to [[India]] impoverished in 1577, when his father [[Mirza Ghias Beg]] (popularly known by his title of I'timad-ud-Daulah),{{sfn|Tillotson|2012|p=194}} was taken into the service of Emperor [[Akbar]] in Agra.&lt;ref name="Thackeray"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thackeray|first1=Frank W.|last2=editors|first2=John E.

Asaf Khan was also the older brother of Empress [[Nur Jahan]], making Mumtaz a niece, and later, a step daughter-in-law of Nur Jahan, the chief consort of Emperor [[Jahangir]], Shah Jahan's father.&lt;ref name="persian.packhum.org"&gt;[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D00702015%26ct%3D304%26rqs%3D181 Abu Fazl 'Allami, ''Áín i Akbarí'']&lt;/ref&gt; Her older sister, Parwar Khanum, married Sheikh Farid, the son of Nawab [[Qutubuddin Koka]], the governor of [[Badaun]], who was also the emperor Jahangir's foster brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Waqf board handles Muslim rulers' property |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Waqf-board-handles-Muslim-rulers-property-/articleshow/6668877.cms | newspaper=The Times Of India |date= 2 October 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mumtaz also had a brother, [[Shaista Khan]], who served as the governor of various provinces in the empire during Shah Jahan's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ball|first1=Valentine|title=Tavernier's travels in India between years 1640-1676 : being a narrative of the six voyages of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier to the east - especially to India, translated from the original French edition of 1676, with a biographical sketch of the author, notes, appendices, &amp; c.|date=2007|publisher=Asian Educational Services|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788120615670|page=245|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
[[File:Mumtaz Mahal with attendant.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Mumtaz Mahal with an attendant.]]
Mumtaz Mahal was betrothed to Shah Jahan around 30 January 1607,{{sfn|Findly|1993|p=39}} when she was 14 years old at the time and he was 15. They were, however, married five years after the year of their betrothal on 30 April 1612 in Agra.{{sfn|Findly|1993|p=39}} The marriage was a real love-match.{{sfn|Findly|1993|p=164}} After their wedding celebrations, Shah Jahan, "finding her in appearance and character elect among all the women of the time", gave her the title "Mumtaz Mahal" Begum ("the Exalted One of the Palace").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pant|first1=Chandra|title=Nur Jahan and Her Family|date=1978|publisher=Dandewal Publishing House|page=112|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="K18"&gt;Koch, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; During the intervening years between their betrothal and marriage, Shah Jahan had gotten married to his first wife, Princess [[Kandahari Begum]] in 1609 and in 1617, after marrying Mumtaz, took a third wife, [[Izz-un-Nissa Begum]] (titled Akbarabadi Mahal),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarker|first1=Kobita|title=Shah Jahan and his paradise on earth : the story of Shah Jahan's creations in Agra and Shahjahanabad in the golden days of the Mughals|date=2007|publisher=K.P.

By all accounts, Shah Jahan was so taken with Mumtaz that he showed little interest in exercising his [[polygamous]] rights with his two other wives, other than dutifully siring a child with each.&lt;ref name=Koch2006&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koch|first1=Ebba|title=The complete Taj Mahal and the riverfront gardens of Agra|date=2006|publisher=Bookwise (India) Pvt. Ltd.|page=18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official court chronicler, Motamid Khan, as recorded in his ''Iqbal Namah-e-Jahangiri'', the relationship with his other wives "had nothing more than the status of marriage. The intimacy, deep affection, attention and favour which Shah Jahan had for Mumtaz exceeded what he felt for his other wives."&lt;ref name="K18"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qazwini. fol. 233a translated by Begley and Desai (1984), page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Shah Jahan's historian Inayat Khan commented that 'his whole delight was centered on this illustrious lady [Mumtaz], to such an extent that he did not feel towards the others [i.e. his other wives] one-thousandth part of the affection that he did for her.'{{sfn|Tillotson|2012|p=30}}

Mumtaz had a loving marriage with Shah Jahan. Even during her lifetime, poets would extol her beauty, grace, and compassion. Despite her frequent pregnancies, Mumtaz travelled with Shah Jahan's entourage throughout his earlier military campaigns and the subsequent rebellion against his father. She was his constant companion and trusted confidant, leading court historians to go to unheard lengths to document the intimate and erotic relationship the couple enjoyed. In their nineteen years of marriage, they had fourteen children together (eight sons and six daughters),{{sfn|Tillotson|2012|p=30}} seven of whom died at birth or at a very young age.&lt;ref name="Kumar2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kumar |first=Anant |date=January–June 2014 |title=Monument of Love or Symbol of Maternal Death: The Story Behind the Taj Mahal |url=http://www.casereportswomenshealth.com/article/S2214-9112(14)00003-4/pdf |journal=Case Reports in Women's Health |publisher=Elsevier |volume=1 |issue= |pages=4–7 |doi=10.1016/j.crwh.2014.07.001 |access-date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ltd|isbn=9788120710153|page=425|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mumtaz's tenure as empress was brief (spanning a period of only three years due to her untimely death), nonetheless Shah Jahan bestowed her with luxuries that no other empress was given before her. For example, no other empress' residence was as decorated as Khas Mahal (part of [[Agra Fort]]), where Mumtaz lived with Shah Jahan. It was decorated with pure gold and precious stones and had rose water fountains of its own. Each wife of the Mughal emperor was given a regular monthly allowance for her ''gastos'' (housekeeping or travelling expenses). The highest allowance on record is the 10 [[lakh]] [[rupees]] per year given to Mumtaz Mahal by Shah Jahan.{{sfn|Findly|1993|p=320}}

Shah Jahan consulted Mumtaz in both private matters and the affairs of the state, and she served as his close confidant and trusted adviser.

A noted [[Sanskrit]] poet, Vansidhara Mishra, was the Empress' favourite.&lt;ref name="Nath1990" /&gt; On the recommendation of her principal lady-in-waiting, Sati-un-Nissa, Mumtaz Mahal provided pensions and donations to the daughters of poor scholars, theologians, and pious men.&lt;ref name=Wade98&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wade|first1=Bonnie C.|title=Imaging sound : an ethnomusicological study of music, art, and culture in Mughal India|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226868400|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was quite common for women of noble birth to commission architecture in the Mughal Empire, so Mumtaz devoted some time to a riverside garden in Agra, which is now known as Zahara Bagh.

[[File:Interior4.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Mumtaz Mahal in the [[Taj Mahal]], alongside her husband Shah Jahan.]]
The [[Taj Mahal]] was commissioned by Shah Jahan to be built as a mausoleum for Mumtaz Mahal. It is seen as an embodiment of undying love and marital devotion. English poet [[Edwin Arnold|Sir Edwin Arnold]] describes it as "Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passion of an emperor's love wrought in living stones." The beauty of the monument is also taken as a representation of Mumtaz Mahal's beauty and this association leads many to describe the Taj Mahal as feminine.{{sfn|Tillotson|2012|p=4}} Since Muslim tradition forbids elaborate decorations on graves, the bodies of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan are placed in a relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned to the right and towards [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Greatest Wonders of the World|last=Khatri|first=Vikas|publisher=V S Publishers|year=2012|isbn=9381588309|location=|pages=128|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Names of God in Islam|The Ninety Nine Names of God]] are found as calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the  tomb of Mumtaz Mahal in the crypt including, “O Noble, O Magnificent, O Majestic, O Unique, O Eternal, O Glorious…".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tajmahal.org.uk/calligraphy.html|title=Taj Mahal Calligraphy|last=|first=|date=|website=Taj Mahal|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many theories about the origin of the name of this tomb and one of them suggests that 'Taj' is an abbreviation of the name Mumtaz. European travelers, such as [[François Bernier]], who observed its construction, were among the first to call it the Taj Mahal. Since it is unlikely that they came up with the name, it is suggested that they might have picked it up from the locals of Agra who called the Empress 'Taj Mahal' and thought the tomb was named after her and the name began to be used interchangeably. However, there is no firm evidence to suggest this. Shah Jahan had not intended to entomb another person in the Taj Mahal;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ruggles |first1=D. Fairchild |authorlink=D.

'''Brenda Marie Gerow''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|ɜr|oʊ}}) (February 18, 1960–ca. April 6, 1981), previously known as '''Pima County Jane Doe''', was a formerly unidentified [[Americans|American]] murder victim who was found on April 8, 1981. In late 2014, a photograph of a facial reconstruction of the victim was made public that led to Gerow's identification the next year.&lt;ref name=tech/&gt; She was buried under a headstone with the placeholder name of "Jane Doe" with the phrase "UNK - 1981"&lt;ref name=here/&gt; Gerow's body remained unidentified for thirty-four years until it was announced that her remains had positively been identified.&lt;ref name=union/&gt;&lt;ref name=victim&gt;{{cite news|title=Victim in 34-year-old AZ cold case identified as Nashua woman|url=http://www.wmur.com/news/victim-in-34yearold-az-cold-case-identified-as-nashua-woman/35567366|accessdate=30 September 2015|work=WMUR 9 ABC|agency=ABC|date=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=update&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hockridge|first1=Stephanie|title=Brenda Gerow update: 'Jane Doe' identified after 34 years of mystery|url=http://www.abc15.com/news/region-central-southern-az/other/brenda-gerow-update-jane-doe-identified-after-34-years-of-mystery|accessdate=30 September 2015|work=ABC 15|publisher=ABC|date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=person&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murrillo|first1=Lupita|title=Crime Trackers: Jane Doe from 1981 identified, person of interest named|url=http://www.kvoa.com/story/30136315/crime-trackers-jane-doe-from-1981-identified-person-of-interest-named|accessdate=30 September 2015|work=KVOA News Tucson|date=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=identified&gt;{{cite news|title=New Hampshire Woman Identified As Arizona Cold Case Victim|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/09/30/brenda-gerow-jane-doe-new-hampshire/|accessdate=30 September 2015|work=CBS Boston|publisher=CBS|date=30 September 2015|location=Boston, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance and murder==
Gerow, the oldest of her siblings, disappeared in July 1980 after leaving with John "Jack" Kalhauser, her boyfriend at the time. She had worked at a convenience store as well as a bartender at an establishment in Dracut, Massachusetts, often frequented by bikers. She remained in contact with family and had at one time called home stating she would be returning, yet she never did. Her family attempted to report her missing, yet local police declined to cooperate, due to the fact that she was an adult when she vanished.&lt;ref name="girl" /&gt;

The body of a white female was found in the desert on April 8, 1981 in [[Tucson]], [[Pima County]], [[Arizona]], near Houghton Road and [[Interstate 10]].&lt;ref name=namus/&gt; Her remains were found by hunters driving in the desert who saw a jacket hanging from a tree and then looked through the area and discovered her body lying on the ground.&lt;ref name=here&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kimble|first1=Mark|title=Jane Doe: 21 years here in a grave marked UNK|url=http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/2002/04/11/45671-kimble-column/|accessdate=21 January 2015|work=Tucson Citizen|date=11 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sheriff/&gt;

The victim was a young adult, between eighteen and twenty-two years of age.&lt;ref name=ncmec/&gt; The autopsy determined she died one-and-a-half to two days before her body was discovered and cause of death was strangulation by [[Strangling#Ligature strangulation|ligature]].  She had been severely beaten in addition to being sexually assaulted.&lt;ref name=tech/&gt;&lt;ref name=here/&gt;&lt;ref name=sheriff/&gt;&lt;ref name=network/&gt;  When found, her body was in an advanced state of decomposition rendering her facially unrecognizable and her eye color undetermined. The pathologist who examined her was able to determine she had a light skin complexion as well as long, light brown to blond hair. The victim also had a noticeable white spot on one of her upper front teeth.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pima Arizona Jane Doe April 1981|url=http://canyouidentifyme.org/PimaArizonaJaneDoeApril1981|website=canyouidentifyme.org|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was approximately five feet two to five feet three inches and weighed around 100 to 110 pounds at the time of her death.&lt;ref name=here/&gt;&lt;ref name=ncmec&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1981|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1204413/1#poster|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]]|accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional evidence at the scene may have been blown away due to winds.&lt;ref name="girl" /&gt;

Her body was clothed in denim jeans, white socks with pink [[pom poms]], a white bra, blue underwear, brown suede shoes and unique blouse that was a dark blue and had "puffy reddish-colored sleeves" with a flower design.&lt;ref name=namus&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 10566|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/10566|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=December 22, 2014|date=August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A denim jacket was found hanging in brush near the body.&lt;ref name=sheriff&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe #3|url=http://www.pimasheriff.org/prevention/cold-case1/?ref_cID=2578&amp;bID=8174&amp;dd_asId=61630|publisher=Pima County Sheriff Department|accessdate=21 January 2015|date=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The crime scene was photographed and law enforcement flew over the area to take further photographs and to find any additional clues.&lt;ref name=here/&gt; Body decomposition was not advanced enough to completely alter her fingerprints, which were eventually taken. Dental information was obtained along with, years later, her DNA.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt; A DNA profile from another individual was extracted from her clothing in 2006, which allowed for a DNA profile of a potential suspect to be created after the sample analysis was completed in 2007.&lt;ref name=tech&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murillo|first1=Lupita|title=New technology helping in '81 cold case|url=http://www.kvoa.com/news/new-technology-helping-in-81-cold-case/|accessdate=21 January 2015|work=KVOA News|agency=NBC|date=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the victim was found, authorities in Tucson were unable to obtain fingerprints.  In an effort to obtain her fingerprints, the victim's hands were removed from the body and sent to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].  While the FBI had been successful in getting fingerprints from the victim, they were not a match to any missing persons on file or to anyone arrested for a crime.  The case was compared to several missing person cases but all were ruled out.&lt;ref name=here/&gt;&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;

To investigators, the style of some of her clothing suggested she could have been involved in the local county fair that had occurred at the time of her murder.&lt;ref name=here/&gt;&lt;ref name=network/&gt; Images of the victim's clothing have been featured on websites, National Center for Missing and Exploited Children posters, and in various news reports, in an effort to identify her.&lt;ref name=seek&gt;{{cite news|last1=Melanson|first1=Alana|title=Police seek woman's ID in cold-case probe|url=http://www.lowellsun.com/todaysheadlines/ci_27082792/police-seek-womans-id-cold-case-probe|accessdate=21 January 2015|work=Lowell Sun|date=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim had been walking or running through a wooded area before her death, as scratches on her body suggested.&lt;ref name=here/&gt;&lt;ref name=network&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 1058UFAZ|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/1058ufaz.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=December 22, 2014|date=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "crude" sketch was created of the victim at the time initially following her discovery. It was released to the public on television and in the newspapers, yet the victim was not recognized by anyone in the area.&lt;ref name="girl" /&gt; After a 2012 exhumation of the body, the victim's face was digitally [[forensic facial reconstruction|reconstructed]] after her skull was examined via a [[Computerized tomography|CT scan]].  The scan was sponsored by the [[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] in order to create an approximation of facial features and appearance when the victim was alive.&lt;ref name=after&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matas|first1=Kimberly|title=Cold Case: 32 years after her death, deputies seek to ID Jane Doe|url=http://tucson.com/news/local/crime/cold-case-years-after-her-death-deputies-seek-to-id/article_5ef2f400-2424-59d0-80bd-2b468689c555.html|accessdate=21 January 2015|work=Arizona Daily Star|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sasha&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Sasha|title=Arizona sheriff hopes DNA, facial reconstruction, will help crack 32-year-old cold case|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/arizona-sheriff-reopens-32-year-old-cold-case-article-1.1383809|accessdate=21 January 2015|work=New York Daily News|date=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different theories regarding the life and demise of the victim existed. Investigators theorized she was a runaway as a child before she became an adult, had possibly been estranged from family, had been murdered elsewhere and [[dump job|dumped]] at a new scene, or had hitchhiked to Tucson from another location.&lt;ref name=here/&gt;&lt;ref name=network/&gt; Early into the investigation, it was theorized she could have been a victim of the then-unidentified [[Golden State Killer]], who had moved south since his criminal career began in the mid 1970s.&lt;ref name="girl" /&gt;

===Later efforts and identification===
In 1995, while "building a case" against Kalhauser for assault charges, a photograph of a young woman with light hair holding a bouquet was found in his possession.&lt;ref name=newser2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=cracked&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Keaton|title=34-year-old cold case cracked, Pima County Jane Doe identified|url=http://www.scrippsmedia.com/kgun9/news/34-year-old-cold-case-cracked-Pima-county-Jane-Doe-identified-330493511.html|accessdate=4 October 2015|work=KGun9 News|agency=ABC|date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2014, police announced that they believed the photograph was connected to the case of Pima County Jane Doe and quickly released it to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Machelor|first1=Patty|title=Kalhauser makes deal for 20-year Sentence|url=http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/1999/05/11/70909-kalhauser-makes-deal-for-20-year-sentence/|accessdate=21 June 2015|work=Tucsan Citizen|date=11 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CBSboston/&gt; The woman in the photo was stated to resemble the victim's reconstruction and her physical description.

The then-unidentified woman's photograph was circulated to the public in late 2014 after authorities made the connection between it and the reconstruction.&lt;ref name=newser1 /&gt; Authorities noted that the background scenery appeared to be from somewhere in the Eastern part of the country, most notably at a former camping area in Tyngsboro, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=newser2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lowell /&gt; On December 23, 2014, her brother, Bill Gerow, Jr, received a notification from police that the female in the picture could be his sister.&lt;ref name=speaks /&gt; Gerow hadn't been seen since 1980 after she left the state voluntarily with Kalhauser, with whom she was in a relationship at the approximate age of 20 years.&lt;ref name=cracked/&gt; She had reportedly met her accused killer while at a nightclub.&lt;ref name=newser1 /&gt; She had never explained the reason for her departure, although her family did believe she had "run off."&lt;ref name="newser2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newser.com/article/cb1c3519eec74b3f85d1f8ef126d6a2e/new-hampshire-woman-identified-as-slaying-victim-found-in-1981-father-says-hes-blown-over.html | title=New Hampshire woman identified as slaying victim found in 1981; father says he's 'blown over' | work=Newser | date=30 September 2015 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=November 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother stated that she had called him around two to three weeks afterwards while residing in New Mexico.

The case received national attention among the [[Satanic ritual abuse#As moral panic|Satanic panic]] phenomenon of the 1980s, and was profiled in national media as well as on ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]''.

==Background==
Sally and Shane were both teenagers from [[San Angelo, Texas]], who began dating in 1987 while in high school.&lt;ref name=um/&gt; After a prolonged breakup, they reunited on the evening of July 4, 1988, and made plans to watch the annual firework show at [[Lake Nasworthy]]. During their relationship, Sally's friends had witnessed her attending parties with [[occult]] activities and where [[black magic]] was being practiced; they alleged that she and Shane had been involved with a [[Satanism|Satanic cult]].&lt;ref name=um/&gt; In March 1988, Sally and Shane turned a gun over to local police, claiming that they had been given it by a member of the cult and told it had been used in a murder-robbery.&lt;ref name=um/&gt; Police searched its serial number, and discovered it had been reported stolen.&lt;ref name=um/&gt;

On the evening of July 4, 1988, Sally and Shane were seen alone on the shore of Lake Nasworthy before midnight by a fisherman offshore.&lt;ref name=mcdaniel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanangelolive.com/news/county/2014-07-02/sheriffs-office-announces-developments-26-year-old-double-homicide|work=San Angelo Live|title=Sheriff's Office Announces Developments in 26-Year-Old Double Homicide|date=July 2, 2014|accessdate=January 9, 2017|author=McDaniel, Matt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113093048/http://sanangelolive.com/news/county/2014-07-02/sheriffs-office-announces-developments-26-year-old-double-homicide|archive-date=January 13, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 7, they both were reported as missing persons.&lt;ref name=mcdaniel/&gt;

==Discovery of bodies==
On November 11, 1988, Sally's remains were found off [[List of Farm to Market Roads in Texas (500–599)#RM584|FM 584]], roughly {{convert|4|mi|km}} south of where they were last seen, near the [[Twin Buttes Reservoir]]'s South Pool.&lt;ref name=mcdaniel/&gt; Three days later, on November 14, Shane's remains were discovered in the vicinity. According to their autopsies, they had both died from [[shotgun]] blasts to the head.&lt;ref name=um/&gt; The case remains unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs7.com/content/news/DPS-Needs-Help-in-San-Angelo-Double-Murder-368054151.html|work=CBS7|title=DPS Needs Help in San Angelo Double Murder|date=February 8, 2016|accessdate=December 29, 2016|author=Eady, Kera|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113070047/http://www.cbs7.com/content/news/DPS-Needs-Help-in-San-Angelo-Double-Murder-368054151.html|archive-date=January 13, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2017 developments==
In June 2017 the Tom Green County Sheriff's Office in San Angelo pulled over a local man, John Cyrus Gilbreath, on suspicion of marijuana possession. A female passenger in his car told them Gilbreath was dealing, and on that basis they obtained a [[search warrant|warrant]] to search his house.&lt;ref name=um/&gt;

Among the items they found in the house were what they described as writings, audio tapes and "biological material" that they said may be connected to the McNelly and Stewart homicides. They announced Gilbreath is now considered a [[person of interest]] in that case.&lt;ref name=um/&gt;

'''Neurostimulation''' is the purposeful modulation of the [[nervous system]]'s activity using invasive (e.g. [[microelectrodes]]) or non-invasive means (e.g. [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] or [[transcranial electric stimulation]], tES, such as [[transcranial direct-current stimulation|tDCS]] or [[transcranial alternating current stimulation]], tACS). Neurostimulation usually refers to the electromagnetic approaches to [[Neuromodulation (medicine)|neuromodulation]].

Neurostimulation technology can improve the life quality of those who are severely paralyzed or suffering from profound losses to various sense organs, as well as for permanent reduction of severe, chronic pain which would otherwise require constant (around-the-clock), high-dose opioid therapy (such as neuropathic pain and spinal-cord injury). It serves as the key part of [[neural prosthetics]] for [[hearing aids]], artificial vision, [[artificial limb]]s, and [[brain-machine interfaces]]. In the case of neural [[stimulation]], mostly an electrical stimulation is utilized and charge-balanced biphasic constant current waveforms or capacitively coupled charge injection approaches are adopted. Alternatively, [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] and [[transcranial electric stimulation]] have been proposed as non-invasive methods in which either a [[magnetic field]] or transcranially applied electric currents cause neurostimulation.&lt;ref name=hal&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hallett M |title=Transcranial magnetic stimulation and the human brain |journal=Nature |volume=406 |issue=6792 |pages=147–50 |date=July 2000 |pmid=10910346 |doi=10.1038/35018000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nitsche, Michael A.; Cohen, Leonardo G.; Wassermann, Eric M.; Priori, Alberto; Lang, Nicolas; Antal, Andrea; Paulus, Walter; Hummel, Friedhelm; Boggio, Paulo S.; Fregni, Felipe; Pascual-Leone, Alvaro (2008). "Transcranial direct current stimulation: State of the art 2008". Brain Stimulation 1 (3): 206–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brain stimulation ==
Brain stimulation has potentials to treat some disorders such as [[epilepsy]]. In this method, scheduled stimulation is applied to specific cortical or subcortical targets. There are available commercial devices&lt;ref&gt;Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, U.S.A.&lt;/ref&gt; that can deliver an electrical pulse at scheduled time intervals. Scheduled stimulation is hypothesized to alter the intrinsic neurophysiologic properties of epileptic networks. The most explored targets for scheduled stimulation are the anterior nucleus of the [[thalamus]] and the [[hippocampus]]. The anterior nucleus of the thalamus has been studied, which has shown a significant seizure reduction with the stimulator ''on'' versus ''off'' during several months after stimulator implantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jobst BC, Darcey TM, Thadani VM, Roberts DW |title=Brain stimulation for the treatment of epilepsy |journal=Epilepsia |volume=51 |issue=Suppl 3|pages=88–92 |date=July 2010 |pmid=20618409 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2010.02618.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[cluster headache]] (CH) can be treated by using a temporary stimulating electrode at [[sphenopalatine ganglion]] (SPG). Pain relief is reported within several minutes of stimulation in this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ansarinia M, Rezai A, Tepper SJ, etal |title=Electrical stimulation of sphenopalatine ganglion for acute treatment of cluster headaches |journal=Headache |volume=50 |issue=7 |pages=1164–74 |date=July 2010 |pmid=20438584 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2010.01661.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0017-8748&amp;date=2010&amp;volume=50&amp;issue=7&amp;spage=1164}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid use of implanted electrodes, researchers have engineered ways to inscribe a "window" made of zirconia that has been modified to be transparent and implanted in mice skulls, to allow optical waves to penetrate more deeply, as in [[optogenetics]], to stimulate or inhibit individual neurons.&lt;ref name=Nanomedicine201308&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Damestani |first1= Yasaman |year=2013 |title=Transparent nanocrystalline yttria-stabilized-zirconia calvarium prosthesis |journal=Nanomedicine |volume= 9|issue= 8|pages= 1135–8|publisher=Elsevier Inc. |doi=10.1016/j.nano.2013.08.002 |url=http://www.nanomedjournal.com/article/S1549-9634(13)00361-4/abstract |accessdate=September 11, 2013 |pmid=23969102}}  • Explained by {{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-window-brain-20130903,0,6788242.story |title=A window to the brain?

== Deep brain stimulation ==
[[Deep brain stimulation]] (DBS) has shown benefits for movement disorders such as [[Parkinson's disease]], [[tremor]] and [[dystonia]] and affective disorders such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[Tourette syndrome]], [[chronic pain]] and cluster headache. Since DBS can directly change the brain activity in a controlled manner, it is used to map fundamental mechanisms of brain functions along with neuroimaging methods. A simple DBS system consists of two different parts. First, tiny microelectrodes are implanted in the brain to deliver stimulation pulses to the tissue. Second, an electrical [[pulse generator]] (PG) generates stimulation pulses, which is connected to the electrodes via microwires.
Physiological properties of the brain tissue, which may change with disease state, stimulation parameters, which include amplitude and temporal characteristics, and the geometric configuration of the electrode and the surrounding tissue are all parameters on which DBS of both the normal and the diseased brain depend on. In spite of a huge amount of studies on DBS, its mechanism of action is still not well understood.
Developing DBS microelectrodes is still challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kringelbach ML, Jenkinson N, Owen SL, Aziz TZ |title=Translational principles of deep brain stimulation |journal=Nat. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=623–35 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17637800 |doi=10.1038/nrn2196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-invasive brain stimulation==
[[File:Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a technique for noninvasive stimulation of the adult brain.jpg|thumb|rTMS in a rodent. From Oscar Arias-Carrión, 2008]]
=== Transcranial magnetic stimulation ===
{{Main article|Transcranial magnetic stimulation}}
Compared to electrical stimulation that utilizes brief, high-voltage electric shock to activate neurons, which can potentially activate pain fibers, [[transcranial magnetic stimulation|transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)]] was developed by Baker in 1985. TMS uses a magnetic wire above the [[scalp]], which carries a sharp and high current pulse. A time variant magnetic field is induced perpendicular to the coil due to the applied pulse which consequently generates an electric field based on [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell]]'s law. The electric field provides the necessary current for a non-invasive and much less painful stimulation. There are two TMS devices called single pulse TMS and repetitive pulse TMS (rTMS) while the latter has greater effect but potential to cause seizure. TMS can be used for therapy particularly in [[psychiatry]], as a tool to measure central motor conduction and a research tool to study different aspects of human brain physiology such as motor function, vision, and language. The rTMS method has been used to treat epilepsy with rates of 8–25&amp;nbsp;Hz for 10 seconds. The other therapeutic uses of rTMS include parkinson diseases, dystonia and mood diseases.

== Spinal cord stimulation ==
[[Spinal cord stimulation]] (SCS) is an effective therapy for the treatment of chronic and intractable pain including [[diabetic neuropathy]], [[Failed back syndrome|failed back surgery syndrome]], [[complex regional pain syndrome]], [[phantom limb]] pain, [[Critical limb ischemia|ischemic limb]] pain, refractory unilateral limb pain syndrome, [[postherpetic neuralgia]] and acute [[herpes zoster]] pain. Another pain condition that is a potential candidate for SCS treatment is [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth]] (CMT) disease, which is associated with moderate to severe chronic extremity pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1403.2009.00272.x |author1=Skaribas I.M. |author2=Washburn S.N. |title=Successful treatment of charcot-marie-tooth chronic pain with spinal cord stimulation: A case study |journal=Neuromodulation |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=224–8 |date=January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SCS therapy consists of the electrical stimulation of the spinal cord to 'mask' pain. The [[gate theory]] proposed in 1965 by [[Melzack]] and [[Wall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Melzack R, Wall PD |title=Pain mechanisms: a new theory |journal=Science |volume=150 |issue=3699 |pages=971–9 |date=November 1965 |pmid=5320816 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=5320816 |doi=10.1126/science.150.3699.971 |bibcode=1965Sci...150..971M}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided a theoretical construct to attempt SCS as a clinical treatment for chronic pain. This theory postulates that activation of large diameter, myelinated primary [[afferent fibers]] suppresses the response of [[posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]] neurons to input from small, unmyelinated primary afferents.
A simple SCS system consists of three different parts. First, microelectrodes are implanted in the epidural space to deliver stimulation pulses to the tissue. Second, an electrical pulse generator implanted in the lower abdominal area or [[gluteal region]] while is connected to the electrodes via wires, and third a remote control to adjust the stimulus parameters such as pulse width and pulse rate in the PG. Improvements have been made in both the clinical aspects of SCS such as transition from subdural placement of contacts to epidural placement, which reduces the risk and morbidity of SCS implantation, and also technical aspects of SCS such as improving percutaneous leads, and fully implantable multi-channel stimulators. However, there are many parameters that need to be optimized including number of implanted contacts, contact size and spacing, and electrical sources for stimulation. The stimulus pulse width and pulse rate are important parameters that need to be adjusted in SCS, which are typically 400 us and 8–200&amp;nbsp;Hz respectively.&lt;ref name=zho/&gt;

== Cochlear implants ==
[[File:Cochlear implant.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Cochlear implant]]
[[Cochlear implants]] have provided partial hearing to more than 120,000 persons worldwide as of 2008. The electrical stimulation is used in a cochlear implant to provide functional hearing in totally deafened persons. Cochlear implants include several subsystem components from the external speech processor and [[radio frequency]] (RF) transmission link to the internal receiver, stimulator, and electrode arrays. Modern cochlear implant research started in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1961, a crude single electrode device was implanted in two deaf patients and useful hearing with electric stimulation was reported. The first FDA approved complete single channel device was released in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=House WF, Urban J |title=Long term results of electrode implantation and electronic stimulation of the cochlea in man |journal=Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=504–17 |year=1973 |pmid=4721186 |doi=10.1177/000348947308200408}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In cochlear implants, the sound is picked up by a microphone and transmitted to the behind-the-ear external processor to be converted to the digital data. The digitized data is then modulated on a radio frequency signal and transmitted to an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] inside a headpiece. The data and power carrier are transmitted through a pair of coupled coils to the hermetically sealed internal unit. By extracting the power and demodulating the data, electric current commands are sent to the [[cochlea]] to stimulate the auditory nerve through microelectrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=An SK, Park SI, Jun SB, etal |title=Design for a simplified cochlear implant system |journal=IEEE Trans Biomed Eng |volume=54 |issue=6 Pt 1 |pages=973–82 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17554817 |doi=10.1109/TBME.2007.895372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The key point is that the internal unit does not have a battery and it should be able to extract the required energy. Also to reduce the infection, data is transmitted wirelessly along with power. Inductively coupled coils are the best candidate for power and data telemetry. Parameters needed by the internal unit include the pulse amplitude, pulse duration, pulse gap, active electrode, and return electrode that are used to define a biphasic pulse and the stimulation mode. An example of the commercial devices include Nucleus 22 device that utilized a carrier frequency of 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz and later in the newer revision called Nucleus 24 device, the carrier frequency was increased to 5&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;P. Crosby, C. Daly, D.  Money, and et al., Aug. 1985, " Cochlear implant system for an auditory prosthesis," '' United States Patent 4532930''.&lt;/ref&gt; The internal unit in the cochlear implants is an [[ASIC]]  ([[application-specific integrated circuit]]) chip that is responsible to ensure safe and reliable electric stimulation. Inside the ASIC chip, there is a forward pathway, a backward pathway, and control units. The forward pathway recovers digital information from the RF signal which includes stimulation parameters and some handshaking bits to reduce the communication error. The backward pathway usually includes a back telemetry voltage
sampler that reads the voltage over a period of time on the recording electrode. The stimulator block is responsible to deliver predetermined current by external unit to the microelectrodes. This block includes a reference current and a [[digital to analog converter]] to transform digital commands to an analog current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ghovanloo M. |author2=Najafi K. |title=A modular 32-site wireless neural stimulation microsystem |journal=IEEE J.

== Visual prosthesis ==
[[File:ImplantSawan.JPG|thumb|alt=Visual cortical implant designed by Mohamad Sawan|The Visual Cortical Implant]]
Theoretical and experimental clinical evidences suggest that direct electrical stimulation of the retina might be able to provide some vision to subjects who have lost the photoreceptive elements of their [[retina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clausen J |title=Visual sensations (phosphenes) produced by AC sine wave stimulation |journal=Acta Psychiatr Neurol Scand Suppl |volume=94 |pages=1–101 |year=1955 |pmid=13258326 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[visual prosthesis|visual prostheses]] are developed to restore vision for the blind by using the stimulation. Depending upon which [[visual pathway]] location is targeted for neural stimulation, different approaches have been considered. Visual pathway consists mainly of the [[human eye|eye]], [[optic nerve]], [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] (LGN), and [[visual cortex]]. Therefore, retinal, optic nerve and visual cortex stimulation are the three different methods used in visual prostheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/JPROC.2008.922589 |author1=Weiland J.D. |author2=Humayun M.S. |title=Visual prosthesis |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=96 |issue=7 |pages=1076–84 |date=July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Retinal degenerative diseases, such as [[retinitis pigmentosa]] (RP) and [[age-related macular degeneration]] (AMD), are two likely candidate diseases in which retinal stimulation may be helpful. Three approaches called intraocular epiretinal, subretinal and extraocular transretinal stimulation are pursued in retinal devices that stimulate remaining retinal neural cells to bypass lost photoreceptors and allow the visual signal to reach the brain via the normal visual pathway. In epiretinal approach, electrodes are placed on the top side of the retina near [[retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cells]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Humayun MS, de Juan E, Dagnelie G, Greenberg RJ, Propst RH, Phillips DH |title=Visual perception elicited by electrical stimulation of retina in blind humans |journal=Arch.

Second Sight and the Humayun group at USC are the most active groups in the design of intraocular retinal prostheses. The ArgusTM 16 retinal implant is an intraocular retinal prosthesis utilizing video processing technologies.
Regarding to the visual cortex stimulation, Brindley, and Dobelle were the first ones who did the experiments and demonstrated that by stimulating the top side of the visual cortex most of the electrodes can produce visual percept.&lt;ref name=zho/&gt; More recently Sawan built a complete implant for intracortical stimulation and validated the operation in rats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sawan|first1=Mohamad|url=mohamadsawan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pacemaker GuidantMeridianSR.jpg|thumb|right|A pacemaker, scale in centimeters]]
LGN, which is located in the midbrain to relay signals from the retina to the visual cortex, is another potential area that can be used for stimulation. But this area has limited access due to surgical difficulty. The recent success of deep brain stimulation techniques targeting the [[midbrain]] has encouraged research to pursue the approach of LGN stimulation for a visual prosthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pezaris JS, Reid RC |title=Demonstration of artificial visual percepts generated through thalamic microstimulation |journal=Proc.

== Cardiac electrostimulation devices ==
{{Further|Artificial cardiac pacemaker}}
[[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|Implantable pacemakers]] were proposed for the first time in 1959 and became more sophisticated since then. The therapeutic application of pacemakers consists of numerous [[heart arrythmia|rhythm disturbances]] including some forms of [[tachycardia]] (too fast a heart beat), [[heart failure]], and even [[stroke]]. Early implantable pacemakers worked only a short time and needed periodic recharging by an inductive link. These implantable pacemakers needed a pulse generator to stimulate heart [[muscles]] with a certain rate in addition to electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Elmvquist R. |author2=Senning A. |chapter=Implantable pacemaker for the heart |editor=Smyth CN |title=Medical electronics |publisher=Iliffe &amp; Sons  |location=Paris |year=1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, modern pulse generators are programmed non-invasively by sophisticated computerized machines using RF, obtaining information about the patient's and device's status by telemetry. Also they use a single hermetically sealed [[lithium iodide]] (LiI) cell as the battery. The pacemaker circuitry includes sense amplifiers to detect the heart's intrinsic electrical signals, which are used to track heart activity, rate adaptive circuitry, which determine the need for increased or reduced pacing rate, a microprocessor, memory to store the parameters, telemetry control for communication protocol and power supplies to provide regulated voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Warren J. |author2=Nelson J. |chapter=Pacemakers and ICD pulse generator circuitry |veditors=Ellenbogen KA, Kay GN, Wilkoff BL |title=Clinical cardiac pacing and defibrillation |publisher=WB Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2000 |pages=194–216 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stimulation microelectrode technologies ==
[[File:Utah array pat5215088.jpg|thumb|300px|right| Utah microelectrode array]]
Microelectrodes are one of the key components of the neurostimulation, which deliver the current to neurons. Typical microelectrodes have three main components: a substrate (the ''carrier''), a conductive metal layer, and an insulation material. In cochlear implants, microelectrodes are formed from [[platinum-iridium alloy]]. State-of-the-art electrodes include deeper insertion to better match the [[tonotopic]] place of stimulation to the frequency band assigned to each electrode channel, improving efficiency of stimulation, and reducing insertion related trauma. These cochlear implant electrodes are either straight or spiral such as Med El Combi 40+ and Advanced Bionics Helix microelectrodes respectively.
In visual implants, there are two types of electrode arrays called planar type or three dimensional needle or pillar type, where needle type array such as Utah array is mostly used for cortical and optic nerve stimulations and rarely used in retinal implants due to the possible damage of retina. However, a pillar-shaped gold electrode array on thin-film [[polyimide]] has been used in an extraocular implant. On the other hand, planar electrode arrays are formed from flexible polymers, such as [[silicone]], polyimide, and [[parylene]] as candidates for retinal implants.
Regarding to DBS microelectrodes an array, which can be controlled independently, distributed throughout the target nucleus would permit precise control of the spatial distribution of the stimulation, and thus, allow better personalized DBS. There are several requirements for DBS microelectrodes that include long lifetime without injury to the tissue or degradation of the electrodes, customized for different brain sites, long-term [[biocompatibility]] of the material, mechanically durable in order to reach the target without being damaged during handling by the implant surgeon, and finally uniformity of performance across the microelectrodes in a particular array. [[Tungsten]] microwire, iridium microwires, and sputtered or electrodeposited&lt;ref&gt;http://www.platinumgroupcoatings.com/#!technology/c1l1j&lt;/ref&gt; [[Platinum-iridium alloy]] microelectrodes are the examples of microelectrode used in DBS.&lt;ref name=zho/&gt; [[Silicon carbide]] is a potential interesting material for realizing biocompatible semiconductor devices.&lt;ref name=saddow&gt;{{cite book |author=Saddow SE|title=Silicon Carbide Biotechnology: A Biocompatible Semiconductor for Advanced Biomedical Devices and Applications |publisher=Elsevier LTD |year=2011 |isbn=0-12385-906-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The primary findings about neurostimulation originated from the idea to stimulate nerves for therapeutic purposes. The 1st recorded use of electrical stimulation for pain relief goes back to 46 AD, when [[Scribonius Largus]] used torpedo fish (electric ray) for relieving headaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/036354658501300105 |vauthors=Jensen JE, Conn RR, Hazelrigg G, Hewett JE |title=The use of transcutaneous neural stimulation and isokinetic testing in arthroscopic knee surgery |journal=Am J Sports Med |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=27–33 |year=1985 |pmid=3872082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th century, [[Luigi Galvani]] discovered that the muscles of dead frog legs twitched when struck by direct current on the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Galvani.html |title=Galvani, Luigi (1737–1798) |author=Weisstein, Eric W. |work=Eric Weisstein's World of Scientific Biography |year=2002 |publisher=Wolfram Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modulation of the [[brain]] activity by electrical stimulation of the motor cortex in dogs was shown in 1870 that resulted in limb movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fritsch G. |author2=Hitzig E. |title=Uber die elektrische Erregbarkeit des Grosshirns |journal=Arch. Anat. Physiol. |volume=37 |pages=300–332 |year=1870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the late 18th century to today many milestones have been developed. Nowadays, sensory prosthetic devices, such as visual implants, cochlear implants, auditory midbrain implants, and spinal cord stimulators and also motor prosthetic devices, such as deep brain stimulators, Bion microstimulators, the brain control and sensing interface, and cardiac electro-stimulation devices are widely used.&lt;ref name=zho&gt;{{cite book |author1=Greenbaum, Elias S. |author2=David Zhou |title=Implantable Neural Prostheses 1: Devices and Applications |series=Biological and Medical Physics, Biomedical Engineering |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2009 |isbn=0-387-77260-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the British pharmaceutical company [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) coined the term "electroceutical" to broadly encompass [[medical devices]] that use electrical, mechanical, or light stimulation to affect [[Action potential|electrical signaling]] in relevant tissue types.&lt;ref name=IEEE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Famm|first=Kristoffer|author2=Litt, Brian |author3=Tracey, Kevin J. |author4=Boyden, Edward S. |author5= Slaoui, Moncef |title=Drug discovery: A jump-start for electroceuticals|journal=Nature|date=10 April 2013|volume=496|issue=7444|pages=159–161|doi=10.1038/496159a |pmid=23579662 |pmc=4179459|bibcode=2013Natur.496..159F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical neural implants such as [[cochlear implant]]s to restore hearing, [[retinal implant]]s to restore sight, [[spinal cord stimulator]]s for pain relief or [[artificial cardiac pacemaker|cardiac pacemakers]] and implantable [[defibrillator]]s are proposed examples of electroceuticals.&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/devices/the-vagus-nerve-a-back-door-for-brain-hacking|title = The Vagus Nerve: A Back Door for Brain Hacking|date = 29 May 2015|accessdate = 4 June 2015|website = IEEE Spectrum|publisher = |last = Moore|first = Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GSK formed a [[venture fund]] and said it would host a conference in 2013 to lay out a research agenda for the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solon|first1=Olivia|title=Electroceuticals: swapping drugs for devices|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-05/28/electroceuticals|work=Wired UK|date=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2016 review of research on interactions between the nervous and immune systems in [[autoimmune disorders]] and mentioned "electroceuticals" in passing and quotation marks, referring to neurostimulation devices in development for conditions like arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reardon|first1=Colin|title=Neuro-immune interactions in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex|journal=Immunology Letters|date=October 2016|volume=178|pages=92–96|doi=10.1016/j.imlet.2016.08.006|pmid=27542331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
In addition to the enormous usage of neurostimulation for clinical applications, it is also used widely in laboratories started dates back to 1920s by people link Delgado who used stimulation as an experimental manipulation to study basics of how the brain works. The primary works were on the reward center of the brain in which stimulation of those structures led to pleasure that requested more stimulation. Another most recent example is the electrical stimulation of the MT area of primary visual cortex to bias perception. In particular, the directionality of motion is represented in a regular way in the MT area. They presented monkeys with moving images on screen and monkey throughput was to determine what the direction is. They found that by systematically introducing some errors to the monkey's responses, by stimulating the MT area which is responsible for perceiving the motion in another direction, the monkey responded to somewhere in between the actual motion and the stimulated one. This was an elegant use of stimulation to show that MT area is essential in the actual perception of motion. Within the [[memory]] field, stimulation is used very frequently to test the strength of the connection between one bundle of cells to another by applying a small current in one cell which results in the release of neurotransmitters and measuring the [[postsynaptic potential]].

Generally, a short but high-frequency current in the range of 100&amp;nbsp;Hz helps strengthening the connection known as [[long-term potentiation]]. However, longer but low-frequency current tends to weaken the connections known as [[long-term depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Dr. J. Manns, Emory University, Oct. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;tends to weaken the connections known as [[long-term depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Dr. J. Manns, Emory University, Oct. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7199">[[Image:Germ layers.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[endoderm]] of [[vertebrates]] produces tissue within the [[lung]]s, [[thyroid]], and [[pancreas]]. The [[mesoderm]] aids in the production of [[cardiac muscle]], [[skeletal muscle]], [[smooth muscle]], tissues within the [[kidney]]s, and [[red blood cell]]s. The [[ectoderm]] produces tissues within the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and aids in the formation of [[neuron]]s within the brain, and [[melanocytes]].]]

In [[Embryogenesis|animal development]], '''organogenesis''' is the phase of embryonic development that starts at the end of [[gastrulation]] and goes until birth. During organogenesis, the three germ layers formed from gastrulation: the [[ectoderm]], [[endoderm]], and [[mesoderm]] form the [[internal organ]]s of the organism &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=S. F.|last2=Barresi|first2=M. J. F.|date=2017-05-01|title=DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY, 11TH EDITION 2016|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ajmg.a.38166|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A|volume=173|issue=5|pages=1430–1430|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.38166|issn=1552-4833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cells of each of the three germ layers undergo differentiation, a process where less-specialized cells become more-specialized through the expression of a specific set of genes. Cell differentiation is driven by cell signaling cascades. Differentiation is influenced by extracellular signals such as growth factors that are exchanged to adjacent cells which is called juxtracrine signaling or to neighboring cells over short distances which is called paracrine signaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edlund|first=Helena|date=July 2002|title=Organogenesis: Pancreatic organogenesis — developmental mechanisms and implications for therapy|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrg841|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=3|issue=7|pages=524–532|doi=10.1038/nrg841|issn=1471-0064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intracellular signals consist of a cell signaling itself (autocrine signaling), also play a role in organ formation. These signaling pathways allows for cell rearrangement and ensures that organs form at specific sites within the organism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The organogenesis process can be studied using embryos and organoids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ader|first=Marius|last2=Tanaka|first2=Elly M|title=Modeling human development in 3D culture|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0955067414000842|journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology|volume=31|pages=23–28|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2014.06.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organs produced by the germ layers ==

The '''endoderm''' is the inner most germ layer of the embryo which gives rise to gastrointestinal and respiratory organs by forming epithelial linings and organs such as the liver, lungs, and pancreas.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiecker|first=Clemens|last2=Bates|first2=Thomas|last3=Bell|first3=Esther|date=2016-03-01|title=Molecular specification of germ layers in vertebrate embryos|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-015-2092-y|journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|volume=73|issue=5|pages=923–947|doi=10.1007/s00018-015-2092-y|issn=1420-682X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''mesoderm''' or middle germ layer of the embryo will form the blood, heart, kidney, muscles, and connective tissues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The '''ectoderm''' or outermost germ layer of the developing embryo forms epidermis, the brain, and the nervous system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Development of the neural tube.png|thumb|598x598px|Neural precursor cells fold and elongate to form the neural tube. Mesoderm cells condense to form a rod which will send out signals to redirect the ectoderm cells above. This fold along the neural tube sets up the vertebrate central nervous system.]]

== Mechanism of organ formation ==

While each germ layer forms specific organs, in the 1820's, embryologist [[Heinz Christian Pander]] discovered that the germ layers cannot form their respective organs without the cellular interactions from other tissues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In humans, internal organs begin to develop within 3–8 weeks after fertilization. The [[germ layer]]s form organs by three processes: folds, splits, and condensation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/animal-development/Embryonic-induction#ref526397|title=Animal development - Embryonic induction|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folds form in the germinal sheet of cells and usually form an enclosed tube which you can see in the development of vertebrates neural tube. Splits or pockets may form in the germinal sheet of cells forming vesicles or elongations. The lungs and glands of the organism may develop this way.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A primary step in organogenesis for chordates is the development of the [[notochord]], which induces the formation of the [[neural plate]], and ultimately the [[neural tube]] In vertebrate development, the development of the neural tube will give rise to the brain and spinal cord.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Vertebrates develop a [[neural crest]] that differentiates into many structures, including bones, muscles, and components of the [[Peripheral nervous system|central nervous system]]. Differentiation of the ectoderm into the neural crest, neural tube, and surface ectoderm is sometimes referred to as neurulation and the embryo in this phase is the neurula. The [[coelom]] of the body forms from a split of the mesoderm along the [[Somite|somite axis]] &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Plant organogenesis ==
In plants, organogenesis, which is simply the process of forming new organs, occurs continuously and only stops when the plant dies. In the [[shoot]], the [[shoot apical meristem]]s regularly produce new lateral organs ([[leaf|leaves]] or [[flower]]s) and lateral branches. In the [[root]], new [[lateral root]]s form from weakly differentiated internal tissue (e.g. the xylem-pole [[pericycle]] in the model plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''). ''In vitro'' and in response to specific cocktails of hormones (mainly [[auxin]]s and [[cytokinin]]s), most plant tissues can de-differentiate and form a mass of dividing [[Cell potency|totipotent]] stem cells called a [[callus (cell biology)|callus]]. ''  organogenesis can then occur from those cells. The type of organ that is formed depends on the relative concentrations of the hormones in the medium. Plant organogenesis can be induced in tissue culture and used to regenerate plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://passel.unl.edu/pages/informationmodule.php?idinformationmodule=956783940&amp;topicorder=3&amp;maxto=10&amp;minto=1|title=Plant and Soil Sciences eLibrary|website=passel.unl.edu|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pokémon HeartGold Version''''' and '''''SoulSilver Version'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|''Pokémon HeartGold Version'' and ''SoulSilver Version''|ポケットモンスターハートゴールド・ソウルシルバー|Poketto Monsutā Hātogōrudo &amp; Sōrushirubā|"Pocket Monsters: HeartGold &amp; SoulSilver"}}}} are [[Video game remake|enhanced remakes]] of the 1999 video games [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], including the features in ''[[Pokémon Crystal]]''. The games are part of the fourth generation of the [[Pokémon (video game series)|''Pokémon'' series]] of [[role-playing video game]]s, and were developed by [[Game Freak]], published by [[The Pokémon Company]] and [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. The games were released in Japan on September 12, 2009, and were later released in other countries during March 2010.

''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'' take place in the Johto region of the franchise's fictional universe, which features special creatures called Pokémon. The basic goal of the game is to become the best Pokémon trainer in the Johto and [[Kanto (Pokémon)|Kanto]] regions, which is done by raising and cataloging Pokémon and defeating other trainers.

Game director [[Shigeki Morimoto]] aimed to respect the feelings of those who played the previous games, while also ensuring that it felt like a new game to those that were introduced to the series in more recent years. The games have received positive reviews from critics, and as of March 2014, the games' combined sales have reached 12.72 million, making the two games combined the [[List of best-selling Nintendo DS games|eighth best-selling DS game]] of all time.&lt;ref name=mar14&gt;{{ cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/sales/software/ds.html|title=Top Selling Software Sales Units - Nintendo DS Software|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2014-03-31|accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{See also|Gameplay of Pokémon}}
[[File:HGSSgameplay.jpg|thumb|left|The player first encounters a member of [[Pokémon crime syndicates#Team Rocket|Team Rocket]] in Slowpoke Well. The player's [[Totodile]], who is one of the game's three possible Starter Pokémon, follows him.|alt=A pre-teenaged boy with black hair and a black and yellow baseball cap stands inside a dark, rocky, cave-like area. A small, blue, crocodile-like Pokémon stands behind him. Standing elsewhere in the area are two young men and one young woman, all wearing black clothes and beanies, and two small, pink, quadrupedal Pokémon.]]
''Pokémon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'' are [[role-playing video game]]s with [[adventure game|adventure]] elements. The basic mechanics of the games are largely the same as their predecessors'. As with all ''Pokémon'' games for [[handheld game console|hand-held consoles]], gameplay is viewed from a [[Grammatical person#Use of grammatical person in creative media|third-person]] overhead perspective, and consists of three basic screens: a [[overworld|field map]], in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures his party, items, or gameplay settings. The player begins the game with one Pokémon and can capture more using [[Poké Ball]]s. The player can also use the Pokémon to battle or deceive others, often forming alliances or trends via the Team Rocket networks.&lt;ref name="ign review"&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://ds.ign.com/articles/107/1077337p1.html|title= Pokemon HeartGold Review – Nintendo DS Review at IGN|accessdate=2010-03-22 |last=Harris |first=Craig |work=[[IGN]] |date=2010-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the player [[random encounter|encounters a wild Pokémon]] or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a [[turn-based]] battle screen where the Pokémon fight. During battle, the player may [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Pokémon moves|fight]], use an item, switch the active Pokémon, or flee (the last is not an option in battles against trainers). Pokémon have [[hit points]] (HP), which is displayed during combat; when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle unless taken to a [[Pokémon Center]] or healed or revived with a Pokémon skill or item. If the player's Pokémon defeats the opposing Pokémon (causes it to faint), it receives [[experience points]]. After accumulating enough experience points, it will [[experience point#Level-based progression|level up]]; most Pokémon [[Pokémon evolution|evolve]] into a new species of Pokémon when they reach a certain level, or when certain conditions are met (commonly, how much a Pokémon statistically 'likes' its trainer).&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt;

===New features===
''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'' allow the first Pokémon in the player's party to follow them, echoing a mechanic in ''[[Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition|Pokémon Yellow]]'' in which [[Pikachu]] follows the player. Apart from ''Yellow'', this mechanic was also used in [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'', ''Pearl'']], and [[Pokémon Platinum|''Platinum'']] in a limited fashion: when the player is in Amity Park with a cute Pokémon. The player may talk to the Pokémon to see or check on how that Pokémon is feeling, and occasionally it may pick up items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3174822|title=Pokémon Gold/Silver Remakes Feature Hot Walking Action|work=[[1UP.com]]|first=Kevin|last=Gifford|date=2009-06-17|accessdate=2009-08-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A2yx194O?url=http://www.1up.com/news/pokemon-goldsilver-remakes-feature-hot|archivedate=2012-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new [[minigame]] called the Pokéathlon (called Pokéthlon in Japan) uses the Nintendo DS touchscreen and allows Pokémon to compete in events such as [[hurdling]].&lt;ref name="ignhandson"/&gt; The Japanese versions retain [[slot machines]] found in previous games, while the international releases of the titles replace the slot machines with a new game called "Voltorb Flip", described as a cross between [[Minesweeper (computer game)|Minesweeper]] and [[Picross]].&lt;ref name="ONM UK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/article.php?id=14990|title=Pokémon HeartGold/SoulSilver mini-game revealed|accessdate=2010-03-25|last=Scullion|first=Chris|date=2010-02-03|publisher=Official Nintendo Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another new item, the GB Sounds, changes the background music to the original 8-bit music from [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bingegamer.net/2010/03/review-pokemon-heart-goldsoul-silver/|title=Review: Pokemon Heart Gold/Soul Silver|last=Piekarski|first=Perry|date=2010-03-19|publisher=Bingegamer|accessdate=2010-11-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126155013/http://www.bingegamer.net/2010/03/review-pokemon-heart-goldsoul-silver/|archivedate=2010-11-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot and setting==
&lt;!-- According to Wikipedia:When to cite, the work itself is implied as the source --&gt;
Similar to [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], ''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'' take place in the [[Johto (Pokémon)|Johto]] and [[Kanto (Pokémon)|Kanto]] regions of the franchise's fictional universe. The universe centers on the existence of creatures, called [[Pokémon]], with special abilities. The silent [[protagonist]] is a young Pokémon trainer who lives in a small town referred to as New Bark Town. At the beginning of the games, the player chooses either a [[Chikorita]], [[Cyndaquil]], or [[Totodile]] as their [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Starter Pokémon|starter Pokémon]] from [[List of Pokémon anime characters#Professor Elm|Professor Elm]]. After performing a delivery for the professor and obtaining a [[Pokédex]], he decides to let the player keep the Pokémon and start them on a journey.

The goal of the game is to become the best trainer in Johto and [[Kanto (Pokémon)|Kanto (the main region of the first games)]], which is done by raising Pokémon, completing a catalogue of Pokémon called a Pokédex, defeating the eight [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Pokémon Gyms|Gym Leaders]] in Johto for Gym Badges, challenging the best trainers in the region known as the [[Elite Four]] and the Champion, and then defeating the eight Gym Leaders in the Kanto region. Finally, the player may face off against [[List of Pokémon characters#Protagonists|Red]] atop Mt. Silver, who serves as the game's final [[boss (video gaming)|boss]].

Throughout the game, the player will battle against members of [[Team Rocket]], a criminal organization originally from [[Kanto (Pokémon)|Kanto]]. They were originally defeated by the protagonist of [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']], and have attempted to come back as an organization, while awaiting the return of their leader, [[Giovanni (Pokémon)|Giovanni]]. To attempt to contact him, they take over the radio tower and broadcast a message calling out to him.

While being the remakes of ''Gold '' and ''Silver'', the games tie in plot elements of ''Crystal'' as well, such as the added emphasis on Suicune over the other legendary beasts, as well as the post-ending Battle Frontier. (In ''Crystal'', only the Battle Tower was available.) Additionally, Johto and Kanto were given Generation IV features such as Pal Park.

During certain points in the game, [[Silver (Pokémon)|the player's rival]] will battle the protagonist in a test of skills. Throughout the game, the player encounters [[Kimono]] Girls&lt;!-- some more context might be helpful--&gt;. After battling all of them in a row, they allow the player to encounter a legendary Pokémon specific to each game ([[Ho-Oh]] in ''HeartGold'', and [[Lugia]] in ''SoulSilver''). As per the originals, the other Pokémon can be obtained later on.

==Development==
{{quote box|align   = right|width   = 25em|With ''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'', the way in which trainers and Pokémon relate has become a major theme and this has been added to the story. We came up with the titles ''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'' as we decided these were appropriate to express this theme.|source  =  —Shigeki Morimoto on one of the differences between the remakes and the originals&lt;ref name="Morimoto"/&gt;}}
''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'' were released in 2009, ten years after ''Gold'' and ''Silver''{{'}}s release for the [[Game Boy Color]]. Shigeki Morimoto, the games' director, commented on the development of the remakes: "The first thing that I knew I needed to bear in mind was to respect the feelings of those people who'd played ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' ten years before. I think that players have very strong memories of the game, so they'd think things like 'Ah, this trainer is still strong' and 'If I do this here, this is going to happen'. I knew I needed to respect these feelings."&lt;ref name="Morimoto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/iwata/iwata_asks_-_pokmon_heartgold_version__soulsilver_version_16288_16289.html#top|title=Iwata Asks – Pokémon HeartGold Version &amp; Pokémon SoulSilver Version|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=2010-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Morimoto also needed to make sure that the games would feel as new games to players who began playing ''Pokémon'' in recent years on the [[Game Boy Advance]] or the [[Nintendo DS]].&lt;ref name="Morimoto"/&gt; An in-game [[author surrogate]] of Game Freak's President in Celadon City states that the team strove to make a game that would appeal to players with fond memories without "redoing the same thing". He also states that making the game was a "rewarding challenge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon SoulSilver|developer=Game Freak|quote='''President of Game Freak:''' What do you think? I am the President here. We are remaking an old game, but this is quite a challenge. Old fans would not want us to mess with their good memories... but there is no point in just redoing the same thing, right? We are working toward something that brings back memories, yet is also completely new! I've been in this business for 20 years now, but creating a game is always a rewarding challenge!}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'' introduced many [[#New features|new features]] that were absent in the original ''Gold'' and ''Silver''. Several of these features came from the previously released Nintendo DS ''Pokémon'' games, such as [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'']] (2006), [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pearl'']] (2006), and [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl#Pokémon Platinum|''Platinum'']] (2008).&lt;ref name="Morimoto"/&gt;

===Marketing and release===
An initial rumor started in early May 2009 that Nintendo planned to remake ''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'' after the Japanese television show ''[[Pokémon Sunday]]'' ended by announcing a "world-exclusive first announcement" that would be made on its next show. Kris Pigna of [[1UP.com]] speculated that this alluded to a possible remake of ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' for the [[Nintendo DS]], due to gold and silver disco balls hanging in the background. Pigna further reasoned that this would be consistent with the previously released titles [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']] which were enhanced remakes of the original [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3174040|title=Nintendo Planning Pokemon Gold/Silver Remake?|publisher=1UP.com|first=Kris|last=Pigna|date=2009-05-03|accessdate=2009-08-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DbamWvm2?url=http://www.1up.com/news/nintendo-planning-pokemon-goldsilver-remake|archivedate=2013-01-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, Nintendo officially confirmed that ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' were being remade as ''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'' and released their official logos. It also announced that the games would contain numerous updates, although declined to reveal any specifics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/980/980931p1.html|title=New Pokemon Games Confirmed|publisher=IGN|first=John|last=Tanaka|date=2009-05-07|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The games were released for the [[Nintendo DS]] on September 12, 2009 in Japan to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the original ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.idg.no/cw/art.cfm?id=221D84C3-1A64-6A71-CE9115735E86EB1E|title=Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver confirmed for DS in 2009|publisher=[[Computerworld]]|first=McKinley|last=Noble|date=2009-05-08|accessdate=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Junichi Masuda]] stated on his blog that "we, Game Freak have spent long and firm time developing above two titles{{sic}}", and that "'Pokémon Gold &amp; Silver' will be back with far more excitement."&lt;ref name="masuda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=182|title=Hidden Power of Masuda|publisher=[[Game Freak]]|first=Junichi|last=Masuda|authorlink=Junichi Masuda|date=2009-05-27|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2009 Pokémon World Championships, Nintendo stated that ''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'' would be released in North America between the months of January and March, Europe sometime around May and June, and Australia in April. "Announcing these much-anticipated game launches at The Pokémon World Championships allows us to give the news directly to the legions of fans who represent the true heart and soul of Pokémon," a spokesperson said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090814005140/en|title=Two New Pokémon Games Announced for Nintendo DS|publisher=[[Business Wire]]|first=Golin|last=Harris|date=2009-08-14|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo updated the official Pokémon English website with information about the new titles, telling readers that the games would feature revamped audiovisual effects, interaction with the DS [[Nintendo DS#Input and output|touch screen]], and more "surprises".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.com/#heartgoldsoulsilver|title=Return to the Johto Region!|publisher=[[The Pokémon Company]]|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; From February 27 to March 13, 2010, video game retailer [[GameStop]] hosted a promotion in which players of [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'', ''Pearl'', or ''Platinum'']] could use the games' "Mystery Gift" feature to download a free [[Jirachi]] Pokémon to their game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GameStop distributing legendary Jirachi Pokemon starting Feb. 27|url=http://www.neoseeker.com/news/13197-gamestop-distributing-legendary-jirachi-pokemon-starting-feb-27/|publisher=Neoseeker|date=February 22, 2010|accessdate=March 6, 2010|last=Argueta|first=Dany}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "[[Pikachu]]-colored [[Pichu]]" could be downloaded using Wi-Fi that, when taken to the Ilex Forest in-game, unlocked a "Spiky-eared Pichu".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aussie-nintendo.com/news/21755/|title= Shiny Pichu Pokemon Event starts today over Wi-Fi - News - Aussie-Nintendo.com|date= March 5, 2010|author= Lucario|publisher= Aussie-nintendo|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6DbfZ5BUC?url=http://www.aussie-nintendo.com/news/21755/|archivedate= January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the news confirming the development of ''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'', fans posted their reactions and commentary on the [[Internet]]. In particular, [[IGN]] editor Jack DeVries reasoned that the primary reason for the updated games was to be compatible with [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']], allowing players to collect old Pokémon species that were previously unobtainable in the new games. He also expressed skepticism that the new titles could match the quality of the originals; stating, "For me, ''Gold''/''Silver'' were amazing because they introduced so many new features that have since become standards for the series. It was the first, and only, time the ''Pokémon'' games have made such a significant expansion. These days we're lucky if we get a new feature that invisibly changes the strategic elements of the game." He reminisced over the qualities that made ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' truly unique, including the full color support, internal clock, [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Pokémon breeding|Pokémon breeding]], and PokéGear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/980/980866p1.html|title=Pokemon Report: Go for the Gold (And Silver)|publisher=IGN|first=Jack|last=DeVries|date=2009-05-08|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later, after DeVries had played through some of the game, he wrote, "so far I like what I see, even if it all feels very familiar and formulaic at this point."&lt;ref name="ignhandson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/105/1052373p1.html|title=Pokemon SoulSilver Hands-on|publisher=IGN|first=Jack|last=DeVries|date=2009-12-04|accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The games' reception has been highly positive, having an aggregate score of 87 on Metacritic. The titles are among the Top 20 rated DS games in the site's database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/ds?view=condensed&amp;sort=desc |title=List of DS Games by Score |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' awarded the games a composite score of 37 out of 40 based on four individual reviews, of which the ratings were 9, 10, 9, and 9. The reviewers praised the games for retaining much of the quality that drew them to the original ''Gold'' and ''Silver''. The only drawback mentioned was that the games brought "no major surprises".&lt;ref name="famitsu"/&gt; ''Nintendo Power'' gave the games one of the highest scores, remarking on its replay value though criticizing shortly about no improvement in graphic animation for Pokémon sprites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nintendo Power]] Apr 2010, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' stated that they were the best ''Pokémon'' games yet.&lt;ref name="ONM"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Annette Gonzalez stated "Even though the classic ''Pokémon'' formula still works as evidenced by ''HeartGold''. I can’t help but hope for a new ''Pokémon'' title that breaks some new ground."&lt;ref name="gameinformer"/&gt;

[[IGN]]'s Craig Harris said that the titles were "like a gap filler to make the wait for a new Pokémon game just a little more bearable".&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Jim Sterling of [[Destructoid]] stated, "While it is, at its core, the same game that you've played many years ago, it still manages to feel new and the updated features bolster the original experience in a manner that never intrudes and only enhances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-pokemon-heartgold-soulsilver-166893.phtml |title=Review: Pokemon HeartGold / SoulSilver |accessdate=2010-03-28 |last=Sterling |first=Jim |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |date=2010-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1UP.com]]'s Justin Haywald stated that "''HeartGold''/''SoulSilver'' is easily the best ''Pokémon'' game yet".&lt;ref name="1UP"/&gt; VideoGamer.com reviewer Jamin Smith said, "With ''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'' the ''Pokémon'' series has reached a point where it can't get any better."&lt;ref name="VG.com"/&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Keza MacDonald gave the games a 9/10, stating "They combine everything that was best about the older ''Pokémon'' games", citing the Pokémon designs and improved graphics and battle system.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; ''[[GamePro]]''{{'}}s McKinley Noble stated that "it's clear that this is a perfect experience for both old-school trainers and the newest generation of ''Pokémon'' fans."&lt;ref name="GamePro"/&gt; ''GameZone''{{'s}} Cliff Bakehorn III said, "There is not a doubt in my mind: ''Pokémon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'' are the pinnacle of the entire series."&lt;ref name="GameZone"/&gt; Nathan Meunier of [[GameSpot]] gave the games one of the lower scores, criticizing them for a lack of innovation.&lt;ref name=gamestop&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/rpg/pokemonheartgold/review.html |title=Pokemon HeartGold Version Review for DS – GameSpot |author=Nathan Meunier |date=Apr 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamesRadar]] attributed the game's success to being a remake of classic games.

== Algorithm ==
In PBIL, genes are represented as real values in the range [0,1], indicating the probability that any particular [[allele]] appears in that [[gene]].

The PBIL algorithm is as follows:

# A population is generated from the probability vector.
# The fitness of each member is evaluated and ranked.
# Update population genotype (probability vector) based on fittest individual.
# Mutate.
# Repeat steps 1-4

== Source code ==
This is a part of source code implemented in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. In the paper, learnRate = 0.1, negLearnRate = 0.075, mutProb = 0.02, and mutShift = 0.05 is used. N = 100 and ITER_COUNT = 1000 is enough for a small problem.

                if (rand_nextDouble() &lt; probVec[k])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1748">'''Poroniec''' {{IPAc-pl|'|p|o|r|o|ń|e|c}} is a hostile and malicious demon from [[Slavic mythology]]. They were believed to come into existence from stillborn fetuses, but also from improperly buried remains of children who had died during infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Podgórscy|first1=Barbara i Adam|title=Wielka księga demonów polskich: leksykon i antologia demonologii ludowej|date=2005|publisher=Wydawn. Kos|location=Katowice|isbn=978-83-89375-40-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folklore==

A poroniec is somewhat similar to a being from [[Scandinavian folklore]] - [[Myling]]. Porońce (plural) were considered to be extremely powerful demons, due to their potential of unrealized life.&lt;ref name=Szyjewski&gt;{{cite book|last1=Szyjewski|first1=Andrzej|title=Religia Słowian|date=2003|publisher=Wydawn. WAM|location=Kraków|isbn=978-83-7318-205-9|edition=Wyd. 2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Porońce were associated with many taboos regarding pregnant women, such as prohibition of drawing water from the well, prohibition of leaving home with an infant and prohibition of engaging in sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=Szyjewski /&gt;

Stillborn fetus did not turn into a poroniec if it was buried under the threshold of the house. Instead, it turned into a [[kłobuk]] – a [[Household deity|protective house spirit]].&lt;ref name=Szyjewski /&gt;

==In popular culture==
*In 2015 videogame ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]'', part of one the main quest revolves around the search of a botchling ("poroniec" in the original version) that can be killed or turned into a [[lubberkin]] ("kłobuk").

'''Quality, cost, delivery (QCD)''', sometimes expanded to '''QCDMS''' ([[Quality (business)|Quality]], [[Cost]], Delivery, [[Morale]], Safety),&lt;ref name=Gemba&gt;{{cite book|last=Imai|first=Masaaki|title=Gemba Kaizen: A Commonsense, Low-Cost Approach to Management|year=1997|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-136816-2|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[management]] approach originally developed to help companies  within the [[Automotive industry in the United Kingdom|British automobile sector]]. QCD analysis is used to assess different components of the [[production process]]. It also provides feedback in the form of facts and figures that help managers make logical decisions. By using the gathered data it is easier for organizations to prioritize their future goals.&lt;ref name="qcd1"&gt;{{cite web|title=QCD – Quality, Cost and Delivery|url=https://johanneswoe.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/qcd-quality-cost-and-delivery/|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

QCD helps to break down one big thing into many smaller ones, which helps organize and prioritize efforts and, psychologically, prevents the feeling of being overwhelmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QCD / Quality, Cost, Delivery|url=http://www.velaction.com/qdc-quality-delivery-cost/|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

QCD is a "three-dimensional" approach. If there is a problem with even one dimension, the others will inevitably suffer as well. One dimension cannot be sacrificed for the sake of the other two.&lt;ref name="rtd"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Domingo|first1=Rene T.|title=THE QCD APPROACH TO OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT|url=http://www.rtdonline.com/BMA/MM/qcd.htm|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits of QCD ==
QCD offers a method of measuring processes while being applicable to both simple and complicated business processes.  It also represents a basis for comparing businesses.  For example, a business measuring supplier delivery performance may easily compare its findings against other businesses' performance. But basically QDC altogether will be implemented as a single management in any corporate for man-power reduction.

== QCDF ==
[[Flexibility]] is often included as a measure to QCD resulting in Quality, Cost, Delivery and Flexibility (QCDF). Flexibility relates to the capacity to adapt to changes / modifications . The modifications could be in a)input quality b) output quality c) product specifications d) delivery schedules.

== Quality ==
Quality is the ability of a product or service to meet and exceed customer expectations. Customers' requirements determine the quality goals. It is almost always listed first, presumably because poor quality often results in bad business. Quality is the result of the efficiency of the entire production process formed of men, material, and machinery.

Even though quality is now seen as a [[competitive advantage]], US business organizations in the 1970s tended to focus more on cost and [[productivity]]. That approach led to a major share of the US market being captured by Japanese business organizations, which onces again proves that in order to be successful an organization has to focus on all three QCD dimensions together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tomaskovic-Devey|first1=Donald|last2=Lin|first2=Ken-Hou|title=Income Dynamics, Economic Rents, and the Financialization of the U.S. Economy|journal=American Sociological Review|date=August 2011|volume=76|issue=4|pages=538–559|publisher=American Sociological Association|doi=10.1177/0003122411414827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the late 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s that the factor “quality” drastically shifted and became a strategic approach created by Harvard professor [http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6459&amp;facInfo=fea David Garvin].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garvin|first1=David A.|title=Competing on the Eight Dimensions of Quality|url=https://hbr.org/1987/11/competing-on-the-eight-dimensions-of-quality|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=3 November 2015|date=November 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach focuses on preventing any mistakes and, also, puts a great emphasis on customer satisfaction.&lt;ref name="om"&gt;{{cite web|title=Operations management:Quality|url=http://mcu.edu.tw/~ychen/op_mgm/notes/part4.html|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quality basis ===
Gavin lists [[eight dimensions of quality]]:&lt;ref name="Operations Strategy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Operations Strategy|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/management/Ob-Or/Operations-Strategy.html|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=Sushil|last2=Starr|first2=Martin|title=Production and operations management systems|date=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1-4665-0733-3|pages=279–280|url=http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/manufacturing/9781466507340/chapter-8-quality-management/chapter_8_quality_management#X2ludGVybmFsX0J2ZGVwRmxhc2hSZWFkZXI/eG1saWQ9OTc4MTQ2NjUwNzM0MC8yNzk=|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''''Performance'''''
[[Performance]] is a product’s primary operating characteristics. For example, for a stereo those characteristics would include sound quality, surround sound, and wifi connectivity.
* '''''Conformance'''''
Conformance refers to the degree to which a certain product meets the customer’s expectations.
* '''''Special features'''''
Those are any additional features of a product or service. In other words, extras. An example of an extra could be free meals on an airplane, or free drinks at a museum visit. And for a TV, for example, it can be split screen, internet access, embedded apps etc.
* '''''Aesthetics'''''
[[Aesthetics]] refer to a product’s looks, sound, feel, smell, or taste. When it comes to aesthetics, complete customer satisfaction is simply impossible as it is very subjective. For example, one group of customers may like the smell of a certain perfume while other may find it completely repelling.
* '''''Durability'''''
The [[durability]] of a product is how long the product lasts before it has to be replaced. Durability can be improved by the usage of long-life materials or improved technology processes in manufacturing. Some products are expected to be more durable than others. Those often include home appliances and automobiles for which durability is a primary characteristic of quality.
* '''''Reliability'''''
Reliability refers to the time until a product breaks down and has to be repaired, but not replaced. This feature is very important for products that have expensive maintenance.
* '''''Serviceability'''''
"Serviceability is defined by speed, courtesy, competence and ease of repair." &lt;ref name="Operations Strategy" /&gt; Customers usually want products that are relatively quickly and easily serviceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=Sushil|last2=Starr|first2=Martin|title=Production and operations management systems|date=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1-4665-0733-3|page=282|url=http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/manufacturing/9781466507340/chapter-8-quality-management/chapter_8_quality_management#X2ludGVybmFsX0J2ZGVwRmxhc2hSZWFkZXI/eG1saWQ9OTc4MTQ2NjUwNzM0MC8yNzk=|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Perceived quality'''''
The [[perceived quality]] may be affected by the high price or the good aesthetics of a product.

=== Product components ===
The quality of a product depends almost entirely on the quality of the supplied materials. One cannot produce a high-quality end product from low-quality components. Suppliers and manufacturers must be willing to work together in order to reduce and eliminate errors and defects, and achieve higher quality end products. SMEs should discuss with their suppliers how quality improvements can affect the overall performance of the supply chain. A properly implemented quality procedure can reduce testing, scrap, rework, etc. This could result in a reduction of production costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Council|first1=Committee on Supply Chain Integration, Board on Manufacturing and Engineering Design, Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems, National Research|title=Surviving supply chain integration : strategies for small manufacturers|date=2000|publisher=National Acad.Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-309-06878-9|pages=52|url=http://www.nap.edu/read/6369/chapter/8#52|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Cost of poor quality|Consequences of poor quality]] ===
* '''''Business loss'''''
Poor quality often results in unsatisfied customers which leads to business loss. In an environment where the customer can easily switch to a competitor, producing poor-quality products can be fatal to an organization.
* '''''Productivity'''''
Poor-quality products must often be reworked or scrapped entirely, which reduces the amount of usable output.
* '''''[[Quality costs|Costs]]'''''&lt;ref name="om" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=Sushil|last2=Starr|first2=Martin|title=Production and operations management systems|date=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1-4665-0733-3|page=288|url=http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/manufacturing/9781466507340/chapter-8-quality-management/chapter_8_quality_management#X2ludGVybmFsX0J2ZGVwRmxhc2hSZWFkZXI/eG1saWQ9OTc4MTQ2NjUwNzM0MC8yNzk=|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costs ==
The biggest cost in most business organizations is the manufacturing cost. Production has a direct responsibility when it comes to controlling and reducing manufacturing cost.&lt;ref name="rtd" /&gt;

There are four basic types of [[manufacturing cost]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shim|first1=Jae K. Shim, Joel G. Siegel, Allison I.|title=Budgeting basics and beyond|date=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-1-118-38702-3|pages=191–202|edition=4th|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118387023.ch9/summary|accessdate=4 November 2015|doi=10.1002/9781118387023.ch9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Raw material]]s
* [[Direct labour cost variance|Direct labour]]
* Variable overhead – production costs that increase or decrease depending on the quantity produced. For example, electricity is a variable overhead. If a company increases production, it will also increase the usage of equipment, which will result in a higher electricity bill.
* [[Fixed cost|Fixed overhead]]
Those are the production cost that stay the same even if the quantity produced increases or decreases. Those costs include:
# Salaries for employees that do not work directly on the production line (e.g. security guards, safety inspectors, etc.).
# [[Depreciation]] costs
# [[Occupancy cost]]s – property taxes, building insurance, etc.

=== Cost reduction ===

Businesses have been under the pressure to drive down costs in order to be more competitive for many years. There are many books and articles nowadays that suggest different ways of reducing costs, some of which are as follows:
* Minimizing supplier costs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berk|first1=Joseph|title=Cost reduction and optimization for manufacturing and industrial companies|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0-470-64381-5|pages=117–124|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470643815.ch13/summary|accessdate=3 November 2015|doi=10.1002/9780470643815.ch13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adopting [[lean manufacturing]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alves|first1=José Roberto Xavier|last2=Alves|first2=João Murta|title=Production management model integrating the principles of lean manufacturing and sustainability supported by the cultural transformation of a company|journal=International Journal of Production Research|date=21 April 2015|volume=53|issue=17|pages=5320|doi=10.1080/00207543.2015.1033032|id=2.3 The system of lean manufacturing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eliminating waste &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bragg|first1=Steven M.|title=The controller's function the work of the managerial accountant|date=2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-1-118-26837-7|pages=423–424|edition=4th|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118268377.ch22/summary|accessdate=3 November 2015|chapter=5S ANALYSIS|doi=10.1002/9781118268377.ch22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Delivery ==
[[Logistics]] are an essential part in providing good [[Customer relationship management|customer service]] on time:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Alan Rushton, Phil Croucher, Peter|title=The handbook of logistics &amp; distribution management|date=2014|publisher=KoganPage|location=London|isbn=0-7494-6627-8|page=35|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/?id=39RZAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=management+logistics#v=onepage&amp;q=customer%20service%20and%20logistics&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voortman|first1=Craig|title=Global logistics management|date=2004|publisher=Juta Academic|location=Cape Town|isbn=0-7021-6641-3|pages=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logistics customer service can be separated into three elements (before, during and after delivery of the product):
* Pre-transaction elements
* Transaction elements
* Post-transaction elements

== Increasing profitability with QCD ==
There are seven measures used to increase profitability:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osman|first1=Ibrahim|last2=Anouze,|first2=Abdel Latef|last3=editors|first3=Ali Emrouznejad,|title=Strategic performance management and measurement using data envelopment analysis|date=2014|isbn=1-4666-4474-5|pages=132–133|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xuCWBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Delivery+schedule+achievement#v=onepage&amp;q=Delivery%20schedule%20achievement&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Not right first time (NRFT) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Colin|last2=Murgatroyd|first2=Stephen J.|title=Total quality management in the public sector : an international perspective|date=1994|publisher=Open University Press|location=Buckingham, En|isbn=978-0-335-19102-4|pages=43–44|edition=[4th ]reprint.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_pREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=not+right+first+time+management#v=onepage&amp;q=not%20right%20first%20time%20management&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Not getting things right the first time means wasted resources, effort and time. This all leads to excessive costs for the company and poor-quality, high-priced products for the customer. NRFT measures the quality of a product and is expressed in “number of defective parts per million”. The number of defective products is divided by the total quantity of finished products. This figure is then multiplied by 10^6 to get the number of defective parts per million.&lt;ref name="qcd1" /&gt;

NRFT can be measured internally (defective parts identified within the production process) or externally (defective parts identified outside the production process (e.g. by the supplier or the customer).&lt;ref name="qcd2" /&gt;

* Delivery schedule achievement (DSA)
DSA analyses how well a supplier delivers what the customer wants and when they want it. The goal is to achieve 100% on-time delivery without any special deliveries or overtime payments, which only increase the delivery cost. DSA measures the actual delivery performance against the planned delivery schedule.&lt;ref name="qcd1" /&gt;
Failed deliveries include:
# "Not on time" deliveries – both late and early.
# "Incorrect quantity deliveries".
# Both "not on time" and "incorrect quantity deliveries".&lt;ref name="qcd2" /&gt;

* People productivity (PP)
PP is measured by the time it takes (in staff hours) to produce a good-quality product. Obtaining high PP is only possible when:
# Most employees' work adds value to the process.
# Non-value added work is reduced as much as possible.
# Waste is completely eliminated .&lt;ref name="qcd2" /&gt;

* Stock turns (ST)
The ST ratio shows how quickly a company turns raw materials into finished, ready-to-be-sold products. The quicker the better. A low ST means that the money is tied up in stock, and the company has fewer funds to invest in other parts of its business.&lt;ref name="qcd1" /&gt;

* Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE)
The OEE shows how well a company uses its equipment and staff.

OEE is calculated on the base of three elements:
# Availability – compares the planned and the actual time of the process run. For example, if a machine is planned to run 100 hours a week, but in reality runs only 50, then the availability is 50%.&lt;ref name="qcd1" /&gt;
# Performance – compares the ideal output and the actual output. For example, if a certain process is planned to take 10 minutes, but actually takes 20, then the productivity is 50%.&lt;ref name="qcd1" /&gt;
# Quality – to show the quality of a product, a company has to compare the number of good parts produced with the total parts produced. If it produces 100 parts per hour but only 50 of them are of saleable standard, then quality is running at 50%.&lt;ref name="qcd1" /&gt;

* Value added per person (VAPP)
VAPP shows how well people are used to turn raw materials into finished goods. In order to calculate VAPP, three things need to be taken into account:
#  The sales value of a unit after production (output value).
#  The raw material value of a unit before production (input value).
#  The number of direct production process employees.&lt;ref name="qcd2" /&gt;

*  Floor space utilisation (FSU) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LARSON|first1=T. NICK|last2=MARCH|first2=HEATHER|last3=KUSIAK|first3=ANDREW|title=A heuristic approach to warehouse layout with class-based storage|journal=IIE Transactions|date=April 1997|volume=29|issue=4|pages=337–348|doi=10.1080/07408179708966339}}&lt;/ref&gt;
FSU measures the sales revenue generated by a square meter of factory floor space. Usually to achieve higher FSU the floor space has to be reduced. That means eliminating inventory and reducing the necessary space to a minimum.&lt;ref name="qcd2"&gt;{{cite web|title=QCD: measuring manufacturing performance|url=http://dti.gov.uk/bestpractice/assets/qcd.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20050301202411/dti.gov.uk/bestpractice/assets/qcd.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 March 2005|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the beginning of commercial aviation in the 1920s, nurses have been part of aviation and flight.  In 1958, President Eisenhower signed the [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]] to form [[NASA]].  Part of this act was to recruit nurses to work closely with medical teams to determine the fitness of astronauts for space exploration.  Nurses helped observe the effects of spaceflight on astronauts upon their return from missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lay|first=F|title=Next stop--outer space|journal=Am J Nurs|date=1959|pages=59971–973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dee O'Hara|Lt Dolores O'Hara]] and [[Shirley Sineath|Lt Shirley Sineath]] were the first nurses assigned to work with the first seven [[Project Mercury]] astronauts. O'Hara was the official staff nurse to astronauts. Before every launch she performed the pre-flight physicals including height, weight, temperatures, blood pressure measurements.&lt;ref name=NasaOral&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/OHaraDB/OHaraDB_4-23-02.htm |title =Dolores B.

These nurses had to ensure that the astronauts could manage casualties, plan for disaster control, and provide first aid in the event of an emergency. Lieutenant Shirley Sineath was assigned as a surgical nurse on the recovery team.&lt;ref name=Shirley&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=pKENlNUWPEwC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=Shirley+Sineath+nurse&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KvoDZbLJKv&amp;sig=4mPRMUkZRqSCUX-_PhpObZ_ZUUI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjw69zMu5bcAhXFjCwKHWc7BqoQ6AEIUDAK#v=onepage&amp;q=Shirley%20Sineath%20nurse&amp;f=false= |title=Women in Space - Following Valentina |author=Shayler David and Ian A.

In 1962. NASA announced the Space Nursing Program which required applicants to have a previous [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing|bachelor's degree in nursing]].

In 1991, the [[Space Nursing Society]] was founded by [[Linda Plush]] with the help of [[Martha E. Rogers|Dr. Martha Rogers]].  It is based on Rogers' Theory, the [[Science of unitary human beings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Martha|title=Nursing science and the space age|journal=Nurs Sci Q|date=1992|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.1177/089431849200500108|pmid=1538852|pages=27–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:stephen levine.gif|frame|right|Stephen Levine]] --&gt;
'''Stephen Levine''' (July 17, 1937 – January 17, 2016) was an American poet, author and teacher best known for his work on death and dying. He is one of a generation of pioneering teachers who, along with [[Jack Kornfield]], [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]] and [[Sharon Salzberg]], have made the teachings of [[Theravada Buddhism]] more widely available to students in the West. Like the writings of his colleague and close friend, [[Ram Dass]] (formerly Richard Alpert), Stephen's work is also flavoured by the devotional practices and teachings (also known as [[Bhakti Yoga]]) of the Hindu Guru [[Neem Karoli Baba]]. This aspect of his teaching may be considered one way in which his work differs from that of the more purely [[Buddhist]] oriented teachers named above. Since [[Buddhism]] is largely considered a [[non-theistic]] faith, his allusions in his teachings to a creator, which he variously terms God, The Beloved, The One and 'Uugghh,' further distinguish his work from that of other contemporary Buddhist writers. &lt;!--, although this broad ecumenicalism has begun to appear in the later writings of his friend and fellow Buddhist writer [[Jack Kornfield]].--&gt;

==Life and career==

Born in [[Albany, New York]], Levine attended the [[University of Miami]]. He published his first work, ''A Resonance of Hope,'' in 1959. After working as an editor and writer in New York City, Levine was one of the founders of the ''[[San Francisco Oracle]]'' in 1966.

He spent time helping the sick and dying, using meditation as a method of treatment; a program he shared with psychologist [[Richard Alpert]] (Ram Dass) and psychiatrist [[Elisabeth Kubler-Ross]].

The author of several books about dying, Levine and his wife Ondrea spent one year living as if it were their last.&lt;ref name="flynn1998"&gt;Flynn, Rochelle O'Gorman (March 9, 1998). "A Year to Live" By Stephen Levine [review]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Levine's son [[Noah Levine|Noah]] initially rejected his father's work, then started to teach meditation on his own.&lt;ref name="elder2002"&gt;[https://www.salon.com/2002/11/19/noah_levine/ From street thug to dharma punk.] [[Salon.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; Levine and his wife Ondrea appeared in the 2007 documentary, [http://www.meditateanddestroy.com/ Meditate and Destroy], that focuses on the life of their son [[Noah Levine]].

For many years, Stephen and Ondrea lived in near seclusion in the mountains of Northern New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;See "Embracing the Beloved" (1995) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Ondrea still lives in Northern New Mexico.&lt;ref name="youtube appeal"&gt;{{YouTube|id=DssOU6MN0FY&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=EB071E2705648B21&amp;playnext=1&amp;index=13|title=interview conducted for a benefit held at Spirit Rock Meditation Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Levine died at his home after a long illness on January 17, 2016 at the age of 78.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ramdass.org/remembering-stephen-levine-1937-2016/ Remembering Stephen Levine] Published by ramdass.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
Although drawing upon the teachings of a variety of wisdom traditions, including [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], [[Sufism]] and mystical interpretations of Christianity, Stephen's writing was most significantly informed by the teaching of the [[Theravada]] branch of Buddhism.&lt;!-- Indeed it could be said that Stephen's oft-cited definition of healing – to approach with mercy and awareness that which we have always turned away from in fear and judgement, is an elegant and succinct statement of one of the key teachings of Theravada Buddhism.--&gt;

&lt;!--'''Awareness'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;When my teacher told me, be kind to yourself, I literally went weak at the knees. It had never occurred to me!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you went into a restaurant and the people at the next table were talking to one another the way you and I talk to ourselves in our minds, you would be nauseated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;--&gt;
'''Grief Work'''

One of the most significant aspects of Stephen's work, and one for which he was perhaps best known, was his pioneering approach to working with the experience of grief. Over 34 years, Stephen and his wife Ondrea counselled concentration camp survivors and their children, Vietnam War veterans as well as victims of sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;See "Unattended Sorrow" (2007) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Although Stephen acknowledged that our experience of grief is perhaps at its most intense when a loved one dies, &lt;!--or following a ...--&gt; he also drew our attention to grief's more subtle incarnations. "Our ordinary, everyday grief" accumulates as a response to the "burdens of disappointments and disillusionment, the loss of trust and confidence that follows the increasingly less satisfactory arch of our lives."&lt;ref&gt;See "Unattended Sorrow" (2007) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid feeling this grief we "armour our hearts," which leads to a gradual deadening of our experience of the world&lt;ref&gt;. This notion of a constant subterranean murmuring of dissatisfaction may be seen as analogous to the [[Buddha]]'s definition of [[Dukkha]].&lt;/ref&gt; When a loved one dies, or indeed when our own death approaches, the intensity of the loss often renders our defenses ineffective and we are swept up by a deluge of griefs, both old and new.

==Teachers==
In the acknowledgements section of his book "Who Dies: An Investigation of Conscious Living and Conscious Dying" (1986), Stephen paid tribute to a number of spiritual teachers whose work he acknowledged to have influenced his writing. As well as crediting "years of Buddhist practice and teaching," he cited the writings of [[Nisargadatta Maharaj]], an Indian spiritual teacher and philosopher of [[Advaita]] ([[Nondualism]]), as well as [[Neem Karoli Baba]] and [[Ramana Maharshi]].

'''Holly Jo Glynn''' (September 11, 1966 – September 20, 1987)&lt;ref name=unsolvedupdate&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe|url=http://unsolved.com/archives/jane-doe|website=unsolved.com|publisher=''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]''|accessdate=June 19,  2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a formerly unidentified [[United States|American]] woman who is believed to have committed [[suicide]] in September 1987 by [[Jumper (person)|jumping off a cliff]] in [[Dana Point, California]]. Her body remained unidentified until 2015,&lt;ref name=uns15&gt;{{cite web|title=87-04457-EL|url=http://ocsd.org/divisions/prof/coroner/ud/jane/8704457el|website=OCSD.org|publisher=Orange County Sheriff Department|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=press/&gt; when concerns previously expressed by friends of Glynn that the unidentified woman may have been their childhood friend, whom they had been unable to locate for several years, were proven to be true.&lt;ref name=unsolved/&gt;

Prior to her May 2015 identification, Glynn's body had been informally known as the '''Dana Point Jane Doe''', and officially as '''Jane Doe 87-04457-EL'''&lt;ref name=uns15/&gt;

==Discovery==
At 6:40 on the morning of September 20, 1987, the body of a young [[White American|Caucasian]] woman was discovered by joggers at the base of a cliff at Dana Point, California. Her body had no form of identification on her possession, although at the top of the cliff, investigators discovered a half consumed can of Coca-Cola, a purse containing small change, a packet of cigarettes, matches, and two maps of [[Southern California]]. On the rear of one of these maps was written the telephone number of a local taxi firm in addition to other notations she had written, indicating she may have asked several individuals for directions.

===Distinguishing characteristics===
An examination of her remains indicated that death had occurred approximately two hours before her body was discovered, and that she was between 18 and 23 years old when she had died. She wore a tan dress, men's underwear and turquoise-colored canvas shoes, all of which were believed to have either been second-hand clothing or hand-me-downs.&lt;ref name=NCMEC/&gt;

[[File:Dana Point Jane Doe sketch.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Original [[forensic facial reconstruction|facial reconstruction]] of the Dana Point Jane Doe]]
The woman had been between {{height|ft=5|in=3|abbr=mos}} to {{height|ft=5|in=8|abbr=mos}} in height, and weighed {{convert|127|lb|kg}}. She had freckles, and her hair was [[strawberry-blond]] or light brown and long, reaching to the middle of her back. Her body had no distinctive tattoos, scarred tissue, or [[birthmark]]s, although she did have healed [[acne]] marks on her upper back and shoulder.&lt;ref name=doe/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCMEC&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1987|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1104264/1|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the woman had pierced ears, and had received several distinctive [[dental fillings]] in both her upper and lower jaw.&lt;ref name=CA&gt;{{cite web|title=Dana Point Jane Doe, CA|url=http://meyahna.tripod.com/pg15.html|website=meyahna.tripod.com|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further examination of her remains revealed she may have been pregnant or undergone a [[dilation and curettage]] procedure at one time during her life,&lt;ref name=unsolved/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCMEC/&gt; and may have also worn [[Dental braces|braces]] in her childhood or adolescence.&lt;ref name=CA&gt;{{cite web|title=Dana Point Jane Doe, CA|url=http://meyahna.tripod.com/pg15.html|website=meyahna.tripod.com|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eyewitness accounts==
Investigators contacted the taxi firm written on the map found at the top of the cliff from where the woman had either fallen or jumped to her death; they subsequently spoke with a driver who informed them he had provided transportation to a female who matched the description of the decedent&lt;ref name=press/&gt; sometime between 3 and 4 a.m. on September 20. The woman had asked to be picked up from a Unocal Station in [[Mission Viejo]] in southern [[Orange County, California|Orange County]],&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brazil|first1=Jeff|title=The Search for Names of the Dead: Orange County has a striking number of John and Jane Does who were neither poor nor loners. Many left clues--a room key, a bus ticket--that torment investigators trying to find out who they were.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-26/news/mn-50674_1_orange-county|accessdate=January 3, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 26, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; requesting to be driven to [[Laguna Beach, California|Laguna Beach]], or as far as the $18 she had in her possession would take her. According to the taxi driver, the woman had informed him that her car had broken down close to the gas station from where he had picked her up, but had otherwise been largely uncommunicative throughout the remainder of her journey in his taxi, although he did note she seemed very unhappy in demeanor.&lt;ref name=unsolved&gt;{{cite web|title=Did a woman fall to her death off a cliff or was she murdered?|url=http://www.unsolved-mystery.com/1742|website=unsolved.com|publisher=''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]''|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This driver further informed investigators he had dropped the young woman off at the Chart House near the intersection of Cove Road and Scenic Drive, and that he had last seen her walking in the direction of the cliff where her body had been found.&lt;ref name=NCMEC/&gt;&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

Before entering the taxi, the woman had earlier been seen at the Unocal Station in question, and had used the bathroom at the premises. Investigators would also discover that the woman had earlier entered a nearby [[Hampton by Hilton|Hampton Inn]] and asked a clerk if there were any "high end hotels" in the area.&lt;ref name=doe&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 23UFCA|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/23ufca.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further investigation===
From all evidence discovered at the scene of the death, investigators believed that the woman had climbed over a fence at the edge of the cliff and deliberately jumped to her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dana Point : Body of Young Woman Found in Dana Point|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-21/local/me-5908_1_dana-point|accessdate=October 14, 2014|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=September 21, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, her death was ruled a suicide. Nonetheless, other theories initially remained, including the possibility she may have been pushed from the cliff, or had accidentally fallen.&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{cite web|title=Identity Of Dana Point "Jane Doe" Still A Mystery Twenty-Five Years Later|url=http://letsfindthem.wordpress.com/2012/09/18/identity-of-dana-point-jane-doe-still-a-mystery-twenty-five-years-later-2/|website=letsfindthem.wordpress.com|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had initially survived the fall, and had moved somewhat before her death, leaving impressions similar to that of a [[snow angel]].&lt;ref name=one/&gt; The dead woman would colloquially become known in the press and other media as the Dana Point Jane Doe.

The purse in the Dana Point Jane Doe's possession was [[Paper embossing|embossed]] with a woman's name: Carol L. Pinkham. Authorities proceeded to trace all women who had this name; all of whom were found to be still alive. One of these women informed investigators that she had had a purse of this description stolen some 12 years earlier, in 1975.&lt;ref name=doe/&gt;&lt;ref name=CA/&gt;{{refn|group=n|Pinkham did not know who had committed the theft, and no person has ever been charged with this offense. No evidence exists as to how Glynn came into possession of this purse, or to her committing the theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Needham|first1=John|title=ID-ing the Dead : Bodies of John and Jane Does Trigger Special Concern Among 34 Members of Coroner's Office|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-17/news/li-996_1_deputy-coroner|accessdate=October 6, 2014|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=August 17, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In efforts to trigger recognition from those who may have seen the victim in life, a [[facial composite|composite drawing]] of the woman was created by a forensic artist from the Orange County Police Department.&lt;ref name=uns15/&gt; Despite these efforts the woman remained unidentified, and her death gradually became a [[cold case]].{{refn|group=n|The [[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] would later release a further rendering of Dana Point Jane Doe in 2014.&lt;ref name=NCMEC/&gt;}}

==Identification==
In May 2015, the Dana Point Jane Doe was formally identified as Holly Jo Glynn. This formal identification occurred after several high school friends of Holly's from [[Whittier, California|Whittier]], having been unable to regain contact with Holly via social media or any other conventional means of contact for several years, reported their suspicions to both the [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] (NamUs) and the [[Doe Network]] that the Dana Point Jane Doe may be Holly Jo Glynn. These efforts to determine whether the Dana Point Jane Doe may have been Holly Jo Glynn were first made in 2011.

In 2014, these friends contacted Facebook's "Help ID Me" page, again expressing their suspicions. These suspicions were subsequently relayed to authorities in early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.danapointtimes.com/its-history-murder-he-wrote/|title=It's History: Murder He Wrote|access-date=May 20, 2017|newspaper=Dana Point Times|date=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|The Facebook "Help ID Me" page is managed by the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children}}

The Orange County Sheriff's Department Coroner Division subsequently contacted surviving relatives of Holly Glynn and obtained [[DNA]] samples for formal comparison with the Dana Point Jane Doe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jbrwdi.forumotion.com/t581-is-dana-point-jane-doe-holly-glynn-of-whittier-elementary|title=Is Dana Point Jane Doe Holly Glynn of Whittier Elementary?|work=jbrwdi.forumotion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually announced by ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' that, via this technique of [[DNA profiling|DNA analysis]], the Dana Point Jane Doe had been Holly Jo Glynn.&lt;ref name=unsolvedupdate/&gt;&lt;ref name=uns15/&gt;

More than 20 years prior to her identification, Holly Jo Glynn's remains had been [[Cremation|cremated]] in a ceremony costing $425, paid for by Orange County on her behalf. Her ashes had then been placed in a cardboard box and buried at sea.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6170">'''Thomas Niedermayer''', [[Order of the British Empire|O.B.E.]] (1928–1973) was a German industrialist, who was kidnapped and died in the hands of the  [[Provisional IRA]] in 1973. He was managing director of the [[Grundig]] factory in [[Belfast]], and the [[West German]] honorary consul for [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/tragic-fate-of-the-niedermayers-a-sign-of-history-s-long-reach-1.1254117 Tragic fate of the Niedermayers a sign of history's long reach]. The Irish Times, 4 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abduction==
Niedermayer (45) was kidnapped on 27 December 1973, at around 11&amp;nbsp;pm from his home in [[Belfast|West Belfast]] by two IRA members who lured him outside his house on the pretext that they had accidentally crashed into his car. The abduction incident was witnessed by his two teenage daughters, who had answered the door to them, and by a neighbour who worked at the Grundig factory.

The [[Government of the United Kingdom]] denied at the time that it had received any subsequent demands from the IRA in relation to the kidnapping, but several years later it was revealed that it had done so, and had briefly attempted to negotiate with it, the IRA seeking the transferral from imprisonment in [[Great Britain]] to [[Northern Ireland|Ulster]] of two of its members who had been jailed for involvement in a bombing campaign in London in 1973. However the negotiations had ended abruptly from the IRA's side without explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/news-analysis/the-heavy-price-paid-by-the-tragic-niedermayers-29041586.html Belfast Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1980 the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], acting on information received, located Niedermayer's body lying face down, hands tied and gagged, in a shallow grave at an illegal rubbish dump at [[Colin Glen]]. A forensic examination revealed that the cause of death had been severe injuries sustained to the head after being [[pistol-whipping|pistol-whipped]] with a hand gun. A funeral for his body took place at [[Dunmurry]], where it was buried in the church's graveyard.&lt;ref&gt;'Three generations:fall-out from a forgotten IRA kidnapping', B.B.C. News, 15 February 2013. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-21469948&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal trial==
Eugene McManus (IRA Belfast Brigade Adjutant in 1973), and 42-year-old John Bradley (also an IRA member), were charged in connection with the crime. Bradley was originally charged with murder, but at his trial in 1981 he pleaded guilty to manslaughter, stating that he had accidentally killed Niedermayer whilst he was trying to escape. McManus pleaded guilty to withholding information about the crime and IRA membership. Bradley was subsequently sentenced to 20 years imprisonment, and McManus to 5 years imprisonment.

==Subsequent events==
Information later obtained by the Royal Ulster Constabulary revealed that the kidnapping operation had been set in motion by [[Brian Keenan (Irish republican)|Brian Keenan]], a former employee at the Belfast Grundig factory that Niedermayer had been the Director of, where Keenan, as a [[Trade Union]] representative, had had several confrontations with Niedermayer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/books/he-was-abducted-by-an-ira-gang-pistolwhipped-and-buried-face-down-so-that-he-could-only-dig-himself-in-deeper-28531381.html Belfast Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

Niedermayer's wife, Ingeborg, returned to Ireland 10 years to the day of her husband's funeral and booked into a hotel at [[Bray, County Wicklow]], where she committed suicide by walking into the sea from an isolated beach&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-21469948&lt;/ref&gt;. Niedermayer's two daughters, Gabrielle and Renate, both subsequently also committed suicide (respectively in 1991 and 1994). Gabrielle's husband, Robin Williams-Powell, killed himself 5 years later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/tragic-fate-of-the-niedermayers-a-sign-of-history-s-long-reach-1.1254117 Irish Times]&lt;/ref&gt; Gabrielle and Robin are survived by their two daughters, Tanya Williams-Powell and Rachel Robbins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.impalapublications.com/blog/index.php?/archives/4182-Niedermeyer,-by-James-OFee.html Niedermeyer, by James O'Fee], impalapublications.com, recovered 18 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toghrul III''' ({{lang-fa|طغرل سوم}}) (died 1194) was the last sultan of the [[Great Seljuq Empire]].

The son of sultan [[Arslan Shah]], he succeeded him in 1175 or 1176. In 1190 he tried to free himself from the tutelage of the Atabeg of Azerbaijan, [[Qizil Arslan]], but he was overthrown and imprisoned by the latter, who proclaimed himself sultan.&lt;ref&gt;Grousset, Rene, ''The Empire of the Steppes'', (Rutgers University Press, 1991), 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The usurper was assassinated the following year and Toghrul regained his throne. During his brief reign, Toghrul would become quite proficient in Persian poetry.&lt;ref&gt;A.C.S. Peacock, ''The Great Seljuk Empire'', (Edinburgh University Press, 2015), 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 1194, he was defeated and killed near [[Rey, Iran|Rey]]&lt;ref&gt;Grousset, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; in the war that he had waged against the Shah of Khwarezm, [[Ala ad-Din Tekish]]. Toghrul's head was sent to the Caliph [[An-Nasir (Abbasid Caliph)|Al-Nasir]] who displayed it in front of his palace in Baghdad. The Great Seljuq Empire disappeared with Toghrul's death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5089">A '''vulvar disease''' is a particular abnormal, pathological condition that affects part or all of the [[vulva]]. Several [[pathology|pathologies]] are defined. Some can be prevented by [[vulvovaginal health maintenance]].

==Vulvar cancer==
{{Main|Vulvar cancer}}
''Vulvar [[cancer]]'' accounts for about 5% of all gynecological cancers and typically affects women in later life. [[Five year survival rates]] in the United States are around 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEER Stat Fact Sheets: Vulvar Cancer|url=http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/vulva.html|website=NCI|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms of vulvar cancer include itching, a lump or sore on the vulva which does not heal and/or grows larger, and sometimes discomfort/pain/swelling in the vulval area. Treatments include [[vulvectomy]] – removal of all or part of the vulva.

==Vulvo-perineal localization of dermatologic disorders==

'''William Jefferson Blythe Jr.''' (February 27, 1918&amp;nbsp;– May 17, 1946) was an [[Arkansas]] salesman of heavy equipment and the father of [[Bill Clinton]], the [[List of Presidents of the United States|42nd]] [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/21/us/clinton-reported-to-have-a-brother-he-never-met.html?pagewanted=1 | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Clinton Reported to Have A Brother He Never Met | first=Edmund L. | last=Andrews | date=June 21, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blythe died three months before his son was born.

==Personal life==
William Jefferon Blythe Jr. was born as one of nine children to William Jefferson Blythe Sr. (1884–1935), a farmer in [[Sherman, Texas]], and his wife, the former Lou Birchie Ayers (1893–1946).  He was of [[English Americans|English]] and [[Scottish Americans|Scots]] descent, with family lines in North America since the days of the thirteen colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wargs.com/political/clinton.html "The Ancestors of President Bill Clinton (b. 1946)"], by William Addams Reitwiesner stating : "The following material on the immediate ancestry of Bill Clinton is taken almost verbatim from Gary Boyd Roberts, ''Ancestors of American Presidents'', First Authoritative Edition. Santa Clarita, Cal.: Boyer, 1995."&lt;/ref&gt;

Blythe was married four times. He married for the first time in December 1935 to Virginia Adele Gash; they were divorced only thirteen months later. Although no child was born to the couple during their marriage, they later had a son together. After the divorce, Virginia moved to California and married first a man named Coffelt, then a man named Charles Ritzenthaler. However, she and Blythe remained friends, and she visited him on occasion. A son was conceived during these visits, and Henry Leon Blythe was born in [[Sherman, Texas]] on June 17, 1938, some eighteen months after his parents had been divorced. Henry's parents lost touch with each other when he was an infant, after his father briefly married and divorced his mother's sister, and he never knew his biological father or paternal siblings. Later in life, Henry Leon Blythe took the name Henry Leon Ritzenthaler in honor of a step-father. He ran several small businesses in [[Paradise, California]], including a janitorial business, and died in 2009. He was unaware of his connection to the future president until the presidential campaign of 1992, when an investigation by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', based on birth registry records, revealed details of Bill Clinton's family. Ritzenthaler met his half-brother for the first time around that time, and the physical resemblance between them was remarked upon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/22/us/clinton-s-lost-half-brother-to-neighbors-he-s-just-leon.html Henry Leon Ritzenthaler, 1938-2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Blythe next married Minnie Faye Gash, his first wife's sister, in December 1940. The marriage was annulled only four months later, in April 1941, and there were no children. Shortly after the annulment, on May 3, 1941, Blythe married again. His third wife was Wanetta Ellen Alexander of [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and the wedding was held in [[Jackson County, Missouri]]. Wanetta gave birth to Blythe's daughter on May 11, 1941, eight days after their wedding. She had become pregnant with Blythe's child prior to his short-lived second marriage to Minnie. Sharon Lee Blythe Pettijohn is the daughter of Wanetta and Blythe, and is still alive in 2016. Blythe and Wanetta were formally divorced three years later, in April 1944. They lost touch immediately afterwards; Wanetta, who eventually settled in [[Tucson, Arizona]], had no inkling of Blythe's subsequent history until the presidential campaign of 1992 and the ''Washington Post'' story. Upon seeing old photographs of Bill Clinton's father flashed on TV, Wanetta "swears on a stack of Bibles&amp;nbsp;... that that was the man she was married to", said her son-in-law Bob Pettijohn, husband of her daughter Sharon.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Blythe's divorce from Wanetta Alexander was granted in court on April 13, 1944. Seven months before that, on September 4, 1943, Blythe had bigamously "married" Virginia Dell Cassidy of [[Bodcaw, Arkansas]]. Blythe and Cassidy remained married until his death in a car crash on May 17, 1946. Three months after Blythe's death, on August 19, 1946, Cassidy gave birth to their only child, William Jefferson Blythe III, who as a teen took his stepfather's surname and became known as [[Bill Clinton]], the future [[List of Presidents of the United States|42nd]] [[President of the United States]]. Cassidy had no knowledge of Blythe's previous marriages until decades later when ''The Washington Post'' ran an extensive story in 1993, based on birth and marriage registry records, to mark Father's Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DB1F3FF932A15755C0A965958260|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 21, 1993|first=Edmund|last=Andrews|title= Clinton Reported to Have A Brother He Never Met}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDC103AF931A15755C0A965958260|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|first=Jane|last=Gross|title=Clinton's Lost Half-Brother? To Neighbors, He's Just Leon|date=June 22, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Blythe was a traveling heavy equipment salesman for most of his brief career.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov bio"&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography of William J. Clinton |publisher=[[White House]] |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/williamjclinton/ |accessdate=August 30, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722104326/http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/williamjclinton/ |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was while he worked as a travelling salesman that he met and married all his four wives. Some time after his fourth wedding, which happened in September 1943, Blythe shipped out for military service during [[World War II]]. He was stationed in [[Egypt]] and [[Italy]]. He worked in a motor pool, repairing jeeps and tanks. 

After the war ended, Blythe returned to [[Hope, Arkansas]] to be with his wife. Shortly after he returned, he purchased a house in [[Chicago]] and readied it to receive his wife and expected child; he was apparently laying the ground for a more settled and conventional married life. Blythe moved to the new house in Chicago while Virginia remained behind in Hope. In Chicago, Blythe returned to his old job as a traveling salesman for the Manbee Equipment Company, which repaired heavy machinery. He died three months before the birth of his son.

==Death==
On May 17, 1946, while traveling from [[Chicago, Illinois]], to Hope, Arkansas, Blythe lost control of his 1942 [[Buick]] on [[U.S. Route 60]] outside of [[Sikeston, Missouri]], after one of his car's tires blew out. He survived the accident after being thrown from the car, but drowned in a drainage ditch as he tried to pull his way out of the three feet (1 meter) of water in the ditch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/candidates/democrat/clinton/clinton.family.shtml|publisher=[[CNN]]|title=The Clinton Family Bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, Blythe's widow, Virginia, gave birth to their son, whom she named [[Bill Clinton|William Jefferson Blythe III]] in honor of his father and grandfather. In 1950, Blythe's widow married [[Roger Clinton Sr.]]; 12 years later, Blythe's posthumous son legally adopted his stepfather's surname.

==Memorial==
Blythe was buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Hope, [[Hempstead County, Arkansas]]. In 1994, Virginia was interred beside him. In Clinton's 2004 autobiography, ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'', the elder Blythe was extensively mentioned, including a visit that Clinton made to the site where his father drowned.
