      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39939">The history of [[African American]] women and their participation in the [[birth control]] movement reflects a very conflicted set of ideals regarding African American women, the use of [[contraceptive]] practices and [[abortion]]. Prominent historical figures debated whether African American communities would benefit from birth control or if birth control was another methodical scheme put in place to suppress the African American community.

== Early uses of birth control during slavery ==
During slavery times in the United States, black slave women were viewed as "breeding slaves" and "child bearing women"—simply vessels to meet the demands for labor in Southern agricultural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slavery and Rice Culture in Low Country Georgia, 1750–1860|last=Smith|first=Julia Floyd|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through arranged marriages and forced mating with other slaves along with direct rape from slave owners, slave women were subject to frequent sexual exploitation. The women were even blamed for these phenomena as white male masters developed the "Jezebel" stereotype of black women as passionate, hypersexual beings who wanted to engage in sexual acts with anyone and everyone.&lt;ref name="Undivided Rights" /&gt;

In resistance to slavery and specifically sexual oppression, black slave women often resorted to their own forms of abortion and contraception. Southern physician E. M. Pendleton reported that plantation owners frequently complained about "the unnatural tendency in the African female population to destroy her offspring. Whole families of women&amp;nbsp;... fail to have any children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hine Sight: Black Women and the Re-construction of American History|last=Hine|first=Darlene Clark|publisher=UP|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women drew upon African folk remedies to concoct medicines that would be shared and spread throughout the slave women community.

== The beginnings of organization ==
After the slavery era, black women mobilized in a variety of African American women's clubs across the nation to exercise their beliefs within a political platform. Prominent African American women leaders such as [[Harriet Tubman]], [[Frances Harper|Frances E.W. Harper]], [[Ida B. Wells|Ida Bell Wells-Barnett]], and [[Mary Church Terrell]] led the founding of the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs]]. As issues of racism, segregation and discrimination perpetrated life for African Americans in post-slavery America, the NACWC and its 1,500 affiliate clubs worked to promote "racial uplift with the motto of "Lifting as We Climb," aspiring to show "an ignorant and suspicious world that our aims and interests are identical with those of all good aspiring women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Association-of-Colored-Womens-Clubs|title=National Association of Colored Women's Clubs (NACWC) {{!}} American organization|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with fundraising to establish schools and community services, the NACWC endorsed the movement for birth control as part of its agenda to empower black women and help them achieve better lives.&lt;ref name="Undivided Rights" /&gt;

The black community of Harlem was particularly interested in birth control for women, and in 1918, the Women's Political Association of Harlem was the first African American women's club to schedule lectures on birth control.&lt;ref name="Undivided Rights" /&gt; Their efforts continued with the Harlem Community Forum inviting [[Margaret Sanger]] to speak in March 1923 and the Urban League asking the [[American Birth Control League]] to establish a birth control clinic in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Health in America: Historical Readings|last=Leavitt|first=Judith Walzer|publisher=U of Wisconsin|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, Sanger attempted to open a nearby clinic in the largely black Columbus Hill area, but the clinic only ran for three months before closing because of low attendance. Some reasons for the low patient turnout could have been because many African Americans were transitioning out of the neighborhood or because of lack of engagement with community leaders. Despite this initial failure, Sanger continued to push for more clinics in struggling areas. In 1932, she opened a successful clinic in Harlem with the support from black churches in Harlem as well as an all-black Advisory Council. Black ministers of Harlem churches spoke at public meetings and used the churches as spaces for educational lectures. The Harlem clinic's patient clientele was about half black and half white, and in the first year and a half, almost 3,000 people visited the clinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/articles/harlem.php|title="Looking Uptown: Margaret Sanger and the Harlem Branch Birth Control Clinic"|last=|first=|date=|website=The Margaret Sanger Papers Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more black women's clubs were established and as more black women participated in these organized clubs, more black women became aware of birth control methods and information.

==Early arguments for contraception for African Americans==
[[File:Harriet Tubman.jpg|thumb|Harriet Tubman]]
In July 1932, [[Margaret Sanger]] published a special issue of her magazine entitled the [[Birth Control Review]]. The issue was titled the ''Negro Number'' and called on prominent African Americans to display why birth control was beneficial to the African American community. Authors such as [[W.E.B Du Bois]] and [[George Schuyler]] contributed to the magazine stating different reasons why they believed contraception was an asset for Blacks&lt;ref name="test"&gt;DuBois, W. (2011). Black Folk and Birth Control. In H. L. Gates, &amp; J. Burton, Call and Response (pp. 497-498). New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mary church terrell.jpg|thumb|Mary Church Terrell]]
DuBois addressed the issue of birth control as a means of empowerment for African Americans in the article ''Black Folk and Birth Control''. DuBois believed that voluntary birth control could serve as a way for Blacks to plan their families and secure their economic futures by not producing more children than the family could afford. He also addressed the issue of African Americans and the belief that in order to gain a substantial amount of power, Blacks need to produce more offspring. DuBois stated, "They must learn that among human races and groups, as among vegetables, quality and not mere quantity counts."&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;
[[File:Angela Davis Moscow 1972 cropped.jpg|thumb|Angela Davis]]
George S. Schuyler based his entire article on the idea that the viability of Black offspring was more important than the overall number of children produced. Schuyler's article, Quantity or Quality, was a critique of the idea that sheer numbers, in terms of offspring, could bring African Americans the power and equality that they were working toward. Schuyler argued that the health of the Black family, and most specifically health of the black woman, should be the focus of the birth control debate. The article made it clear that if Black women were able to plan their pregnancies, then there would be a chance that the infant mortality rates would decrease. Schuyler observed, "If twenty-five percent of the brown children born die at birth or in infancy because of the unhealthful and poverty-stricken conditions of the mothers and twenty-five percent more die in youth or vegetate in jails and asylums, there is instead of a gain a distinct loss."&lt;ref&gt;Schuyler, G. (2011). Quantity or Quality. In H. L. Gates, &amp; J. Burton, Call and Response (pp. 498-499). New York: W.W. Norton and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early opposition==

Contraception was not unilaterally accepted in the African American community during the early 20th century. Birth control to some seemed like a method of population control that could be administered by the government to suppress the Black population. [[Marcus Garvey]] and Julian Lewis were both against birth control for African Americans for this reason though the approach differed. Garvey, as a Black Nationalist, believed in the "power in numbers" theory when it came to how Blacks would obtain power in the U.S. Garvey was also a Roman Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Gleaner. (2011). Marcus Garvey on Birth Control. In H. L. Gates, &amp; J. Burton, Call and Response (pp. 502-503). New York: W.W. Norton and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis took a more "scientific" approach to denouncing contraception.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, J. (2011). Can the Negro Afford Birth Control. In H. L. Gates, &amp; J. Burton, Call and Response (pp. 504-505). 2011: W.W. Norton and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The abortion debate==
In the African American community, abortion has been a highly contested topic, arguably for slightly different reasons than the reasons argued by mainstream society. Abortion and other forms of birth control have been stigmatized among African Americans because of the historical involuntary sterilizations that were performed on many African American women during the 20th century. "If ever women would enjoy the right to plan their pregnancies, legal and accessible birth control measures and abortions would have to be complemented by an end to sterilization abuse."&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;Davis, A. Y. (1983). Women, Race and Class. New York City: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar and activist [[Angela Davis]] argued that African American women are not pro-abortion but believe in abortion rights. The impact of slavery has influenced this ideology that abortions are not morally right, but performed in acts of desperation. "Abortions and infanticides were acts of desperation, motivated not by the biological birth process but by the oppressive conditions of slavery."&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt; Impoverished African American women were another example provided by Davis for the experience of desperate conditions that could lead her to abort.

[[Shirley Chisholm]] spoke to the debate from a political perspective in 1970. Chisholm described the decriminalization  of abortions as a necessary step toward the safety of women. "Experience shows that pregnant women who feel that they have compelling reasons for not having a baby, or another baby, will break the law and even worse, risk injury or death if they must get one. Abortions will not be stopped."&lt;ref name="shirley"&gt;Chisholm, S. (2011). Facing the Abortion Question. In H. L. Gates, &amp; J. Burton, Call and Response (pp. 787-791). New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of black nationalist parties ==

=== Background ===
Black nationalist parties in the late 1960s and early 1970s tended to view the use of contraceptives in black populations was at best, an ill-conceived public health measure, and at worst a front for a conspiracy of black genocide. For the most part, male-dominated black nationalists were opposed to the promotion of personal fertility control and protested against government funded family planners who they viewed to be putting forth an agenda of black population control.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Much of the opposition to fertility control was sparked by the sterilization of Minnie Lee and Mary Alice in 1973. The sisters received federally funded birth control grants from the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] (OEO). At the Montgomery Family Planning Clinic, Minnie Lee and Mary Alice, fourteen and seventeen years old at the time respectively, both underwent surgical sterilization without informed consent. Mrs. Relf, their mother was unable to read and was coerced into signing parental consent forms without being able to understand the documents. Additionally, both sisters were forced by clinic staff to sign false documents indicating that they were over twenty-one. The family later filed a complaint through the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] citing that the treatment of the sisters at the clinic was abusive and coercive because 1) neither the mother nor her daughters gave any indication of wanting to undergo surgical sterilization, 2) neither mother nor daughters met with the physician who would perform the operation before the fact, and 3) neither mother nor daughters received information about the consequences of tubal sterilization from a physician or member of the clinic staff. The Relf case prompted many other African American, Native American, and Latina women to come forth with similar stories of coercion. In light of this case, many black nationalist groups came to conflate any birth control movement with a larger conspiracy of black population control.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.racismreview.com/blog/2007/09/22/sterilization-and-women-of-color/|title=Sterilization and Women of Color -|date=2007-09-22|access-date=2017-03-27|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most vocal of these black nationalist groups were the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]] and the [[Nation of Islam]]. These two organizations argued that white government family planners posed a threat to the black population by offering them birth control without other health care measures, namely, preventive medicine and hospitals, pre- and postnatal care, nutritional advice, and dentistry. They argued that birth control services remained harmful without adequate solutions to health care problems related to poverty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Additionally, other black groups and black scholars vocally criticized the targeting of poor black communities as centers for population control. Ron Walters, chairman of the department of political science at [[Howard University]], a historically black university, was one of the most outspoken critics of population control aimed at black families. He advocated that black communities ought to be responsible for defining their own fertility programs and birth control policies. Members of the [[National Urban League|Urban League]], [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], likewise criticized birth control programs throughout the 1960s. A particular point of contention was the lack of minority representation in [[Planned Parenthood]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

However, as the feminist message of the right to abortion and birth control began to become more widespread and as black feminists became more vocal in advocating for birth control access, the views of many Black Nationalist parties began to adapt. By the mid-1970s, the federal government had reduced funding for fertility control and family planning programs were viewed as less favorable after Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court abortion case. Additionally, vocal criticism of federal family planning programs lead the government to refashion their rhetoric to be less targeted towards poor black communities. Given this context, groups such as the Black Panther's expanded their emphasis on total health care to include birth control and abortion when voluntarily chosen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The role of the Black Panther Party ===
The Black Panther Party was founded in Oakland in 1966 as a black power group with a revolutionary black nationalist and socialist agenda. Upon its inception, the Black Panthers as an organization rejected all forms of reproductive control claiming that governmentally regulated reproductive control was genocidal for blacks. The Black Panthers, and the [[Black Liberation Army]], the military wing of the party, believed that an armed black revolution against white supremacy was possible. They were quick to believe that targeted birth control was part of a governmental plot to reduce the number of blacks in America in order to prevent an armed revolt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This suspicious view of birth control was to change throughout the 1970s. In 1971, women in the party vocally pushed back against an anti-birth control position on the basis that large families are difficult to support. They argued that it would be difficult for both men and women to participate politically due to the burden of supporting large families. In 1974, [[Elaine Brown]] took over leadership of the party following the exile of founding member [[Huey P. Newton|Huey Newton]]. With a woman in power, women's voices gained prominence in the party. Women also came to be more of a presence in the party as a result of the FBI's crackdown in the Black Power movement in the 1970s which resulted in the arrests and deaths of many male party leaders.

Brown actively placed other female members in leadership positions despite push back from male members of the party. However, masculine leadership was reasserted in the party upon Newton's return to the United States in 1976. That being said, Brown's tenure as leader of the party from 1974 to 1976 significantly changed the party's stance on birth control policies and other feminist causes. In particular, the party educated black women on the dangers of forced sterilization and published articles on documented cases of coerced sterilization by the state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In an article published by the Committee to End Sterilization Abuse, the Black Panthers asserted that as high as 20% of black women in the United States had been sterilized. Additionally, the party shifted their rhetoric to emphasize the importance of health care and legal abortion in black communities. Despite their anti-birth control views in the 1960s, in later decades, the party adopted birth control and abortion rhetoric that later played into the reproductive rights movement.

=== The role of the Nation of Islam ===
The Nation of Islam, a black political and religious movement founded in the 1930s were among the first to claim fertility control as a form of genocide in the black community in the 1960s. The group was quick to draw parallels between what they saw as genocidal population control in the United States to population control policies in third world countries. By and large, the rhetoric put forth by the Nation of Islam was viewed by many as alienating and excessively conspiratorial. While the Nation of Islam maintained a more hardline approach to birth control and abortion, they too shifted their rhetoric to push for expanded health care for black communities and greater structural solutions to health problems linked to poverty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== The sterilization movement ==

=== Early laws and influences from the eugenics movement ===
Widespread practices of female sterilization began in the early 1900s. Throughout the 20th century, a majority of states passed laws allowing sterilization, and even requiring it in prescribed circumstances. The first sterilization statutes were passed in Indiana in 1907, and the last was passed in Georgia in 1970.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mn.gov/mnddc/honoring-choices/cnnReports/Moral_and_Ethical_Issues-Kappel.pdf|title=Sterilization|last=Kappel|first=Bruce|date=October 2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sterilization law passed the state of Indiana in 1907 allowed the "prevention of the procreation of, confirmed criminals, idiots, imbeciles, and rapists." The Supreme Court of Indiana declared this statute unconstitutional for a short time in 1921; however but a similar law passed in 1927 was ruled constitutional. In the next fifty years, laws resembling Indiana's sterilization statute were passed in 30 different states. These policies legalized forced sterilization for certain groups, based on race and class lines, many of which were already marginalized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

As early scientific genetic theories were emerging, [[eugenics]] (and thus sterilization) became an accepted way of protecting society from the offspring of those individuals deemed lesser than or dangerous to society – the poor, the disabled, the mentally ill, and particularly, people of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/unwanted-sterilization-and-eugenics-programs-in-the-united-states/|title=Unwanted Sterilization and Eugenics Programs in the United States {{!}} No Más Bebés {{!}} Independent Lens {{!}} PBS|work=Independent Lens|access-date=2017-03-27|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several states, most notably North Carolina, even went so far as to set up Eugenics Boards during this time period. These boards reviewed petitions from government and private agencies to perform sterilizations on poor, unwed, disabled women.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/health-info/forced-sterilization/|title=History of Forced Sterilization and Current U.S. Abuses - Our Bodies Ourselves|work=Our Bodies Ourselves|access-date=2017-03-27|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular form of female sterilization was [[tubal ligation]], a surgical procedure that severs or seals a woman's fallopian tubes, permanently preventing her from conceiving a child. In most cases, medical providers did not have to ask for the women's consent before performing the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartz|first=Deborah|last2=Greenberg|first2=James A|date=2008-01-01|title=Sterilization in the United States|journal=Reviews in Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=1|issue=1|pages=23–32|issn=1941-2797| pmc=2492586 |pmid=18701927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court case [[Buck v. Bell]] (1927) was a landmark case that upheld a state's right to forcibly sterilize a person considered unfit to procreate. The plaintiff, a young woman named Carrie Bell, was the first person to have been sterilized without consent under Virginia's new sterilization statute. Bell had been sterilized because her mother had been involuntarily institutionalized for being "feebleminded" and "promiscuous." Upon learning her family history, doctors assumed that Bell had inherited those same traits and saw her as unfit to procreate. After giving birth to her first child, Bell was forcibly sterilized.

=== Practices during the 1960s and 1970s ===
Sterilization abuse of African American women inflicted by the American government and white medical establishments reached its height in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pill/peopleevents/e_genocide.html|title=American Experience {{!}} The Pill {{!}} People &amp; Events|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coinciding with the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]], a time period in which the black community was beginning to gain political autonomy, the government tried restrict blacks' freedom through another channel—preventing black women from becoming mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/Legacy/Views/static/html/Error.htm?aspxerrorpath=/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer|title=HarvardKey Login|website=web.b.ebscohost.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, black women were sterilized at over twice the rate of white women: 9 per 1,000 for black women as compared to 4.1 per 1,000 for white women. A second survey taken in 1973 indicated that 43% of women who underwent sterilization in federally financed family planning programs were also black. The intersection between race and low-income status made black women even more vulnerable to forced sterilization. Many of these black women were poor and could only rely on federally subsidized clinics or Medicaid for health care. Some women had experienced sterilization without consent after a doctor had agreed to perform an illegal abortion; others were pressured into allowing sterilization after receiving a legal hospital abortion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The patterns were even worse for non-married black women; in 1978, the tubal sterilization rate for never-married black women was 529 percent greater than that of their white counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/plink?key=10.81.11.197_8000_1143046053&amp;bquery=(sterilization)+AND+(black+women)&amp;db=aph&amp;cli0=FT&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|title=HarvardKey Login|website=web.b.ebscohost.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s, punitive sterilization laws were proposed in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. The purpose of such laws was to reduce the number of children born to poor, unmarried mothers. Many of these laws contained statutes that withheld welfare benefits from women with illegitimate children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As intended, these laws disproportionately affected women of color, particularly African American mothers. According to the ACLU, the Eugenics Board of North Carolina approved 1,620 sterilizations between the years 1960 and 1968. Of that number, 1023 were performed on black women and nearly 56 percent of those were performed on black women under 20 years of age.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Aside from government actions, abuses of power also took place in the American medical establishment. One of the most infamous examples of such abuses was the actions of South Carolina physician, Dr. Clovis Pierce. After accepting federal money to perform the sterilizations of 18 [[Medicaid]] patients in his clinic, he told women that he would only deliver their third pregnancy on the condition that they would submit to sterilization immediately afterwards. Pierce was able to defend himself against all lawsuits that were brought against him. Furthermore, the South Carolina State branch of the American Medical Association (AMA) unanimously supported Pierce's actions against all of the women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Relf v. Weinberger ===
{{main|The Relf Sisters}}
In 1973, one particular case brought attention to the issue of forced sterilization. Twelve-year-old Minnie Lee Relf was sterilized without her consent or consent of a parent in a federally funded [[Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) health clinic—the Montgomery Family Planning Clinic—in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. The official plaintiff was Katie Relf, the sister of Minnie Lee, and the defendant was [[Caspar Weinberger]], Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare.&lt;ref name="Relf v. Weinberger"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/seeking-justice/case-docket/relf-v-weinberger|title=Relf v. Weinberger|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crux of the case challenged a state eugenics statute that authorized the procedure for "mentally incompetent" individuals without requiring the girl's consent or that of a guardian. Caseworkers had diagnosed Minnie Lee as mentally retarded and thus were able to apply the statute, although the basis for their diagnosis was extremely questionable. As a result both Minnie Lee and her sister Mary Alice received tubal ligations without their consent. Their mother (who was illiterate) unknowingly authorized the procedure by signing an "X", under the false impression that her daughters were being receiving routine birth control injections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The District Court initially decided in favor of the Relf sisters; its decision declared certain HEW regulations covering sterilizations to be "arbitrary and unreasonable" and prohibited HEW from providing federal funds to be used for the sterilization of "certain incompetent persons". The District Court also ordered HEW to amend its overall regulations. During the course of the litigation, HEW was able to withdraw the challenged regulations. Upon appeal, the Court of Appeals held that the case was now rendered inconsequential by HEW's revisionary actions and remanded the case back to the District Court for dismissal.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Anti-sterilization efforts ==
The issue of forced sterilization came to the forefront of activists' and scholars' minds in the 1960s and '70s when evidence of widespread sterilization abuse on women of color was uncovered. Disproportionate numbers of black women, among other minority groups like Puerto Ricans and Native Americans, were receiving sterilizations, and many were completed in federally-funded clinics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Undivided Rights: Women of Color Organize for Reproductive Justice|last=Silliman, Jael Miriam, Marlene Gerber Fried, Loretta Ross, and Elena R. Gutierrez|first=|publisher=Haymarket|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, 32 states had federally-funded sterilization programs in place.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women of the Color and the Reproductive Rights Movement|last=Nelson|first=Jennifer|publisher=New York University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-sterilization efforts in the 1970s came as the result of several high-profile sterilization abuse scandals. In 1972, President Nixon failed to enact a "set of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) sterilization guidelines" that would have prevented women from undergoing "forced or coerced sterilization in federally subsidized clinics."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This failure was exposed in 1973, when it became known that Mary Alice and Minnie Lee Relf, of Relf v. Weinberger, had undergone sterilizations without their consent at a federally-funded clinic in Alabama.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It was later revealed that between 100,000 and 150,000 poor women, mostly of color, had been sterilized using federal dollars.&lt;ref name="Relf v. Weinberger"/&gt; Regulations were quickly put in place after the National Welfare Rights Organization sued HEW in 1974. These regulations "prohibited the sterilization of anyone less than 21 years of age, required a 72-hour waiting period, and protected a woman from losing her Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) support if she did not agree to sterilization." HEW, however, then created a program through which states were reimbursed for sterilizations of poor women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Committee to End Sterilization Abuse (CESA) was founded in 1974 to combat the abuse of sterilization on women of color. It had a strong "anti-imperialist orientation" that attracted a multiracial membership, including white, Puerto Rican, and black women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1975, a coalition of groups formed "an umbrella anti-sterilization abuse organization" called the Advisory Committee on Sterilization. Members of the coalition included CESA and the [[National Black Feminist Organization]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; a group committed to addressing the double burden of racism and sexism faced by black women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/national-black-feminist-organization-1973-1976|title=National Black Feminist Organization (1973-1976) {{!}} The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|website=www.blackpast.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition formed to advise the [[NYC Health + Hospitals|New York City Health and Hospital's Corporation]] (HHC) on how to prevent forced or coerced sterilization within municipal hospitals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Advisory Committee created a set of guidelines that mandated a 30-day waiting period and required "that consent not be given at the time of abortion or childbirth; that there be counseling on other fertility control options; that information on sterilization be given in the patient's native language; that the idea for sterilization must originate with the patient; that women could bring a patient advocate and another person of their choosing to accompany them through the process; and that the patient present written understanding of sterilization with an emphasis on its permanence."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1975, these guidelines were passed by HHC and enforced within municipal New York City hospitals, and in a 1977 City Council vote they were extended to all NYC hospitals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, in 1978, the Nadler bill, named for state assemblyman [[Jerrold Nadler]], was passed in the New York state legislature which outlined a set of sterilization regulations similar to the original ones passed by the HHC.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

CESA disbanded after the passage of the Nadler bill, and with the HEW sterilization regulations in place, anti-sterilization efforts took the back burner for many feminist activists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2013, North Carolina became the first state to compensate its victims of forced sterilization with a payment of $50,000.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0306-bold-forced-sterilization-compensation-20150306-story.html|title=It's time for California to compensate its forced-sterilization victims|date=2015-03-05|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-03-27|language=English|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North Carolina, 7,600 people were sterilized between 1929 and 1974, 85% of them female and 40% of them nonwhite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rockcenter.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/11/07/8640744-victims-speak-out-about-north-carolina-sterilization-program-which-targeted-women-young-girls-and-blacks|title=Victims speak out about North Carolina sterilization program, which targeted women, young girls and blacks|last=Williams|first=Rock Center with Brian|work=NBC News|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia became the second state to provide payments in 2015, giving each living victim $25,000.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Contemporary groups that continue to address sterilization within the black community include [[Incite!]] and SisterSong.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Incite! is a "national, activist organization of radical feminists of color…[dedicated to] end[ing] all forms of violence against women, gender non-conforming, and trans people of color and our communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.incite-national.org/page/vision|title=Vision {{!}} incite-national.org|website=www.incite-national.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that women, transgender, and gender nonconforming individuals live at "dangerous intersections" and are subjected to institutional violence, including sterilization abuse. SisterSong is committed to "Reproductive Justice," which they define as "the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sistersong.net/reproductive-justice/|title=Reproductive Justice - Sister Song, Inc|work=Sister Song, Inc|access-date=2017-03-27|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==
Women of color, frustrated by not having their issues heard by the mainstream white-led reproductive rights organizations, founded their own organizations such as the National Black Women's Health Project and African American Women Evolving directly addressing their specific needs.

=== National Black Women's Health Project (NBWHP) ===
The first National Conference on Black Women's Health Issues was held at [[Spelman College]] in 1983 and gave birth to the [[Black Women’s Health Imperative|National Black Women's Health Project (NBWHP)]] with the intent of bringing African American women's voices on health and reproductive rights to national and international attention.

Founded by health care activist [[Byllye Avery]] and incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 1984, the NBWHP was the first women of color reproductive justice organization.&lt;ref name="Undivided Rights" /&gt; The organization later changed its name in 2003 to Black Women's Health Imperative "to reinforce the need to move beyond merely documenting the health inequities that exist for Black women and to focus on actionable steps to eliminate them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bwhi.org/who/who-we-are/|title=Black Women's Health Imperative|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byllye Avery worked in children's and women's health care in a hospital in Gainesville, Florida and joined the board of directors of the National Women's Health Network (NWHN) which informed her organizing the 1983 National Conference on Black Women's Health Issues.

Lillie Allen, a health educator concerned with reproductive health education and internalized racism, co-founded the NBWHP. She was the Rockefeller Fellow in Population at [[Morehouse School of Medicine]] in Atlanta in 1983 and part of the planning committee for the 1983 National Conference on Black Women's Health Issues.

Based in Atlanta, Georgia, the NBWHP had established chapters in 22 states by the end of 1989 and popularized its message through a network of conferences and workshops, and by publishing a magazine, manuals and educational videos. The NBWHP participated in the 1985 United Nations World Conference for Women in Nairobi, Kenya. In 1990, NBWHP opened a public policy-based office in Washington, D.C. to more actively promote public policies to improve black women's health, such as advising [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]]'s pro-choice administration's health policies and regulation. By then, the NBWHP had moved from being a grassroots organization to advertising black women's health through public policy on a national stage.

=== African American Women Evolving (AAWE) ===
African American Women Evolving (AAWE) started as a project within the [[Chicago Abortion Fund]], a predominantly white [[pro-choice]] organization, in Chicago in 1996. AAWE was committed to holistic community health education and promoting a black women's health agenda within a primarily white-led organization. After organizing Chicago's first conference on black women's health, AAWE became an independent organization in 1999 incorporating under the National Network of Abortion Funds. The organization later changed its name to Black Women for Reproductive Justice (BWRJ).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bwrj.wordpress.com/category/becoming-aawe/|title=Black Women For Reproductive Justice (BWRJ)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; BWRJ conducted several surveys gathering data on African American women's reproductive health and making that data publicly available. As a predominantly grassroots and [[pro-choice]] organization, BWRJ emphasized making health care information and options available to African American women in the Chicago area and Illinois. The organization also worked on policy recommendations, and advised, inter alia, the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America|National Abortion Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL)]].&lt;ref name="Undivided Rights" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5504">The '''American College of Radiology (ACR)''', founded in 1923, is a professional medical society representing more than 38,000 diagnostic radiologists, radiation oncologists, interventional radiologists, nuclear medicine physicians and medical physicists. The ACR is centered on six core functional areas: membership value, quality and safety, advocacy, economics, research, and education.

The ACR currently has 54 chapters — one from all 50 states, DC, Canada, Puerto Rico and the Council of Affiliated Regional Radiation Oncology Societies (CARROS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acr.org/Member-Resources/ACR-Chapters|title=ACR Chapters|website=www.acr.org|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical Imaging Accreditation==
Since 1987, the College has accredited more than 39,000 medical imaging facilities in 10 imaging modalities, including:

# Breast MRI
# Breast Ultrasound
# Computed Tomography
# Mammography
# Magnetic Resonance Imaging
# Nuclear Medicine 
# Positron Emission Tomography
# Radiation Oncology Practice
# Stereotactic Breast Biopsy
# Ultrasound

==Appropriateness Criteria==
The ACR Appropriateness Criteria® (ACR AC) are evidence-based guidelines that assist referring physicians and other providers in making the most appropriate imaging or treatment decision for a specific clinical condition. The guidelines were created to help providers enhance quality of care and contribute to the most efficacious use of radiology. The ACR AC includes 178 diagnostic imaging and interventional radiology topics with 912 clinical variants and over 1,550 clinical scenarios.

ACR AC are freely available to all physicians via ACR Select, a module contained within [http://nationaldecisionsupport.com/acrselect/ CareSelect Imaging].

In creating the ACR AC, the ACR Task Force on Appropriateness Criteria incorporated attributes for developing acceptable medical practice guidelines used by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), as designed by the Institute of Medicine.

==Data Registries==
The ACR National Radiology Data Registry (NRDR®) develops benchmarks and comparisons to help imaging facilities improve quality of patient care with its collection of registries related to a range of radiological procedures. NRDR aims to help facilities measure progress, document quality, enhance strengths and identify opportunities for improvement by providing objective measures regarding processes and outcomes in comparison to similar facilities nationwide. Available registries include:

* CT Colonography (CTC) Registry
* Dose Index Registry (DIR)
* Interventional Radiology (IR) Registry
* General Radiology Improvement Database (GRID)
* Lung Cancer Screening Registry (LCSR) &lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;
* National Mammography Database (NMD)

NRDR has been approved as a Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR) for 2018 MIPS Reporting.

It is a thin but tough transparent pair of [[biological membrane|membranes]] that hold a developing [[embryo]] (and later fetus) until shortly before [[birth]]. The inner of these [[fetal membrane]]s, the [[amnion]], encloses the '''amniotic cavity''', containing the [[amniotic fluid]] and the fetus. The outer membrane, the [[chorion]], contains the amnion and is part of the [[placenta]]. On the outer side, the amniotic sac is connected to the [[yolk sac]], the [[allantois]] and, via the [[umbilical cord]], to the [[placenta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larsen|first1=WJ|title=Human Embryology|date=2001|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|isbn=0-443-06583-7|page=40|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Gray31.png|thumb|Amniotic cavity in human embryo 1.3 mm. long]]
The '''amniotic cavity''' is the closed sac between the embryo and the amnion, containing the amniotic fluid. The amniotic cavity is formed by the fusion of the parts of the amniotic fold, which first makes its appearance at the [[cephalic]] extremity, and subsequently at the [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] end and sides of the [[embryo]].  As the amniotic fold rises and fuses over the dorsal aspect of the embryo, the amniotic cavity is formed.

===Development===
At the beginning of the second week, a cavity appears within the inner cell mass and when it enlarges it becomes the amniotic cavity. The floor of the amniotic cavity is formed by the epiblast. Epiblast migrates between the epiblastic disc and trophoblast. In this way the epiblastic cells migrate between the embryoblast and trophoblast. The floor is formed by the epiblast which later on transforms to ectoderm while the remaining cells which are present between the embryoblast and trophoblast are called amnioblasts (flattened cells). These cells are also derived from epiblast which is transformed into ectoderm.

The amniotic cavity is surrounded by a membrane, called the amnion. As the implantation of the blastocyst progresses, a small space appears in the embryoblast, which is the primordium of the amniotic cavity. Soon amniogenic (amnion forming cells) amnioblasts separate from the epiblast and line the amnion, which encloses the amniotic cavity.

The epiblast forms the floor of the amniotic cavity and is continuous peripherally with the amnion. The hypoblast forms the roof of the exocoelomic cavity and is continuous with the thin exocoelomic membrane. This membrane along with hypoblast forms the primary yolk sac. The embryonic disc now lies between the amniotic cavity and the primary yolk sac. Cells from the yolk sac endoderm form a layer of connective tissue, the extraembryonic mesoderm, which surrounds the amnion and yolk sac.

===Birth===
If, after birth, the complete amniotic sac or big parts of the membrane remain coating the newborn, this is called a [[caul]].

When seen in the light, the amniotic sac is shiny and very smooth, but tough.

Once the baby is pushed out of the mother's uterus, the umbilical cord, placenta, and amniotic sac are pushed out in the after birth.

==Function==
The amniotic sac and its filling provide a liquid that surrounds and cushions the fetus. It allows the fetus to move freely within the walls of the [[uterus]].  Buoyancy is also provided.

==Clinical significance==
[[Chorioamnionitis]] is inflammation of the amniotic sac (''[[wikt:chorio-#Prefix|chorio-]]'' + ''amnion'' + ''[[wikt:-itis#Suffix|-itis]]''), usually because of [[infection]]. It is a risk factor for [[neonatal sepsis]].

During [[childbirth|labor]], the amniotic sac must break so that the child can [[birth|be born]]. This is known as [[rupture of membranes]] (ROM). Normally, it occurs spontaneously at full term either during or at the beginning of labor. A [[premature rupture of membranes]] (PROM) is a rupture of the amnion that occurs prior to the onset of labor. An [[artificial rupture of membranes]] (AROM), also known as an amniotomy, may be clinically performed using an amnihook or amnicot in order to induce or to accelerate labour.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6645">'''Beano''' is an [[enzyme]]-based [[dietary supplement]] that is used to reduce gas in the [[digestive tract]], thereby improving digestion and reducing bloating, discomfort, and [[flatulence]] caused by gas. It contains the enzymes [[alpha-galactosidase]] (α-GAL) and [[invertase]]. It was introduced as a liquid, but that has been discontinued and it is now available only as [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]] and strawberry-flavored "Meltaways".

Beano is marketed and distributed by Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc.

== Mechanism of action ==
Beano contains the enzyme α-GAL, which is derived from the fungus ''[[Aspergillus niger]]''. The enzyme works in the [[digestive tract]] to break down the complex or branching sugars ([[polysaccharides]] and [[oligosaccharides]]) in foods such as [[legume]]s ([[bean]]s and [[peanut]]s) and [[cruciferous vegetable]]s ([[cauliflower]], [[broccoli]], [[cabbage]], and [[brussels sprouts]], among others). The enzyme breaks those [[complex carbohydrates|complex sugars]] into [[simple sugars]], making these foods somewhat more digestible, and reducing intestinal gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/gas/|title=Gas in the Digestive Tract|publisher=National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The polysaccharides and oligosaccharides found in these foods might otherwise pass through the [[small intestine]] unaffected. Once in the [[large intestine]], those sugars may be metabolized by [[intestinal flora]], [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermenting]] to produce the gases that cause discomfort.

Two [[randomized controlled trials]] show reduction in gas by subjects taking oral α-GAL.&lt;ref name="pmid17151807"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Stefano M, Miceli E, Gotti S, Missanelli A, Mazzoccahi S, Corazza GR | title = The effect of oral alpha-galactosidase on intestinal gas production and gas-related symptoms | journal = Dig.

== Ingredients ==
Besides the ingredient α-GAL, Beano tablets also contain a second enzyme, invertase, which catalyzes breakdown of sucrose.&lt;ref&gt;B. M. McGrath, G. Walsh 2005. ''Directory of therapeutic enzymes'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=NyzU1PAsKbcC&amp;pg=PA279&amp;lpg=PA279&amp;dq=invertase+symptoms+digestive&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-BFSmqeuP2&amp;sig=SrSEs16XEcQG6aspT4UoPOcdRKY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dgi6SqHbKJ6I8QbLl4mNCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=invertase%20symptoms%20digestive&amp;f=false in Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Beano was developed in 1990 by Alan Kligerman of AkPharma after research into gas-causing vegetables that had begun in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT6344196 |title=US Patent 6,344,196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT5989544 |title=US Patent 5,989,544 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea for such a product was proposed at least as early as the 1780s in [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s essay "[[Fart Proudly|A Letter To A Royal Academy]]". In 1991, Kligerman was awarded the inaugural [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in Medicine for inventing Beano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig1991|title=Improbable Research|website=www.improbable.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its patent was acquired by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] in 2001 from [[Block Drug]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prnwire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/01-16-2001/0001404508&amp;EDATE= |title=GlaxoSmithKline Completes the Purchase of Block Drug for $1.24 Billion |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |accessdate=2010-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GlaxoSmithKline sold Beano and 16 other brands to [[Prestige Brands]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.newsobserver.com/business/gsk-sells-bc-goodys-and-other-brands | work=[[The News &amp; Observer]] | first=David | last=Ranii | title=GSK sells BC, Goody's and other brands | date=21 December 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415192244/http://blogs.newsobserver.com/business/gsk-sells-bc-goodys-and-other-brands | archivedate=15 April 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beano received a {{US patent|5445957}} on August 29, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT5445957 |title=US Patent 5,445,957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The estimated expiration date of this patent is December 5, 2014. {{As of|2013|alt=As of early 2013}}, more than four dozen [[Alpha-galactosidase#Over-the-counter brand names|competing products]] were on the market.

In April 2014, the brand introduced Beano +Dairy Defense. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beanogas.com/en/about-beano/beano-dairy-defense.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715045527/http://beanogas.com/en/about-beano/beano-dairy-defense.aspx |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in brewing ==
Simple [[sugar]]s are also produced as a consequence of the [[malting]] process that eventually produces [[beer]].  The complex sugars are not broken down by the [[yeast]], and are eventually consumed by the beer drinker, possibly causing flatulence. [[Homebrewer]]s have found adding Beano to their brew may produce a beer that has a less malty flavor.&lt;ref name=morebeer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forums.morebeer.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=1224&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a |title=Beano (the anti-gas stuff) helps brewing? |publisher=[[morebeer.com]] |accessdate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beano breaks the complex sugars into simple sugars, and these simple sugars are consumed by the yeast, producing alcohol (or some acetic acid in the aerobic reactions in early fermentation).

The '''Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de Santé''' (BIU Santé) is a French medical library created in 2011.

It offers collections in [[medicine]], [[dentistry]], [[pharmacy]] and related sciences. The BIU Santé resulted from the merging of two other institutions in 2011: the Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de médecine et d'odontologie (BIUM) and the Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de pharmacie (BIUP), even though the two sites remain distinct.

==History==

===The interuniversity Library of Medicine (BIUM)===
The BIUM ("Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de médecine") used to be the Library of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris, which was settled in the [[Middle Ages]] at “rue de la Bûcherie” and then “rue Jean-de-Beauvais”.&lt;ref&gt;André Hahn. La bibliothèque de la Faculté de médecine de Paris. Paris : Librairie Le François, 1929, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The Faculty was removed in 1793. But the National Convention established a Medical School in the former Academy of Surgery, in a building constructed by Jacques Gondouin.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;
Scattered after the closing of the Faculty, the collections were rebuilt by the surgeon and librarian Pierre Sue. They were joined by other holdings from the former Academy of Surgery, the French Royal society of medicine and some of the Capital’s literary works.
During the 19th century and a major part of the 20th century (until the beginning of the 1970s), the library was known as the Library of the Faculty of Medicine in Paris. Its holdings have been increasing since then.

===The interuniversity Library of Pharmacy (BIUP)===

The history of the collection of the "Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de Pharmacie" (BIUP) goes back to 1570, when four masters of the community of apothecaries and grocers donated works to their corporation. The Common Library’s collection was enhanced by other donations from the guards of the community. Until 1777, when the “Collège de Pharmacie de France” was created. In 1803, the holdings of work and archives went under the responsibility of the secretary of the School of Pharmacy and some teachers (in particular Nicolas Gaston Guibourt).

Librarians weren’t required by the School of Pharmacy until 1878. Then the post is formalized in February 1882. In the same year, the School and the library moved from the “Jardin des apothicaires”, “rue de l’Arbalète”, to the Faculty of Pharmacy in Paris, “avenue de l’Observatoire”.

As the establishment’s librarian between 1884 and 1922, the doctor and historian Paul Dorveaux (1851-1938) left a long-lasting imprint on it thanks to the organization of a policy of conservation and acquisition. This policy concerned current scientific production as well as ancient works and manuscripts.

It was under the directions of the doctor and historian Paul Dorveaux (1936-1961) and Yvonne Ruyssen (1961-1973) that the Library experienced new changes: the growing number of staff, the reorganization of the premises and the opening of a new reading room (the Dorveaux room) in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Ruyssen. « La bibliothèque de la Faculté de Pharmacie de Paris à travers le temps », Revue d'histoire de la Pharmacie, XXI, no 218, septembre 1973, p. 535&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1972===

After the University of Paris’ break-up the two libraries and the Scientific Library were integrated in 1972 the “Bibliothèque interuniversitaire d’Île de France” granted under decree 72-132 of the 10th of February.

By the decree 78-1122 of 16 November 1978, each of these libraries regained their autonomy under the respective names of “Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de medecine”(BIUM) and ‘Bibliothèque interuniversiaire de pharmacie” (BIUP).The two entities pertain to the [[Paris Descartes University]]. But the Interuniversity Library is a common service for [[Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University (University of Paris 6)|Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University]], and [[Paris Diderot University]], while the BIUP is a common service for the [[University of Paris-Sud]].

The merging of these two libraries was decided in September 2009 and became effective in 2011.

==Status and operations==

The Library is governed by a convention agreed between the Universities of Paris Descartes, Diderot and Paris-Sud. It is administratively attached to Paris-Descartes University. It is run by a librarian, the latest being Guy Cobolet (general curator).

The BIU Santé is a CADIST (French acronym for center of acquisition and dissemination of scientific and technical information) for medicine, odontology and cosmetology. It is also an associated center of the National Library of France for medicine and pharmacy.

As a research library, the BIU Santé is especially dedicated to students, researchers and teachers within health disciplines, including psychology. It greets every non-academic health professional and every person who conducts researches matching its collections.

The site dedicated to medicine and odontology is established in the old Faculty of Médecine of Paris, “rue de l’Ecole-de-Médecine. These premises shelter the presidency of Paris-Descartes University and the History of Medicine Museum.

The site dedicated to Pharmacy is part of the old premises of the Faculty of Pharmacy in Paris. A reading room for students (Fialon room) opened in 1991.

Readership : 16 000 registered physical users; 130 000 Net surfers consult the library’s website every month, 60% of them live abroad.

==Architecture==

The medical and odontological pole shelters two reading rooms:

* The first public space of the library was [[Louis Landouzy]]’s reading room. It currently has the library’s collections of odontology.
* Located alongside the [[boulevard Saint-Germain]], the great hall was inaugurated in 1891. It was built by Léon Ginain. The architect made a point of honor to see that this hall was six meters longer than Saint-Genevieve Library’s. In 1908, its floor was raised to allow the building of another storage space.

The center of medicine, odontology and cosmetology is currently under construction. It includes two reading rooms:

* The Dorveaux room, in the north wing.
* The Fialon room, in the south wing.

==Collections==

The « BIU Santé » is a reference library recognized at the international level in medical field. It also owns the total of French dissertations in medicine and dental surgery and keeps one copy of each. The Parisian dissertations collection goes back to 1539. The BIU Santé is the depositary of the legal deposits covering works of medicine and dentistry. The whole collection is one of the three richest in the world, with the National Library of Medicine (USA) and the Wellcome Library (London).

To gain more room, the BIU Santé delivered a part of its collections to the “Centre technique du livre de l’enseignement supérieur” (technical book center for higher education), also called CTLes. It mostly concerns dissertations from French provinces or foreign countries and magazines written in non-Latin characters. 

===Medicine-odontology===
* More than 400 000 printed works
* Near 16 000 French and foreign periodicals and 2 000 are currently ongoing.
* Many electronic resources (electronic documents, databases, online periodicals, websites)

===History of health===
* 1.118 manuscripts
* 3.000 works from the 16th century, 6.700 from the 17th, 16.000 from the 18th and 130.000 from the 19th
* Drawings, engravings, photographs and medals

===Pharmacy-biology, cosmetology===
* More than 88.000 volumes ;
* More than 4.000 serial publications (periodicals and collections)
* 204 manuscripts

===Electronic Library===
The website of the BIU Santé includes:
* A modern section (catalogues, databases, online question-and-answer service available on the website BIUMINFO, remote supply of documents, 15 000 bookmarks, etc.)
* And Medic@, a patrimonial electronic library which provides online access to corpus of texts concerning the history of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and health in general, from the 15th to the 20th century. These texts are completed by other documentary products and services (a database containing 85.000 images, virtual exhibitions, a biography and bibliographic database of doctors, electronic publication of thesis and congresses, websites of learned societies).

A scientific magazine called "''e-Mémoires de l’Académie nationale de Chirurgie''" is published by the BIU Santé in collaboration with the National Academy of Surgery.

A '''[[braille]] [[watch]]''' is a portable [[timepiece]] used by the [[blindness|blind or visually impaired]] to tell time.&lt;ref name= "blindwatch"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26920782 |title=A watch for blind people |work=[[BBC]] |date=2014-04-09 |accessdate=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by touching the dial and noticing the embossments. Both [[Watch#Analog|analog]] and [[Watch#Digital|digital versions]] are available. The analog versions have a protective glass or crystal cover that is flipped open when time needs to be read and the clock-hands are constructed to not be susceptible to movement at the mere touch of the finger that a blind person uses to observe their positions. 
In the digital form, the dots (like [[Braille|braille script]]) keep changing position as time changes. In this case, one must understand the [[Braille alphabet]] to read the watch.

Electronic ''[[Talking clock|talking watches]]'', which speak the time at the touch of a button, are also popular among people who are blind.&lt;ref name="Goes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goes |first=Frank Joseph |title=The Eye in History p. 235|publisher=JP Medical Ltd |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-3509-0274-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cannabis in Malawi''' is prohibited, but remains a popular drug and is produced for domestic use and export. In [[Chichewa]], it is locally known as '''chamba'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/920052.stm |title=AFRICA &amp;#124; Malawi Rastas' marijuana struggle |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-09-11 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chamba is grown mainly in central and northern regions like [[Mzuzu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/17/world/marijuana-cultivation-increases-in-malawi.html |title=Marijuana Cultivation Increases in Malawi - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1998-12-17 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malawian cannabis, particularly the strain known as [[Malawi Gold]], is internationally renowned as one of the finest [[Cannabis sativa|sativa strains]] from Africa.&lt;ref name="marijuanatipster1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marijuanatipster.com/tiki-index.php?page=Malawi%20Gold |title=Marijuana Wikipedia : Malawi Gold |publisher=Marijuanatipster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[World Bank]] report it is among "the best and finest" marijuana strains in the world,&lt;ref name="bnltimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnltimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2877:malawis-chamba-valued-at-k1-4-billion&amp;catid=42:national&amp;Itemid=401|title=BNL Times - Malawi's Premier News|work=BNL Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; generally regarded as one of the most potent psychoactive pure African sativas. The popularity of this variety has led to such a profound increase in marijuana tourism and economic profit in Malawi that Malawi Gold is listed as one of the three "Big C's" in Malawian exports: [[Tilapia|chambo]] (Tilapia fish), chombe (tea), and chamba (cannabis).&lt;!-- DON'T CITE MALAWI24, THEY'RE CITING WIKIPEDIA --&gt;{{cn|date=November 2016}}

==Cultivation==
Malawi is one of the largest producers of cannabis in Southern Africa.&lt;ref name="iss.co.za"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iss.co.za/uploads/CANNABIS.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614085640/http://www.iss.co.za/uploads/CANNABIS.PDF |archivedate=2012-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mainly cultivated in remote parts of the [[Central Region, Malawi|central]] and [[Northern Region, Malawi|northern regions]]. In the north, it can be found growing in [[Mzimba District|Mzimba District's]] [[Likwawa hills]], and in Nkohotakota district.&lt;ref name="iss.co.za"/&gt; [[Nkhotakota District]] is known for producing the best marijuana, particularly near the banks of [[Lupache river]].&lt;ref name="iss.co.za"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ospiti.peacelink.it"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ospiti.peacelink.it/npeople/lug99/PAG6JULY.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406065800/http://ospiti.peacelink.it/npeople/lug99/PAG6JULY.html |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be found at smaller quantities in the districts of [[Ntchisi District|Ntchisi]], [[Kasungu District|Kasungu]], [[Ntcheu District|Ntcheu]] and [[Dedza District|Dedza]]. Most growers cultivate small, out of the way fields up on remote mountain hills, hidden in bushes, or intercropped with other field crops.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTFINANCIALSECTOR/Resources/Ill_gotten_money_and_economy.pdf |title=Ill Gotten Money and Economy |website=World Bank Document |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few commercial farmers.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt; The United Nations Development Assistance Framework report that in the late 1990s, estimated that up to {{convert|385000|acre|km2}} in the country were devoted to the cultivation of marijuana.&lt;ref name="bnltimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnltimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=378 |title=UDF factions 'agree' |publisher=Bnltimes.com |date=2011-03-02 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Women are largely involved in cultivation of chamba, while men are mainly involved in marketing it.&lt;ref name="iss.co.za"/&gt; In Malawi, the [[marijuana]] buds are cured after being tightly bound in banana or maize leaves. They are sold in units called 'cobs'.

==International market==
Its quality has led it to out-perform marijuana grown in other countries in terms of sales in each market it is introduced in.&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=181lPZfuh08 |title=The Weed Inc. Pt. 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-09-08 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; International organized groups employ Malawians to purchase and produce cannabis from local producers.&lt;ref name="iss.co.za"/&gt; It mainly crosses Malawi borders through Mozambique and Zimbabwe, to South Africa. For South Africa, it has led to an increase in [[marijuana tourism]] from holiday makers seeking cannabis. More recently Malawian cannabis has now flooded the marijuana markets in Kenya, Tanzania, and many other locales.&lt;ref name="youtube1"/&gt; In Kenya, one cob of pure, smokable marijuana is worth US$1.97. About US$0.32 is paid to the original farmer.&lt;ref name="bnltimes.com"/&gt; It even was available in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="bnltimes1"/&gt;

===Fame===
For many marijuana smokers, the strain Malawi Gold has reached almost a cult status. There are websites and blogs which have been dedicated to the praise of chamba.&lt;ref name="bnltimes1"/&gt; Legends and myths have developed surrounding the potency of the drug, as an example, there is a popular story about visitors that came to Malawi, tried chamba, and lost the will to return to their country of origin.&lt;ref name="Malawi : On a mission in Africa"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/africaandindianocean/malawi/720947/Malawi-On-a-mission-in-Africa.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Malawi : On a mission in Africa | date=1998-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marijuana tourism===
Malawi gains a significant amount of its tourism from the marijuana trade. Albeit illegal, the plant grows in the wild in many areas, which has made it hard to control. In the lake areas, many tourists purchase the drug and smoke it in the privacy of their hotel rooms or homes. Tourists in Malawi known to shop for chamba in the [[Nkhotakota District]] which has a reputation for producing the best marijuana.&lt;ref name="ospiti.peacelink.it"/&gt;

==Domestic market==
Illegal trade in chamba amounts to an estimated 0.2% of Malawi's GDP or K1.4 billion.&lt;ref name="bnltimes.com"/&gt; The majority of the product is not used locally since it is primarily grown for an export market.&lt;ref name="bnltimes.com"/&gt; Integration in the global market has resulted to unfair trade therefore Malawian growers are getting underpaid.&lt;ref name="bnltimes.com"/&gt; Malawi farmers receive only about a fifth of the price for which it is being sold in foreign consumer markets.&lt;ref name="bnltimes.com"/&gt; It does however, fetch more money than Malawis largest export, [[tobacco]].&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt; Most growers do not sell it directly to the market themselves, but instead to national or international traffickers.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt;

===Medicinal usage===
Cannabis was widely used by the entire population as an intoxicant and as medicine in treating conditions like anthrax, dysentery, fevers, malaria, or snakebites.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt; [[Rastafari]] in Malawi now are the proponents that claim medicinal use of the chamba leaves. A research study entitled, "Patients' Perceptions of Chamba (marijuana) Use in Malawi" was conducted in Zomba Mental Hospital was published in the International Journal of the Addictions in 1998. It had it implications for the development of treatment and prevention programs for chamba users in Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a905510898 ]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious usage===
[[Malawian Rastafari]] have been using marijuana as part of their spiritual awakening for years. The Rastafari cite religious importance in the use of the plant.&lt;ref name="youtube1"/&gt;

===Recreational use===
Malawians have been using cannabis for recreational use for generations. The use of cannabis is particularly popular along the lake side. Many Malawians claim that cannabis helps them to relax and concentrate. Local students use cannabis to prevent pre-exam jitters. Police raids are common, however recreational use of cannabis remains unabated. Many [[Backpacking (travel)|backpackers]] and [[Overlanding|overlanders]] are attracted to Malawi due to recreational use of inexpensive cannabis.&lt;ref name="Malawi : On a mission in Africa"/&gt;

==Legal issues concerning usage==
Growing, selling, using, or possessing cannabis is a criminal offense in Malawi.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt;  Although cannabis is illegal in Malawi, it is estimated to be the largest unofficial export. Malawian economists group the illegal export as one of the three 'Big C's' in Malawian exports ''chambo'' (fish), ''chombe'' (tea) ''chamba'' (cannabis)'. The growth in sales means that there are growers cultivating the drug illegally in Malawi due to the large profits they gain from its sales.&lt;ref name="bnltimes1"/&gt; However a recent World Bank study reported that Malawian farmers are being underpaid for their labor in the trade.&lt;ref name="bnltimes.com"/&gt; The production and selling of chamba has been increasing in Malawi over the past few years.&lt;ref name="iss.co.za"/&gt; The efforts to curb its production and selling is also on the increase.&lt;ref name="iss.co.za"/&gt; Anti-drug unit is led by the Malawi Police Services that confiscate about 70,000 kilos of cannabis per year for the year 2010.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"/&gt;

Below are the United Nations figures on number of cannabis seizures in Malawi from 1995 - 2000 published in the 2003 Institute for Security Studies Report:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gastrow, Institute for Security Studies, Cape town, Published: October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign to legalize cannabis===
Rastafari in Malawi have gone to court to demand their right to smoke cannabis. In 2000, the government briefly explored the possible legalization of Indian hemp, despite police warnings of potential abuse by cannabis growers.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/708649.stm |title=AFRICA &amp;#124; Legal hemp for Malawi? |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-04-24 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was championed in parliament by Deputy Minister of Agriculture [[Joe Manduwa]] who argued that the plant could be a valuable alternative to tobacco.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt; The idea was supported by member of parliament and medical doctor, [[Hetherwick Ntaba]] who argued that it is non-addictive.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

The '''Creighton University School of Medicine''' is the graduate medical school at [[Creighton University]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], United States, and grants the [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) degree. It was founded in 1892. A new satellite campus opened in 2012 at [[St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], becoming the first Jesuit medical program west of Omaha. All matriculating students complete preclinical coursework in Omaha, and 42 third-year students complete their clinical rotations in Phoenix, with elective options at both campuses during their fourth year.

In 2017, the new primary teaching hospital will be [[Bergan Mercy Medical Center]]. Both are affiliates of [[CHI Health]], a division of [[Catholic Health Initiatives]].

==Academics==

===Preclinical years===
The first two years of school, known as the preclinical years, focus on learning the science of medicine.  The first year consists of classes in Anatomy, Molecular and Cell Biology, Ethical and Legal Topics in Clinical Medicine, Interviewing and Physical Exam, Host Defense, Principles of Microbiology, Evidence Based Medicine, Principles of Pharmacology, Behavioral Medicine I, CU Humanities Program, Neuroscience, and Physicians Lifestyle Management.  Healer's Art is an elective course that can be taken at the beginning of the spring semester.  Following spring break, the M1 year ends with the first organ systems course, Neuroscience.

The second year of medical school consists of organ systems based classes that last from 2–5 weeks each.  These courses include Infectious Diseases, Hematology/Oncology, Cardiovascular, Behavioral Medicine II, Respiratory, Renal, Endocrine/ Reproduction, Musculoskeletal/ Integument, Gastrointestinal, and Behavioral Medicine II.  There are also two concurrent classes that run throughout the year which include Case Studies in Medicine and Applied Clinical Skills.  The year ends with review and time to study for the [[USMLE Step 1]] which is taken between the end of May and the middle of June.

===Clinical years===
The third and fourth years of medical school consist of clinical rotations throughout hospitals and clinics.  There are eight third year clinical rotations that last 8 weeks each: Ambulatory Primary care, Inpatient Medicine, Psychiatry, Surgery, Pediatrics, and Obstetrics and Gynecology.  Fourth year consists of 1 4-week surgical selective, 1 4-week critical care selective, 1 4-week primary care selective or 2nd critical care selective, and an additional 24 weeks of clinical electives with no more than 8 weeks of non-clinical electives.  A senior [[Objective structured clinical examination]] (OSCE) is required prior to completion of [[USMLE Step 2 CS]] and graduation.

Third year medical students are able to do family medicine rotations in rural Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Arizona.  Creighton also sends a group of third year students to San Francisco for internal medicine rotations.&lt;ref&gt;http://medschool.creighton.edu/phoenix/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phoenix campus===
Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha and St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center have created an academic affiliation that will create a Creighton medical school presence in Phoenix. The Creighton campus in Phoenix will be the only Catholic medical school campus located west of Omaha.

The affiliation will expand educational opportunities available to Creighton medical students while allowing the University's School of Medicine to recruit more students. The collaboration is also designed to strengthen the medical reputations of both institutions, promote the sharing of faculty and administrative expertise, create collaborative research opportunities, and enhance medical services for Arizona patients.

Since 2005, Creighton and St. Joseph's have had an agreement that sends Creighton medical students to Phoenix for one-month rotations. Under the new affiliation, Creighton will establish a fully operational campus at St. Joseph's that will offer two full years of clinical training. Creighton expanded its entering medical class from 126 to 152 students in 2010. All students will train for their first two years in Omaha. Starting in 2012, 42 third-year students will move to Phoenix for their final two years of training, and 110 third-year students will remain in Omaha. The Phoenix campus will graduate its first students in 2014.

==Student clubs and organizations==

===Service===
Creighton emphasizes community service, and even though it is not required, 100% of students participate in some form of service during their time in medical school.  Creighton students operate and staff the Magis Clinic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medschool.creighton.edu/magis/about/|title=Magis Clinic {{!}} Magis Clinic {{!}} Creighton University|website=medschool.creighton.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides free health care to the homeless and poor in Omaha.

Between first and second year, many medical students participate in Project CURA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://creighton.collegiatelink.net/organization/ProjectCURA/about|title=Project CURA - About Us|website=creighton.collegiatelink.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CURA is a student-run program which sends medical missions to countries including Peru, Ghana, India, and Nicaragua.  CUSOM is also home to the Institute for Latin American Concern (ILAC),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.creighton.edu/ministry/ilac/&lt;/ref&gt; which sends fourth-year medical students, as well as pharmacy and nursing students, to the Dominican Republic.

Creighton [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Phi Chi - Chi Upsilon|Phi Chi]] is a co-ed medical fraternity located near campus.  Fraternity members take turns preparing nightly meals and share a large house near campus.  All residents have their own rooms, with private or shared bathrooms.  Phi Chi is known for its annual Halloween party.

The 20th century history of '''cremation in Romania''' began in 1923, when the Romanian Cremation Society, called ''Cenuşa'' ("Ashes"), was formed. In February 1928, the [[Bucharest]] Crematorium, also called Cenuşa, began operations. It cremated 262 corpses that year, the figure rising to 602 in 1934. In 1935, 0.19% of Romania's dead were cremated there.

==History==
Aside from the [[Soviet Union]], Romania was the only nation in Eastern Europe to have an operational crematorium before [[World War II]], though one was built in [[Debrecen]], [[Hungary]] in 1932, it was not opened until 1951.  In the interwar period, Cenuşa was privately run and built the crematorium from its own funds. It faced opposition from the dominant [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], which still prohibits cremation, and suffered from financial shortfalls. It was somewhat reliant on "administrative cremations" of, for instance, body parts from anatomical institutions, which paid well.  By 1937, the society was making gains. It recruited 184 members that year, bringing the total to 1006. In 1934 it had begun an eight-page monthly journal, ''Flacăra Sacră'' (''The Sacred Flame''), focusing on domestic and international developments in the field. However, Cenuşa failed to join the International Cremation Federation (ICF) when it was established in 1938.

[[World War II]] brought change to the status of cremation in Romania. In 1938, a cremator that had been ordered and paid for was not delivered before the war's outbreak. When [[Bombing of Bucharest in World War II|Bucharest was bombed]] in 1944, the crematorium suffered considerable damage, leading to further financial difficulties for the society. However, religious opposition softened somewhat, and corpses from the provinces were brought in increasing numbers. In 1945 there were 600 cremations, up from 225 in 1944.

The contact established between the ICF and Cenuşa in late 1946 was the last to occur for decades, as the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] was installed soon after. During the Communist period, many prominent regime figures, including [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], [[Chivu Stoica]] and [[Teohari Georgescu]], were cremated and had their ashes placed in the ''Monument of the Heroes for the Freedom of the People and of the Motherland, for Socialism'' in Bucharest's [[Carol Park]], whence they were removed after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]]. ''[[The Internationale]]'' was customarily played for them at their cremation, although [[Ana Pauker]]'s family had [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Third Symphony]] played instead.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;Robert Levy, "Ana Pauker: The Rise and Fall of a Jewish Communist", [[University of California Press]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], 2001, p.225 {{ISBN|0-520-23747-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1987, the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu|Ceauşescu]] regime's problems were also affecting cremation, as a power crisis meant that low gas pressure was insufficient to allow for full cremation of corpses. Anti-regime groups charged that some ashes were given to families and the half-cremated bodies disposed of in mass burials. However, corpses of wealthy and powerful figures were retained until sufficient pressure existed for a full cremation.

After a fairly rapid post-war advance, the incidence of cremation slowed considerably. A second crematorium, ''Vitan-Bârzeşti'' (named after the Bucharest neighbourhood where it is located), was opened in 1993, after Ceauşescu's fall from power. Nevertheless, in 1999, 1172 cremations were performed in Romania, representing just 10% of deaths in Bucharest. In neighbouring [[Bulgaria]], which opened its first crematorium in 2001, almost 5% of nationwide dead &amp;ndash; 5254 &amp;ndash; were cremated in 2002.

'''Cyclic vomiting syndrome''' (US English) or '''cyclical vomiting syndrome''' (UK English) ('''CVS''') is a chronic [[Functional disorder|functional condition]] of unknown cause characterised by recurring attacks of intense [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and sometimes [[abdominal pain]], [[headaches]], or [[migraine]]s. CVS typically develops during [[childhood]], usually between ages 3 and 7; although it often remits during [[adolescence]], it can persist into adult life.&lt;ref name="Lindley 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16131963 |year=2005 |last1=Lindley |first1=Keith J |last2=Andrews |first2=Paul L |title=Pathogenesis and Treatment of Cyclical Vomiting |volume=41 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S38–40 |journal=[[Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology &amp; Nutrition]] |doi=10.1097/01.scs.0000180299.04731.cb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Li2008&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/MPG.0b013e318173ed39 |title=North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Consensus Statement on the Diagnosis and Management of Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome |year=2008 |last1=Li |first1=B UK |last2=Lefevre |first2=Frank |last3=Chelimsky |first3=Gisela G |last4=Boles |first4=Richard G |last5=Nelson |first5=Susanne P |last6=Lewis |first6=Donald W |last7=Linder |first7=Steven L |last8=Issenman |first8=Robert M |last9=Rudolph |first9=Colin D |last10=North American Society For Pediatric Gastroenterology |first10=Hepatology |journal=Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=379–93 |pmid=18728540|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2982.2008.01113.x |title=Cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults |year=2008 |last1=Abell |first1=T.

==Signs and symptoms==
Sufferers may vomit or retch 6–12 times in an hour and an episode may last from a few hours to over three weeks and in some cases months, with a median episode duration of 41 hours.&lt;ref name=Li1999&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10490033 |year=1999 |last1=Li |first1=BU |last2=Fleisher |first2=DR |title=Cyclic vomiting syndrome: Features to be explained by a pathophysiologic model |volume=44 |issue=8 Suppl |pages=13S–18S |journal=Digestive Diseases and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acid, bile and, if the vomiting is severe, [[haematemesis|blood]] may be vomited. Some sufferers will ingest water to reduce the [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|irritation of bile and acid on the esophagus]] during emesis. Between episodes, the sufferer is usually normal and healthy otherwise but can be in a weak state of [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] or experience [[myalgia|muscle pain]]. In approximately half of cases the attacks, or episodes, occur in a time-related manner. Each attack is stereotypical; that is, in any given individual, the timing, frequency and severity of attacks is similar.

Episodes may happen every few days, every few weeks or every few months. For some sufferers, there is not a pattern in time that can be recognized. Some sufferers have a warning of an attack; they may experience a [[prodrome]], usually intense nausea and [[pallor]], heightened sensitivity, especially to light, though sensitivity to smell, sound, pressure, and temperature, as well as oncoming muscle pain and fatigue, are also reported by some patients. The majority of sufferers can identify triggers that may precipitate an attack. The most common are various foods, [[infection]]s (e.g., [[colds]]), menstruation, extreme physical exertion, lack of sleep, and psychological [[stress (biological)|stress]]es, both positive and negative.

A sufferer may also be light-sensitive ([[photophobia|photophobic]]), sound-sensitive ([[phonophobia|phonophobic]]) or, less frequently, temperature- or pressure-sensitive during an attack.&lt;ref name="Lindley 2005" /&gt;  Some sufferers also have a strong urge to bathe in warm or cold water. Some sufferers report that they experience a restless sensation or stinging pain along the spine, hands, and feet followed by weakness in both legs. Some of these symptoms may be due to dehydration rather than the underlying cause of CVS.

==Genetics==
Many affected individuals have a family history of related conditions, such as migraines, in their mothers and maternal relatives, suggesting mitochondrial inheritance. Single [[base-pair]] and DNA rearrangements in the [[mitochondrial]] DNA have been associated with these traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=What is cyclic vomiting syndrome? | url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}
The cause of CVS has not been determined and there are no diagnostic tests for CVS. Several other medical conditions, such as [[cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome]], can mimic the same symptoms, and it is important to rule these out. If all other possible causes have been excluded, a diagnosis of CVS may be appropriate.

Once formal investigations to rule out gastrointestinal or other causes have been conducted, these tests do not need to be repeated in the event of future episodes.&lt;ref name="Lindley 2005" /&gt;

===Diagnostic criteria===
Although there are differences{{such as}} between early-onset CVS (babies and children) and late-onset CVS (in adults),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boles|first=R. G.|last2=Zaki|first2=E. A.|last3=Lavenbarg|first3=T.|last4=Hejazi|first4=R.|last5=Foran|first5=P.|last6=Freeborn|first6=J.|last7=Trilokekar|first7=S.|last8=McCallum|first8=R.|date=September 2009|title=Are pediatric and adult-onset cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) biologically different conditions?

#A history of three or more periods of intense, acute nausea and unremitting vomiting, as well as pain in some cases, lasting hours to days and even weeks or months&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sagar, Sood, Gracie, Gold, To, Law, Ford|first=|date=2018|title=Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a prevalent and under-recognized condition in the gastroenterology outpatient clinic|url=|journal=Neurogastroenterology &amp; Motility|volume=30|pages=|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Intervening symptom-free or reduced-symptom intervals, lasting weeks to months
#There are repeated cycles of periods (of varying duration) with intense/acute nausea, with or without vomiting, with or without severe pain, followed by periods of reduced symptoms, followed by gradual increase in CVS symptoms until it peaks (peak intensity is generally relative to cycle intensity).
#Exclusion of metabolic, gastrointestinal, or central nervous system structural or biochemical disease, e.g., individuals with specific physical causes (such as intestinal malrotation)

==Treatment==
There is no known cure for CVS, but there are medications that can be used for treatment, intervention, and prevention.  There is a growing body of publications on both individual cases and the experiences of the CVS cohort. Treatment is usually on an individual basis, based on trial and error.

The most common therapeutic strategies for those already in an attack are maintenance of salt balance by appropriate intravenous fluids&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hejazi, McCallum|first=|date=2014|title=Cyclic vomiting syndrome: treatment options|url=|journal=Experimental Brain Research|volume=8|pages=2549–2552|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in some cases, sedation. Having vomited for a long period prior to attending a hospital, patients are typically severely dehydrated. For a number of patients, potent anti-emetic drugs such as [[ondansetron]] (Zofran) or [[granisetron]] (Kytril), and [[dronabinol]] (Marinol) may be helpful in either preventing an attack, aborting an attack, or reducing the severity of an attack. Lifestyle changes may be recommended, such as extended rest and reduction of stress.&lt;ref name="NHS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cyclical-vomiting-syndrome/ |title=Cyclical vomiting syndrome |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=NHS Gov.UK |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the symptoms of CVS are similar (or perhaps identical) to those of the disease well-identified as "[[ICHD classification and diagnosis of migraine#Abdominal migraine|abdominal migraine]]", treatment of CVS with a regimen of anti-migraine drugs, such as [[topiramate]] and [[amitriptyline]], is showing promise in preventing recurrent attacks.

==Prognosis==
Fitzpatrick et al. (2007) identified 41 children with CVS. The mean age of the sample was 6 years at the onset of the syndrome, 8 years at first diagnosis, and 13 years at follow-up. As many as 39% of the children had resolution of symptoms immediately or within weeks of the diagnosis. Vomiting had resolved at the time of follow-up in 61% of the sample. Many children, including those in the remitted group, continued to have somatic symptoms such as headaches (in 42%) and abdominal pain (in 37%).&lt;ref name="pmid18070235"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fitzpatrick |first=E |author2=Bourke B |author3=Drumm B |author4=Rowland M |title=The incidence of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children: population-based study |journal=Am J Gastroenterol |date=April 2008 |volume=103 |issue=4 |pages=991–5 |pmid=18070235 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2007.01668.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most children who have this disorder miss on average 24 school days a year.&lt;ref name="Li2008" /&gt;  The frequency of episodes is higher for some people during times of excitement.&lt;ref name="Li2008"/&gt;  Charitable organizations to support sufferers and their families and to promote knowledge of CVS exist in several countries.

===Mortality===
{{multiple issues|section=y|{{weasel|section|date=February 2018}}
{{tone|section|date=February 2018}}}}

There is little hard evidence of death as a result of the condition. However, in severe cases the fluid loss can lead to potentially life-threatening electrolyte imbalances. The patient can also become malnourished if the attacks last too long without adequate replenishment of nutrients. With adequate medical interventions, most patients can be properly supported during an episode.&lt;ref name="NHS"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
{{multiple issues|section=y|{{tone|section|date=February 2018}}

The average age at onset is 3–7 years, but CVS has been seen in infants who are as young as 6 days and in adults who are as old as 73 years.&lt;ref name=LM2003&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0889-8553(03)00045-1 |title=Cyclic vomiting syndrome: A brain–gut disorder |year=2003 |last1=Li |first1=B U.K |last2=Misiewicz |first2=Larry |journal=Gastroenterology Clinics of North America |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=997–1019 |pmid=14562585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical delay in diagnosis from onset of symptoms is 2.7–3 years.&lt;ref name=LM2003 /&gt; Females show a slight predominance over males; the female-to-male ratio is 57:43.&lt;ref name="LM2003" /&gt;

==History==
Cyclic vomiting syndrome was first described in [[France]] by [[Switzerland|Swiss]] physician Henri Clermond Lombard&lt;ref&gt;Lombard HC. Description d'une névrose de la digestion, caractérisée par des crises périodiques de vomissements et une profonde modification de l'assimilation. ''Gazette Medicale de Paris''. 1861:312.&lt;/ref&gt; and first described in the [[English language]] by pediatrician [[Samuel Gee]] in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Gee S. On fitful or recurrent vomiting. St Bartholomew Hospital Reports. 1882;18:1.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that [[Charles Darwin's health|Charles Darwin's adult illnesses]] may have been due to this syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.b4968 |title=Darwin's illness revisited |year=2009 |last1=Hayman |first1=J.

As of 2007, there are almost one million people with various levels of physical and mental disabilities in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="unitedway.org.tw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.unitedway.org.tw/employment-disabilities|title=Creating Employment Opportunities for People with Disabilities|website=United Way of Taiwan|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan adopted a universal healthcare system in 1995 to properly support patient care and provide more transparent access to its people, including those who identify as disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Tai-Yin|last2=Majeed|first2=Azeem|last3=Kuo|first3=Ken N|date=2010–2012|title=An overview of the healthcare system in Taiwan|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3960712/|journal=London Journal of Primary Care|volume=3|issue=2|pages=115–119|issn=1757-1472|pmc=3960712|pmid=25949636|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Taiwan is a nation that has grown tremendously to support those that are disabled. This includes having a socialized form of medical care that is run by the executive branch of government known as “Yuan”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.ey.gov.tw/cp.aspx?n=0B5424E21E6FF0A5&amp;Create=1|title=Executive Yuan, R.O.C.

(Taiwan)|language=zh-tw|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall this universal scheme includes the law, public facilities, and educational aspect of healthcare. Taiwan also has different aspects of healthcare to effectively support those that are disadvantaged or disabled, this included subsidies, loans, plans, service guarantee and specific care for medically vulnerable populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhi.gov.tw/Resource/webdata/30285_1_National%20Health%20Insurance%20in%20Taiwan%202015-2016%20(bilingual).pdf|title=National Health Insurance Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan's healthcare development and dedication to support its people plays an important role in its transformation of benefits for the disabled.

== History ==
Prior to the 1980s, the term referring to people with disabilities translated to "useless and worthless disability".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Heng-hao|date=2014-12-02|title=Social Change and the Disability Rights Movement in Taiwan 1981-2002|url=http://www.rdsjournal.org/index.php/journal/article/view/297|journal=Review of Disability Studies: An International Journal|language=en|volume=3|issue=1 &amp; 2|issn=1552-9215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The government was not responsible for providing supporting or funding those with disabilities. Families and non-profit, private organizations were responsible for supporting the disabled. However, institutions were not regulated, as some were inhumane and the quality of service, questionable. However, as Taiwan underwent industrialization, mothers were forced to enter the work force and could no longer support their children with disabilities. The once-questionable facilities were forced to reform and become suitable for taking care children with disabilities. In addition, in 1975, the [[United Nations]] released the [[Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons|"Declaration of the Rights of Disabled Persons"]] which forced the government to reform their original disability policy.Taiwanese disability policies became heavily influenced by international disability laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiu|first=Chun-Yu|last2=Turnbull|first2=H.

==Law==
In 1980, the Welfare Law for the Handicapped and Disabled was enacted which listed six types of disabilities. The law has been amended several times since then until in 1997 it became the Protection Law for the Handicapped and Disabled listing fourteen disabilities.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=12,29,33,45&amp;post=22073|title=Helping the Disabled Is Helping Ourselves|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Taiwan Today|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Taiwan adopted the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] to upholds its human rights protection for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201711030035.aspx|date=3 November 2017|first1=Wei-ting|last1=Chen|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Hsu|title=Taiwan's protection of rights for the disabled fall short: expert|publisher=Focus Taiwan|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disabilities Rights Protection Act was enacted in July 2007.&lt;ref name="angloinfo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/taiwan/healthcare/people-with-disabilities|title=People With Disabilities|publisher=Angloinfo|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan Accessibility Building Code was amended in 2008 for buildings to provide more access for disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americantrails.org/resources/accessible/Taiwan-accessible-parks-trails.html|first1=Jacky|last1=Hsu|first2=Ming-de|last2=Chen|title=TAIWAN: Advocates work for accessible trails|website=American Trails|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public Officials Election and Recall Law was amended on 26 November 2008 to ensure any [[polling place]] is barrier-free venue or equipped with tools or additional facilities if such venue does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/taiwan-election-law-amended-to-provide-disabled-better-polling-station-access/|title=Taiwan: Election Law Amended to Provide Disabled Better Polling Station Access|first1=Wendy|last1=Zeldin|date=8 December 2008|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of disability was refined to include more than health and body impairment related disabilities. In a study to identify the children and the gap between independence and frequency, in which independence means the capability of a child or what they "can do" which the frequency pertains to the extent to which they can carry out a task or what a child "does do", the children with mild severity in [[Taiwan]] showed more frequency restrictions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;In another study, children with [[intellectual disability]] showed more signs of "aggression, self-injurious behavior or physical complaints" but not signs of "[[Depression (mood)|depression]] and anxiety complaints."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=J.

=== Policies ===
There are separate policies for children and adults. One of the policies for students with disabilities is the Taiwan Special Education Act of 2013 to provide special education laws.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Before the Taiwan Special Education Act of 2013, there was The First Children's Development Center founded in 1981 for students with [[Intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;However, there are no regulations for children under the age of 2, as regulations only allow school age students to utilize special education services. Educational institutions are required to accommodate and meet the needs of all students, providing the necessary accommodations, assistive technology and accessible campus. Another policy that pertains to children with disabilities is the Taiwan People with Disabilities Rights Protection Act of 2013. Children are protected from anti-discrimination statute.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Through the increased human-rights advocacy and the civil rights movement for disabilities, Taiwan has been improving disability rights by creating more inclusive communities and increasing opportunities for students with disabilities.

===Schools===
There are 20 special schools in Taiwan dedicated for the blind, deaf, handicapped and mentally retarded students. Students are either take bus or live within the school compounds. Those with severe disabilities, visiting teachers will visit them to hospitals or homes.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1520">A '''duction''' is an [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]] involving only one [[human eye|eye]].&lt;ref&gt;Kanski, JJ. ''Clinical Ophthalmology: A Systematic Approach.'' Boston:Butterworth-Heinemann;1989.&lt;/ref&gt; There are generally six possible movements depending upon the eye's [[axis of rotation]]:
#[[Abduction (physiology)|Abduction]] refers to the outward movement of an eye.
#[[Adduction]] refers to the inward movement of an eye
#Supraduction / sursumduction / elevation
#Infraduction / deosumduction / depression
#Incycloduction / intorsion
#Excycloduction / extorsion

== Forced duction test ==

The forced duction test is performed in order to determine whether the absence of movement of the eye is due to a neurological disorder or a mechanical restriction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Forced_duction Forced duction - definition from Biology-Online.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The anesthetized conjunctiva is grasped with forceps and an attempt is made to move the eyeball in the direction where the movement is restricted. If a mechanical restriction is present, it will not be possible to induce a passive movement of the eyeball.&lt;ref&gt;Kunimoto D, Kanitkar K &amp; Makar M. ''The Wills Eye Manual.

'''Energy medicine''', '''energy therapy''', '''energy healing''', '''psychic healing''', '''spiritual medicine''' or '''spiritual healing''' are branches of [[alternative medicine]] based on a [[pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] belief that healers can channel healing [[Energy (esotericism)|energy]] into a patient and effect positive results. This idea itself contains several methods:  hands-on,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; hands-off,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; and distant&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=brockhampton&gt;{{cite book |title= Guide to Spiritual Healing |last= Daulby |first= Martin |first2= Caroline |last2=Mathison |year= 1996 |publisher= Brockhampton Press |isbn= 1-86019-370-6 |page=89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (or absent) where the patient and healer are in different locations.

Many schools of energy healing exist using many names, for example, ''biofield energy healing'',&lt;ref name="mdanderson"&gt;{{cite web | year=2007 | url=http://www.mdanderson.org/publications/network/issues/2007-fall/network-fall-2007-energy-medicines-will-east-meet-west-.html | title=Energy Medicines: Will East Meet West? | author1=Network newsletter | author2=MD Anderson Cancer Center | access-date=November 30, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125021822/http://www.mdanderson.org/publications/network/issues/2007-fall/network-fall-2007-energy-medicines-will-east-meet-west-.html | archive-date=November 25, 2010 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="springerlink"&gt;{{cite web |date=October 2007  | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n772q20j61180nj0/ | title=Biofield Therapies: Helpful or Full of Hype? | work=International Journal of Behavioral Medicine (Volume 17, Number 1, 1–16) | doi=10.1007/s12529-009-9062-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''spiritual healing'',&lt;ref name="Ernst 2001 88–92"&gt;{{cite journal | title=A primer of complementary and alternative medicine commonly used by cancer patients |authorlink=Edzard Ernst | journal=Medical Journal of Australia | first=Edzard | last=Ernst | year=2001 | volume=174|issue=2 | pages=88–92|pmid=11245510 |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/174_02_150101/ernst/ernst.html#suba10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''contact healing'', ''distant healing'', ''Qi Do'', ''[[therapeutic touch]]'',&lt;ref name="Therapeutic Touch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/ManualHealingandPhysicalTouch/therapeutic-touch |title=Therapeutic Touch |publisher=Cancer.org |date=June 2, 2008 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Reiki]]''&lt;ref name="Reiki Practice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/reiki/ |title=Reiki Practice |publisher=Nccih.nih.gov |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Qigong]].''&lt;ref name="mdanderson"/&gt;

There is a history of association or exploitation of scientific inventions by individuals claiming that newly discovered science could help people to heal: In the 19th century, electricity and magnetism were in the "borderlands" of science and electrical quackery was rife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Science and spiritual healing: a critical review of spiritual healing, "energy" medicine, and intentionality|date=March–April 2003|journal=Altern Ther Health Med|volume=9|issue=2|pages=56–61|pmid=12652884|last1=Jonas|first1=WB|last2=Crawford|first2=CC}}&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts continue to inspire writers in the [[New Age]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Energy Forms: Allegory and Science in the Era of Classical Thermodynamics|publisher=University of Michigan Press|date=November 8, 2001|isbn=0-472-11174-4|author=Bruce Clarke.|page=Clarke, Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century [[radioactive quackery|health claims for radio-active materials]] put lives at risk,&lt;ref name=popular&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=Theodore|date=August 2004|title=For That Healthy Glow, Drink Radiation!|journal=Popular Science|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|volume=265|issue=2|page=28|issn=0161-7370}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recently [[quantum mechanics]] and [[grand unification theory]] have provided similar [[quantum mysticism|opportunities for commercial exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Athearn, D.

==Classification==

The term "energy medicine" has been in general use since the founding of the non-profit ''International Society for the Study of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine'' in the 1980s. Guides are available for practitioners, and other books aim to provide a theoretical basis and evidence for the practice. Energy medicine often proposes that imbalances in the body's "energy field" result in illness, and that by re-balancing the body's energy-field health can be restored.&lt;ref name="NCCAM"/&gt; Some modalities describe treatments as ridding the body of negative energies or blockages in 'mind'; illness or episodes of ill health after a treatment are referred to as a 'release' or letting go of a 'contraction' in the body-mind. Usually, a practitioner will then recommend further treatments for complete healing.

The US-based ''[[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]]'' (NCCIH) distinguishes between health care involving scientifically observable energy, which it calls "Veritable Energy Medicine", and health care methods that invoke physically undetectable or unverifiable [[energy (esotericism)|"energies"]], which it calls "Putative Energy Medicine":&lt;ref name=NCCAM&gt;{{cite web | year=2005 | url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/energymed.htm | title=Energy Medicine: An Overview | author=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Types of "veritable energy medicine" include [[magnet therapy]], [[colorpuncture]], and [[light therapy]]. Medical techniques involving the use electromagnetic radiation (''e.g.'' [[radiation therapy]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]]) are not considered "energy medicine" in the terms of alternative medicine.
* Types of "putative energy medicine" include biofield energy healing therapies where the hands are claimed to direct or modulate "energies" which are believed to effect healing in the patient;&lt;ref "name=warber"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Warber, S.

Polarity therapy founded by [[Randolph Stone]] is a kind of energy medicine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellnessinstitute.net/web/polarity_therapy|title=Polarity Therapy|publisher=Wellness Institute|accessdate=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the belief that a person's health is subject to positive and negative charges in their electromagnetic field.&lt;ref name=acs&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |title=American Cancer Society Complete Guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=9780944235713 |editors=Russell J, Rovere A |pages=235–237 |chapter=Polarity Therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been promoted as capable of curing a number of human ailments ranging from muscular tightness to cancer; however, according to the [[American Cancer Society]] "available scientific evidence does not support claims that polarity therapy is effective in treating cancer or any other disease".&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

==Beliefs==
[[File:Reiki-Treatment.jpg|thumb|A Reiki practitioner]]
Energy healing relies on a belief in the ability of a practitioner to channel healing energy into the person seeking help by different methods: hands-on,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; hands-off,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; and distant&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name="brockhampton"/&gt; (or absent) where the patient and healer are in different locations. The ''Brockhampton Guide to Spiritual Healing'' describes contact healing in terms of "transfer of ... healing energy" and distant healing based on visualising the patient in perfect health.&lt;ref name="brockhampton"/&gt; Practitioners say that this "healing energy" is sometimes perceived by the therapist as a feeling of heat.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/alternative_medicine/article4317985.ece|author=Jules Evans | title=Spiritual healing on the NHS? | publisher=The Times|date=July 14, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various schools of energy healing, including ''biofield energy healing'',&lt;ref name="mdanderson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="springerlink"/&gt; ''spiritual healing'',&lt;ref name="Ernst 2001 88–92"/&gt; ''contact healing'', ''distant healing'', ''[[therapeutic touch]]'',&lt;ref name="Therapeutic Touch"/&gt; ''[[Reiki]],''&lt;ref name="Reiki Practice"/&gt; ''[[Qigong]],'' and many others.&lt;ref name="mdanderson"/&gt;

''Spiritual healing'' is largely non-denominational; traditional religious faith is not seen as a prerequisite for effecting a cure. ''[[Faith healing]],'' by contrast, takes place within a religious context.&lt;ref name="What is healing"/&gt; The Buddha is often quoted by practitioners of energy medicine, but he did not practise "hands on or off" healing.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Energy healing techniques such as [[Therapeutic touch]] have found recognition in the nursing profession. In 2005–2006, the ''[[North American Nursing Diagnosis Association]]'' approved the diagnosis of "[[energy field disturbance]]" in patients, reflective of what has been variously called a "[[postmodernism|postmodern]]" or "anti-scientific" approach to nursing care. This approach has been strongly criticised.&lt;ref name=Glazer&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/postmodern-nursing|year=2000|title=Postmodern nursing | author=Sarah Glazer | work=National Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hammer&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hammer | first = Owen | authorlink = |author2=James Underdown  | title = State-Sponsored Quackery: Feng Shui and Snake Oil for California Nurses  | journal = [[Skeptical Inquirer]]  | volume = 33  | issue = 6  | pages = 53–56 | publisher = Committee for Skeptical Inquiry | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/state-sponsored_quackery_feng_shui_and_snake_oil_for_california_nurses/ | date = November–December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Junk&gt;[http://junkfoodscience.blogspot.com/2007/07/junkfood-science-special-trusting.html Junkfood Science Special: Trusting nurses with our lives] by Sandy Szwarc, BSN, RN, CCP.

Believers in these techniques have proposed [[Quantum mysticism|quantum mystical]] invocations of [[Quantum nonlocality|non-locality]] to try to explain distant healing.&lt;ref name=AAQM&gt;{{cite web | title=Some Notes on the American Academy of Quantum Medicine (AAQM) | author=Stephen Barrett | url=http://www.quackwatch.com/04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/aaqm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also proposed that healers act as a channel passing on a kind of [[bioelectromagnetism]] which shares similarities to [[vitalism|vitalistic]] [[pseudosciences]] such as [[orgone]] or [[qi]].&lt;ref name="stenger"&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Victor J.

Oschman believes that "healing energy" derives from [[frequency|electromagnetic frequencies]] generated by a medical device, projected from the hands of the healer, or by [[electron]]s acting as [[antioxidant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oschman|first1=James|title=Can Electrons Act as Antioxidants?

Physicists and sceptics roundly criticise these explanations as [[pseudophysics]]&amp;nbsp;– a branch of [[pseudoscience]] which explains [[magical thinking]] by using irrelevant jargon from modern physics to exploit [[scientific literacy|scientific illiteracy]] and to impress the unsophisticated.&lt;ref name=GistLubin&gt;{{cite book|title=Response to disaster: psychosocial, community, and ecological approaches in clinical and community psychology|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1999|isbn=0-87630-998-8|page=291|author1=Richard Gist |author2=Bernard Lubin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific investigations==

===Distant healing===

A systematic review of 23 trials of distant healing published in 2000 did not draw definitive conclusions because of the "methodologic limitations of several studies".&lt;ref name=Astin&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Efficacy of "Distant Healing: A Systematic Review of Randomized Trials|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|year=2000|last=Astin|first=J.|author2=et. al|volume=132|issue=11|pages=903–910 | url=http://www.annals.org/content/132/11/903.abstract|pmid=10836918|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-132-11-200006060-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the lead author of that study, [[Edzard Ernst]], published a primer on complementary therapies in cancer care in which he explained that though "about half of these trials suggested that healing is effective" he cautioned that the evidence was "highly conflicting" and that "methodological shortcomings prevented firm conclusions." He concluded that "as long as it is not used as an alternative to effective therapies, spiritual healing should be virtually devoid of risks."&lt;ref name="Ernst 2001 88–92" /&gt;  A 2001 randomised clinical trial by the same group found no statistically significant difference on chronic pain between distance healers and "simulated healers".&lt;ref name=Abbot&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0304-3959(00)00421-8 | last1=Abbot | title=Spiritual healing as a therapy for chronic pain: a randomized, clinical trial | first1=NC | last2=Harkness | first2=EF | last3=Stevinson | first3=C | last4=Marshall | first4=FP | last5=Conn | first5=DA | last6=Ernst | first6=E. |authorlink6=Edzard Ernst | author9=Abbot, NC, Harkness, EF, Stevinson, C, Marshall, FP, Conn, DA and Ernst, E. | journal=Pain | volume=91 | issue=1–2 | year=2001 | pages=79–89|pmid=11240080}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 review by Ernst updating previous work concluded that more recent research had shifted the weight of evidence "against the notion that distant healing is more than a placebo" and that "distant healing can be associated with adverse effects."&lt;ref name=Ernst2003&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF03040322 | author=Ernst E. |authorlink=Edzard Ernst | title=Distant healing—an update of a systematic review | journal=Wien Klin Wochenschr. | year=2003 | volume=115 | issue=7–8 | pages=241–245 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h852m82147632728/ | pmid=12778776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 randomised clinical trial randomly assigned 120 patients with chronic pain to either healers or "simulated healers", but could not demonstrate efficacy for either distance or face-to-face healing.&lt;ref name="Abbot"/&gt; A systematic review in 2008 concluded that the evidence for a specific effect of spiritual healing on relieving neuropathic or neuralgic pain was not convincing.&lt;ref name=Pittler&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1097/AJP.0b013e3181759231 | last1=Pittler | first1=MH | last2=Ernst | first2=E. |authorlink2=Edzard Ernst | author9=Pittler, MH.; Ernst, E. | title=Complementary Therapies for Neuropathic and Neuralgic Pain: Systematic Review | journal=Clinical Journal of Pain. | volume=24 | issue=8 | pages=731–733 | year=2008 | pmid=18806539}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2008 book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'', [[Simon Singh]] and [[Edzard Ernst]] concluded that "spiritual healing is biologically implausible and its effects rely on a placebo response.

===Evidence base===

Alternative medicine researcher Edzard Ernst has argued that although an initial review of pre-1999 distant healing trials&lt;ref name=Astin/&gt; had highlighted 57% of trials as showing positive results,&lt;ref name="Ernst 2001 88–92"/&gt; later reviews of non-randomised and randomised clinical trials conducted between 2000 and 2002&lt;ref name=Ernst2003/&gt; led to the conclusion that "the majority of the rigorous trials do not support the hypothesis that distant healing has specific therapeutic effects". Ernst described the evidence base for healing practices to be "increasingly negative".&lt;ref name=ernst2006&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2006.07.010 |title=Spiritual healing: more than meets the eye |author=Ernst E. |authorlink=Edzard Ernst |journal=J Pain Symptom Manage. |date=November 2006 |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=393–5 |pmid=17085260 | url=http://www.jpsmjournal.com/article/S0885-3924(06)00524-0/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst also warned that many of the reviews were under suspicion for fabricated data, lack of transparency, and scientific misconduct. He concluded that "[s]piritual healing continues to be promoted despite the absence of biological plausibility or convincing clinical evidence ... that these methods work therapeutically and plenty to demonstrate that they do not."&lt;ref name=ernst2006/&gt; A 2014 study of energy healing for colorectal cancer patients showed no improvement in quality of life, depressive symptoms, mood, or sleep quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=CG Pedersen |author2=H Johannessen |author3=JV Hjelmborg |author4=R Zachariae |title=Effectiveness of energy healing on Quality of Life: a pragmatic intervention trial in colorectal cancer patients|journal=Complementary Therapies in Medicine|date=June 2014|volume=22|issue=3|pages=463–72|pmid=24906586|doi=10.1016/j.ctim.2014.04.003}}&lt;!--|accessdate=August 5, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative explanations for positive reports==
There are several, primarily psychological, explanations for positive reports after energy therapy, including [[placebo effect]]s, [[spontaneous remission]], and [[cognitive dissonance]]. A 2009 review found that the "small successes" reported for two therapies collectively marketed as "energy psychology" ([[Emotional Freedom Techniques]] and [[Tapas Acupressure Technique]]) "are potentially attributable to well-known cognitive and behavioral techniques that are included with the energy manipulation." The report concluded that "[p]sychologists and researchers should be wary of using such techniques, and make efforts to inform the public about the ill effects of therapies that advertise miraculous claims."&lt;ref name=McCaslin&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Psychotherapy (Chicago) |date=June 2009 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=249–56 |title=A review of efficacy claims in energy psychology |author=McCaslin DL |pmid=22122622 |doi=10.1037/a0016025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are primarily two explanations for anecdotes of cures or improvements, relieving any need to appeal to the supernatural.&lt;ref name='USDMoores1'&gt;{{Cite news| title=Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Cancer Patients: Faith Healing | publisher=Moores UCSD Cancer Center | url =http://cancer.ucsd.edu/Outreach/PublicEducation/CAMs/faith.asp | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-17 | language = }} "Benefits may result because of the natural progression of the illness, rarely but regularly occurring spontaneous remission or through the placebo effect."&lt;/ref&gt; The first is ''[[post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'', meaning that a genuine improvement or [[spontaneous remission]] may have been experienced coincidental with but independent from anything the healer or patient did or said. These patients would have improved just as well even had they done nothing. The second is the [[placebo]] effect, through which a person may experience genuine pain relief and other symptomatic alleviation. In this case, the patient genuinely has been helped by the healer{{spaced ndash}} not through any mysterious or numinous function, but by the power of their own belief that they would be healed.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Park | first = Robert L. | authorlink = Robert L. Park | title = Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2000 | location = New York City | pages = 50–51 | isbn = 0-19-513515-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='USDMoores2'&gt;{{Cite news| title=Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Cancer Patients: Faith Healing | publisher=Moores UCSD Cancer Center | url =http://cancer.ucsd.edu/Outreach/PublicEducation/CAMs/faith.asp | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-17 | language = }} "Patients who seek the assistance of a faith healer must believe strongly in the healer's divine gifts and ability to focus them on the ill."&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases the patient may experience a real reduction in symptoms, though in neither case has anything miraculous or inexplicable occurred. Both cases, are strictly limited to the body's natural abilities.

Positive findings from research studies can also result from such psychological mechanisms, or as a result of [[experimenter bias]], methodological flaws such as lack of [[Blind experiment|blinding]],&lt;ref name=McCaslin/&gt; or [[publication bias]]; positive reviews of the scientific literature may show [[selection bias]], in that they omit key studies that do not agree with the author's position.&lt;ref name=McCaslin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pignotti&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pignotti, M.  |author2=Thyer, B. | year=2009 | title=Some comments on "Energy psychology: A review of the evidence": Premature conclusions based on incomplete evidence? | journal=Psychotherapy: Research, Practice, Training | volume=46 | pages=257–261 | doi = 10.1037/a0016027 | issue = 2 | pmid=22122623}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these factors must be considered when evaluating claims.

==Bioresonance therapy==
'''Bioresonance therapy''' (including '''MORA therapy''') is a [[pseudoscientific]] medical practice in which it is proposed that [[electromagnetic wave]]s can be used to diagnose and treat human illness.&lt;ref name="Ernst 2004 171-173"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ernst E. |authorlink=Edzard Ernst |title=Bioresonance, a study of pseudo-scientific language |journal=Forsch Komplementärmed Klass Naturheilkd |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=171–173 |date=June 2004  |pmid=15249751 |doi=10.1159/000079446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History and method===
Bioresonance therapy was invented in (Germany) in 1977 by Franz Morell and his son-in-law, engineer Erich Rasche. Initially they marketed it as "MORA-Therapie", for MOrell and RAsche. Some of the machines contain an electronic circuit measuring skin-resistance, akin to the [[E-meter]] used by [[Scientology]], which the bioresonance creators sought to improve; Franz Morell had links with Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ|url=http://www.bioenergeticmedicine.org/CoRe-System/Main/FAQ.htm|website=www.bioenergeticmedicine.org|accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=February 2014}}{{cite web

Practitioners claim to be able to detect a variety of diseases and addictions. Some practitioners also claim they can treat diseases using this therapy without drugs, by stimulating a change of "bioresonance" in the cells, and reversing the change caused by the disease. The devices would need to be able to isolate and pinpoint pathogens' responses from the mixture of responses the device receives via the electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficacy Study into Bioresonance Therapy|url=https://bioresonance.com/efficacy-study-into-bioresonance-therapy-slides/|publisher=Bioresonance.com|accessdate=November 27, 2016|date=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmitting these transformed signals over the same electrodes is claimed by practitioners to generate healing signals that have the curative effect.&lt;ref name=qw /&gt;

===Effectiveness===
One placebo-controlled study of the effects of bioresonance therapy showed that "MORA bioresonance therapy can markedly improve non-organic gastro-intestinal complaints."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nienhaus J, Galle M |title=[Placebo-controlled study of the effects of a standardized MORA bioresonance therapy on functional gastrointestinal complaints] |language=German |journal=Forsch Komplementärmed |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=28–34 |year=2006 |doi=10.1159/000090134 |pmid=16582548}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research study, however, was conducted with a relatively small sample size of 20 people and published by a journal that exclusively publishes "alternative medicine" procedures. The bioresonance diagnosis was complemented by the practitioner's dietary suggestions, making for an uncontrolled experiment with no analytical methods. The only measuring methods present were the subjective analysis of the practitioner pre and post diagnosis.

===Scientific criticism===
Lacking any scientific explanation of how bioresonance therapy might work, researchers have classified bioresonance therapy as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Galle M |title=[Bioresonance, a study of pseudo-scientific language] |language=German |journal=Forsch Komplementärmed Klass Naturheilkd |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=306; author reply 306 |date=October 2004 |doi=10.1159/000082152 |pmid=15580708 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[Science|scientific]] studies did not show effects above that of the [[placebo effect]].&lt;ref name=Wuth16047707&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wüthrich B |title=Unproven techniques in allergy diagnosis |journal=J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=86–90 |year=2005 |pmid=16047707 |url=http://www.centropediatrico.ch/Data/w%C3%BCthrich%20unproven%20techniques%20in%20allergy.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512182250/http://www.centropediatrico.ch/Data/w%C3%BCthrich%20unproven%20techniques%20in%20allergy.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000237460 |vauthors=Schöni MH, Nikolaizik WH, Schöni-Affolter F |title=Efficacy trial of bioresonance in children with atopic dermatitis |journal= Int Arch Allergy Immunol |volume=112 |issue=3 |pages =238–46 |date=March 1997 |pmid=9066509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WebMD]] states: "There is no reliable scientific evidence that bioresonance is an accurate indicator of medical conditions or disease or an effective treatment for any condition."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Proven cases of online fraud have occurred,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news02/biores.html "BioResonance" Promoter Settles Charges]&lt;/ref&gt; with a practitioner making false claims that he had the ability to cure cancer, and that his clients did not need to follow the chemotherapy or surgery recommended by medical doctors, which can be life-saving.  [[Ben Goldacre]] ridiculed the [[BBC]] when it reported as fact a clinic's claim that the treatment had the ability to stop 70% of clients smoking, a better result than any conventional therapy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/nov/12/badscience.uknews Who's holding a smoking gun to bioresonance?]
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States of America the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) classifies "devices that use resistance measurements to diagnose and treat various diseases" as Class III devices, which require FDA approval prior to marketing. The FDA has banned some of these devices from the US market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Alan E. Smith | title = UnBreak Your Health: The Complete Guide to Complementary &amp; Alternative Therapies | publisher = Loving Healing Press | year = 2007 | pages = 29 | isbn = 1-932690-36-0 | chapter = Bioresonance Therapy (BRT) | chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=04Vfb6iS65wC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=29&amp;dq=Unbreak+Your+Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has prosecuted many sellers of electrical devices for making false claims of health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Genital herpes''' is an infection by [[herpes simplex virus]] (HSV) of the [[Sex organ|genitals]].&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt; Most people either have no or mild symptoms and thus do not know they are infected.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt; When symptoms do occur, they typically include small [[blister]]s that break open to form painful [[ulcers]].&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt; [[Flu-like symptoms]], such as fever, aching, or swollen [[Lymph node|lymph nodes]], may also occur.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Bas/&gt; Onset is typically around 4 days after exposure with symptoms lasting up to 4 weeks.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt; Once infected further outbreaks may occur but are generally milder.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/STDFact-herpes-detailed.htm| title=Genital Herpes – CDC Fact Sheet|date=9 February 2017|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The disease is typically spread by direct genital contact with the skin surface or secretions of someone who is infected.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt; This may occur during [[sex]], including [[Anal sex|anal]] and [[oral sex]].&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt; Sores are not required for transmission to occur.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt; The risk of spread between a couple is about 7.5% over a year.&lt;ref name=IQ2018&gt;{{Cite journal|last=pmhdev|first=|date=December 12, 2012|title=Genital herpes: How can you prevent the spread of herpes in sexual relationships?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0100234/|journal=PubMed Health|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HSV is classified into two types, HSV-1 and HSV-2.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt; While historically mostly cause by HSV-2, genital HSV-1 has become more common in the [[developed world]].&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Beigi|editor-first=Richard H.|title=Sexually transmitted diseases|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=9781118314975|pages=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KrynOvt34jAC&amp;pg=PA139|date=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis may occur by testing lesions using either [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] or [[viral culture]] or [[blood tests]] for specific [[antibodies]].&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Efforts to prevent infection include not having sex, using [[condoms]], and only having sex with someone who is not infected.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Bas&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/Herpes/STDFact-Herpes.htm|title=STD Facts – Genital Herpes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once infected, there is no cure.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Bas/&gt; [[Antiviral medications]] may, however, prevent outbreaks or shorten outbreaks if they occur.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt; The long term use of antivirals may also decrease the risk of further spread.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and prognosis --&gt;
In 2015 about 846 million people (12% of the world population), had genital herpes.&lt;ref name=GBD2015Pre&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence|first1=Collaborators.|title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 310 diseases and injuries, 1990-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.|journal=Lancet|date=8 October 2016|volume=388|issue=10053|pages=1545–1602|pmid=27733282|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31678-6|pmc=5055577}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, more than one-in-six people have HSV-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/stdfact-herpes.htm|title=STD Facts - Genital Herpes|last=|first=|date=December 11, 2017|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 22, 2018|quote=Genital herpes is common in the United States. More than one out of every six people aged 14 to 49 years have genital herpes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are more commonly infected than men.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt; Rates of disease caused by HSV-2 have decreased in the United States between 1990 and 2010.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt; Complications may rarely include [[aseptic meningitis]], an increased risk of [[HIV/AIDS]] if exposed to [[HIV-positive people|HIV-positive]] individuals, and spread to the baby during [[childbirth]] resulting in [[neonatal herpes]].&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:SOA-Herpes-genitalis-male.jpg|thumb|Genital herpes affecting the penis]]
In males, the lesions occur on the [[glans penis]], shaft of the penis or other parts of the genital region, on the inner thigh, buttocks, or [[Human anus|anus]]. In females, lesions appear on or near the [[Mons pubis|pubis]], [[clitoris]] or other parts of the [[vulva]], buttocks or anus.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Bas/&gt;

Other common symptoms include pain, itching, and burning. Less frequent, yet still common, symptoms include discharge from the penis or [[vagina]], [[fever]], [[headache]], muscle pain ([[myalgia]]), swollen and enlarged lymph nodes and [[malaise]].&lt;ref name="pmid18156035"/&gt; Women often experience additional symptoms that include painful urination ([[dysuria]]) and [[cervicitis]]. Herpetic [[proctitis]] (inflammation of the anus and rectum) is common for individuals participating in [[Anal sex|anal intercourse]].&lt;ref name="pmid18156035"/&gt;

After 2–3 weeks, existing lesions progress into ulcers and then crust and heal, although lesions on mucosal surfaces may never form crusts.&lt;ref name="pmid18156035"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gupta R, Warren T, Wald A | title = Genital herpes | journal = Lancet | volume = 370 | issue = 9605 | pages = 2127–37 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18156035 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61908-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases, involvement of the [[sacrum|sacral]] region of the [[spinal cord]] can cause acute [[urinary retention]] and one-sided symptoms and signs of  myeloradiculitis (a combination of [[myelitis]] and [[radiculitis]]): pain, sensory loss, abnormal sensations ([[paresthesia]]) and rash.&lt;ref name="pmid16680560"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sakakibara R, Yamanishi T, Uchiyama T, Hattori T | title = Acute urinary retention due to benign inflammatory nervous diseases | journal = Journal of Neurology | volume = 253 | issue = 8 | pages = 1103–10 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16680560 | doi = 10.1007/s00415-006-0189-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8277988"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vonk P | title = [Elsberg syndrome: acute urinary retention following a viral infection] | language = Dutch, Flemish | journal = Nederlands Tijdschrift Voor Geneeskunde | volume = 137 | issue = 50 | pages = 2603–5 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 8277988 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, this has been termed Elsberg syndrome, although this entity is not clearly defined.&lt;ref name="pmid16680560"/&gt; 

===Recurrence===
After a first episode of herpes genitalis caused by [[Herpes simplex virus|HSV-2]], there will be at least one recurrence in approximately 80% of people, while the recurrence rate for herpes genitalis caused by [[HSV-1]] is approximately 50%.&lt;ref name=nz/&gt; Herpes genitalis caused by HSV-2 recurs on average four to six times per year, while that of HSV-1 infection occurs only about once per year.&lt;ref name=nz&gt;[http://www.herpes.org.nz/patient-info/all-facts/ How the facts about Genital Herpes can help]. By New Zealand Herpes Foundation. Retrieved June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

People with recurrent genital herpes may be treated with ''suppressive therapy'', which consists of daily antiviral treatment using acyclovir, valacyclovir or famciclovir.&lt;ref name=Cochrane2014/&gt; Suppressive therapy may be useful in those who have at least four recurrences per year but the quality of the evidence is poor.&lt;ref name=Cochrane2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Le Cleach L, Trinquart L, Do G, Maruani A, Lebrun-Vignes B, Ravaud P, Chosidow O | title = Oral antiviral therapy for prevention of genital herpes outbreaks in immunocompetent and nonpregnant patients | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = CD009036 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25086573 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009036.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People with lower rates of recurrence will probably also have fewer recurrences with suppressive therapy.&lt;ref name=bashh2007&gt;[http://www.bashh.org/documents/115/115.pdf 2007 National Guideline for the Management of Genital Herpes.] By Clinical Effectiveness Group at British Association for Sexual Health and HIV.&lt;/ref&gt; Suppressive therapy should be discontinued after a maximum of one year to reassess recurrence frequency.&lt;ref name=bashh2007/&gt;

==Transmission==
Genital herpes can be spread by [[viral shedding]] prior to and following the formation of ulcers. The risk of spread between a couple is about 7.5% over a year (for unprotected sex).&lt;ref name=IQ2018 /&gt; The likelihood of transferring genital herpes from one person to another is decreased by [[Safe sex|male condom use]] by 50%, by [[female condom]] by 50%, and refraining from sex during an active outbreak.&lt;ref name=IQ2018 /&gt; The longer a partner has had the infection, the lower the transmission rate.&lt;ref name=IQ2018 /&gt; An infected person may further decrease transmission risks by maintaining a daily dose of antiviral medications.&lt;ref name=IQ2018 /&gt; Infection by genital herpes occurs in about 1 in every 1,000 sexual acts.&lt;ref name=IQ2018 /&gt;

==Screening==
Testing peoples' blood, including those who are pregnant, who do not have symptoms for HSV is not recommended.&lt;ref name=JAMA2016USPSTF/&gt; This is due to concerns of greater harm than benefit, as there is a high false-positive rate and receiving a positive test result can cause other problems, such as relationship difficulties.&lt;ref name=JAMA2016USPSTF&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bibbins-Domingo K, Grossman DC, Curry SJ, Davidson KW, Epling JW, García FA, Kemper AR, Krist AH, Kurth AE, Landefeld CS, Mangione CM, Phillips WR, Phipps MG, Pignone MP, Silverstein M, Tseng CW | display-authors = 6 | title = Serologic Screening for Genital Herpes Infection: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement | journal = Jama | volume = 316 | issue = 23 | pages = 2525–2530 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27997659 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2016.16776 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Once infected, there is no cure.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Bas/&gt; [[Antiviral medications]], such as [[acyclovir]], [[valacyclovir]], may prevent outbreaks or shorten outbreaks if they occur.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt; The long term use of antivirals may also decrease the risk of further spread.&lt;ref name=CDC2017Fact/&gt; The longer a person has the virus, the less outbreak they experience and the harder it will be to transmit to others, due to these specialty antigens and a strengthened immune system response.&lt;ref name="CDC2017Bas3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/Herpes/STDFact-Herpes.htm|title=STD Facts – Genital Herpes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acyclovir is an [[antiviral medication]] and reduces the pain and the number of lesions in the initial case of genital herpes. Furthermore, it decreases the frequency and severity of recurrent infections. It comes in [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], [[Injection (medicine)|injection]], powder for injection, and [[ointment]]. The ointment is used topically and it decreases pain, reduces healing time, and limits the spread of the infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/acyclovir/article.htm|title=Medications and Drugs|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valacyclovir is a prodrug that is converted to acyclovir once in the body. It helps relieve the pain and discomfort and speeds healing of sores. It only comes in caplets and its advantage is that it has a longer duration of action than acyclovir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/valacyclovir/article.htm|title=Brand Name: Valtrex|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example usage is by mouth twice per day for ten days for primary lesion, and twice per day for three days for a recurrent episode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/sti-its/cgsti-ldcits/section-5-4-eng.php Canadian Guidelines on Sexually Transmitted Infections &gt; Section 5 - Management and Treatment of Specific Infections &gt; Genital Herpes simplex virus (HSV) Infections.] from the Public Health Agency of Canada. Date Modified: 2013-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famciclovir is another antiviral drug that belongs to the same class. Famciclovir is a [[prodrug]] that is converted to penciclovir in the [[Human body|body]]. The latter is the one active against the viruses. It has a longer duration of action than acyclovir and it only comes in tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/famciclovir/article.htm|title=Brand Name: Famvir|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
About 16 percent of Americans between the ages of 14 and 49 are infected with genital herpes, making it one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/03/09/ps-herpes-usa-idUSN0923528620100309| title=U.S. herpes rates remain high - CDC|date=2010-03-09|access-date=2013-05-03|work=Reuters|first=JoAnne|last=Allen | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 80% of those infected are unaware of their infection.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/STDFact-herpes-detailed.htm| title=Genital Herpes - CDC Fact Sheet|date=|access-date=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately, 776,000 people in the United States get new herpes infections every year.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

Tests for herpes are not routinely included among STD screenings. Performers in the [[pornography industry]] are screened for HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea with an optional panel of tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis, but not herpes. Testing for herpes is controversial since the results are not always accurate or helpful.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/05/19/std.protection.ep/| title=Prevent STDs like a porn star|date=2011-05-19|access-date=2013-11-04|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most sex workers and performers will contract herpes at some point in their careers whether they use protection or not.&lt;ref name="Good"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.good.is/posts/sore-subject-the-symptoms-of-herpes-aren-t-just-physical| title=Sore Subject: The Symptoms of Herpes Aren't Just Physical|date=|access-date=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early 20th century public health legislation in the United Kingdom required compulsory treatment for sexually transmitted diseases but did not include herpes because it was not serious enough.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spiked-online.com/2011/09/01/the-courts-should-keep-out-of-our-sex-lives/|title=The courts should keep out of our sex lives|last=Scott|first=Nigel|date=1 September 2011|work=Spiked|access-date=30 October 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1975, nursing textbooks did not include herpes as it was considered no worse than a common cold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After the development of [[acyclovir]] in the 1970s, the drug company [[Burroughs Wellcome]] launched an extensive marketing campaign that publicized the illness, including creating victim's support groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Research==
{{Main|Herpes simplex research}}
There are efforts to develop a [[vaccine]] for active outbreaks of the virus–despite most cases being asymptomatic–but the results thus far have not been able to do so or eliminate transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hofstetter AM, Rosenthal SL, Stanberry LR | title = Current thinking on genital herpes | journal = Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–83 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24335720 | doi = 10.1097/qco.0000000000000029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4830">The '''Kent State University College of Public Health''' was established in 2009. It is one of only two colleges of [[public health]] in [[Ohio]], and it is the first school in the state to offer a [[Bachelor of Science in Public Health]] [http://www.kent.edu/publichealth/].  Its goal is to train students to meet the current and projected shortage of public health professionals across the nation.

The College of Public Health is built on the Academic Health Department model [http://www.kent.edu/publichealth/about.cfm]  which fosters [[collaboration]] between schools and local public health agencies to combine academic scholarship and public health practice. To implement the model, the College partners with local [[health department]]s, community organizations, health care institutions and businesses to give students the opportunity to take part in real-world learning experiences.

==Degree &amp; Certificate Programs==

The College of Public Health offers a variety of degree and certificate programs at both the [[undergraduate]] and [[Graduate school|graduate]] levels:

*The '''undergraduate public health certificate''' is an 18-credit hour certificate that provides an introduction to the major public health disciplines [http://www.kent.edu/publichealth/certificates.cfm].
*The '''Bachelor of Science in Public Health''' requires students to complete 121 hours of required courses, public health concentration courses and approved electives, as well as an [[internship]]. Students enrolled in this program can choose from seven concentrations: Health Service Administration, Health Promotion and Education, Global Health, Allied Health, Prevention and Preparedness, Pre-Medicine, and Environmental/Sanitation [http://www.kent.edu/publichealth/undergraduate/index.cfm].
*The '''[[Masters in Public Health]]''' is a 45-credit hour program organized into five curricular domains. Students can choose to specialize in one of five areas: [[Epidemiology]], [[Biostatistics]], Environmental Health Sciences, Social and Behavioral Sciences and Health Policy and Management. [http://www.kent.edu/publichealth/graduate/mph/index.cfm].
*The '''Doctorate in Public Health''' gives students the opportunity to earn their Ph.D. in Public Health with a specialization in Prevention Science, Epidemiology, or Health Policy and Management. [http://www.kent.edu/publichealth/graduate/doctoral-programs.cfm].

[[Kent State University|Kent State]]’s College of Public Health also offers a variety of graduate assistantships for students pursuing their Master’s and Doctoral degrees.

==Faculty Information==

At the present time Kent State’s College of Public Health has 18 full-time faculty members who operate across five disciplines: epidemiology, biostatistics, [[environmental health]] sciences, [[Social science|social]] and [[behavioral science]]s and [[health policy]] and management. They have an established record of grant-funded scholarship and research, and throughout their careers have accumulated a total of $29 million in externally funded research [http://www.kent.edu/publichealth/about.cfm].

Faculty members in the College of Public Health regularly engage in research that aims to provide solutions for societal problems such as preventing [[violence]], responding to natural and manmade disasters, curbing [[substance abuse]], and improving the delivery of healthcare.

==Student Alliance==

The Public Health Student Alliance (P.H.S.A.)[http://www.kent.edu/publichealth/phsa/about.cfm] at Kent State operates as the central student association and coordinating organization for the College of Public Health. Membership is open to any student interested in Public Health, and the overall mission is to improve society’s [[quality of life]]. To become a member a student must fill out an application form and pay dues of $5.00/semester or $10/year.

P.H.S.A sponsors the College’s Speaker Series [http://www.kent.edu/publichealth/speakerseries/index.cfm], which brings in industry professionals, professors and researchers to talk about important issues within the public health arena.

==Advising Department==

The College of Public Health has its own advising department solely for students who are interested in pursuing a degree in public health. Students can schedule an individual advising appointment to ask questions, get additional information and receive assistance filling out forms.

== Accreditation==

The College of Public Health is seeking accreditation through the Council on Education for Public Health as a full school. [http://www.ceph.org/]. On October 26, 2012 the College was announced as an Associate Member in the Association of Schools of Public Health. The College is currently in its self-study period.

The {{Nihongo|'''Matsuoka Hoyoen Sanatorium'''|国立療養所松丘保養園|Kokuritsuryōyōjo Matsuokahoyōen}} or '''National Sanatorium Matsuoka Hoyoen''' is a [[sanatorium]] for [[leprosy]] and ex-leprosy patients situated in [[Aomori, Aomori]], Japan that opened in 1909.

==History==
The Japanese Government promulgated the first leprosy prevention law on March 19, 1907, which took effect on April 1, 1909. [[Japan]] was divided into 5 areas. The second area included [[Hokkaido]], [[Miyagi Prefecture]], [[Iwate Prefecture]], [[Aomori Prefecture]], [[Fukushima Prefecture]], [[Yamagata Prefecture]] and [[Akita Prefecture]]. In this area, [[Aomori, Aomori|Aomori]] was selected for the sanatorium.

Foreigners who came into Japan after the [[Meiji Restoration]](1868) were surprised to find leprosy patients in public areas in Japan. The Japanese Government was worried about the many leprosy patients among those who were examined for the draft at age 20.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Leprosy History(1993) Shun-ichi Yamamoto. University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo, in Japanese&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline===
* April 1, 1909: Prefectural Hokubu (Northern) Hoyoin was established in Aburakawa Village [[Aomori (city)|Aomori]]-shi with 90 beds.
* October 1, 1909: It moved to the present site.
* July 1, 1941: National Sanatorium Matsuoka Hoyo-en.
* 1958: The number of allotted beds reached 950.
* April 1996: The 1953 Leprosy Prevention Law was abolished.
* July 1998: The trial for compensation started.
* May 11, 2001: The trial for compensation ruled that the previous Leprosy Prevention Law was unconstitutional.
* May 25, 2001: The trial for compensation was completed. Compensation of 8-14 million yen were given to patients depending on the duration of their confinement.

&lt;!-- Definition and medical uses --&gt;
'''Medical cannabis''', or '''medical marijuana''', is [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[cannabinoid]]s that are recommended by doctors for their patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Murnion B |title= Medicinal cannabis |journal= Australian Prescriber |volume= 38 |issue= 6 |pages= 212–5 |date= Dec 2015 |pmid= 26843715 |pmc= 4674028 |doi= 10.18773/austprescr.2015.072 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= What is medical marijuana? |url = https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana-medicine |website= National Institute of Drug Abuse |access-date= 19 April 2016 |date = July 2015 |quote= The term medical marijuana refers to using the whole unprocessed marijuana plant or its basic extracts to treat a disease or symptom. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of cannabis as medicine has not been rigorously tested due to production restrictions and other governmental regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=  |title= Release the strains |journal= Nature Medicine |volume= 21 |issue=9 |page= 963 |date= September 2015 |pmid= 26340110 |doi= 10.1038/nm.3946 |url= http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v21/n9/full/nm.3946.html |access-date = 8 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited evidence suggests that cannabis can reduce nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy, improve appetite in people with [[HIV/AIDS]], and reduce chronic pain and muscle spasms.&lt;ref name=Borgelt2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JAMA2015 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Jensen B, Chen J, Furnish T, Wallace M |title= Medical Marijuana and Chronic Pain: a Review of Basic Science and Clinical Evidence |journal= Current Pain and Headache Reports |volume= 19 |issue=10 |pages=50 |date= October 2015 |pmid= 26325482 |doi= 10.1007/s11916-015-0524-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Side effects --&gt;
Short-term use increases the risk of minor and major adverse effects.&lt;ref name=JAMA2015 /&gt; Common side effects include dizziness, feeling tired, vomiting, and hallucinations.&lt;ref name=JAMA2015 /&gt; Long-term effects of cannabis are not clear.&lt;ref name=JAMA2015 /&gt; Concerns include memory and cognition problems, risk of addiction, [[schizophrenia]] in young people, and the risk of children taking it by accident.&lt;ref name=Borgelt2013 /&gt;

The ''Cannabis'' plant has a history of medicinal use dating back thousands of years in many cultures.&lt;ref name=BenAmar2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ben Amar M |title= Cannabinoids in medicine: A review of their therapeutic potential |journal= Journal of Ethnopharmacology |volume= 105 |issue=1-2 |pages=1–25 |date= April 2006 |pmid= 16540272 |doi= 10.1016/j.jep.2006.02.001 |type= Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of medical organizations have requested removal of cannabis from the list of Schedule I controlled substances, followed by regulatory and scientific review.&lt;ref name="ANA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AAFP" /&gt; Others oppose its legalization, such as the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]].&lt;ref name="AAP" /&gt;

Medical cannabis can be administered through a variety of methods, including capsules, lozenges, tinctures, dermal patches, oral or dermal sprays, [[cannabis edible]]s, and vaporizing or smoking dried buds. Synthetic cannabinoids are available for prescription use in some countries, such as [[dronabinol]] and [[nabilone]]. Countries that allow the medical use of whole-plant cannabis include Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Portugal, and Uruguay. In the United States, 33 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for medical purposes, beginning with California in 1996.  Although cannabis remains prohibited for any use at the federal level, the [[Rohrabacher–Farr amendment]] was enacted in December 2014, limiting the ability of federal law to be enforced in states where medical cannabis has been legalized.

== Classification ==

Many different cannabis strains are collectively called ''medical cannabis''. Since many varieties of the cannabis plant and plant derivatives all share the same name, the term medical cannabis is ambiguous and can be misunderstood. A Cannabis plant includes more than 400 different chemicals, of which about 70 are [[cannabinoid]]s.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports April 2016"&gt;{{cite web |author1 = Consumer Reports |title= Up in Smoke: Does Medical Marijuana Work? |url= http://www.consumerreports.org/medical-marijuana/does-medical-marijuana-work/ |website = Consumer Reports |access-date = 24 May 2016 |date= 28 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, typical government-approved medications contain only one or two  chemicals.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports April 2016" /&gt; The number of active chemicals in cannabis is one reason why treatment with cannabis is difficult to classify and study.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports April 2016" /&gt;

A 2014 review stated that the variations in ratio of CBD-to-THC in botanical and pharmaceutical preparations determines the therapeutic vs psychoactive effects (CBD attenuates THC's psychoactive effects&lt;ref name="Schubart et al.2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Schubart CD, Sommer IE, Fusar-Poli P, de Witte L, Kahn RS, Boks MP |title= Cannabidiol as a potential treatment for psychosis |journal= European Neuropsychopharmacology |volume= 24 |issue=1 |pages= 51–64 |date= January 2014 |pmid= 24309088 |doi= 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2013.11.002 |url= http://cannabisclinicians.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CBD-psychosis-2013.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;) of cannabis products.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Koppel BS, Brust JC, Fife T, Bronstein J, Youssof S, Gronseth G, Gloss D |title= Systematic review: efficacy and safety of medical marijuana in selected neurologic disorders: report of the Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology |journal= Neurology |volume= 82 |issue=17 |pages= 1556–63 |date= April 2014 |pmid= 24778283 |pmc= 4011465 |doi= 10.1212/WNL.0000000000000363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical uses ==

[[File:Cannabis sativa (Köhler).jpg|thumb|right|''Cannabis'' as illustrated in Köhler's ''Book of Medicinal Plants'', 1897]]

Medical cannabis has several potential beneficial effects.&lt;ref name=JAMA2015 /&gt; Evidence is moderate that it helps in [[chronic pain]] and [[spasticity|muscle spasms]].&lt;ref name=JAMA2015 /&gt; Low quality evidence suggests its use for reducing [[antiemetic|nausea]] during [[chemotherapy]], improving appetite in [[HIV/AIDS]], improving sleep, and improving [[tic]]s in [[Tourette syndrome]].&lt;ref name=JAMA2015&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Whiting PF, Wolff RF, Deshpande S, Di Nisio M, Duffy S, Hernandez AV, Keurentjes JC, Lang S, Misso K, Ryder S, Schmidlkofer S, Westwood M, Kleijnen J |title= Cannabinoids for Medical Use: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis |journal= JAMA |volume= 313 |issue= 24 |pages= 2456–73 |date= 23 June 2015 |pmid= 26103030 |doi= 10.1001/jama.2015.6358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When usual treatments are ineffective, [[cannabinoid]]s have also been recommended for anorexia, arthritis, migraine, and glaucoma.&lt;ref name="Sachs et al. 2015" /&gt;

It is recommended that cannabis use be stopped in [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=  |title= Committee Opinion No. 637: Marijuana Use During Pregnancy and Lactation |journal= Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume= 126 |issue=1 |pages= 234–8 |date= July 2015 |pmid= 26241291 |doi= 10.1097/01.AOG.0000467192.89321.a6 |url= http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/2015/07000/Committee_Opinion_No__637___Marijuana_Use_During.48.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nausea and vomiting ===

Medical cannabis is somewhat effective in [[chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting]] (CINV)&lt;ref name=Borgelt2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sachs et al. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Sachs J, McGlade E, Yurgelun-Todd D |title= Safety and Toxicology of Cannabinoids |journal= Neurotherapeutics |volume= 12 |issue=4 |pages= 735–46 |date= October 2015 |pmid= 26269228 |pmc= 4604177 |doi= 10.1007/s13311-015-0380-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be a reasonable option in those who do not improve following preferential treatment.&lt;ref name=Grotenhermen2012 /&gt; Comparative studies have found cannabinoids to be more effective than some conventional antiemetics such as [[prochlorperazine]], [[promethazine]], and [[metoclopramide]] in controlling CINV,&lt;ref name=Bowels2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Bowles DW, O'Bryant CL, Camidge DR, Jimeno A | title= The intersection between cannabis and cancer in the United States |journal= Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology |volume= 83 |issue=1 |pages= 1–10 |date= July 2012 |pmid= 22019199 |doi=10.1016/j.critrevonc.2011.09.008 |type= Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; but these are used less frequently because of side effects including dizziness, dysphoria, and hallucinations.&lt;ref name=Wang2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang T, Collet JP, Shapiro S, Ware MA |title= Adverse effects of medical cannabinoids: a systematic review |journal= CMAJ |volume= 178 |issue= 13 |pages= 1669–78 |date= June 2008 |pmid= 18559804 |pmc= 2413308 |doi= 10.1503/cmaj.071178 |type= Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jordan2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Jordan K, Sippel C, Schmoll HJ |title= Guidelines for antiemetic treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: past, present, and future recommendations |journal= The Oncologist |volume= 12 |issue=9 |pages= 1143–50 |date= September 2007 |pmid= 17914084 |doi= 10.1634/theoncologist.12-9-1143 |url= http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/12/9/1143.long |type= Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term cannabis use may cause nausea and vomiting, a condition known as [[cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome]].&lt;ref name=Nicolson2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Nicolson SE, Denysenko L, Mulcare JL, Vito JP, Chabon B | title = Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: a case series and review of previous reports | journal = Psychosomatics |volume= 53 |issue= 3 |pages= 212–9 |date= May–Jun 2012 |pmid= 22480624 |doi= 10.1016/j.psym.2012.01.003 |type= Review, case series }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane review]] said that cannabinoids were "probably effective" in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea in children, but with a high side-effect profile (mainly drowsiness, dizziness, altered moods, and increased appetite). Less common side effects were "ocular problems, orthostatic hypotension, muscle twitching, pruritis, vagueness, hallucinations, lightheadedness and dry mouth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips RS, Friend AJ, Gibson F, Houghton E, Gopaul S, Craig JV, Pizer B | title = Antiemetic medication for prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in childhood | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD007786 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26836199 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007786.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS ===

Evidence is lacking for both efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids in treating patients with HIV/AIDS or for anorexia associated with AIDS. As of 2013, current studies suffer from effects of bias, small sample size, and lack of long-term data.&lt;ref name=Lutge2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lutge EE, Gray A, Siegfried N | title = The medical use of cannabis for reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV/AIDS | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = CD005175 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23633327 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005175.pub3 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pain ===

A 2017 review found only limited evidence for the effectiveness of cannabis in relieving chronic pain in several conditions.&lt;ref name="aviram"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aviram J, Samuelly-Leichtag G | title = Efficacy of Cannabis-Based Medicines for Pain Management: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials | journal = Pain Physician | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = E755-E796 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28934780 | url = http://www.painphysicianjournal.com/current/pdf?article=NDYwNA%3D%3D&amp;journal=107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review found tentative evidence for use of cannabis in treating [[peripheral neuropathy]], but little evidence of benefit for other types of long term pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nugent SM, Morasco BJ, O'Neil ME, Freeman M, Low A, Kondo K, Elven C, Zakher B, Motu'apuaka M, Paynter R, Kansagara D | title = The Effects of Cannabis Among Adults With Chronic Pain and an Overview of General Harms: A Systematic Review | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 167 | issue = 5 | pages = 319–331 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28806817 | doi = 10.7326/M17-0155 | url = http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2648595/effects-cannabis-among-adults-chronic-pain-overview-general-harms-systematic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When cannabis is inhaled to relieve pain, blood levels of cannabinoids rise faster than when oral products are used, peaking within three minutes and attaining an analgesic effect in seven minutes.&lt;ref name=aviram/&gt; A 2014 review found limited and weak evidence that smoked cannabis was effective for chronic non-cancer pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kahan M, Srivastava A, Spithoff S, Bromley L | title = Prescribing smoked cannabis for chronic noncancer pain: preliminary recommendations | journal = Canadian Family Physician Medecin De Famille Canadien | volume = 60 | issue = 12 | pages = 1083–90 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25500598 | pmc = 4264803 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 meta-analysis found that inhaled medical cannabis was effective in reducing neuropathic pain in the short term for one in five to six patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andreae MH, Carter GM, Shaparin N, Suslov K, Ellis RJ, Ware MA, Abrams DI, Prasad H, Wilsey B, Indyk D, Johnson M, Sacks HS | title = Inhaled Cannabis for Chronic Neuropathic Pain: A Meta-analysis of Individual Patient Data | journal = The Journal of Pain | volume = 16 | issue = 12 | pages = 1221–1232 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26362106 | pmc = 4666747 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpain.2015.07.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2015 review found limited evidence that medical cannabis was effective for neuropathic pain when combined with traditional analgesics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deshpande A, Mailis-Gagnon A, Zoheiry N, Lakha SF | title = Efficacy and adverse effects of medical marijuana for chronic noncancer pain: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials | journal = Canadian Family Physician Medecin De Famille Canadien | volume = 61 | issue = 8 | pages = e372-81 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26505059 | pmc = 4541447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannabis usually causes no tolerance or withdrawal symptoms except in heavy users.

=== Cognitive effects ===

A 2011 systematic review evaluated published studies of the acute and long-term cognitive effects of cannabis.  THC intoxication is well established to impair cognitive functioning on an acute basis, including effects on the ability to plan, organize, solve problems, make decisions, and control impulses. The extent of this impact may be greater in novice users, and paradoxically, those habituated to high-level ingestion may have reduced cognition during withdrawal.  Studies of long-term effects on cognition have provided conflicting results, with some studies finding no difference between long-term abstainers and never-users and others finding long-term deficits.  The discrepancies between studies may reflect greater long-term effects among heavier users relative to occasional users, and greater duration of effect among those with heavy use as adolescents compared to later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crean RD, Crane NA, Mason BJ | title = An evidence based review of acute and long-term effects of cannabis use on executive cognitive functions | journal = Journal of Addiction Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21321675 | pmc = 3037578 | doi = 10.1097/ADM.0b013e31820c23fa }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second systematic review focused on neuroimaging studies found little evidence supporting an effect of cannabis use on brain structure and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martín-Santos R, Fagundo AB, Crippa JA, Atakan Z, Bhattacharyya S, Allen P, Fusar-Poli P, Borgwardt S, Seal M, Busatto GF, McGuire P | title = Neuroimaging in cannabis use: a systematic review of the literature | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 383–98 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19627647 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291709990729 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 meta-analysis concluded that any long-term cognitive effects were relatively modest in magnitude and limited to certain aspects of learning and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grant I, Gonzalez R, Carey CL, Natarajan L, Wolfson T | title = Non-acute (residual) neurocognitive effects of cannabis use: a meta-analytic study | journal = Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 679–89 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12901774 | doi = 10.1017/S1355617703950016 | laysummary = http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20030701/heavy-marijuana-use-doesnt-damage-brain | laydate = 1 July 2003 | laysource = [[WebMD]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most psychoactive cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant is [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as THC).&lt;ref name=BenAmar2006 /&gt; Other cannabinoids include delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol, [[cannabidiol]] (CBD), [[cannabinol]] (CBN), [[cannabicyclol]] (CBL), [[cannabichromene]] (CBC) and [[cannabigerol]] (CBG); they have less psychotropic effects than THC, but may play a role in the overall effect of cannabis.&lt;ref name=BenAmar2006 /&gt; The most studied are THC, CBD and CBN.&lt;ref name=Gordon2013 /&gt;

CB1 and CB2 are the primary cannabinoid receptors responsible for several of the effects of cannabinoids, although other receptors may play a role as well. Both belong to a group of receptors called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). CB1 receptors are found in very high levels in the brain and are thought to be responsible for psychoactive effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mackie K | title = Cannabinoid receptors: where they are and what they do | journal = Journal of Neuroendocrinology | volume = 20 Suppl 1 | pages = 10–4 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18426493 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2826.2008.01671.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; CB2 receptors are found peripherally throughout the body and are thought to modulate pain and inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whiteside GT, Lee GP, Valenzano KJ | title = The role of the cannabinoid CB2 receptor in pain transmission and therapeutic potential of small molecule CB2 receptor agonists | journal = Current Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 14 | issue = 8 | pages = 917–36 | date = 2007 | pmid = 17430144 | doi = 10.2174/092986707780363023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Absorption ===
Cannabinoid absorption is dependent on its route of administration.

Inhaled and vaporized THC have similar absorption profiles to smoked THC, with a bioavailability ranging from 10 to 35%. Oral administration has the lowest bioavailability of approximately 6%, variable absorption depending on the vehicle used, and the longest time to peak plasma levels  (2 to 6 hours) compared to smoked or vaporized THC.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaston TE, Friedman D | title = Pharmacology of cannabinoids in the treatment of epilepsy | journal = Epilepsy &amp; Behavior | volume = 70 | issue = Pt B | pages = 313–318 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28087250 | doi = 10.1016/j.yebeh.2016.11.016 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525505016305790 | series = Cannabinoids and Epilepsy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to THC, CBD has poor oral bioavailability, approximately 6%. The low bioavailability is largely attributed to significant first-pass metabolism in the liver and erratic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. However, oral administration of CBD has a faster time to peak concentrations (2 hours) than THC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to the poor bioavailability of oral preparations, alternative routes of administration have been studied, including sublingual and rectal. These alternative formulations maximize bioavailability and reduce first-pass metabolism. Sublingual administration in rabbits yielded bioavailability of 16% and time to peak concentration of 4 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mannila J, Järvinen T, Järvinen K, Tervonen J, Jarho P | title = Sublingual administration of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol/beta-cyclodextrin complex increases the bioavailability of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol in rabbits | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 78 | issue = 17 | pages = 1911–4 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16266727 | doi = 10.1016/j.lfs.2005.08.025 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320505010374 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rectal administration in monkeys doubled bioavailability to 13.5% and achieved peak blood concentrations within 1 to 8 hours after administration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huestis MA | title = Human cannabinoid pharmacokinetics | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = 1770–804 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17712819 | pmc = 2689518 | doi = 10.1002/cbdv.200790152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution ===
Like cannabinoid absorption, distribution is also dependent on route of administration. Smoking and inhalation of vaporized cannabis have better absorption than do other routes of administration, and therefore also have more predictable distribution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Badowski ME | title = A review of oral cannabinoids and medical marijuana for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: a focus on pharmacokinetic variability and pharmacodynamics | journal = Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 441–449 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28780725 | pmc = 5573753 | doi = 10.1007/s00280-017-3387-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; THC is highly protein bound once absorbed, with only 3% found unbound in the plasma. It distributes rapidly to highly vascularized organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys, as well as to various glands. Low levels can be detected in the brain, testes, and unborn fetuses, all of which are protected from systemic circulation via barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nahas GG | title = The pharmacokinetics of THC in fat and brain: resulting functional responses to marihuana smoking | journal = Human Psychopharmacology | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 247–255 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 12404577 | doi = 10.1002/hup.258 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hup.258/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; THC further distributes into fatty tissues a few days after administration due to its high lipophilicity, and is found deposited in the spleen and fat after redistribution.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bridgeman MB, Abazia DT | title = Medicinal Cannabis: History, Pharmacology, And Implications for the Acute Care Setting | journal = P &amp; T | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 180–188 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28250701 | pmc = 5312634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=AYH5BwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA91&amp;ots=R8i0vjfo1L&amp;sig=x9G7Uhaghl6-67n1V80ZL4EENTI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Marihuana and Medicine|last=Nahas|first=Gabriel G.|last2=Sutin|first2=Kenneth M.|last3=Harvey|first3=David J.|last4=Agurell|first4=Stig | name-list-format = vanc |date=1999-04-05|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-59259-710-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metabolism ===
[[File:THC-COOH biosynthesis v2.svg|thumb|Metabolism of THC to 11-COOH-THC]]
Delta-9-THC is the primary molecule responsible for the effects of cannabis. Delta-9-THC is metabolized in the liver and turns into 11-OH-THC.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sapiensoup.com/human-metabolism-thc|title=Human Metabolism of THC|date=2016-12-21|work=Sapiensoup Blog|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;11-OH-THC is the first metabolic product in this pathway. Both Delta-9-THC and 11-OH-THC are psychoactive. The metabolism of THC into 11-OH-THC plays a part in the heightened psychoactive effects of edible cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://profofpot.com/11-hydroxy-tetrahydrocannabinol-potency-edibles/|title=11-Hydroxy-THC - Increased Potency That Explains the Effect of Edibles? - Prof of Pot|website=profofpot.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, 11-OH-THC is metabolized in the liver into 11-COOH-THC, which is the second metabolic product of THC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consultox.com/toxicology-marijuana.shtml|title=Toxicology Litigation Support: Marijuana|website=consultox.com|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;11-COOH-THC is not psychoactive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ingestion of edible cannabis products lead to a slower onset of effect than the inhalation of it because the THC travels to the liver first through the blood before it travels to the rest of the body. Inhaled cannabis can result in THC going directly to the brain, where it then travels from the brain back to the liver in recirculation for metabolism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Eventually, both routes of metabolism result in the metabolism of psychoactive THC to inactive 11-COOH-THC.

=== Excretion ===
Due to the large propensity of THC and CBD being hepatically metabolized, a majority of their metabolites are excreted via feces than in the urine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After delta-9-THC is hydroxylated into 11-OH-THC via CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, it undergoes phase II metabolism into more than 30 metabolites. A majority of these metabolites are products of glucuronidation. Approximately 65% is excreted in feces and 25% in the urine, while the remaining 10% is excreted by other means.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The terminal half-life is approximately 25–36 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grotenhermen F | title = Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cannabinoids | journal = Clinical Pharmacokinetics | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 327–60 | date = 2003-04-01 | pmid = 12648025 | doi = 10.2165/00003088-200342040-00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBD is hydroxylated by P450 liver enzymes into 7-OH-CBD. Its metabolites are products of primarily CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 activity, with potential activity of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Juřica|first=Ondřej  Zendulka,  Gabriela  Dovrtělová,  Kristýna  Nosková,  Miroslav  Turjap,  Alexandra  Šulcová,  Lumír  Hanuš and   Jan|date=2016-02-29|title=Cannabinoids and Cytochrome P450 Interactions|url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/137749/article|journal=Current Drug Metabolism|language=en|volume=17|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to delta-9-THC, a majority of CBD is excreted in feces and some in the urine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The terminal half-life is approximately 18–32 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ohlsson A, Lindgren JE, Andersson S, Agurell S, Gillespie H, Hollister LE | title = Single-dose kinetics of deuterium-labelled cannabidiol in man after smoking and intravenous administration | journal = Biomedical &amp; Environmental Mass Spectrometry | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 77–83 | date = February 1986 | pmid = 2937482 | doi = 10.1002/bms.1200130206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blausen 0158 Cannabis Medicinal.png|thumb|left|Illustrating various forms of medicinal cannabis]]

Smoking has been the means of administration of cannabis for many users, but it is not suitable for the use of cannabis as a medicine.&lt;ref name=CurtisClarke2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Curtis A, Clarke CE, Rickards HE | title = Cannabinoids for Tourette's Syndrome | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume =  | issue = 4 | pages = CD006565 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19821373 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006565.pub2 | type = Review | subscription = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most common method of medical cannabis consumption in the US {{asof|lc=yes|2013}}.&lt;ref name=Borgelt2013 /&gt; It is difficult to predict the pharmacological response to cannabis because concentration of cannabinoids varies widely, as there are different ways of preparing it for consumption (smoked, applied as oils, eaten, infused into other foods,  or drunk) and a lack of production controls.&lt;ref name=Borgelt2013 /&gt; The potential for adverse effects from smoke inhalation makes smoking a less viable option than oral preparations.&lt;ref name=CurtisClarke2009 /&gt; [[Vaporizer (cannabis)|Cannabis vaporizers]] have gained popularity because of the perception among users that fewer harmful chemicals are ingested when components are inhaled via aerosol rather than smoke.&lt;ref name=Borgelt2013 /&gt; Cannabinoid medicines are available in pill form ([[dronabinol]] and [[nabilone]]) and liquid extracts formulated into an oromucosal spray ([[nabiximols]]).&lt;ref name=Borgelt2013 /&gt; Oral preparations are "problematic due to the uptake of cannabinoids into fatty tissue, from which they are released slowly, and the significant first-pass liver metabolism, which breaks down Δ9THC and contributes further to the variability of plasma concentrations".&lt;ref name=CurtisClarke2009 /&gt;

=== Ancient ===

Cannabis, called ''má'' [[wikt: 麻|麻]] (meaning "hemp; cannabis; numbness") or ''dàmá'' [[Wikt:大麻|大麻]] (with "big; great") in Chinese, was used in [[Taiwan]] for fiber starting about 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = Ernest L. |last = Abel |year = 1980 |chapter = Cannabis in the Ancient World |chapterurl = http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/history/first12000/1.htm |title = Marihuana: the first twelve thousand years |publisher = Plenum Publishers |location = New York City |isbn = 978-0-306-40496-2 }}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The botanist [[Hui-lin Li]] wrote that in China, "The use of Cannabis in medicine was probably a very early development. Since ancient humans used hemp seed as food, it was quite natural for them to also discover the medicinal properties of the plant."&lt;ref&gt;Li, Hui-Lin (1974). "An Archaeological and Historical Account of Cannabis in China", ''Economic Botany'' 28.4:437–448, p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Shen-Nung]], who was also a pharmacologist, wrote a book on treatment methods in 2737 BCE that included the medical benefits of cannabis.

Surviving texts from [[History of India|ancient India]] confirm that cannabis' psychoactive properties were recognized, and doctors used it for treating a variety of illnesses and ailments, including insomnia, headaches, gastrointestinal disorders, and pain, including during childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Touw M | title = The religious and medicinal uses of Cannabis in China, India and Tibet | journal = Journal of Psychoactive Drugs | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–34 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7024492 | doi = 10.1080/02791072.1981.10471447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Irish physician, [[William Brooke O'Shaughnessy]], is credited with introducing cannabis to Western medicine.&lt;ref name=Mack&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Alison Mack |author2 = Janet Joy |title = Marijuana As Medicine?: The Science Beyond the Controversy |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZriSkC7aQOEC&amp;pg=PA15 |date = 7 December 2000 |publisher = National Academies Press |isbn = 978-0-309-06531-3 |pages = 15–}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Shaughnessy discovered cannabis in the 1830s while living abroad in [[India]], where he conducted numerous experiments investigating its medical utility.&lt;ref name="Booth"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Booth |first1 = Martin |title = Cannabis: A History |date = June 2005 |publisher = St. Martin's Press |location = New York |isbn = 978-0-312-42494-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noting in particular its [[analgesic]] and [[anticonvulsant]] effects, O'Shaughnessy returned to [[England]] with a supply of cannabis in 1842, after which its use spread through Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="Grinspoon"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Grinspoon |first1 = Lester |last2 = Bakalar |first2 = James |title = Marihuana, the Forbidden Medicine |date = 1997 |publisher = Yale University Press |isbn = 978-0-300-07086-6 |edition = Revised and expanded }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cannabis was entered into the [[United States Pharmacopeia]] in 1850.&lt;ref name="Booth" /&gt;

The use of cannabis in medicine began to decline by the end of the 19th century, due to difficulty in controlling dosages and the rise in popularity of synthetic and [[opium]]-derived drugs.&lt;ref name="Grinspoon" /&gt;  Also, the advent of the hypodermic [[syringe]] allowed these drugs to be injected for immediate effect, in contrast to cannabis which is not water-soluble and therefore cannot be injected.&lt;ref name="Grinspoon" /&gt;

In the United States, the medical use of cannabis further declined with the passage of the [[Marihuana Tax Act of 1937]], which imposed new regulations and fees on physicians prescribing cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Pacula |first1 = Rosalie Piccardo |title = State Medical Marijuana Laws: Understanding the Laws and Their Limitations |journal = Journal of Public Health Policy |date = February 2002 |doi = 10.2307/3343240 |url = http://impacteen.uic.edu/generalarea_PDFs/medicalmarijuanapaper100301.pdf |volume=23 |page=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cannabis was removed from the U.S. Pharmacopeia in 1941, and officially banned for any use with the passage of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970.&lt;ref name="Grinspoon" /&gt;

Cannabis is in Schedule IV of the United Nations' [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], making it subject to special restrictions. Article 2 provides for the following, in reference to Schedule IV drugs:

{{quote|quote=A Party shall, if in its opinion the prevailing conditions in its country render it the most appropriate means of protecting the public health and welfare, prohibit the production, manufacture, export and import of, trade in, possession or use of any such drug except for amounts which may be necessary for medical and scientific research only, including clinical trials therewith to be conducted under or subject to the direct supervision and control of the Party.&lt;ref name="Single Convention"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/single-convention.html |title = Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 As amended by the 1972 Protocol |date = 13 March 1961 |work = [[International Narcotics Control Board]] |publisher = United Nations |pages = 2–3 |access-date = 17 August 2009 |format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The convention thus allows countries to outlaw cannabis for all non-research purposes but lets nations choose to allow use for medical and scientific purposes if they believe total prohibition is not the most appropriate means of protecting health and welfare. The convention requires that states that permit the production or use of medical cannabis must operate a licensing system for all cultivators, manufacturers, and distributors and ensure that the total cannabis market of the state shall not exceed that required "for medical and scientific purposes."&lt;ref name="Single Convention" /&gt;

==== United States ====
{{See also|Medical cannabis in the United States}}

In the United States, the medical use of cannabis is legal in 33 states, plus the territories of [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], as of November 2018.&lt;ref name="NCSL"&gt;{{cite web |title = State Medical Marijuana Laws |url = http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx |website = National Conference of State Legislatures |date = 27 June 2018 |access-date = 3 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional 14 states have laws in effect to allow the use of CBD products.&lt;ref name="NCSL" /&gt;  Cannabis remains illegal at the federal level by way of the [[Controlled Substances Act]], under which cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use.  In December 2014, however, the [[Rohrabacher–Farr amendment]] was signed into law, prohibiting the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] from prosecuting individuals acting in accordance with state medical cannabis laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Ingraham |first1 = Christopher |title = Jeff Sessions personally asked Congress to let him prosecute medical-marijuana providers |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/13/jeff-sessions-personally-asked-congress-to-let-him-prosecute-medical-marijuana-providers/ |access-date = 9 July 2017 |work = The Washington Post |date = 13 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of obtaining medical cannabis varies by region and by legislation. In the US, most consumers grow their own or buy it from [[Cannabis dispensaries in the United States|cannabis dispensaries]] in states where it is legal.&lt;ref name=Borgelt2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BaltSun&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bs-md-medical-marijuana-fees-20141011,0,3253557.story?page=1 |title = Medical marijuana fees stir debate in Maryland |publisher = The Baltimore Sun |author = Timothy B.

==== Insurance ====

In the United States, health insurance companies may not pay for a medical marijuana prescription as the [[Food and Drug Administration]] must approve any substance for medicinal purposes. Before this can happen, the FDA must first permit the study of the medical benefits and drawbacks of the substance, which it has not done since it was placed on Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act in 1970. Therefore, all expenses incurred fulfilling a medical marijuana prescription will possibly be incurred as out-of-pocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.insurancecompliancecorner.com/the-medical-marijuana-debate/ |title = The Medical Marijuana Debate |last1 = Clark |first1 = Tonya Body |date = 10 February 2015 |website = Compliance Corner |publisher = Wolters Kluwer Financial Services |access-date = 26 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[New Mexico Court of Appeals]] has ruled that [[workers' compensation]] insurance must pay for prescribed marijuana as part of the state's Medical Cannabis Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nmpoliticalreport.com/4483/court-employer-cant-block-workers-comp-for-medical-marijuana/ |title = Court: Employer can’t block workers’ comp for medical marijuana |last1 = Peters |first1 = Joey |date = 29 June 2015 |website = NM Political Report |publisher =  |access-date = 30 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recreational use ===

The authors of a report on a 2011 survey of medical cannabis users say that critics have suggested that some users "game the system" to obtain medical cannabis ostensibly for treatment of a condition, but then use it for nonmedical purposes&amp;nbsp;– though the truth of this claim is hard to measure.&lt;ref name=Reinarman2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reinarman C, Nunberg H, Lanthier F, Heddleston T | title = Who are medical marijuana patients?

=== Brand names ===

In the US, the FDA has approved two oral cannabinoids for use as medicine: [[tetrahydrocannabinol#Marinol|dronabinol]] and [[nabilone]].&lt;ref name=Borgelt2013 /&gt; Dronabinol, synthetic THC, is listed as Schedule II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Rule: Placement of FDA-Approved Products of Oral Solutions Containing Dronabinol [(-)-delta-9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC)] in Schedule II|url=https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/rules/2017/fr1122_6.htm|website=U.S. Department of Justice|access-date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, is also Schedule II, indicating high potential for side effects and addiction.&lt;ref name=Svrakic2012 /&gt; Both received approval for sale in the US in 1985, under the brand names Marinol and Cesamet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Clark |first1 = Amy |title = 'New' Pot Pill For Chemo Patients |url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-pot-pill-for-chemo-patients/ |access-date = 26 July 2017 |work = CBS News |agency = Associated Press |date = 16 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nabiximols]], an oromucosal spray derived from two strains of ''Cannabis sativa'' and containing THC and CBD,&lt;ref name=Svrakic2012 /&gt; is not approved in the United States, but is approved in several European countries, Canada, and New Zealand as of 2013.&lt;ref name=Borgelt2013 /&gt; As of 2018, medical marijuana in Canada is being legally distributed to registered patients in bud, drops and capsule forms by such companies as [[Canopy Growth Corporation|Canopy Growth Corp.]] and [[Aurora Cannabis]].

As an [[antiemetic]], these medications are usually used when conventional treatment for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy fail to work.&lt;ref name=Borgelt2013 /&gt;

[[Nabiximols]] is used for treatment of spasticity associated with MS when other therapies have not worked, and when an initial trial demonstrates "meaningful improvement".&lt;ref name=Borgelt2013 /&gt; Trials for FDA approval in the US are underway.&lt;ref name=Borgelt2013 /&gt; It is also approved in several European countries for overactive bladder and [[emesis|vomiting]].&lt;ref name=Svrakic2012 /&gt; When sold under the trade name Sativex as a mouth spray, the prescribed daily dose in Sweden delivers a maximum of 32.4&amp;nbsp;mg of [[THC]] and 30&amp;nbsp;mg of [[Cannabidiol|CBD]]; mild to moderate dizziness is common during the first few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fass.se/LIF/product?1&amp;docType=6&amp;specId&amp;userType&amp;nplId=20101019000051 |title = Produkt – FASS Allmänhet |work = fass.se }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
{{main|Medical cannabis research}}
Medical cannabis research includes any [[medical research]] on using [[cannabis]] as a treatment for any [[medical condition]]. For reasons including increased popular support of cannabis use, a trend of [[cannabis legalization]], and the perception of medical usefulness, more scientists are doing medical cannabis research. Medical cannabis is unusually broad as a treatment for many conditions, each of which has its own state of research. Similarly, various countries conduct and respond to medical cannabis research in different ways.

The '''NHS Constitution for England''' is a document that sets out the objectives of the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]], the rights and responsibilities of the various parties involved in health care, (patients, staff, trust boards) and the guiding principles which govern the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england |title=The NHS Constitution for England |publisher=NHS choices |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; First published on 21 January 2009 it was one of a number of recommendations in [[Lord Darzi]]’s report ‘High Quality Care for All’ as part of a ten-year plan to provide the highest quality of care and service for patients in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110506035152/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/healthcare/nhsconstitution/index.htm Sourced from the National Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; Previously these rights and responsibilities had evolved in common law or through [[English law|English]] or [[EU law]], or were policy pledges by the NHS and [[UK government]] have been written into the document.{{cn|date=October 2016}} It can be seen as a development of the ideas that began with the introduction of the [[Patient's Charter]] in 1991.{{cn|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/infogov/caldicott/caldresources/consultationresps/consultnhsconstit.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021112030/http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/infogov/caldicott/caldresources/consultationresps/consultnhsconstit.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 October 2015 |title=A consultation on The NHS Constitution |publisher=Department of Health |type=pdf |page=13 |date=30 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike a real [[constitution]], the document is not itself legally enforceable, though it purports to set out the rights that patients and staff. It is fairly brief, written in plain terms and is simple to understand. Accompanying is a handbook which gives more information to patients and staff about the document, and also provides detail on the legislation that underpins the rights. A statement of NHS accountability also gives a clear account of the NHS system of accountability, transparency and responsibility.

==Guiding principles==
In summary, seven key principles guide the NHS in all that it does:

1.The NHS provides a comprehensive service, available to all irrespective of age, gender, disability, race, sexual orientation, religion, belief, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity or marital or civil partnership status. The service is designed to improve, prevent, diagnose and treat both physical and mental health problems with equal regard. . It has a duty to each and every individual that it serves and must respect their human rights. At the same time, it has a wider social duty to promote equality through the services it provides, and to pay particular attention to groups or sections of society where improvements in health and life expectancy are not keeping pace with the rest of the population.

2.Access to NHS services is based on clinical need, not an individual’s ability to pay (except in exceptional circumstances sanctioned by Parliament).

3.The NHS aspires to the highest standards of excellence and professionalism to provide high quality care that is safe, effective and focused on the patient experience; in the people it employs, and in the support, education, training and development that they receive; in the leadership and management of its organizations; and through its commitment to innovation and to the promotion, conduct and use of research to improve the current and future health and care of the population. Respect, dignity, compassion and care should be at the core of how patients and staff are treated, not only because that is the right thing to do, but because patient safety, experience and outcomes are all improved when staff are valued, empowered and supported.

4.The patient will be at the heart of everything the NHS does. It should support individuals to promote and manage their own health. NHS services must reflect, and should be coordinated around and tailored to, the needs and preferences of patients, their families and their carers. As part of this, the NHS will ensure that in line with the Armed Forces Covenant, those in the armed forces, reservists, their families and veterans are not disadvantaged in accessing health services in the area they reside. Patients, with their families and carers, where appropriate, will be involved in and consulted on all decisions about their care and treatment. The NHS will actively encourage feedback from the public, patients and staff, welcome it and use it to improve its services.

5.The NHS works across organisational boundaries and in partnership with other organisations in the interest of patients, local communities and the wider population. The NHS is an integrated system of organisations and services bound together by the principles and values reflected in the document. The NHS is committed to working jointly with other local authority services, other public sector organisations, and a wide range of private and voluntary sector organisations to provide and deliver improvements in health and wellbeing.

6.The NHS is committed to providing best value for taxpayers' money and the most effective, fair sustainable use of finite resources. Public funds for healthcare will be devoted solely to the benefit of the people that the NHS serves.

7.The NHS is accountable to the public, communities and patients that it serves. The NHS is a national service funded through national taxation, and it is the Government which sets the framework for the NHS and which is accountable to Parliament for its operation. However, most decisions in the NHS, especially those about the treatment of individuals and the detailed organization of services, are rightly taken by the local NHS and by patients with their clinicians. The system of responsibility and accountability for taking decisions in the NHS should be transparent and clear to the public, patients and staff. The Government will ensure that there is always a clear and up-to-date statement of NHS accountability for this purpose.

The NHS Constitution outlines a series of patient rights, along with commitments from the NHS, to the patient. These are in the areas of;

- Access to health services
- Quality of care and environment
- Nationally approved treatments, drugs and programmes
- Respect, consent and confidentiality
- Informed choice
- Involvement in your healthcare and in the NHS
- Complaint and redress.

==Access to health services==
The document defines rights regarding access to health services, including rights to:
*access NHS services free of charge, apart from certain limited exceptions sanctioned by Parliament
*never be refused access on unreasonable grounds
*expect the NHS to assess the requirements of your community and put in place the services to meet those needs
*not to be unlawfully discriminated against in the provision of NHS services
*access certain services commissioned by NHS bodies within maximum waiting times, or for the NHS to take all reasonable steps to offer a range of suitable alternative providers if this is not possible (waiting times are described in the Handbook).  See [[NHS targets]].

The NHS also commits: 
*to provide convenient, easy access to services within the waiting times set out in the Handbook to the NHS Constitution 
*to make decisions in a clear and transparent way
*to make the transition as smooth as possible when referred between services, and to put 'you, your family and carers at the centre of decisions that affect you of them (pledge).'

==Quality of care and environment==
The document defines rights regarding quality of care and environment, including:
*The right to be treated with a professional standard of care, by appropriately qualified and experienced staff, in a properly approved or registered organisation that meets required levels of safety and quality.
*The right to be cared for in a clean, safe, secure and suitable environment
*The right to receive suitable and nutritious food and hydration to sustain good health and wellbeing
*The right to expect NHS organisations to monitor, and make efforts to improve, the quality of healthcare they commission or provide

The NHS also commits:

*to identify and share best practice in quality of care and treatments.

==Nationally approved treatments, drugs and programmes==
The document defines rights regarding approved treatments, drugs and programmes. Patients have the right to:
*drugs and treatments that have been recommended by [[NICE]] for use in the NHS, if their doctor says they are clinically appropriate for them.
*expect local decisions on funding of other drugs and treatments to be made rationally following a proper consideration of the evidence. If the local NHS decides not to fund a drug or treatment that you and your doctor feel would be right for you, the local NHS must explain that decision.
*receive the approved vaccinations that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommends that you should receive under an NHS-provided national immunization programme.

The NHS also commits:

*to provide screening programmes as recommended by the UK National Screening Committee

==Respect, consent and confidentiality==
With regard to rights regarding respect, consent and confidentiality, the NHS Constitution gives patients the right to:
*be treated with dignity and respect in accordance with your human rights.
*be protected from abuse and neglect, and care and treatment that is degrading.
*accept or refuse treatment that is offered to you, and not to be given any examination or treatment without valid consent.
*be given information about the test and treatment options available to you, what they involve, and their risks and benefits.
*access your own health records, and to have any factual inaccuracies corrected.
*privacy and confidentiality and to expect the NHS to keep their confidential information safe and secure.
*be informed how your information is used
*request that your confidential information is not used beyond your own care and treatment, and to have your objections considered, and where your wishes cannot be followed, to be told the reasons including the legal basis.

The NHS also commits:

*to ensure those involved in your care and treatment have access to your health information
*that if you are admitted to hospital, you will not have to share sleeping accommodation with patients of the opposite sex
*to anonymise information collected during the course of your treatment
*where identifiable information has to be used, to give you the chance to object wherever possible
*to inform you of research studies in which you may be eligible to participate
*to share with you any correspondence sent between clinicians about your care.

==Informed choice==
Patients are given rights under the document in relation to [[Patient choice|informed choice]] including the right to:
*choose their own GP practice, and to be accepted by that practice unless there are reasonable grounds to refuse
*express a preference for using a particular doctor within your GP practice, and for the practice to try to comply.
*transparent, accessible and comparable data on the quality of local healthcare providers, and on outcomes, as compared to others nationally.
*make choices about the services commissioned by NHS bodies, and to information to support these choices.

The NHS also commits to:

*inform you about the healthcare services available to you, locally and nationally.
*to offer you easily accessible information in a form you can understand.

==Involvement in your health care and in the NHS==
The NHS recognized fully that the population has rights regarding involvement in their own health care and in the NHS. There are rights to:
*be involved in planning and making decisions about your health and care with your care provider or providers, including your end of life care, and to be given information and support to enable you to do this. Where appropriate this right includes your family and carers. This includes being given the chance to manage your own care and treatment if appropriate.
8to an open and transparent relationship with the organization providing your care. You must be told about any safety incident relating to your care, which, in the opinion of a healthcare professional, has caused, or could still cause, significant harm or death. You must be given the facts, an apology, and any reasonable support you need.
*be involved, directly or through representatives, in the planning of health care services commissioned by NHS bodies, the development and consideration of proposals for changes in the way those services are provided, and in decisions to be made affecting the operation of those services.

The NHS also commits:

*to provide you with the information and support you need to influence and scrutinize the planning and delivery of NHS services.
*to work in partnership with you, your family, carers and representatives.
*to involve you in discussions about planning your care and to offer you a written record of what is agreed if you want one.
*to encourage and welcome feedback on your health and care experiences and use this to improve services.

==Complaint and redress==
When complaining or seeking redress, patients are given rights to:
*have any complaint you make about NHS services, acknowledged within three working days, and to have it properly investigated.
*discuss the manner in which the complaint is to be handled, and to know the period within which the investigation is likely to be completed and the response sent.
*be kept informed of progress and to know the outcome of any investigation into your complaint, including an explanation of the conclusions and confirmation that any action needed in consequence of the complaint has been taken or is proposed to be taken.
*take your complaint to the independent Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, if you are not satisfied with the way your complaint was dealt with by the NHS.
*make a claim for [[judicial review]] if you think you have been directly affected by an unlawful act or decision of an NHS body or local authority.
*compensation where they have been harmed by negligent treatment.

The NHS also commits to:

*ensure that you are treated with courtesy and you receive appropriate support throughout the handling of a complaint; and that the fact that you have complained, will not adversely affect any future treatment.
*ensure that when mistakes happen, or if you are harmed whilst receiving health care, you receive an appropriate explanation and apology
*ensure that the organization learns lessons from complaints and claims, and uses these to improve NHS services.

3b. Patients and the public responsibilities

The NHS belongs to us all. There are things that we can all do for ourselves and for one another, to help it work effectively, and to ensure resources are used responsibly

Please:

*recognize that you can make a significant contribution to your own, and your family's, good health and wellbeing, and take personal responsibility for it.
*register with a GP practice
*treat NHS staff and other patients with respect and recognize that violence, or the causing of nuisance or disturbance on NHS premises, could result in prosecution.
*provide accurate information about your health, condition and status
*keep appointments, or cancel within reasonable time. Receiving treatment within the maximum waiting times may be compromised unless you do.
*follow the course of treatment which you have agreed, and talk to your clinician if you find this difficult.
*participate in important public health programmes such as vaccination
*ensure that those closest to you are aware of your wishes about organ donation
*give feedback, both positive and negative.

== NHS Staff ==

=== 4a. Staff rights and NHS pledges to staff ===


It is the commitment, professionalism and dedication of staff working for the benefit of the people that the NHS serves, which really make the difference. High-quality care requires high-quality workplaces, with commissioners and providers aiming to be employers of choice.

*to have a process for staff to raise an internal grievance
*to encourage and support all staff in raising concerns at the earliest reasonable opportunity about safety, malpractice or wrongdoing at work, responding to and, where necessary, investigating the concerns raised and acting consistently with the Employment Rights Act 1996

=== 4b. Staff responsibilities ===


All staff have responsibilities to the public, their patients and colleagues.

*You have a duty to accept professional accountability and maintain the standards of professional practice as set by the appropriate regulatory body applicable to your profession or role.
*You have a duty to take reasonable care of health and safety at work for  you, your team and others, and to co-operate with employers to ensure compliance with health and safety requirements.

your wider contribution to the aims of your team and the NHS as a whole
*to find alternative sources of care or assistance for patients, when you are unable to provide this (including for those patients who are not receiving basic care to meet their needs)
*to take up training and development opportunities provided over and above those legally required of your post
*to play your part in sustainably improving services by working in partnership with patients, the public and communities
*to raise any genuine concern you may have about a risk, malpractice or wrongdoing at work (such as a risk to patient safety, fraud or breaches of patient confidentiality), which may affect
patients, the public, other staff or the organisation itself, at the earliest reasonable opportunity
*to involve patients, their families, carers or representatives fully in decisions about prevention, diagnosis, and their individual care and treatment
*to be open with patients, their families, carers or representatives, including if anything goes wrong, welcoming and listening to feedback and addressing concerns promptly and in a spirit of co-operation
*to contribute to a climate where the truth can be heard, the reporting of, and learning from, errors is encouraged and colleagues are supported where errors are made
*to view the services you provide from the standpoint of a patient, and involve patients, their families and carers in the services you provide, working with them, their communities and other organisations, and making it clear who is responsible for their care
*to take every appropriate opportunity to encourage and support patients and colleagues to improve their health and wellbeing
*to contribute towards providing fair and equitable services for all and play your part, wherever possible, in helping to reduce inequalities in experience, access or outcomes between differing groups or sections of society requiring health care

The '''National Institute of Medical Herbalists''' (NIMH) is a professional body regulating medical [[herbalists]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was first established as the National Association of Medical Herbalists in 1864 by a group of herbalists from the north of England, but currently has members worldwide. Members have undergone a lengthy training program before registering as qualified medical herbalists. Practitioners train for at least three years at degree level including over 500 hours of clinical practice, and adhere to a strict code of conduct before they can gain MNIMH or FNIMH after their name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimh.org.uk/ National Institute of Medical Herbalists&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; NIMH-registered medical [[herbalists]] are trained in the same diagnostic skills as mainstream doctors and take a holistic approach to health. Its official journal is the  ''[[Journal of Herbal Medicine]]''.

NIMH has approximately 500 active and 300 non-active members and organizes annual conferences.

__NOTOC__
The '''New Zealand Food Safety Authority''' ('''NZFSA'''), or '''Te Pou Oranga Kai O Aotearoa''', was the [[New Zealand]] government body responsible for food safety. NZFSA was also the controlling authority for imports and exports of [[food]] and food-related products. In April 2012 it was merged into the [[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Ministry for Primary Industries]].

The NZFSA administered legislation covering:

* food for sale in New Zealand
* primary processing of [[animal]] products and official assurances related to their export
* exports of [[plant]] products and the controls surrounding registration, and
* use of [[agricultural]] compounds and veterinary medicines.

In July 2007 the NZFSA was separated from the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (New Zealand)|Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry]] to form a new Public Service Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/about-us/profile/index.htm|title=Profile, July 2007|accessdate=2007-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 2010, the New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA) was amalgamated back into the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/about/ About FSA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food Bill 160-2==
[[Food Bill 160-2 of New Zealand|Food Bill 160-2]] was introduced on 26 May 2010 to make some fundamental changes&lt;ref name=foodsafety_fundamental_changes&gt;[http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/policy-law/reform-nz-food-regulations/food-bill/ foodsafety.govt.nz Proposed Food Bill]&lt;/ref&gt; to New Zealand's domestic food regulatory regime. Significantly, for an export-led economic recovery for New Zealand, the domestic food regulatory regime is the platform for exports.&lt;ref name=RIS&gt;[http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/Regulatory_Impact-Specifically_Covers.pdf Regulatory Impact Statement 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand domestic standard is used as the basis for negotiating equivalence arrangements with trading partners. This minimizes the excessive importing country requirements that may be imposed but which do not go to food safety. If passed into law and fully implemented, it would replace the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1981/0045/13.0/DLM48687.html Food Act 1981] and the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/1974/0169/latest/whole.html Food Hygiene Regulations 1974]. Food Bill will also make consequential amendments to the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1999/0093/latest/whole.html Animal Products Act 1999] and the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0114/latest/whole.html Wine Act 2003] to improve the interface of regulatory processes across food sectors.

MAF (through NZFSA) managed New Zealand's participation in [[Codex Alimentarius]] and set strategic priorities which ensure that Codex standards have the widest possible application.&lt;ref name=NZandCodex&gt;[http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/policy-law/codex/nz/index.htm New Zealand and Codex]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nordic bread culture''' has existed in [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]] from prehistoric time through to the present.

== Prehistoric time (until around 1000 AD) ==
Four [[Cereal|grain]] types dominated in the [[Nordic countries]]: [[barley]] and [[rye]] are the oldest; [[wheat]] and [[oats]] are more recent. During the [[Iron Age]] (500 AD – 1050 AD), rye became the most commonly used grain, followed by barley and oats. Rye was also the most commonly used grain for bread up until the beginning of the 20th century. Today, older grain types such as [[emmer]] and [[spelt]] are once again being cultivated and new bread types are being developed from these grains.

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] finds in [[Denmark]] indicate use of the two triticum (wheat) species, emmer and [[einkorn]], during the [[Mesolithic Period]] (8900 BC – 3900 BC). There is no direct evidence of bread-making, but cereals have been crushed, cooked and served as [[porridge]] since at least 4,200 BC. During the [[Neolithic Period]] (3900 BC – 1800 BC), when [[agriculture]] was introduced, barley seems to have taken over to some extent, and [[ceramic]] plates apparently used for baking are found. Moulded cereals, with water added to make a [[dough]] and baked or [[Frying|fried]] in the shape of bread, are known as [[Grave goods|burial gift]]s in Iron Age graves (200 AD onwards) in the [[Mälardalen]] area of central [[Sweden]]. However, it is not certain that this bread was eaten; it could just have been a burial gift. During the [[Bronze Age]] (1800 BC – 500 AD), oats and the triticum species spelt seem to have been the most commonly used grains, and we see the first real [[oven]]s, probably used for baking small loaves and perhaps the first bread (probably around 400 AD).

[[Scandinavia]]n soldiers in [[Roman times]] apparently learned baking techniques when working as [[mercenaries]] in the [[Roman army]] (200–400 AD). They subsequently took the technique home with them to show that they had been employed in high status work on the continent{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}. Early [[Christian tradition]]s promoted an interest in bread. Culturally, [[Germany|German]] traditions have influenced most of the bread types in the Nordic countries. In the eastern part of [[Finland]], there is a cultural link to [[Russia]] and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] bread traditions.

In the Nordic countries, bread was the main part of a meal until the late 18th century. Four different bread regions can be found in the Nordic area in the late 19th century. In the south, soft [[rye bread]] dominated. Further north came [[crisp bread]], usually baked with rye, then thin and crispy [[barley bread]]. In the far north, soft barley loaves dominated. During the 19th century, [[potato]]es began to become the centrepiece of meals and bread was put aside as an extra source of [[carbohydrate]]s in a meal. Bread still retained its key function for [[breakfast]], as the [[open sandwich]] is a starter for most Nordic people today and potatoes are used as a centrepiece in [[lunch]]es and [[dinner]]s.

A history of Nordic bread from around 1000 AD and some contemporary types and bread innovations is presented below. Countries are presented in alphabetic order ([[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]). The names of the bread types are mostly given in both the contemporary national language and in English.

== Denmark ==

===History===
Not much is known about the bread types used in Denmark up until the [[Middle Ages]], but we believe that they were mostly [[leavening|unleavened]] and that the [[flour]] was a mixture of various types of grain, as a pure [[monoculture]] was probably not possible at the time. Rye bread was still baked at [[farm]]s well into the 19th century, as most people lived in the countryside. The loaves were [[wikt:oblong|oblong]] in shape, made from ground whole rye, leavened with [[sour dough]] and sometimes sweetened with [[malt syrup]]. The loaves weighed up to 15–16&amp;nbsp;kg. They were baked once a month, as heating the oven was both time-consuming and used a lot of [[firewood]]. The [[baker]]s in the towns baked their rye bread for the day.

We only know little about the other types of bread in the olden times. More refined bread types for special occasions and feasts were prepared from [[Sieve|sifted]] rye flour, and loaves made from wheat must have been eaten. Around 1400, the emblem of the bakers’ [[guild]] became the triangular ''skonrogge'' (i.e. a small leavened rye bread that is cleaved and baked again until dry, also Danish beskøjt, French biscuit, Latin bis-coctus: baked twice). Around 1600, the skonrogge was replaced as the baker’s emblem by the [[pretzel]]-shaped ''[[kringle]]'', which is still the emblem of the bakers’ guild today. We find the first systematic description of Danish bread in 1821 in Charles Adolph Dénys Mourier’s book on bread and bread-making. He describes various leavened bread types: ''rugbrød'' (whole rye bread), ''franskbrød'' (white wheat bread), ''sigtebrød'' (sifted rye bread) and ''tvebakker'' (wheat [[biscuits]]), as well as unleavened bread types: ''fladbrød'' (wheat, rye, oats, bran in various combinations) and [[wafer]]s.

===Today===
In the late 19th century, Danish bakers in the larger towns created the idea of freshly baked bread in the morning (morgenbrød) in various shapes and with a variety of seasonings, baked from wheat intended for the rising [[bourgeoisie]]. Since then, freshly baked bread has been produced in every Danish baker’s shop together with all the other kinds of bread. This decentralised form of baking bread alongside the industrialised production of bread seems to be characteristic of the Danish bread sector. The quality of Danish bread declined in the latter part of the 20th century, but it has dramatically recovered during the past 20 years due to many factors: a growing interest in bread, criticism from [[gastronome]]s, the marketing of better quality flour, better baking [[entrepreneurship]], top restaurants baking their own bread and, last but not least, inspiration from [[immigrant]]s. Consumption has to a great extent switched from rye bread to wheat bread.

===21st century innovations===
'''New types of flour''' have played a pivotal role in the improvements in Danish bread. [[Aurion]], a Danish [[Organic food|organic]] company, has spearheaded these improvements by obtaining interesting types of grain from many sources, e.g. The [[Nordic Gene Bank]] and a few grain types found in an old [[farmhouse]]. This strategy has resulted in the marketing of organic flour made from emmer, einkorn, spelt, [[kamut]], ølandshvede, [[durum]] and svedjerug.

'''New bakers''' – The baker’s traditional [[monopoly]] in delivering fresh baked bread has been challenged by [[petrol station]] outlets selling good quality bake-off bread.

===History===
[[Image:Reikäleipä view from above.jpg|thumb|Ruisreikäleipä]]
Centuries ago, bread was an important part of the daily meal; for the poorest [[household]]s, it was the only meal of the day.

Cultivated varieties were barley, which is the oldest cultivated grain, followed by rye and oat; all used for [[porridge]] and baking. When grain was scarce, people used many different types of [[tree bark]] such as [[birch]] and [[pine]] as a substitute to make [[bark bread]]. Around the 10th century, wheat became a more commonly used cultivated grain, but it did not overtake rye or oats. In the Early Middle Ages, the most commonly used cultivation technique was three-shift cultivation. This type of cultivation method involved using one third of the field for autumn grain (especially rye), one third for spring grain and the rest for [[fallow]]. This approach enabled good harvests and provided good [[pasture]] for cattle. The method also guaranteed crucial grain supplies for [[bread flour]].

Finland’s cultural position between East and West has also left its mark on bread-making. Western Finland was influenced by baking and cultivation techniques from Scandinavia, whereas eastern Finland was exposed to Russian influences. 

In North [[Karelia]], in eastern Finland, households baked their bread in large ovens several times a week and the bread was eaten fresh. Bread was made from rye and dough heart (sourdough starter) could be hundreds of years’ old, bread raised without added [[yeast]].

In western Finland, it was not as common for bread to be baked weekly. Baking happened probably once or twice a month using barley and oats. Added yeast was used in the dough. Before baking, a small hole was made in the corner of the round, flattened bread, and after baking the bread was hung on poles suspended just below the kitchen ceiling to dry and for storage: see [[ruisreikäleipä]]. Barley, and sometimes wheat, was used in the western part of Finland. The most frequently cultivated grain was rye, followed by barley. 

Bread culture in [[central Finland]] was influenced by both the [[Eastern Finland Province|East]] and the [[Western Finland Province|West]]. Bread was also influenced to some extent by [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]]; bread was called “rieska”, but it was much thicker than Lappish rieska. Lapland was strongly influenced by both [[Swedish Lapland]] and Norway. 

The most varied bread traditions in Finland are to be found in the regions of Karelia and [[Kainuu]], where cereals have been ingeniously combined with other natural products such as [[berries]], [[fish]] and [[vegetables]]. Rice is a traditional filling in the [[Karelian pastry]] and the latest research show that this influence has a Russian origin, where rice was used in pastries as early as the 17th century.

===Today===
In the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, bread-making in the cities moved to local bakeries. Poor households baked their own bread daily in small apartments. The bread consisted of thinner, [[multigrain bread]]s, elongated ''sekaleipä'' mixed-cereal bread. Bread was made from all four of the cereals grown in Finland: wheat, rye, barley and oats, usually ground into various grades. Rye bread can be either light or dark in colour, depending on the type of flour mixture used, and it is typical for rye bread to include about 20% wheat flour. New trends and old traditions are bringing old-fashioned rye breads back to the shelves in shops. These rye breads are made entirely from rye flour and are the most common breads in the Finnish diet. Other types of sour bread are still baked in the residual heat of ovens and the longer baking time at low temperature gives the bread both a darker colour and a higher density and hardness than ordinary rye bread. A few wheat breads are still made in Finland, although most are simple buns or loaves of sliced or unsliced bread. ''[[Vesirinkeli]]'', water rings, are small, almost tasteless rings of yeast-leavened wheat bread, which resemble [[bagels]]. They are cooked in salted boiling water before being baked. Oats are the most commonly produced grain in Finland and many oat bread types are available, although they are not as popular as rye breads. The most common bread types in Finland are bread rolls or buns, “sämpylä” or flat soft bread pieces.

The potato, although a late introduction to Finland in the early 19th&amp;nbsp;century, features heavily in food culture and has found its way into many kinds of bread. Dough made with potato is usually very soft and the bread will be moister and fluffier than plain wheat or oat bread. This bread is widely used, particularly in northern Finland and Lapland.

===21st century innovations===
'''“Ruisnappi“''' – In [[Tampere]], central Finland, a large bakery has invented a rye snack, flavoured with [[Chili pepper|chilli]], [[lemon]], [[onion]] and [[garlic]]. The innovation originated from the idea of using the bread taken from the holes which were removed from traditional round [[crispbread]]s, which was considered as waste.

'''Rye hazelnut yoghurt''' – Finland has its own favorite [[yoghurt]] – rye-hazelnut. This product was developed from Finnish rye bread crumbs and yoghurt.

== Iceland ==

===History===
With the settlement of the country (around 800–900 AD), grain (barley) was brought to Iceland, cultivated and used for bread and porridge. In [[Mediaeval]] times, wheat was to some extent imported. However, it was mostly used for bread for [[Tribal chief|chief]]s and for [[oblate]]s. Grain cultivation is thought to have been abandoned before 1600 due to harsher climatic conditions, and subsequently most grains such as barley and rye were imported. Until the late 19th century, wheat was mostly bought by richer people. In the 17th century, rye and barley were the most common grains, with rye becoming more prominent in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The issue of a lack of grain was overcome in different ways in different parts of the country. In some areas, grain was made to go further using [[Dulse]] (''[[Palmaria palmata]]''; {{lang-is|söl}}), Iceland Moss (''[[Cetraria islandica]]''; IS: fjallagrös) or Irish Moss (''[[Chondrus crispus]]''; {{lang-is|fjörugrös}}) in [[compotes]] and breads, or by flattening the dough so thin that the bread became almost transparent. In the SE region ([[Skaftafellssýslur]]), locals knew how to use the lyme grass (''[[Leymus arenarius]]'') ({{lang-is|melkorn}}; sometimes called the Icelandic grain) for centuries, where it was used in compotes, bread, [[pancakes]], etc. These grain substitutes gave the bread a distinctive character. Dulse breads and biscuits can be made by mixing Dulse, rye, and Icelandic Moss in equal proportions.

Only in the last few decades has grain (barley) been cultivated. It is still cultivated on a very small scale, mostly for [[Animal feed|feed]]. Other grains, such as varieties of rye and wheat, have been cultivated, although this is still very much at an experimental stage.

It was not until the 18th century that it became common practice to make leavened rye breads. [[Sour dough]] was mostly used (older rye dough which had started to [[ferment]]). These breads were called pottbrauð (pot breads) because they were baked (or rather steamed) on a stove under a pot (upside down) – i.e. a kind of oven. Around 1900, it was common to bake these breads in sealed containers (i.e. from imported [[sweets]], today often from milk cartons). When ovens became a household item, the containers were placed in them. Where [[thermal spring]]s were available nearby, they were (and still are) used to bake these dark, moist and rather sweet breads (taking up to 24 hours). Rye breads baked in hot springs are a popular item today, being served for local consumption as well as for tourists.

In general, stock fish ({{lang-is|[[harðfiskur]]}}) was served as a bread substitute, eaten with butter on the side with almost every meal. Today, stock fish has lost its role as a bread substitute. It is however still eaten in the same way, either with or without butter. It is a popular snack, which has found a new target group within the sports food sector due to its high [[protein]] content and favourable [[amino acid]] content.

There have always been some imported breads in Iceland (as indicated by reports from the 14th century). However, these breads where mostly consumed by chiefs/richer people until the 20th century. Foreign sailors often paid for services on land with different kinds of bread (double-baked bread, [[cookies]], skonrogge, etc.).

===Today===
Most types of breads available in other Western countries are now also available in Iceland, either baked in Iceland or imported. Everyday bread is mostly made by industrial bakeries or bought at the local bakery. However, baking at home is still a common practice amongst young and older households alike, especially in connection with having guests and celebrations. Both traditional recipes and modern/new recipes are popular, with new methods replacing older ones to some extent. Of the bread types currently available, flatbrauð (flatbread) and [[laufabrauð]] (leaf bread) have the longest traditions.

Flatbrauð came in various sizes and thicknesses and was made from rye-flour and hot water. Sometimes wheat was added as well. The bread was [[Kneading|kneaded]] and flattened into a round form by a cake roller or by hand, picked and baked on a hot stove or in ashes. Before the Second World War, flatbrauð was only served with a meal. However, since then it has become a popular feature on the coffee table. Today, flatbrauð with [[hangikjöt]] ([[Smoked food|smoked]], cooked [[Sheep|lamb]], in thin slices) is often served, both in restaurants and at home.

Several types of [[fried bread]] can be categorised as traditional; laufabrauð (leaf bread), [[kleinur]] (bows), [[lummur]] (small pancakes), pönnukökur ([[crêpes]]). With the exception of laufabrauð, none of these is mentioned in written records until the late 18th century. Laufabrauð is sometimes called “snowflake bread” in English because of its intricate cut-out pattern. Through the centuries, it was probably only served to chiefs, made from wheat and sugar and fried with butter. By the 19th century, it had become a festival bread for public consumption. At the time, it was made from cheaper ingredients, barley and rye meal, and fried in sheep fat (tólg). In the late 19th century, laufabrauð was a festival bread in the north and northeast, mostly at Christmas. Since then, the tradition has spread across the whole country. Making this crispy bread is still a popular family event today and for many an essential part of the Christmas preparations. Dozens of family members or friends will often spend an entire December afternoon kneading, rolling, decorating and frying the bread, which is then kept until Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, when it is eaten with smoked lamb.

===21st century innovations===
'''“Mýbiti” (Midge bite)''' – Students from The Icelandic Academy of Arts have developed a local “[[fastfood]]” in cooperation with farmers around [[lake Mývatn]] (Midge lake). The “fastfood” is a sandwich made from rye bread that is baked in the hot springs nearby and shaped to resemble a unique [[green algae]], lakeball ({{lang-is|kúluskítur}}; ''[[Aegagropila linnaei]]''), which is found in the lake (this algae is only found in a few lakes in the world). The sandwich is then filled with local ingredients, such as smoked [[Arctic char]].

'''Rye bread ice cream''' – Café Loki in [[Reykjavík]] is an example of a [[café]]/restaurant that is experimenting with new applications of rye bread. One of its recent products is an [[ice cream]] spiced with roasted and ground rye bread (similar to krokant).

== Norway ==

===History===
Since the early history of Norway, two types of bread have been mentioned: the white wheat loafs in the homes of [[noblemen]] and the heavy loafs of coarse bread in the [[thrall]]’s cabin. Barley is the oldest grain and dominated in the mountainous northern parts of the region, while oats were most common in humid areas. Because of the cold climate, rye and wheat were cultivated only in [[southern Norway]], and [[import]]ing was necessary. Wheat products were very exclusive and primarily enjoyed by the elite on festive occasions. Wheat was also used in the holy bread in churches.

The coarse loafs were simply made from flour or crushed grain that was kneaded with hot water or some other liquid and shaped into a flat cake of dough. These cakes were placed on a flat stone beside the fire, in the ashes or on the embers of the fire. They were used as a bread plate with fish, meats and vegetables. These breads were mainly baked from barley and oats and had in common the fact that they could not be kept for more than a few days. They needed to be preserved. This led to the development of very thin, dry and crispy flatbreads ([[flatbrød]]) that could be stored for many years.

[[File:Lefserull or wrap.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Lefserull or wrap.|Lefserull or wrap]]

For festive occasions, especially Christmas, the Norwegians have a long tradition of making various kinds of very thin flatbread called [[lefse]]r, tunnbrød, kling, klining or [[krotekake]]. Both men and women participate in baking these traditional breads; one rolls the dough and the other fries on wide, flat pans ([[takke]]). Lefser can contain fine wheat, fine barley and perhaps potatoes, milk and eggs. After frying, they can be served with meat, [[sausage]]s or fish. Today, they are used for making [[wraps]] with various fillings.

In olden days, grain was ground on manually operated rotary [[quern]]s. However, during the [[Middle Ages]], [[millstone]]s powered by a [[waterwheel]] were introduced, and large amounts of grain could be ground more quickly. These mills depended on a good flow of water, which mainly occurred during the autumn and spring. These two seasons were the time for baking flatbread and lefser. Once rye began to be cultivated around 1500, the baking techniques changed to leaven breads in ovens, e.g. with sour dough and later with other leavens. The rye in oven-baked bread was often mixed with barley for economy. It was only baked once a month, or more often during the summer. During storage, these breads gradually became drier and drier, even if they were carefully wrapped in cloth or placed in grain bins. However, dry bread was also more economical and eating fresh bread was considered a luxury. A high intake of [[wholegrain bread]] has been typical of Norwegian bread eating habits for both breakfast and lunch.

A special preparation was used to make leavened oven baked bread longer-lasting. This was particularly necessary for ships’ crews on long voyages. This consisted of wholegrain balls cut in two and dried in an oven until dry and crispy. Such bread is called kavring or tvebak, meaning ‘baked twice’, and can be stored for a long time.

===Today===
These days, we are travelling more and experiencing [[globalisation]], new immigrants are bringing their cuisines, classic national and regional products are being revitalised, [[Fine dining|high-end restaurants]] for the business elite are springing up, and we are seeing a growing interest in healthy organic food.

A research report from 2008 shows that eight out of ten respondents reported eating bread for breakfast and lunch regularly. However, few of them reported eating bread for their evening meal. The report also shows that bread and bread meals have a high food cultural value in Norway. Six out of ten considered taking a packed lunch (matpakke) to work or school a good habit and something that they enjoyed.

Many new types of bread have reached the market in recent years. A high percentage of people reported eating bread types such as spelt, specialty, gourmet, and fibre/bran bread, as well as [[ciabatta]]s and [[baguette]]s, regularly, although very few reported doing so on a daily basis. Norwegian bakers now have competition from abroad. The wholegrain bread from local bakers must give way to huge lorry loads of baguettes and frozen dough offering cheaper products.

===21st century innovations===
'''Bank of recipes and information''' – In 2007, the information office for bread and cereals (Opplysningskontoret for brød og korn) was founded. Their slogan is “Bread for every meal”. Their aim is to increase the consumption of bread and cereals. They have created websites for: [[Nutrition]], Facts, Recipes, School and Press. Last year, they held an innovative competition for pupils to make the best school bread.

== Sweden ==
[[File:Swedish flatbread1 tellstrom.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Thin bread or flatbread in a contemporary square shape.|Thin bread or flatbread in a contemporary square shape.]]

===History===
Since the very beginning, bread-making has always been a male task and associated with high status in Sweden. These first breads were baked using barley flour, or perhaps wheat for thin or flat bread cakes ([[tunnbröd]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bergström, L., (2008). Gräddat. Thesis and Papers in Scientific Archaeology 9. Stockholm: Stockholms universitet (diss.).&lt;/ref&gt; Bread became an important item in the new Christian religion (AD 900) for celebrating [[Holy Communion]] (bread and wine), which emphasised bread as being both new and important.

Thin bread was baked on stones or iron plates or in a large oven, and this tradition is still in existence today.

In Medieval times (1100–1200 AD) in central and southern Sweden, rye flour was baked into soft loafs or, in the central regions, into crispbread ([[knäckebröd]], “bread which can be broken”). The crispbread was baked with a hole in the middle so that it could be threaded over a beam and stored suspended from the ceiling. From Medieval times and the introduction of the first simple watermills, these flatbreads and crispbreads were baked only once or twice a year and kept dry in a storage chamber.

[[File:Swedish knackebrod1 tellstrom.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Contemporary knäckebröd with its traditional hole.|Contemporary knäckebröd with its traditional hole.]]

Rye flour was sometimes mixed with [[pea flour]] or, in times of famine, bark. From the 18th century, it was mixed with grated potatoes to make it last longer. Oatmeal was used in southwestern Sweden to bake thin breads or flatbreads. Sour dough was used as yeast, along with yeast from beer production (from the 19th century).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell. Å., (1950). Det svenska brödet: en jämförande etnologisk-historisk undersökning. Stockholm : Svensk bageritidskrift.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1860–70, industrial pressed yeast production started to result in more voluminous bread.

In southern Sweden, rye bread was more often baked into softer and thick bread cakes ([[kavring]], “round bread”), and from the 19th century flavoured with syrup or [[molasses]]. Professional male bakers started to sell bread in the cities during the 13th century. However, in the countryside, everyday bread was baked at home by the women. Swedish recipe books dating from the 17th–18th century contain recipes of cakes, but not everyday bread, indicating that cakes were baked less often and amongst the higher echelons of society. The process of how to make everyday bread was kept among women as [[tacit knowledge]].

[[File:Nordic bread mapp tellstrom.jpg|thumb|right|Bread types in Sweden around the 1880s. Note – the boundaries between the regions fluctuated.]]

A minority group in northern Sweden in the valley of [[Övertorneå|Torneå]], known as the [[Tornedalian]]s, baked a soft bread called rieska (unleavened bread). Quite unlike other types of bread in the surrounding northern region, rieska is a type of bread that does not keep, which is why it is baked daily or weekly. The Sàmi people have also baked soft bread on stones on a more daily basis. The large Finnish minority group in Sweden has eaten a stiffer rye bread baked with sour dough.

Bread was historically served in one of two ways, either broken into pieces in a [[soup]] or dipped in a hot drink, or served in the form of butter spread on a slice of bread and served as an open sandwich.&lt;ref&gt;Keyland, N., (1919). Svensk allmogekost: Bidrag till den svenska folkhushållningens historia. Stockholm: Svenska Teknologföreningen.&lt;/ref&gt; In regions where they lacked cereals or bread, [[dried fish]] has functioned as bread. In order to make it edible, the fish was first beaten with a stone until it became soft. The fish was spread with butter and eaten like a sandwich. Potato came to replace bread as a staple food during the 19th century and bread retained its position as the main component of breakfast, but it became a side-dish to hot luncheons and dinners when potato took over the former central role of bread.&lt;ref&gt;Swahn, J.-Ö., (2000). Fil, fläsk och Falukorv. Svenska mattraditioner genom tiderna. Lund: Illustrerad historia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Figure to the right shows the bread regions that existed around 1880, according to Åke Campbell (1950), before industrialisation led to all types of bread becoming available nationwide. Throughout history, the cities have always had a wider variety of bread types, as well as more expensive and higher status bread products in the form of cakes baked with sugar, butter and [[oriental]] spices. The boundaries should not be interpreted as being definitive, as cultural ideals always tend to vary along a boundary.

===Today===
During the switch to a modern urban and industrialised society, bread types changed when large industrial bakeries introduced new soft bread, which from the early 1920s was often sweetened (sötlimpa, sweet thick bread). From then on, bread was bought from stores and bakeries, rather than baked at home, as had previously been the case. Regional variations decreased due to the transportation and marketing of bread as a national product. The consumption of bread products of various kinds has increased since the 1990s and wholegrain bread and wheat bread are the most popular. All older bread types still exist alongside the new ones, indicating the much greater variety open to individuals today than has been the case in the past. Soft bread consumption has increased by more than 60% since the 1990s, from 30&amp;nbsp;kg to 50&amp;nbsp;kg per person and year today (2007). The older types of bread are still eaten in Sweden, but today they are usually professionally baked. New international types such as [[naan]] bread, ciabatta, [[focaccia]], [[pita]] and bagels have been popular since the 1990s. 20% of Swedes are first- or second-generation immigrants and use bread both as they did in their home countries and as it is used today in contemporary Swedish normative food culture.&lt;ref&gt;Swahn, J.-Ö., (2002).

===21st century innovations===
'''Bread Ice Cream''' – In [[Grythyttan]] in central Sweden, the local ice cream and chocolate shop has invented a new ice cream. They have taken an ordinary white vanilla ice cream and flavoured it with dry crispbread of rye ([[knäckebröd]]). Small pieces of the bread are also added to the ice cream, giving it the texture of both smooth ice cream and hard and sometime soggy bites of the crispbread. The ice cream is very popular among young people.

== Similarities and diversities in Nordic breads ==
Nordic food culture in the south and east of the region comprises a tradition of baking softer rye breads. In Denmark and especially in Sweden, the soft rye bread is sweeter; in Finland, a drier sour rye bread type is traditional. Iceland has for the past hundred years imported grain to make bread, as grain is not cultivated on the island. Due to the lack of grain, local ingredients such as Dulse or Iceland Moss were sometimes used to partly replace the grain. Soft sweet rye bread has also been baked for centuries in Iceland (i.e. the rye bread baked in hot springs) – the difference is that the rye has been imported from the other Nordic countries. People in the northern regions of Norway, Sweden and Finland have a tradition of baking thin flat, crispy breads using barley. Since Medieval times, bread was only baked once or twice a year and stored in dry chambers. In central Sweden and central Finland, there is a belt where a tradition of baking thin rye bread has developed. A paradox is that amongst people in the northern sub-alpine regions of Norway, Sweden and Finland and amongst the Sámi people, bread has been baked on a weekly basis and eaten as soft bread cakes. In all Nordic countries, dried fish has been used as a bread substitute, being served buttered. Today, international bread types are mixed with the old ones, and bread is used both in food innovations such as yoghurt with bread and fastfood bread and in new meal settings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1722">'''Nurse licensure''' is the process by which various regulatory bodies, usually a [[Board of Nursing]], regulate the practice of [[nursing]] within its jurisdiction. The primary purpose of nurse licensure is to grant permission to practice as a nurse after verifying the applicant has met minimal competencies to safely perform nursing activities within nursing's scope of practice. Licensure is necessary when the regulated activities are complex, require specialized knowledge and skill and independent decision making.&lt;ref name=NCSBN&gt;{{cite web|title=About Nursing Licensure|url=https://www.ncsbn.org/247.htm|publisher=National Council of State Boards of Nursing, Inc.|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nurse licensure also provides:
*Nursing activities may only be legally performed by individuals holding a nursing license issued by the regulatory body
*Title protection: only the persons issued a license are legally permitted to use certain titles, such as [[registered nurse]], [[advanced practice registered nurse]], etc.
*In order to assure that the public is protected, authority is granted to the regulatory body to take disciplinary action in the event the licensee violate the law or any rules promulgated by the regulatory body

Nurse licensure also establishes a registry of licensed nurses, hence the term "[[Registered Nurse]]".

The first nurse licensure and registration program was initiated in 1901 in New Zealand when the [[Nurses Registration Act 1901]] was enacted into law. The first licensure laws in the United States came in 1903. In the US, applicants must successfully pass the [[NCLEX]] exam prior to being granted a license.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32318">Relatively speaking, the [[brain]] consumes an immense amount of energy in comparison to the rest of the body. The mechanisms involved in the transfer of energy from foods to neurons are likely to be fundamental to the control of brain function.&lt;ref name="alpha" /&gt; Human bodily processes, including the brain, all require both [[Nutrient|macronutrients]], as well as [[micronutrients]].&lt;ref name= bravo&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=17066209 |year=2006 |last1=Bourre |first1=JM |title=Effects of nutrients (in food) on the structure and function of the nervous system: Update on dietary requirements for brain.

Insufficient intake of selected vitamins, or certain metabolic disorders, may affect [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] by disrupting the nutrient-dependent processes within the body that are associated with the management of energy in neurons, which can subsequently affect [[synaptic plasticity]], or the ability to encode new [[Memory|memories]].&lt;ref name="alpha"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn2421 |title=Brain foods: The effects of nutrients on brain function |year=2008 |last1=Gómez-Pinilla |first1=Fernando |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=568–78 |pmid=18568016 |pmc=2805706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrients needed for memory development==

===Choline===
[[Choline]] is an [[essential nutrient]] and its primary function within the human body is the synthesis of [[Cell membrane|cellular membranes]],&lt;ref&gt;http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/othernuts/choline Choline (at Linus Paulin Inst){{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it serves other functions as well.  It is a precursor molecule to the [[neurotransmitter]] [[Acetylcholine]] which serves a wide range of functions including motor control and memory.  Choline itself has also been shown to have additional health benefits in relation to memory and choline deficiencies may be related to some liver and [[neurological disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH, da Costa KA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00246.x |title=Choline: An essential nutrient for public health |year=2009 |last1=Zeisel |first1=Steven H |last2=Da Costa |first2=Kerry-Ann |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=67 |issue=11 |pages=615–23 |pmid=19906248 |pmc=2782876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its role in cellular synthesis, choline is an important nutrient during the prenatal and early postnatal development of offspring as it contributes heavily to the development of the brain. Despite the wide range of foods that choline is found in, studies have shown that the mean choline intake of men, women and children are below the [[Adequate Intake]] levels.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH, da Costa KA"/&gt; Women, especially pregnant or lactating women, older people, and infants, are especially at risk for choline deficiency.&lt;ref name="Zeisel SH, da Costa KA"/&gt;

==B-Vitamin deficiencies and cognition==
[[B vitamins]], also known as the B-complex, are an interrelated group of nutrients which often co-occur in food. The complex consists of: [[thiamine]] (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), [[riboflavin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[niacin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pantothenic acid]] (B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Vitamin B6|pyridoxin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), [[folic acid]] (B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), [[cobalamin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[biotin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/27-40_150.pdf}}{{page needed|was " |page=27 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; B vitamins are not [[Biosynthesis|synthesized]] in the body, and thus need to be obtained from food. B-complex vitamins are water-soluble vitamins, which means that they are not stored within the body. In consequence, the B vitamins need ongoing replenishment.&lt;ref name= charlie/&gt; It is possible to identify broad cognitive effects of certain B vitamins, as they are involved in many significant [[Metabolism|metabolic processes]] within the brain.&lt;ref name="bravo" /&gt;

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (thiamine)===
This vitamin is important for the facilitation of glucose use, thus ensuring the production of energy for the brain,&lt;ref name="bravo"/&gt; and normal functioning of the nervous system, muscles and heart.&lt;ref name= "charlie"&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=16245676 |year=2005 |last1=Thompson |first1=J |title=Vitamins, minerals and supplements: Part two |volume=78 |issue=10 |pages=366–8 |journal=Community Practitioner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thiamine is found throughout mammalian nervous tissue, including the brain and [[spinal cord]].

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (niacin)===
Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as niacin, includes both [[nicotinamide]] as well as [[nicotinic acid]], both of which function in many biological [[Redox|oxidization and reduction reactions]] within the body. Niacin is involved in the synthesis of [[fatty acids]] and [[cholesterol]], known mediators of brain biochemistry, and in effect, of cognitive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4547(19990615)56:6&lt;565::AID-JNR2&gt;3.0.CO;2-H |title=Essential fatty acids are mediators of brain biochemistry and cognitive functions |year=1999 |last1=Yehuda |first1=Shlomo |last2=Rabinovitz |first2=Sharon |last3=Mostofsky |first3=David I. |journal=Journal of Neuroscience Research |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=565–70 |pmid=10374811}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pellagra]] is a niacin deficiency disease. Pellagra is classically characterized by four 4 "D's": diarrhea, [[dermatitis]], dementia, and death. Neuropsychiatric manifestations of pellagra include headache, irritability, poor concentration, anxiety, hallucinations, stupor, apathy, psychomotor unrest, photophobia, tremor, ataxia, spastic paresis, fatigue, and depression. Symptoms of fatigue and insomnia may progress to encephalophathy characterized by confusion, memory loss, and psychosis. Those afflicted with pellagra may undergo pathological alterations in the nervous system. Findings may include [[Myelin|demylenation]] and degeneration of various affected parts of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral [[nerves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=21433862 |year=1939 |last1=Zimmerman |first1=HM |title=The Pathology of the Nervous System in Vitamin Deficiencies |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=23–28.7 |pmc=2602501 |journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oral nicotinamide has been promoted as an over-the-counter drug for the treatment of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's dementia]]. Conversely, no clinically significant effect has been found for the drug, as nicotinamide administration has not been found to promote memory functions in patients with mild to moderate dementia of either Alzheimers', vascular, or fronto-temporal types. This evidence suggests that nicotinamide may treat dementia as related to pellegra, but administration does not effectively treat other types of dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s007020070011 |title=No evidence for cognitive improvement from oral nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in dementia |year=2000 |last1=Rainer |first1=M. |last2=Kraxberger |first2=E. |last3=Haushofer |first3=M. |last4=Mucke |first4=H.

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (folic acid)===
Folate and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; play a vital role in the synthesis of [[S-Adenosyl methionine|S-adenosylmethionine]], which is of key importance in the maintenance and repair of all cells, including neurons.&lt;ref name= oscar&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1865312 |year=1991 |last1=Hauck |first1=MR |title=Cognitive abilities of preschool children: Implications for nurses working with young children |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=230–5 |journal=Journal of Pediatric Nursing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, folate has been linked to the maintenance of adequate brain levels of cofactors necessary for chemicals reactions that lead to the synthesis of serotonin and catecholamine neurotransmitters.&lt;ref name= november&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/196-305_150.pdf}}{{page needed|was "|page=196 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations of blood plasma folate and [[homocysteine]] concentrations are inversely related, such that an increase in dietary folate decreases homocysteine concentration. Thus, dietary intake of folate is a major determinant of homocysteine levels within the body.&lt;ref name= quebec&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=16210710 |year=2005 |author1=Homocysteine Lowering Trialists' Collaboration |title=Dose-dependent effects of folic acid on blood concentrations of homocysteine: A meta-analysis of the randomized trials |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=806–12 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|doi=10.1093/ajcn/82.4.806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between folate and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is so interdependent that deficiency in either vitamin can result in [[megaloblastic anemia]], characterized by organic mental change.&lt;ref name= romeo&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9155210 |year=1996 |last1=Bottiglieri |first1=T |title=Folate, vitamin B12, and neuropsychiatric disorders |volume=54 |issue=12 |pages=382–90 |journal=Nutrition Reviews |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.1996.tb03851.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The link between levels of folate and altered mental function is not large, but is sufficient enough to suggest a causal association.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Deficiency in folate can cause an elevation of homocysteine within the blood,&lt;ref name="quebec"/&gt; as the clearance of homocysteine requires enzymatic action dependent on folate, and to a lesser extent, vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Elevated homocysteine has been associated with increased risk of [[Stroke|vascular events]], as well as dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=15213037 |year=2004 |last1=Quadri |first1=P |last2=Fragiacomo |first2=C |last3=Pezzati |first3=R |last4=Zanda |first4=E |last5=Forloni |first5=G |last6=Tettamanti |first6=M |last7=Lucca |first7=U |title=Homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B-12 in mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=114–22 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|doi=10.1093/ajcn/80.1.114 |doi-broken-date=2018-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences lie in the presentation of megaloblastic anemia induced by either folate or B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. Megaloblastic anemia related to deficiency in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; generally results in peripheral neuropathy, whereas folate-related anemia often results in affective, or mood disorders.&lt;ref name="romeo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.281.6247.1036 |title=The neuropsychiatry of megaloblastic anaemia |year=1980 |last1=Shorvon |first1=S D |last2=Carney |first2=M W |last3=Chanarin |first3=I |last4=Reynolds |first4=E H |journal=BMJ |volume=281 |issue=6247 |pages=1036–8 |pmid=6253016 |pmc=1714413}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurological effects are not often associated with folate-related megaloblastic anemia, although demyelinating disorders may eventually present.&lt;ref name="romeo"/&gt; In one study, mood disturbances were recorded for the majority of patients presenting with megaloblastic anemia in the absence of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; In addition, folate concentrations within blood plasma have been found to be lower in patients with both unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders when compared with control groups. In addition, depressive groups with low folate concentrations responded less well to standard [[Antidepressant|antidepressant therapy]] than did those with normal levels within plasma.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; However, replication of these findings are less robust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12042457 |year=2002 |last1=Bryan |first1=J |last2=Calvaresi |first2=E |last3=Hughes |first3=D |title=Short-term folate, vitamin B-12 or vitamin B-6 supplementation slightly affects memory performance but not mood in women of various ages |volume=132 |issue=6 |pages=1345–56 |journal=The Journal of Nutrition|doi=10.1093/jn/132.6.1345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intake of the vitamin has been linked to deficits in [[learning]] and memory, particularly within the elderly population.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; Elderly people deficient in folate may present with deficits in free recall and recognition, which suggests that levels of folate may be related to efficacy of episodic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.11.3.487 |title=Effects of serum vitamin B-sub-1-sub-2 and folate status on episodic memory performance in very old age: A population-based study |year=1996 |last1=Wahlin |first1=Åke |last2=Hill |first2=Robert D. |last3=Winblad |first3=Bengt |last4=Bäckman |first4=Lars |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=487–96 |pmid=8893317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of adequate folate may produce a form of dementia considered to be reversible with administration of the vitamin. Indeed, there is a degree of improvement in memory associated with folate treatment. In a 3-year longitudinal study of men and women aged 50–70 years with elevated homocysteine plasma concentration, researchers found that a daily oral folic acid supplementation of 800μg resulted in an increase in folate levels and a decrease in homocysteine levels within blood plasma. In addition to these results, improvements of memory, and information-processing speed, as well as slight improvements of [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] speed were observed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60109-3 |title=Effect of 3-year folic acid supplementation on cognitive function in older adults in the FACIT trial: A randomised, double blind, controlled trial |year=2007 |last1=Durga |first1=Jane |last2=Van Boxtel |first2=Martin PJ |last3=Schouten |first3=Evert G |last4=Kok |first4=Frans J |last5=Jolles |first5=Jelle |last6=Katan |first6=Martijn B |last7=Verhoef |first7=Petra |journal=The Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9557 |pages=208–216 |pmid=17240287|url=https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/portal/en/publications/effect-of-3year-folic-acid-supplementation-on-cognitive-function-in-older-adults-in-the-facit-trial-a-randomised-double-blind-controlled-trial(35d288c0-c91e-417c-b2b7-a35a0fbc8361).html |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests there is a link between homocysteine and cognitive performance. However, while the amount of cognitive improvement after treatment with folate is correlated with the severity of folate deficiency, the severity of cognitive decline is independent of the severity of folate deficiency. This suggests that the dementia observed may not be entirely related to levels folate, as there could be additional factors that were not accounted for which might have an effect.&lt;ref name= "Fioravanti"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18653121 |year=1998 |last1=Fioravanti |first1=M |last2=Ferrario |first2=E |last3=Massaia |first3=M |last4=Cappa |first4=G |last5=Rivolta |first5=G |last6=Grossi |first6=E |last7=Buckley |first7=AE |title=Low folate levels in the cognitive decline of elderly patients and the efficacy of folate as a treatment for improving memory deficits |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |journal=Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics |doi=10.1016/s0167-4943(97)00028-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because neurulation may be completed before pregnancy is recognized, it is recommended that women capable of becoming pregnant take about 400μg of folic acid from fortified foods, supplements, or a combination of the two in order to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.&lt;ref name="november"/&gt; These major anomalies in the nervous system can be reduced by 85% with systematic folate supplementation occurring before the onset of pregnancy.&lt;ref name= papa&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11475447 |year=2001 |last1=Moyers |first1=S |last2=Bailey |first2=LB |title=Fetal malformations and folate metabolism: Review of recent evidence |volume=59 |issue=7 |pages=215–24 |journal=Nutrition Reviews |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2001.tb07013.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence of Alzheimer's and other cognitive diseases has been loosely connected to deficiencies in folate. It is recommended for the elderly to consume folate through food, fortified or not, and supplements in order to reduce risk of developing the disease.&lt;ref name="oscar"/&gt;

===Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (cobalamin)===
Also known as cobalamin, B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is important for the maintenance of neurological function and psychiatric health.&lt;ref name= sierra&gt;{{cite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline |year=1998 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-06554-2 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Thiamin/306-356_150.pdf }}{{page needed|was "|page=306 |pages=1–541". which is it?|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency, also known as [[hypocobalaminemia]], often results from complications involving absorption into the body.&lt;ref name= victor&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=17043022 |year=2006 |last1=Hvas |first1=AM |last2=Nexo |first2=E |title=Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency--an update |volume=91 |issue=11 |pages=1506–12 |journal=Haematologica}}&lt;/ref&gt; An assortment of neurological effects can be observed in 75–90% of individuals of any age with clinically observable B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency. Cobalamin deficiency manifestations are apparent in the abnormalities of the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, optic nerves, and [[cerebrum]]. These abnormalities involve a progressive degeneration of [[myelin]],&lt;ref name= yankee&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5006.1394 |title=Cerebral Manifestations of Vitamin-B12 Deficiency |year=1956 |last1=Holmes |first1=J. M. |journal=BMJ |volume=2 |issue=5006 |pages=1394–8 |pmid=13374343 |pmc=2035923}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be expressed behaviorally through reports of sensory disturbances in the extremities, or motor disturbances, such as gait ataxia. Combined myelopathy and neuropathy are prevalent within a large percentage of cases. Cognitive changes may range from loss of concentration to memory loss, disorientation, and dementia. All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes. Mental symptoms are extremely variable, and include mild disorders of mood, mental slowness, and memory defect. Memory defect encompasses symptoms of [[Mental confusion|confusion]], severe agitation and depression, [[delusions]] and paranoid behavior, visual and auditory [[hallucinations]], dysphasia, violent maniacal behavior and epilepsy. It has been suggested that mental symptoms could be related to a decrease in cerebral metabolism, as caused by the state of deficiency.&lt;ref name="yankee"/&gt;

Mild to moderate cases of pernicious anemia may show poor [[Attentional control|concentration]]. In severe cases of pernicious anemia, individuals may present with various cognitive problems such as dementia, and memory loss. It is not always easy to determine whether B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency is present, especially within older adults.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt; Patients may present with violent behavior or more subtle personality changes. They may also present with vague complaints, such as fatigue or memory loss, that may be attributed to normative aging processes. Cognitive symptoms may mimic behavior in Alzheimer's and other dementias as well.

Patients deficient in B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; despite normal absorption functionality may be treated through oral administration of at least 6&amp;nbsp;µg/day of the vitamin in pill form. Patients who suffer from irreversible causes of deficiency, such as pernicious anemia or old age, will need lifelong treatment with pharmacological doses of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Strategy for treatment is dependent on the patient's level of deficiency as well as their level of cognitive functioning.&lt;ref name="victor"/&gt; Treatment for those with severe deficiency involves 1000&amp;nbsp;µg of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; administered [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscularly]] daily for one week, weekly for one month, then monthly for the rest of the patients life. The progression of neurological manifestations of cobalamin deficiency is generally gradual. As a result, early diagnosis is important or else irreversible damage may occur.&lt;ref name="sierra"/&gt; Patients who become demented usually show little to no cognitive improvement with the administration of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. There is risk that folic acid administered to those with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency may mask anemic symptoms without solving the issue at hand. In this case, patients would still be at risk for neurological deficits associated with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency-related anemia, which are not associated with anemia related to folate deficiency.&lt;ref name= zulu&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malouf|first1=R|title=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=4|pages=CD004514|authorlink2=John Grimley Evans|last2=Grimley Evans|first2=J|last3=Areosa Sastre|first3=A|last4=Malouf|first4=Reem|year=2003|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004514|pmid=14584018|chapter=Folic acid with or without vitamin B12 for cognition and dementia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18843658|date = November 2018}}

==Vitamin A deficiency and impaired memory==
[[Vitamin A]] is an essential [[nutrient]] for mammals which takes form in either [[retinol]] or the [[provitamin]] [[beta-Carotene]]. It helps regulation of cell division, cell function, genetic regulation, helps enhance the immune system, and is required for brain function, chemical balance, growth and development of the [[central nervous system]] and vision.&lt;ref name="Edem D.O"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3923/ajcn.2009.65.82 |title=Vitamin A: A Review |year=2009 |last1=Edem |first1=D.O. |journal=Asian Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=1 |pages=65–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging and cognitive disease==
Foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to decrease risk of getting Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1159/000310330 |title=Phosphatidylserine Containing ω–3 Fatty Acids May Improve Memory Abilities in Non-Demented Elderly with Memory Complaints: A Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial |year=2010 |last1=Vakhapova |first1=Veronika |last2=Cohen |first2=Tzafra |last3=Richter |first3=Yael |last4=Herzog |first4=Yael |last5=Korczyn |first5=Amos D. |journal=Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=467–74 |pmid=20523044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids, primarily [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA), which is the most prevalent omega-3 fatty acid found in neurons, have been studied extensively for use in possible prevention and therapy of Alzheimer's disease. Some studies (cross-sectional) suggest that reduced intake or low brain levels of DHA are associated with earlier development of cognitive deficits or development of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Several clinical trials suggest that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation does not have significant effects in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease—which in turn may suggest that the protective benefits of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation could depend on the scope of the disease and other confounding factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jicha|first=GA|author2=Markesbery, WR |title=Omega-3 fatty acids: potential role in the management of early Alzheimer's disease.|journal=Clinical Interventions in Aging|date=Apr 7, 2010|volume=5|pages=45–61|pmid=20396634|pmc=2854051|doi=10.2147/cia.s5231}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A diet that is rich in antioxidants will also help get rid of free radicals in the body, which could be a cause for Alzheimer's. The buildup of Beta Amyloid plaques, a marker highly associated with Alzheimer's disease, generates cell damaging free radicals. Therefore, the role of antioxidants as protectants against Alzheimer's disease has become a hot topic of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Miranda S, Opazo C, Larrondo LF, Muñoz FJ, Ruiz F, Leighton F, Inestrosa NC  | year =2000| title =The role of oxidative stress in the toxicity induced by amyloid ß-peptide in Alzheimer's disease| journal = Progress in Neurobiology | volume =62|issue =6|pages =633–648 | doi =10.1016/S0301-0082(00)00015-0|pmid =  10880853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple dietary modification, towards fewer highly processed carbohydrates and relatively more fats ad cholesterol, is likely a protective measure against Alzheimer's disease.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Additionally, [[folic acid]] has also been found to improve the memory of older people. There is some evidence that deficiency in folic acid may increase the risk of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, but there is debate about whether it lowers risk of cognitive impairment in the older population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=RJ|author2=Carter, HK |author3=Yang, Q |title=Cognitive impairment in older Americans in the age of folic acid fortification.|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=July 2007|volume=86|issue=1|pages=265–7; author reply 267–9|pmid=17616791|doi=10.1093/ajcn/86.1.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=EH|title=Folic acid, ageing, depression, and dementia.|journal=BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.)|date=Jun 22, 2002|volume=324|issue=7352|pages=1512–5|pmid=12077044|pmc=1123448|doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7352.1512}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folic acid supplementation is shown to lower blood homocysteine levels, while folic acid deficiency can lead to a condition of high levels of homocysteine (Hcy) in the bloodstream called [[hyperhomocysteinemia]] (HHcy). HHcy is related to several vascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke.

'''One-e-App''' is a Web-based system that lets families and individuals apply for multiple health, social service and other support programs from one location. One-e-App is used by consumers themselves or by staff who assist families and individuals at community clinics, hospitals, state and county agencies, food banks and other locations.  The system allows individuals to apply for a range of programs such as Medicaid, CHIP, Food Stamps (SNAP), Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, utility assistance, local health insurance expansion programs and more.&lt;ref name="SIS"&gt;Social Interest Solutions, "[https://www.socialinterest.org/Home.aspx]", retrieved 1 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  One-e-App uses [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|Mashup]] technology to integrate with county, state and other systems to permit electronic submission of applications, supporting documents and signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, John, (September–October 2009), ''Can mash-ups cure social service stove pipes?'', Government Health IT,"[http://www.govhealthit.com/news/can-mash-ups-cure-social-service-stove-pipes]", retrieved 1 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prehydrated electrons''' are free [[electron]]s that occur in water under irradiation. Usually they form complexes with water molecules and become [[hydrated electron]]s. They can also react with the bases of the [[nucleotide]]s [[Deoxyguanosine monophosphate|dGMP]] and [[Deoxyguanosine triphosphate|dTMP]] in aqueous solution. This suggests they may also react with the bases of the [[Nucleic acid double helix|DNA double helix]], ultimately breaking molecular bonds and causing DNA damage. This mechanism is hypothesized to be a cause of radiation damage to DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanche|first1=Léon|title=Biological chemistry: Beyond radical thinking, FIGURE 1.

[[Homeopathy]] is fairly common in some countries while being uncommon in others. In some countries, there are no specific legal regulations concerning the use of homeopathy, while in others, licenses or degrees in conventional medicine from accredited universities are required.

Homeopathic preparations are not effective for treating any condition.&lt;ref name=Tuomela/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baran2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladyman/&gt; Outside of the [[alternative medicine]] community, scientists have long considered homeopathy a sham&lt;ref name=aaci&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacijournal.com/content/7/1/14 |accessdate=January 15, 2013 |quote=Within the non-CAM scientific community, homeopathy has long been viewed as a sham |title=Supported by science?: What Canadian naturopaths advertise to the public}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref name=Tuomela&gt;{{cite book |author=Tuomela, R|authorlink=Raimo Tuomela |veditors=Pitt JC, Marcello P |doi=10.1007/978-94-009-3779-6_4 |series=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science |volume=98 |year=1987 |pages=83–101 |publisher=Springer |chapter=Chapter 4: Science, Protoscience, and Pseudoscience |title=Rational Changes in Science: Essays on Scientific Reasoning |isbn=978-94-010-8181-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2012&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith K |title=Homeopathy is Unscientific and Unethical |journal=Bioethics |volume=26 |issue=9 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2011.01956.x |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1035885|pages=508–512 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baran2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladyman&gt;{{cite book |author=Ladyman J |veditors=Pigliucci M, Boudry M |year=2013 |pages=48–49 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |chapter=Chapter 3: Towards a Demarcation of Science from Pseudoscience |title=Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem |quote=Yet homeopathy is a paradigmatic example of pseudoscience.

==Europe==
Regulations vary in Europe depending on the country. In Austria and Germany, no specific regulations exist, while France and Denmark mandate licenses to diagnose any illness or dispense of any product whose purpose is to treat any illness.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_EDM_TRM_2001.2.pdf |title=Legal Status of Traditional Medicine and Complementary/Alternative Medicine: A Worldwide Review|accessdate=2007-09-12 |year=2001 |format=PDF |work=World Health Organization |publisher=World Health Organization. Note that the document specifically states that it is '''not''' an official document of the WHO.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some homeopathic treatment is covered by the national insurance of several European countries, including France, some parts of the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Luxembourg. In other countries, such as Belgium and the Czech Republic, homeopathy is not covered. In Austria, public insurance requires scientific proof of effectiveness in order to reimburse medical treatments, but exceptions are made for homeopathy.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; In 2004, Germany, which formerly offered homeopathy under its public health insurance scheme withdrew this privilege, with a few exceptions. In June 2005, the Swiss Government, after a 5-year trial, withdrew insurance coverage for homeopathy and four other alternative treatments, stating that they did not meet efficacy and cost-effectiveness criteria. However, following the result of a referendum in 2009 the five therapies were reinstated for a further 6-year trial period from 2012.&lt;ref name="swissinfo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/alternative-therapies-are-put-to-the-test/29242484|title=Alternative therapies are put to the test|author=Dacey J|date=14 January 2011|publisher=swissinfo.ch|accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Homoeopathic Medicine.jpg|right|thumb|The homeopathic remedy [[arsenicum album]] derived from [[arsenic]].]]

===European Union===
In 1992, the [[European Communities|Council of the European Communities]] stated in the preamble to [[European Union directive|its directive]] that homeopathy was officially recognized in certain member states but only tolerated in others. In any case it was prescribed and used in all member states. To harmonize the market of homeopathic products, the council, by Directive 92/73/EEC directed the member states to implement certain changes in their national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31992L0073:EN:NOT|title=Council Directive 92/73/EEC of 22 September 1992 widening the scope of Directives 65/65/EEC and 75/319/EEC on the approximation of provisions laid down by Law, Regulation or Administrative Action relating to medicinal products and laying down additional provisions on homeopathic products|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directive 92/73/EEC was replaced by Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use.&lt;ref name="2001/83/EC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0083:EN:NOT|title=Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Member states are required to ensure that homeopathic products (for oral or external use) can be registered without proof of therapeutic efficacy, provided that there is a sufficient degree of dilution to guarantee the safety of the product; in particular, the product may not contain either more than one part per 10,000 of the mother tincture or more than 1/100th of the smallest dose used in mainstream medicine, with regard to active principles whose presence in a medicinal product results in the obligation to submit a doctor's prescription. In other words, the dilution must be at least D4/4X/C2, and even higher in special cases. Other homeopathic products can still be registered under the normal rules, and products such as Arnica D1 are legally available.

The labels of homeopathic products registered without proof of efficacy must include the words "homeopathic medicinal product without approved therapeutic indications" as well as "a warning advising the user to consult a doctor if the symptoms persist during the use of the medicinal product".&lt;ref name="2001/83/EC"/&gt;

====Belgium====
{{asof|2014|5|12}}, the exercise of homeopathy is in Belgium is reserved by law to only doctors, dentists and midwives, and should only be used for those indications for which the exercise is shown to be effective according to [[evidence-based medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/doc/rech_n.htm|title=Het Belgisch Staatsblad.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian Council of Ministers agreed on July 12, 2013, with the draft [[royal decree]] as proposed by the Minister of Social Affairs and Public Health [[Laurette Onkelinx]]. The law follows the recommendations of the [[Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=dmf20130712_00656625|title=Strengere regels voor beoefenen van homeopathie|work=nieuwsblad.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presscenter.org/nl/pressrelease/20130712/bescherming-van-de-patient-strikte-regels-om-homeopathie-te-beoefenen|title=Bescherming van de patiënt: strikte regels om homeopathie te beoefenen - Presscenter.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who concluded on the basis of a systematic review of the scientific literature that there is no evidence that homeopathic treatments work better than a [[placebo]]. She advised against reimbursement by the compulsory health insurance and advised that only doctors would be allowed to practice homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kce.fgov.be/sites/default/files/page_documents/kce_154a_homeopathie_in_belgi%C3%AB_0.pdf |format=PDF |title=KCE 154A: Stand van zaken van de homeopathie in België |year= 2011 |page=vii |publisher=kce.fgov.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Belgium, 81% of consultations in the area of alternative medicine involve homeopathy, either alone or in combination with other forms of alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Belgium has three homeopathic organizations for medical doctors and pharmacists and two for patients.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

====France====
Homeopathy is the most popular form of alternative medicine in France. Its use rose from 16% of the population in 1982 to 29% in 1987 and 36% in 1992.&lt;ref name="MedicineinEurope"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Fisher |first1= P |first2= A |last2= Ward |title= Medicine in Europe: Complementary medicine in Europe |journal= BMJ |volume= 309 |issue= 6947 |pages= 107–11 |date= 1994-07-09 |url= http://www.bmj.com/content/309/6947/107.full |doi= 10.1136/bmj.309.6947.107|accessdate= 2012-05-14 |pmid= 8038643 |pmc= 2540528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
In Germany, the legislation for homeopathic remedies follows European Union (EU) regulations. Homeopathic remedies are subject to registration, but they need not be tested. However, homeopathic remedies that are less diluted than D4, or for which a danger of adverse effects exists, cannot be registered under this rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/amg_1976/index.html §38 and § 39 of the German Arzneimittelgesetz] (pharmaceuticals law).&lt;/ref&gt; They can be sold [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] in pharmacies. Germany is the only member state of the EU in which homeopathic remedies based on minerals or plants, and produced only in very low quantities, do not need to be registered. In other member states only remedies individually prepared in a pharmacy are exempt.&lt;ref name="emeaworkshop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/conferenceflyers/homeopathic/50901906en.pdf|title=Report of a workshop on homeopathic medicinal products|author=European Medicines Agency|authorlink=European Medicines Agency|postscript=,}} including: {{cite web|url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/conferenceflyers/homeopathic/02_ECH.pdf|title=presentation|author=European Committee for Homeopathy's}} [links are broken]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, homeopathic remedies accounted for 3.16% of sold units in the pharmaceutical sector (1.08% of business volume); 0.48% of prescriptions covered by public health insurance were for homeopathic remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bpi.de/Default.aspx?tabindex=2&amp;tabid=304 |website= bpi.de |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 telephone survey of German adults found that 11.5% had used homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bücker |first1= B |last2= Groenewold |first2= M |last3= Schoefer |first3= Y |last4= Schäfer |first4= T |year= 2008 |title=The use of complementary alternative medicine (CAM) in 1001 German adults: Results of a population-based telephone survey |journal= Gesundheitswesen |volume= 70 |issue= 8–9 |pages= e29–36 |url= http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2008-1081505 |doi= 10.1055/s-2008-1081505 |pmid= 18785094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homeopathy accounts for 27.4% of patient contacts in the area of alternative medicine.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;

====Italy====
A survey of more than 70,000 citizens showed that approximately 4.7 million people in Italy (8.2% of the population) used homeopathy from 1997 to 1999, including being given to 7.7% children under 14 years. Homeopathy use rose from 2.5% in 1991 to 8.2% in 1999, but, despite the increase these numbers are still considered to represent comparatively light use compared to other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Menniti-Ippolito |first1= F |first2= L |last2= Gargiulo |first3= E |last3= Bologna |first4=E |last4= Forcella |first5= R |last5= Raschetti |display-authors= 2 |year= 2002 |title= Use of unconventional medicine in Italy: A nation-wide survey |journal= [[European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology]] |volume= 58 |pages= 61–4 |url= http://www.anme.info/uploads/use_of_unconventional_medicine_in_italy_it_2304.pdf |doi= 10.1007/s00228-002-0435-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain Northern Ireland|Britain]], homeopathy has been in a state of steady decline over recent years. The number of [[National Health Service]] (NHS) prescriptions for homeopathic remedies dropped by over 85% between 2000 and 2010 (from 134,000 to 16,359), with homeopathy accounting for only 0.001% of the total 2010 prescribing budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8729588/NHS-spending-on-homeopathy-prescriptions-falls-to-122000.html |newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=30 August 2011 |title= NHS spending on homeopathy prescriptions falls to £122,000 |last= Beckford |first= M.|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tunbridge Wells Homeopathic Hospital]], formerly one of four homeopathic hospitals operated by the NHS, was closed in 2009 following a drop in referrals and a review by the [[West Kent Primary Care Trust]] of funding of homeopathy.&lt;ref name= "Evidence Check2"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/45/45.pdf |title= Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy |work= Fourth Report of Session 2009–10 |last=House of Commons Science and Technology Committee  |date=20 October 2009 |publisher= parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, one of the three remaining NHS-funded homeopathic hospitals, the [[Royal London Homeopathic Hospital]], was renamed as the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine to more accurately reflect the nature of its work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/OurServices/OurHospitals/RLHIM/Pages/historyofrlhim.aspx |publisher= University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust |title= History of The Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A fifth homeopathic hospital run by the NHS, the [[Hahnemann Hospital (Liverpool)|Hahnemann Hospital in Liverpool]], had been closed in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=138-614hah&amp;cid=0#0 |publisher= National Archives |title= The Liverpool Hahnemann Hospital and Homeopathic Dispensaries including Liverpool branch of the British Homeopathic Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 up to 37% of general practitioners (GPs) used homeopathy,&lt;ref name="MedicineinEurope" /&gt; but a review carried out by West Kent NHS Primary Care Trust in 2007 found that less than 1% of registered patients were referred for homeopathic treatment, and that this was almost always at the patient's request rather than as the result of a clinical decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.westkentpct.nhs.uk/download.php?id=1428 |publisher= West Kent NHS Primary Care Trust |title= Homeopathy Commissioning Review: Conclusions &amp; Recommendation |accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the British Homeopathic Association said that 400 GPs used homeopathy in their everyday practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishhomeopathic.org/getting_treatment/homeopathy_in_the_nhs/ |publisher=BHA |title=NHS homeopathic treatment |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122052315/http://www.britishhomeopathic.org/getting_treatment/homeopathy_in_the_nhs |archivedate=November 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facultyofhomeopathy.org/media/facts_about_hom/nhs_referrals.html |publisher=Faculty of Homeopathy  |title=NHS referrals|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116192508/http://www.facultyofhomeopathy.org/media/facts_about_hom/nhs_referrals.html |archivedate=16 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Homeopathic Dental Association (BHDA) claimed to have 69 dentists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhda.co.uk/list.php|title=List of Homeopathic Dentists - British Homeopathic Dental Association|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons had 36 vets listed as members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahvs.com/findavet.htm |website=bahvs.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130151233/http://www.bahvs.com/findavet.htm |archivedate=November 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 41,000 GPs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bma.org.uk/press_centre/pressgps.jsp |publisher= [[British Medical Association]] |title= Briefing Paper – General Practitioners |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and around 24,000 registered veterinary surgeons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rcvs.org.uk/about-us/about-the-veterinary-profession/ |publisher= [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]] |title= About the veterinary profession |accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, and almost 23,000 dentists doing NHS work in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ic.nhs.uk/webfiles/publications/007_Primary_Care/Dentistry/Dental_Stats_Eng_2010_11/NHS_Dental_Statistics_for_England_2010_11_Report_v2.pdf |publisher= NHS Information Centre |title= NHS Dental statistics for England: 2010/11 |accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 there were approximately 2,000 homeopaths, who are not GPs, registered with various organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Homeopath |work= TES Growing Ambitions |url= http://growingambitions.tes.co.uk/printpdf/2577 |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic review of surveys, published in April 2013, concluded that homeopathy is used by UK medical professionals to a minor degree, and that on average referral rates are low.&lt;ref name="Perry2013"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Perry |first1= R |last2= Watson |first2= L |last3= Terry |first3= R |last4= Onakpoya |first4= I |last5= Ernst |first5= E |authorlink5=Edzard Ernst|display-authors=   |title= British general practitioners' attitudes towards and usage of homeopathy: A systematic review of surveys |journal= Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=51–63 |date=June 2013 |pmid= |pmc= |doi= 10.1111/fct.12018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2009, a few UK universities started closing or reviewing their courses on homeopathy and alternative medicine, after accusations that they were teaching pseudoscience.&lt;ref name="frean" /&gt; These courses had been attracting bad publicity and criticism for the universities teaching them.&lt;ref name="frean"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= [[The Times]] |title= Universities drop degree courses in alternative medicine |first= Alexandra |last= Frean |date=3 January 2009 |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article5614896.ece |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010 the NHS announced that junior doctors' training would no longer include placements at the [[Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= [[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location= Glasgow |title= NHS scraps doctors’ training at Scots homeopathic hospital |first= Helen |last= Puttick |date=24 April 2009 |url= http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/health/nhs-scraps-doctors-training-at-scots-homeopathic-hospital-1.1029985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 and 2013 there were only two universities left in the United Kingdom offering homeopathy degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uclan.ac.uk/information/courses/msc_homeopathy.php |publisher= University of Central Lancashire |title= Course Title: Homeopathy |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mdx.ac.uk/business/partners/uk/index.aspx |publisher= Middlesex University |title=UK Academic Partners |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010 the [[Science and Technology Select Committee]] concluded that: "the NHS should cease funding homeopathy. It also concludes that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) should not allow homeopathic product labels to make medical claims without evidence of efficacy. As they are not medicines, homeopathic products should no longer be licensed by the MHRA." Part of the conclusions state that "When the NHS funds homeopathy, it endorses it. Since the NHS Constitution explicitly gives people the right to expect that decisions on the funding of drugs and treatments are made 'following a proper consideration of the evidence', patients may reasonably form the [misleading] view [inferred from the fact of any NHS financial support] that homeopathy is an evidence-based treatment." Since no evidence of benefit was found – other than the placebo effect – the report's recommendation was that "The Government should stop allowing the funding of homeopathy on the NHS."&lt;ref name= "Evidence Check2"/&gt; The government stated that this decision would be left open to the [[Primary Care Trust]]s (PCTs), the smaller bodies in charge of regional NHS management, instead of being done by the government itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm79/7914/7914.pdf |title=Government Response to the Science and Technology Committee report 'Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy’ |date=July 2010 |format=pdf |isbn=9780101791427 |publisher=Her Majesty’s Stationery Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the [[British Medical Association]] voted three to one in favour of a motion that homeopathy should be banned from the NHS, and kept from being sold as medicine in pharmacies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jun/29/ban-homeopathy-from-nhs-doctors | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Sarah | last=Boseley | title=Ban homeopathy from NHS, say doctors | date=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, out of 104 PCTs who responded to queries, 72 said they did not fund homeopathy, with 10 of these having stopped funding homeopathy in the last four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12492742 | work=BBC News | title=Third of NHS trusts fund homeopathy | date=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 2011-2012 financial year the percentage of PCTs funding homeopathy had fallen to 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PCTs abandon funding for homeopathy |work = GPonline.com | url=http://www.gponline.com/News/article/1154606/pcts-abandon-funding-homeopathy/| accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] concluded that homeopathy sellers were engaging in false advertising regarding their claims of efficacy of homeopathic products and that at the same time they discouraged users from seeking essential treatments for conditions for which they were needed.&lt;ref name=ASA&gt;{{cite web|title=ASA adjudication on Society of Homeopaths|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2013/7/Society-of-Homeopaths/SHP_ADJ_157043.aspx|publisher=ASA|accessdate=4 July 2013|date=3 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706020223/http://asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2013/7/Society-of-Homeopaths/SHP_ADJ_157043.aspx|archivedate=6 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 it was estimated that NHS expenditure on homeopathy still amounted to about £5 million, in spite of repeated campaigns to remove homeopathy from the list of treatments paid for by the NHS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37557083|title=Why does the NHS spend money on homeopathy?|last=Triggle|first=Nick|date=2016-10-06|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, the NHS announced a policy of not funding homeopathic medicine because it is "a misuse of resources";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS to ban homeopathy and herbal medicine, as 'misuse of resources'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/21/nhs-ban-homeopathy-herbal-medicine-misuse-resources/|accessdate=July 21, 2017|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; they also called on the UK Department of Health to add homeopathic remedies to the blacklist of forbidden prescription items,&lt;ref name="bbc-blacklist"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34744858 |title=Homeopathy 'could be blacklisted' |last=Gallagher |first=James |date=2015-11-13 |work=BBC News |access-date=2017-12-05 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the NHS ceased funding homeopathic remedies in November 2017.&lt;ref name="TNHS"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Donnelly |first1=Laura |title=High Court backs NHS decision to stop funding homeopathy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/06/05/high-court-backs-nhs-decision-stop-funding-homeopathy/ |accessdate=26 August 2018 |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following guidance from [[NHS England]] management that NHS spending on homeopathic treatments should cease, and that GPs should be advised to "de-prescribe" the treatments for existing patients, the [[British Homeopathic Association]] brought a lawsuit against the NHS.

===Switzerland===
State insurance funding of homeopathy and four other alternative therapies had been withdrawn after a review in 2005, and a 2009 referendum vote called for state backed health insurance to once more pay for these therapies. In 2012 the government reinstated them for a trial period until 2017, pending an independent investigation of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the therapies.&lt;ref name="swissinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20022-swiss-recognise-alternative-medicine--for-now.html|title=Swiss recognise 'alternative' medicine – for now|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules for the registration of homeopathic remedies without a concrete field of application are more liberal in [[Switzerland]] than they are in member countries of the EU. For homeopathic medicines based on well-known low-risk substances, [[Swissmedic]], the regulatory authority, offers inexpensive registration by means of a simplified electronic registration procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Swissmedic: Rules for homeopathic medicines. [http://www.swissmedic.ch/files/pdf/Faktenblatt_Homoeopathie2.pdf German version], [http://www.swissmedic.ch/files/pdf/Aide-memoire_medicaments_homeopathiques2.pdf French version].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
According to one 1996 study, approximately 4.4% of [[Australia]]n adults have used homeopathic remedies at least once in their lives, including 1.2% that sought treatment exclusively from homeopathic practitioners.&lt;ref name="pmid8596318"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= MacLennan |first1= AH  |last2= Wilson |first2= DH |last3= Taylor |first3= AW |title= Prevalence and cost of alternative medicine in Australia |journal= Lancet |volume= 347 |issue= 9001 |pages= 569–73 |year= 1996 |pmid= 8596318 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(96)91271-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], a study detailing the use of alternative medicines by children in [[Quebec]] found that 11% of the sampled 1,911 children used alternative medicines, and 25% of those who did use alternative medicines (less than 3% of all children sampled) used homeopathy. The study also pointed out that homeopathy is more commonly used in children in Canada than in adults, of whom only 19% of alternative medicine users used homeopathy.&lt;ref name="pmid7970994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Spigelblatt |first1= L |last2= Laîné-Ammara |first2= G |last3= Pless |first3= IB |last4= Guyver |first4= A |title= The use of alternative medicine by children |journal= [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=94 |issue=6 Pt 1 |pages=811–4 |year=1994 |pmid=7970994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians who choose to use alternative medicines such as homeopathy must follow guidelines set by their province's [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada|College of Physicians and Surgeons]]. [[Health care in Canada|Provincial health care]] generally does not cover homeopathy.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;

=== United States ===
[[File:Samuel Hahnemann Monument, Scott Circle.jpg|thumb|[[Samuel Hahnemann Monument]], Washington D.C. with "Similia Similibus Curentur" - Like cures Like.]]
The [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] (FD&amp;C Act) of 1938  recognized homeopathic preparations as drugs, but with significant exceptions. A principal sponsor of the Act was New York Senator and homeopathic physician [[Royal S. Copeland|Royal Copeland]], who ensured that homeopathy's own ''Homœopathic Pharmacopœia of the United States'' (HPUS) be included, as it expressed the "self-professed quality standards" of the homeopathic profession. The finished Act thus created [[loophole]]s for the regulation of homeopathic drugs, and they are thus exempted from many of the rules regulating other drugs. The inclusion of HPUS in the Act has since been questioned by "lawyers, doctors, homeopaths, historians, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials."&lt;ref name=Junod&gt;{{cite journal |first= SW |last= Junod |url= http://www.homeowatch.org/history/reghx.html |title= An alternative perspective: Homeopathic drugs, Royal Copeland, and federal drug regulation |journal= Food and Drug Law Journal |volume= 55 |issue= 1 |pages= 161–83 |year= 2001 |doi= |pmid= 12375600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeopathic remedies are regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), which regulates manufacturing and other standards that are appropriate for homeopathic drugs, mainly through ''The Homœopathic Pharmacopœia of the United States'' (HPUS) as administered by the Homœopathic Pharmacopœia Convention of the United States and section 400.400 of the FDA ''Compliance Policy Guidance Manual''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074360.htm|title=CPG Sec. 400.400 Conditions Under Which Homeopathic Drugs May be Marketed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homeopathic drugs must be tested for scope of effect, and manufactured and labeled according to the Federal FD&amp;C Act and the HPUS before they are considered official homeopathic drugs. The last bound paper edition of HPUS was published in 1979.&lt;ref name=hpus&gt;{{cite book |title=The homoeopathic pharmacopoeia of the United States |location=Falls Church, Virginia |publisher=American Institute of Homeopathy |edition=8th |year=1979 |oclc=5880151 |author1=Pharmacopoeia Convention of the American Institute of Homeopathy |author2=American Institute of Homeopathy |author3=Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia Convention of the United States |author4=National Center for Homoeopathy (U.S.) }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been replaced by an online database available to subscribers.&lt;ref name=HPUSonline&gt;{{cite web |title= What is the HPUS Online Database?|url= http://www.hpus.com/what-is-the-hpus-online-database.php |website= hpus.com |accessdate= 2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HPUSProducts&gt;{{cite web |title= Products and Services |url= http://www.hpus.com/products-and-services.php |website= hpus.com |accessdate= 2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official homeopathic drugs can be marketed according to their classification in the HPUS. They are not regulated under the [[Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act]] of 1994. Many homeopathic drugs can be sold "over-the-counter"; however, some are classified as prescription-only under all circumstances, and some are classified as prescription-only in various low dilutions. As with all drugs, the labeling requirements are important, as that is one of the primary ways the FDA can regulate drugs. Homeopathic pharmaceutical techniques are not technologically complicated, and the drugs are generally considered to be biologically safe because they are so diluted to the point where there are no molecules from the original solution left in a dose of the final remedy.&lt;ref name=Milgrom&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Milgrom |first= LR |title= Conspicuous by its absence: The memory of water, macro-entanglement, and the possibility of homeopathy |journal= Homeopathy  |volume= 96 |issue= 3 |pages= 209–19 |year= 2007 |pmid= 17678819 |doi= 10.1016/j.homp.2007.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA makes significant [[Loophole|exemptions]] for homeopathic ''remedies'' as compared to other drugs. Here are a few:&lt;ref name=FDA-Stehlin&gt;{{cite news |first= Isadora |last= Stehlin |url= http://www.homeowatch.org/articles/fdac2.html |title= Homeopathy: Real Medicine or Empty Promises? |magazine= [[FDA Consumer]] |date= December 1996 |volume= 30 |issue= 10 |pages= 15–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, in the [[United States]], $3.1 billion were spent on homeopathic medicine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nccih.nih.gov/news/camstats/costs/costdatafs.htm |title= The Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States: Cost Data |date= July 2009 |publisher= National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health |accessdate= 2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2.3% of the persons age 18 or over had consulted a practitioner that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nccih.nih.gov/news/camstats/costs/nhsrn18.pdf |title= Costs of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and Frequency of Visits to CAM Practitioners: United States, 2007 |date= 2009-07-30 |publisher= National Center for Health Statistics |accessdate= 2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--, homeopathy is much less common, and the percentage of people seeking homeopathic treatment declined from 3.4% in 1997 to 1.7% in 2002.&lt;ref name=tindleprev&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Tindle |first1= HA |last2= Davis |first2= RB |last3= Phillips |first3= RS |last4= Eisenberg |first4= DM |title= Trends in use of complementary and alternative medicine by US adults: 1997-2002 |journal= [[Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine]] |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 42–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15712765}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; Homeopathy was first established in the United States by Hans Birch Gram&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Miller |first= Timothy |authorlink= Timothy Miller |title= America's Alternative Religions | publisher= [[State University of New York Press]] |location= Albany |year= 1995 |page= 80 |isbn= 978-0-7914-2397-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1825 and rapidly gained popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= F |last= Karst |title= Homeopathy In Illinois |journal= Caduceus |volume= 4 |issue= 2 |year= 1988 |pages= 1–33 (5)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The height of its influence was the end of the 19th century where hardly any city with over 50,000 people was without a homeopathic hospital. In 1890, there were 93 regular schools, 14 of them were fully homeopathic and 8 of them were [[Eclectic medicine|eclectic]]. In 1900, there were 121 regular schools, with 22 of them being homeopathic and 10 eclectic.&lt;ref&gt;Charles S Cameron, Homeopathy in Retrospect, Trans. Stud. Coll. Phys. Philadelp., 27, 1959, 28-33; p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;  Teaching of homeopathy in the United States declined rapidly in the 20th century. The last purely homeopathic medical school closed in 1920, although homeopathic electives continued to be offered by the Hahnemann Medical School in Philadelphia until the 1940s.&lt;ref name=homhist1&gt;

According to one study, in 1990, 0.7% of individuals used homeopathy in the year prior to being questioned; in 1997, 3.4% had used homeopathy at least once in the previous year. According to the same study, of those who used homeopathy, 31.7% had seen a homeopathic practitioner in the past year in 1990 and the number dropped to 16.5% by 1997.&lt;ref name="pmid9820257"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Eisenberg DM, Davis RB, Ettner SL, etal |title=Trends in alternative medicine use in the United States, 1990-1997: results of a follow-up national survey |journal=JAMA |volume=280 |issue=18 |pages=1569–1575 |year=1998 |pmid=9820257 |doi=10.1001/jama.280.18.1569 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FDA is seeking participants for the public hearing and written comments from all interested parties, including, but not limited to, consumers, patients, caregivers, health care professionals, patient groups, and industry.

#Are the current enforcement policies under the CPG appropriate to protect and promote public health in light of the tremendous growth in the homeopathic drug market? Are there alternatives to the current enforcement policies of the CPG that would inform FDA's regulatory oversight of drugs labeled as homeopathic? If so, please explain.
#Are there areas of [http://www.fda.gov/iceci/compliancemanuals/compliancepolicyguidancemanual/ucm074360.htm the current CPG] that could benefit from additional clarity? If so, please explain.
#Is there information regarding the regulation of homeopathic products in other countries that could inform FDA's thinking in this area?
#A large majority of human drug products labeled as homeopathic are marketed as OTC drugs.These products are available for a wide variety of indications, and many of these indications have never been considered for OTC use under a formal regulatory process.

If not, what information, including, for example, information in labeling, would allow consumers and health care providers to be better informed about products labeled as homeopathic?&lt;ref name=FR032715/&gt;

On 15 November 2016, FTC declared that homeopathic products cannot include claims of effectiveness without "competent and reliable scientific evidence." If no such evidence exists, they must state this fact clearly on their labeling, and state that the product's claims are based only on 18th-century theories that have been discarded by modern science. The agency said failure to do so would be considered a violation of the [[FTC Act]], a separate authorizing law from the FDA's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/11/ftc-issues-enforcement-policy-statement-regarding-marketing|title=FTC Issues Enforcement Policy Statement Regarding Marketing Claims for Over-the-Counter Homeopathic Drugs: Efficacy and Safety Claims Are Held to Same Standard as Other OTC Drug Claims|author=Press Release|publisher=FTC|date=15 November 2016|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The [[Wheeler–Lea Act]] of 1938 established FTC authority to regulate advertising claims of non-prescription drugs.)

===Mexico===
In [[Mexico]], homeopathy is currently integrated into the [[Healthcare in Mexico|national healthcare system]]. In 1895, a presidential decree by Gral. Porfirio Díaz established the first homeopathic school and hospital as well as regulations specifying training requirements for homeopathic doctors.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; Of those individuals who use alternative medicines,{{how many|date=February 2017}} over 26% use homeopathy.&lt;ref name="pmid15702756"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nigenda |first1=G |last2=Cifuentes |first2=E |last3=Hill |first3=W |title=Knowledge and Practice of Traditional Medicine in Mexico: A Survey of Healthcare Practitioners |journal=International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=416–420 |year=2004 |pmid=15702756 |doi=10.1179/oeh.2004.10.4.416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South America==
Some countries in [[South America]], such as [[Argentina]]&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; or [[Colombia]],&lt;ref name="homeop-col"&gt;[http://www.universidad.edu.co/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=681:solo-medicos-especializados-podran-ejercer-la-homeopatia-en-colombia&amp;catid=16:noticias&amp;Itemid=198 Sólo médicos especializados podrán ejercer la homeopatía en Colombia], ''El Observatorio de la Universidad Colombiana'',19 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; allow only professional doctors who are qualified and have graduated from a recognised [[medical school]] to practice homeopathy. Homeopathy has been regulated in other South American countries, such as [[Colombia]],&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; since the beginning of the 20th century. In [[Brazil]], homeopathy is included in the national health system, and since 1991, physicians who want to practice homeopathy must complete 2,300 hours of education prior to receiving the proper licenses.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;

==Middle East and Asia==
India has the largest homeopathic infrastructure in the world, with low estimates at about 64,000, but going as high as 300,000 practising homeopaths. In addition, there are 180 colleges teaching courses, and 7500 government clinics and 307 hospitals which dispense homeopathic remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1= RK |last1= Manchanda |first2= M |last2= Kulashreshtha |url= http://www.delhihomeo.com/paperberlin.html |title= Cost Effectiveness and Efficacy of Homeopathy in Primary Health Care Units of Government of Delhi- A study}}{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=World Health Survey, 2003 |journal=International Institute for Population Sciences |first1=P |last1=Arokiasamy |first2= M |last2= Guruswamy |first3= TK |last3= Roy |first4= H |last4= Lhungdim |url= http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/whs_hspa_book.pdf |accessdate= 2007-09-07 |display-authors= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[China]] and [[Japan]], homeopathy appears to be almost unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.naturaldatabase.com/(S(qzjrf4bie5zg1b555l0elg45))/ce/ceCourse.aspx?s=ND&amp;cs=&amp;st=0&amp;li=0&amp;pc=07-24&amp;cec=1&amp;pm=5 |title= Alternative Systems of Medicine: Homeopathy, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Ayurveda |accessdate= 2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="who_legal_status"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.paho.org/spanish/ad/ths/ev/PM-WHOTraditional_medicines_legal_status.pdf |title= WHO: Legal Status of Traditional Medicine and Complementary/Alternative Medicine: A Worldwide Review |year= 2001 |accessdate= 2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="luc_china"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.minimum.com/interviews/drlucchina.htm |title= Interview to Dr. Luc after a 3 weeks visit to china |year= 2005 |accessdate= 2008-03-21}}{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asiatic countries many times were exposed to both homeopathic and non-homeopathic ideas about medicine through invading armies that had ties to Europe. In [[Malaysia]], homeopathy was introduced during World War II by [[India]]n military personnel that formed the bulk of the British army in Asia. The French army brought early [[modern medicine]] to [[Laos]] during their 1893 invasion. In China, [[Shanghai]] had one homeopathic hospital in 1911, and had four later in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = History &amp; Status of Homoeopathy Around the World |first= Eswara |last= Das |editor-first= B. |editor-last= Jain |editor-link= B.

===Middle East===
Homeopathy is becoming popular in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) and in [[Iran]]. The UAE Ministry of Health (MOH) recognizes and regulates the practice of homeopathy in a systematic way. Both medical doctors and lay practitioners can practise homeopathy but they all should pass MOH exams which cover both medical science and homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.moh.gov.ae/new_web/altrtv_mdcin.html |website= moh.gov.ae |publisher=  |title= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Health of Iran recognizes homeopathy as a legal alternative treatment. The Iranian Homeopathic Association, formed with the permission of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health, is the reference association for providing standards of homeopathy. In Iran only medical doctors can practice homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.homeopathyiran.org |website= homeopathyiran.org |publisher= |title= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Homoeopathy came to [[India]] in early 1810, with travelers, missionaries and military personnel from the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ccrhindia.org/history_of_homoeo.asp |title= History of Homeopathy |website= CCRH Official website |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeopathy research and education is looked after by the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga &amp; Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) formed on 9 November 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry of AYUSH|title=AYUSH|url=http://ayush.gov.in/|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also takes care of educational standards in the Indian Systems of Medicines and Homoeopathy colleges and promotes research in respective fields. Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) was established as an autonomous organization at [[New Delhi]] in 1978 by [[Govt. of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ccrhindia.org/history_of_ccrh.asp |title= CCRH History |publisher= Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH)|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeopathic education is regulated by [[Central Council of Homoeopathy]] (CCH), a [[Statutory corporation|statutory body]] under the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)|Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare]], formed in 1973 through Act of Parliament is one of [[University Grants Commission (India)#Professional councils|Professional Councils]] of [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC), which monitors all higher education across India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Professional Councils |url= http://www.ugc.ac.in/inside/pcouncil.html#CCH |publisher= [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC) website |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCH also regulates the practice of registered homeopaths.

In 2007 in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] (population 166 million in 2001) there were 27,548 registered homeopathic practitioners compared with 38,950 [[Doctor of Medicine|medical doctors]] (referred to as [[allopathic medicine|allopaths]] by those practicing alternative medicine), and 59,783 [[Ayurveda|ayurvedic]] and 14,905 [[unani]] practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= National Rural Health Mission |title= State Action Plan Uttar Pradesh (2007 - 2008) |url=https://www.mohfw.nic.in/NRHM/Final_State_PIP/UP%20NRHM%20PIP_14.06.07.doc |publisher= Department of Family Welfare Uttar Pradesh |accessdate= 2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of homeopathic doctors in India increased from 105,000 in 1980 to 246,000 in 2010, and the number of homeopathic hospitals/dispensaries increased fourfold — from 1,686 in 1980 to about 7,000 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Homeopath-doctors-double-in-two-decades/articleshow/16098627.cms |title= Number of Indian homeopath doctors doubles |newspaper= Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]], homeopathy is currently regulated by the Allied Health Professions Act, 1982 (Act 63 of 1982)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahpcsa.co.za/l_act.htm|title=The Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa.|author=The Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with the Regulations to the said Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahpcsa.co.za/l_regulations.htm|title=The Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa.|author=The Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was set up to provide for the establishment of a statutory body, the  Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa (AHPCSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahpcsa.co.za|title=ahpcsa.co.za|author=The Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to regulate the homeopathic profession, amongst ten others. The AHPCSA is one of five Statutory Health Professional Councils regulating health professions in South Africa. Any person wishing to practice Homeopathy in any way whatsover within the borders of South Africa must be registered with the AHPCSA. Registration is a legal requirement and under South African Law it is a criminal offense to practice homeopathy without registration.
Homoeopathic registration in South Africa enjoys a standing, rights and privileges similar to that of conventional medical practitioners. This means that the legal scope of practice of a homeopathic practitioner is very similar to that of a conventional medical practitioner. The scope of practice includes also what would generally be applicable to Naturopathic practitioners in countries like the USA.

A Homeopathic Practitioner may diagnose, in fact being a diagnostic primary health care profession, a Homeopathic Practitioner is legally compelled to make a diagnosis and provide the appropriate ICD-10 diagnostic codes. Homeopathic Practitioners also have to be licensed to compound Homeopathic medicine and to dispense any medicine falling within their scope of practice. Both conventional pharmacology and Homoeopharmaceutics are a legal training requirement.

Training therefore is based upon the medical curriculum with Homoeopathy as the primary therapeutic focus. From this perspective it is understandable that (as for Medical Practitioners where the requirement for registration is a MBChB or equivalent) in the case of Homeopathy the requirement for registration is a master's degree in Homeopathy MTech(Hom) or equivalent.

Homoeopathic practitioners are trained diagnosticians, recognised as primary contact practitioners. It should be noted that, whereas the vast majority of international Homoeopathic schools offer skills-oriented Homoeopathic training, South Africa offers professional training at a level required for the practising of Homoeopathy as a primary contact health profession in accordance with the scope of practice of such a profession.

All private Homeopathic colleges were closed during the late 1970s by the South African Department of Health (read the History and Development of Homeopathic Education in South Africa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biocura.co.za/history_homeopathic_education_in_south_africa.html|title=Drs JP Prinsloo Inc|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing practitioners were put into a closed register and in terms of the new legislation, and medical doctors were allowed to keep practicing homeopathy regardless of their knowledge of the subject.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;{{rp|45}} Nowadays, the only training recognised by the AHPCSA is a five-year full-time master's degree in Homoeopathy offered at the [[University of Johannesburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uj.ac.za/Default.aspx?alias=www.uj.ac.za/homoeopathy |accessdate=July 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521220303/http://www.uj.ac.za/Default.aspx?alias=www.uj.ac.za%2Fhomoeopathy |archivedate=May 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Durban University of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dut.ac.za/site/awdep.asp?depnum=22609 |accessdate=July 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518063924/http://www.dut.ac.za/site/awdep.asp?depnum=22609 |archivedate=May 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The M.Tech(Hom) consists of a five-year full-time medico-scientific course based on the medical curriculum with the core focus on classical, clinical, modern and conventional Homoeopathy, Homoeopharmaceutics and ending with a masters research dissertation. Graduates are registered as Homoeopathic practitioners only after having completed their post-graduate internship.

The practice of Homeopathy in South Africa requires medical training as prerequisite. Two routes thus exist for entrance into Homeopathy, either via the medically based homeopathic master's degree course (MTech-Hom) or once a medical practitioner is registered for independent practice, by way of the Post Graduate Diploma in Homeopathy offered by the South African Faculty of Homoeopathy (SAFH).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.homeopathysouthafrica.co.za/homeopathy_education_training.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Medical practitioners may register as Homoeopathic practitioners only after successful completion of the post graduate diploma. Once registered, homeopathic practitioners may do the prescribed Compounding and Dispensing course through the University of Pretoria and thereafter apply for a License to Compound and Dispense Homeopathic Medicine&lt;ref&gt;Section 22C(5) of the Medicines and Related Substances Act, (Act 101 of 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; from the National Department of Health.&lt;blockquote&gt;
22C. Licensing

(1) Subject to the provisions of this section-

(a) the Director-General may on application in the prescribed manner and on payment of the prescribed fee issue to a medical practitioner, dentist, practitioner, nurse or other person registered under the Health Professions Act, 1974, a licence to compound and dispense medicines, on the prescribed conditions;

(5) No person shall compound or dispense a medicine unless he or she is authorised thereto in terms of the Pharmacy Act, 1974, is a veterinarian or is the holder of a licence as contemplated in subsection(1)(a).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Medicines Control Council was set up in 1965, and it put all types of medicine under the same standards. It was replaced in 1998 by the South African Medicines and Medical Devices Regulatory Authority, which placed separate procedures for registering regular and alternative medicines, in order to regulate them better.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;{{rp|45}}&lt;ref&gt;Act 132, the South African Medicines and Medical Devices Regulatory Authority Bill (64)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
Both medically qualified practitioners and lay persons can practice homeopathy, with the [[Congress of Homoeopathic Medicine Practitioners]] having 30 medical doctors on its register in 2005. The [[All-Nigeria Homeopathic Medical Organization]] was founded in 1961, and the first homeopathic practitioner, I. Okogeri, began practice the following year. The [[Nigerian College of Homoeopathic Medicine]], founded in 1972, is recognised by the government of the [[East Central State]].&lt;ref&gt;Das, E.

'''Robert Ader''' (February 20, 1932 – December 20, 2011) was an [[United States|American]] [[psychologist]] and [[academic]] who co-founded [[psychoneuroimmunology]], a field of study which explores the links connecting the [[brain]], [[behavior]], and the [[immune system]]. Ader was a [[professor emeritus]] at the [[University of Rochester Medical Center]].&lt;ref name=times /&gt;

==Early life==
Robert Ader was born on February 20, 1932 in the Bronx, New York City. He was the older of two sons of Nathan and Mae Ader.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|title= Robert Ader, Founder of Psychoneuroimmunology, Dies|url= http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/index.cfm?id=3370|work=[[University of Rochester Medical Center]]|date=December 20, 2011|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from the Horace Mann School in New York City, he attended Tulane University in New Orleans. He graduated from Tulane University with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1953. Ader then went on to earn a Ph.D. in psychology from [[Cornell University]] in 1957. After earning his Ph.D., he became a part-time instructor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Rochester and a part-time instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry. He spent his time at the University of Rochester conducting psychobiological research on animals.&lt;ref name=Papers&gt;{{cite web|title=The Papers Of Robert Ader, Ph.D.|url=https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/libraries/miner/historical_services/archives/Faculty/PapersofRobertAder.cfm|website=University of Rochester Medical Center|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Robert Ader spent his entire career at the University of Rochester, where he held many teaching and research positions.&lt;ref name=times /&gt; He was appointed the director of the Division of Behavioral and Psychosocial Medicine in the University of Rochester’s department of psychology and director of the Center for Psychoneuroimmunology Research.&lt;ref name=Psychoneuroimmunology&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychoneuroimmunology and the "Faith Factor" in Human Health|url=http://humbleapproach.templeton.org/Faith_Factor/#1|website=The Humble Approach Initiative|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired in July 2011 as professor emeritus of psychosocial medicine.&lt;ref name=times /&gt; During his career, he authored and helped coauthor over two hundred journal articles and chapters in books. He also founded the journal [[Brain, Behavior, and Immunity]] which he served as editor-in-chief for many years. He also served on editorial boards for various psychobiological and behavioral journals. In addition, he served as president of the American Psychosomatic Society from 1979 to 1982, president of the [[International Society for Developmental Psychobiology]] from 1981 to 1982, president of the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research from 1984 to 1985, and president and founder of the Psychoneuroimmunology Research Society.&lt;ref name=Papers /&gt; He also received an honorary M.D. degree from the University of Trondheim in Norway.&lt;ref name=Psychoneuroimmunology /&gt;

==Research in psychoneuroimmunology==
On beginning his career as a part-time instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester, Robert Ader focused his research on behavioral conditioning and emotional responsiveness in rats.&lt;ref name=Book&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lambert|first1=Kelly|last2=Kinsley|first2=Craig Howard|title=Clinical Neuroscience|date=2005|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-7167-5227-1|page=449|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he and a fellow researcher [[Nicholas Cohen]] were studying taste aversion in rats. The researchers gave the rats water sweetened with [[saccharin]] followed by an injection of [[cyclophosphamide]], an immunosuppressant which caused nausea.&lt;ref name=Lancet&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pincock|first1=Stephen|title=Robert Ader|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)60134-2/fulltext|website=The Lancet|publisher=Elsevier Ltd|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book page 447"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lambert|first1=Kelly|last2=Kinsley|first2=Craig Howard|title=Clinical Neuroscience|date=2005|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-7167-5227-1|page=447|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through classical conditioning, the rats learned to avoid water that contained saccharin.&lt;ref name="Book page 447" /&gt; When Ader and Cohen began to force feed the rats the saccharin solution, they noticed that the rats began to die. They also found that the rate of death was directly related to how much saccharin solution the rats consumed.&lt;ref name=Lancet /&gt;

From these findings, they proposed a theory that the rats died because the taste of saccharin by itself was enough to elicit neural signals in the rats’ brain that suppressed their immune systems as if they had been overdosed with cyclophosphamide.&lt;ref name=times /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet /&gt; Due to weakened immune systems, the rats contracted bacterial and viral infections that they were unable to fight off.&lt;ref name=times /&gt; This finding led to the belief that there are connections between the brain and the immune system which contradicted with the previous belief that the immune system was autonomous.&lt;ref name=Lancet /&gt;&lt;ref name=times /&gt; This serendipitous discovery led Robert Ader to continue research in and develop the field of [[psychoneuroimmunology]], a term that he created and first used in his 1980 presidential speech to the American Psychosomatic Society. A year later, he also used the newly created term as the title for his collection of essays that described the beginning of a new field of research.&lt;ref name=Papers /&gt;

==Later life==
Robert Ader spent 54 years at the University of Rochester until his retirement in 2011.&lt;ref name=Papers /&gt; Ader died at the Highlands at Pittsford, New York, on December 20, 2011, at the age of 79.&lt;ref name=times /&gt; His death was caused by a long illness and complications due to a fracture he obtained from a fall.&lt;ref name=times /&gt; He was married to his wife of 54 years, Gayle Ader and they had four daughters.&lt;ref name=Lancet /&gt;

'''The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists''' ('''RANZCP''') is the principal organisation representing the medical specialty of [[psychiatry]] in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] and has responsibility for training, examining and awarding the qualification of Fellowship of the College (FRANZCP) to medical practitioners.

==About==
There are currently more than 3500 Fellows of the College&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ranzcp.org/Library/Media/Australian-and-New-Zealand-Journal-of-Psychia-(62).aspx |accessdate=2012-06-29 |title=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry July 2012 |publisher=RANZCP}}&lt;/ref&gt; who account for approximately 85 per cent of all practising psychiatrists in Australia and over 50 per cent of psychiatrists in New Zealand. Over 1000 trainees are undertaking basic and advanced training to become psychiatrists in both countries.
   
The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists is a collegial community of medical specialists and trainees committed to the following core purposes: 
*Preparation of medical specialists in the field of psychiatry
*Support and enhancement of clinical practice 
*Influence and leadership across the mental health sector.

The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists's vision: 

A fellowship of psychiatrists leading the achievement of quality psychiatric care and mental health for our community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ranzcp.org/images/stories/ranzcp-attachments/Publications/RANZCP_Strategic_Plan_2012-14.pdf
|title=RANZCP }}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Australasian Association of Psychiatrists was formed on 9 October 1946. In 1962, the association resolved to "take the necessary action forthwith to convert the association into a college". and the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists was officially incorporated in Sydney on 28 October 1963. The Australasian Association of Psychiatrists was officially dissolved at a special general meeting in Melbourne on 12 April 1964. The first formal meeting of the council of the new College took place in Canberra on 25 October 1964. The meeting coincided with the College’s first annual congress.

The RANZCP was granted the Royal prefix with effect from May 1978. An extraordinary meeting of the College ratified the inclusion of "Royal" in the College’s name on 7 May 1978.&lt;ref name="Our history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ranzcp.org/about-us/our-history.html |title=Our history - RANZCP |publisher=RANZCP |deadurl=no |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Menders of the Mind'',&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt; published by Oxford University Press, commemorated the 50th anniversary of The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatry.

==Events==
The RANZCP holds several events, general psychiatry and mental health conferences.(http://www.ranzcp.org/resources/events.html)

==Training== 
The first step in becoming a psychiatrist is to undertake medical training at university and qualify as a doctor. The next step is to complete a 12-month period of intern training in a general hospital in order to become a fully registered medical practitioner and gain experience in specialist aspects of medicine and surgery. After this, interested doctors are eligible to apply for entry to the Psychiatric Training Programme, although some doctors choose to extend their general medical training before applying. Careful selection of psychiatric Trainees is conducted by a panel of psychiatrists who interview applicants in each Australian State and in New Zealand. Applicants must also provide extensive references regarding their work performance and suitability for psychiatric training. Those applicants who successfully progress through this process and satisfy all the criteria will be offered a place on the Training Programme.

Training requires mandatory supervision by experienced, qualified psychiatrists and is undertaken in approved training hospitals/services. In Australia and New Zealand, specialist postgraduate psychiatric training is conducted by the RANZCP. Training takes a minimum of five years to complete, during which time trainees work as registrars under supervision in hospitals and community clinics. They gain wide experience in dealing with the full range of psychiatric problems, including those of children and families, adults and the elderly.

'''Satiety value''', is the degree at which [[food]] gives a human the sense of food [[gratification]], the exact contrast feeling of [[hunger]]. The concept of the Satiety Value and Satiety Index  was developed by an [[Australian]] researcher and doctor, Susanna Holt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holt | first1 = SH | last2 = Miller | first2 = JC | last3 = Petocz | first3 = P | last4 = Farmakalidis | first4 = E | year = 1995 | title = A satiety index of common foods | url = | journal = Eur J Clin Nutr | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 675–690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://healthrecon.com/satiety-value/|title= The Satiety Value And Satiety Index|publisher= HealthRecon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highest satiety value is expected when the food that remains in the [[stomach]] for a longer period produces greatest functional activity of the organ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938404004482|title=Soup and satiety|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=83| issue=5|date=January 2005|pages=739–747|publisher= Elsevier|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2004.09.021|first=Richard|last=Mattes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/34/2/211.short|title=The role of dietary fiber in satiety, glucose, and insulin: studies with fruit and fruit juice|publisher=The American Society for Clinical Nutrition, Inc|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date= Feb 1981|volume=34|issue=2|pages=211–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limiting the food intake after reaching the satiety value helps reduce [[obesity]] problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/37/5/763.short|title=The effects of high and low energy density diets on satiety, energy intake, and eating time of obese and nonobese subjects|first1=K H|last1= Duncan|first2= J A |last2=Bacon|first3=R L|last3= Weinsier|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|publisher=The American Society for Clinical Nutrition, Inc|date=May 1983|volume= 37|issue=5|pages=763–767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/61/4/960S.short|title=Carbohydrates, fats, and satiety|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|publisher=The American Society for Clinical Nutrition, Inc|date= April 1995|volume=61|issue=4|pages=960S-967S|first=B J|last=Rolls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foods with great satiety value:
*[[Cabbage]] as it does not contribute much to [[weight gain]]. 
*Milk is considered as one of the rich products for higher satiety value.
*[[Green vegetables]] has the lowest satiety value when compared to milk and meat.
*Liquid foods have high satiating effect for a short period&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ernaehrungsdenkwerkstatt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/EDWText/TextElemente/Ernaehrungswissenschaft/Naehrstoffe/Saettigung_Lebensmittel_Satiety_Index.pdf|title=A satiety index of common foods|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date= Sep 1995| volume=49 | issue = 9 | pages=675–690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute''' is a permanent [[research institute]] at the [[University of Utah]] that focuses on the development of new [[scientific computing]] and [[scientific visualization|visualization]] techniques, tools, and systems with primary applications to [[biomedical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute – Home|url=http://www.sci.utah.edu/home.html|accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipson|first1=Hod|last2=Kurman|first2=Melba|title=Fabricated: The New World of 3D Printing|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|location=Indianapolis, IN|isbn=978-1118350638|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SCI Institute is noted worldwide in the [[visualization (graphics)|visualization]] community for contributions by faculty, alumni, and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shneiderman|first1=Ben|title=The New ABCs of Research: Achieving Breakthrough Collaborations|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-875883-9|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty are associated primarily with the [[University of Utah School of Computing|School of Computing]], Department of Bioengineering, Department of Mathematics, and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, with auxiliary faculty in the [[University of Utah Medical School|Medical School]] and [[University of Utah College of Architecture and Planning|School of Architecture]].

==History==
The Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute started in 1992 as a research group in the [[University of Utah School of Computing]] by [[Christopher R. Johnson|Chris Johnson]] and Rob MacLeod. In 1994 this group became the Center for Scientific Computing and Imaging, and in 2000 the name was changed to the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute. In 2007, the SCI Institute was awarded funding from [[USTAR]] to recruit more faculty in medical imaging technology. The SCI Institute was recognized as an [[Nvidia|NVIDIA]] [[CUDA]] Center of Excellence in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Humber|first1=Andrew|title=NVIDIA Recognizes University Of Utah As A Cuda Center Of Excellence|url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/io_1217508281856.html|publisher=NVIDIA|accessdate=8 April 2017|language=en-us|date=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[USTAR]] funding allowed faculty recruitment for genomic [[signal processing]] and information visualization. in 2014, [[Intel]] partnered with the SCI Institute to form the Intel Parallel Computing Center for Scientific Rendering to research and develop large scale and in situ visualization techniques for Intel hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intel® Parallel Computing Center at SCI Institute, University of Utah {{!}} Intel® Software|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-parallel-computing-center-at-sci-institute-university-of-utah|website=Intel Developer Zone|accessdate=8 April 2017|language=en|date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The overarching research objective of the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute is to conduct [[applied science|application-driven research]] in the creation of new [[scientific computing]] techniques, tools, and systems. Given the proximity and availability of research conducted at the [[University of Utah School of Medicine]], a main application focus is [[medicine]]. SCI Institute researchers also apply computational techniques to scientific and engineering sub-specialties, such as [[fluid dynamics]], [[biomechanics]], [[electrophysiology]], bioelectric fields, [[scientific visualization]], [[parallel computing]], [[inverse problems]], and [[neuroimaging]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2044">The '''Sepsis Six''' is the name given to a bundle of medical therapies designed to reduce mortality in patients with [[sepsis]]. 

Drawn from international guidelines that emerged out of the [[Surviving Sepsis Campaign]] &lt;ref&gt;Dellinger RP, Levy MM, Carlet JM, et al. (January 2008). "Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008". Intensive Care Med 34 (1): 17–60&lt;/ref&gt; the Sepsis Six was developed by The UK Sepsis Trust.&lt;ref name="sepsistrust"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sepsistrust.org/|title=Home &amp;laquo; The UK Sepsis Trust The UK Sepsis Trust|publisher=sepsistrust.org|accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Daniels, Nutbeam, Laver) in 2006 as a practical tool to help healthcare professionals deliver the basics of care rapidly and reliably.

In 2011, The UK Sepsis Trust published evidence that use of the Sepsis Six was linked to a 50% reduction in [[Mortality rate|mortality]], a decreased length of stay in hospital, and fewer [[intensive care]] days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daniels|first1=Ron|last2=Nutbeam|first2=Tim|last3=McNamara|first3=Georgina|last4=Galvin|first4=Clare|date=2011|title=The sepsis six and the severe sepsis resuscitation bundle: a prospective observational cohort study|journal=Emergency medicine journal: EMJ|volume=28|issue=6|pages=507–512|doi=10.1136/emj.2010.095067|issn=1472-0213|pmid=21036796}}&lt;/ref&gt; – findings that have since been replicated around the world.

The Sepsis Six consists of three diagnostic and three therapeutic steps – all to be delivered within one hour of the initial diagnosis of sepsis:

# Titrate [[oxygen]] to a saturation target of 94%
# Take [[blood cultures]] and consider source control
# Administer empiric intravenous [[antibiotics]]
# Measure serial serum [[Lactic acid|lactate]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s 
# Start [[intravenous fluid]] resuscitation
# Commence accurate [[urine]] output measurement.

Silt fences are widely used on construction sites in North America and elsewhere, due to their low cost and simple design.&lt;ref&gt;Sprague, C.J. (1999). "Assuring the Effectiveness of Silt Fences and Other Sediment Barriers." Proceedings of Conference 30, International Erosion Control Association, Nashville, TN. pp. 133-154.&lt;/ref&gt; However, their effectiveness in controlling sediment can be limited, due to problems with poor installation, proper placement, and/or inadequate maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brzozowski |first1=Carol |date=Nov–Dec 2006 |title=Silt Fence Installation |journal=Erosion Control |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages= |publisher=Forester Media |doi= |url=http://foresternetwork.com/daily/soil/erosion-control-devices/silt-fence-installation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and installation==
Silt fences are often perimeter controls, typically used in combination with [[sediment basin]]s and [[sediment trap (construction)|sediment trap]]s, as well as [[erosion control]]s, which are designed to retain sediment in place where soil is being disturbed by construction processes (i.e., [[land grading]] and other [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1992 |title=Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook |edition=3rd |url=http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/Water/StormwaterManagement/Erosion_Sediment_Control_Handbook/Chapter%202.pdf |publisher=Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VA DEQ) |location=Richmond, VA |chapter=Chapter 2. Erosion and Sediment Control Principles, Practices and Costs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:silt fence EPA.jpg|thumb|right|Silt fence installed on a construction site]]
[[File:Silt fence &amp; chain link support.png|thumb|Chain link supported "super" silt fence]]
A typical fence consists of a piece of [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] filter fabric (also called a [[geotextile]]) stretched between a series of wooden or metal fence stakes along a horizontal contour level. The stakes are installed on the downhill side of the fence, and the bottom edge of the fabric can be trenched into the soil and backfilled on the uphill side, although it is quite difficult to move the trenched "spoil" from the downside to the upside of the trench. The design/placement of the silt fence should create a pooling of runoff, which then allows sedimentation to occur. Water can seep through the silt fence fabric, but the fabric often becomes "blocked off" with fine soil particles (all sediment-retention devices have this challenge, and none of them "filter" storm water for very long).{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} A few hours after a storm event, the fabric can be "disturbed" in order to dislodge the fines, and allow clean water to flow through. Depending on the protected watershed and erosion, larger soil particles will settle out, ultimately filling the silt fence to the top of the structure; requiring another silt fence above or below it (creating a new ponding area), or for the silt fence to be removed, the sediment removed or spread out, and a new fence installed. The fence is not designed to concentrate or channel stormwater. The fence is installed on a site before soil disturbance begins, and is placed down-slope from the disturbance area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1992 |title=Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook |edition=3rd |url=http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/Water/StormwaterManagement/Erosion_Sediment_Control_Handbook/Chapter%203%20-%203.05.pdf |publisher=VA DEQ |section=Spec. 3-05. Silt Fence |page=III-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPAsilt"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, DC (2012). [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/siltfences.pdf "Silt Fences."] ''Stormwater Best Management Practice.'' Document no. EPA 833-F-11-008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sediment is captured by silt fences primarily through ponding of water and settling, rather than filtration by the fabric. Sand and silt tends to clog the fabric, and then the sediments settle in the temporary pond.&lt;ref name="Fifield"&gt;{{cite book |title=Designing for Effective Sediment and Erosion Control for Construction Sites |last=Fifield |first=Jerald S. |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Forester Press |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn=978-0-9707687-3-5 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.6–9}} &lt;ref name="EPA DD"&gt;{{Cite report |title=Development Document for Final Effluent Guidelines and Standards for the Construction and Development Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/construction-and-development-effluent-guidelines-documents |author=EPA |year=2009 |id=EPA-821-R-09-010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.7–46}}

===Super silt fence===
Some government jurisdictions in the [[United States]] recommend or require the use of a reinforced fence, sometimes called a "super" silt fence or an enhanced silt fence, on some construction sites.  This design uses filter fabric reinforced by a wire mesh or [[chain link fence]]. The metal backing gives the fence increased strength to resist the weight of soil and water which may be trapped by the fence in a large drainage area, and discourages construction site operators from driving vehicles over the fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1994 |title=1994 Maryland Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control |url=http://www.mde.state.md.us/assets/document/sedimentstormwater/1994ErosionSed_Section_H.pdf |section=Section H - 26.0: Super Silt Fences |publisher=Maryland Department of the Environment |location=Baltimore, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an improper installation of a super silt fence can create an inadvertent sediment basin when the filter fabric becomes clogged.  This typically causes flooding and increased downstream [[water pollution|pollution]]. Most super silt fence specifications are out-dated, requiring the trenching installation method, which has been shown to be highly susceptible to "washing out" under the fabric due to improper back-filling and inadequate compaction.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[File:Static slicing machine.png|thumb|Static slicing machine]]
===Static slicing installation===
Some [[U.S. state|state]] agencies recommend an installation technique called "static slicing" as an improved method for ensuring effectiveness and longevity of a silt fence system on a construction site. The technique involves inserting a narrow blade into the soil with a wedge-type point on its tip to slightly disrupt the soil upward, while simultaneously inserting the silt fence fabric into the slot with a moving pivot, while the machine is moving forward. This step is followed by mechanical [[soil compaction]], setting of fence posts, and attaching the fabric.&lt;ref name="EPAsilt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carpenter |first1=Thomas |last2=Sprague |first2=Joel |date=Jul–Aug 2002 |title=Silt Fence Installation Efficacy |journal=Grading and Excavation Contractor |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages= |publisher=Forester Media |url=http://foresternetwork.com/daily/construction/silt-fence-installation-efficacy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==

[http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/sw_swppp_guide.pdf “Developing Your Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan: A Guide for Construction Sites.”] Document No. EPA-833-R-060-04.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Silt fence fabrics (geotextiles) tested in laboratory settings have shown to be effective at trapping sediment particles.&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{Cite report |title="An Evaluation of the Use and Effectiveness of Temporary Sediment Controls" |url=ftp://ftp.odot.state.or.us/techserv/Geo-Environmental/Environmental/Regulatory%20Documentation%20Forms%20and%20Examples/Water%20Quality/Research%20Technical%20Documents/Barrett%20et%20al%201996.pdf |last1=Barrett |first1=Michael E. |last2=Kearney |first2=John E. |last3=McCoy |first3=Terry G. |last4=Malina |first4=Joseph F., Jr. |last5=Charbeneau |first5=Randall J. |date=March 1996  |publisher=University of Texas at Austin, Center for Transportation Research |id=Research Report 1943-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45–47}} Although there have been few field tests of silt fences installed at construction sites, these tests have shown generally poor results.&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;{{rp|27–31, 53–55}} (Effectiveness testing involved measurements for both [[total suspended solids]] and [[turbidity]].) Other studies and articles about silt fence usage and practice document problems with installation and maintenance, implying poor performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Stevens |first1=Ellen |last2=Barfield |first2=Billy J. |last3=Britton |first3=S.L. |last4=Hayes |first4=J.S. |date=2004 |title=Filter Fence Design Aid for Sediment Control at Construction Sites |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000D1LT.txt |publisher=EPA |page=22 |id=EPA/600/R-04/185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, static slicing the material into the ground has proven to be the most efficient and most effective installation method because slicing maintains the soil on both sides of the fence, and is conducive to proper compaction—which is critical to performance, as well.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 2000 the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) co-sponsored silt fence efficacy field research through its Environmental Technology Verification Program, and in general, the report found the static slicing method to be highly effective, and efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2001 |title=Environmental Technology Verification Report for Installation of Silt Fence Using the Tommy® Static Slicing Method |url=https://archive.epa.gov/nrmrl/archive-etv/web/pdf/08_vs_tommy.pdf |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Environmental Technology Evaluation Center (EvTEC); Civil Engineering Research Foundation |page= |isbn=0-7844-0565-4}} CERF Report No 40565.&lt;/ref&gt; Silt fence effectiveness is best determined by how many hundreds of pounds of sediment are contained behind a given silt fence after a storm event, and not turbidity, etc. as sediment-retention is the end goal, and not a water-quality measurement used in erosion control, for instance.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
 
Silt fences may perform poorly for a variety of reasons, including improper location (e.g. placing fence where it will not pond runoff water), improper installation (e.g. failure to adequately embed and backfill the lower edge of fabric in the soil) and lack of maintenance—fabric falling off of the posts, or posts knocked down.  A silt fence top-full of sediment may need maintenance/replacement, but it is a huge success.&lt;ref name="Fifield" /&gt;{{rp|p.6–10}} The fabric may become damaged with holes and tears if construction materials are stored next to or on top of the fence. During various phases of construction at a site, a silt fence may be removed relocated and reinstalled multiple times.&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;{{rp|30–31}} It may be difficult to maintain effectiveness of a silt fence under such operating conditions. Location of fences in areas with high flows may lead to fence failures when the installation is not adequately back-filled and properly compacted, and/or the post-spacing is inadequate.&lt;ref name="EPA DD" /&gt;{{rp|p.7–46}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6457">'''Test data exclusivity''' refers to protection of [[clinical trial]] data required to be submitted to a [[regulatory agency]] to prove safety and efficacy of a new [[drug]], and prevention of [[generic drug]] manufacturers from relying on this data in their own applications.  It provides a form of market exclusivity outside that provided by [[patent]] rights.&lt;ref name=Mossing&gt;Mossinghoff, Gerald. "[http://plg-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Overview-of-the-Hatch-Waxman-act-its-impace-on-Drug-Develo.pdf Overview of the Hatch-Waxman Act and Its Impact on the Drug Development Process.]" Food and Drug Law Journal. 54. (1999): 187-194. {{PMID|11758572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CRS2004&gt;{{cite web|title=RL32377: The Hatch-Waxman Act: Legislative Changes in the 108th Congress Affecting Pharmaceutical Patents|url=https://ipmall.law.unh.edu/sites/default/files/hosted_resources/crs/RL32377_040430.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|date=April 30, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmaceutical companies argue that since test data is so expensive to produce, it is an unfair advantage to let other companies rely on that data without cost.  Critics charge that it can act as a restriction to producing a generic copy; that although it would not raise prices of drugs, it would prevent prices from falling due to generic competition; and make it more costly for the poor to gain access to life-saving drugs (e.g. anti-HIV &amp; anti-malarial medications.) Developed countries with innovative pharmaceutical industries (including the United States) have sought data exclusivity provisions in Free Trade Agreements with their trading partners, e.g. [[DR-CAFTA]] which includes such a provision.

According to the [[European Commission]]:
:"''"Data exclusivity" refers to the period during which the data of the original [[marketing authorisation]] holder relating to (pre-) clinical testing is protected. Accordingly, in relation to marketing authorisation applications submitted after 30 October 2005 for the applications filed in the framework of national procedures or 20 November 2005 for applications filed in the framework of the centralised procedure, 'data exclusivity' refers to the eight-year protection period during which generic applicant may not refer to the information of the original marketing authorisation holder and 'marketing exclusivity' refers to the ten-year period after which generic products can be placed on the market. However, in relation to marketing authorisation applications submitted before the above mentioned dates, the wording 'data exclusivity' refers to the six or ten-year protection period granted to the original marketing authorisation (MA) holder before generic applicants can file their applications for marketing authorisation.''"&lt;ref&gt; European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/pharmaceuticals/inquiry/preliminary_report.pdf ''Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry, Preliminary Report (DG Competition Staff Working Paper)], 28 November 2008, page 17 (pdf, 1.95 MB). (See copyright notice in page 1: "Reproduction of parts of this report that are based on the Commission's own research is authorised, provided that the source is acknowledged. For material quoted in this report that is derived from other sources, permission must be sought directly from the copyright holder.") &lt;/ref&gt;

One critical issue in this regard is the issue of data exclusivity for pioneer drug companies (pharmaceutical R&amp;D organizations). From the standpoint of economics, industries where the R&amp;D process is costly and risky need longer exclusivity periods to realize innovation benefits, compared to those industries where innovation is easier and less costly. 

Some academics allege that pharmaceutical data exclusivity protection unfairly restricts the rapid public dispersal of knowledge that is supposed to be the trade-off for a grant of a patent or [[intellectual monopoly privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA, Vines T, Gibbons H. New Forms of Evergreening in Australia: Misleading Advertising, Enantiomers and Data Exclusivity (2008) 16 Journal of Law and Medicine 220-232. {{cite web |url=http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-JLM%20evergreeningapotex09.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611164212/http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-JLM%20evergreeningapotex09.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-11 |df= }}, also available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1405024&lt;/ref&gt; They allege that data exclusivity is really a form of [[evergreening]] pharmaceutical patent protection that may even restrict the capacity of governments to benefit from the granting of a [[compulsory license]] on the patents on a medicine, since the data monopoly will still prevent the marketing of generic products, even though the patent licenses have been granted by the government or a court.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA, Vines T, Gibbons H. New Forms of Evergreening in Australia: Misleading Advertising, Enantiomers and Data Exclusivity (2008) 16 Journal of Law and Medicine 220-232. {{cite web |url=http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-JLM%20evergreeningapotex09.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611164212/http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-JLM%20evergreeningapotex09.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-11 |df= }}, also available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1405024&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate criticism of data exclusivity concerns medical and research ethics.  Specifically, it is considered unethical under the [[Declaration of Helsinki]] to undertake duplicative clinical trials on human subjects.  Similar concerns have been raised in the context of test [[Information privacy|data protection]] for certain agricultural or cosmetic products, leading in some countries to proposals for cost sharing rather than exclusive rights as the form of test data protection.

==Data Exclusivity Period for human use drugs==
*United States: 5 Years for new pharmaceutical chemical entities, 3 years for new indications for pharmaceutical drugs, and 12 years for biologic products. 
*European Union: 8 Years (+ 2 Years market exclusivity + 1 year for new indication)
*Japan: 6 Years
*China: The government promised a protection period of 6 years for pharmaceutical drugs, when applying for membership to the World Trade Organization (WTO).

It is an approach for use in resource limited settings and is widely used in Africa and Asia and has been a useful research tool in studies of progression to symptomatic [[HIV]] [[disease]]. Most of these conditions are opportunistic infections that can be easily treated in healthy people. The staging system is different for adults and adolescents and children.

'''Stage I:''' HIV disease is asymptomatic and not categorized as [[AIDS]].

'''Stage II:''' include minor mucocutaneous manifestations and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections.

'''Stage III:''' includes unexplained chronic diarrhea for longer than a month, severe bacterial infections and pulmonary tuberculosis.

'''Stage IV:''' includes toxoplasmosis of the brain, candidiasis of the esophagus, trachea, bronchi or lungs and Kaposi's sarcoma; these diseases are used as indicators of AIDS.

In order to reach the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)]] concerning water and sanitation, the Ministry of Economic and Financial Development estimates that US$80 million and US$22 million, respectively are needed per year from 2006 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

No figures are available on actual investments in urban areas. Most likely, investments would have to increase manifold in order to reach the MDGs.

== Access ==

In 2015, in Benin 78% of the population had access to "improved" water, 85% and 72%, in urban and rural areas, respectively. In 2015, there were still around 2 million lacking access to "improved" water. Regarding sanitation, 20% of the population had access to "improved" sanitation, 36% and 7%, in urban and rural areas, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://washwatch.org/en/countries/benin/summary/statistics/|title=WASHwatch.org -      Benin|website=washwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Joint Monitoring Program of the [[World Health Organization]] and  [[UNICEF]], three quarters of the Beninese population had access to an [[improved water source]] in 2008, whereas 12% had access to [[improved sanitation]]. The share rose from 63% concerning water and from 5% concerning sanitation in 1990. Coverage in urban areas is considerably higher than in rural areas.&lt;ref name="JMP" /&gt;

The national government uses another definition of access,&lt;ref&gt;In rural and semi-urban areas, the water supply coverage rate represents the share of population covered by water supply points, which serve up to 250 inhabitants on the basis of 20 liters per day and capita (l/p/d) at a distance of not more than 500 meters from the place of consumption. The following sources are recognized as water points:
*A [[borehole]] equipped with a [[hand pump]] corresponds to one water point
*A modern [[Water well|well]] corresponds to one water point
*A public stand post in a rural water supply scheme corresponds to two water points
*An autonomouos water stand post (''Poste d'Eau Autonome'') corresponds to four water points

In urban and peri-urban areas, access is defined as connection to the urban water supply network. One connection provides water to on average twelve persons (two households with six persons per household). Source: {{cite journal

===Definition of urban and rural areas===
Like in other countries, the Beninese water supply sector is divided into an urban and a rural sector. However, in the documents rural areas include semi-urban areas and urban areas include peri-urban areas. In 2002, rural and semi-urban areas were defined as settlements with less than 10,000 inhabitants and 22 secondary towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants,&lt;ref name="World Bank"&gt;{{cite journal

==Service quality==

===Continuity of supply===
Substantial investments in the Greater Cotonou Area have not been effected since 1991.  The fast-growing water demand (6 – 8% p.a.) is exceeding the actual design capacity of the well fields, two treatment plants and the distribution system. This results in low [[water pressure]], which often limits the consumption in peripheral areas. Water supply in [[Cotonou]] is generally available for 24 hours per day, the system, however is badly affected by power cuts of the public energy utility (SBEE). About 50% of the power demand of pump sets can be provided through generator sets to fill the pipeline system and its [[water tower]]s. Frequent power failures reduce the reliability of the system.&lt;ref name="Thibault 48" /&gt; However, substantial extension works are financed and programmed since 2007/2008 with support of major donors ([[West African Development Bank]], [[European Investment Bank]], [[KfW Entwicklungsbank]], Netherlands). Implementation is ongoing (see below).&lt;ref name="com"/&gt;

===Drinking water quality===
There has been no broad assessment about [[water quality]] in Benin. Under the framework of a study which analyzed water supply in peri-urban areas of Cotonou, water samples were collected from water kiosks, a water seller, a communal [[Water well|well]] and [[Lake Nokoue]] in  the peri-urban Cotonouan districts of Ladji and Vossa. The study concludes that the samples from the water kiosks and the water seller were of good quality.&lt;ref name="Thibault 48" /&gt; Private water sellers connected to the SONEB utility network are widespread in urban areas, serving households not yet connected to the grid.&lt;ref name="Thibault 43" /&gt; The Ministry in charge of water and SONEB have fixed a special ‘pro-poor’ tariff for water resale to regulate this phenomenon, in July 2009. Implementation is ongoing in cooperation with local government.&lt;ref name="com"/&gt;

[[Saltwater intrusion]] has been reported close to Cotonou, where drinking water is withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Wastewater treatment===
Wastewater treatment is extremely rare in Benin. In most cases, wastewater is not even disposed appropriately. According to a 2001 national health survey, in the cities of Cotonou, [[Parakou]] and [[Porto-Novo]], only two out of 1,000 households dispose their wastewater in a correct way, while most of them discharge it directly into the nature or drains. This leads to pollution and can cause [[water-borne diseases]] like [[malaria]] and [[typhoid fever]].&lt;ref name="panapress"&gt;{{cite book

According to a 2004 article, Cotonou is the only town in Benin which has a functioning wastewater treatment plant, where sludge from [[septic tanks]] and [[latrine]]s is treated.&lt;ref name="panapress" /&gt; Another article reports that the treatment plant, operated by the private Industrial Society of Urban Equipment and Sanitation (SIBEAU) treats about 240–300 m³ per day. The company charges tariffs for treating the sludge from septic tank truckers. The wastewater receives primary and secondary treatment and is afterwards dumped into the ocean.&lt;ref name="Solo"&gt;{{cite journal

==Water use==
A study published in 2005 indicates an average consumption of 17 liters per capita and day (l/c/d) in rural areas and 29 l/c/d in cities. The authors explain the very low water use in rural areas with a lack of water sources, long distances from villages to wells and limited resources in dry seasons. In the outskirts of the town areas, they found situations similar to those in rural areas. They expect an increasing water demand due to [[urbanization]] and increasing [[Standard of living|living standards]].&lt;ref name="M'bareka 366" /&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)]] of the [[United Nations]] indicates that in 2001, 32% of the total water withdrawal was used for domestic purposes, while 45% was used for agriculture and 23% by the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History and recent developments==

===History===
'''Rural areas:''' Under the framework of the United Nations International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1981–1990), Benin launched a campaign and installed 5,350 water points. The result of these efforts revealed some weaknesses within the strategy, i.e. (i) lack of user participation in the installation of water points; (ii) lack of health and hygiene education; (iii) lack of investments in hygiene and sanitation; (iv) lack of community inclusion in the administration and operation of the water points; and (v) poor rate of functioning water points.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Economic and Financial Development" /&gt;

Since these efforts and investments in the sector had proved to be little sustainable, a new demand-responsive strategy for rural water supply and sanitation was prepared with the help of the [[World Bank]] and adopted in 1992. The strategy is based on the four principles of 
*Decentralization of decision making
*Financial contribution of the communities to the initial investments (about 3-10% of the total costs&lt;ref name="DANIDA 7"&gt;{{cite journal

  | accessdate = 2008-05-16|language=fr}}, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Search for cost-cutting measures concerning operation and maintenance of facilities
*Privatization of construction and operation activities
Furthermore, the strategy contains two more basic principles, which are not explicitly mentioned as such:
*Integration of hygiene education in rural water programs
*Redefinition of the role of the General Water Authority (DGEau), which becomes the sector regulator and facilitator
The new strategy has since then been implemented through a number of projects called Assistance Program for the Development of the Water supply and Sanitation sector in Rural areas (PADEAR) with the strong help of several development partners. The strategy was revised in 2003 in view of a new institutional framework, the national [[poverty reduction]] strategy and the MDGs, support of delegation of works and an analysis of the time which had passed since the application of the strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Urban and peri-urban areas:''' Until 2002, water and electricity were both supplied by the Beninese Society of Electricity and Water (SBEE). Afterwards, much of the electricity sector has been privatized, whereas the urban water sector remained public and has been provided by the National Water Society of Benin (SONEB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Latest national strategies===
In both urban and rural areas new strategies have been adopted in 2005 and 2006 with the objective to reach the MDGs concerning water supply by 2015.

'''Rural and semi-urban areas:''' The new strategy for the period from 2005 to 2015 follows the national strategy of 1992 and aims to reach the MDGs. Its principles are similar to those of the 1992 strategy, but adapted to the modified political and institutional frameworks. Like the former one, the strategy is based on a demand-responsive approach and has five principles:
*Decentralization of the decision-making process to the municipalities, which act based on a demand-responsive approach
*User participation in financing, operation and maintenance including rehabilitation of the facilities and construction works
*Research to find ways to reduce water tariffs through taking into consideration low cost technologies
*Privatization of construction, operation, maintenance and social mediation with a particular effort to increase the professionalism of local operators in the sector
*Reinforcement of the technical and administrative decentralization of the central administration in its role as sector regulator and establishment of functional relations between the decentralized municipal structures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In May 2004, the call for a Water Initiative for semi-urban areas which are not covered by SONEB emerged. The initiative, which has not yet been implemented in 2006 aims to reach the MDGs in these areas through the construction of rural water supply schemes in about 500 towns by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Urban and peri-urban areas:''' The 2006 to 2015 strategy for urban water supply, besides reaching the MDGs by 2015 has the objectives to facilitate the financial viability of public water supply and provide access for poorer households. The strategy is based on four principles:
*The involved actors play their respective parts in a coherent legal and institutional framework
*The achievement of the MDGs is based on a continuous and harmonious sector development
*The sustainability of the sector is backed by an economical and efficacious public water supply
*The access to water supply for people with lower incomes is a fundamental imperative of national solidarity&lt;ref name="MMEE 13"&gt;{{cite journal

Concerning '''sanitation''', the National Hygiene and Basic Sanitation Program covers the period from 2004 to 2008. It is divided into three sub-programs:
*Hygiene and basic sanitation promotion in rural areas
*Hygiene and basic sanitation promotion in urban areas
*Institutional support for the Hygiene and Basic Sanitation Authority (DHAB) under the Ministry of Health and its decentralized structures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Responsibility for water supply and sanitation==

===Policy and regulation===
[[Image:Benin-CIA WFB Map.png|200px|thumb|Map of Benin]]
The national Ministry of Energy and Water sets general water sector policies and supervises their application. National sanitation policies are defined by the Hygiene and Basic Sanitation Authority (DHAB) under the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref name=gettingafrica /&gt;

Benin is currently in the process of implementing a decentralization policy, under which water supply and sanitation becomes responsibility of the [[communes of Benin|77 municipalities]], which count between 25,000 and 600,000 inhabitants. Each municipality is headed by an elected council and a mayor. According to Law No. 97-029 of 1999 on the organization of municipalities, they have full responsibility to provide drinking water and sanitation. The law also provides for the municipalities' right to request technical assistance from the national level or the private sector. Furthermore, the national government is responsible for the transfer of the necessary financial resources for the execution of the tasks to the municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In rural and semi-urban areas, the General Water Authority (DGEau) under the Ministry of Energy and Water is expected to implement the national policies, to coordinate water use for different purposes and to promote [[Integrated Water Resources Management]]. In addition, DGEau has the task to set up and maintain a database on water resources and their mobilization. In order to ensure that the national policies are implemented at the local level, DGEau is represented by 11 Water Service divisions and uses six Department divisions of the Ministry of Energy and Water. Under the framework of decentralization, responsibilities were shifted from DGEau to its local divisions.&lt;ref name="DANIDA 12-13" /&gt;

There is no independent agency for [[economic regulation]] of the water and sanitation sector. The national 2007 Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction calls for the establishment of such an authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Economic efficiency==
[[Economic efficiency]] of water supply can be measured through several indicators. In Benin however, access to the respective data, in the case that they exist, is difficult. However, a frame contract (contrat plan) for the period 2008–2010 between SONEB and the Ministry in charge of water has been signed January 2008. It contains an indicator set  allowing to measure achievements of objectives of the urban water strategy adopted in 2007. SONEB documents these achievements in the yearly sector review.

One established indicator is the share of [[Non-revenue water|non-revenue water (NRW)]], water which is produced but not billed due to several reasons like leakage and illegal connections. According to the Beninese Ministry of Economic and Financial Development, NRW of SONEB was 21% in 2004.&lt;ref name="MMEE 9"&gt;{{cite journal

The utilities range from small ones, which serve fewer than 125,000 people to large ones, serving more than 500,000. All regions and within countries, all income levels are included. In each of the five categories (NRW, labor productivity, service coverage, water prices and connection costs and continuity of service), at least 30 utilities from developing countries and 30 from developed countries are included. The best practice targets for developing countries are based on the performance of the top 25 utilities of developing country utilities. The study uses data from the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Utilities database and the Asian Development Bank; see: {{cite journal

==Financial aspects==

===Tariffs and cost recovery===
'''Urban and peri-urban areas''' A tariff reform has been adopted in July 2009, based on a tariff study conducted in 2006. A preferential connection fee has been fixed at 50.000 CFA in the tariff system. There is no distinction between the different types of consumers (residential, commercial, industrial), but two block tariffs according to the amount of water consumption.&lt;ref name="com"/&gt;

Before the tariff reform, US$0.41 per m³ without additional taxes was charged for the first five m³. For consumption exceeding five m³, the tariff was US$1.03 including taxes per m³. The tariff structure had been active since 2002. In addition, a fixed tariff of US$0.99 for the maintenance of a [[water meter]] is added.&lt;ref name="CFA 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The document does not give information on metering coverage. However, it seems to be universal or almost universal.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a thesis, tariffs cover most of the capital costs and all operating costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Rural and semi-urban areas''' Where AUE operate and maintain the services, they are expected to bear the costs of these tasks. According to the [[DANIDA|Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA)]], the sale of water can be very profitable and cover operation and maintenance costs.&lt;ref name="DANIDA 27" /&gt; Water consumption is usually charged in the case of existing rural water supply schemes. Charging tariffs is less common if wells or hand pumps are used.&lt;ref name="DANIDA 7" /&gt; A 2004 World Bank study assumes an average rural water tariff of US$1.04 (500 CFA)&lt;ref name="CFA 2004" /&gt; per m³ and equally concludes that this tariff usually covers operation and maintenance costs, including replacement. The study also mentions that in most cases the potable water is only used for cooking and drinking and alternate sources are used for other needs. It assumes an average consumption of only 5 l/p/d from improved sources. Consequently, water tariffs are affordable for most households.&lt;ref name="World Bank 126" /&gt;

===Investment and financing===
Substantial Investments in the country's water sector have been made since the 1980s. Investments in sanitation have started much later and have been lower. Despite this, there has been no review of sector investments until 2004.&lt;ref name="World Bank"/&gt;

Since 2002, the financial resources allocated to the Ministry of Energy and Water follow a three-year program budget, focusing on a unification of all funding (operational and investment costs) and a better replicability of the expenditures and its impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | accessdate = 2008-05-16|language=fr}}, appendix 9&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to draw up a comprehensive analysis of public expenditures in the water sector. The following figures derive from a 2004 World Bank study, which uses several budgetary documents.&lt;ref&gt;The sources are:
*Public Investment Program (PIP)
*''Comptes administratifs'', prepared by the budget department of the Ministry of Finance, recording the expenditure at the payment order stage. According to the World Bank document, they have numerous inconsistencies
*2001 and 2002: Integrated System of Public Finances Administration (SIGFIP)
Investments of other ministries (e.g. Agriculture, Planning) are not included.; see: {{cite journal

The share of domestic funding increased from 9% in 1997 to 25% in 2002. However, the sector still depends strongly on external funding. Overall expenditure decreased from US$11.87 million in 1997 to US$8.57 million in 2002. The share of total government spending to the sector varied between 1.2 and 3.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Ministry of Economic and Financial Development reported in 2006 that there is no appropriate mechanism for the development of the urban water supply. External support is indispensable for the implementation of investment programs.&lt;ref name="MMEE 9" /&gt;

In 2009, the Ministry of Energy and Water and SONEB reported that [[Political corruption|corruption]] is a huge threat for the sector development. Financial resources often disappear into the pockets of politicians and contractors. Construction contracts often include inflated costs. Especially in rural areas, [[bribery]] of local officials is a common practice to ensure water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Financing the latest national strategies====
'''Rural and semi-urban areas''' The necessary financial resources to reach the MDGs in rural and semi-urban areas from 2006 to 2015 have been estimated to about US$396 million (189 billion CFA) or US$40 million per year.&lt;ref name="CFA 2006" /&gt; The Ministry of Economic and Financial Development concludes that the MDGs will not be achieved if the expenditures for the sector continue in the same amounts as in the years 2002 to 2005. However, if all available resources are mobilized, Benin will be able to reach the MDGs concerning rural water supply.&lt;ref&gt;Based on an extrapolation of the provided financial resources for the years 2006-2009; source: {{cite journal

'''Urban and peri-urban areas''' The required financial resources to finance the achievement of the MDGs in urban and peri-urban areas have been estimated to be about US$400 million (191 billion CFA) or US$40 million per year from 2006 to 2015.&lt;ref name="CFA 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | accessdate = 2008-05-21|language=fr}}, p. 18; 24&lt;/ref&gt;
The implementation of the 2006-2015 strategy to reach the MDGs in urban areas is expected to be financed by the national state, municipalities, development partners, financial institutions and SONEB. For small and medium water systems, financing will be provided by the municipalities, by the central state through public budgets, and by development 
partners. Large systems will be financed by the national state, municipalities, development banks and development agencies through credits and loans. Peri-urban areas and people with lower incomes will receive subsidies and donations with the help of development partners.

SONEB will finance investments for maintenance and rehabilitation of electromechanical installations with its own financial resources. Therefore, it is planned to improve the self-financing of SONEB through an appropriate tariff system and other measures.&lt;ref name="MMEE 13" /&gt;

'''Sanitation''' In order to achieve the MDGs concerning sanitation, the Ministry of Economic and Financial Development estimates that US$218 million (104 billion CFA) or US$22 million per year will be needed from 2006 to 2015.&lt;ref name="MEPN 24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CFA 2006" /&gt;

====Public-private partnership with small water providers in rural areas====
A key challenge faced by water authorities is how to manage their service delivery obligations to rural communities. Even in decentralized sectors the water authorities may find it hard to provide services to remote rural communities. Benin decentralized its water services in 1999 and ownership of assets and responsibility for water provision passed to the “communes” (districts). The Direction Generale D’Eau has developed a Guide for communes in developing water services for rural areas and a suite of contractual and bidding documents to be used in the different contexts discussed in this guide. The legal framework prescribes that where there is a water post with or without network connected then the communes should delegate the provision of water to a water service provider or to the water users association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=PPPIRC|title=Public-Private Partnership in Infrastructure Resource Center|url=http://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/ppp-sector/water-sanitation/small-water-providers#Water PPP Benin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==External cooperation==
The 1992 demand-responsive strategy for rural water supply and sanitation (see above) has been implemented since 1993 with the strong help of external development partners in several [[Departments of Benin|departments]]. The different programs are summarized under the Assistance Program for the Development of the Water supply and Sanitation sector in Rural areas (PADEAR).&lt;ref name="MMEE 6"&gt;{{cite journal

The Second Phase of the Water and Sanitation Sector Programme Support began in 2005 and was expected to end in 2010. The objective of the program is to reduce poverty in rural and semi-urban areas through improved water supply coverage, promotion of hygiene and basic sanitation and sustainable water resources use. The program consists of the five components sector budget support, institutional support, water supply and hygiene education, sanitation and support to the private sector. The total budget is about US$65 million ([[Danish krone|DKK]] 306.4 million).&lt;ref&gt;1 Danish Krone = US$0.21150 (2008-05-26); source: http://oanda.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Second Decentralized City Management''' Together with the French Development Agency, the World Bank contributes to the Second Decentralized City Management program, which started in 2005 and is expected to end in 2010. The program's objective is to increase access to infrastructure and basic services in the Beninese cities of Cotonou, Porto-Novo, Parakou, [[Abomey-Calavi]], [[Kandi, Benin|Kandi]] and [[Lokossa]]. Under the program, basic infrastructure including sewerage is rehabilitated and/or constructed. Community participation and integration is supported, in particular in poor neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Water and Sanitation Program''' The World Bank's multi-donor partnership Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) is active in Benin and has established a country presence in 2004. The activities focus on the implementation of a strategy to reach the MDGs, in particular in rural areas, where the WSP supports the development and implementation of a communication action plan and a maintenance pilot project. Together with other development partners, the WSP seeks to introduce a strategy for urban water supply and sanitation. In addition, the WSP helps to develop a national hand washing initiative. The WSP works in a close partnership with the World Bank's Water and Urban Unit - West Africa and national [[Aid agency|development agencies]].&lt;ref name="WSP" /&gt;

==Professional career==
In the early 19th century, the family business of William Banting of St. James’s Street, London, was among the most eminent companies of [[funeral directors]] in Britain. As [[funeral directors to the Royal Household]] itself, the Banting family conducted the funerals of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] in 1820, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] in 1830, the [[Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Duke of Gloucester]] in 1834, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] in 1852, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] in 1861, [[Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Leopold]] in 1884, [[Queen Victoria]] in 1901, and [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] in 1910. The royal undertaking warrant for the Banting family eventually ended in 1928 with the retirement of William Westport Banting.&lt;ref name=ToddVanBeck&gt;{{citation|first=Todd|last=Van Beck|title=The Death and State Funeral of Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill, part II|work=Canadian Funeral News|date=October 2012 |volume=40 |issue=10 |p=10 |url=http://www.otcommunications.com/images/issue/oct12cfn.pdf| deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316212850/http://www.otcommunications.com/images/issue/oct12cfn.pdf|archivedate=16 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weight loss diet==

===''Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public''===
In 1863, Banting wrote a booklet called ''Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public''&lt;ref name="Corpulence" /&gt; which contained the particular plan for the diet he followed. It was written as an [[open letter]] in the form of a personal testimonial. Banting accounted all of his unsuccessful fasts, diets, spa and exercise regimens in his past. His previously unsuccessful attempts had been on the advice of various medical experts. He then described the dietary change which finally had worked for him, following the advice of another medical expert.
"My kind and valued medical adviser is not a doctor for obesity, but stands on the pinnacle of fame in the treatment of another malady, which, as he well knows, is frequently induced by [corpulence]." (p24)
His own diet was four meals per day, consisting of meat, greens, fruits, and dry wine. The emphasis was on avoiding sugar, saccharine matter, starch, beer, milk and butter. Banting’s pamphlet was popular for years to come, and would be used as a model for modern diets.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Initially, he published the booklet at his personal expense. The self-published edition was so popular that he determined to sell it to the general public. The third and later editions were published by Harrison, London. Banting's booklet remains in print as of 2007, and is still available on-line.

==The word "banting"==
The popularity of the pamphlet mentioned above was such that the questions "Do you bant?" or "Are you banting?", still occasionally in use today, refer to his method, and sometimes even to dieting in general.&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt; In Sweden "banta" is still the main verb for "being on a diet". Scientist [[Tim Noakes]] popularised Banting in [[South Africa]] when he named his high-fat,  low-carbohydrate diet after Banting.&lt;ref name="bizn_Scie"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Scientist lives as hunter-gatherer: Proves Tim Noakes' Banting diet REALLY improves health | author =  | work = BizNews.com | date = 4 July 2017 | accessdate = 2018-06-05 | url = https://www.biznews.com/global-citizen/2017/07/04/tim-noakes-banting/ | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
