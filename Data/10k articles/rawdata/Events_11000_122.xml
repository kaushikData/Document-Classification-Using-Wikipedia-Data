'''Alan Mcilwraith''' (born 3 March 1978) is a former [[call centre]] worker from [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], who was exposed as a [[military imposter]] by a tabloid newspaper, after he passed himself off as a much-decorated [[British Army]] officer.

He convinced a number of charities and media outlets that he was "Captain Sir Alan Mcilwraith, [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]]". The [[National Children's Home]] charity invited him to the Women of Influence Awards at the Barony Halls. Celebrity magazine ''No1'' carried a picture of him which was captioned "Lady Shona [McLaughlan] and Sir Alan McIlwraith", showing him wearing the dress uniform of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] with medals.

==Mcilwraith's entry in Wikipedia==
&lt;!--PLEASE DON'T CHANGE THIS SECTION. It contains the full text of the original Wikipedia entry by Alan Mcilwraith, along with its spelling mistakes, hence the word "sic" at the end.--&gt;
Mcilwraith created a [[Wikipedia]] article about himself on 5 October 2005, which read as follows:

{{cquote|Captain '''Sir Alan Mcilwraith''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]] (born 03 March 1978) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[British Army|army]] officer, currently serving with the Scottish TA.  Special Force's {{sic|Force's}} Trained Capt Mcilwraith is know {{sic|throught}} the military world as a man that can get things done and thought of as a hero that the [[United Kingdom]] and [[NATO]] can look to in times of trouble.

Mcilwraith's father was an Engineer. Mcilwraith went to Shawlands Academy, in 1994 he went to [[Glasgow University]]. Mcilwraith was commissioned into the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] aged 18 finishing top in his class at [[Sandhurst Military Academy]] , specialising in the threat from [[Terrorism]].  {{sic|Serveing}} in [[Northern Ireland]],he spent two years commanding a parachute company in Northern Ireland, and later the Balkans.

In 2000s, Mcilwraith served in the [[NATO]] [[chain of command]] as an Advisor to the [[Supreme Allied Commander|Supreme Allied Commander Europe]], [[Wesley Clark|General Wesley Clark]].He is best known for risking his own life when his company was {{sic|attaked}} by a battalion to protect his men he took charge of a general purpose machine gun and held off the enemy long enough for his men to retreat. For this action he was {{sic|awared}} the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]].  He was also badly injured protecting a young woman from an angry mob without any weapons to hand he placed himself between the young woman and mob this act of heroism made him a hit within the political world.
There have been rumours that Mcilwraith stop a act of [[terrorism]] in the heart of [[London]] but these rumours are denied by both the British {{sic|Goverment}} and Capt Mcilwraith alike however he was {{sic|awared}} the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] for services to the [[United Kingdom]]

Very few Photos of Capt Mcilwraith are in circulation he is very camera shy but a splendid soldier says General [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]] [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]].}}

Mcilwraith also uploaded to Wikipedia a photograph of himself wearing military uniform and medals. The article was created from an [[IP address]] registered to [[AOL]], but Mcilwraith also apparently edited the article under the Wikipedia username MilitaryPro. On 10 October 2005 the article was tagged as needing citations for [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verification]], and on 20 October 2005 the article was tagged for [[Wikipedia:Deletion|deletion]] due to concerns about its reliability. The article was deleted three times and protected from recreation on 17 February 2006. When news of the hoax broke in April 2006 the article was revived, stating that the previous versions had been written by Mcilwraith himself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

When the article was created, Mcilwraith was described as a [[CBE]], but by December 2005 he had purportedly been elevated to the rank of [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]]. On 4 October 2005, MilitaryPro added the name of Alan Mcilwraith to the [[List of honorary British Knights]] in Wikipedia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Exposure==
Mcilwraith's double life was exposed by the Scottish tabloid newspaper the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' in an article on 11 April 2006 which described him as "Sir [[Walter Mitty]]". The newspaper contacted the British Army and [[Buckingham Palace]] during its investigation into Mcilwraith's status, but both denied knowledge of him. An Army spokesperson was quoted by the newspaper as saying, "I can confirm he is a fraud. He has never been an officer, soldier or Army cadet. May I suggest you try the space cadet organisation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16929538&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=66633&amp;headline=meet-sir-walter-mitty--name_page.html EXCLUSIVE: MEET THE REAL SIR WALTER MITTY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014712/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid%3D16929538%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D66633%26headline%3Dmeet-sir-walter-mitty--name_page.html |date=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Mcilwraith the magician===
In December 2007, the [[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|''Sunday Mail'']] reported that Mcilwraith had reinvented himself as a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] called Ledger, and claimed to be a drinking companion of [[Lance Burton]]. A spokesman for Burton (who is [[Teetotalism|teetotal]]) dismissed the report. Mcilwraith also claimed to have come second in the World Magician of the Year contest.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Mcilwraith also boasted that he used magic to bed numerous women. He said: "I must admit, magic does help attract the ladies. Women really love my magic – but when guys see them crowding round, they want to get in on the act too and muscle them out of the way. Women like any tricks to do with money. I have one where I put a pen through a note but leave it intact and they go mad for it. But I have a strict rule for women – if one asks you back to hers after midnight, always say no – you'll be too drunk and she'll turn out to be a minger."{{CQ|date=January 2018}}

When confronted by the ''Sunday Mail'', he said: "I've been very stupid. It was all lies and for that I apologise. I should have stopped lying after I got caught last time but I just really wanted to be taken seriously as a magician. I won't ever do this again."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2007/12/02/war-hero-imposter-tries-a-new-trick-as-magician-78057-20191124 "War Hero Imposter Tries A New Trick As Magician"], ''The Sunday Mail''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mcilwraith the property tycoon===
In June 2009, Mcilwraith received fresh coverage in the ''Daily Record'', which reported that he had been passing himself off as a millionaire property tycoon and charity worker to students at [[Strathclyde University]]. The paper also claimed that Mcilwraith had asked some students for disclosure documents and taken their [[National Insurance]] numbers and other details after duping them into filling in recruitment forms.

When a journalist from the ''Record'' met Mcilwraith at [[Glasgow Central Station]], he was wearing "striking blue" contact lenses. Mcilwraith claimed he was working for an agency that housed asylum seekers, denied passing himself off as a student and said that the stories of his latest tall tales had come from students getting confused after too many drinks. He stated: "I have been trying to recruit people for the company I work for but I have not been trying to do anything other than help. It's true I asked one girl about getting a disclosure but I was genuinely trying to help her along too."&lt;ref&gt;Mark McGivern,

'''''Animal Precinct''''' is an American [[documentary]] [[reality TV|reality]] [[television series]] that originally aired from June 26, 2001, to February 4, 2008, on [[Animal Planet]]. Set in New York City, the series follows the [[animal cruelty]] agents of the [[ASPCA]]'s [[ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Division|Humane Law Enforcement Division]] as they work as advocates for the five million pets and other animals in New York City, sometimes removing them from dangerous situations and pursuing [[arrests]] of those who have been accused of being cruel to animals.

The show was filmed locally by crews from [[Anglia Television]], edited in the UK and shown on [[Discovery Channel]] networks worldwide.

==Format==
When the series debuted in 2001, episodes were 30 minutes in length.  This was later extended to a full hour, and remained there for all subsequent seasons. The [[television pilot|pilot episode]] was quite different from subsequent episodes, as it focused primarily on Special Investigator [[Annemarie Lucas]] and included her discussing various parts of her job, such as how she felt about carrying a gun.

===Specials===

===="Animal Precinct at Ground Zero"====
On October 12, 2001, Animal Planet aired a one-hour special focused on the work to rescue the many animals that were affected by the fall of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] towers on September 11.&lt;ref name="APGroundZero"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charitywire.com/charity17/05206.html |title="Animal Precinct at Ground Zero" TV Show To Spotlight ASPCA During WTC Crisis |publisher=Charity Wire |date=2001-09-01 |accessdate=2008-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==
The [[ASPCA]] Humane Law Enforcement (HLE) officers can be classified as Special Agents or Special Investigators.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Many HLE officers are identified by name on-camera; however, some are not, instead spoken of only by initial (most notably "Special Agent M" and "Special Agent Q") with their faces blurred when on-camera as a way to protect their identities so that they can do [[undercover]] work for the [[ASPCA]].

During the first three seasons, the HLE team had ten investigators.  At the start of the fourth season, the team had been expanded to fifteen investigators. In season six, the team expanded again, and as of May 2008, the HLE has twenty investigators, including a female undercover agent ("Special Agent L").

In 2007, Special Investigator Annemarie Lucas was promoted to Supervisory Special Investigator.  As a result of the extra duties associated with her promotion, she does fewer street work cases, but still occasionally participates in investigations when other agents need her assistance.

===Special Agent H===
Special Agent Henry Ruiz was known as "Special Agent H" during the show's early seasons but revealed his true identity in the episode aired on July 18, 2005, after he ceased performing undercover work.  Ruiz's "unmasking" was the subject of a series of special episodes of ''Animal Precinct'', in which footage of Ruiz's past rescues was shown for the first time without the facial blurring, as well as footage from his last major undercover operation for the [[ASPCA]] (reconnaissance and surveillance of an area holding roosters bred for [[cock fighting]]) with Ruiz demonstrating and explaining his undercover techniques on-camera.  However, completed episodes filmed while Ruiz was still "Special Agent H" still have his face blurred whenever he appears on-screen.

===Diane DiGiacomo===
In 2014, Special Investigator Diane DiGiacomo was diagnosed with cancer that was directly attributed to her exposure to toxins while working as a part of animal search and rescue operations after the [[September 11 attacks]] that were depicted in the ''Animal Precinct at Ground Zero'' special. DiGiacomo died on November 20, 2015 as a result of that cancer. Although DiGiacomo's death occurred over 14 years after the attack and almost 2 years after the January 2014 dissolution of the Humane Law Enforcement Division, the [[Officer Down Memorial Page]] considers her death to be in the line of duty. This makes DiGiacomo the only known line of duty death in the history of the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odmp.org/officer/22667-special-investigator-diane-digiacomo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
The agents of the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement have full police powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lane|first1=Marion|last2=Zawistowski|first2=Stephen|title=Heritage of Care: The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|page=113|year=2008|publisher=Praeger Publishers|isbn=9780275990213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their police powers stem from a law that was written in 1866 by ASPCA founder [[Henry Bergh]]. They are certified New York State [[peace officer]]s and have statewide jurisdiction, though they only work in the confines of New York City's 5 boroughs (Manhattan, Queens, Bronx, Brooklyn, and Staten Island).

The agents of the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement have the same equipment [[NYPD]] police officers do, plus some items that are specialized for animal-related work. The agents are issued either a [[Glock 19]] [[9mm]] or a [[Smith &amp; Wesson 5906]] 9mm handgun, [[pepper spray]], [[ASP baton]], and [[handcuffs]]. Their squad cars are [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]]s, [[van]]s, and [[SUVs]]. They carry poles and cages for animal catches and seizures.

==Reception==
The success of ''Animal Precinct'' led Animal Planet to create an "[[umbrella rotation]]" of similar shows known collectively as "Animal Planet Heroes". Though the shows have similar formats, each has its own unique elements due to the differences in the ways the individual cities deal with animal care and cruelty cases.  There have currently been eight similar shows based on the ''Animal Precinct'' concept:
* ''[[Animal Cops: Detroit]]'' ([[Detroit]], [[Michigan]])
* ''[[Animal Cops: Houston]]'' ([[Houston]], [[Texas]])
* ''[[Miami Animal Police]]'' ([[Miami-Dade]], [[Florida]])
* ''[[Animal Cops: San Francisco]]'' ([[San Francisco]], [[California]])
* ''[[Animal Cops: Phoenix]] (formally "Animal Planet Heroes: Phoenix")'' ([[Phoenix, Arizona]])
* ''[[Animal Cops: South Africa]]'' ([[Cape of Good Hope]], [[South Africa]])
* ''[[Animal Cops: Philadelphia]]'' ([[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]])
* ''[[Animal Cops: Miami]]'' (also [[Miami-Dade]], [[Florida]])

In 2002, the series won the Genesis Award for the "Best Reality Programming" category.

The '''Australian Mini Challenge''' was a [[touring car racing]] category in [[Australia]]. First held in 2008, the Mini Challenge supported both the [[V8 Supercar Championship Series]] and the [[V8 Supercar Development Series]].&lt;ref name="V8"&gt;2008 V8 Supercars Eastern Creek round official event programme&lt;/ref&gt; The category is managed by [[Toleman|Toleman Motorsport]], who took over management rights following the demise of previous rights holder, Sherrin Motorsport.&lt;ref name=AUSmotive&gt;[http://www.ausmotive.com/2008/09/10/australian-mini-challenge-under-new-management.html AUSmotive.com] ''Australian Mini Challenge under new management''&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 2010, BMW announced the withdrawal of its support of the series, with the final running held at the [[2010 Sydney Telstra 500]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedcafe.com.au/2010/11/26/mini-challenge-to-end-in-2010/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403205331/http://www.speedcafe.com.au/2010/11/26/mini-challenge-to-end-in-2010/ |archivedate=2011-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Mini Challenge''' was launched by MINI Australia, being the department of BMW Group Australia responsible for the MINI brand. The National MINI Manager (General Manager of MINI brand in Australia) Justin Hocevar developed the business case, negotiated partnerships &amp; launched the series.

The first and only order of 25 vehicles from BMW Group were imported ADR and duty exempt, for the explicit use of motorsport activities. The vehicles were rushed into production &amp; arrived in Australia with little spare time for the first round, arriving via airfreight into Sydney. During their initial 'shakedown' event at Eastern Creek. The vehicles developed a technical problem with a turbo component (wastegate) which would cause the vehicles to go into 'limp-home' mode. Working through the night, local technicians liaised with technical support in Munich before a software patch was issued, a resulting modest power reduction meant the vehicles stayed below a certain heat range whereby the turbocharger wastegate component would fail.

The series was intended to support the development of the MINI brand in Australia. The purpose was to improve the masculinity / masculine appeal of the brand, to demonstrate the robustness of the vehicles and to develop the brand's performance credentials, particularly through the sub-brand JCW (John Cooper Works). As a result, the MINI brand in Australia enjoyed a high skew towards the more profitable JCW products. JCW sales in Australia ranked amongst the best-performing markets in the word.

In 2011 the series competitors were thrown a lifeline and invited to compete in the [[2011 Australian Manufacturers' Championship|Australian Manufacturers' Championship]], in a series called the AMC Mini Cup. The only changes to the rules were the requirement to run on radial tyres and the addition of a dry break fuel system to the cars for long distance events. The 2011 class pointscore was won by the only series regular Beric Lynton. Only three teams competed all season, the other two being the Sherrins Rentals team and Brendan Cook's team. All three cars never attended the same round however, with only one attending some rounds.

==The car==
The [[Mini (BMW)|R56 Mini]] hardtops were built by [[BMW]] Motorsport in [[Germany]] and flown to Australia. The Mini Challenge cars were based on the road going John Cooper works models, with a 1.6 litre, four cylinder, turbocharged engine producing 155kW (208hp). Weighing 1150kg (2535lb), the cars could accelerate to 100km/h (62mph) in just over six seconds and reach a top speed of 240km/h (149mph).&lt;ref name="V8"/&gt;

In [[physical cosmology]], '''baryogenesis''' is the hypothetical physical process that took place during the [[Big Bang|early universe]] that produced [[baryon asymmetry|baryonic asymmetry]], i.e. the imbalance of [[matter]] ([[baryon]]s) and [[antimatter]] (antibaryons) in the observed [[universe]].

Baryogenesis theories are based on different descriptions of the interaction between fundamental particles. Two main theories are [[electroweak]] baryogenesis ([[standard model]]), which would occur during the [[electroweak epoch]], and the [[Grand Unified Theory|GUT]] baryogenesis, which would occur during or shortly after the [[grand unification epoch]]. [[Quantum field theory]] and [[statistical physics]] are used to describe such possible mechanisms.

Baryogenesis is followed by primordial [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis]], when [[atomic nuclei]] began to form.

Since then, experiments have verified that every known kind of particle has a corresponding antiparticle. Under the [[CPT symmetry|CPT theorem]], a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass and lifetime, and opposite charge. Given this symmetry, it is puzzling that the universe does not have equal amounts of matter and [[antimatter]]. Indeed, there is no experimental evidence that there are any significant concentrations of antimatter in the observable universe.

There are two main interpretations for this disparity: either the universe began with a small preference for matter (total [[baryon number|baryonic number]] of the universe different from zero), or the universe was originally perfectly symmetric, but somehow a set of phenomena contributed to a small imbalance in favour of matter over time. The second point of view is preferred, although there is no clear experimental evidence indicating either of them to be the correct one.

* [[Baryon number]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; violation.
* [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] violation.
* Interactions out of [[thermal equilibrium]].

Baryon number violation is obviously a necessary condition to produce an excess of baryons over anti-baryons. But C-symmetry violation is also needed so that the interactions which produce more baryons than anti-baryons will not be counterbalanced by interactions which produce more anti-baryons than baryons. CP-symmetry violation is similarly required because otherwise equal numbers of [[Chirality (physics)#Chirality and helicity|left-handed]]  baryons and [[Chirality (physics)#Chirality and helicity|right-handed]] anti-baryons would be produced, as well as equal numbers of left-handed anti-baryons and right-handed baryons. Finally, the interactions must be out of thermal equilibrium, since otherwise [[CPT symmetry]] would assure compensation between processes increasing and decreasing the baryon number.&lt;ref name=FarrarShaposhnikov1993&gt;

Currently, there is no experimental evidence of particle interactions where the conservation of baryon number is broken [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbatively]]: this would appear to suggest that all observed particle reactions have equal baryon number before and after. Mathematically, the [[commutator]] of the baryon number [[operator (mathematics)|quantum operator]] with the (perturbative) [[Standard Model]] [[hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|hamiltonian]] is zero: &lt;math&gt;[B,H] = BH - HB = 0&lt;/math&gt;. However, the Standard Model is known to violate the conservation of baryon number only non-perturbatively: a global U(1) anomaly. To account for baryon violation in baryogenesis, such events (including proton decay) can occur in [[Grand unification theory|Grand Unification Theories]] (GUTs) and [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] (SUSY) models via hypothetical massive bosons such as the [[X and Y bosons|X boson]].

The second condition&amp;nbsp;– violation of CP-symmetry&amp;nbsp;– was discovered in 1964 (direct CP-violation, that is violation of CP-symmetry in a decay process, was discovered later, in 1999). Due to CPT symmetry, violation of CP-symmetry demands violation of time inversion symmetry, or [[T-symmetry]].

In the out-of-equilibrium decay scenario,&lt;ref name=Riotto99&gt;

|arxiv = hep-ph/9901362 |bibcode = 1999ARNPS..49...35R }}&lt;/ref&gt; the last condition states that the rate of a reaction which generates baryon-asymmetry must be less than the rate of expansion of the universe. In this situation the particles and their corresponding antiparticles do not achieve thermal equilibrium due to rapid expansion decreasing the occurrence of pair-annihilation.

== Baryogenesis within the Standard Model (Electroweak Baryogenesis) ==
The [[Standard Model]] can incorporate baryogenesis, though the amount of net baryons (and leptons) thus created may not be sufficient to account for the present baryon asymmetry. This issue has not yet been determined decisively.

Baryogenesis within the Standard Model requires the [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak]] [[Higgs mechanism|symmetry breaking]] be a [[Phase transition#Ehrenfest classification|first-order]] [[phase transition]], since otherwise [[sphaleron]]s wipe off any baryon asymmetry that happened up to the phase transition, while later the amount of baryon non-conserving interactions is negligible.&lt;ref name=KRS1985&gt;

The [[phase transition]] [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain wall]] breaks the [[P-symmetry]] spontaneously, allowing for [[CP-symmetry]] violating interactions to create [[C-symmetry|C-asymmetry]] on both its sides: quarks tend to accumulate on the broken phase side of the domain wall, while anti-quarks tend to accumulate on its unbroken phase side. This happens as follows:&lt;ref name="FarrarShaposhnikov1993"/&gt;

Due to [[CP-symmetry]] violating [[electroweak]] interactions, some amplitudes involving quarks are not equal to the corresponding amplitudes involving anti-quarks, but rather have opposite phase (see [[CKM matrix]] and [[Kaon]]); since [[T-symmetry|time reversal]] takes an amplitude to its complex conjugate, [[CPT-symmetry]] is conserved.

Though some of their amplitudes have opposite phases, both quarks and anti-quarks have positive energy, and hence acquire the same phase as they move in space-time. This phase also depends on their mass, which is identical but depends both on [[flavor]] and on the [[Higgs field|Higgs]] [[Vacuum expectation value|VEV]] which changes along the domain wall. Thus certain sums of amplitudes for quarks have different absolute values compared to those of anti-quarks. In all, quarks and anti-quarks may have different reflection and transmission probabilities through the domain wall, and it turns out that more quarks coming from the unbroken phase are transmitted compared to anti-quarks.

Thus there is a net baryonic flux through the domain wall. Due to [[sphaleron]] transitions, which are abundant in the unbroken phase, the net anti-baryonic content of the unbroken phase is wiped off. However, sphalerons are rare enough in the broken phase as not to wipe off the excess of baryons there. In total, there is net creation of baryons.

In this scenario, non-perturbative electroweak interactions (i.e. the [[sphaleron]]) are responsible for the B-violation, the perturbative electroweak Lagrangian is responsible for the CP-violation, and the domain wall is responsible for the lack of thermal equilibrium; together with the CP-violation it also creates a C-violation in each of its sides.

== Matter content in the universe ==
{{see also|Baryon asymmetry}}

=== Baryon asymmetry parameter ===
The challenges to the physics theories are then to explain ''how'' to produce this preference of matter over antimatter, and also the ''magnitude'' of this asymmetry. An important quantifier is the ''asymmetry parameter'',
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{n_B - n_{\bar B}}{n_\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.
This quantity relates the overall number density difference between baryons and antibaryons (n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;{{overline|B}}&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively) and the number density of [[cosmic background radiation]] [[photon]]s n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;.

According to the Big Bang model, matter decoupled from the [[cosmic background radiation]] (CBR) at a temperature of roughly {{val|3000}} [[kelvin]], corresponding to an average kinetic energy of {{val|3000|u=K}} / ({{val|10.08|e=3|u=K/eV}}) = {{val|0.3|u=eV}}. After the decoupling, the ''total'' number of CBR photons remains constant. Therefore, due to space-time expansion, the photon density decreases. The photon density at equilibrium temperature T per cubic centimeter, is given by
:&lt;math&gt;n_\gamma = \frac{1}{\pi^2} {\left(\frac{k_B T}{\hbar c}\right)}^3 \int_0^\infty \frac{x^2}{e^x - 1} dx =
  \frac{2\zeta(3)}{\pi^2}{\left(\frac{k_B T}{\hbar c}\right)}^3 \approx
  20.3 \left(\frac{T}{1\text{K}}\right)^3 \text{cm}^{-3}
&lt;/math&gt;,
with k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; as the [[Boltzmann constant]], ħ as the [[Planck constant]] divided by 2π and c as the speed of light in vacuum, and ζ(3) as
[[Apéry's constant]]. At the current CBR photon temperature of {{val|2.725|u=K}}, this corresponds to a photon density n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; of around 411 CBR photons per cubic centimeter.

Therefore, the asymmetry parameter η, as defined above, is ''not'' the "good" parameter. Instead, the preferred asymmetry parameter uses the [[entropy]] density s,
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_s = \frac{n_B - n_{\bar B}}{s}&lt;/math&gt;
because the entropy density of the universe remained reasonably constant throughout most of its evolution. The entropy density is
:&lt;math&gt;s \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\mathrm{entropy}}{\mathrm{volume}} = \frac{p + \rho}{T} = \frac{2\pi^2}{45}g_{*}(T) T^3&lt;/math&gt;
with p and ρ as the pressure and density from the energy density tensor T&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;, and g&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; as the effective number of degrees of freedom for "massless" particles (inasmuch as mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≪ k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T holds) at temperature T,
:&lt;math&gt;g_*(T) = \sum_\mathrm{i=bosons} g_i{\left(\frac{T_i}{T}\right)}^3 + \frac{7}{8}\sum_\mathrm{j=fermions} g_j{\left(\frac{T_j}{T}\right)}^3&lt;/math&gt;,
for bosons and fermions with g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and g&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; degrees of freedom at temperatures T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; respectively. At the present era, s = {{val|7.04|s=n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

'''Bergen International Festival''' ({{lang-no|Festspillene i Bergen}}) is an annual international music and cultural festival in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|publisher = Kunnskapsforlaget| title = Festspillene i Bergen| encyclopedia = Store norske leksikon| location = Oslo| accessdate = 2009-05-29| url = http://www.snl.no%7cFestspillene_i_Bergen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
The festival is the largest in the Nordic countries in its genre and has a large number of activities in music, dance, literature, visual arts, folklore, etc. The festival is held over fourteen days from the end of May to the start of June and is located in numerous places like the [[Grieg Hall]], [[Haakon's Hall]], [[Troldhaugen]], [[Lysøen]], [[Siljustøl]] as well as streets and town squares of Bergen. In the same time span the International Jazz Festival, [[Nattjazz]], takes place in [[Bergen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/kultur/festspill-og-nattjazz-svinger-1.7141106 |title=Festspill og Nattjazz svinger sammen |language=Norwegian |last=Wicklund |first=Erling |authorlink=Erling Wicklund |publisher=[[NRK]] |date=2010-05-27 |accessdate=2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marvin Gaye]] was an [[United States|American]] [[musician]] who gained worldwide fame for his work with [[Motown Records]]. He was fatally shot by his father, [[Marvin Gay Sr.]], on April 1, 1984, at their house in the [[West Adams, Los Angeles, California|West Adams]] district of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodusa.co.uk/deathsites/marvingayehouse.htm |title=Marvin Gaye House |accessdate=June 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="murderplace"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|title=Dial Them For Murder|work=Los Angeles Magazine|date=January 1998|author1=Communications|first1=Emmis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaye was shot twice following an altercation with his father after he intervened in an argument between his parents. The wounds were fatal and he was pronounced [[dead on arrival]] at the [[California Hospital Medical Center]]. Gaye's death inspired several musical tributes over the years including recollections of the incidents leading to his death. Gaye was given a burial plot at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Cemetery]] and was later [[cremation|cremated]] and his ashes spread around the Pacific Ocean.

==Circumstances==
[[Image:Marvindancing.jpg|right|thumb|Marvin Gaye performing in concert during the 1980s.]]
[[Marvin Gaye]] had an [[acrimonious]] relationship with his father, [[Marvin Gay Sr.]], since his childhood. Marvin Sr. was a [[Christianity|Christian]] minister who was a strict disciplinarian and often physically punished his children. He was also a [[crossdresser]], which was commonly known in the family's [[Washington, D.C.]] neighborhood and made the younger Marvin a target of bullying. It was because of this, added with rumors of Marvin's own [[homosexuality]], that Marvin added an "e" to his last name when he became famous. Gaye's father never approved of his son's career in music, and gradually grew resentful that Gaye was closer to his mother, Alberta, and had become the breadwinner for the family. Despite a brief improvement in their relationship after Gaye found success with his album ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'', father and son never found any lasting peace.

By 1983, after a period as a European [[tax exile]], Gaye had re-emerged in the public eye with the hit song, "[[Sexual Healing]]" and its album, ''[[Midnight Love]]''. For a time, he had also achieved [[sobriety]] during his extensive stay in [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="American"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanwaymag.com/marvin-gaye-ostend-freddy-cousaert-david-ritz|title=Marvin Gaye – American Way Magazine|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the United States, he embarked on his final ''Sexual Healing Tour'' in April of that year.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp=318–320}} Gaye, who had a profound dislike for touring, returned to [[cocaine]] [[substance dependence|abuse]] to cope with the pressures of the road, and midway through the tour he developed [[paranoia]] over an alleged attempt on his life, wearing a [[bulletproof vest]] until he was on stage. In reality, there was little, if any, real danger, although while on the tour, road crew member Eric Sharpe committed suicide by hanging himself from a shower curtain rod in [[New Jersey]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp=320–325}}

When the tour ended in August 1983, Gaye returned to the U.S. to nurse his mother, who was recovering from kidney surgery,&lt;ref name="American"/&gt;{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp=310–315}} and moved into his parents's residence at 2101 South Gramercy Place, a home which he bought for them in 1973.&lt;ref name="murderplace" /&gt;{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=325}}  During his stay, Gaye's father was absent.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=321-322}} That October, his father returned from a business trip in Washington during which he purchased insurance on his family's previous residence.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=326}} Initially, Gaye's sisters Jeanne and Zeola lived in the house before Marvin Sr. returned to the property, and left shortly afterwards due to the growing conflict between father and son.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp=322–325}} For the next six months, the two men struggled to keep their distance from one another. During one quarrel at the house, the elder Gay&lt;!-- NOT A TYPO -- his father's last name was Gay, not Gaye --&gt; called police to have his son leave the property.&lt;ref name=People&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.com/archive/marvin-gaye-was-a-prince-of-soul-but-one-who-knew-the-torment-of-drugs-and-violence-vol-21-no-15/ | title=Marvin Gaye Was a Prince of Soul, but One Who Knew the Torment of Drugs and Violence |date=April 16, 1985 |author=Eric Levin |work= [[People (magazine)|People]] |accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After staying with one of his sisters, however, Marvin returned to the property stating to a friend of his, "After all, I have just one father. I want to make peace with him."&lt;ref name=People/&gt; Jeanne Gaye later told David Ritz that her father had told her if Marvin ever touched him, he'd "kill him".{{sfn|Ebony|1985|p=108}}{{sfn|Jet|1985|p=18}}

On [[December 25|Christmas Day]], 1983, Marvin gave his father a [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] [[.38 special]] pistol so that he could protect himself from intruders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/marvin_gaye/13.html |title=The Domestic Dispute that ended the life of Marvin Gaye |work=trutv.com |accessdate=June 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends and family members contended that the younger Marvin was often suicidal and paranoid, and by now was afraid of leaving his room and spoke of little besides suicide and [[death]]. He sometimes wore three overcoats and put his shoes on the wrong feet.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=332}} Four days before his death, according to his sister Jeanne, Gaye had tried to kill himself by jumping out of a speeding sports car, suffering only minor bruises.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp=331–332}} Jeanne contended that "there was no doubt Marvin wanted to die" and that he "couldn't take any more."{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp=329–332}}

==Killing==
[[Image:Marvinsdad.jpg|left|thumb|[[Marvin Gay Sr.]] at his sentencing hearing following the shooting of his son, September 1984.]]
In the days prior to his death, Gaye's parents had arguments mainly over a misplaced [[insurance policy]] letter.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp=331–332}} The day before his death, the arguments spread to Gaye's bedroom. Angered by his father confronting his mother, Gaye commanded Marvin Sr. to leave her alone; Marvin Sr. complied without incident and there was no violence that night, but continued yelling throughout the house.

At approximately 12:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. ([[Pacific Time Zone|PST]]; 20:30 UTC)&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/02/us/marvin-gaye-is-shot-and-killed-pop-singer-s-father-faces-charge.html |title=Marvin Gaye Is Shot And Killed; Pop Singer's Father Faces Charge |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 1, 1984 |accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on April 1, 1984, an impatient Marvin Sr. shouted at his wife about the document.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=332}} Gaye, dressed in a maroon robe, shouted back downstairs, telling his father if he had something to say, he'd better do it in person.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=333}} According to Alberta, when Marvin Sr. refused his son's request, Gaye warned him not to come to his room.&lt;ref name="FinalDeath"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findadeath.com/Deceased/g/Marvin%20Gaye/marvin_gaye.htm |title=The Death of Marvin Gaye |accessdate=June 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvin Sr., however, instead charged upstairs to the bedroom to verbally attack Alberta over the document, causing Gaye to jump out of his bed and once again order his father out of the room.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=333}} When ordering did not work, Gaye, enraged and despondent, reportedly shoved his father out of the room into the hallway{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=333}} and subjected him to some severe physical violence, notably kicking and punching.
Alberta later told Ritz: "Marvin hit him. I shouted for him to stop, but he paid no attention to me. He gave my husband some hard kicks."{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=333}} Jeanne later recalled that it was understood in the family that if one of the children ever dared to strike their father that he would "murder him or her", saying her father "made it very clear" and "said so publicly on more than one occasion."{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=333}} Gaye reportedly followed his father to the bedroom and, according to his mother, kicked him brutally.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=333}}&lt;ref name="FinalDeath"/&gt;{{sfn|Baltimore Afro-American|1984}} Eventually, Alberta separated Gaye from his father and returned him to his bedroom.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=333}}&lt;ref name="FinalDeath"/&gt;

Minutes later, at 12:38&amp;nbsp;p.m. ([[Pacific Time Zone|PST]]; 20:38 UTC), Marvin Sr. entered his bedroom, returning with the .38 pistol his son had bought him, pointed the gun at Gaye and shot him directly in the heart, as Alberta later explained to police:

{{quote|I was standing about eight feet away from Marvin, when my husband came to the door of the bedroom with his pistol. My husband didn't say anything, he just pointed the gun at Marvin.  I screamed but it was very quick.  He, my husband, shot – and Marvin screamed.  I tried to run.  Marvin slid down to the floor after the first shot.&lt;ref name="FinalDeath"/&gt;{{sfn|Baltimore Afro-American|1984}}}}

The first shot, which proved to be fatal, entered the right side of Gaye's chest, perforating his right lung, heart, diaphragm, liver, stomach and left kidney before coming to rest against his left flank.&lt;ref name="FinalDeath"/&gt; Gaye's father stepped closer after the first shot and shot him a second time at [[point-blank range]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=333}}&lt;ref name="FinalDeath"/&gt; In a 2018 episode of the [[Reelz]] TV series ''[[Autopsy: The Last Hours of...]]'', forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Hunter expressed his belief that Gaye was initially shot nonfatally in the left shoulder by his father while the two men were standing two feet apart while facing each other.&lt;ref name="autopsy hunter"&gt;"Autopsy: The Last Hours of Marvin Gaye."  ''Autopsy: The Last Hours of...''.  Nar. Eric Meyers.  Exec. Prod. Ed Taylor, Clare Hollywood, and Michael Kelpie.  Reelz, 25 Feb. 2018.  Television.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Hunter believed that this first shot "penetrated the left shoulder just below the clavicle and exited his back without causing any serious injury", the impact of which caused Gaye to fall down.&lt;ref name="autopsy hunter"/&gt; Hunter also believed that Gaye was then shot fatally in the chest, which "had a very damaging and odd trajectory," traveling "diagonally down through the lung, heart, diaphragm, liver, and kidney, finally embedding itself on the left side of the torso."&lt;ref name="autopsy hunter"/&gt; From Hunter's point of view, "the direction of the bullet's trajectory suggests Marvin was positioned toward his father, and that his father was likely to have been moving away at the time."&lt;ref name="autopsy hunter"/&gt;

Afraid of being shot next, Alberta screamed and ran out of the bedroom, all the while pleading in fear to her husband not to shoot her.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=333}} According to reports, Gaye's father hid the gun underneath his pillow. In the meantime, Gaye's brother [[Frankie Gaye|Frankie]] and his sister-in-law, Irene, heard the shots as they lived in a guest house on the property. After the first shot, Frankie initially thought it sounded like a car backfired.{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=2}} Afterwards, they heard screams from outside, rushed out, and saw Alberta who ran into Irene's arms, shouting, "He's shot Marvin. He's killed my boy."{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=3}}

Frankie ran to the house and carefully walked into the hallway to his brother's room, not knowing if Marvin Sr. still had the gun, whether he was still in the room, or if his brother was dead. After walking into Gaye's bedroom, an emotional Frankie held him as Gaye bled rapidly. According to Frankie, Gaye, barely speaking above a whisper, told him, "I got what I wanted... I couldn't do it myself, so I had him do it... it's good, I ran my race, there's no more left in me."{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=189-191}} After police arrived, Irene went to Marvin Sr. in his bedroom and asked him where the gun was. After searching over his bedroom, Irene located it under his pillow. Upon exiting the house, Irene dropped the gun on the lawn. Immediately following this, Marvin Sr., who had by now taken a seat on the front porch outside the house, was arrested.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=334}}

The police arrived twenty minutes after the shooting. Gaye's body was taken out of the house and sent to the [[California Hospital Medical Center]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=334}} At approximately 1:01&amp;nbsp;p.m. ([[Pacific Time Zone|PST]]; 21:01 UTC), Gaye was pronounced [[dead on arrival]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=334}} Gaye died on the day before his 45th birthday.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=334}} As soon as his death was announced, several of Gaye's neighbors and onlookers paraded around the house, many in stunned shock and silence.

===Autopsy and funeral===

[[Image:Grammercy.JPG|right|thumb|People gathering outside Marvin Gaye's house following news the singer was fatally shot, April 1, 1984.]]
An [[autopsy]] was conducted on Gaye's body shortly after his death. Test results showed that he had elements of cocaine and [[phencyclidine|PCP]] (or angel dust) in his system.&lt;ref name="lifeanddeathconclusion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/marvin_gaye/14b.html|title=The Life and Death of Marvin Gaye: Conclusion|work=TruTv.com|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After lawyers misread the coroner's report, Judge [[Ronald M. George|Ronald George]] determined later during preliminary hearings in the court case that PCP can often invoke violence.  When told that the report had concluded only that Gaye had just cocaine traces in his system, the judge said PCP was not a major factor in his decision.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=337}}

During an interview with the police, Gaye's father contended that he was scared that something would happen to him and that he only meant to shoot in [[self-defense]], stating he did not know the gun had any bullets in it, claiming he thought there were either "blanks or BBs."{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=337}}{{sfn|Baltimore Afro-American|1984}} When asked if he loved his son, Marvin Sr. reportedly stated in a soft voice, "Let's say I didn't dislike him."{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=337}} Upon being told that his son had died from the shots, Marvin Sr. reportedly wept and sobbed after realizing he had killed him.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=337}} Marvin Sr. was held on bond afterwards. It's believed by Gaye's siblings that his death was a "premeditated [[suicide]]". Jeanne later said that upon forcing his father's hand in the murder that he had "accomplished three things. He put himself out of his misery. He brought relief to Mother by finally getting her husband out of her life. And he punished Father, by making certain that the rest of his life would be miserable... my brother knew just what he was doing."{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=337}}

On April 5, 1984, Gaye was given a star-studded funeral at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale]], attended by over 10,000 mourners, including his Motown colleagues; his two ex-wives, Anna Gaye and Janis Gaye; and his siblings, mother and three children.&lt;ref name="FinalDeath"/&gt;{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp=335–336}} [[Smokey Robinson]] and [[Dick Gregory]] delivered eulogies, while [[Stevie Wonder]] performed "Lighting Up the Candles," which was later placed on Wonder's soundtrack to the film ''[[Jungle Fever (soundtrack)|Jungle Fever]]'', and Cecil T. "Sesil J" Jenkins sang "[[The Lord's Prayer]]".{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp=239–253}} At the open-casket funeral, Gaye was wearing one of his costumes from his final concert tour, a gold and white military style uniform, with an ermine wrap at his shoulders.&lt;ref name="FinalDeath" /&gt;{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp = 335–336}} The funeral was presided by the Chief Apostle of Gaye's family's old church, the House of God.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp = 335–336}} Following the funeral, Gaye was given a [[burial plot]]. In accordance with the family's request, Gaye's body was [[cremation|cremated]] with half of his ashes spread near the Pacific Ocean by his three children and Anna Gaye.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|pp = 335–336}}{{sfn|Gray|2010|pp = 173–174}}{{sfn|Jet|1985|pp = 12–16}} Anna and their adopted son, Marvin III, then kept a small sample of the ashes for themselves.{{sfn|Gray|2010|pp = 173–174}}

Gaye left behind no [[will (law)|will]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p = ix}} As a result, his son Marvin III, aged 17 at the time, became co-administrator of his estate.{{sfn|Jet|1984b|p=57}} At the time of his death, he was struggling financially, as the [[IRS]] had asked for $1 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1984}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) to pay back unpaid taxes of $600,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|600000|1984}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) to the [[State of California]] and back [[alimony]] of $300,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|300000|1984}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) to Anna and Janis Gaye.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=335}} He was $1,900,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1900000|1984}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in debt at the time of his death, but royalties from Gaye's work eventually paid off those debts.

===Court case===
Marvin Sr. was held at the [[Los Angeles County Jail]] on a $100,000 bail (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1984}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=337}} His accounts of the shooting were printed in the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]'', quoting his words: "I didn't mean to do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/08/us/around-the-nation-marvin-gaye-s-father-tells-of-fatal-shooting.html?scp=5&amp;sq=death%20of%20marvin%20gaye&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=AROUND THE NATION; Marvin Gaye's Father Tells of Fatal Shooting | date=April 8, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a check up at the [[County-USC Medical Center]], a benign [[tumor]] was discovered at the base of Marvin Sr.'s brain. Doctors removed the tumor on May 17, 1984. On June 12, after reviewing a two-page report, including two [[psychiatric evaluation]]s conducted by Dr. Ronald Markman, Judge Michael Pirosh ruled that Marvin Sr. was competent to stand trial.{{sfn|''The Montreal Gazette''|1984|p=60}} He appeared in court again on June 20, where he was ordered to return on July 16 for a [[preliminary hearing]]. His estranged wife, Alberta, posted the reduced [[bail]] of $30,000 via a bondsman to secure the ex-minister's release from jail.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=338}} Two days earlier, she had filed for [[divorce]], citing she officially separated from him following their son's fatal shooting on the same day.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=338}}{{sfn|Kentucky New Era|1984}} Looking over documents, the amount of drugs in Gaye's system, and pictures of Marvin Sr.'s injuries during his final fight with his son, Judge [[Ronald M. George]] agreed to grant Marvin Sr. a [[plea bargain]]. As a result, he pleaded [[no contest]] to a [[voluntary manslaughter]] charge on September 20, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/21/us/around-the-nation-no-contest-plea-in-death-of-marvin-gaye.html?scp=1&amp;sq=death%20of%20marvin%20gaye&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=AROUND THE NATION; No-Contest Plea In Death of Marvin Gaye | date=September 21, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2, 1984, Judge Gordon Ringer sentenced Marvin Sr. to a six-year [[suspended sentence]] and five years [[probation]]. During the sentencing hearing, Marvin Sr. tearfully told the court:

{{quote|If I could bring him back, I would. I was afraid of him. I thought I was going to get hurt. I didn't know what was going to happen. I'm really sorry for everything that happened. I loved him. I wish he could step through this door right now. I'm paying the price now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/marvin_gaye/14b.html | title=The Life and Death of Marvin Gaye |accessdate=June 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Glatt|2011|p=239}}}}

==Aftermath==

===Reactions===
News stations reported on the death almost immediately after it was announced, with one of the most prominent announcements coming from [[CBS]] anchor [[Dan Rather]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=337}} Eulogies were delivered in [[The Americas|America]]n, Asian and European countries.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=337}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran the story in its front page the day after his death.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=337}}

Initial reactions to Gaye's death were shock on the part of many of his peers. [[Otis Williams]], of the Motown group [[The Temptations]], recalled receiving the news while touring with the [[Four Tops]] in [[Australia]] and said, "It was a very dark day that I will never forget as the day I lost a friend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal=Marvin Gaye: the Real Thing in Performance 1964–1981 |date=April 2006 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Motown staffer [[Janie Bradford]] and her husband were driving home after listening to radio all day when the announcer announced Gaye's death.&lt;ref name=celebritycrimestories&gt;''Celebrity Crime Stories: Marvin Gaye'', TV One, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Urban]] president Larkin Arnold was also reportedly stunned with the news as he had tried to get Gaye in the studio for his follow-up to ''Midnight Love''.&lt;ref name=celebritycrimestories/&gt; Smokey Robinson heard the news of Gaye's death on the radio. Feeling that his "inners wouldn't accept" the news, he called Gaye's ex-wife Anna to find out whether it was true, and she confirmed it before he could ask her, leaving Robinson in shock.&lt;ref name=whatsgoingon&gt;''American Masters: What's Going On – The Life and Death of Marvin Gaye'', [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ8DcDhyNXY |title=Marvin Gaye Last Day |publisher=[[YouTube]] |work=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longtime Gaye admirer and former nephew-in-law [[Jermaine Jackson]], brother of [[Michael Jackson]], recalled sobbing uncontrollably once he heard the news and called [[Barry White]] to confirm the story.&lt;ref name=behindthemusic&gt;''[[Behind the Music]]'', [[VH1]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt; According to White, Gaye had agreed to do a series of [[duet]]s with him.&lt;ref name=behindthemusic/&gt; [[Ray Singleton]], a former spouse of [[Berry Gordy]]'s, received the news from Anna on the phone.

===Memorials and tributes===
{{Main|List of tributes to Marvin Gaye}}
Gaye was placed on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' for the third time in a posthumous cover in its May 10, 1984 issue. The issue discussed Gaye's personal life, his music, and his contributions to Motown and popular music.

In November 1984, [[Diana Ross]] released the tribute song, "[[Missing You (Diana Ross song)|Missing You]]."  It appeared on Ross' album, ''[[Swept Away (Diana Ross album)|Swept Away]]'', and later peaked at #1 on the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Black Singles]] chart and placed at #10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].  Later, a video of the song featured classic footage of Gaye, including footage of Gaye appearing at Ross' 1982 concert in [[Brussels]]. The following January while hosting the [[American Music Awards]], Ross led an In Memoriam tribute to stars who died in 1984 with Gaye leading the tribute.  Also in November 1984, [[Teena Marie]] released the tribute song, "My Dear Mr. Gaye" from her hit album, ''Starchild'', the highest selling album of her career.  [[The Commodores]] issued the song [[Nightshift (song)|"Nightshift]]," which was dedicated to Gaye and fellow musician [[Jackie Wilson]], who also died in 1984. The song, featured on their album of the same name, peaked at #1 on the rhythm and blues chart, reached the top ten on the Hot 100, and became a hit in other countries. [[Todd Rundgren]]'s song "Lost Horizon" from his ''[[A Cappella (Todd Rundgren album)|A Cappella]]'' album is said to be dedicated to Gaye. Rundgren later performed a medley of Gaye's hits during concerts and sometimes added "Lost Horizon" to the medley. In 1989, soul band [[Maze (band)|Frankie Beverly &amp; Maze]] produced the tribute song, "Silky Soul," taking its melody from "[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]."  The song featured [[Nona Gaye]] in the video and later peaked at #5 on the R&amp;B chart. At least two [[tribute albums]] of Gaye's have been released: 1995's ''[[Inner City Blues: The Music of Marvin Gaye]]'' and 1999's ''[[Marvin Is 60: A Tribute Album]]''.

Starting in 1985, there have been annual Marvin Gaye Day celebrations in the city of [[Washington, D.C.]], Gaye's hometown. The day was officiated by then-mayor [[Marion Barry]] on the day of Gaye's 46th birthday.{{sfn|Jet|1985|p=56}} Since then, a non-profit organization has helped to organize Marvin Gaye Day celebrations in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvingayeday.com|title=Home Page|accessdate=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Marvin's mother Alberta founded the Marvin P.

Six years later, in 1996, Gaye posthumously received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. In 2006, an old park that Gaye frequented as a teenager, the former Watts Branch Park, was renamed [[Washington Parks and People|Marvin Gaye Park]] in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonparks.net/marvin_gaye_park|title=Washington Parks and People: Marvin Gaye Park|accessdate=December 7, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717045640/http://washingtonparks.net/marvin_gaye_park|archivedate=July 17, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, in 2009, the 5200 block of Foote Street NE in [[Deanwood]], Washington, D.C., was renamed Marvin Gaye Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonparks.net/marvin_gaye_park|title="Marvin Gaye Way" Coming to Deanwood – Housing Complex|date=April 1, 2009|accessdate=December 7, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717045640/http://washingtonparks.net/marvin_gaye_park|archivedate=July 17, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most pervasive violations of [[women's rights]] in [[Paraguay]] involve sexual and domestic abuse. On average one woman is murdered every 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipsnews.net/2010/03/paraguay-new-police-units-for-domestic-violence-victims/&lt;/ref&gt; Although Paraguay has taken several measures to deal with this problem, including creating special police units for domestic violence victims,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipsnews.net/2010/03/paraguay-new-police-units-for-domestic-violence-victims/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/co/CEDAW-C-PRY-CO-6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; lack of adequate laws, as well as conservative attitudes within a male dominated society hinder progress.

==Social background==
[[File:PRY orthographic.svg|thumb|200 px|Paraguay highlighted on the map]]
Paraguay is a landlocked country in [[South America]], bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest. The vast majority of its population identifies as [[Roman Catholic]], and [[religion in Paraguay]] plays a very important role. Paraguay is a [[socially conservative]] society;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/paraguay/local-laws-and-customs &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/Paraguay.html&lt;/ref&gt; and has been slow to change traditional views on family: [[divorce]] was legalized only in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;''Sex and the State: Abortion, Divorce, and the Family Under Latin. American Dictatorships and Democracies'', by Mala Htun, pp 102 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent of domestic violence==
It is very difficult to assess the extent of domestic violence. Most cases are not reported to authorities, and victims endure the violence privately. In a 2008 survey, 20.4% of the women interviewed in the survey (aged 15-49) said they suffered physical or sexual violence by a current or former partner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.paho.org/hq/dmdocuments/violence-against-women-lac.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This was lower than many other countries in the area, but these figures, being self-reported, may reflect differing personal understanding of what constitutes abuse. Of women who said they experienced domestic abuse in the past 12 months, 12.9% said they sought any institutional help for the abuse.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.paho.org/hq/dmdocuments/violence-against-women-lac.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, 770 instances of domestic violence against men by their partners were recorded (1,540 annualised).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ultimahora.com/suman-770-hombres-victimas-violencia-domestica-lo-que-va-del-ano-n1103777.html|title=Suman 770 hombres víctimas de violencia doméstica|access-date=2017-08-29|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legislative response==
The legal response of Paraguay to domestic violence has been very weak, even by Latin American standards. Although Paraguay enacted in 2000 ''Law No. 1,600 Against Domestic Violence'' (Ley No 1.600 contra la Violencia Doméstica), this law - while having a broad definition of domestic violence (including physical, psychological and sexual abuse "lesiones, maltratos físicos, psíquicos o sexuales" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/domesticviolence/paraguay.dv.00.htm&lt;/ref&gt;) - is civil in nature, and as such does not provide for any sanctions against the perpetrators. 

While the Criminal Code provides for a crime of domestic violence, this crime has a very narrow definition, as  physical violence that is carried out habitually, and is punishable by a fine only. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.refworld.org/docid/42df61652.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurasiareview.com/07072011-paraguay-makes-step-forward-for-women%E2%80%99s-and-indigenous-rights-analysis/&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, there have been increasing calls, from both inside and outside of the country, for the enactment of a comprehensive law against [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.decidamos.org.py/www/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1705:10-razones-por-las-que-paraguay-necesita-una-ley-integral-contra-la-violencia-hacia-las-mujeres&amp;Itemid=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pj.gov.py/contenido/136-secretaria-de-genero/609&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://noticias.lainformacion.com/politica/derechos-humanos/paraguay-requiere-ley-contra-violencia-de-genero-dice-representante-de-onu_StZtbOZvhADLnLJA5rcFN6/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoy.com.py/nacionales/a-paraguay-le-urge-una-ley-contra-violencia-de-genero&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paraguay.com/nacionales/reclaman-ley-integral-contra-la-violencia-hacia-las-mujeres-99037&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.com.py/especiales/fin-de-semana/un-salto-legal-contra-la-violencia-hacia-las-mujeres-1303660.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Folklorama''' is an event that runs for two weeks each August in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada. Visitors to the festival are invited to sample cuisine and celebrate the cultural and ethnic heritage of people from dozens of cultures who have made Winnipeg their home. Folklorama is the world's largest and longest-running multicultural festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Folklorama kicks off this weekend|url=http://www.globalwinnipeg.com/folklorama+kicks+off+this+weekend/6442691374/story.html|publisher=Global News|accessdate=6 August 2012|date=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each culture has an assigned venue, known as a pavilion. Typically there are over 40 pavilions presented throughout the city, with half operating in week one and half in week two of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What to Expect|url=http://www.folklorama.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=13|accessdate=1 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809164053/http://www.folklorama.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=13|archivedate=9 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each pavilion presents a show featuring the song and dance of their culture, along with trademark ethnic cuisine and a cultural display. Some pavilions also incorporate additional services such as [[henna]] tattoo application, and some have late night parties. Most pavilions provide imported cultural beverage.

Folklorama provides exposure to cultural groups and brings in thousands of tourists each year, adding to the city's economy. It is the largest and longest-running festival of its kind in the world (determined by the International Council of Organizations for Folklore Festivals and Folk Art, also known as CIOFF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cioff.org/events-festivals.cfm|title=Festivals|work=cioff.org|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Folk Arts Council of Winnipeg is the organizing body of Folklorama.

==History==
[[File:2012 Scottish Pavilion at Folklorama in Winnipeg.jpg|thumb|Performers at the 2012 Folklorama Scottish Pavilion]]
Folklorama was first held in August 1970. It was originally intended to be a one-time occurrence in celebration of Manitoba's [[centennial]]. It was deemed such a success that it became an annual event. The first festival was only a week long, featuring 21 different cultures; it drew approximately 75,000 separate pavilion visits.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;"History". Folklorama. http://www.folklorama.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=56. Accessed 14-07-2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival adopted its current two-week format in 1988, with half of the pavilions open in each week. As of 2016, only four of the original pavilions have been open every year. They are: German, Ukraine-Kyiv, Greek, and Scandinavian.

The Folklorama logo was designed by Andy Stout who won the provincial logo contest in 1980. The 4 figures in the logo represent people from the four corners of the globe, who are intertwined, with arms raised in celebration. The festival's mascot, the Folklorama Llama, was created in 1986.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Until 1990, pavilions would have a mayor and a queen.  The queen would be in the running for the Miss Folklorama pageant at the end of the Festival. The Miss Folklorama pageant was not a beauty pageant but a "contest of ethnic preservation and presentation". Since 1990, pavilions now feature two adult ambassadors and two youth ambassadors, neither of whom must be of a specific gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FOLKLORAMA|url=http://www.afro-caribbean.org/events/folklorama/|publisher=Afro-Caribbean Association of Manitoba|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program areas==
Throughout the year, Folklorama is sustained by three business divisions: Travel, Talent, and Teachings.

{{US Constitution article series}}

The '''Fourteenth Amendment''' ('''Amendment XIV''') to the [[United States Constitution]] was adopted on July 9, 1868, as one of the [[Reconstruction Amendments]]. Arguably one of the most consequential amendments to this day, the amendment addresses citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws and was proposed in response to issues related to [[Freedman#United States|former slaves]] following the [[American Civil War]]. The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by the states of the defeated [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress. The amendment, particularly its first section, is one of the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) regarding racial segregation, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973) regarding abortion, ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000) regarding the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' (2015) regarding same-sex marriage. The amendment limits the actions of all state and local officials, including those [[State actor|acting]] on behalf of such an official.

The amendment's first section includes several clauses: the [[Citizenship Clause]], [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]], [[Due Process Clause]], and [[Equal Protection Clause]]. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves could not be citizens of the United States. Since  the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'' (1873), the Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted to do very little.

The Due Process Clause prohibits state and local government officials from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without legislative authorization. This clause has also been used by the federal judiciary to make most of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applicable to the states]], as well as to recognize [[Substantive due process|substantive]] and [[Due process#Procedural due process|procedural]] requirements that state laws must satisfy.  The Equal Protection Clause requires each state to provide equal protection under the law to all people, including all non-citizens, within its [[jurisdiction]]. This clause has been the basis for many decisions rejecting irrational or unnecessary discrimination against people belonging to various groups.

The second, third, and fourth sections of the amendment are seldom litigated. However, the second section's reference to "rebellion, or other crime" has been invoked as a constitutional ground for [[felony disenfranchisement]]. The fourth section was held, in ''[[Gold Clause Cases|Perry v. United States]]'' (1935), to prohibit a current Congress from abrogating a contract of debt incurred by a prior Congress. The fifth section gives Congress the power to enforce the amendment's provisions by "appropriate legislation"; however, under ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' (1997), this power may not be used to contradict a Supreme Court decision interpreting the amendment.

{{quote|'''Section 1.''' All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

{{anchor|Section 2}}'''Section 2.''' Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.

'''Section 3.''' No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.

'''Section 4.''' The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.

==Adoption==
===Proposal by Congress===
In the final years of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]] that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the 1865 [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-dominated [[Southern United States|Southern States]]. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], the [[Southern United States|Southern States]] would dramatically increase their power in the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}&lt;ref name="Stromberg111"&gt;Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Republicans began looking for a way to offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine|last=Nelson|first=William E.|year=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674041424|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VMCXjRyyKTQC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;q=thirteenth%20amendment%20%22three%20fifths%22|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, Congress passed what would become the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and preventing them from suing or testifying in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=Reconstruction|pages=199–200|isbn=978-0-8071-2234-1|date=1997-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and against whites.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=250–251}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=978-0-7006-0190-5|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=978-0-7006-0190-5|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Jeffrey. ''The Supreme Court: The Personalities and Rivalries That Defined America'', p. 79 (MacMillan 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Roger. ''The Constitution and its Amendments'', Vol. 4, p. 8 (Macmillan 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The experience also encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|pp=22–23}}
[[File:14th Amendment Senate &amp; House votes June, 1866.jpg|thumb|left|Senate and House votes on the Fourteenth Amendment]]
Over 70 proposals for an amendment were drafted.&lt;ref&gt;Soifer, "Prohibition of Voluntary Peonage" (2012), p. 1614.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1865, the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Reconstruction|Joint Committee on Reconstruction]] proposed an amendment stating that any citizens barred from voting on the basis of race by a state would not be counted for purposes of representation of that state.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=252}} This amendment passed the House, but was blocked in the Senate by a coalition of [[Radical Republican]]s led by [[Charles Sumner]], who believed the proposal a "compromise with wrong", and Democrats opposed to black rights.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=253}} Consideration then turned to a proposed amendment by Representative [[John A. Bingham]] of Ohio, which would enable Congress to safeguard "equal protection of life, liberty, and property" of all citizens; this proposal failed to pass the House.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=253}} In April 1866, the Joint Committee forwarded a third proposal to Congress, a carefully negotiated compromise that combined elements of the first and second proposals as well as addressing the issues of Confederate debt and voting by ex-Confederates.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=253}} The House of Representatives passed ''House Resolution 127, 39th Congress'' several weeks later and sent to the Senate for action. The resolution was debated and several amendments to it were proposed. Amendments to Sections 2, 3, and 4 were adopted on June 8, 1866, and the modified resolution passed by a 33 to 11 vote (5 absent, not voting). The House agreed to the Senate amendments on June 13 by a 138–36 vote (10 not voting). A concurrent resolution requesting the President to transmit the proposal to the executives of the several states was passed by both houses of Congress on June 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constitution of the United States and Amendments Thereto|year=1961|publisher=Virginia Commission on Constitutional Government|page=44|editor=James J. Kilpatrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, Edward LL.D., (Clerk of the House of Representatives of the United States)  ''"A Handbook of Politics for 1868"'', Part I - Political Manual for 1866, VI - Votes on Proposed Constitutional Amendments. Washington City: Philp &amp; Solomons. 1868, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Radical Republicans]] were satisfied that they had secured civil rights for blacks, but were disappointed that the amendment would not also secure political rights for blacks; in particular, the right to vote.&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;Carter, Dan. ''When the War Was Over: The Failure of Self-Reconstruction in the South, 1865–1867'', pp. 242–243 (LSU Press 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Thaddeus Stevens]], a leader of the disappointed [[Radical Republicans]], said: "I find that we shall be obliged to be content with patching up the worst portions of the ancient edifice, and leaving it, in many of its parts, to be swept through by the tempests, the frosts, and the storms of despotism."&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Graber1502&gt;Graber, "Subtraction by Addition?" (2012), pp. 1501–1502.&lt;/ref&gt; Abolitionist [[Wendell Phillips]] called it a "fatal and total surrender".&lt;ref name=Graber1502 /&gt; This point would later be addressed by the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]].

[[File:Letter of Transmittal of 14th Amemdment to the Several States.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Form of the Letter of Transmittal of the Fourteenth Amendment to the several states for its ratification]]
On June 16, 1866, Secretary of State William Seward transmitted the Fourteenth Amendment to the governors of the several states for its ratification. State legislatures in every formerly Confederate state, with the exception of Tennessee, refused to ratify it. This refusal led to the passage of the [[Reconstruction Acts]]. Ignoring the existing state governments, military government was imposed until new civil governments were established and the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.&lt;ref name=america.gov&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/publication/2008/04/20080407120920eaifas0.4535639.html#axzz3whB8pdn2|title=The Civil War And Reconstruction|accessdate=January 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also prompted Congress to pass a law on March 2, 1867, requiring that a former Confederate state must ratify the Fourteenth Amendment before "said State shall be declared entitled to representation in Congress".&lt;ref&gt;An Act to provide for the more efficient Government of the Rebel States, enacted March 2, 1867, {{USStat|14|428}}, 429&lt;/ref&gt;

The first twenty-eight states to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment were:&lt;ref name=GPO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/HMAN-112/html/HMAN-112-pg99.htm|title=Amendment XIV|publisher=US Government Printing Office|accessdate=June 23, 2013|archivedate=June 23, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HabE9Mjd?url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/HMAN-112/html/HMAN-112-pg99.htm|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If rescission by Ohio and New Jersey were invalid, South Carolina would have been the 28th State. Rescission by Oregon did not occur until later. These rescissions caused significant controversy. However, ratification by other states continued during the course of the debate:
* [[Alabama]] – July 13, 1868

On July 20, 1868, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] certified that if withdrawals of ratification by New Jersey and Ohio were ineffective, then the amendment had become part of the Constitution on July 9, 1868, with ratification by South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Library of Congress|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875|page=707|url=https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=015/llsl015.db&amp;recNum=740}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Congress adopted and transmitted to the Department of State a concurrent resolution declaring the Fourteenth Amendment to be a part of the Constitution and directing the Secretary of State to [[Promulgation|promulgate]] it as such.&lt;ref name=Killian&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002|last=Killian|first=Johnny H.|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=9780160723797|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bJjxj5gLRaEC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;q=seward%20July%2028%2C%201868%20promulgate|display-authors=etal|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both New Jersey and Ohio were named in the congressional resolution as having ratified the amendment, although Alabama was also named, making 29 states total.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Library of Congress|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875|page=709|url=https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=015/llsl015.db&amp;recNum=742}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Library of Congress|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875|page=710|url=https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=015/llsl015.db&amp;recNum=743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, one more State ratified:
* [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] – July 21, 1868 (after rejection – November 9, 1866)

On July 27, Secretary Seward received the formal ratification from Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Library of Congress|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875|page=708|url=https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=015/llsl015.db&amp;recNum=741}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, July 28, Secretary Seward issued his official proclamation certifying the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Secretary Seward stated that his proclamation was "in conformance" to the resolution by Congress, but his official list of States included both Alabama and Georgia, as well as Ohio and New Jersey.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Library of Congress|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875|page=711|url=https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=015/llsl015.db&amp;recNum=744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inclusion of Ohio and New Jersey has led some to question the validity of rescission of a ratification. The inclusion of Alabama and Georgia has called that conclusion into question. While there have been Supreme Court cases dealing with ratification issues, this particular question has never been adjudicated.

The Fourteenth Amendment was subsequently ratified:&lt;ref name=GPO/&gt;
* [[Virginia]] – October 8, 1869 (after rejection – January 9, 1867)
* [[Mississippi]] – January 17, 1870
* [[Texas]] – February 18, 1870 (after rejection – October 27, 1866)
* [[Delaware]] – February 12, 1901 (after rejection – February 8, 1867)
* [[Maryland]] – April 4, 1959&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amendment of 1868 Ratified by Maryland|work=The New York Times|date=April 5, 1959|page=71|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/114922297/5479FE59A9FD42ACPQ/6?accountid=46320}}&lt;/ref&gt; (after rejection – March 23, 1867)
* [[California]] – May 6, 1959
* [[Kentucky]] – March 30, 1976 (after rejection – January 8, 1867)

Since Ohio and New Jersey re-ratified the Fourteenth Amendment in 2003, all U.S. states that existed during Reconstruction have ratified the amendment.

==Citizenship and civil rights==
{{double image|right|14th Amendment Pg1of2 AC.jpg|190|14th Amendment Pg2of2 AC.jpg|190|The two pages of the Fourteenth Amendment in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]}}

===Background===
Section 1 of the amendment formally defines United States citizenship and also protects various [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] from being abridged or denied by any state or [[state actor]]. Abridgment or denial of those civil rights by private persons is not addressed by this amendment; the Supreme Court held in the ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' (1883)&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; that the amendment was limited to "state action" and, therefore, did not authorize the Congress to outlaw [[Racism|racial discrimination]] by private individuals or organizations (though Congress can sometimes reach such discrimination via other parts of the Constitution). U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Joseph P. Bradley]] commented in the Civil Rights Cases that "individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject-matter of the [Fourteenth] Amendment. It has a deeper and broader scope. It nullifies and makes void all state legislation, and state action of every kind, which impairs the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, or which injures them in life, liberty or property without due process of law, or which denies to any of them the equal protection of the laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Civil Rights Cases'' (1883)|url=http://www.infoplease.com/us/supreme-court/cases/ar06.html|work=Pearson Education, Inc., publishing as Pearson Prentice Hall|publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate=October 23, 2013|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Radical Republicans]] who advanced the Thirteenth Amendment hoped to ensure broad civil and human rights for the newly freed people—but its scope was disputed before it even went into effect.&lt;ref&gt;Graber, "Subtraction by Addition?" (2012), p. 1523.&lt;/ref&gt; The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment wanted these principles enshrined in the Constitution to protect the new Civil Rights Act from being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and also to prevent a future Congress from altering it by a mere majority vote.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|pp=23–24}}&lt;ref name=Foner&gt;[[Eric Foner]], "The Second American Revolution", ''In These Times'', September 1987; reprinted in ''Civil Rights Since 1787'', ed. Jonathan Birnbaum &amp; Clarence Taylor, NYU Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0814782493}}&lt;/ref&gt; This section was also in response to violence against black people within the [[Southern United States|Southern States]]. The Joint Committee on Reconstruction found that only a Constitutional amendment could protect black people's rights and welfare within those states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.uakron.edu/dotAsset/727387.pdf|last=Finkelman|first=Paul|title=John Bingham and the Background to the Fourteenth Amendment|journal=Akron Law Review|year=2003|volume=36|issue=671|accessdate=April 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 1 has been the most frequently litigated part of the amendment,&lt;ref&gt;Harrell, David and Gaustad, Edwin. ''Unto A Good Land: A History Of The American People'', Volume 1, p. 520 (Eerdmans Publishing, 2005): "The most important, and the one that has occasioned the most litigation over time as to its meaning and application, was Section One."&lt;/ref&gt; and this amendment in turn has been the most frequently litigated part of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, D. ''The Waite Court: Justices, Rulings, and Legacy'', p. 147 (ABC-CLIO, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizenship Clause===
{{Main|Citizenship Clause}}
[[File:Jacob M. Howard - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|U.S. Senator from Michigan [[Jacob M. Howard]], author of the Citizenship Clause]]

The Citizenship Clause overruled the Supreme Court's [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' decision]] that [[black people]] were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1023809|title=Tsesis, Alexander, The Inalienable Core of Citizenship: From Dred Scott to the Rehnquist Court|journal=Arizona State Law Journal|volume=39|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[McDonald v. Chicago]]'', 130 S. Ct. 3020, 3060 (2010) ("This [clause] unambiguously overruled this Court's contrary holding in ''Dred Scott''.")&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about the constitutionality of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]],&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.is/20120712121855/http://laws.findlaw.com/us/392/409.html Jones v. Mayer]'', 392 U.S. 409 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; or to ensure that no subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uR8ZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=%22Chin-Yung+Yen%22+1905#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Chin-Yung%20Yen%22%201905 Yen, Chin-Yung].

There are varying interpretations of the original intent of Congress and of the ratifying states, based on statements made during the congressional debate over the amendment, as well as the customs and understandings prevalent at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, Emily. [http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thedebate/2006/03/born_in_the_usa.html "Born in the U.S.A.

Historian [[Eric Foner]], who has explored the question of [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|U.S. birthright citizenship]] to other countries, argues that:{{quote|Many things claimed as uniquely American—a devotion to individual freedom, for example, or social opportunity—exist in other countries. But birthright citizenship does make the United States (along with Canada) unique in the developed world. [...] Birthright citizenship is one expression of the commitment to equality and the expansion of national consciousness that marked [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. [...]  Birthright citizenship is one legacy of the titanic struggle of the Reconstruction era to create a genuine democracy grounded in the principle of equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foner|first1=Eric|title=Birthright Citizenship Is the Good Kind of American Exceptionalism|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/birthright-citizenship-is-the-good-kind-of-american-exceptionalism/|accessdate=November 12, 2015|work=The Nation|publisher=The Nation|date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Native Americans====
During the original congressional debate over the amendment Senator [[Jacob M. Howard]] of Michigan—the author of the Citizenship Clause&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;LaFantasie, Glenn (March 20, 2011) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/03/20/lafantasie_civil_war_consensus/index.html The erosion of the Civil War consensus], ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323115737/http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/03/20/lafantasie_civil_war_consensus/index.html |date=March 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—described the clause as having the same content, despite different wording, as the earlier Civil Rights Act of 1866, namely, that it excludes [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who maintain their tribal ties and "persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2893] Senator [[Reverdy Johnson]] said in the debate: "Now, all this amendment provides is, that all persons born in the United States and not subject to some foreign Power—for that, no doubt, is the meaning of the committee who have brought the matter before us—shall be considered as citizens of the United States...If there are to be citizens of the United States entitled everywhere to the character of citizens of the United States, there should be some certain definition of what citizenship is, what has created the character of citizen as between himself and the United States, and the amendment says citizenship may depend upon birth, and I know of no better way to give rise to citizenship than the fact of birth within the territory of the United States, born of parents who at the time were subject to the authority of the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Glenn W. LaFantasie of [[Western Kentucky University]], "A good number of his fellow senators supported his view of the citizenship clause."&lt;ref name=Salon/&gt; Others also agreed that the children of ambassadors and foreign ministers were to be excluded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2897].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=070/llcg070.db&amp;recNum=702 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 572].&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[James Rood Doolittle]] of Wisconsin asserted that all Native Americans were subject to United States jurisdiction, so that the phrase "Indians not taxed" would be preferable,&lt;ref&gt;[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2890,2892–4,2896].&lt;/ref&gt; but [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman]] [[Lyman Trumbull]] and Howard disputed this, arguing that the federal government did not have full jurisdiction over Native American tribes, which govern themselves and make treaties with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=14 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2893]. Trumbull, during the debate, said, "What do we [the committee reporting the clause] mean by 'subject to the jurisdiction of the United States'? Not owing allegiance to anybody else. That is what it means." He then proceeded to expound upon what he meant by "complete jurisdiction": "Can you sue a Navajoe Indian in court?...We make treaties with them, and therefore they are not subject to our jurisdiction.... If we want to control the Navajoes or any other Indians of which the Senator from Wisconsin has spoken, how do we do it? Do we pass a law to control them? Are they subject to our jurisdiction in that sense?.... Would he [Sen. Doolittle] think of punishing them for instituting among themselves their own tribal regulations? Does the Government of the United States pretend to take jurisdiction of murders and robberies and other crimes committed by one Indian upon another?... It is only those persons who come completely within our jurisdiction, who are subject to our laws, that we think of making citizens."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=howard2&gt;[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=16 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2895]. Howard additionally stated the word jurisdiction meant "the same jurisdiction in extent and quality as applies to every citizen of the United States now" and that the U.S. possessed a "full and complete jurisdiction" over the person described in the amendment.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'' (1884),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'', {{ussc|112|94|1884}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the clause's meaning was tested regarding whether birth in the United States automatically extended national citizenship. The Supreme Court held that Native Americans who voluntarily quit their tribes did not automatically gain national citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Urofsky|first=Melvin I.|author2=Finkelman, Paul|title=A March of Liberty: A Constitutional History of the United States|edition=2nd|publisher=Oxford University Press|place=New York, NY|year=2002|volume=1|isbn=978-0-19-512635-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LQVDZ9jg8m0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was resolved with the passage of the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]], which granted full U.S. citizenship to indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-335070700.html|title=Multilayered loyalties: Oregon Indian women as citizens of the land, their tribal nations, and the united States|author=Reid, Kay|date=September 22, 2012|journal=Oregon Historical Quarterly|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Children born to foreign nationals====
The Fourteenth Amendment provides that children born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction become American citizens at birth. At the time of the amendment's passage, President [[Andrew Johnson]] and three Senators, including Trumbull, the author of the Civil Rights Act, asserted that both the Civil Rights Act&lt;ref name=SenatePresidentJohnson&gt;[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=14 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 2893]. From the debate on the Civil Rights Act:&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Johnson: "...Who is a citizen of the United States is an open question. The decision of the courts and doctrine of the commentators is, that every man who is a citizen of the State becomes ipso facto a citizen of the United States; but there is no definition as to how citizenship can exist in the United States except through the medium of a citizenship in a State..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trumbullcowanexchange&gt;[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=070/llcg070.db&amp;recNum=603 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 498]. The debate on the Civil Rights Act contained the following exchange:&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Cowan: "I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?"&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Trumbull: "Undoubtedly."&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Trumbull: "I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German parents are not citizens."&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Cowan: "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Trumbull: "If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European."&lt;/ref&gt; and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship to children born to [[foreign national]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2891–2] During the debate on the Amendment, Senator [[John Conness]] of California declared, "The proposition before us, I will say, Mr. President, relates simply in that respect to the children begotten of Chinese parents in California, and it is proposed to declare that they shall be citizens. We have declared that by law [the Civil Rights Act]; now it is proposed to incorporate that same provision in the fundamental instrument of the nation. I am in favor of doing so. I voted for the proposition to declare that the children of all parentage, whatever, born in California, should be regarded and treated as citizens of the United States, entitled to equal Civil Rights with other citizens.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1944|title=Veto of the Civil Rights Bill – Teaching American History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Edgar Cowan]] of Pennsylvania had a decidedly different opinion.&lt;ref name=trumbullcowan&gt;[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=12 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 2891]. From the debate on the Civil Rights Act:&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Cowan: "...Therefore I think, before we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to be citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being much less dangerous and much less pestiferous to a society than I look upon Gypsies. I do not know how many my honorable friend from California looks upon Chinese, but I do know how some of his fellow citizens regard them. I have no doubt that now they are useful, and I have no doubt that within proper restraints, allowing that State and the other Pacific States to manage them as they may see fit, they may be useful; but I would not tie their hands by the Constitution of the United States so as to prevent them hereafter from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit..."&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause should apply to the children of [[Illegal immigration|unauthorized immigrants]] today, as "the problem ... did not exist at the time".&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Lee, Margaret. "[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33079.pdf Birthright Citizenship Under the 14th Amendment of Persons Born in the United States to Alien Parents]", [[Congressional Research Service]] (August 12, 2010): "Over the last decade or so, concern about illegal immigration has sporadically led to a re-examination of a long-established tenet of U.S. citizenship, codified in the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and §301(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. §1401(a)), that a person who is born in the United States, subject to its jurisdiction, is a citizen of the United States regardless of the race, ethnicity, or alienage of the parents. ... "some scholars argue that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment should not apply to the children of unauthorized aliens because the problem of unauthorized aliens did not exist at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was considered in Congress and ratified by the states."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, Congress has occasionally discussed passing a statute or a constitutional amendment to reduce the practice of "[[birth tourism]]", in which a foreign national gives birth in the United States to gain the child's citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0810/14th-Amendment-why-birthright-citizenship-change-can-t-be-done|title=14th Amendment: why birthright citizenship change 'can't be done'|author=Peter Grier|date=August 10, 2010|journal=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=June 12, 2013|archivedate=June 13, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HKkZWGn2?url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0810/14th-Amendment-why-birthright-citizenship-change-can-t-be-done}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clause's meaning with regard to a child of immigrants was tested in ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'' (1898).&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'', {{ussc|169|649|1898}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, a man born within the United States to Chinese citizens who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States and are carrying out business in the United States—and whose parents were not employed in a diplomatic or other official capacity by a foreign power—was a citizen of the United States. Subsequent decisions have applied the principle to the children of foreign nationals of non-Chinese descent.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez2009&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Second Founding: The Citizenship Clause, Original Meaning, and the Egalitarian Unity of the Fourteenth Amendment [PDF]|url=http://www.pennjcl.com/issues/11/11.5/11-5%20Rodriguez.pdf|year=2009|author=Rodriguez, C.M.|journal=U.

====Loss of citizenship====
[[Loss of citizenship|Loss of national citizenship]] is possible only under the following circumstances:
* Fraud in the [[naturalization]] process. Technically, this is not a loss of citizenship but rather a voiding of the purported naturalization and a declaration that the immigrant ''never was'' a citizen of the United States.&lt;ref name="StatePolicies"&gt;Current policies are at [https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual/HTML/PolicyManual-Volume12-PartL-Chapter2.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Affiliation with "anti-American" organizations (e.g., the Communist party, terrorist organizations, etc.) within 5 years of naturalization.  The State Department views such affiliations as sufficient evidence that an applicant must have lied or concealed evidence in the naturalization process.&lt;ref name="StatePolicies" /&gt;
* Other-than-honorable discharge from the U.S. armed forces before 5 years of honorable service, if honorable service was the basis for the naturalization.&lt;ref name="StatePolicies" /&gt;
* Voluntary relinquishment of citizenship. This may be accomplished either through renunciation procedures specially established by the State Department or through other actions that demonstrate desire to give up national citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_778.html |title=Advice about Possible Loss of U.S. Citizenship and Dual Nationality |last=U.S. Department of State |date=February 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416013437/http://www.travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_778.html |archivedate=April 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of the country's history, voluntary acquisition or exercise of a foreign citizenship was considered sufficient cause for revocation of national citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see ''[[Perez v. Brownell]]'', {{ussc|356|44|1958}}, overruled by ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'', {{ussc|387|253|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was enshrined in a series of treaties between the United States and other countries (the [[Bancroft Treaties]]). However, the Supreme Court repudiated this concept in ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'' (1967),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'', {{ussc|387|253|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''[[Vance v. Terrazas]]'' (1980),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vance v. Terrazas]]'', {{ussc|444|252|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; holding that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment barred the Congress from revoking citizenship. However, Congress can revoke citizenship that it had previously granted to a person not born in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Yoo, John.

===Privileges or Immunities Clause===
{{Main|Privileges or Immunities Clause}}
The Privileges or Immunities Clause, which protects the privileges and immunities of national citizenship from interference by the states, was patterned after the [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]] of Article IV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Raoul|title=Government by Judiciary : The Transformation of the Fourteenth Amendment|year=1997|publisher=Liberty Fund|location=Indianapolis|isbn=978-0865971448|page=58|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=675|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; which protects the privileges and immunities of state citizenship from interference by other states.&lt;ref name="Slaughter"&gt;''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'', {{ussc|83|36|1873}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'' (1873),&lt;ref name="Slaughter" /&gt; the Supreme Court concluded that the Constitution recognized two separate types of citizenship—"national citizenship" and "state citizenship"—and the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause prohibits states from interfering only with privileges and immunities possessed by virtue of national citizenship.&lt;ref name="Slaughter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beatty"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beatty |first=Jack |title=Age of Betrayal: The Triumph of Money in America, 1865–1900 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U3eG_QoBRzsC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;q=%22To%20Miller%20the%20first%20sentence%20of%20the%20Fourteenth%22 |accessdate=July 19, 2013 |date=April 8, 2008 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1400032426 |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court concluded that the privileges and immunities of national citizenship included only those rights that "owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws."&lt;ref name="Slaughter" /&gt; The Court recognized few such rights, including access to seaports and navigable waterways, the right to run for federal office, the protection of the federal government while on the high seas or in the jurisdiction of a foreign country, the right to travel to the seat of government, the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and the right to participate in the government's administration.&lt;ref name="Slaughter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beatty" /&gt; This decision has not been overruled and has been specifically reaffirmed several times.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'', {{ussc|529|598|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Largely as a result of the narrowness of the ''Slaughter-House'' opinion, this clause subsequently lay dormant for well over a century.&lt;ref&gt;Shaman, Jeffrey.  ''Constitutional Interpretation: Illusion and Reality'', p. 248 (Greenwood Publishing 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Saenz v. Roe]]'' (1999),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Saenz v. Roe]]'', {{ussc|526|489|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court ruled that a component of the "[[Freedom of movement|right to travel]]" is protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause:{{quote|Despite fundamentally differing views concerning the coverage of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, most notably expressed in the majority and dissenting opinions in the ''Slaughter-House Cases'' (1873), it has always been common ground that this Clause protects the third component of the right to travel. Writing for the majority in the ''Slaughter-House Cases'', Justice Miller explained that one of the privileges ''conferred by this Clause'' "is that a citizen of the United States can, of his own volition, become a citizen of any State of the Union by a bona fide residence therein, with the same rights as other citizens of that State." (emphasis added)}}
[[Samuel Freeman Miller|Justice Miller]] actually wrote in the ''Slaughter-House Cases'' that the right to become a citizen of a state (by residing in that state) "is conferred by ''the very article'' under consideration" (emphasis added), rather than by the "clause" under consideration.&lt;ref name=Slaughter /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogen, David.  ''Privileges and Immunities: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution'', p. 104 (Greenwood Publushing 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[McDonald v. Chicago]] ''(2010), Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], while concurring with the majority in incorporating the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] against the states, declared that he reached this conclusion through the Privileges or Immunities Clause instead of the Due Process Clause. [[Randy Barnett]] has referred to Justice Thomas's concurring opinion as a "complete restoration" of the Privileges or Immunities Clause.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Randy.

===Due Process Clause===
{{Main|Due Process Clause}}

In the 1884 case of ''[[Hurtado v. California]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court said:&lt;ref name=Hurtado&gt;Hurtado v. California, [https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/110/516.html 110 U.S. 516] (1884).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Due process of law in the [Fourteenth Amendment] refers to that law of the land in each state which derives its authority from the inherent and reserved powers of the state, exerted within the limits of those fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions, and the greatest security for which resides in the right of the people to make their own laws, and alter them at their pleasure.}}

The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only against the states, but it is otherwise textually identical to the Due Process Clause of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]], which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of [[procedural due process]] and [[substantive due process]].&lt;ref name="constitutional-gov"&gt;{{cite book|last=Curry|first=James A.|title=Constitutional Government: The American Experience|year=2003|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-7872-9870-8|page=210|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=qWR3pvfyI1sC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;q=two%20Due%20Process%20Clauses%20fifth%20fourteenth%20interpreted%20identically|author2=Riley, Richard B.|author3=Battiston, Richard M.|accessdate=July 14, 2013|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2009|title=Due process|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of American Business|publisher=Infobase|last=Gupta|first=Gayatri|editor-last=Folsom|editor-first=W. Davis|editor-first2=Rick|editor-last2=Boulware|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.&lt;ref name="incorp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cord|first=Robert L.|title=The Incorporation Doctrine and Procedural Due Process Under the Fourteenth Amendment: An Overview|journal=Brigham Young University Law Review|year=1987|issue=3|page=868|url=http://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1533&amp;context=lawreview|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Substantive due process====
{{main|Substantive due process}}
Beginning with ''[[Allgeyer v. Louisiana]]'' (1897),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Allgeyer v. Louisiana]]'', {{ussc|169|649|1897}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court interpreted the Due Process Clause as providing [[Substantive due process|substantive]] protection to private contracts, thus prohibiting a variety of social and economic regulation; this principle was referred to as "[[freedom of contract]]."&lt;ref name="Wests"&gt;{{Cite book|title=West's Encyclopedia of American Law|publisher=Thomson Gale|year=1998|chapter=Due Process of Law – Substantive Due Process|chapter-url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/6312/Due-Process-Law-Substantive-Due-Process.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Court struck down a law decreeing maximum hours for workers in a bakery in ''[[Lochner v. New York]]'' (1905)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lochner v. New York]]'', {{ussc|198|45|1905}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and struck down a minimum wage law in ''[[Adkins v. Children's Hospital]]'' (1923).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Adkins v. Children's Hospital]]'', {{ussc|261|525|1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' (1923),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'', {{ussc|262|390|1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court stated that the "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause
{{quote|[w]ithout doubt...denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14cfrag8_user.html |title=CRS Annotated Constitution |publisher=Cornell University Law School Legal Information Institute |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |archivedate=June 12, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HKNGO94g?url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14cfrag8_user.html |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the Court did uphold some economic regulation, such as state [[Prohibition in the United States#Development of the prohibition movement|Prohibition]] laws (''[[Mugler v. Kansas]]'', 1887),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mugler v. Kansas]]'', {{ussc|123|623|1887}}.&lt;/ref&gt; laws declaring maximum hours for mine workers (''[[Holden v. Hardy]]'', 1898),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Holden v. Hardy]]'', {{ussc|169|366|1898}}.&lt;/ref&gt; laws declaring maximum hours for female workers (''[[Muller v. Oregon]]'', 1908),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Muller v. Oregon]]'', {{ussc|208|412|1908}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s intervention in a railroad strike (''Wilson v. New'', 1917),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wilson v. New]]'', {{ussc|243|332|1917}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as federal laws regulating narcotics (''United States v. Doremus'', 1919).&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Doremus]]'', {{ussc|249|86|1919}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court repudiated, but did not explicitly overrule, the "freedom of contract" line of cases in ''[[West Coast Hotel v. Parrish]]'' (1937).&lt;ref&gt;''[[West Coast Hotel v. Parrish]]'', {{ussc|300|379|1937}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Poe v. Ullman]]'' (1961), dissenting judge [[John Marshall Harlan II]] adopted a broad view of the "liberty" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process clause:

{{quote|[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This 'liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Poe v. Ullman]]'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=642884283459215206&amp;q=planned+parenthood+of+pennsylvania+v.+casey&amp;as_sdt=6,33&amp;as_vis=1#p543 367 U.S. 497 (1961), at 543]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This broad view of liberty was adopted by the Supreme Court in ''Griswold v. Connecticut''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey|Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey]]'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&amp;q=planned+parenthood+of+pennsylvania+v.+casey&amp;as_sdt=6,33&amp;as_vis=1#p849 505 U.S. 833, at 849]&lt;/ref&gt; (for further information see below). Although the "freedom of contract" described above has fallen into disfavor, by the 1960s, the Court had extended its interpretation of substantive due process to include other rights and freedoms that are not enumerated in the Constitution but that, according to the Court, extend or derive from existing rights.&lt;ref name="Wests"/&gt; For example, the Due Process Clause is also the foundation of a constitutional [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]]. The Court first ruled that privacy was protected by the Constitution in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965), which overturned a Connecticut law criminalizing [[birth control]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', {{ussc|381|479|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote for the majority that the right to privacy was found in the "penumbras" of various provisions in the Bill of Rights, Justices [[Arthur Goldberg]] and [[John Marshall Harlan II]] wrote in concurring opinions that the "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause included individual privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001141.html|title=Griswold v. Connecticut|date=January 1, 2000|work=Encyclopedia of the American Constitution|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[right to privacy]] was the basis for ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', {{ussc|410|113|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Court invalidated a Texas law forbidding abortion except to save the mother's life. Like Goldberg's and Harlan's concurring opinions in ''Griswold'', the majority opinion authored by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] located the right to privacy in the Due Process Clause's protection of liberty. The decision disallowed many state and federal abortion restrictions, and it became one of the most controversial in the Court's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425002190.html|title=Roe v.

Wade'' should be retained and once again reaffirmed."&lt;ref&gt;Casey, 505 U.S. at 845–846.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', {{ussc|539|558|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court found that a Texas law against same-sex sexual intercourse violated the right to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-127277818.html|title=Surviving Lawrence v.

====Procedural due process====
When the government seeks to burden a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, the government provide the person notice, an opportunity to be heard at an oral hearing, and a decision by a neutral decision maker. For example, such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Bradford|title=Procedural Due Process in Plain English|publisher=[[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89133-573-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Mathews v. Eldridge]]'' (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to [[Judicial disqualification|recuse]] themselves in cases where the judge has a [[conflict of interest]]. For example, in ''[[Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.]]'' (2009),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.]]'', {{ussc|556|868|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court ruled that a justice of the [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia]] had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124447000965394255|title=Justices Set New Standard for Recusals|author1=Jess Bravin |author2=Kris Maher |date=June 8, 2009|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Incorporation====
{{Main|Incorporation of the Bill of Rights}}
While many [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] are modeled after the United States Constitution and federal laws, those state constitutions did not necessarily include provisions comparable to the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. In ''[[Barron v. Baltimore]]'' (1833),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Barron v. Baltimore]]'', {{ussc|32|243|1833}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Bill of Rights restrained only the federal government, not the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000188.html|title=Barron v. City of Baltimore 7 Peters 243 (1833)|author=Levy, Leonard W.|work=Encyclopedia of the American Constitution|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=June 13, 2013|date=January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Supreme Court has subsequently held that most provisions of the Bill of Rights apply to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment under a doctrine called "incorporation."&lt;ref name="incorp" /&gt;

Whether incorporation was intended by the amendment's framers, such as John Bingham, has been debated by legal historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YoI14vYA8r0C&amp;pg=PA145&amp;q=%22fourteenth%20amendment%22%20John%20Bingham|year=2006|title=Bingham, John Armor|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties|publisher=CRC Press|last=Foster|first=James C.|editor-first=Paul|editor-last=Finkelman|pages=145|isbn=9780415943420}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to legal scholar [[Akhil Reed Amar]], the framers and early supporters of the Fourteenth Amendment believed that it would ensure that the states would be required to recognize the same individual rights as the federal government; all of these rights were likely understood as falling within the "privileges or immunities" safeguarded by the amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amar|first=Akhil Reed|year=1992|title=The Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment|journal=[[Yale Law Journal]]|volume=101|issue=6|pages=1193–1284|doi=10.2307/796923|url=http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Amar1.html|jstor=796923|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019233856/http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Amar1.html|archivedate=October 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the latter half of the 20th century, nearly all of the rights in the Bill of Rights had been applied to the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0391_0145_ZC.html|title=''Duncan v.

On June 18, 2018, the Supreme Court agreed to hear ''[[Timbs v.

===Equal Protection Clause===
{{Main|Equal Protection Clause}}
[[File:BinghamFacingForward.jpg|thumb|Representative [[John Bingham]] of Ohio, principal author of the Equal Protection Clause]]

The Equal Protection Clause was created largely in response to the lack of equal protection provided by law in states with [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]]. Under Black Codes, blacks could not sue, give evidence, or be witnesses. They also were punished more harshly than whites.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|pp=20, 23–24}} In 1880, the Supreme Court stated in ''[[Strauder v. West Virginia]]'' that the Equal Protection Clause was

In ''[[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]]'' (1886), the Supreme Court has clarified that the meaning of "person" and "within its jurisdiction" in the Equal Protection Clause would not be limited to discrimination against African Americans, but would extend to other races, colors, and nationalities such as (in this case) [[Alien (law)|legal aliens]] in the United States who are Chinese citizens:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''[[Yick Wo v.

{{quote|text=These provisions are universal in their application to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality, and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.}}

Persons "within its jurisdiction" are entitled to equal protection from a state. Largely because the [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]] of Article IV has from the beginning guaranteed the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states, the Supreme Court has rarely construed the phrase "within its jurisdiction" in relation to natural persons.&lt;ref name="FindLaw201311234Annotation18"/&gt; In ''[[Plyler v. Doe]]'' (1982), where the Court held that aliens illegally present in a state are ''within its jurisdiction'' and may thus raise equal protection claims&lt;ref name="FindLaw201311234Annotation18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plyler"&gt;''[[Plyler v. Doe]]'', {{ussc|457|202|1982|pin=210–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court explicated the meaning of the phrase "within its jurisdiction" as follows: "[U]se of the phrase "within its jurisdiction" confirms the understanding that the Fourteenth Amendment's protection extends to anyone, citizen or stranger, who is subject to the laws of a State, and reaches into every corner of a State's territory."&lt;ref name="Plyler" /&gt; The Court reached this understanding among other things from Senator Howard, a member of the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Reconstruction|Joint Committee of Fifteen]], and the floor manager of the amendment in the Senate. Senator Howard was explicit about the broad objectives of the Fourteenth Amendment and the intention to make its provisions applicable to all who "may happen to be" within the jurisdiction of a state:&lt;ref name="Plyler" /&gt;

{{quote|The last two clauses of the first section of the amendment disable a State from depriving not merely a citizen of the United States, but ''any person, whoever he may be'', of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or from denying to him the equal protection of the laws of the State. This abolishes all class legislation in the States and does away with the injustice of subjecting one caste of persons to a code not applicable to another. ... It will, if adopted by the States, forever disable every one of them from passing laws trenching upon those fundamental rights and privileges which pertain to citizens of the United States, ''and to all person who may happen to be within their jurisdiction.'' [emphasis added by the U.S. Supreme Court]&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Globe, 39th Congress, 1st Session, 1033 (1866), page 2776&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The relationship between the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments was addressed by Justice Field in ''Wong Wing v. United States'' (1896).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wong Wing v. United States]]'', {{ussc|163|228|1896}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He observed with respect to the phrase "within its jurisdiction": "The term 'person,' used in the Fifth Amendment, is broad enough to include any and every human being within the jurisdiction of the republic. A resident, alien born, is entitled to the same protection under the laws that a citizen is entitled to. He owes obedience to the laws of the country in which he is domiciled, and, as a consequence, he is entitled to the equal protection of those laws. ... The contention that persons within the territorial jurisdiction of this republic might be beyond the protection of the law was heard with pain on the argument at the bar—in face of the great constitutional amendment which declares that no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."&lt;ref&gt;''Wong Wing'', 163 U.S. at 242–243 (Justice Field, concurring in part and dissenting in part).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court also decided whether foreign corporations are also ''within the jurisdiction'' of a state, ruling that a foreign corporation which sued in a state court in which it was not licensed to do business to recover possession of property wrongfully taken from it in another state was ''within the jurisdiction'' and could not be subjected to unequal burdens in the maintenance of the suit.&lt;ref name="FindLaw201311234Annotation18"/&gt; When a state has admitted a foreign corporation to do business within its borders, that corporation is entitled to equal protection of the laws but not necessarily to identical treatment with domestic corporations.&lt;ref name="FindLaw201311234Annotation18"/&gt;

In ''[[Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad]]'' (1886), the court reporter included a statement by Chief Justice [[Morrison Waite]] in the decision's headnote:
{{quote|The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations.

This [[dictum]], which established that corporations enjoyed [[Corporate personhood|personhood]] under the Equal Protection Clause, was repeatedly reaffirmed by later courts.&lt;ref name="Johnson2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=John W.|title=Historic U.S. Court Cases: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPDqMQv0Y6QC&amp;pg=PA446|accessdate=June 13, 2013|date=January 1, 2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93755-9|pages=446–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained the predominant view throughout the twentieth century, though it was challenged in dissents by justices such as [[Hugo Black]] and [[William O.

In the decades following the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court overturned laws barring blacks from [[juries]] (''[[Strauder v. West Virginia]]'', 1880)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Strauder v. West Virginia]]'', {{ussc|100|303|1880}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or discriminating against [[Chinese American]]s in the regulation of laundry businesses (''Yick Wo v. Hopkins'', 1886),&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; as violations of the Equal Protection Clause. However, in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', {{ussc|163|537|1896}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that the states could impose [[Racial segregation|segregation]] so long as they provided similar facilities—the formation of the "[[separate but equal]]" doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wwno/news.newsmain?action=article&amp;ARTICLE_ID=1468970|title=Plessy/Ferguson plaque dedicated|last=Abrams|first=Eve|date=February 12, 2009|publisher=WWNO (University New Orleans Public Radio)|accessdate=April 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court went even further in restricting the Equal Protection Clause in ''[[Berea College v. Kentucky]]'' (1908),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Berea College v. Kentucky]]'', {{ussc|211|45|1908}}.&lt;/ref&gt; holding that the states could force private actors to discriminate by prohibiting colleges from having both black and white students. By the early 20th century, the Equal Protection Clause had been eclipsed to the point that Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] dismissed it as "the usual last resort of constitutional arguments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0274_0200_ZO.html |title=274 U.S. 200: Buck v.

In ''[[Plyler v.

===State actor doctrine===
{{Main|State actor}}

Individual liberties guaranteed by the United States Constitution, other than the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]'s ban on slavery, protect not against actions by private persons or entities, but only against actions by government officials.&lt;ref name="Dunn20090429"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunn|first=Christopher|title=Column: Applying the Constitution to Private Actors (New York Law Journal)|url=http://www.nyclu.org/oped/column-applying-constitution-private-actors-new-york-law-journal|publisher=New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) – American Civil Liberties Union of New York State|accessdate=November 23, 2013|date=April 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' (1948):&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', {{ussc|334|1|1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]he action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful." The court added in ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' (1883):&lt;ref name=CRC /&gt; "It is State action of a particular character that is prohibited. Individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject matter of the amendment. It has a deeper and broader scope. It nullifies and makes void all State legislation, and State action of every kind, which impairs the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, or which injures them in life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or which denies to any of them the equal protection of the laws."

Vindication of federal constitutional rights are limited to those situations where there is "state action" meaning action of government officials who are exercising their governmental power.&lt;ref name="Dunn20090429" /&gt; In ''Ex parte Virginia'' (1880),&lt;ref&gt;''Ex Parte Virginia'',  {{ussc|100|339|1880}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court found that the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment "have reference to actions of the political body denominated by a State, by whatever instruments or in whatever modes that action may be taken. A State acts by its legislative, its executive, or its judicial authorities. It can act in no other way. The constitutional provision, therefore, must mean that no agency of the State, or of the officers or agents by whom its powers are exerted, shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Whoever, by virtue of public position under a State government, deprives another of property, life, or liberty, without due process of law, or denies or takes away the equal protection of the laws, violates the constitutional inhibition; and as he acts in the name and for the State, and is clothed with the State's power, his act is that of the State."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co'', {{ussc|419|345|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are however instances where people are the victims of civil-rights violations that occur in circumstances involving both government officials and private actors.&lt;ref name="Dunn20090429" /&gt; In the 1960s, the United States Supreme Court adopted an expansive view of state action opening the door to wide-ranging civil-rights litigation against private actors when they act as [[state actor]]s&lt;ref name="Dunn20090429" /&gt; (i.e., acts done or otherwise "sanctioned in some way" by the state). The Court found that the state action doctrine is equally applicable to denials of privileges or immunities, due process, and equal protection of the laws.&lt;ref name="FindLaw201311234Annotation18" /&gt;

The critical factor in determining the existence of state action is not governmental involvement with private persons or private corporations, but "the inquiry must be whether there is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; "Only by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can the nonobvious involvement of the State in private conduct be attributed its true significance."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority]]'', {{ussc|365|715|1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court asserted that plaintiffs must establish not only that a private party "acted under color of the challenged statute, but also that its actions are properly attributable to the State. [...]" &lt;ref name="Flagg"&gt;''[[Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks]]'', {{ussc|436|149|1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "And the actions are to be attributable to the State apparently only if the State compelled the actions and not if the State merely established the process through statute or regulation under which the private party acted."&lt;ref name="FindLaw201311234Annotation18" /&gt;

==Apportionment of representation in House of Representatives==
Under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Apportionment of Representatives and taxes|Article I, Section 2, Clause 3]], the basis of representation of each state in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was [[Apportionment (politics)|determined]] by adding [[Three-fifths compromise|three-fifths]] of each state's slave population to its free population. Because slavery (except as punishment for crime) had been abolished by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the freed slaves would henceforth be given full weight for purposes of apportionment.&lt;ref name="bonfield"/&gt; This situation was a concern to the Republican leadership of Congress, who worried that it would increase the political power of the former slave states, even as they continued to deny freed slaves the right to vote.&lt;ref name="bonfield"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Arthur Earl|last=Bonfield|title=The Right to Vote and Judicial Enforcement of Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment|journal=Cornell Law Review|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/clr/vol46/iss1/5/|volume=46|issue=1|date=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two solutions were considered:

* reduce the Congressional representation of the former slave states (for example, by basing representation on the number of legal voters rather than the number of inhabitants)
* guarantee freed slaves the right to vote

On January 31, 1866, the House of Representatives voted in favor of a proposed constitutional amendment that would reduce a state's representation in the House in proportion to which that state used "race or color" as a basis to deny the right to vote in that state.&lt;ref name="bonfield"/&gt; The amendment failed in the Senate, partly because radical Republicans foresaw that states would be able to use ostensibly race-neutral criteria, such as educational and property qualifications, to disenfranchise the freed slaves without negative consequence. So the amendment was changed to penalize states in which the vote was denied to male citizens over twenty-one for ''any'' reason other than participation in crime. Later, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] was adopted to guarantee the right to vote could not be denied based on race or color.

The effect of Section 2 was twofold:

* Although the three-fifths clause was not formally repealed, it was effectively removed from the Constitution. In the words of the Supreme Court in ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'', Section 2 "abrogated so much of the corresponding clause of the original Constitution as counted only three-fifths of such persons [slaves]".
* It was intended to penalize, by means of reduced Congressional representation, states that withheld the franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime. This, it was hoped, would induce the former slave states to recognize the political rights of the former slaves, without directly forcing them to do so—something that it was thought the states would not accept.&lt;ref name="bonfield"/&gt;

===Enforcement===
The first reapportionment after the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment occurred in 1873, based on the [[1870 United States Census|1870 census]]. Congress appears to have attempted to enforce the provisions of Section 2, but was unable to identify enough disenfranchised voters to make a difference to any state's representation.&lt;ref name="bonfield"/&gt; In the implementing statute, Congress added a provision stating that {{quote|should any state, after the passage of this Act, deny or abridge the right of any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, to vote at any election named in the amendments to the Constitution, article fourteen, section two, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the number of Representatives apportioned in this act to such State shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall have to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=17&amp;page=29#|title="An Act for the Apportionment of Representatives to Congress among the States according to the ninth Census", Forty-Second Congress, Sess. ii, Ch. xi, section 6. February 2, 1872|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} A nearly identical provision remains in federal law to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/6?qt-us_code_temp_noupdates=0#qt-us_code_temp_noupdates|title=2 U.S. Code § 6 - Reduction of representation|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this legislation, in subsequent reapportionments, no change has ever been made to any state's Congressional representation on the basis of the Amendment.&lt;ref name="bonfield"/&gt; Bonfield, writing in 1960, suggested that "[t]he hot political nature of such proposals has doomed them to failure".&lt;ref name="bonfield"/&gt; Aided by this lack of enforcement, [[Southern United States|southern states]] continued to use pretexts to prevent many blacks from voting until the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3444700477.html|title=Fourteenth Amendment|author=Friedman, Walter|date=January 1, 2006|work=Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth Circuit]] case of ''Saunders v Wilkins'' (1945),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/saunders-v-wilkins|title=Casetext|website=casetext.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saunders claimed that Virginia should have its Congressional representation reduced because of its use of a [[poll tax]] and other voting restrictions. The plaintiff sued for the right to run for Congress at large in the state, rather than in one of its designated Congressional districts. The lawsuit was dismissed as a [[political question]].&lt;ref name="bonfield"/&gt;

===Influence===
Some have argued that Section 2 was implicitly repealed by the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chin|first=Gabriel J.|year=2004|title=Reconstruction, Felon Disenfranchisement, and the Right to Vote: Did the Fifteenth Amendment Repeal Section 2 of the Fourteenth?|journal=[[Georgetown Law Journal]]|volume=92|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Supreme Court acknowledged the provisions of Section 2 in some later decisions. In ''[[Minor v. Happersett]]'' (1875), the Supreme Court cited Section 2 as supporting its conclusion that the right to vote was not among the "privileges and immunities of citizenship" protected by Section 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|Why this if it was not in the power of the legislature to deny the right of suffrage to some male inhabitants? And if suffrage was necessarily one of the absolute rights of citizenship, why confine the operation of the limitation to male inhabitants? Women and children are, as we have seen, "persons." They are counted in the enumeration upon which the apportionment is to be made, but if they were necessarily voters because of their citizenship unless clearly excluded, why inflict the penalty for the exclusion of males alone? Clearly, no such form of words would have been elected to express the idea here indicated if suffrage was the absolute right of all citizens.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Richardson v. Ramirez]]'' (1974), the Court cited Section 2 as justifying the states [[Felony disenfranchisement|disenfranchising felons]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Richardson v. Ramirez]]'', {{ussc|418|24|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Hunter v. Underwood]]'' (1985), a case involving disenfranchising black [[Misdemeanor|misdemeanants]], the Supreme Court concluded that the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] cannot save legislation prohibited by the subsequently enacted Fourteenth Amendment. More specifically the Court concluded that laws passed with a discriminatory purpose are not excepted from the operation of the Equal Protection Clause by the "other crime" provision of Section 2. The Court held that Section 2 "was not designed to permit the purposeful racial discrimination [...] which otherwise violates [Section] 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hunter v. Underwood]]'', {{ussc|471|222|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Abolitionist leaders criticized the amendment's failure to specifically prohibit the states from denying people the right to vote on the basis of race.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=255}}

Section 2 protects the right to vote only of adult males, not adult females, making it the only provision of the Constitution to explicitly discriminate on the basis of sex.&lt;ref name=Foner/&gt; Section 2 was condemned by [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffragists]], such as [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]], who had long seen their cause as linked to that of black rights. The separation of black civil rights from women's civil rights split the two movements for decades.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=255–256}}

==Participants in rebellion==
Section 3 prohibits the election or appointment to any federal or state office of any person who had held any of certain offices and then engaged in insurrection, rebellion, or [[Treason in the United States|treason]]. However, a two-thirds vote by each House of the Congress can override this limitation. In 1898, the Congress enacted a general removal of Section 3's limitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment14/37.html|title=Sections 3 and 4: Disqualification and Public Debt|publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com|date=June 5, 1933|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the citizenship of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general [[Robert E. Lee]] was restored by a joint congressional resolution, retroactive to June 13, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2005|title=Pieces of History: General Robert E. Lee's Parole and Citizenship|journal=Prologue Magazine|volume=37|issue=1|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2005/spring/piece-lee.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, pursuant to Section 3, the Congress posthumously removed the service ban from Confederate president [[Jefferson Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/blogs/archives/52/2006/10/ |title=History Buzz: October 16, 2006: This Week in History |last=Goodman |first=Bonnie K. |year=2006 |work=History News Network |accessdate=June 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019004128/http://hnn.us/blogs/archives/52/2006/10/ |archivedate=October 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 3 was used to prevent [[Socialist Party of America]] member [[Victor L. Berger]], convicted of violating the [[Espionage Act]] for his anti-militarist views, from [[Unseated members of the United States Congress|taking his seat]] in the House of Representatives in 1919 and 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Chapter 157: The Oath As Related To Qualifications|work=Cannon's Precedents of the U.S. House of Representatives|volume=6|date=January 1, 1936|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-HPREC-CANNONS-V6/html/GPO-HPREC-CANNONS-V6-10.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validity of public debt==
Section 4 confirmed the legitimacy of all [[National debt of the United States|public debt]] appropriated by the Congress. It also confirmed that neither the United States nor any state would pay for the loss of slaves or debts that had been incurred by the Confederacy. For example, during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] several British and French banks had lent large sums of money to the Confederacy to support its war against the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annotation 37 – Fourteenth Amendment Sections 3 and 4 Disqualification and Public Debt|url=http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment14/annotation37.html#1|publisher=FindLaw|accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gold Clause Cases|''Perry v.

The debt-ceiling crises of [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|2011]] and [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2013|2013]] raised the question of what is the President's authority under Section 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=The 14th Amendment, the Debt Ceiling and a Way Out|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/us/politics/25legal.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 30, 2011|quote=In recent weeks, law professors have been trying to puzzle out the meaning and relevance of the provision.

Because the President must obey the Section 4 requirement not to put the validity of the public debt into question, Balkin argued that President Obama is obliged "to prioritize incoming revenues to pay the public debt: interest on government bonds and any other 'vested' obligations. What falls into the latter category is not entirely clear, but a large number of other government obligations—and certainly payments for future services—would not count and would have to be sacrificed. This might include, for example, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] payments."&lt;ref name="balkin2013"/&gt;

The '''Golden Joystick Awards''', also known as the '''People's Gaming Awards''', is a [[video game]] [[award ceremony]]; it awards the [[List of Game of the Year awards|best video games of the year]], as voted for originally by the British general public,&lt;ref&gt;Weston, D.B. "Greatest Moments in Video Game History" Page 47. Published 2011&lt;/ref&gt; but can now be voted on by anyone online. {{As of|2016}}, the ceremony was in its 34th year. It is the second-oldest video game award ceremony after the [[Electronic Games|Arcade Awards]].

The awards were initially focused on [[PC game|computer games]], but were later extended to include [[console game]]s as well, owing to the success of [[video game console]]s such as the [[Sega Master System]] and the [[Sega Mega Drive]] in the United Kingdom. The ceremony is not related to the prize given away to successful contestants on ''[[GamesMaster]]'', a British television show.

{{As of|2014}}, it is the biggest video game award show in terms of the number of votes cast; over nine million votes were cast for the 2014 ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futureplc.com/golden-joystick-awards-winners-announced/ |title=Golden Joystick Awards: Winners Announced |publisher=Future plc |date=28 October 2014 |accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gordon Bennett Cup''' (or {{lang|fr|Coupe Aéronautique Gordon Bennett}}) is the world's oldest [[gas balloon]] race, and is "regarded as the premier event of world balloon racing" according to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;  Referred to as the "[[Blue ribbon|Blue Ribbon]]" of aeronautics, the first race started from [[Paris]], France, on September 30, 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200067.html |work=[[Flight Global]]|page=69| date=January 30, 1909|accessdate=September 27, 2010|title = Aero Club of the United Kingdom &amp;mdash; Official notices to members &amp;mdash; Gordon-Bennett Aeronautical Race, 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The event was sponsored by [[James Gordon Bennett, Jr.]], the millionaire sportsman and owner of the ''[[New York Herald]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coupegordonbennett.org/ |publisher=[[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] |title=The Coupe Aéronautique Gordon Bennett |accessdate=September 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009101601/http://www.coupegordonbennett.org/ |archivedate=October 9, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the organizers, the aim of the contest "is simple: to fly the furthest distance from the launch site."&lt;ref name=official/&gt;  The contest ran from 1906 to 1938, interrupted by [[World War I]] and in 1931, but was suspended in 1939 when the hosts, Poland, were invaded at the start of [[World War II]].  The event was not resurrected until 1979, when American Tom Heinsheimer, an atmospheric physicist, gained permission from the holders to host the trophy.&lt;ref name=resurrect&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1095034/1/index.htm  | title = A Bunch Of Basket Cases| first=Joe|last=Jares|accessdate=October 5, 2010|date=June 11, 1979|work = [[Sports Illustrated]]| publisher=[[Time Inc]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The competition was not officially reinstated by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) until 1983.&lt;ref name=minutes&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fai.org/ballooning/system/files/CIA-Policy-Manual-to-1997.doc | format = doc | accessdate = October 5, 2010 | title = CIA Policy Manual | date = June 1997 | page = C6/6 | quote = The First Official Gordon Bennett Cup race since 1938 will take place on 26 June 1983, from Place de la Concorde in Paris, the same spot where the first race started on September 30th 1906. | publisher = [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110809181951/http://www.fai.org/ballooning/system/files/CIA-Policy-Manual-to-1997.doc | archivedate = 9 August 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record time for the winner of the event is held by Germans Wilhelm Eimers and Bernd Landsmann who remained airborne for over 92 hours in the 1995 race,&lt;ref name=winning&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.coupegordonbennett.org/system/files/CIA-GB-Winning-Pilots.xls | title = Winning pilots and co-pilots (alphabetic list) | accessdate = September 27, 2010 | publisher = [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] | format = [[Microsoft Excel|xls]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101008041306/http://www.coupegordonbennett.org/system/files/CIA-GB-Winning-Pilots.xls | archivedate = October 8, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; taking off from Switzerland and landing four days later in Latvia.  The distance record is held by the Belgian duo of Bob Berben and Benoît Siméons who, in 2005, piloted their balloon {{convert|3400|km|sp=us}} from [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], United States, to [[Saint-Michel-du-Squatec, Quebec|Squatec, Quebec]], Canada.&lt;ref name=winning/&gt;  The most successful pilot is French [[Vincent Leys]] who won the trophy nine times between 1997 and 2017, while American teams have won on the most occasions, with twelve victories.

The 2010 competition started in the United Kingdom, with the balloons departing from [[Bristol]] on September 25.  The race was marred by the disappearance of the American team during a storm over the Adriatic Sea on October 1.&lt;ref name=calledoff&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-11471461 | title = Italian coastguards call off search for US balloonists| date = October 4, 2010| accessdate=October 4, 2010| publisher = [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balloon was missing until December 6, when a fishing vessel found the cabin containing the pilots' bodies off the coast of Italy.&lt;ref name=foundBBC&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11925697 | title = Bodies of missing US balloonists found off Italy| date = December 6, 2010| accessdate=December 6, 2010|publisher = [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2013 event, departing from France and landing in Portugal, was again won by the French in ''F-PPGB''.&lt;ref name="2013results" /&gt;

==Rules==
According to the official rules, the competition is open to all National Aero Clubs (NACs) "who have met their obligations to the FAI", with each NAC being allowed to enter up to three teams whose pilots are of the same nationality as the NAC.&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.fai.org/ballooning/system/files/CIA-GB-MER-2010.doc| format=doc| title=Model Event Rules for Coupe Aéronautique Gordon Bennett| year=2010| accessdate=September 28, 2010| publisher=[[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]]| page=2| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809180044/http://www.fai.org/ballooning/system/files/CIA-GB-MER-2010.doc| archivedate=August 9, 2011| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before this, only two teams from any single NAC were permitted to compete in a single competition.&lt;ref name=story1983/&gt;  Pilots should have at least 50 hours experience as pilot in command and be authorized for night-time flying.  At least one member of each team must be capable of communicating with Air Traffic Control in English.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

The team who wins the contest receives the Coupe Aéronautique Gordon Bennett trophy and the team's NAC will hold the contest two years later (originally the winning NAC would host the competition the following year).  Any NAC winning the cup in three consecutive races will be the final holder of the cup with the  subsequent option to offer a new cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.fai.org/ballooning/system/files/CIA-GB-MER-2010.doc| format=doc| title=Model Event Rules for Coupe Aéronautique Gordon Bennett| year=2010| accessdate=September 28, 2010| publisher=[[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]]| pages=5, 10&amp;ndash;11| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809180044/http://www.fai.org/ballooning/system/files/CIA-GB-MER-2010.doc| archivedate=August 9, 2011| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unofficial events==
Resurrected in 1979 by American [[Tom Heinsheimer]], the competition was held without official FAI sanction for four years.  [[Ben Abruzzo]] and [[Maxie Anderson]] secured victory piloting Double Eagle III {{convert|987|km|sp=us}} in 47 hours from California to Colorado.&lt;ref name=resurrect/&gt;  The following year, the winning team of Jerry Tepper and Corky Myers floated {{convert|862|km|sp=us}} from the takeoff point in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n6ISAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_vYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6571,1358180&amp;dq=gordon+bennett&amp;hl=en | title = 2 Denver pilots win Gordon Bennett race | work = [[The Bulletin (Bend)|The Bulletin]] |location=[[Bend, Oregon]]| accessdate= October 5, 2010| date = April 30, 1980| page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1981 race was won again by Abruzzo, with different co-pilot Rocky Aoki, who covered {{convert|2168|km|sp=us}} before touching down,&lt;ref name=eightyonetwo/&gt; while the 1982 race was won by [[Joe Kittinger]] and Charles Knapp who piloted Rosie O'Grady {{convert|1423|km|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=eightyonetwo&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=THgUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pgIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6858,7131960&amp;dq=gordon-bennett+1980+balloon&amp;hl=en | title = Balloonists' 884-Mile Flight Is Tops In Endurance Race | work = [[Toledo Blade]] | publisher = [[Block Communications]]| accessdate= October 5, 2010 | date = May 10, 1982 | page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heinsheimer attempted to gain the copyright over the name "Gordon Bennett" and run the event without FAI sanction.

== Incidents ==
[[File:Conqueror draped over houses of Berlin 1908.jpg|thumb|Conqueror draped over houses of Berlin 1908]]
The 1908 race in Berlin saw the fall of the balloon Conqueror, flown by A. Holland Forbes and [[Augustus Post]]. Conqueror was the largest balloon entered in the race, standing 80 feet high and with a gas capacity of 80,000 cubic feet. Before the race Forbes had attempted to lengthen the balloon's appendix to give the team a strategic advantage. Instead the balloon hit a fence just after take off, lost two ballast bags, ascended rapidly and ripped open three minutes into the race. The pair slashed off ballast as they fell 3,000 feet. Their descent was slowed only as the balloon's fabric caught in the netting and formed a rough parachute. They took hold of the ring above them and lifted their feet as the basket smashed through the tiled roof of a house in the Berlin suburb of Friedenau. Both the men and their instruments survived intact.&lt;ref&gt;Post, Augustus (October 1908). [http://www.unz.org/Pub/Century-1910oct-00935?View=PDF "A Fall From the Sky"].

[[File:Hawley and Post following 1910 Gordon Bennett cup.png|thumb|Hawley and Post following 1910 Gordon Bennett Cup]]
The winners of the 1910 Gordon Bennett Cup, [[Alan R. Hawley]] and [[Augustus Post]], set a distance and duration record of 1,173 miles in 44 hours and 25 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/gordonbennett/results|title=Results|last=Carrera|first=Faustine|website=www.fai.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-06-23}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the pair of experienced balloonists landed in a remote section of Canadian wilderness in Quebec. After a week passed with no word from the team, search parties were formed by the [[Aero Club of America]], but many newspapers reported that the men were likely dead. Instead they emerged after ten days, assisted by two local trappers who had been out on a hunting trip and happened to run into them. Hawley had injured a knee, but otherwise the pair were unharmed and received a hero's welcome upon their safe return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j4tHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA451&amp;lpg=PA451&amp;dq=%22A+record+voyage+in+the+air%22+augustus+post&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6ALG7HT-zH&amp;sig=lq2PS9XTIwaNroCYXbOaPjYWRe4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbyuOtl5_UAhUB24MKHUuRBcoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20record%20voyage%20in%20the%20air%22%20augustus%20post&amp;f=false|title=A Record Voyage in the Air|last=Post|first=Augustus|publisher=Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine|year=1911|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 1923, five competitors were killed when they were struck by lightning while six more were injured in storms. Among the dead were Lieutenants John W. Choptaw and Robert S.

On September 12, 1995, three [[gas balloon]]s participating in the race entered [[Belarus]]ian air space. Despite the fact that competition organizers had informed the Belarusian Government about the race in May and that flight plans had been filed, a [[Mil Mi-24|Mil Mi-24B]] attack helicopter of the [[Belarusian Air Force]] shot down one balloon,&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/14/world/2-american-balloonists-die-when-shot-down-in-belarus.html| work =[[The New York Times]] | publisher = The New York Times Company| accessdate=September 28, 2010|date=September 14, 1995|title = 2 American Balloonists Die When Shot Down in Belarus|first=Malcolm W.|last=Browne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://flightsafety.org/ap/ap_july96.pdf| format=pdf|publisher=[[Flight Safety Foundation]] | accessdate=September 28, 2010|date=July 1996 | title = Racing Balloon Is Shot Down by Attack Helicopter in Belarus}}&lt;/ref&gt; killing two American citizens, Alan Fraenckel and John Stuart-Jervis.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1995-09-15/news/mn-46149_1_american-balloon | accessdate=September 28, 2010| date=September 15, 1995| title = Ill-Fated Balloonists Shared Passion for Flying| first=Marlene|last=Cimons|author2=Williams, Carol J.|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher = [[Tribune Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/belarus-shoots-down-us-balloon-1600976.html | work = [[The Independent]] | accessdate=September 28, 2010| date = September 14, 1995| title = Belarus shoots down US balloon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the balloons was forced to land while the third landed safely over two hours after the initial downing.

'''Historical documents''' are original [[document]]s that contain important historical information about a person, place, or event and can thus serve as [[primary sources]] as important ingredients of the [[historical method]]ology.

Significant historical documents can be [[deed]]s, laws, accounts of battles (often given by the victors or persons sharing their viewpoint), or the exploits of the powerful. Though these documents are of historical interest, they do not detail the daily lives of ordinary people, or the way society functioned. [[Anthropologist]]s, [[historians]] and [[archeologists]] generally are more interested in documents that describe the [[everyday life|day-to-day lives]] of ordinary people, indicating what they ate, their interaction with other members of their households and social groups, and their states of mind. It is this [[information]] that allows them to try to understand and describe the way society was functioning at any particular time in [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prattlibrary.org/research/tools/index.aspx?cat=19963&amp;id=83744|title=Exploring Daily Life throughout History: How Did They Live?|publisher=[[Enoch Pratt Free Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek [[ostraka]] provide good examples of historical documents from "among the [[common people]]".

Many documents that are produced today, such as personal letters, pictures, contracts, newspapers, and medical records, would be considered valuable historical documents in the [[future]]. However most of these will be lost in the future since they are either printed on ordinary paper which has a limited lifespan, or even stored in [[Digital data|digital]] formats, then lost track over time.

Some companies and government entities are attempting to increase the number of documents that will survive the passage of time, by taking into account the preservation issues, and either printing documents in a manner that would increase the likelihood of them surviving indefinitely, or placing selected documents in [[time capsule]]s or other special [[information storage|storage]] environments.

'''Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (2017)''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Homage to Two Legends") was a major [[professional wrestling]] event produced and scripted by [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL; Spanish for "World Wrestling Council") that took place on March 17, 2016. The show, like all of CMLL's major shows took place in [[Arena México]], [[Mexico City, Mexico]], CMLL's home venue, nicknamed "the Cathedral of Lucha Libre". The 2017 event was the 23rd event in the [[Homenaje a Dos Leyendas]] series of shows. The event paid homage to CMLL founder [[Salvador Lutteroth]], who is always honored at ''Dos Leyendas'', as well as Arturo Díaz Mendoza, better known under the [[ring name]] [[Villano III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/lucha-libre/2017/01/18/el-cmll-reconocera-al-villano-iii-en-homenaje-a-dos-leyendas | trans-titleCMLL will recognize Villano III at Homenaje a Dos Leyendas= | date=January 18, 2017 | accessdate=January 19, 2017 | language=Spanish | work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | title=El CMLL reconocerá al Villano III en Homenaje a dos Leyendas}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main event of the show was a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or bet match, where [[Diamante Azul]] defeated [[Comandante Pierroth|Pierroth]], forcing Pierroth to unmask after the loss.. The Sky Team ([[Místico II|Místico]], [[Valiente (wrestler)|Valiente]] and [[Volador Jr]]) defend the [[CMLL World Trios Championship]] against [[Los Hijos del Infierno]] ([[Luciferno]] and [[Mephisto (wrestler)|Mephisto]]) and [[Hechicero]]. [[Último Guerrero]] successfully defended the [[NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship]] against [[Matt Taven]].

===Background===
Since 1996 the Mexican [[wrestling promotion|wrestling company]] [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (Spanish for "World Wrestling Council"; CMLL) has held a show in March each year to commemorate the passing of CMLL founder [[Salvador Lutteroth]] who died in March 1987.&lt;ref name=Lutteroth&gt;{{cite book|title=Lucha Libre: Masked Superstars of Mexican Wrestling|publisher=Distributed Art Publishers, Inc.|year=2005|chapter=Los Lutteroth / the Lutteroths|pages=20–27|isbn=968-6842-48-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first three years the show paid homage to Lutteroth himself, from 1999 through 2004 the show paid homage to Lutteroth and [[El Santo]], Mexico's most famous wrestler ever&lt;ref name=MondoSanto&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=Okay... what is Lucha Libre?|pages=29–40|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 2005 forward the show has paid homage to Lutteroth and a different ''leyenda'' ("Legend") each year, celebrating the career and accomplishments of past CMLL stars. Originally billed as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth, it has been held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas ("Homage to two legends") since 1999 and is the only show outside of [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Anniversary Shows|CMLL's Anniversary shows]] that CMLL has presented every year since its inception. All Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows have been held in [[Arena México]] in [[Mexico City, Mexico]] which is CMLL's main venue, its "home".&lt;ref name=Mondo&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=El nacimient de un sueño (the birth of a dream)|pages=41–50|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows replace their regularly scheduled [[CMLL Super Viernes|Super Viernes]] show.&lt;ref name=Mondo/&gt; The 2017 show was the 23rd overall Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show produced by CMLL.

===Storylines===
The event featured six [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

===Homage to Salvador Lutteroth and Villano III===
{{main|Salvador Lutteroth|Villano III}}
In September 1933 [[Salvador Lutteroth González]] founded [[Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL), which would later be renamed Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. Over time Lutteroth would become responsible for building both [[Arena Coliseo]] in Mexico City and [[Arena Mexico]], which became known as "The Cathedral of Lucha Libre".&lt;ref name=Lutteroth&gt;{{cite book|title=Lucha Libre: Masked Superstars of Mexican Wrestling|publisher=Distributed Art Publishers, Inc.|year=2005|chapter=Los Lutteroth / the Lutteroths|pages=20–27|isbn=968-6842-48-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MondoStart&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=El nacimient de un sueño (the birth of a dream)|pages=41–50|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time EMLL became the oldest wrestling promotion in the world, with 2018 marking the 85th year of its existence.&lt;ref name=WON&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.f4wonline.com/mexico/cmll-85th-aniversario-live-results-hair-vs-hair-tag-team-main-event-265781 | title=CMLL 85.

Lutteroth died on September 5, 1987.&lt;ref name=Lutteroth/&gt; EMLL, late CMLL, remained under the ownership and control of the Lutteroth family as first Salvador's son Chavo Lutteroth and later his grandson [[Paco Alonso]] took over ownership of the company.&lt;ref name="wonhof"&gt;{{cite book | last = Meltzer | first = Dave | title = Wrestling Observer Newsletter - September 8th 2008 | date= September 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The life and achievements of Salvador Lutteroth is always honored at the annual Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show, since 1999 CMLL has also honored a second person, a ''Leyenda'' of lucha libre, in some ways CMLL's version of their [[Hall of Fame]]. In 2017 CMLL chose to honor Arturo Díaz Mendoza, best known under the [[ring name]] [[Villano III]] ("Villain 3") for his life and career in Lucha Libre. Arturo Mendoza was the middle son of wrestler/promoter [[Ray Mendoza]], following José de Jesús Díaz Mendoza (aka. [[Villano I]]) and José Alfredo Díaz Mendoz ([[Villano II]]) and younger brothers Raymundo Díaz Mendoza Jr. ([[Villano V]]) and Tomas Díaz Mendoza ([[Villano V]]). His career really took off when Ray Mendoza, [[Francisco Flores (wrestling)|Francisco Flores]] and Benjamin Mora Jr. broke away from CMLL to form the [[Universal Wrestling Association]] (UWA) where Arturo became one of the stars of their lighter weight divisions holding the [[UWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship]],&lt;ref name=UWAJunior&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|chapter=Mexico: Universal Wrestling Federation Light Heavyweight Title|page=397|year=2000|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[UWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship]],&lt;ref name=UWAJrLight&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter=Mexico: Universal Wrestling Federation Junior Light Heavyweight Title|page=397|year=2000|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[UWA World Light Heavyweight Championship]] twice,&lt;ref name=UWALHeavy&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|chapter=Mexico: UWA Lightweight Title|page=400|year=2000|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[UWA World Welterweight Championship]]&lt;ref name=UWAWelter&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|chapter=Mexico: Universal Wrestling Federation Welterweight Heavyweight Title|page=397|year=2000|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[WWF Light Heavyweight Championship]] 7 times.&lt;ref name=WWFLHeavy&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|year=2006|edition=4th|chapter=Mexico: UWA WWF World Light Heavyweight Title|page=399|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Though Villano III won the title seven times, none of the reigns are officially recognized by the [[WWE]]. No reign prior to December 1997 is officially recognized by the WWE.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years Villano III defended his mask in a multitude of ''[[Luchas de Apuestas]]'' matches, with more than 30 mask wins on his record, including unmasking Super Astro and [[Chris Benoit|Pegasus Kid]].&lt;ref name=V3Apuestas&gt;{{Cite news|title=Luchas 2000|work=Villano III y sus Victimas|publisher=Publicaciones citem, S.A. de C.V.|location=[[Ciudad Juárez|Juárez]], Mexico|id=Especial 30|pages=24–27|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late-1999/early-2000 Villano III started a storyline feud with [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]] that led to both wrestlers putting their mask on the line at the 2000 [[Juicio Final (2000)|Juicio Final]]. Villano III lost the match and his mask in what was voted as the [[Wrestling Observer]] [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Match of the Year|Match of the Year]] for 2001. In subsequent years Arturo's career slowed down as age and injuries took a toll on him.

{{Peru conflict}}

The '''internal conflict in Peru''' is an ongoing [[armed conflict]] between the [[Government of Peru]], [[Shining Path|the Communist Party of Peru]] (better known as ''Shining Path'' or "PCP-SL"), and the [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]]. The conflict began on May 17, 1980. Estimates indicate that there have been nearly 70,000 deaths, making it the bloodiest war in [[History of Peru|Peruvian history]] since the [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization of the country]]. 

The high death toll includes many civilian casualties resulting from deliberate targeting by many factions. Recently, however, the conflict has become dormant as the number of deaths dropped significantly since the year 2000. There were low-level resurgences of violence in 2002 and 2014 when conflict erupted between the Peruvian Army and guerrilla remnants in the VRAEM region. The conflict has lasted for over 38 years, making it the second longest internal conflict in the [[history of Latin America]], after the [[Colombian armed conflict]].

==Background==
Prior to the conflict, Peru had undergone a series of coups with frequent switches between different parties and ideologies. On October 2, 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brands|first=Hal|date=2010-09-14|title=The United States and the Peruvian Challenge, 1968–1975|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09592296.2010.508418|journal=Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=471–490|doi=10.1080/09592296.2010.508418|issn=0959-2296}}&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] staged a [[military coup]] and became Peru's 56th president under the administration of the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces, a left-leaning military dictatorship.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Following a period of widespread poverty and unemployment, Velasco himself was overthrown by a bloodless [[Tacnazo|military coup]] on August 29, 1975, and was replaced by [[Francisco Morales Bermúdez]] as the new [[President of Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/30/archives/president-of-peru-ousted-in-coup-led-by-the-military-peruvian.html|title=President of Peru Ousted In Coup Led by the Military|last=Hofmann|first=Paul|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morales made an announcement that his rule would provide a "Second Phase" to the previous administration which would bring great political and economic reform to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/francisco-morales-bermudez-cerruti|title=Francisco Morales-Bermúdez Cerruti Facts|website=biography.yourdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was unsuccessful in delivering on his promises and in 1978 a Constitutional Assembly was created to replace Peru's 1933 Constitution. Morales then proclaimed that national elections would be held by 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/29/archives/perus-military-regime-pledges-civilian-rule-in-1980.html|title=Peru's Military Regime Pledges Civilian Rule in 1980|last=Onis|first=Juan de|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elections were held for the Constituent Assembly on June 18, 1978, martial law was imposed on January 6, 1979, and the Assembly approved the new constitution in July 1979. On May 18, 1980 Fernando Belaunda Terry was elected president. During the years between February 1966 and July 1980 about 500 people died in political violence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uca.edu/politicalscience/dadm-project/western-hemisphere-region/peru-1912-present/|title=13.  Peru (1912-present)|website=uca.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many affiliated with Peru's Communist Party had opposed the creation of the new constitution and formed the extremist organization known as the "Shining Path". This ultimately led to the beginning of Peru's internal conflict, with the first attacks taking place only a day before the elections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Despite this, national elections continued and [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]] was elected as the 58th President of Peru in 1980. Terry had already served as the country's 55th president prior to Velasco's coup in 1968.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Rise of Shining Path==
During the governments of Velasco and Morales, [[Shining Path]] had been organized as a [[Maoism|Maoist]] political group based at the [[San Cristóbal of Huamanga University]] in the [[Ayacucho Region]]. It was founded in 1970, and led by [[Abimael Guzmán]], a communist professor of philosophy at the San Cristóbal of Huamanga University. Guzmán had been inspired by the [[Cultural Revolution]], which he had witnessed first-hand during a trip to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shining-Path|title=Shining Path {{!}} Peruvian revolutionary organization|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shining Path members engaged in street fights with members of other political groups and painted [[graffiti]] exhorting "armed struggle" against the Peruvian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.georgiastandards.org/resources/Lexile_in_Action/SSWH20_1040.pdf|title=Abimael Guzman and the Shining Path|last=Streissguth|first=Thomas|date=5 November 2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outbreak of hostilities==
When Peru's [[Military dictatorship|military government]] allowed [[Elections in Peru|elections]] for the first time in a dozen years in 1980, Shining Path was one of the few [[leftist]] political groups that declined to take part, instead opting to launch [[guerrilla warfare]] actions against the state in the highlands of the province of [[Ayacucho Region|Ayacucho]]. On May 17, 1980, the eve of [[Peruvian general election, 1980|the presidential elections]], they burned ballot boxes in the town of [[Chuschi|Chuschi,]] Ayacucho. It was the first "act of terrorism" by Shining Path. Nonetheless, the perpetrators were quickly caught and additional ballots were brought in to replace the burned ballots; the elections proceeded without any further incidents with the act receiving very little attention in the Peruvian press.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shining Path: A History of the Millenarian War in Peru.'' p. 17. Gorriti, Gustavo trans. Robin Kirk, The University of North Carolina Press: Chapel Hill and London, 1999 ({{ISBN|0-8078-4676-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Shining Path opted to fight in the style taught by [[Mao Zedong]].  They would open up "guerrilla zones" in which their guerrillas could operate and drive government forces out of these zones to create "liberated zones." These zones would then be used to support new guerrilla zones until the entire country was essentially one big "liberated zone."  Shining Path also adhered to Mao's teaching that guerrilla should be fought primarily in the countryside and gradually choke off the cities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

On December 3, 1982, the Shining Path officially formed a "People's Guerrilla Army", its armed wing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement==
{{main|Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement}}
[[File:Flag of the MRTA.svg|thumb|left|The flag of the MRTA|180px]]

In 1982, the [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] (MRTA) launched its own guerrilla against the Peruvian state. The group had been formed by remnants of the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Peru)|Movement of the Revolutionary Left]] in Peru and identified with [[Politics of Fidel Castro|Castroite]] guerrilla movements in other parts of Latin America. The MRTA used techniques that were more traditional to Latin American [[leftist]] organizations than those used by Shining Path. For example, the MRTA wore uniforms, claimed to be fighting for true democracy and complained of human rights abuses by the state, while Shining Path did not wear uniforms and had little regard for the democratic process and human rights.&lt;ref name="Available online"&gt;La Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación.  ''Final Report.''  "General Conclusions." [http://www.cverdad.org.pe/ingles/ifinal/conclusiones.php Available online].  Accessed February 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2018}}

During the conflict, the MRTA and Shining Path engaged in combat with each other. The MRTA played a small part in the overall conflict, being declared by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to have been responsible for 1.5% of deaths accumulated throughout the conflict.

==Escalation of the conflict==
{{History of Peru}}
The reaction of the Shining Path to the Peruvian government's use of the military in the conflict was not to back down, but instead to ramp up the level of violence in the countryside.  Shining Path attacked police officers, soldiers, and civilians that it considered to be "class enemies", often using particularly gruesome methods{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} of killing their victims.  These killings, along with Shining Path's disrespect for the culture of indigenous peasants{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} it claimed to represent, turned many people in the sierra away from the group.

Faced with a hostile population, the Shining Path's guerrilla began to falter. In some areas, some fearful, well-off peasants formed anti-Shining Path patrols, called ''rondas''. They were generally poorly equipped, despite donations of guns from the armed forces. Nevertheless, Shining Path guerrillas were militarily attacked by the ''rondas''. The first such reported attack was in January 1983 near [[Huata]], where some ''rondas'' killed 13 guerrillas; in February in Sacsamarca, ''rondas'' stabbed and killed the Shining Path commanders of that area. In March 1983, ''rondas'' brutally killed Olegario Curitomay, one of the commanders of the town of [[Lucanamarca]]. They took him to the town square, stoned him, stabbed him, set him on fire and finally, shot him.&lt;ref name=Huancasancos&gt;La Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación.

Other incidents followed, such as the one in [[Hauyllo]], [[Tambo District, La Mar|Tambo District]], [[La Mar Province]]and Ayacucho Department. In that community, Shining Path killed 47 peasants, including 14 children aged four to fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International.  "Peru:  Human rights in a time of impunity."  February 2006.

==Administration of Alberto Fujimori (1990–2000) and decline==
Under the administration of [[Alberto Fujimori]] the state started its widespread use of intelligence agencies in its fight against Shining Path. Some atrocities were allegedly committed by the [[National Intelligence Service (Peru)|National Intelligence Service]], notably the [[La Cantuta massacre]], the [[Barrios Altos massacre]] and the [[Santa massacre]].

On April 5, 1992, Fujimori dissolved the [[Congress of Peru]] and abolished the Constitution, initiating the [[Peruvian Constitutional Crisis of 1992]]. The reason for these actions was that the Congress was slow to pass anti-terrorism legislation. Fujimori set up military courts to try suspected members of the Shining Path and MRTA, and ordered that an "iron fist" approach be used.  Fujimori also announced that Peru would no longer be under the jurisdiction of the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]].

As Shining Path began to lose ground in the Andes to the Peruvian state and the rondas, it decided to speed up its overall strategic plan.  Shining Path declared that it had reached "strategic equilibrium" and was ready to begin its final assault on the cities of Peru.  In 1992, Shining Path set off a powerful bomb in the [[Miraflores District, Lima|Miraflores District]] of [[Lima]] in what became known as the [[Tarata bombing]].  This was part of a larger bombing campaign to follow suit in Lima.

On September 12, 1992, Peruvian police captured Guzmán and several Shining Path leaders in an apartment above a dance studio in the [[Surquillo]] district of Lima. The police had been monitoring the apartment, as a number of suspected Shining Path militants had visited it.  An inspection of the garbage of the apartment produced empty tubes of a skin cream used to treat [[psoriasis]], a condition that Guzmán was known to have. Shortly after the raid that captured Guzmán, most of the remaining Shining Path leadership fell as well.&lt;ref&gt;Rochlin, James F. ''Vanguard Revolutionaries in Latin America:  Peru, Colombia, Mexico.'' p. 71.  Lynne Rienner Publishers:  Boulder and London, 2003. ({{ISBN|1-58826-106-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Shining Path suffered embarrassing military defeats to peasant self-defense organizations – supposedly its social base – and the organization fractured into splinter groups.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Guzmán's role as the leader of Shining Path was taken over by [[Óscar Ramírez]], who himself was captured by Peruvian authorities in 1999. After Ramírez's capture, the group splintered, guerrilla activity diminished sharply and previous conditions returned to the areas where the Shining Path had been active.&lt;ref name=activity&gt;Rochlin, James F. ''Vanguard Revolutionaries in Latin America:  Peru, Colombia, Mexico.'' pp. 71–72. [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]: Boulder and London, 2003.  ({{ISBN|1-58826-106-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Some Shining Path and MRTA remnants managed to stage minor scale attacks, such as the January 1993 wave of attacks and political assassinations that occurred in the run-up to the municipal elections, which also targeted US interests; these included the bombing of two [[Coca-Cola]] plants on January 22 (by Shining Path); the [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] attack against the [[United States Information Agency|USIS]] Binational Center on January 16; the bombing of a [[KFC]] restaurant on January 21 (both by the MRTA) and the car-bombing of the Peruvian headquarters of [[IBM]] on January 28 (by Shining Path).&lt;ref name=19813.pdf&gt;https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/19813.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2-3}} On July 27, 1993, Shining Path militants drove a car bomb into the US Embassy in Lima, which left extensive damage on the complex (worth some USD$250.000) and nearby buildings.&lt;ref name=19813.pdf/&gt;{{rp|7-9}}

Shining Path confined to their former headquarters in the Peruvian jungle and continued smaller attacks against the military, like the one that occurred on October 2, 1999, when a [[Peruvian Army]] helicopter was shot down by SP guerrillas near [[Satipo (town)|Satipo]] (killing 5) and stealing a [[PK machine gun|PKM]] machine gun which was reportedly used in another attack against an [[Mil Mi-17|Mi-17]] in July 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agenciaperu.com/investigacion/2003/jul/helicoptero.htm |title=INVESTIGACIÓN &amp;#124; Sendero atacó helicóptero en el que viajaba general EP |publisher=agenciaperu.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Shining Path being mostly defeated, more that 25% of Peru's national territory remained under a [[state of emergency]] until early 2000.&lt;ref name="FTWD"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Financial Times]] World Desk Reference|last1=Heritage|first1=Andrew|date=December 2002|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=|isbn=9780789488053|location=|pages=462-465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Truth and Reconciliation Commission==
Alberto Fujimori resigned the Presidency in 2000, but Congress declared him "morally unfit", installing the opposite congress member [[Valentín Paniagua]] into office. He rescinded Fujimori's announcement that Peru would leave the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and established a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (CVR) to investigate the conflict. The commission was headed by the President of [[Catholic University]] [[Salomón Lerner Febres]]. The Commission found in its 2003 ''Final Report'' that 69,280 people died or [[Forced disappearance|disappeared]] between 1980 and 2000 as a result of the armed conflict.&lt;ref name=CVRdead&gt;Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación.

{{Campaignbox Jamaican political conflict}}

The '''Jamaican political conflict''' is a long standing feud between right-wing and left-wing elements in the country, often exploding into violence. The [[Jamaican Labor Party]] and the [[People's National Party]] have fought for control of the island for years and the rivalry has encouraged urban warfare in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Each side believes the other to be controlled by foreign elements, the JLP is said to be backed by the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the PNP is said to been backed by the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/09/05/jamaicas-political-war/e62395de-1e45-4a88-b4d2-7e90e26a1fca/?utm_term=.06d2e65b8796 |title=Jamaica's Political War |date=September 5, 1994|publisher=[[Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Beginning===
By 1943 the JLP and PNP had established themselves as Jamaica's main rival political parties coming out of the recent [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934–39|Caribbean labor unrest]]. After the [[Jamaican general election, 1944|election of 1944]] violence became a common aspect of their rivalry. [[Alexander Bustamante]] began to encourage the attack of PNP sympathizers, claiming they were communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac:157025 |title=The Evolution of Political Violence in Jamaica 1940-1980 |last=Williams |first=Karen |publisher=[[Columbia University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Escalation===
Political violence had become commonplace in Jamaica. Political parties began paying off crime bosses for local gang support. Assassination threats and attempts also starting becoming more frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Assassination-plots-and-the-birth-of-political-violence-in-Jamaica_18348840 |title=Assassination plots and the birth of political violence in Jamaica |publisher=Jamaica Observer }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sporadic political violence would evolve into outright urban warfare after a series of violent outbursts. The [[Henry rebellion]], the [[Coral Gardens uprising]], the [[anti-Chinese riots of 1965]], the state of emergency of 1966-67, and finally the [[Rodney riots]]. These events sparked an emerging ethnic nationalist element to the political conflict and increased partisan warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjvpAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=rasta+rebellion+1960&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HwZahJkr0W&amp;sig=eKg9yM0Om-zcQYxuWJxp7_wpShs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjonJ7WyqbcAhXD21MKHZgcCtsQ6AEwEXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rasta%20rebellion%201960&amp;f=false |title=Violence and Politics in Jamaica, 1960-70: Internal Security in a Developing Country |last=Lacey |first=Terry |publisher=Jamaica Observer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1976 election over a hundred had been murdered during the conflict and political parties began forming paramilitary divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.libraries.wsu.edu/spring2017/2017/01/20/political-violence-in-jamaica |title=Political Violence in Jamaica  |last=Fisher |first=Trey|publisher=Washington State University }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 five [[Green Bay massacre|JLP supporters were massacred]] by official Jamaican soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gunst|first1=Laurie|title=Born Fi' Dead|publisher=Canongate Books Ltd|isbn=978-1841953861|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=noe6wTVKdfkC&amp;pg=PT99&amp;lpg=PT99&amp;dq=%22green+bay%22+%22Major+Ian+Robinson%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b8AvqXGFgQ&amp;sig=_HBN_PlsJZQXPdOtiEvZLuxHM70&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj57fPLiMLWAhXKa7wKHbXWA8gQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22green%20bay%22%20%22Major%20Ian%20Robinson%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reggae]] music became a voice for peace in the country and the landmark [[One Love Peace Concert]] was held in hopes of peace. By the 1980 election 844 people were murdered in political violence preceding the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/The-bloody-general-election-that-changed-Jamaica |title=The bloody general election that changed Jamaica |publisher=Jamaica Observer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
Despite many peace accords it is still common for political parties to pay off criminals for support and encourage paramilitary garrisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100321/focus/focus3.html |title=Evolution Of Garrison Politics |publisher=Jamaica Gleamer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jobar chemical attacks''' allegedly occurred in [[Jobar]], [[Damascus]], Syria, in April 2013. A reporter and a photographer for the French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' spent two months in Jobar reporting on the attacks.&lt;ref name=LeMonde&gt;{{cite web |first=Jean-Philippe |last=Remy |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/proche-orient/article/2013/05/27/chemical-war-in-syria_3417708_3218.html |title=Chemical warfare in Syria |work=Le Monde |date=27 May 2013 |accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Martin |last=Chulov |first2=Julian |last2=Borger |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/28/syria-medics-treat-rebels-symptoms-chemical-exposure |title=Syria medics treat hundreds of rebels for 'symptoms of chemical exposure'|work=Guardian |accessdate=1 April 2016 |location=London |date=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the U.N. mission which investigated the attack could not find "sufficient or credible information" to support the allegation.&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt;{{rp|page=10}} 

[[Syrian rebels]] claimed the government used chemical weapons in Jobar in early April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Times of Israel |date=7 April 2013 |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/rebels-claim-assad-used-chemical-weapons-in-damascus-attack/ |title=Rebels claim Assad used chemical weapons in Damascus attack |first=Asher |last=Zeiger |first2=Stuart |last2=Winer |accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Monde'' reported that gas attacks on the rebels occurred regularly in April and that [[Free Syrian Army]] fighters carried gas masks and had syringes with doses of [[atropine]], the antidote of [[sarin]].&lt;ref name=LeMonde/&gt; Chemical weapons expert Jean Pascal Zanders expressed doubt that the events described in Jobar could have involved sarin, saying that sarin victims would not have survived the lengthy journey to the hospital described by the newspaper.&lt;ref name=mcclatchy&gt;{{cite news |work=McClatchy DC |date=14 June 2013 |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/world/article24750067.html |title=Chemical weapons experts still skeptical about U.S. claim that Syria used sarin |first=Matthew |last=Schofield |accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, a doctor at the Islamic hospital in [[Hamouriyah|Hammuriya]] interviewed by ''Le Monde'' said that earlier in the day he had given an attack victim 15 shots of [[atropine]] and some hydrocortisone.&lt;ref name=LeMonde/&gt; While Zanders replied that the treatment could have killed the patient.&lt;ref name=mcclatchy /&gt;  

''Le Monde'' reported "injured fighters were lying beside five medical workers who had been contaminated by contact with the affected men" and that the hospital's director lost consciousness after working alongside casualties for an hour. The newspaper also said that "according to a well-informed Western source, the Syrian authorities have gone so far as to use mixtures of chemicals, notably with the addition of tear gas, to make it harder to identify the source of the symptoms."&lt;ref name=LeMonde/&gt;

==Investigations==
In June 2013, the French government told the United Nations that it had evidence of a [[sarin]] attack in Jobar between 12 and 14 April.&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt;{{rp|page=5}} After the August 21st [[Ghouta chemical attack]], French intelligence released a report that said samples from those attacks had confirmed the use of sarin.&lt;ref name=GuardianFrenchDossier&gt;{{cite web|first=Kim |last= Willsher|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/syria-crisis-french-intelligence-assad |title=Syria crisis: French intelligence dossier blames Assad for chemical attack |work=Guardian |date=2 September 2013 |accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gouvernement.fr/sites/default/files/fichiers_joints/syrie_synthese_nationale_de_renseignement_declassifie_02_09_2013.pdf |title=Synthèse nationale de renseignement déclassifié: Programme chimique syrien - Cas d’emploi passés d’agents chimiques par le régime Attaque chimique conduite par le régime le 21 août 2013 |format=PDF |date=3 September 2013 |accessdate=1 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110220306/http://www.gouvernement.fr/sites/default/files/fichiers_joints/syrie_synthese_nationale_de_renseignement_declassifie_02_09_2013.pdf |archivedate=10 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FrenchDossierEnglish&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/IMG/pdf/Syrian_Chemical_Programme.pdf |title=Syria/Syrian chemical programme – National executive summary of declassified intelligence |date=3 September 2013 |publisher=France-Diplomatie - Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United Nations Mission to Investigate Alleged Uses of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic|U.N. fact-finding mission]] which investigated the alleged attack did not receive "sufficient or credible information" to support the allegation.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite news|title=United Nations Mission on Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic|url=https://unoda-web.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/report.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2014|publisher=United Nations| location = | date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=10}}

'''John Margrave Lerew''', [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (20 August 1912&amp;nbsp;– 24&amp;nbsp;February 1996) was an officer and pilot in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) during World War&amp;nbsp;II, and later a senior manager in the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). As  commander of [[No. 24 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;24 Squadron]], based in [[New Britain]], he became famous in the annals of Air Force history for his irreverent response to orders by headquarters in Australia during the [[Battle of Rabaul (1942)|Battle of Rabaul]] in January 1942. After his squadron was directed to assist in repelling the invading Japanese fleet with its one serviceable bomber, and to keep its damaged airfield open, Lerew signalled headquarters with the ancient [[Latin]] phrase supposedly used by [[gladiator]]s honouring their [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]]: ''"[[Ave Imperator, morituri te salutant|Morituri vos salutamus]]"'' ("We who are about to die salute you"). He also defied an order to abandon his staff, and organised their escape from Rabaul.

In February 1942, Lerew led a low-level bombing raid on enemy shipping in [[New Guinea]] that set two vessels on fire. He was shot down but managed to evade capture, and returned to safety nine days after being reported missing. Awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], he subsequently commanded the RAAF's first flying safety directorate. After leaving the Air Force in 1946 as a [[group captain]], Lerew took up a position with the newly formed ICAO in Canada. He was responsible for several of its administrative and technical reforms, and rose to Chief of Flight Branch in 1969. Retiring from ICAO in 1972, he travelled extensively before settling in [[Vancouver]], where he died in 1996 at the age of eighty-three.

==Early life==
Born in [[Hamilton, Victoria|Hamilton]], Victoria, Lerew was the son of William Margrave Lerew, a chemist and veterinary surgeon who had emigrated from England with his two brothers. The family was of French ''[[Huguenot]]'' extraction, the original name being ''Le&amp;nbsp;Roux''.&lt;ref name="McAulay pp. 2-5"&gt;McAulay, pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt; John Lerew was educated at [[Scotch College, Melbourne]], where he was a member of the [[Australian Army Cadets|cadets]]. He studied part-time for a bachelor's degree in [[civil engineering]] at the [[University of Melbourne]], concurrently serving approximately two years in the [[Australian Military Forces|militia]] with various units including the [[39th Battalion (Australia)|39th&amp;nbsp;Battalion]], [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd&amp;nbsp;Division]] Artillery Survey Unit, and [[Melbourne University Regiment]].&lt;ref name="AWM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cas.awm.gov.au/heraldry/REL38851 |title=AWM Collection Record: REL38851 |publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]] |accessdate=22 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923195533/http://cas.awm.gov.au/heraldry/REL38851 |archivedate=23 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed a love of fast cars, joining a racing team and placing third in the 1930 [[Australian Grand Prix]].&lt;ref name="McAulay pp. 2-5"/&gt;

On 19&amp;nbsp;November 1932, Lerew enlisted as an air cadet in the RAAF active reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF).&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WW2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=R&amp;veteranId=1054249 |title=Lerew, John Margrave|work= World War W2 Nominal Roll |accessdate= 22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had marched into [[Victoria Barracks, Melbourne|Victoria Barracks]] on a whim and asked to see the person in charge of Air Force recruiting. He was shown to the office of Squadron Leader [[Raymond Brownell]], also a former Scotch College boy, who admitted him.&lt;ref name="McAulay pp. 2-5"/&gt; Lerew undertook flying instruction on the 1933 'B'&amp;nbsp;course conducted by [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|RAAF Station Laverton]],&lt;ref name="Third Brother"&gt;Coulthard-Clark, pp. 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; and was commissioned a [[pilot officer]] on 1&amp;nbsp;April.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt; He transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force on 20&amp;nbsp;May 1935, following graduation from university, and was promoted [[flying officer]] on 1&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;ref name="McAulay p. 10"&gt;McAulay, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Posted to [[No. 1 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot]], he was raised to probationary [[flight lieutenant]] in 1936. The rank became substantive the following year, when he was appointed Staff Officer Directorate of Works and Buildings at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, responsible for selection and improvement of airfield sites.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:AC0013Battle1940.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|alt=Single-engined three-seat military monoplane in flight, side-on|Fairey Battle photographed by Lerew from another Battle over Geelong, September 1940]]
Lerwe was still based in Melbourne when World War&amp;nbsp;II broke out in September 1939. He was promoted [[squadron leader]] in June 1940, and the same month took charge of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Aircraft Park in [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]]. One of his initial tasks was to test fly the first [[Fairey Battle]] single-engined light bomber assembled in Australia.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A22.htm |title=A22 Fairey Battle|publisher= [[RAAF Museum]]|accessdate= 22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was posted to [[No. 2 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Aircraft Depot]] at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales, in September 1940, and shortly afterwards undertook a survey of the [[Solomon Islands]] and the island of [[New Britain]], including its capital [[Rabaul]].&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Lerew was given command of [[No. 24 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;24 Squadron]] in May 1941, and raised to temporary [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] in October.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;

No.&amp;nbsp;24 Squadron's complement in November 1941 consisted of one Fairey Battle, three [[De Havilland Moth Minor]] biplane [[trainer (aircraft)|trainers]], five [[Lockheed Hudson]] twin-engined light bombers, and eleven [[CAC Wirraway]] monoplane trainers.&lt;ref name="Gillison p. 191"&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/09.pdf p. 191]&lt;/ref&gt; The two-seat Wirraways were expected to be employed in operations as [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]],&lt;ref name="Gamble pp. 58-59"&gt;Gamble, pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; but were suitable for such a role "only in the minds of the [[Air Board (Australia)|Air Board]]", in the words of RAAF historian Alan Stephens.&lt;ref name="Stephens pp. 135-136"&gt;Stephens, pp. 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; On 1&amp;nbsp;December, RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne put Lerew's squadron on notice for deployment to Rabaul as an advance garrison in the defence of northern Australia.&lt;ref name="Gillison p. 191"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephens pp. 135-136"/&gt;
{{Clear}}

===Preparations at Rabaul===
No.&amp;nbsp;24 Squadron's Hudsons began moving to [[Vunakanau]] airfield, Rabaul, from [[RAAF Base Townsville|RAAF Station Townsville]] in far-north [[Queensland]] on 5&amp;nbsp;December 1941. By the middle of the month they had been joined by the unit's Wirraways.&lt;ref name="Gillison p. 191"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillison p. 241"&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/11.pdf p. 241]&lt;/ref&gt; Vunakanau afforded little shelter for staff or aircraft, and Japanese [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] planes were already active in the vicinity, suggesting an attack was imminent.&lt;ref name="Gamble pp. 58-59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillison p. 241"/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;24 Squadron began carrying out reconnaissance missions with its Hudsons, and on one occasion attempted to bomb an enemy ship without success. RAAF Headquarters threatened to relieve Lerew for his apparent lack of results and delays in communications, and demanded to know his excuses. Possessed of what the [[Australia in the War of 1939–1945|official history]] of the RAAF in World War&amp;nbsp;II described as an "impish irreverence", Lerew listed among his reasons "disappointment in the lack of assistance rendered by the Almighty". He later reported that he was being caused "more worry" by his own headquarters in "the south than from the enemy situated in the north".&lt;ref name="Gillison pp. 269-271"&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/12.pdf pp. 269–271]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wirraway (AWM AC0141).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|alt=Single-engined two-seat military monoplane in flight, three-quarters overhead|Wirraway similar to those in No. 24 Squadron]]
No.&amp;nbsp;24 Squadron's strength at the beginning of 1942 was four Hudsons, six Wirraways, and 130&amp;nbsp;staff. On New Year's Day, Lerew led the Hudsons on a raid against [[Kapingamarangi|Kapingamarangi Island]], igniting a fuel dump that was still burning when the squadron returned to follow up the attack two days later.&lt;ref name="Gillison pp. 313-314"&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/15.pdf pp. 313–314]&lt;/ref&gt; During 4–7 January, Vunakanau airfield suffered four raids by unescorted Japanese bombers, destroying all but one of the Hudsons. Although the Wirraways were scrambled to intercept attackers on several occasions, their rate of climb was so poor that only once did one of them manage to engage an enemy [[seaplane]], without result; this action, on 6&amp;nbsp;January, was the first [[aerial warfare|air-to-air combat]] between RAAF and Japanese forces. At this point, Lerew signalled headquarters for six "modern fighters" with which to defend his airfield; none were forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, pp. 318–320&lt;/ref&gt;

Squadron Leader [[Tyndall#Australian Tindals|Arch Tindal]], [[Northern Area Command (RAAF)|Northern Area Command]] Armaments Officer, added his weight to Lerew's pleas for modern aircraft. Tindal had arrived to inspect No.&amp;nbsp;24 Squadron in the middle of an enemy attack on 3&amp;nbsp;January, and immediately leapt into the nearest Wirraway to attempt an interception. He later submitted a report to headquarters at Townsville, echoing Lerew's concerns regarding the Wirraway's capabilities and warning that "Rabaul is now wide open to bombing attack".&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, pp. 79, 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, morale remained high in the unit; Lerew remarked on the devil-may-care attitude of his personnel, who frequently waited until the last moment to take cover during air raids. On 17&amp;nbsp;January, Lerew was able to gain sufficient height in his Wirraway to confront a Japanese seaplane in a head-on attack, but his [[.303 British|.303]] machine-gun ammunition was not sufficient to bring it down. In 1956, while at a conference in Tokyo, he coincidentally met the Japanese plane's pilot, who informed him that his lone assault had damaged an engine and killed two crewmen, adding that Lerew was "the bravest enemy I ever faced".&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, pp. 103–106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invasion of Rabaul===
[[File:RabaulInvasionFleet1942.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=High-altitude overhead photo of fleet of ships in coastal waters|Japanese fleet to be employed in the invasion of Rabaul, photographed by an RAAF Hudson over [[Chuuk State|Truk]] on 9&amp;nbsp;January 1942]]
On 20&amp;nbsp;January, a force of over 100&amp;nbsp;Japanese aircraft, comprising bombers, dive bombers and fighter escort, converged on Rabaul.&lt;ref name="Stephens pp. 135-136"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillison pp. 354-355"&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/18.pdf pp. 354–355]&lt;/ref&gt; It was led by Commander [[Mitsuo Fuchida]], who had controlled the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7&amp;nbsp;December 1941.&lt;ref name="Gamble pp. 74-75"&gt;Gamble, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; Two patrolling Wirraways of No.&amp;nbsp;24 Squadron attacked the first wave of Japanese raiders. Lerew's six remaining Wirraways then scrambled, one crashing on take-off. Of the seven that were airborne, three were shot down into the sea by [[A6M Zero|Mitsubishi Zero]] fighters, two others crash landed with severe damage, one escaped with minor damage, and one remained unscathed. The ten-minute action killed six RAAF aircrew and wounded five.&lt;ref name="Gillison pp. 354-355"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gamble pp. 74-75"/&gt; An Australian soldier on the ground later recalled, "We sat at our guns, shocked by the massacre we had just observed".&lt;ref name="Gamble pp. 74-75"/&gt; The Japanese fighters compounded the humiliation by executing [[aerobatics]] over the bombed airfield.&lt;ref name="Stephens pp. 135-136"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Odgers"&gt;Odgers, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Lerew signalled headquarters, "Two Wirraways useless defence. Will you now please send some fighters?", receiving the reply, "Regret inability to supply fighters. If we had them you would get them."&lt;ref name="Gillison pp. 356-358"&gt;Gillison, pp. 356–358&lt;/ref&gt; The next day he was ordered to attack the approaching Japanese fleet with "all available aircraft". As his two serviceable Wirraways had no bomb racks, this left only the one remaining Hudson with which to execute the order; it duly took off to search for the enemy ships but was unable to locate them by nightfall, and returned to base.&lt;ref name="Stephens pp. 135-136"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gamble pp. 74-75"/&gt;

It was following a further directive from headquarters on 21&amp;nbsp;January 1942 to keep his airfield "open", that Lerew, after discussion with his intelligence staff, sent the signal that made him famous: ''"Morituri vos salutamus"''.&lt;ref name="Gamble pp. 74-75"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cas.awm.gov.au/heraldry/EXDOC168 |title=AWM Collection Record: EXDOC168 |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=22 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614220117/http://cas.awm.gov.au/heraldry/EXDOC168 |archivedate=14 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The message flummoxed headquarters, until an officer familiar with [[Latin]] decoded it as the legendary phrase used by ancient [[gladiator]]s to honour their [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]]: "We who are about to die salute you!"&lt;ref name="Gamble pp. 74-75"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Odgers"/&gt; Lerew also chose to ignore two other orders received from headquarters, firstly to turn his remaining ground staff and aircrew into infantrymen to assist with the army's defence and secondly to leave Rabaul in his remaining Hudson to take command of a new squadron in [[Port Moresby]], New Guinea. To the first order he replied that trained RAAF crews would be more valuable in future actions than in a last-ditch effort to repel the invader at Rabaul; to the second he simply turned a "blind eye", refusing to escape alone in the only aircraft left that could evacuate his personnel.&lt;ref name="Gillison pp. 356-358"/&gt; On 22&amp;nbsp;January, he sent off ninety-six staff in the Hudson and in [[flying boat]]s called in from Port Moresby.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Wilson, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt; Others escaped overland or in boats; Lerew's careful planning helped ensure that only three of his men were captured by the Japanese.&lt;ref name="Stephens pp. 135-136"/&gt;

===Later war service===
Following the evacuation of Rabaul, Lerew took command of a composite squadron in Port Moresby which later became [[No. 32 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;32 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; On 11&amp;nbsp;February 1942, he led a flight of three Hudsons in a raid on [[Gasmata]] harbour, making what the official history of the RAAF in World War&amp;nbsp;II described as "the first mast-height attack on enemy shipping in the [[New Guinea campaign]]". Having set two ships on fire, the Hudsons were attacked by enemy fighters and two were shot down, including Lerew's. With his aircraft in flames, he ordered his crew to bail out of the rear hatch while he parachuted from the front window. Lerew landed in the jungle and narrowly avoided capture before making his way to a [[Coastwatchers|Coastwatcher]] post and returning to Port Moresby in a [[schooner]], nine days after having been posted missing; his crew members had died.&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/23.pdf pp. 450–451]&lt;/ref&gt; On 7&amp;nbsp;April, Lerew was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for "outstanding courage, determination, skill and tenacity in the course of bombing raids on enemy positions in New Britain".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35518|date=7 April 1942|page=1593 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the Gasmata operation prompted the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] to commend Lerew's squadron for the "effort required by both crews and ground personnel owing to our small numbers and general condition".&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RAAF Hudson over Sydney Heads (AWM photo 128042).jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=Twin-engined twin-tailed military monoplane in flight, side-on|Hudson similar to those in Nos. 24 and 32 Squadrons]]
Returning to Australia, Lerew held various base commands including RAAF Station Townsville, [[HMAS Albatross (air station)|RAAF Station Nowra]] in New South Wales, and [[Batchelor Airfield]] near [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory. He led [[No. 7 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;7 Squadron]], operating [[Bristol Beaufort]]s out of first Nowra and then Townsville, from August to December 1942.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11031.asp|title= 7 Squadron RAAF|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate= 22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to RAAF Station Laverton to take charge of No.&amp;nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot (No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD). Lerew's biographer, Lex McAulay, speculated of this quick succession of postings across the country: "...it is easy to assume that this Wing Commander whose critical reports were seen by the War Cabinet, and who had twice escaped the enemy at close quarters, was not to be allowed personal contact with the media of the day until his experiences were no longer topical and were overtaken by more recent momentous events".&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Though degree-qualified in civil engineering, Lerew believed he was underused in the technical environment of No.&amp;nbsp;1 AD, and sought another overseas posting. Nevertheless, his tenure at Laverton helped prepare him for his later flying safety work. In September 1943, he investigated the crash of a [[Vultee A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] flown by an experienced aviator, and found that when rolling the aircraft to the right it was possible for the pilot's movements to release his safety harness, making it impossible for him to remain in his seat and control the aircraft. Lerew designed and developed a clip to prevent a recurrence of this mishap, which was later adopted worldwide for all such harnesses.&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, pp. 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;

Lerew was posted to RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, in December 1943. He travelled via the United States, meeting film stars [[Bing Crosby]], [[Bob Hope]], and [[Dorothy Lamour]] on the set of ''[[Road to Utopia]]'' at [[Los Angeles]] in February 1944.&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, pp. 221, 226&lt;/ref&gt; In London, he undertook study of RAF and USAAF methods of operations, as well as diplomatic duties. Of the [[Operation Overlord|invasion of France]] on 6&amp;nbsp;June 1944, he wrote: "There has been no rejoicing. A hushed quietness has descended over London and all of England. Most people have relatives in it, and there is only one wish: that is, that it will end quickly. It is depressing to be playing no part in it."&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, Lerew was [[Investiture|invested]] with his Distinguished Flying Cross by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George&amp;nbsp;VI]] at [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt; He returned to Australia in early 1945, and married Laurie Steele, the Australian-born widow of a [[Royal Air Force]] [[night-fighter]] pilot, having met her when he was stationed in England. The couple had two daughters, but eventually divorced.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt; In March, Lerew took part in the investigation into the crash of a Hudson carrying Major General [[George Alan Vasey|George Vasey]]; he determined that the pilot's lack of experience in instrument flying had been a factor, and recommended further such training for RAAF flight crew.&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted group captain, he formed the Directorate of Flying Safety in June 1945 and served as its inaugural Director.&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that the promotion of flying safety in the RAAF cut across both administrative and operational spheres, and aware of the [[George Jones (RAAF officer)#Divided command|notorious feud]] between the service's two senior officers, Air Vice Marshals [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]] and [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]], Lerew had proposed that the new directorate be placed squarely under the auspices of Jones as Chief of the Air Staff, with authority to demand free access to information from all other directorates.&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, pp. 241–244&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career and later life==
[[File:Lerew1945.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=Half-length portrait of moustachioed man in military battle jacket, with aviator's wings on left breast pocket and four stripes on shoulders|Lerew c. 1945–46]]
Dubious about the prospects for advancement in the post-war military, Lerew applied for a role in the recently established Provisional [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (PICAO) in March 1946, while still Director of Flying Safety in the RAAF. He had just been appointed [[Air Officer Commanding]] [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area]] in Darwin on 7&amp;nbsp;October 1946 when PICAO offered him the position of Technical Officer, which he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, pp. 253–255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McAulay p. 313"&gt;McAulay, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; He left the RAAF on 8&amp;nbsp;November 1946,&lt;ref name="WW2"/&gt; emigrating to [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, to take up his new employment with PICAO, which became ICAO in 1947.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt; Appointed Chief of Aerodromes, Air Routes and Ground Aids Section in January 1951,&lt;ref name="McAulay p. 313"/&gt; he conducted assessments of airfields throughout the world, and led the team that recommended [[Ellinikon International Airport|Hellinikon]] be developed as Athens' international airport.&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; Lerew received credit for several of ICAO's accomplishments over the next decade, including various administrative reforms within the organisation and finalising a standard runway approach lighting system in 1953 following five years of disagreement among members.&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, pp. 305–306&lt;/ref&gt; A colleague remembered him as having "that very fortunate duality of personality, being serious, efficient and knowledgeable in his official capacity, with an equally inherent twin ability to really liven things up off-duty".&lt;ref&gt;McAulay, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico on 20&amp;nbsp;August 1966, Lerew married Josephine Henriette Oude Reimerink, a Dutch national he had met three years earlier.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt; He was promoted ICAO's Chief of Flight Branch in April 1969, in which capacity he served until retiring from the organisation in 1972.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McAulay p. 313"/&gt; In retirement, Lerew and his wife restored houses and travelled extensively.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt; Their expeditions resulted in two narrow escapes, in December 1974 when they tired of the oppressively humid weather in Darwin and left just before [[Cyclone Tracy]] struck on [[Christmas Day]], and in February 1976 when they decided to camp well away from [[Lago de Atitlán|Lake Atitlan]], Guatemala, which was devastated soon after by an [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|earthquake that left over 22,000 people dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last = Troniak|first = Rose Marie|title = Memories of Josephine H.

'''Kentucky Fried Cruelty''' is a [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) campaign that began in 2001, and seeks to change [[KFC]]'s (also known as "Kentucky Fried Chicken") treatment of the chickens that are raised for its restaurants. According to PETA, since the launch of the campaign in 2003, more than 12,000 protests against KFC have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Campaign Highlights|url=http://www.kentuckyfriedcruelty.com/h-campaign.asp|work=Kentucky Fried Cruelty|publisher=PETA|accessdate=15 December 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; KFC is the fourth [[fast food]] restaurant chain targeted by PETA, following campaigns against [[McDonald's]], [[Burger King]], and [[Wendy's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PETA and KFC|url=http://www.kentuckyfriedcruelty.com/h-timeline.asp|work=Kentucky Fried Cruelty|publisher=PETA|accessdate=15 December 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:KFC.comlicense.jpg|right|thumb|160px|KentuckyFriedCruelty.com's driver's license.]] --&gt;
"KentuckyFriedCruelty.com" was the [[legal name]] of Christopher Garnett, a youth outreach worker for PETA, after he changed his name to protest the treatment of chickens by KFC.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|title=PETA staffer legally changes name to KentuckyFriedCruelty.com|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-12-30-peta-staffer_x.htm|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=30 December 2005|author=Adrian Wyld}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his name change, Garnett was the [[street team]] coordinator of peta2, PETA's youth division.

The PETA website showed a copy of KentuckyFriedCruelty.com's drivers license bearing what was his legal name.&lt;ref name=PETAsite&gt;[http://www.kentuckyfriedcruelty.com/whatsinaname.asp "What's in a name?"], PETA, retrieved July 12, 2006.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415014949/http://www.kentuckyfriedcruelty.com/whatsinaname.asp |date=April 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PETA member [[Pamela Anderson]] expressed her support for the name change, as did his parents, although they continued to call him "Chris". Garnett explained in a January 2006 interview with [[Tucker Carlson]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Pretty much everyone still calls me Chris, some of the people at the office call me Ken or Tuck.  But the funny thing about the name change is, regardless of what people call me, every time I go to pay for something, I show someone my ID, I'm able to tell them about how KFC is, you know, cutting the beaks off baby birds and how their workers are slamming chickens in a wall, kicking them like footballs and laughing about it.  And people are pretty shocked to hear about this sort of thing.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite news|title='The Situation with Tucker Carlson' for January 18|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/10924505/|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=NBC News|date=19 January 2006|author=Tucker Carlson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Garnett promised his mother he would revert the name change after KFC ceased its "worst abuses" against its chickens;&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt; however, following Garnett's official return to his birth name in August 2006, he explained that difficulties encountered when applying for a passport and credit card were the [[wikt:impetus|impetus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PETA activists go back to given names|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-08-15-peta-web-names_x.htm|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=15 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[friendly fire]] incidents by the [[United States|U.S. Military]] on allied British personnel and civilians. The topic has become prevalent in British culture due to some recent incidents, and is often satirically portrayed in the media.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

'''MOSAIC threat assessment systems (MOSAIC)''' is a method developed by [[Gavin de Becker and Associates]] in the early 1980s to assess and screen [[threats]] and inappropriate communications.

Walt Risler of [[Indiana University]] assisted in the early development of the method, and Robert Martin, founding commander of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] Threat Management Unit played a role in later development and enhancements. (Martin now heads up the MOSAIC threat assessment Unit at Gavin de Becker &amp; Associates.)

The first MOSAIC systems were developed before 1992. The computer-assisted MOSAIC method is now used by the [[Supreme Court Police]] to assess threats to the Justices, by the [[U.S. Capitol Police]] for threats against Members of [[United States Congress|Congress]], by police agencies protecting the governors of eleven states, by many large corporations, and by more than twenty top universities.

There are different MOSAIC systems for different situations, including:

* Threats and fear in the workplace
* Threats by students
* Threats against judges and other judicial officials
* Threats against public figures and public officials
* Domestic abuse situations

The MOSAIC method poses a series of questions to users, accompanied by a range of possible answers.  For every area of inquiry, the system provides a button for “Premise of the Question” – providing immediate on-screen research citations about why that particular area of inquiry is part of the assessment process.  MOSAIC calculates the value of the answers selected by the assessor, and expresses the results on a scale of 1 to 10.  Unlike most assessment tools, many of which are paper checklists, MOSAIC automatically produces a full written report, describing the factors that were considered and the selections made by the user.

MOSAIC’s on-line resources include a library of research, publications, and training videos that users can access during an assessment.

==Types of MOSAIC==

===MOSAIC – public figures (MAPP)===
MOSAIC for assessing unwanted pursuit of public figures (MAPP) is used by agencies protecting elected and appointed officials, national security agencies, and iconic public figures.

Lieutenant Tom Taylor, four-time president of the National Governor’s Security Association, wrote for the Institute of Police Technology and Management:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The consistent way in which MOSAIC methodically guides an evaluation and documents the findings is what sets it apart. In fact, since it places less emphasis on the presence (or lack) of a direct threat, as well as any denials of intent that are uttered in an interview, MOSAIC forces the investigator to look at all of the factors present in the situation.&lt;ref name="dodgingbullets"&gt;Taylor, Tom.  (2000).  Dodging Bullets: A Strategic Guide to World-Class Protection.  [http://www.iptm.org/ Institute of Police Technology and Management].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===MOSAIC – judicial officials (MAJ)===
In the mid-nineties, Ted Calhoun of the [[United States Marshals Service]] undertook a research project about threats and attacks on federal judges. He studied and analyzed more than 3,000 cases of threats against Federal judges and prosecutors. Calhoun felt that these threats – often made by people whose lives were directly affected by the court – were inherently different from threats to other public figures, with whom the threateners rarely had any real contact.

The marshal's service selected the MOSAIC method for applying Calhoun’s research, and Gavin de Becker &amp; Associates was commissioned to co-develop a new system: MOSAIC for Assessment of Threats to Judges (MAJ).

The book ''Hunters and Howlers: Threats &amp; Violence Against Federal Judicial Officials'' describes the method that evolved into this MOSAIC:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
By drawing as complete a mosaic of the threatened and each of his inappropriate communications as possible, de Becker’s system identifies those situations requiring a defensive reaction or a proactive response.  The problem is thus managed to the best and least intrusive protection of the victim. The whole approach is informed by an intelligent, comprehensive process of thinking. De Becker’s assessments are the best because he asks the most comprehensive questions, and he consistently asks them of every communication. To do fewer risks more.&lt;ref name="hunters"&gt;Calhoun, Frederick S. (February 1998).  Hunters and Howlers: Threats and Violence Against Federal Judicial Officials in the United States.  ''[[United States Marshals Service]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A variation of MAJ is now used by Sheriff’s Deputies, bailiffs, and others tasked to protect judges and other judicial officials.

===MOSAIC – domestic violence (DV-MOSAIC)===
DV - MOSAIC assesses situations involving domestic violence.  As of April 2010, DV - MOSAIC is available at no-cost to the public at [http://www.mosaicmethod.com www.mosaicmethod.com].

A study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice and published by the National Criminal Justice Reference Service found that when compared to two specific instruments, the Domestic Violence Screening Instrument (DSVI) and the Kingston Screening Instrument for Domestic Violence (K-SID), DV - MOSAIC “performed best in predicting subsequent stalking or threats.”  The study also reported that MOSAIC tested highest on “sensitivity,” correctly classifying most of the women that were re-assaulted; had the strongest correlation between the victims’ perception of risk of re-assault and risk of serious harm; captured relevant information equally well with victims of various ethnicities; had scores that were significantly associated with abuse; and provided uniformity of assessment (called Inter-rater Reliability) such that ten different people of different abilities and styles would come up with the same preliminary rating.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;Roehl, Janice Ph.D.; O’Sullivan, Chris Ph.D.; Webster, Daniel ScD; and Campbell Jacquelyn, Ph.D.  (May 2005).  [https://www.mosaicmethod.com/documents/DOJ_Study.pdf Intimate Partner Violence Risk Assessment Validation Study].  ''[[U.S. Department of Justice]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A synopsis of the findings is available at https://www.mosaicmethod.com/documents/DOJ_Study.pdf.

The study has also been published by the University of Wisconsin-Madison,&lt;ref name="Wisconsin"&gt;University of Wisconsin - Madison Libraries [http://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/ocn789282109]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Journal of Interpersonal Violence,&lt;ref name="Violence"&gt;The Journal of Interpersonal Violence [http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/28/7/1537.abstract]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations Entity for Gender Equity,&lt;ref name="Gender Equity"&gt;United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women [http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/1088-risk-assessment.html]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Violence Against Women Network.&lt;ref name= "Violence Women"&gt;The Violence Against Women Network. [http://www.vawnet.org/special-collections/DVHomicide.php]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

DV-MOSAIC is used by many police departments around the nation.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;Johnson, Tracy.  (October 21, 1996).  Software Assess the Likelihood of Violence in Home. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“MOSAIC is proving successful. In the suburbs of Los Angeles where it is used, officials attribute much of the 70% decline in domestic violence to the system.&lt;ref name="LA"&gt;ABC NEWS/Discovery [http://gavindebecker.com/files/careers/MOSAIC_SRG.pdf]''.&lt;/ref&gt;"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Robert Ressler]], a criminologist who worked in the FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit for 16 years, has referred federal agencies to de Becker. “It has a futuristic ability to predict crime and has a proven track record," Ressler said. "You can predict a crime and deal with a potential situation based on a reading from a database. It will help law enforcement deal with situations successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-21/local/me-56247_1_domestic-violence |title=Software Assesses Likelihood of Violence in Home |publisher=Los Angeles Times |first=Tracy |last=Johnson |date=October 21, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

===MOSAIC – workplace violence (MAT-W)===
MOSAIC – workplace violence assesses the three most likely sources of violence in the workplace: angry employees, angry former employees, and stalkers who pursue their targets at the workplace.

The development of this MOSAIC was guided by an Advisory Board of experts and practitioners from industry, government, and law enforcement.

This version of MOSAIC is used by professionals in security departments, legal departments, and human resources offices of large organizations, government agencies, and universities.

===MOSAIC for assessment of threats by students (MAST)===
The development of MOSAIC for threats by students (MAST) included an exploration into the pre-incident indicators of explosive school violence.  The process drew on more than two hundred experts and practitioners from the fields of education, counseling, psychology, parenting, [[threat assessment]], law enforcement, the judiciary, and students.

The MAST is used by school administrators, counselors, and security/law enforcement officers.

In 1997, Chief James Perrotti of the [[Yale University]] police stated that the department used MOSAIC for assessing threats made to Yale professors. He stated that MOSAIC allowed police to prioritize cases and better allocate their resources.&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;Sachsman, Susanne (September 8, 1997). Prof Stalkers Beware: MOSAIC is here.  ''[Yale News]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Missouri Campus Task Force report to the Governor of Missouri on campus security and violence prevention included the recommendation that “Each institution should thoroughly evaluate the viability and appropriateness of using assessment tools (e.g. MOSAIC) designed to identify individuals with the potential for violent behavior.&lt;ref name="missouri"&gt;Missouri Campus Task Force.  (August 21, 2007).  [https://www.mosaicmethod.com/documents/missouri_report.pdf Security Our Future: Making Colleges and Universities Safe Places to Learn and Grow].  Missouri Department of Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt;"

The Superintendent of the L.A. County Office of Education said about MOSAIC: “This is not something where I call you in and give you the third degree. I give myself the third degree because parents want to know why. It just can't be, ‘I don't like your child, I don't like what he does, and I can't explain why.’ This is bringing us to a higher level.&lt;ref name="Dr. Don"&gt;Dr. Don Ingwerson, Superintendent of the L.A. County Office of Education [http://gavindebecker.com/files/careers/MOSAIC_SRG.pdf]''.&lt;/ref&gt;"

==The Oprah Winfrey Show==
In April 2010, [[Oprah Winfrey]] dedicated an hour-long show to applying the MOSAIC method to domestic violence situations. It was announced on the show that Gavin de Becker was making MOSAIC available to anyone at no cost.  Tens of thousands of audience members accessed MOSAIC within the first two weeks, and this MOSAIC remains available to anyone today at no cost at [http://www.oprah.com www.oprah.com] or [http://www.mosaicmethod.com www.mosaicmethod.com].&lt;ref name="oprah"&gt;[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]] (April 16, 2010). [[Gavin de Becker]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy about MOSAIC==
In an article on the method, psychologist Hill Walker, a professor at the University of Oregon who had studied behavioral disorders in schoolchildren for 34 years told Wired Magazine, "There are some serious validity issues here, some reputation-ruining implications.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;Forrest, Brett (June 2000). [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.06/mustread.html?pg=5 UltraViolencePredictor 1.0.] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''&lt;/ref&gt;" The developers note that Hill Walker has never seen or used a MOSAIC system, and was commenting on the idea or concept, not the actual method. In a letter to the editor following publication of the article, de Becker wrote that MOSAIC for Assessment of Student Threats (MAST) “is the opposite of profiling in that it is always applied to an actual known individual, and it always explores actual behavior and circumstance.&lt;ref name="debecker"&gt;de Becker, Gavin (September 2000). [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.09/rants.html Rants &amp; Raves.] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In an editorial, Professor [[Laurence Steinberg]] (who had never seen MOSAIC) questioned the value of the method for predicting violence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In a nation of 90,000 schools, trying to pick out the dozen or so students a year who might commit murder is like looking for a needle in a haystack the size of Kansas 
.&lt;ref name="NYTSteinberg"&gt;Steinberg, Laurence.  (April 22, 2000).  Software Can't Make School Safe. ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

De Becker responded that MOSAIC for Assessment of Student Threats (MAST) is never applied to the general population of students, and rather just to those students who self-identify by making a threat.&lt;ref name="de Becker"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/05/opinion/l-threats-in-school-103098.html |title=Threats in School |publisher=New York Times |first=Gavin |last=de Becker |date=May 5, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NY Times published a letter by de Becker, commenting on Professor Steinberg's editorial.&lt;ref name="de Becker"/&gt;

==Additional Information and Comments Regarding MOSAIC==
* In 2007, the London Times reported that the city of Croyden had adopted the DV-MOSAIC model in conjunction with the co-located services approach developed by the Family Justice Center in San Diego.&lt;ref name="London"&gt;The London Times (2007) [http://themaddiecasefiles.com/topic2188.html]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2001, an article in Sheriff Magazine by Dr. Frederick Calhoun stated: “Although originally designed for assessing threats to Federal judicial officials, MOSAIC's assessments are relevant to all aspects of the judicial setting.&lt;ref name="Calhoun"&gt;Sheriff Magazine (2001) [https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=189301]''.&lt;/ref&gt;"
* In 2000, officials from the CIA, Yale University Police Department, the U.S. Capitol Police, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the U.S. Marshals Service, the California Highway Patrol, and other experts participated in a comprehensive review of the MOSAIC used for assessment of threats to public figures, and an updated system emerged, now known as the MOSAIC for Assessment of Public-figure Pursuit (MAPP).
* In 2000, the State of California convened a group of experts to study the domestic violence MOSAIC, and suggested changes and enhancements. This led to the development of a special MOSAIC called CAL-MOSAIC which the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) provided at no cost to each of the State’s 600+ police departments.&lt;ref name="POST"&gt;''Commission on Peace Officers Standards and Training''[http://post.ca.gov/]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1999, the Los Angeles and Chicago school districts participated in a project to develop a MOSAIC specially designed for assessing threats made by students.  Paul Vallas, Superintendent of Chicago Schools, said at a press conference, "Our schools need to avoid overreacting to threats that aren't substantial, and this system can help them in this respect. We can't be afraid of new technology, we can't be afraid of new approaches. Violence is a fact of life across this country, and we need to equip our principals with the analytical tools to make accurate calls as to which services and intervention support to make available to their students.&lt;ref name="Vallas"&gt;Paul Vallas, Superintendent of Chicago Schools [http://gavindebecker.com/files/careers/MOSAIC_SRG.pdf]''.&lt;/ref&gt;"
* In 1998, MOSAIC was selected by the National Victim Center as one of the “Top Ten Most Promising Strategies and Practices in Using Technology to Benefit Victims.”
* U.S. Attorney General Meese and FBI Director Webster presented a special award to Gavin de Becker for “Outstanding work in developing a [[threat assessment]] model that has been of great assistance to law enforcement and criminal justice agencies.&lt;ref name="Award"&gt;U.S Attorney General Meese &amp; FBI Director Webster  [http://gavindebecker.com/files/careers/MOSAIC_SRG.pdf]''.&lt;/ref&gt;"
* Los Angeles County Law enforcement agencies adopted MOSAIC in 1997 to help police manage and reduce spousal abuse cases that might escalate to homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-02-05/local/me-25642_1_domestic-violence |title= Software Aids Battle Against Home Violence |publisher=Los Angeles Times |first=Julie |last=Tamaki |date=February 5, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matchroom Sport logo.gif|200px|right]]
'''Matchroom Sport''' is a sport event promotions company led by the founder and owner [[English people|English]] [[entrepreneur]] [[Barry Hearn]] and his son [[Eddie Hearn|Eddie]]. It first came to attention in the sports of [[snooker]] and [[boxing]] and is also involved in [[pocket billiards|pool]], [[bowling]], [[golf]] (see [[PGA EuroPro Tour]]), [[fishing]], [[darts]], [[Table Tennis]], and [[poker]] and as of late 2016 [[gymnastics]]. The company is based in [[Brentwood, Essex]].&lt;ref name="CheckSure"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matchroom has a comprehensive broadcasting agreement in the United Kingdom with [[Sky Sports]].

Recently, it also began sponsoring the football ground of English League Two team [[Leyton Orient]]. Previously called Brisbane Road, it has now been renamed the [[Matchroom Stadium]]. [[Barry Hearn]] used to be Orient's [[Chairman]].

==Cue sports==
Matchroom Sport entered snooker event management in the 1980s. They had players such as Steve Davis, Dennis Taylor and Jimmy White on their books.

Matchroom Sport is currently the official sponsor of the annual [[WPA World Nine-ball Championship]], the most prestigious professional tournament of its field. After having organised a similar but competing event for one year, the World Professional Pool Championship in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]], in July 1999, Matchroom merged its tournament with that of the [[World Pool-Billiard Association]] in 2000, and the joint event took the promotional name "[[WPA World Nine-ball Championship|World Pool Championship]]" (an ambiguous name, since there is also a yearly [[WPA World Eight-ball Championship]] held in the [[United Arab Emirates]]). The event stayed in Cardiff until 2003, with the 2004 and 2005 events taking place in [[Taiwan]]. [[2006 WPA Men's World Nine-ball Championship|The 2006 event]] was held in the [[Philippines]]. Despite the moves, the competition has remained very similar in format and staging throughout.

Matchroom's other prestigious pool event is the [[Mosconi Cup]], held each December from 1994 onwards. The event is modelled on the [[Ryder Cup]], and it pits a team of [[Europe]]an players against a team from the [[United States|US]]. From 2003, the event has alternated between European and American venues, having previous always been held in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

The Mosconi Cup is notable for having evolved from an [[exhibition game|exhibition]] event in the early years, into a genuinely prestigious tournament. Early Mosconi Cup contests were characterised by a team of some of America’s most [[charisma]]tic players taking on a European team of mainly [[British people|British]] [[snooker]] players, in an attempt to promote [[nine-ball]] in the UK. More recent instances of the event have been fought in a much more serious manner, although the raucous crowd atmosphere has been retained, making it unique among [[cue sports]] competitions.

==Ten-pin bowling==
Matchroom has been involved in a revival of the sport of [[ten-pin bowling]] which has given the sport a renewed international [[pop culture|pop-culture]] interest.

{{coord|41|03|44region:US_type:landmark|display=title}}
The '''Montauk Project''' is a conspiracy theory that alleges there were a series of secret [[United States]] government projects conducted at [[Camp Hero State Park|Camp Hero]] or [[Montauk Air Force Station]] on [[Montauk, New York|Montauk]], [[Long Island]], for the purpose of developing [[psychological warfare]] techniques and exotic research including [[time travel]]. The story of the Montauk Project originated in [[The Montauk Project: Experiments in Time|the ''Montauk Project'' series of books]] by [[Preston Nichols]] which intermixes those stories with stories about the [[Philadelphia Experiment]].&lt;ref name="scientificexploration.or"&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink= Jacques Vallée |last= Vallée |first= Jacques F. |year= 1994 |title= Anatomy of a hoax: The Philadelphia Experiment fifty years later |journal= Journal of Scientific Exploration |volume= 8 |issue= 1 |pages= 47–71 |access-date= January 13, 2010 |url= http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_08_1_vallee.pdf |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091222023540/http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_08_1_vallee.pdf |archivedate= December 22, 2009 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frissell2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frissell|first=Bob|title=Something in This Book Is True, Second Edition: The Official Companion to Nothing in this Book Is True, But It's Exactly How Things Are|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hoU3m8T0IukC&amp;pg=PA76 |access-date=May 27, 2011|date=April 25, 2003 |publisher=Frog Books|isbn=978-1-58394-077-8|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Stories about the Montauk Project have circulated since the early 1980s. According to UFO researcher Jacques Vallée, the Montauk Experiment stories seem to have originated with the account of Preston Nichols, who claimed to have recovered [[repressed memory|repressed memories]] of his own involvement and claims that he is periodically abducted to continue his participation against his will.&lt;ref name="bibliotecapleyades"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/montauk/esp_montauk_1.htm |title=Preston Nichols |publisher=bibliotecapleyades.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scientificexploration.or" /&gt;  Nichols, born May 24, 1946 on Long Island, New York, claims to have degrees in [[parapsychology]], psychology, and electrical engineering,&lt;ref&gt;The Montauk Project: Experiments in Time, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; and he has authored a series of books, known as the ''Montauk Project'' series, along with Peter Moon, the primary topic of which is alleged activities at Montauk.  These center on topics including United States government/military experiments in fields such as time travel, teleportation, mind control, contact with alien life and staging [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|faked Apollo Moon landings]], framed as developments which followed a successful 1943 Philadelphia Experiment.  These culminate in "a hole ripped in space-time" in 1983.

The authors have encouraged speculation about the contents; for example, they wrote, "Whether you read this as science fiction or non-fiction you are in for an amazing story" in their first chapter,{{fact|date=August 2018}} describing much of the content as "soft facts" in a ''Guide For Readers'' and publishing a newsletter with updates to the story.

The work has been characterized as fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fictiondb.com/author/preston-b-nichols~montauk-revisited-adventures-in-synchronicity~314888~b.htm |title=Montauk Revisited: Adventures in Synchronicity |first=Preston B. |last=Nichols |publisher=FictionDB}} Categorises Nichols's work as "speculative fiction" and "science fiction".&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media {{anchor|Film}}==
In 2015 ''[[Montauk Chronicles]]'', a film adaptation of the conspiracy featuring Preston Nichols, Al Bielik, and Stewart Swerdlow, was released online and on DVD and Blu-ray. The film won the best documentary award at the [[Philip K. Dick|Philip K.

The [[Netflix]] TV series ''[[Stranger Things]]'' was allegedly inspired by the Montauk Project, and at one time ''Montauk'' was used as its [[working title]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencealert.com/there-s-a-crazy-government-conspiracy-theory-that-inspired-stranger-things |first=Jason |last=Guerrasio |title=This Is The Crazy Government Conspiracy Theory That Inspired 'Stranger Things' |website=sciencealert.com |date=September 20, 2016 |access-date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/stranger-inspired-secret-government-experiments-article-1.2774525 |first=Jessica |last=Schladebeck |title=A look at ‘Stranger Things’ and the secret government experiments that inspired it |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=September 1, 2016 |access-date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slashfilm"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Anderton |first1=Ethan |title='Stranger Things' Was Inspired By a Creepy, Supposedly Real Experiment Called The Montauk Project |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/stranger-things-inspired-by-the-montauk-project/ |website=[[/Film]] |date=September 6, 2016 |access-date=September 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=WIRED|title=Stranger Things Cast Answer the Web's Most Searched Questions {{!}} WIRED|date=2017-11-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EvMYEfF_hQ|accessdate=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montauk story also features prominently in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s 2013 novel ''[[Bleeding Edge]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3164">'''Mopery''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|p|ə|r|i}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|mopery}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a vague, informal name for minor offenses. The word is based on the verb ''to [[wiktionary:mope|mope]]'', which originally meant “to wander aimlessly”; it only later acquired the sense "to be bored and depressed". The word ''mope'' appears to have first been used in the 16th century, and appears in [[Shakespeare]]'s works. It has occasionally been put into use by police as a charge to bring when no other legitimate charge seems appropriate. It has also been used for satiric and/or comedic effect in books and films.

== Definitions ==
In 1970, in [[Columbus, Ohio]], US, mopery was defined as “[[loitering]] while walking, or walking down the street with no clear destination or purpose”, and was used by police to stop and interview [[counterculture]] "hippies" who were regarded as unsavory.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Some of those arrested were aggressively prosecuted by public prosecutor [[Karl T. Chrastan]]. In discussions of law, ''mopery'' is used as a [[placeholder name]] to mean some crime whose nature is not important to the problem at hand. This is sometimes expanded to "mopery with intent to creep" or "mopery with intent to gawk". The first person to be arrested for this crime was Matthew J. Frisch, a minor from Edgewood, Kentucky, who claimed he was simply "dazed and confused." His arrester, Officer Terry Chinn, was so appalled by this action that he was driven insane and eventually murdered twenty-three (23) children in a span of three (3) days with nothing more than his hands and a bottle of Mrs. Butterworth's maple syrup.

The word ''mopery'' has been used by authors [[Thomas Pynchon]] ''([[Gravity's Rainbow]])'' and [[Dashiell Hammett]] ''([[The Thin Man]])'', among others, for whom it is usually a comic accent. In ''[[Catch-22]]'' ([[Joseph Heller]], 1961), the mildly rebellious Cadet Clevinger is [[court-martial]]ed by three angry officers, who accuse him of “breaking ranks while in formation, felonious assault, indiscriminate behavior, mopery, [[high treason]], provoking, being a [[wikt:smart aleck|smart-guy]], listening to [[classical music]], and so on”. Similarly, in the 1984 comedy film, ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]'', mopery is defined as "exposing oneself to a blind person."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0013355/quotes Dudley "Booger" Dawson quotes] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;   According to [[Russell Baker]], "mopery isn't a crime, but only an old policemen's joke in which it's defined as the act of displaying yourself in the nude to a blind person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Kissing and Telling About Kiss-and-Tell |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/05/magazine/on-language-kissing-and-telling-about-kiss-and-tell.html| work= [[On Language]] | date= June 5, 1988 | first= William|last= Safire | authorlink=William Safire | publisher= The New York Times| accessdate= 2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mountain Cheese Olympics''' are a festival held in [[Appenzell]], [[Switzerland]], intended to promote the economic interests of mountain regions, focusing on [[cheese]] because "mountain cheese" is considered to have separate qualities from other kinds of cheese. Mountain cheeses are most often made from sheep or goat milk, and tend to be softer.

Though it was started primarily by Switzerland, [[France]], and [[Italy]], who also happen to dominate its awards, there are typically over 100 entries, from all over the world, including [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], and [[Ethiopia]].

One of the upset winners in 2004 was [[Sakura cheese]], from the [[Hokkaidō]] region of [[Japan]], a soft cheese flavored with mountain cherry leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-10-31/japan-wins-swiss-cheese-prize/576752|title=Japan wins Swiss cheese prize|date=31 October 2004|website=abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brianna Zunino Denison''' (March 29, 1988 – January 20, 2008) was a college student from [[Santa Barbara, California]] who was abducted on January 20, 2008 from a friend's house in [[Reno, Nevada]]. Her body was discovered on February 15, 2008 in a field near a Reno business park after being raped and murdered. A man named '''James Biela''' was convicted of the murder.

==Background==
Brianna attended [[Reno High School]] in Reno, Nevada. She graduated from Reno in June 2006. Denison was at home during winter break from [[Santa Barbara City College]], where she was studying psychology. She and her friends had attended events tied to a Summer Winter Action Tours LLC (a travel agency that caters to students), [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] weekend in Reno; Denison had reportedly attended this event in the past.&lt;ref name="disappeared3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/Story?id=4172264&amp;page=2 | title = FBI Joins Search for 'Abducted' Teen | publisher = ABCNews.com | date = January 22, 2008 | accessdate = February 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brianna was last seen alive on January 20, 2008 at approximately 4:00 am [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]] at her friend's house near the University of Nevada campus. This residence is on MacKay Court, Reno, where she was staying after attending a party at the [[Sands Regency]] on North Arlington Avenue.&lt;ref name="disappeared"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,324794,00.html | title = FBI Joins Search for Missing Nevada Woman; Police Suspect Abduction | publisher = FoxNews.com | date = January 23, 2008 | accessdate = February 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her friend K.T. Hunter woke up at around 9:00 am and could not find Denison. A small blood stain was found on the pillow Denison used to sleep with that night, which led her friend to alert Brianna's parents and subsequently local authorities. Denison had left the house without her shoes, cell phone, or purse. Authorities believed she was wearing only sweats and a white tank top. She was later found to have been dressed in only bright orange-colored socks. &lt;ref name="disappeared2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=4172264&amp;page=1 | title = FBI Joins Search for 'Abducted' Teen | publisher = ABCNews.com | date = January 22, 2008 | accessdate = February 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.rgj.com/story/news/crime/2016/06/08/2010-taken-friends-house-her-body-left-empty-field/85601682/&lt;/url&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the following days, the Reno Police Department conducted a forensic investigation of the MacKay Court residence where Brianna was staying when she was abducted and found [[touch DNA]] belonging to an unidentified male on the doorknob&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mikkilineni|first=Rupa|title=Tip line played key role in cracking cold case|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/12/02/cold.case.arrest/index.html?eref=ib_topstories|newspaper=CNN|date=December 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also discovered that the blood on the pillow was Denison's. Investigators began focusing on a kidnapping scenario.&lt;ref name="disappeared"/&gt;

=== Search ===
On January 21, 2008 investigators began sweeping the [[University of Nevada, Reno]] area in search of Denison. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) also joined in the search efforts.&lt;ref name="disappeared3" /&gt; Investigators later learned that the male DNA found on the couch where Denison was sleeping the night when she disappeared was linked with at least 2 previous sexually motivated attacks in the same area on November 13{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} and December 16, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/2192218-181/sparks-construction-worker-accused-of|title=Sparks construction worker accused of raping, killing former Mendocino resident|date=December 12, 2008|publisher=[[The Press Democrat]]|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2008, a Reno woman stated that she knew another victim who said she was raped at gunpoint in a garage on the University of Nevada, Reno campus in October 2007, but had not reported the crime.&lt;ref name="disappeared15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=4304030 |title=Reno Campus on Edge After Attacks |publisher=ABCNews.com |date=February 17, 2008 |accessdate=February 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301151458/http://www.abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=4304030 |archivedate=March 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mynews4.com/news/local/james-biela-returns-to-court-for-rape-and-murder-of-19-year-old-reno-woman|title=James Biela returns to court for rape and murder of 19-year-old Reno woman|first=Terri Hendry &amp; Jaclyn|last=Shearer|website=mynews4.com|publisher=[[KRNV-DT]]|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police began interviewing nearly 100 registered sex offenders who live within a mile of the MacKay Court home.

On February 15, 2008, Albert Jimenez of Reno was returning from his lunchbreak at a [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] restaurant. As he was walking by the road, he noticed bright orange colored fabric standing out among a pile of discarded tree limbs that were lying in a ditch. While he approached closer he discovered the neon orange socks were attached to feet. What he had thought was a mannequin at first turned out to be a deceased woman. Jimenez had heard about Brianna Denison's kidnapping, but didn't think the victim resembled the photograph he'd seen on billboards. Jimenez didn't have a cell phone with him, so he quickly returned to his place of employment, EE Technologies, to call Reno police. When police arrived to the South Reno lot, Jimenez was told that the victim was Denison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.rgj.com/article/20100518/NEWS01/100518002/Biela-trial-Man-who-discovered-Brianna-Denison-s-body-South-Reno-field-takes-stand|title=Man Who Discovered Brianna Denison's Body in South Reno, Takes Stand}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 2008, an [[autopsy]] report confirmed that the body found in a field near a Reno business park was Brianna Denison.&lt;ref name="disappeared6"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/02/16/missing.student.ap/index.html | title =  Police: Dead student victim of serial rapist | publisher = CNN.com | date = February 17, 2008 | accessdate = February 23, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080218090230/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/02/16/missing.student.ap/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = February 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police said that the clothing item did not belong to Denison and that it may have been left near her body to taunt the investigators.&lt;ref name="disappeared5"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/02/20/national/main3850749.shtml | title = Panties May Be Clue To Serial Rapist | publisher = CBSNews.com | date = February 20, 2008 | accessdate = February 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police asked that anyone who may recognize the clothing item as theirs come forward as they may know the identity of the perpetrator.

=== Arrest ===
On Tuesday, November 25, 2008, James Michael Biela, 27, of [[Sparks, Nevada]], was arrested and booked at the Washoe County Jail on charges of murder, first-degree kidnapping, and sexual assault.&lt;ref name="arrest1"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,457717,00.html | title = Police Arrest Suspect in Sex Assault Slaying of Reno Teen Brianna Denison | publisher = FoxNews.com | date = November 26, 2008 | accessdate = November 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrest occurred while he was dropping his son off at the Stepping Stones Children's Center in Reno.&lt;ref name="arrest1"/&gt; A DNA sample was collected from Biela.&lt;ref name="trial1"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/01/02/brianna.denison/index.html | title = Former Marine pleads not guilty to raping, killing college student | publisher = CNN.com | date = January 2, 2009 | accessdate = January 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously been arrested in 2001 for threatening his former girlfriend's neighbor with a knife.&lt;ref name="arrest2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rgj.com/article/20081126/NEWS18/81126016 | title = Biela's father: 'Why did he do this to this lady?' | publisher = rgj.com (Reno Gazette-Journal) | date = November 26, 2008 | accessdate = November 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press conference held by the Reno Police Department on Wednesday, November 26, 2008, it was confirmed that the DNA collected from Biela matched the DNA found at the crime scene, positively linking him to both the murder of Brianna Denison and a previous sexual assault.&lt;ref name="arrest2"/&gt;

At this same press conference, it was said that Biela had been turned in by a friend of Biela's girlfriend via Secret Witness on November 1, 2008. Biela's girlfriend had confided to this friend that she had found underwear unknown to her in Biela's truck as they were coming back from Washington state, where Biela had taken a job in March. Widespread media reports began circulating that included a police sketch of a suspect and a description of a vehicle used in a rape the month before Brianna's abduction. According to Reno Police Department Chief Michael Poehlman, Biela was questioned by Reno Police Detectives after the Secret Witness tip came in. He denied involvement and declined to provide a DNA sample. Biela's girlfriend was also questioned and gave police permission to obtain DNA from her four-year-old son, whom Biela had fathered. That test indicated that a direct relative of his had left DNA at the home Brianna Denison was abducted from, and from another rape that had taken place the month before Brianna's abduction. With this evidence, police obtained an arrest warrant and a warrant for Biela's DNA. Chief Poehlman announced at the press conference that the [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]] Sheriff's Department crime lab had tested Biela's DNA and found it did match DNA from the Denison case and another rape. Washoe County District Attorney Dick Gammick told reporters at the press conference that he would be prosecuting the case with one of his lead criminal deputies, Elliot Sattler, and his office would be seeking the "maximum penalty" for Biela, up to and including the death penalty.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

It was also announced that Biela, on his way to Washington, had sold his truck in Idaho, one which matched the description of the vehicle used in the previous sexual assault. At the press conference, officials said the vehicle was being returned to Reno to be searched and used as evidence in the case against Biela.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Trial and sentencing ===
On Thursday, May 27, 2010, Biela was found guilty of the murder of Brianna Denison.  The jury returned a guilty verdict for all counts against Biela which included kidnapping, sexual assault, and murder after deliberating for about nine hours. Defense attorneys argued against the death penalty, stating that Biela suffered an abusive childhood due to an alcoholic father, that he had been a productive member of society prior to his crimes, and that he had been a model prisoner.  Jurors did not accept the mitigating factors and handed down the death sentence. On July 30, 2010, Judge Robert Perry sentenced Biela to four additional life sentences for multiple counts of rape and kidnapping associated with attacks on two victims prior to Denison's abduction and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hutton|first=Auburn|title=Pregnant Rape Victim Forgives James Biela In Court|url=http://www.kolotv.com/news/headlines/99660154.html|work=kolotv.com|publisher=KOLO-TV, Reno, NV|accessdate=October 27, 2011|date=July 30, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424000652/http://www.kolotv.com/news/headlines/99660154.html|archivedate=April 24, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The sale of [[handgun]]s, [[electroshock weapon|stunguns]] and [[pepper spray]] increased dramatically in the [[University of Nevada, Reno]] area after Denison's body was found.&lt;ref name="disappeared16"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ktvn.com/Global/story.asp?S=7902229&amp;nav=menu549_2_5 | title =  More People are Buying Guns for Protection | publisher = ktvn.com | date = February 21, 2008 | accessdate = February 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denison's mother founded the Bring Bri Justice Foundation to try to implement changes after Denison's body was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bring Bri Justice hosts community sBring Bri Justice hosts community safety event afety event|url=http://www.dailysparkstribune.com/pages/full_story/push?article-Bring+Bri+Justice+hosts+community+safety+event+%20&amp;id=9412381|publisher=Sparks Tribune|accessdate=October 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424014536/http://www.dailysparkstribune.com/pages/full_story/push?article-Bring+Bri+Justice+hosts+community+safety+event+%20&amp;id=9412381|archive-date=April 24, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Long Night of Museums]] was held for the first time in [[Berlin]] in 1997. Since then a similar format has been adopted all over the continent under different names.&lt;ref&gt;Lange Nacht der Museen in Berlin; Nuit Blanche in Paris; La Nuit des Musées in France; Museums-n8 event in Amsterdam; Coordinated long nights in Austria, Italy, and Liechtenstein; Noc Muzeów in Poland; Múzeumok Éjszakája in Budapest; Museums at Night in the UK; Noć muzeja in Belgrade; Pražská muzejní noc in Prague&lt;/ref&gt; Today more than 120 cities in Europe organize their local "Night", an event which has turned into popular cultural events. "The Night of Museums" in [[Bulgaria]] was held for the first time on 30 September 2005 in the city of [[Plovdiv]]. It is now called Share the Night and is three days of art performances in galleries, cafes, and public spaces all over the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Share the Night 2017|url=http://night.bg/en|website=Night.bg/En}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 'Plovdiv Night’ ==
"The Night of Museums" in [[Bulgaria]] was held for the first time on a large scale on 30 September 2005 in the city of [[Plovdiv]] thanks to the initiative of Sariev Gallery and the civil committee "Night of Museums and Galleries – Plovdiv".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artknowledgenews.com/2009-05-17-05-27-54.html&lt;/ref&gt; From then on '''"The Night of Museums and Galleries – Plovdiv"''' became an emblematic event&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/bulgaria/plovdiv-and-rodopi-mountains/plovdiv/sights/466284&lt;/ref&gt; on a national level offering a program with various events, high attendance, attracting of young audience, positive energy and organization.

'''Operational Stress Injury''' or '''OSI''' is a non-clinical, non-medical term referring to a persistent [[Mental disorder|psychological difficulty]] caused by [[traumatic experience]]s or prolonged high stress or fatigue during service as a [[Military service|military member]] or [[first responder]].&lt;ref name="theroyal.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroyal.ca/mental-health-centre/mental-health-programs/areas-of-care/operational-stress-injuries-and-ptsd/ |title=Operational Stress Injuries and PTSD - The Royal |website=Theroyal.ca |date= |accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parl.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Committee/412/secd/rep/rep17jun15-e.pdf |format=PDF |title=INTERIM REPORT ON THE OPERATIONAL STRESS INJURIES OF CANADA’S VETERANS |website=Parl.gc.ca |accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term does not replace any individual diagnoses or disorders, but rather describes a category of mental health concerns linked to the particular challenges that these military members or first responders encounter in their service. There is not yet a single fixed definition. The term was first conceptualized within the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] to help foster understanding of the broader [[mental health]] challenges faced by military members who have been impacted by traumatic experiences and who face difficulty as a result.&lt;ref name="parl.gc.ca"/&gt; OSI encompasses a number of the diagnoses found in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) classification system, with the common thread being a linkage to the operational experiences of the afflicted.&lt;ref name="vac-mh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/services/health/mental-health/understanding-mental-health |title=Understanding Mental Health |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-02-12 |website=veterans.gc.ca |publisher=Veterans Affairs Canada |access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has gained traction outside of the military community as an appropriate way to describe similar challenges suffered by those whose work regularly exposes them to trauma, particularly front line emergency first responders such as but not limited to police, firefighters, paramedics, correctional officers, and emergency dispatchers.&lt;ref name="secu"/&gt; The term, at present mostly used within Canada, is increasingly significant in the development of legislation, policy, treatments and benefits in the military and first responder communities.&lt;ref name="secu"/&gt;

==History==
Military members experiencing wartime trauma may suffer debilitating psychological effects from their experiences, and historical research has found literary references to these psychological packs throughout recorded history.&lt;ref name="USDVA-PTSD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/PTSD-overview/basics/history-of-ptsd-vets.asp |title=History of PTSD in Veterans: Civil War to DSM-5 |author=Friedman, Matthew |date=2015-08-13 |website=ptsd.va.gov |publisher=US Department of Veterans Affairs |access-date=2017-03-14 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the First World War era, psychological symptoms suffered by soldiers in war came to be referred to as "[[shell shock]]".&lt;ref name="USDVA-PTSD"/&gt; This progressed by the Second World War to being called "[[Posttraumatic stress disorder|battle fatigue]]", or "[[combat stress reaction]]".&lt;ref name="USDVA-PTSD"/&gt; As research continued and the understanding of psychology and psychiatry advanced, it gradually became more understood through the 20th century that experiencing trauma could have a variety of psychological and emotional impacts that were genuinely medical in nature.&lt;ref name="USDVA-PTSD"/&gt; Increasingly, research focused on developing clinical definitions and exploring options for treatments and therapies. The term '[[Posttraumatic stress disorder]]' (PTSD), was developed for inclusion in the [[DSM-III]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clinicaladvisor.com/psychiatry-information-center/caring-for-veterans-with-ptsd/article/453197/|title=Caring for veterans with PTSD|website=Clinicaladvisor.com\accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not a condition limited to those who had experienced wartime trauma, PTSD is often associated with soldiers returning from wartime.

In 2001, [[Canadian Forces]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Stéphane Grenier (soldier)|Stéphane Grenier]] coined the term 'Operational stress injury' to describe a mental or emotional injury suffered by soldiers in the course of their service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsb.com/speakers/stephane-grenier/ |title=Stéphane Grenier &amp;#124; Speaker &amp;#124; National Speakers Bureau |website=Nsb.com |date=2015-11-26 |accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was designed to expand the understanding of mental health disorders related to service beyond just PTSD, and to include other clinical diagnoses linked to trauma. The word 'injury' was chosen to help shift the view of these disorders in order to extend to them the same legitimacy in discourse as physical injuries, and to help reduce the [[Social stigma|stigma]] surrounding mental health.&lt;ref name="parl.gc.ca"/&gt; Not a diagnosis itself, operational stress injury was described by the Canadian Forces as a “grouping of diagnoses that are related to injuries that occur as part of operations", most commonly PTSD, [[major depression]], and [[generalized anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/assets/FORCES_Internet/docs/en/about-reports-pubs-health/surg-gen-mental-health-strategy.pdf |format=PDF |title=Surgeon General’s Mental Health Strategy : Canadian Forces Health Services Group |website=Forces.gc.ca |accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016, the Canadian Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security recognized OSIs as an issue faced by all first responder organizations, not just the military.&lt;ref name="secu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/hoc/Committee/421/SECU/Reports/RP8457704/securp05/securp05-e.pdf |format=PDF |title=HEALTHY MINDS, SAFE COMMUNITIES : SUPPORTING OUR PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS THROUGH A NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR OPERATIONAL STRESS INJURIES |website=Parl.gc.ca |accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2016, the Parliament of Canada is exploring a national strategy to address OSIs within the various public safety professions.&lt;ref name="secu"/&gt; The term does not as of yet have any regular use outside of Canada.

==Commonly included diagnoses==
The concept of operational stress injury is still emerging and evolving, and does not as of yet have a commonly accepted fixed definition.&lt;ref name="parl.gc.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="secu"/&gt; Research within the Canadian military has nonetheless identified several disorders most commonly associated with traumatic service-related experiences, and which have generally been accepted as included in the term.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Deployment-related mental disorders among Canadian Forces personnel deployed in support of the mission in Afghanistan, 2001–2008|first1=David|last1=Boulos|first2=Mark A.|last2=Zamorski|date=6 August 2013|publisher=|journal=CMAJ|volume=185|issue=11|pages=E545–E552|doi=10.1503/cmaj.122120|pmid=23820441|pmc=3735772}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same psychiatric conditions are the subject of considerable study and public policy discussion among the first responder professions.&lt;ref name="parl.gc.ca1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=e&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=42&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=8457704&amp;File=18|title=House of Commons Committees - SECU (42-1) - Healthy Minds, Safe Communities: Supporting our Public Safety Officers through a National Strategy for Operational Stress Injuries - STUDY ON OPERATIONAL STRESS INJURIES AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER IN PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS|website=Parl.gc.ca|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two or more of these diagnoses may be [[comorbid]], and comorbidity may also exist with physical injuries or illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/about-us/reports/departmental-audit-evaluation/2008-10-evaluation-osi-clinic-network |title=Evaluation of the Operational Stress Injury (OSI) Clinic Network - October 2008 - Departmental Audit and Evaluation Reports - Veterans Affairs Canada |website=Veterans.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posttraumatic stress disorder===
Posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is among the most common individual diagnoses linked to traumatic exposure in military or first responder service.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncmedicaljournal.com/content/76/5/299|title=Mental Health Among Military Personnel and Veterans|first1=Treven|last1=Pickett|first2=David|last2=Rothman|first3=Eric F.|last3=Crawford|first4=Mira|last4=Brancu|first5=John A.|last5=Fairbank|first6=Harold S.|last6=Kudler|date=1 November 2015|publisher=|journal=North Carolina Medical Journal|volume=76|issue=5|pages=299–306|doi=10.18043/ncm.76.5.299|pmid=26946859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parl.gc.ca1"/&gt; PTSD is related to anxiety disorders, and is linked to the intrusive and unwanted re-experiencing of traumatic events. Those suffering from PTSD will often seek to avoid and may be triggered by stimuli that cause recollection of their traumatic exposures. Symptoms may include inability to sleep, anger, irritability, fear, hypervigilance, and hyperarousal. A study of over 30,000 Canadian soldiers following deployments to Afghanistan and the former Yugoslavia found 8.9% of the study cohort to be suffering from PTSD after an average follow-up period of nearly four years.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Depression===
[[major depression|Depression]] refers, generally, to Major Depressive Disorder or related [[mood disorders]]. Depression is widely believed to be the most prevalent mental health diagnosis faced by military members and first responders, accounting for a significant portion of those who are unable to work fully or at all due to mental health reasons. Research within the Canadian Armed Forces has found that at least 8% of full-time members of the Canadian Military exhibit symptoms of major depression.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-624-x/2014001/article/14121-eng.htm |title=Mental health of the Canadian Armed Forces |website=Statcan.gc.ca |date=2015-11-27 |accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anxiety disorders===
[[Anxiety disorders]], including General Anxiety Disorder, [[acute stress reaction|Acute Stress Disorder]], [[Social Anxiety Disorder]], and other related diagnoses are also frequently found in the military and first response community.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; While PTSD falls under the larger category of anxiety disorders, it is often considered distinctly due to its greater prevalence than other anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders frequently manifest in the form of debilitating stress and anxiety experienced by a victim in the presence or anticipation of triggering stimuli. Anxiety may be disabling in that it may render someone incapable of coping well or at all with a situation that would normally be within their capabilities absent the clinical anxiety. Military research has found anxiety disorders to be more prevalent in those who had deployed to active conflicts.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  When PTSD is totalled with other anxiety disorders, this category of mental health diagnosis is the most prevalent among Canadian military personnel with deployments &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Adjustment disorder===
A lesser known but not uncommon diagnosis among military personnel,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[adjustment disorder|Adjustment Disorder]] (sometimes referred to as situational depression) is characterized by an individual's inability to adjust to external stressors, or major life events. Although presentation will vary, it may include a combination of depressive, anxious, or post-traumatic stress symptoms that do not meet the clinical threshold for those related named disorders. Adjustment disorder often abates once a person is able to adapt to new circumstances. Military members and first responders may potentially face significant life changes in their careers, including geographic relocations, exposure to very different cultural norms, and potentially the life changing impact of injury or illness and the inability to continue with their career.

===Substance-related disorder===
[[Substance-related disorder]], or the abuse of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or [[drugs]], may also be included in the Operational Stress Injury umbrella.&lt;ref name="theroyal.ca"/&gt; The various psychological effects of different substances, particularly the depressive effects of excess alcohol consumption, often serve as a form of 'self medication' for those dealing with other stressors or traumas. Alcohol or drug [[addiction]]s can often mask or complicate the treatment of symptoms of other disorders, and may need to be addressed before treatment for underlying disorders can be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/about-us/policy/document/1104 |title=Policy Document - Veterans Affairs Canada |website=Veterans.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suicide==
There is a well established link between Operational Stress Injury symptoms, and a heightened risk of [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/2013-91-e.htm#a5|title=Current Issues in Mental Health in Canada: Mental Health in the Canadian Forces and Among Veterans|publisher=Parliament of Canada|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; While suicide and suicidality data for military and public safety professions is not comprehensive, these professions are not exceptions to established links between the various mental health disorders and a greater risk of death by suicide.

==Treatment approaches==
The various disorders that are broadly called 'operational stress injuries' each have their own bodies of research into various treatments and therapies. Most treatments can either be considered [[pharmacological]], such as [[antidepressant]] or [[antianxiety]] medication, or psychosocial [[therapy]], such as [[cognitive behavioural therapy]]. For many patients a combined approach is used,&lt;ref name="theroyal.ca"/&gt; with medications helping to stabilize moods and symptoms while behavioural therapy helps to address underlying memories, cognitions, situation appraisals, and other thinking patterns.

The military and public safety professions vary widely among differing jurisdictions as to what is available in terms of therapy. Military members in western nations typically are covered to some extent by their respective military health services, or by governmental departments dedicated to providing services to veterans, such as [[Veterans Affairs Canada]] or the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]]. Police, firefighters, paramedics, and other related professions will each have differing health care arrangements and benefits depending on the health services an insurance arrangements in their respective country, state, province, territory, or municipality.

In addition to formal healthcare settings, numerous [[grassroots]] or state-funded peer support organizations have emerged. Many of these organizations help affected veterans or first responders to connect with each other in physical or virtual peer support settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/investigations/afghanistan-war-veterans-turn-to-social-media-for-community-and-solace/article32808067/ |title=Afghanistan war veterans turn to social media for community and solace |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date= |accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly these organizations have played a role in crisis intervention, suicide prevention, and ongoing support. While informal peer support efforts do not substitute for proper clinical care, they help some affected personnel to begin accepting that they are suffering from traumatic or other stress linked to their occupations, and to begin accessing clinical resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9340">'''Perpetrator trauma''', also known as '''perpetration-''' or '''participation-induced traumatic stress ''' (both abbreviated PITS), occurs when the symptoms of [[posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) are caused by an act or acts of killing or similar horrific violence.

Perpetrator trauma is similar but distinct from [[moral injury]], which focuses on the psychological, cultural, and spiritual aspects of a perceived moral transgression which produces profound shame.
== As a psychiatric disorder ==
===Status===
The ''[[DSM-5]]'' addresses the idea of active participation as a cause of [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] under the discussion accompanying its definition of PTSD, and adds to the list of causal factors: “for military personnel, being a perpetrator, witnessing atrocities, or killing the enemy.”

There has been some study with [[Veteran|combat veterans]],&lt;ref name=name1&gt;MacNair, R. M. (2002). ''Perpetration-Induced Traumatic Stress: The psychological consequences of killing''. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, D. (1995). ''On killing: The psychological cost of learning to kill in war and society''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maguen, S., Metzler, T. J., Litz, B. T., Seal, K. H., Knight, S. J., &amp; Marmar, C. R. (2009). The impact of killing in war on mental health symptoms and related functioning. ''Journal of Traumatic Stress'', 22, 435-443.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maguen S., Lucenko B., Reger M.A., Gahm G., Litz B., Seal K., Knight S., Marmar C.R. (2010). The impact of reported direct and indirect killing on mental health symptoms in Iraq war veterans. ''Journal of Traumatic Stress'', 23, 86-90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baalbaki, Zenobia S. (2010) Perpetration in combat, trauma, and the social psychology of killing: An integrative review of clinical and social psychology literature with implications for treatment. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, Vol 70(10-B), 2010, 6537&lt;/ref&gt; people who carry out [[Capital punishment|executions]] or [[torture]], police who shoot in the line of duty, people who commit criminal [[homicide]], [[abortion]] staff, and others.&lt;ref name=name1/&gt; Much of the study was previous to the official definition of PTSD, and symptoms have shown up in personal stories throughout history, and in the keen observations of the writers of great literature, most notably ''[[Macbeth]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Severity===

Indications from all studies that have considered the question of severity have indicated that symptoms tend to be more severe for those who have killed than for other causes of traumatization. One study &lt;ref&gt;MacNair, R. M. (2002). Brief Report: Perpetration-Induced Traumatic Stress in Combat Veterans. ''Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology'', vol. 8, no. 1, pp. 63-72.&lt;/ref&gt; using the U.S. government data base of [[Vietnam veteran|American veterans of Vietnam]] &lt;ref&gt;Kulka, R. A., Schlenger, W..E., Fairbank, J. A., Hough, R. L., Jordan, B. K., Marmar, C. R., &amp; Weiss, D. S. (1990). ''Trauma and the Vietnam war generation: Report on the findings from the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study''. New York: Brunner/Mazel.&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that the pattern of symptoms at least in combat veterans may be different in those who said they had killed as opposed to those who said they had not, with intrusive imagery ([[Dream|dreams]], [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]], unwanted thoughts) being more prominent along with the explosive outbursts of [[anger]], and [[concentration]] and [[memory problems]] being less prominent. To a lesser extent, [[hypervigilance]], a sense of [[Social alienation|alienation]], and the non-PTSD symptom of a sense of disintegration were also found greater as a matter of pattern for those who answered yes on killing. Additionally, [[Alcohol abuse|alcohol]] and [[cocaine abuse]] appeared to be more severe.

===Dream motifs===

Compared to the victim form of being traumatized, there are different dream motifs reported. While the [[Eidetic imagery|eidetic dreams]] – that is, those that are like a video of the event playing in the head – can be experienced as they are with traumatized victims, other motifs also appear more commonly&lt;ref name=name1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glover, H. (1985). Guilt and aggression in Vietnam veterans. ''American Journal of Social Psychiatry'', 1, 15-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lifton, R. J. (1990). Adult dreaming: Frontiers of form. In R. A. Neminoff &amp; C. A. Colarusso (Eds.), ''New dimensions in adult development'' (pp. 419-442). New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
One is that of having the tables turned and being the one killed, or being very vulnerable in the same situation. Another motif is that of the victims accusing the dreaming person or demanding to know why he or she did it.  Also possible is a motif of the self being split in two so that the killer part of the person is seen as actually being a different person.

==Therapy==
Therapies that have shown some effectiveness in the treatment of perpetrator trauma include [[group therapy]], [[Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing|eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing]],&lt;ref&gt;Lipke, H. (2000). ''EMDR and psychotherapy integration''. Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press&lt;/ref&gt; Time Perspective Therapy &lt;ref&gt;Zimbardo, P.G., Sword, R. M., &amp; Sword, R.K.M. (2012). ''The time cure: Overcoming PTSD with the new psychology of time perspective therapy''. San Francisco: Jossey Bass&lt;/ref&gt; and understanding how common the problem is.&lt;ref&gt;[Yalom, I. (1995). ''The theory and practice of group psychotherapy''. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; Those who suffer, many of whom participated in [[violence]] as a matter of social expectation, find it beneficial to know that they are having a normal reaction to an abnormal situation, and are not uniquely cowardly or crazy. Traditional remedies of [[atonement]], [[forgiveness]], and bearing witness have also stood the test of time as being helpful.&lt;ref&gt;Foa, E. B., Meadows, E. A. (1997). Psychosocial treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder: A critical review. ''Annual Review of Psychology'', 48, 449-480.&lt;/ref&gt;
More vigorous studies are needed for all these suggestions, as well as common PTSD therapies that have not yet been thoroughly explored with the distinction of perpetration versus victimization in mind.

Other proposed treatments have been proven to be ineffective. The “flooding” technique, technically called [[Prolonged exposure therapy|Prolonged Exposure]], which desensitizes the sufferer of trauma by repeated exposure to reminders of it in controlled settings, appears to be a bad idea, counter-indicated when the trauma involved being active in inflicting harm.&lt;ref&gt;Pitman, R. K., Altman, B., Greenwald, E., Longpre, R. E., Macklin, M. L., Poire, R. E.,  &amp; Steketee, G. S. (1991). Psychiatric complications during flooding therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder. ''Journal of Clinical Psychiatry'', 52, 17-20.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that expressive writing, which most people find helpful in working through their traumas, instead increases anger in soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Munsey, C. (2009, October). Writing about wounds. ''Monitor on Psychology'', 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in what physiological mechanisms in what pharmaceutical drugs might be useful in therapy are not yet known.

==Cycles of violence==

Several of the symptoms are capable of causing or allowing for renewed acts of violence.&lt;ref name=name1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silva, J. A., Derecho, D.V., Leong, G. B., Weinstock, R., &amp; Ferrari, M. M. (2001). A classification of psychological factors leading to violent behavior in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. ''Journal of Forensic Sciences'', 46, 309-316.&lt;/ref&gt; The outbursts of anger can have an impact in [[domestic violence]] and [[street crime]]. The sense of [[emotional numbing]], [[Emotional detachment|detachment]] and estrangement from other people can also contribute to these, along with contributing to participation in further battle activities or to [[Apathy|apathetic]] reactions when violence is done by others.

{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Cyrus the Great}}
The '''Persian Revolt''' was a campaign led by [[Cyrus the Great]] in which the province of ancient [[Persis]], which had been under [[Medes|Median]] rule, declared its independence and fought a successful revolution, separating from the [[Medes|Median Empire]]. Cyrus and the Persians did not stop there, however, and in turn went on and conquered the Medes.

==The War==
The revolt, which lasted from 552 BC to 550 BC, was triggered by the actions of [[Astyages]], the ruler of [[Medes|Media]]. The war spread to other provinces who allied with the Persians. The Medes had early successes in battle, but the comeback by [[Cyrus the Great]] and his army was too overwhelming, and the Medes were finally conquered by 549 BC. Thus the first official [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] was born.

A '''repeal''' is the [[Administrative removal|removal]] or [[Reversal (law)|reversal]] of a [[law]]. There are two basic types of repeal, a repeal with a re-enactment (or replacement) of the repealed law, or a repeal without any replacement.

Removal of [[primary and secondary legislation|secondary legislation]] is normally referred to as revocation rather than repeal in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]]. Under the [[common law]] of [[England and Wales]], the effect of repealing a statute was "to obliterate it completely from the records of Parliament as though it had never been passed."&lt;ref&gt;Kay v. Goodwin (1830) 6 Bing. 576, per Tindal C.J.&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, is now subject to savings provisions within the [[Interpretation Act 1978]].

In [[parliamentary procedure]], the [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] to rescind, repeal, or annul is used to cancel or countermand an action or order previously adopted by the [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]].

==Partial or full repeals==

A '''partial repeal''' occurs when a specified part or provision of a previous Act is repealed but other provisions remain in force. For example, the [[Acts of Union 1800]], providing for the union between the formerly separate kingdoms of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] as the [[United Kingdom]], was partially repealed in 1922, when (as a consequence of the 1921 [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]), twenty-six of the thirty-two counties of Ireland were constituted as the [[Irish Free State]], and ceased to form part of the United Kingdom.

A '''full repeal''' occurs where the entire Act in question is repealed.

=={{anchor|Reenactment}}&lt;!-- [[Repeal with reenactment]] redirects here --&gt;Repeal with or without re-enactment==

A typical situation where an Act is '''repealed and re-enacted''' is where the law in the area is being updated but the law being repealed needs to be replaced with one suitable for the modern era.  Re-enactment can be with or without amendment, although repeal and re-enactment without amendment normally occurs only in the context of a [[consolidation bill]] (a bill to consolidate the law in a particular area).

For example, the repeal of the [[Poor Law]]s in England in 1948 reflected their replacement by modern social welfare legislation.

A '''repeal without replacement''' is generally done when a law is no longer effective, or it is shown that a law is having far more negative consequences than were originally envisioned.

If a campaign for the repeal of a particular law gains particular momentum, an advocate of the repeal might become known as a "repealer". The [[Repeal Association]] in 19th-century Ireland advocated Irish independence through repeal of the [[Acts of Union 1800]].

Many repeals without replacement are the result of significant changes in [[society]].  Major examples include:
*The old [[Jim Crow law]]s or [[blue law]]s in the US
*The [[Corn Laws]] in [[England]], repealed in 1846 after a passionate campaign.
*[[Repeal of Prohibition in the United States]]. Enacted by the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], it proved to be so ineffective that it had to be repealed by the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]]. This is the only [[constitutional amendment]] to be have ever been repealed in the [[United States]].
*The massive [[Statute Law Revision Act 2007 (Ireland)|Statute Law Revision Act 2007]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]], through which 3,225 Acts were repealed, dating back over eight centuries to 1171 and the earliest laws enacted by [[England]] when it began its invasion of [[Ireland]]. The statutes repealed include a number of Acts of significant historical interest, including an Act of 1542 providing that the Kings of England shall be Kings of Ireland. This Act is the largest single repealing statute in the history of Ireland.

==Express or implied repeal==
The repeal of a [[statute]] may be either express or [[implied repeal|implied]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Vauxhall Estates, Ltd. v. Liverpool Corporation [1932] 1 KB 733&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Express repeal''' occurs where express words are used in a statute to repeal an earlier statute. They are now usually included in a table in a schedule to the statute, for reasons of convenience.

In the United States, when a bill is passed by the House and Senate and signed by the president, or Congress overrides a presidential veto, the various provisions contained within the newly enacted law are rearranged according to their policy content and cataloged in the [[United States Code]]—a compilation of the general and permanent federal laws of the United States.  To repeal any element of an enacted law, Congress must pass a new law containing repeal language and the codified statute's location in the U.S. Code (including the title, chapter, part, section, paragraph and clause).  In this way, Congress (and the president) must follow the same rules and procedures for passing any law.  When statutes are repealed, their text is simply deleted from the Code and replaced by a note summarizing what used to be there.  Once deleted, the repealed statute no longer has the force of law.  All repeals of parts of the US Code are, therefore, express repeals.

'''[[Implied repeal]]''' occurs where two statutes are mutually inconsistent. The effect is that the later statute repeals the earlier statute [[pro tanto]] (in so far as it is inconsistent).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; As past and future parliaments are equally sovereign, later parliaments can carry out implied repeal of earlier statute by passing an inconsistent statute, but inconsistency needs to be established before implied repeal can occur.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Street Estates v. Minister of Health [1934] 1 KB 590&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repeals with or without savings==

Repeals can be with or without savings.

A '''repeal without savings''' eliminates the repealed statute completely.

A '''repeal with savings''' preserves the effect of the repealed statute for limited purposes, such as acts already done or in hand, or regulations made under the repealed Act are continued in force.  In England and Wales, sections 15 to 17, and section 19(2), of the Interpretation Act 1978 set out general savings and similar provisions exist in the law of Ireland and other common law countries.

== Parliamentary procedure ==

===Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR)===
{{infobox motion

| class = B

| reconsidered = Negative vote only
}}In [[Meeting (parliamentary procedure)|meetings]] of a deliberative assembly, the motions to '''rescind''' (or "repeal" or "annul") and '''amend something previously adopted''' are used to change action that was taken. They are two forms of the same [[incidental main motion]] and they follow the same rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 305|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors = et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A motion to postpone an event or action previously scheduled is a particular case of the motion to amend something previously adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Robert's Rules of Order]], the rules for this motion protect against instability arising from small variations in attendance from one meeting to the next. For this reason, the requirements for changing a previous action are greater than those for taking the action in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = li}}&lt;/ref&gt; A motion to rescind, repeal, annul or amend something already adopted requires a [[two-thirds vote]], a [[majority vote]] with [[previous notice]], or a vote of a [[majority of the entire membership]], any one of which would suffice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 306–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure|Demeter's Manual]] imposes a similar requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl|title=DEM|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When this motion is used in a [[committee]], RONR requires a two-thirds vote unless all committee members who voted for the motion to be rescinded or amended are present or have received ample notice; in which case a majority vote is required.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure (TSC)===
Under [[The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure]], a repeal or amendment of something already adopted requires only the same vote (usually a majority) and notice that was needed to adopt it in the first place.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite parl|title=TSC|pages=43}} (TSC)&lt;/ref&gt; This book states, "As a general rule, fewer than a majority should not be authorized to decide anything, and more than a majority should not be required for most decisions"; the book further states that the problem with situations in which a supermajority is required is that "the minority, not the majority, controls."&lt;ref&gt;TSC, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative use===
In legislative bodies, the motion to rescind is used for much the same purpose as the motion to [[reconsider]]; many court decisions treat the two motions as one motion. However, in legislative contexts, it is not the same as a motion to repeal. The difference between rescind and reconsider is that the motion to rescind is ordinarily applied to actions that have been taken and are already in effect. It has been described as being in the nature of a motion to amend by striking out the entire proposal and leaving nothing remaining. It is not in order when the question can be reached by a motion to reconsider. Once legislation has been actually enacted, it is too late to rescind. The vote required to rescind is the same as would be required to repeal the act which it sought to rescind (usually a majority).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl|title=MAS|edition=2000|year=2000|pages=321–323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rescind and expunge from the minutes ==
The motion to '''rescind and expunge from the minutes''' is used to express the strongest disapproval about action previously taken by a deliberative assembly. Using ''Roberts Rules of Order Newly Revised'', this motion requires a vote of a majority of the entire membership.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using ''The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure'', the motion to expunge requires a majority vote (of those voting). The secretary does not erase the expunged motion, but draws a line around it, marks it "expunged by order of this assembly," gives the date of the expunging, and signs the notation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The expunged motion is not included in any [[minutes]] published thereafter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''''Shinyō Maru'' incident''' occurred in the [[Second Philippine Republic|Philippines]] on September 7, 1944, in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] of [[World War II]]. In an attack on a [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] convoy by the [[United States|American]] [[submarine]] [[USS Paddle (SS-263)|USS ''Paddle'']], 668 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[prisoners of war]] were killed fighting their Japanese guards or killed when their ship, the [[SS Shinyō Maru|SS ''Shinyō Maru'']] was sunk. Only 82 Americans survived the ordeal and were later rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.submarinesailor.com/history/pow/paddlesinksshinyomaru/|title=The American Prisoners of War Rescued after the sinking of the Japanese transport, Shinyō Maru, by the USS Paddle, SS 263, on 7 September 1944|last=Mazza|first=Eugene A.|publisher=Submarine Sailor|date=February 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Hell Ship plaque.jpg|200px|left|thumb|The "Hell Ship" plaque for those who survived the SS ''Shinyō Maru'' affair]]
Following [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|the conquest of the Philippines]] in 1942 and the surrender of the [[United States Army]], thousands of Allied prisoners of war, mostly American, were being held on the islands which by 1944 were soon to be invaded by General [[Douglas MacArthur]]. To prevent the liberation of the prisoners in the Philippines, the Japanese established a system of transportation called "[[Hell Ship]]s" by those being transported. These Hell Ships were ordinary merchant vessels used to transport the Allied prisoners from the Philippines to elsewhere in the Japanese empire. These vessels were so-called because several of them were destroyed in friendly fire incidents. SS ''Shinyō Maru'' was one of these vessels; displacing 2,634 [[gross register tonnage|gross registered tons]], she was a [[tramp trade|tramp]] [[steamship|cargo steamer]] impounded by the Japanese in 1941 and crewed by both merchant sailors and [[Imperial Japanese Army]] soldiers. The soldiers manned the ship's [[machine gun]] and guarded 750 Allied prisoners in the holds, almost 300 of whom were survivors of the [[Bataan Death March]]. The Japanese commander is said to have been extremely ruthless. Expecting an attack by the Allies, he told the prisoners that if the ship were fired on, he would order the guards to begin killing them.&lt;ref name="MazzaMemories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morison"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morison|first=Samuel E.|title=History of United States Naval Operations in World War II. Vol. 12: Leyte, June 1944-January 1945|year=2002|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=0-252-07063-1|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
On September 7, the ''Shinyō Maru'' was sailing for [[Manila]] in convoy C-076 with seven other vessels, including two [[torpedo boat]]s, two [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]]s, and four other medium and small [[cargo ship]]s. They were sailing two to three miles off the Lanboyan Point of [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] on the island of [[Mindanao]], when the USS ''Paddle'' found them. A few days previously, American intelligence had reported the ''Shinyō Maru'' to be carrying Japanese soldiers, so they assigned ''Paddle'' to search for it. The ''Paddle'', under the command of Captain Byron Nowell, was 10 miles away when the Japanese were first spotted, so Nowell maneuvered forward to attack with torpedoes. A spread of four was then released in the direction of the ''Shinyō Maru'', which was the leading ship in the convoy. Two of the torpedoes struck, both in the hold, and a few moments later the ''Paddle'' was lined up against one of the cargo ships. It, too, was struck by two torpedoes, so her commander grounded her on the nearby shore to prevent the ship from sinking. Just after the ''Shinyō Maru'' was hit, the guards opened fire on the prisoners with captured [[Thompson submachine gun]]s, though several of the men fought their way out of the hold, with their fists and improvised weapons, and abandoned ship.&lt;ref name="MazzaMemories" /&gt;

The men of the convoy then began launching boats to pick up Japanese survivors and kill all of the remaining prisoners. A machine gun mounted on the grounded cargo ship and a second on the ''Shinyō Maru'' were also opened up on the Allied personnel. [[US Marines|Marine Corps]] Sergeant Onnie Clem later reported the following; "Up on the bridge there was a machine gun spraying the hatch. A burst of machine-gun fire caught all three of us and knocked us back down in the hold. We'd all been hit. I got plowed in the skull. Another bullet chipped out my chin. Nevertheless, I was able to work myself back up on deck, and I was eyeing that bridge when I came out that time. The gun was still there, but the gunner was laying out on deck. Somebody had apparently got up there and killed him. At this time I found out that we were out in the ocean about two or three miles from shore. All I had was a loincloth."&lt;ref&gt;Mazza citing ''With Only The Will To Live'' edited by Robert S. LaPorte, Ronald E. Marcello and Richard L. Himmell&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen or 20 others were recaptured and taken aboard one of the torpedo boats, where they were executed by [[firing squad]] as punishment for trying to escape. One of those men was able to free his hands which had been tied behind his back, and he successfully escaped by jumping overboard again.&lt;ref name="Morison" /&gt; The Japanese dropped 45 [[depth charge]]s and other explosives on the American submarine over the course of two hours, and the ship sustained some light damage, but nobody was hurt. After that, she surfaced and began patrolling the area again.&lt;ref name="MazzaMemories" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
Of 750 Allied prisoners of war, 668 were killed, all but five of whom were American servicemen. At least 47 Japanese personnel were killed, as well; only three men of the ''Shinyō Maru''{{'}}s crew survived.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.west-point.org/family/japanese-pow/ShinyoMaruRosterJPW.html. Complete Roster of POWs aboard Shinyō Maru.&lt;/ref&gt; Eighty-three Americans made it to the shores of [[Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte|Sindangan Bay]], and they received aid from friendly Filipino guerrillas under the command of [[Brigadier General]] [[Wendell Fertig]], who radioed headquarters about the situation. One man died the following day on September 8, the remaining survivors were eventually rescued by the submarine [[USS Narwhal (SS-167)|USS ''Narwhal'']] save First Sergeant Joseph P. Coe Jr&lt;ref&gt;Coe later rose to the rank of [[colonel]] in the American army&lt;/ref&gt; who remained on Mindanao to continue fighting, for which he later received a [[Bronze Star]].
The crew of USS ''Paddle'' was not informed of the deaths of hundreds of Allied POWs until 1946.&lt;ref name="MazzaMemories" /&gt;

The '''Southern Damascus offensive (March 2018)''' started on 12 March 2018, when ISIL began attacking rebel positions in the al-Qadam neighborhood of southern Damascus as they were evacuating.&lt;ref name="newoffensive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/breaking-isis-captures-several-areas-in-southern-damascus-after-launching-new-offensive/|title=Breaking: ISIS captures several areas in southern Damascus after launching new offensive|date=13 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebel pocket in al-Qadam had been surrounded on one side by government forces and on the other by ISIL.&lt;ref name="pocket"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-qadam/syrian-army-evacuates-militants-from-small-rebel-pocket-near-capital-idUSKCN1GP1ST|title=Syrian army evacuates militants from small rebel pocket near capital|date=13 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 March, ISIL threatened to kill any rebels that evacuate from the area after the Syrian government gave the rebels 48 hours to surrender the district and evacuate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-gives-rebels-48-hours-to-surrender-southern-damascus-district/|title=Syrian Army gives rebels 48 hours to surrender southern Damascus district|date=10 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following news of the upcoming rebel evacuation from al-Qadam, ISIL forces attacked the rebels on 12 March and captured 25 percent of the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=newoffensive/&gt; The next day, around 300 rebel fighters and their family members were evacuated from al-Qadam to rebel territory in Idlib province.&lt;ref name=pocket/&gt; After the evacuation, government troops took control of 70 percent of the neighborhood, while the remaining 30 was under IS control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/breaking-syrian-army-takes-control-of-70-percent-of-southern-damascus-district-despite-isis-attack/|title=Breaking: Syrian Army takes control of 70 percent of southern Damascus district despite ISIS attack|date=13 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fighting, government air-strikes were conducted against ISIL in [[Al-Hajar al-Aswad]] and al-Qadam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actionpal.org.uk/en/post/6767/flash-news/isis-launches-an-attack-on-the-qadam-neighborhood-in-south-damascus-amid-clashes-with-the-regime-s-forces|title=ISIS launches an attack on the Qadam neighborhood in south Damascus, amid clashes with the regime’s forces|first=Action Group for Palestinians of|last=Syria|website=www.actionpal.org.uk|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the clashes were taking place in Qadam, rebel groups attempted to break through ISIL lines in Yarmouk but were repelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/isis-drives-back-threatening-rebel-offensive-in-south-damascus/|title=ISIS drives back threatening rebel offensive in south Damascus|date=14 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March, ISIL launched an assault against Syrian Army positions in al-Qadam, managing to advance slightly.

On 21 March, it was reported that the military's death toll from ISIL's attack had rose to 62, after 26 bodies of the previously missing were retrieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2018/03/21/62-regime-fighters-dead-in-ISIS-attack-on-Syria-capital.html|title=62 regime fighters dead in ISIS attack on Syria capital|website=english.alarabiya.net|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, ISIL executed a captured commander from the Palestinian People’s Party, Nidal Darwish, in the al-Qadam neighborhood.&lt;ref name=21stmarch&gt;{{cite web|url=https://syrianwardaily.com/2018/03/21/syrian-war-daily-21st-of-march-2018/|title=Syrian War Daily – 21st of March 2018|date=21 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

On 19 April, the SAA and allied Palestinian militias launched an offensive to dislodge ISIL from the pocket.

During the night of 19 May, an agreement was put in place in southern Damascus between the Syrian Army and ISIL after the militants agreed to surrender their last positions in the Yarmouk Camp and Hajar Al-Aswad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/breaking-isis-terrorists-begin-leaving-southern-damascus/|title=Breaking: ISIS terrorists to begin leaving southern Damascus|date=2018-05-20|work=AMN - Al-Masdar News {{!}} المصدر نيوز|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, buses started entering the ISIL pocket to transport their fighters to the desert region in eastern Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/video-buses-enter-isis-held-districts-in-southern-damascus-to-start-evacuation-deal/|title=VIDEO: Buses enter ISIS-held districts in southern Damascus to start evacuation deal|date=2018-05-20|work=AMN - Al-Masdar News {{!}} المصدر نيوز|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on 21 May, the military officially announced that they had completely regained control of the area,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=syria alikhbaria|title=بيان القيادة العامة للجيش والقوات المسلحة حول تطهير منطقة الحجر الأسود|date=2018-05-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNzwHrEHB3Y|accessdate=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ending the existence of anti-government forces around the capital Damascus.

The '''Teatro Massimo Vittorio Emanuele''' is an [[opera house]] and opera company located on the Piazza Verdi in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]]. It was dedicated to King Victor Emanuel II.
It is the biggest in Italy, and one of the largest of Europe (the third after the [[Opéra National de Paris]] and the [[Vienna State Opera|K. K. Hof-Opernhaus]] in [[Vienna]]), renowned for its perfect acoustics.

==Construction and opening==
An international competition for the creation of the [[opera house]] was announced by the Palermo Council in 1864 at the instigation of the mayor, [[Antonio Starrabba di Rudinì]]. For many years there had been talk of building a large new [[theatre]] in Palermo, worthy of the second biggest city in southern Italy (after Naples) and designed to promote the image of the city following the unification of Italy in 1861.
[[File:Verdi palermo bust 200805.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust of [[Giuseppe Verdi]] outside of the Teatro Massimo]]

The opera house was designed and overseen by the Italian architect [[Giovan Battista Filippo Basile]], who was well known in Sicily for his previous [[cathedral]] restoration design in the city of [[Acireale]], as well as garden and [[villa]] designs in the city of [[Palermo]] and [[Caltagirone]]. Following G. B. F. Basile's death in 1891, construction was then overseen by his son, Architect [[Ernesto Basile]].

The Rutelli and Machì Company, represented by Giovanni [[Rutelli]] and Alberto Machì (both founding members of the company) was contracted for the main construction of the [[theatre]] which, under Architect Giovanni Rutelli's technical and building direction, went from the foundations all the way up to the theatre's attic structures. He was also responsible for all the external decorations of the building. Rutelli initially designed a steam [[tower crane]] machine which was then successfully able to lift large stone blocks and [[Greeks|Greek]]/Roman styled [[columns]] during construction of the very large theatre.

Giovanni Rutelli belongs to a very old and renowned northern Italian family of confirmed British Isles origin, a family which also includes architects and sculptor artists from the old Sicilian [[classic]] and [[baroque]] school as well as building contractors, all entrepreneurs going back to the first half of the 18th century in Palermo. Along with Architect D. [[Mario Rutelli]] (Giovanni's great-grandfather), they were considered to be among the most technically and artistically specialized experts in Sicily at that time, especially because of Mario Rutelli and his descendants' profound knowledge and experience in Ancient Greek/[[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]], as well as the [[Norman architecture|Norman architectural style]]. This style required the use of natural thick stone, all of which was part of the structural design. Some of the external decoration and one of the two very large bronze statues of lions sitting next to the theatre's monumental stairway entrance were created by Giovanni Rutelli's son, sculptor artist Sir [[Mario Rutelli]].

Construction started on 12 January 1874, but was stopped for eight years from 1882 until 1890. Finally, on 16 May 1897, twenty-two years after the laying of the foundation stone, the third largest opera house in Europe—after the [[Palais Garnier]] in [[Paris]] and the [[Vienna State Opera|K. K. Hof-Opernhaus]] in [[Vienna]]—was inaugurated with a performance of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' conducted by [[Leopoldo Mugnone]].

Busts of famous composers were carved for the theatre by the Italian sculptor, Giusto Liva (born in Montebelluna, Treviso in 1847) and several of his sons.

==Facilities and recent history==
[[File:Interior of Teatro Massimo (Palermo) SAM 0423.JPG|thumb|Interior view of the Teatro Massimo]]
The Teatro Massimo is the largest theatre in Italy. Basile was inspired by ancient and classical Sicilian architecture and, thus, the exterior was designed in the high neoclassical style incorporating elements of the Greek temples at [[Selinunte]] and [[Agrigento]]. Realized in the late-Renaissance style, the auditorium was planned for 3,000 people, but, in its current format, it seats 1,381, with 7 tiers of boxes rising up around an inclined stage, and shaped in the typical horseshoe style.

In 1974, the house was closed to complete renovations required by updated safety regulations, but cost over-runs, corruption, and political in-fighting all added to the delay and it remained closed for twenty-three years, finally re-opening on 12 May 1997, four days before its centenary. The opera season started again in 1999, although [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]'' was performed in 1998 while work in progress continued.

During the restoration regular opera seasons were performed in [[Teatro Politeama, Palermo|Teatro Politeama]], a minor building not far from Teatro Massimo. In summer a few performances, usually concerts, ballet and operetta, are held in [[Teatro della Verdura]].

In recent years, "charges of corruption and political meddling…along with budget deficits and heavy debts" have plagued the house, but, under its then part-English music director, [[Jan Latham Koenig]], it was reported that it is once again on track.&lt;ref&gt;Thicknesse, Robert, “Double espresso”, ''Opera Now'', July/August 2005. (An article on the Music Director, Jan Latham Koenig)&lt;/ref&gt;

2013-2014 was a two-year hiatus under the leadership of the comissario straordinario [[Fabio Carapezza Guttuso]], who brought in Lorenzo Amato and [[Eytan Pessen]] as artistic advisors. Under Carapezza Guttuso's leadership the theatre offered a varied programme including [[Richard Strauss]]'s [[Feuersnot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/oper-feuersnot-von-richard-strauss-liebesgruesse-aus-sizilien/9398216.html|title=Liebesgrüße aus Sizilien|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s [[Gisela!]], [[Jaromir Weinberger]]'s [[Schwanda the bagpiper]] and an increased ballet activity. The current intendant is the experienced [[Francesco Giambrone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/soldi/lavoro/2014/07/03/palermo-francesco-giambrone-nominato-sovrintendente-del-teatro-massimo_G9fnpRzquor6CtyrDLb6JO.html|title=Palermo: Francesco Giambrone nominato sovrintendente del Teatro Massimo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the musical director is [[Gabriele Ferro]].

The final scenes of the film ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' were filmed at the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/g/godfather3.html|title=Filming Locations for Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather Part 3 in New York and Sicily|first=Tony|last=Reeves|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''technical support scam''' refers to a class of [[phone fraud|telephone fraud]] activities, in which a scammer claims to offer a legitimate [[technical support]] service, often via [[cold call]]s to unsuspecting users. Such cold calls are mostly targeted at [[Microsoft Windows]] users, with the caller often claiming to represent a Microsoft technical support department.

In [[English-speaking country|English-speaking countries]] such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], such cold call scams have occurred as early as 2008&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; and primarily originate from [[call centre|call centers]] in [[India]].&lt;ref name=ars-definitelynotcalling /&gt;

The scammer will typically attempt to get the victim to allow remote access to their computer. After remote access is gained, the scammer relies on [[confidence trick]]s typically involving utilities built into Windows and other software in order to gain the victim's trust to pay for the supposed "support" services, when the scammer actually steals the victim's [[credit card]] account information, or to persuade the victim to login to Internet banking—claiming that a secure server is connected and that they cannot see the details—to receive a promised refund.

==Operation==
[[File:Tech Support Scammer Fake BSOD Virus Popup.png|thumb|Fake [[Blue Screen of Death]] [[Pop-up ad|pop-up]] tricking the victim that their computer has a "system crash" and can no longer operate safely unless they call the toll-free number to "resolve" the issues.]]
Technical support scams typically rely on [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]]. Scammers use a variety of [[confidence trick]]s to get the victim to install [[remote desktop software]], with which they take control of the victim's computer, and then use various Windows components and utilities (such as the [[Event Viewer]]), third-party utilities (such as [[rogue security software]]), and other tasks to make the victim believe that the computer has issues that need to be fixed, before proceeding for the victim to pay for "support".&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last= Arthur|first= Charles|title= Virus phone scam being run from call centres in India|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/18/phone-scam-india-call-centres|accessdate= 31 March 2014|newspaper= Guardian|date= 18 July 2012|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140328232009/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/18/phone-scam-india-call-centres|archivedate= 28 March 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mbam&gt;{{cite web|last=Segura|first=Jérôme|title=Tech Support Scams - Help &amp; Resource Page {{pipe}} Malwarebytes Unpacked|url=http://blog.malwarebytes.org/tech-support-scams/|work=Malwarebytes Corporation|accessdate=28 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328080520/http://blog.malwarebytes.org/tech-support-scams/|archivedate=28 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiation===

Technical support scams can begin in a variety of different ways.&lt;ref name=mbam/&gt;&lt;ref name=troyhunt/&gt; It most commonly begins with a [[cold calling|cold call]], usually claiming to be associated with a legitimate-sounding third-party, with a name like "Microsoft" or "Windows Technical Support",&lt;ref name=ars-definitelynotcalling/&gt; or via advertising on popular search engines such as [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] or [[Google Search|Google]], [[cybersquatting]] and/or spamming keywords related to commercial products and services that an unsuspecting user may search for (such as "Microsoft [[Live support software|live chat]]", "[[Facebook]] support", or "[[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]] login help"), and leading to web pages containing a number to be called.&lt;ref name="zdnet-bingadsban"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchengineland.com/tech-support-ads-search-still-consumer-quagmire-197905 "Despite Crackdowns, Tech Support Ads In Search Are Still Cause For Consumer Confusion"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328061606/http://searchengineland.com/tech-support-ads-search-still-consumer-quagmire-197905 |date=2015-03-28 }}. ''Search Engine Land'', Ginny Marvin on August 5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Some scams have been initiated via [[pop-up ad]]s on infected websites instructing the potential victim to call a number.

===Remote access===
The scammer instructs the victim to download and install a [[remote desktop software|remote access program]], such as [[TeamViewer]], [[LogMeIn]], [[GoToAssist]]&lt;ref ="Ars Technica"&gt;{{cite news |last= Brodkin|first= Jon|title= Fake tech support scam is trouble for legitimate remote help company|url= https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/fake-tech-support-scam-is-trouble-for-legitimate-remote-help-company/=|newspaper= Ars Technica|date= 25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[ConnectWise_Control|ConnectWise Control]] (known also as [[ScreenConnect]]), etc., and provide them with the details required to remote-control their computer using that program.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bttechnicaldepartment.screenconnect.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708163057/http://bttechnicaldepartment.screenconnect.com/|archivedate=8 July 2017|date=8 July 2017|deadurl=yes|title=Fake ConnectWise Control login purporting to be British Telecom technical department (note name of site)|website=bttechnicaldepartment.screenconnect.com|author=Technical support scammers|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confidence tricks===
{{Further|Confidence trick}}
After gaining access, the scammer attempts to convince the victim that their computer is suffering from problems that must be repaired. A number of common methods are used during many technical support scams—most of which involve misrepresenting the content and output of various Windows tools and system directories as evidence of malicious activity, such as viruses and other malware. Normally the elderly and the vulnerable will be targeted for technical support scams, or for people who aren't familiar with computers.
* The scammer may direct users to Windows' [[Event Viewer]], which displays a [[logfile|log]] of various events for use by [[system administrator]]s and expert users to troubleshoot problems. Although many of the log entries are relatively harmless notifications, the scammer may fraudulently claim that log entries labelled as warnings and errors are evidence of malware activity or that the computer is becoming corrupted, and that the errors must be "fixed".&lt;ref name=mbam/&gt;&lt;ref name=troyhunt&gt;{{cite web|last=Hunt|first=Troy|title=Scamming the scammers – catching the virus call centre scammers red-handed|url=http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/02/scamming-scammers-catching-virus-call.html|accessdate=1 April 2014|date=February 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407072126/http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/02/scamming-scammers-catching-virus-call.html|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;
* The scammer may present system folders that contain unusually named files, such as Windows' [[Prefetcher|Prefetch]] and [[temporary file|Temp]] folders, and claim that the files are evidence of malware on the system. Furthermore, the scammer may open some of these files (especially files in [[Prefetcher|Prefetch]] folder) in Notepad, which shows up as "gibberish" characters known as [[Mojibake]]. The scammer claims that malware has "corrupted" these files. In reality, most of the files in Prefetch are binary files (which can not be displayed properly using Notepad) which speed up certain operations.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web|last=Solon|first=Olivia|title=What happens if you play along with a Microsoft 'tech support' scam?|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-04/11/malwarebytes|work=Wired.co.uk|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=11 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107234041/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-04/11/malwarebytes|archivedate=7 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scammer may misuse [[Command Prompt]] tools to generate suspicious-looking output, for instance, the &lt;code&gt;[[tree (command)|tree]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;dir /s&lt;/code&gt; command, which displays a listing of files and [[directory (computing)|directories]]. The scammer may claim the innocuous program to be a [[malware scanner]], and manually enter text purporting to be an [[error message]] (such as "security breach ... trojans found") after the conclusion of the output, or into a blank notepad document.&lt;ref name=b2c&gt;{{cite web|last=Lodhi|first=Nauman|title=Beware of Microsoft Tech Support Scammers|url=http://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/beware-microsoft-tech-support-scammers-0755581|work=[[Business 2 Community]]|accessdate=18 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419020522/http://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/beware-microsoft-tech-support-scammers-0755581|archivedate=19 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scammer may misrepresent values and keys stored in the [[Windows Registry]] as being malicious, such as innocuous keys whose values are listed as not being set.&lt;ref name=mbam/&gt;
* The "[[special folder#File system directories|Send To]]" function on Windows is associated with a [[globally unique identifier]]. The output of the command &lt;code&gt;assoc&lt;/code&gt;, which lists all [[file association]]s on the system, displays this association with the line &lt;code&gt;ZFSendToTarget=CLSID\{888DCA60-FC0A-11CF-8F0F-00C04FD7D062}&lt;/code&gt;; this GUID is the same on all versions of Windows. The scammer may claim that this is a unique ID used to identify the user's computer, or claim that the "CLSID" listed is actually a "Computer Licence Security ID" that must be renewed.&lt;ref name=eset-clsid&gt;{{cite web|title=Support desk scams: CLSID not unique|url=http://www.welivesecurity.com/2011/07/19/support-desk-scams-clsid-not-unique/|website=WeLiveSecurity|publisher=ESET|accessdate=15 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023115759/http://www.welivesecurity.com/2011/07/19/support-desk-scams-clsid-not-unique/|archivedate=23 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eset-tricks&gt;{{cite web|title=Support-Scammer Tricks|url=http://www.welivesecurity.com/2011/11/30/support-scammer-tricks/|website=WeLiveSecurity|publisher=ESET|accessdate=15 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225144746/http://www.welivesecurity.com/2011/11/30/support-scammer-tricks/|archivedate=25 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scammer may also claim that the system's "problems" are a result of "expired" [[warranty|warranties]] on its hardware or software, for example, Windows Product Keys and coax the victim into paying for a "renewal".&lt;ref name=troyhunt/&gt;&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;
* The scammer may run the obscure [[Syskey]] utility and configure a startup password known only to them, thereby locking the victim out of their own system after the computer is rebooted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodchipcomputers.co.uk/index.php?PageID=msscam Woodchip computers:Have you been caught by the "I am Windows Support" scam?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108201553/http://www.woodchipcomputers.co.uk/index.php?PageID=msscam |date=2014-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kerbsonsecurity"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holzman|first1=Carey|title='Microsoft Partner' Claims Fuel Support Scams|url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/11/microsoft-partner-claims-fuel-support-scams/|accessdate=26 July 2016|agency=Kerbs on Security|date=14 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925183046/https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/11/microsoft-partner-claims-fuel-support-scams/|archivedate=25 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The scammer may have a [[keylogger]] installed on their computer and may successfully change the users account password and/or create a PIN number if the victims computer runs on [[Windows 10]] because Windows 10 computers no longer have the [[Syskey]] utility, therefore locking the victim out of their computer as soon as it reboots.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Jim Browning|title=This is why you never let anyone remotely access your computer|date=2018-08-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oot9FCuUOSo|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scammer may delete Windows critical files and folders such as System32, making the computer unusable until the operating system has been reinstalled.
* The scammer may block the user from viewing their screen, pretend that this is the result of malware, and use the time to search the user's files for sensitive information or attempt to break into the user's accounts with stolen or stored credentials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''The Lombardi Curse''' was an alleged [[sports-related curses|sports-related curse]] that supposedly prevented the [[National Football League]] (NFL)'s [[Philadelphia Eagles]] franchise from winning the [[Super Bowl]] for as long as the game's [[Vince Lombardi Trophy|trophy]] is named after [[Vince Lombardi]].{{fact|date=February 2018}} Its origin is traced to the Eagles upsetting the [[Green Bay Packers]] in the [[1960 NFL Championship Game]]. This game ended up being the lone playoff defeat in Lombardi's coaching career as his Packers would go on to establish a dynasty that would win five NFL championships in the next seven seasons, including the [[Super Bowl I|first]] [[Super Bowl II|two]] Super Bowls.

Meanwhile, the Eagles had not won another league championship since, including having never won the Super Bowl since the game started being played annually in 1966. They appeared in [[Super Bowl XV]] in the 1980 season and [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] in the 2004 season, but lost both times. In 1970, the Super Bowl trophy was officially named the Vince Lombardi trophy when the league decided to honor Lombardi by naming the trophy after him following his death in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weatherly|first=Kaleel|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2017/2/5/14515842/vince-lombardi-trophy-nfl-championship-super-bowl|title=Why is the Lombardi Trophy named after Vince Lombardi?|website=[[SB Nation]]|date=February 5, 2017|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This renaming of the Super Bowl trophy combined with the Eagles inability to win the championship game has led some Eagles fans to believe that the franchise is cursed by Vince Lombardi; that beating Lombardi meant never winning the trophy named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDkpDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT14&amp;lpg=PT14&amp;dq=eagles+lombardi+curse&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3jd2qN3Dlx&amp;sig=Ta6DzH1Ia7nv6QgicJpnjq0ILvY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifw_XZ6ZPVAhUCND4KHYKACjAQ6AEIVTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=eagles+lombardi+curse&amp;f=false|title=Big 50: Philadelphia Eagles: The Men and Moments that Made the Philadelphia Eagles|first=Mark|last=Eckel|date=15 September 2016|publisher=Triumph Books|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eagles defeated the [[New England Patriots]] by a score of 41 to 33 in [[Super Bowl LII]] at [[U.S. Bank Stadium]] in [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]] on February 4, 2018, ending the alleged curse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wesseling|first=Chris|title=Philadelphia Eagles knock off Patriots, win Super Bowl|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000914459/article/philadelphia-eagles-knock-off-patriots-win-super-bowl|publisher=National Football League|date=February 4, 2018|accessdate=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cormier|first=Ryan|title=Three generations of Delaware family kiss Lombardi Trophy|url=https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2018/02/05/three-generations-delaware-family-kiss-lombardi-trophy/306533002/|publisher=The News Journal|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In 1958, the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] offered and nearly hired [[Vince Lombardi]] to be their head coach after having served as the offensive coordinator for the [[New York Giants]], but after some discussion he refused it in the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Frank|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/20150131_How_Lombardi_almost_became_Eagles_coach.html|title=How Lombardi almost became Eagles coach|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=January 31, 2015|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eagles were reportedly not happy with 
his decision.&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://brokenbellsports.wordpress.com/category/are-the-philadelphia-eagles-cursed-by-vince-lombardi/|title=Are the Philadelphia Eagles Cursed by Vince Lombardi? – BrokenBellSports|website=brokenbellsports.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eagles hired [[Buck Shaw]] as their head coach later that offseason. After spending an additional season with the Giants, Lombardi would go on to become head coach for the [[Green Bay Packers]] in 1959.

On December 26, 1960, the Eagles defeated Lombardi and the Packers 17–13 in the [[1960 NFL Championship Game]]. While the Eagles organization celebrated the victory over the man who had turned them down two years earlier, Lombardi did not take the loss kindly, and it is said that the loss is what drove him for the rest of his coaching career.&lt;ref name="wordpress.com"/&gt; He took the blame for the loss and reportedly told his team after the game that "We'll never lose another championship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Longman|first=Jeré|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/sports/football/07eagles.html|title=Eagles’ 1960 Victory Was an N.F.L. Turning Point|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 7, 2011|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lombardi would fulfill his promise, as the Packers went 9–0 with Lombardi in the playoffs since that defeat, winning five championships which included the first two Super Bowls. 

Meanwhile, the Eagles did not win another championship for 57 years, the [[List of NFL franchise post-season droughts#Super Bowl win droughts|third longest]] active title drought among all NFL franchises after the [[Arizona Cardinals]] and [[Detroit Lions]].  
In 1970, Lombardi passed away following a battle with cancer, and the league decided to honor him by naming the Super Bowl trophy after him. While there are no reports that Lombardi has said anything that would suggest he placed a curse on the Eagles, some{{whom|date=August 2017}} Eagles fans believed the franchise was cursed to never win the Super Bowl for as long as the game's trophy was named after the man they handed his lone playoff defeat to.

'''Théâtre Hébertot''' {{IPA-fr|te.ɑtʁ e.bɛʁ.to|}} is a theatre at 78, boulevard des Batignolles, in the [[17th arrondissement of Paris]], France. The theatre, completed in 1838 and opening as the '''Théâtre des Batignolles''', was later renamed '''Théâtre des Arts''' in 1907. It acquired its present name in 1940 after [[playwright]] and journalist [[Jacques Hébertot]].

Théâtre Hébertot has a seating capacity of 630 for the main stage, and completed construction on a smaller stage, l'Petit Hébertot, in 2001. The Hebertot is one of the few Paris theaters that has shows in English as well as French.

Danièle and Pierre Franck are its current directors.

'''Triplemanía V-B''' was the second part of the fifth [[Triplemanía]] [[professional wrestling]] show promoted by [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]]. 1997 was fourth year to feature the "Triplemanía Series" of shows with two, referred to as V-A and V-B, where this was the second and final of the series. The show took place on June 15, 1997 in Naulcalpan, Mexico. The main event featured an [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|eight-man "Atómicos" tag-team match]] between the teams of [[Perro Aguayo]], [[Octagón]], [[Cibernético]] and [[El Canek]] and [[Jake Roberts]], [[Gorgeous George III]], El Cobarde Jr. and [[Fuerza Guerrera]].

==Production==
===Background===
In early 1992 [[Antonio Peña]] was working as a booker and storyline writer for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion, and was frustrated by CMLL's very conservative approach to ''[[lucha libre]]''. He joined forced with a number of younger, very talented wrestlers who felt like CMLL was not giving them the recognition they deserved and decided to split from CMLL to create [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]], later known simply as "AAA"  or Triple A. After making a deal with the ''Televisa'' television network AAA held their first show in April 1992.&lt;ref name=SLOrbit&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2006/10/07/el-fin-de-una-era/| title= El fin de una era| date= October 7, 2006 | accessdate= October 14, 2009 | author= Ocampo, Ernesto | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Peña and AAA held their first [[Triplemanía]] event, building it into an annual event that would become AAA's [[Super Bowl]] event, similar to the [[WWE]]'s [[WrestleMania]] being the biggest show of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages=128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 Triplemanía was the fifth year in a row AAA held a Triplemanía show and the twelfth overall show under the Triplemanía banner.

===Storylines===
The Triplemanía V-B show featured eight [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

==Allegations of bribery==
In 2010 Unaoil entered into an agreement with [[CIMIC Group|Leighton Holdings]] with the aim of securing a $500 million oil pipeline contract in Iraq. In 2011 Leighton Holdings referred the deal to the police as corruption.&lt;ref name=smh2013/&gt; In 2014 a UK High Court judge queried the corruption claims after Unaoil denied them in a civil litigation matter involving Leighton Holidngs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/companies/leighton-corruption-evidence-at-best-tenuous-uk-judge-says/news-story/e3851477f3a2e7e00551c5d31b9f3ad5 |title= Leighton corruption evidence ‘at best tenuous’, UK judge says |work= The Australian |first= Damon |last= Kitney |date= 2015-03-10 |accessdate= 2016-04-01}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the UK [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] alleged before the UK High Court in a separate case brought by Unaoil that the firm was engaged in "extensive" corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/dec/01/monaco-oil-firm-starts-legal-action-against-serious-office|title=Monaco oil firm starts legal action against Serious Fraud Office|last=Evans|first=Rob|date=2016-12-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-12|last2=Pegg|first2=David|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unaoil's litigation, in which it alleged the SFO had acted unlwafully, was dismissed by the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-court-unaoil-sfo-idUKKBN1702JS|title=UK court dismisses Unaoil case against anti-fraud agency|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=Reuters UK|access-date=2017-07-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the SFO began investigating allegations Unaoil acting corruptly in facilitating business deals involving [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls Royce]], [[KBR (company)|Halliburton-KBR]], [[Petrofac]], [[ABB Group|ABB]], Leighton Holdings and Amec Foster Wheeler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d67341f6-6665-11e7-8526-7b38dcaef614|title=Amec Foster Wheeler Shares drop 10 per cent on SFO probe|last=Thomas|first=Natalie|date=|website=Financial Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, KBR, [[FMC Technologies]] and [[Core Laboratories|Core Labs]] all disclosed in 2016 that they had been contacted by the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] in connection with a DOJ probe of Unaoil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/890990/swiss-engineering-co-admits-improper-unaoil-payments|title=Swiss Engineering Co. Admits Improper Unaoil Payments - Law360|website=www.law360.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SFO and DOJ inquiries followed media reports that Unaoil allegedly facilitated extensive corruption and bribery in the [[oil industry]].&lt;ref name="AgeMar30Comp"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/interactive/2016/the-bribe-factory/day-1/the-company-that-bribed-the-world.html|title=The Bribe Factory: Part 1|date=2016-03-30|work= [[The Age]]|first1= Nick |last1= McKenzie |first2= Richard |last2= Baker |first3=Michael |last3= Bachelard |first4= Daniel |last4= Quinlan |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leaked cache of Unaoil internal company emails dating from 2001 to 2012 were the subject of a series of articles published by [[Fairfax Media]] investigative reporters [[Nick McKenzie]], Richard Baker and Michael Bachelard in the Australian newspaper ''[[The Age]]'', and ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' in March 2016. Under headlines such as "Unaoil: World's Biggest Bribe Scandal"&lt;ref name="AgeMar30Comp" /&gt; and "Unaoil: Company that Bribed the World",&lt;ref name="AgeMar30Comp" /&gt; ''The Age'' wrote that "How they make their money is simple. Oil-rich countries often suffer poor governance and high levels of corruption. Unaoil's business plan is to play on the fears of large Western companies that they cannot win contracts without its help. Its operatives then bribe officials in oil-producing nations to help these clients win government-funded projects. The corrupt officials might rig a tender committee. Or leak inside information. Or ensure a contract is awarded without a competitive tender".&lt;ref name="AgeMar30Comp" /&gt;

In Iraq, Unaoil was alleged to have paid "multi-million dollar lump sums" to senior politicians. Other oil producing countries that Unaoil have operated in include Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Kuwait, and the UAE.&lt;ref name="AgeMar30Comp" /&gt;

In March 2016 ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' published a letter from a legal representative of Unaoil in which the allegations of corruption and bribery are denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.smh.com.au/national/how-bribe-factory-unaoil-tried-to-stop-us-telling-their-secrets-20160331-gnutfc.html |title= How bribe factory Unaoil tried to stop us telling their secrets |work= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |first= Michael |last= Bachelard |date= 2016-03-31 |accessdate= 2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2016, Monaco authorities announced that they had raided the offices of Unaoil and the homes of some of its executives, following an urgent request for assistance from the UK's [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]]. The statement said, "These searches and interviews were carried out in the presence of British officials as part of a vast, international corruption scandal implicating numerous foreign oil industry firms. The information collected is going to be examined by the British authorities as part of their investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/01/authorities-monaco-raid-oil-firm-unaoil-hq-corruption-investigation |title= Authorities in Monaco raid oil firm HQ in corruption investigation |work= [[The Guardian]] |first= Kevin |last= Rawlinson |date= 2016-04-01 |accessdate= 2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Crime Agency|UK National Crime Agency]] carried out their investigation in collaboration with the [[Australian Federal Police]] and the [[FBI|U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-justice-department-unaoil_us_56fca3bbe4b0a06d5804cbae |title= FBI And Justice Department Probing Huge International Bribery Scandal |work= [[Huffington Post]] |first1= Nick |last1= McKenzie |first2= Richard |last2= Baker |first3=Michael |last3= Bachelard |first4= Daniel |last4= Quinlan |date= 2016-03-31 |accessdate= 2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February 2017, an article in the [[News Corp]]-owned ''[[The Australian]]'' presented an alternative perspective on the Unaoil bribery scandal.&lt;ref name=TheAustFeb27Comp&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/fairfaxs-pain-just-beginning-as-unaoil-stories-keep-taking/news-story/bbb249c15bf00f305744a60d9ef91a54|title=Fairfax’s pain just beginning as Unaoil stories keep taking
|date=2017-02-27|work= [[The Australian]]|first1= Chris |last1= Merritt |accessdate=2017-03-18}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This claimed that the Fairfax Media newspapers had settled claims made against them regarding false allegations and indicated that "within weeks, the publisher will be confronted with yet another legal action, this time from the company at the centre of the allegations that triggered these backdowns. That company is Unaoil, a Monaco-based business that is a player in the international oil industry and is owned by the Ashani family."  The article claimed that the leaker of the company emails was an extortionist who had hacked Unaoil, and stated that Unaoil would seek through court to identify the sources for the 2016 articles.  ''[[The Australian]]'' had previously reported Unaoil's denials of the allegations, and accusation that it was the victim of extortion, on 17 May 2016.&lt;ref name=TheAustMay17Comp&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/unaoil-denies-media-claims-of-corruption/news-story/840ea2a1e790616ad643aac57b9229c5?nk=855e6f8221a9f4da7f7ce9a5b1ae1234-1489803463|title=Unaoil denies media claims of corruption
|date=2016-05-17|work= [[The Australian]] |accessdate=2017-03-18}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither of these articles suggested that the content of the leaked emails upon which the earlier allegations had been based was inaccurate or forged.

In November 2016, the [[HM Treasury|UK Treasury]] announced it was giving the SFO 'blockbuster funding' to resource the agency's Unaoil probe. That same month, a former Unaoil country manager told the [[Panorama (TV series)|BBC's Panorama]] programme he had bribed a Libyan government official. The whistleblower, Lindsay Mitchell, said that in 2009 he handed an envelope filled with US dollars to a manager at a subsidiary of the state-owned Libyan National Oil Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/nov/01/serious-office-given-extra-funds-to-investigate-unaoil-bribery-claims|title=Serious Fraud Office given extra funds to investigate Unaoil bribery claims|last=Pegg|first=David|date=2016-11-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-12|last2=Evans|first2=Rob|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Watt|first3=Holly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the DOJ announced in a [https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/rolls-royce-plc-agrees-pay-170-million-criminal-penalty-resolve-foreign-corrupt-practices-act statement] that [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls Royce]] had agreed to pay a $170 million fine to settle corruption allegations involving its use of several facilitators to win contracts, including Unaoil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/rolls-royce-plc-agrees-pay-170-million-criminal-penalty-resolve-foreign-corrupt-practices-act|title=Rolls-Royce plc Agrees to Pay $170 Million Criminal Penalty to Resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Case|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption charges laid by Serious Fraud Office ===
On November 17 2017, the Serious Fraud Office charged two former Unaoil Iraq managers with conspiring to pay bribes to win Dutch company SBM Offshore contracts in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/nov/16/serious-office-charges-two-unaoil-executives-with-bribery|title=Serious Fraud Office charges two Unaoil executives with bribery|last=Watt|first=Holly|date=2017-11-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-17|last2=Evans|first2=Rob|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Pegg|first3=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iraq officials allegedly bribed were not named.

The '''War of the Two Capitals''' ({{zh|t=兩都之戰|s=两都之战}}) was a [[civil war]] that occurred in 1328 under the [[Yuan dynasty]] based in [[China]]. It was a [[war of succession]] fought between the forces based in the Yuan capital [[Khanbaliq]] (Dadu, modern [[Beijing]]) and the forces based in the [[summer capital]] [[Shangdu]] after the death of Yuan emperor [[Yesün Temür (Yuan dynasty)|Yesün Temür]] in Shangdu. The clash between the two groups was the bloodiest and most destructive succession in all Yuan history. The War of the Two Capitals was less about ideology and more a struggle to advance individual family interests through political alliances and military strength.&lt;ref&gt;[[David M. Robinson]], ''Empire's Twilight: Northeast Asia Under the Mongols'', page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; It ended with victory for the Khanbaliq group, but it took a few years for the last remnants of its opponents to give up.

==Background==
In 1323, when [[Gegeen Khan|Shidebala Gegeen Khan]] (Emperor Yingzong) was assassinated by Grand Censor [[Tegshi]] and Esen Temur, the rebellious group welcomed Yesün Temür as the new ruler. The death of Yesün Temür Khan in [[Shangdu]] five years later in August 1328 gave the line of Khayishan [[Külüg Khan]] (Emperor Wuzong) an opportunity to surface. The designated heir, Yesün Temü's son [[Ragibagh Khan|Ragibagh]], was installed by the powerful [[Muslim]] officer and Yesün Temür's favorite retainer [[Dawlat Shah]] at the summer palace in Shangdu in the next month. At the main capital in Khanbaliq (Dadu, modern [[Beijing]]), however, bold action was taken to restore the throne to the sons of Khayishan, either [[Khutughtu Khan Kusala|Kusala]] (the father of the last Yuan ruler [[Toghon Temür]]) or [[Jayaatu Khan Tugh Temür|Tugh Temür]] (who was cooling his heels in [[South China]]).&lt;ref&gt;David M. Robinson, ''Empire's Twilight: Northeast Asia Under the Mongols'', page 39.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was mainly due to the political ingenuity of [[El Temür]], whose [[Qipchaq]] family reached its zenith under Khayishan. He activated a conspiracy in the capital Khanbaliq to overthrow the court at Shangdu. He and his entourages enjoyed enormous geographical and economic advantages over the loyalists of Yesün Temür. Tugh Temür was recalled to Khanbaliq by El Temür since his more influential brother Kuśala stayed in far-away [[Central Asia]] at the time. He was installed as the new ruler in Khanbaliq in September at about the same time Ragibagh succeeded to the throne in Shangdu. Not everyone who participated in the movement had ties as close as El Temür's to Khayishan's family.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Franke, Denis Twitchett, John King Fairbank, ''The Cambridge History of China: Alien regimes and border states, 907–1368'', page 542.&lt;/ref&gt; The restorationists under El Temür had the extensive human and material resources of the Central Region (under [[Zhongshu Sheng]]), [[Hunan]], [[Jiangzhe Province|Jiangzhe]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Huguang]] provinces whereas the loyalists at Shangdu had the support of only [[Lingbei province|Lingbei]], [[Liaoyang province|Liaoyang]], [[Shaanxi]], [[Sichuan]] and [[Yunnan]], all of which were geographically peripheral.&lt;ref&gt;Dardess-Conquerors and Confucians, pp.39–42&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Mongolian princes and high-ranking Mongolian officials based in [[Manchuria]] (Liaodong) and eastern [[Mongolia]] fought on both sides of this civil war.

==The war==
At the start of the war, Ragibagh's forces broke through the [[Great Wall]] at several points, and penetrated as far as the outskirts of Khanbaliq. El Temür, however, was able to turn the tide quickly in his favor. The restorationists from Manchuria and eastern Mongolia launched a surprise attack on the loyalists. Their army under the command of Bukha Temur and Orlug Temur, descendants of [[Genghis Khan]]'s brothers, surrounded Shangdu on 14 November, at a time most of the loyalists were involved on the Great Wall front.&lt;ref&gt;Yuan shi, 32, pp.605&lt;/ref&gt; The loyalists in Shangdu surrendered on the very next day, and Dawlat Shah and most of the leading loyalists were taken prisoner and later executed. Ragibagh was reported to be missing.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick W. Mote, ''Imperial China 900–1800'', page 471.&lt;/ref&gt; With the surrender of Shangdu, the way to restoring Khayishan's imperial line was cleared.

However, the loyalists elsewhere carried on fighting for much longer. Indeed, the loyalists in Shanxi did not lay down their arms until December 1328, and their counterparts in Sichuan surrendered only in the following month.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Franke, Denis Twitchett, John King Fairbank ''The Cambridge History of China: Alien regimes and border states, 907–1368'', page 544.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the next year there was a revolt in Yunnan, where the Prince Tugel declared himself independent. Troops were sent against him, and were ordered to march by the country of Pa fan. With the support of the [[Yunnan#Ethnicity|province's aboriginal tribes]], such as the Lolos and other tribes of Miaotze on the borders of Yunnan, Tugel successfully resisted the imperial army. The Yuan army under the command of Temur Buka was defeated, and sent for reinforcements. At that point the Prince Yuntu Temur was ordered to withdraw 20,000 men from the provinces of Jiangzhe, Jiangxi and Henan Jiangbei, and to lead them by way of Huguang towards Yunnan.&lt;ref&gt;Yuan shi, 31, pp.697&lt;/ref&gt; The last remnants of the loyalists did not give up their cause until 1332.
