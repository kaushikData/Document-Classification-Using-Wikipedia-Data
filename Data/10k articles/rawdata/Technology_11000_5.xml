In [[computing]], '''AoS and SoA''' refer to contrasting ways to arrange a sequence of [[record (computer science)|record]]s in [[Memory (computing)|memory]], with regard to [[interleaving (data)|interleaving]], and are of interest in [[SIMD]] programming.

== Structure of arrays ==
'''Structure of arrays''' (or '''SoA''') is a layout separating elements of a [[record (computer science)|record]] (or 'struct' in the [[C programming language]]) into one [[parallel array]] per [[field (computer science)|field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=how to manipulate data structure to optimize memory use|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/how-to-manipulate-data-structure-to-optimize-memory-use-on-32-bit-intel-architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motivation is easier manipulation with packed [[SIMD instruction]]s in most [[instruction set architecture]]s, since a single [[SIMD register]] can load [[homogeneous data]], possibly transferred by a wide [[internal datapath]] (e.g. [[128-bit]]). If only a specific part of the record is needed, only those parts need to be iterated over, allowing more data to fit onto a single cache line. The downside is requiring more [[cache way]]s when traversing data, and inefficient [[indexed addressing]].  (see also: [[planar image format]])

== Array of structures ==
'''Array of structure'''s (or '''AoS''') is the opposite (and more conventional) layout, in which data for different fields is interleaved. 
This is often more intuitive, and supported directly by most [[programming languages]].

== Example ==

Here is an example of the two layouts written in [[C++]]:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="cpp"&gt;
struct Point {
	int x;
	int y;
};

/* Array of structures approach */
//Each struct contains information about an individual ball.
struct Ball {
	Point position;
	Point velocity;
	std::string name;
};

std::vector&lt;Ball&gt; balls;

//Updating is as simple as looping over the array of balls.
void update_positions(std::vector&lt;Ball&gt;&amp; bs) {
	for(auto&amp; b : bs) {
		b.position.x += b.velocity.x;
		b.position.y += b.velocity.y;
	}
}

//If we only care about a particular attribute (in this case, the name) we
//have to load the entire ball into the function, which would be wasteful.
void print_names(const std::vector&lt;Ball&gt;&amp; bs) {
	for(auto&amp; b : bs) {
		std::cout &lt;&lt; b.name &lt;&lt; '\n';
	}
}

/* Structure of arrays approach */
//The struct consists of arrays of each particular attribute of the ball.
struct Balls {
	int n_balls;
	std::vector&lt;Point&gt; positions;
	std::vector&lt;Point&gt; velocities;
	std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; names;
};

//To iterate over the structure of arrays, we have to iterate over each of the 
//relevant arrays.
void update_positions(Balls&amp; bs) {
	for(int i = 0; i &lt; bs.n_balls; ++i) {
		//Retrieve the information of the ball at this index
		auto *c_position = &amp;bs.positions[i];
		auto *c_velocity = &amp;bs.velocities[i];
		//Do stuff with it
		c_position-&gt;x += c_velocity-&gt;x;
		c_position-&gt;y += c_velocity-&gt;y;
	}
};

//If we only care about a particular attribute, we only have to load the 
//relevant arrays, and nothing else.
void print_names(const Balls&amp; bs) {
	for(int i = 0; i &lt; bs.n_balls; ++i) {
		auto *c_name = bs.names[i];
		std::cout &lt;&lt; *c_name &lt;&lt; '\n';
	}
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Alternatives ==
A hybrid approach is possible, e.g. de-interleaving a number of objects that correspond to the number of [[SIMD lanes]].

It is also possible to split some subset of a structure (rather than each individual field) into a [[parallel array]]{{snd}} this can actually improve [[locality of reference]] if different pieces of fields are used at different times in the program (see [[data oriented design]]).

Some [[SIMD]] architectures provide [[strided load/store instruction]]s to load homogeneous data from SoA format. Yet another option used in some [[Cell (microprocessor)|CELL]] libraries is to de-interleave data from AoS format when loading sources into registers, and interleave when writing out results (facilitated by [[superscalar issue]] of [[Permute instruction|permute]]s). Some [[Glossary of computer graphics#vector maths library|vector maths libraries]] align [[floating point]] 4D vectors with the SIMD register to leverage the associated data path and instructions, whilst still providing programmer convenience, although this does not scale to SIMD units wider than four lanes.

In the [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] [[stream processing]] model, SoA layout is generally not required, as they provide true [[vector addressing]].

== 4D vectors ==
AOS vs SOA presents a choice when considering 3D or 4D vector data on machines with 4-lane SIMD hardware. SIMD ISAs are usually designed for homogeneous data, however some provide a [[dot product]] instruction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=intel SSE4 dot product|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/583111}}&lt;/ref&gt; and additional permutes making the AOS case easier to handle. As of 2016, most [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]s have moved away from 4D instructions to scalar [[Single Instruction Multiple Threads|SIMT]] pipelines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=modern GPU arch (see scalar unified pipelines)|url=ftp://download.nvidia.com/developer/cuda/seminar/TDCI_Arch.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; for better performance for [[compute kernel]]s.

== Software support ==
Most languages support the AOS format more naturally by combining records and various array [[abstract data types]]. The experimental [[JAI (programming language)|JAI programming language]] is a recent attempt to provide language level SOA support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data oriented demo:SOA,composition|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHqFrNyLlpA}} Demonstration of data-oriented and SOA features in the JAI language, also explaining the motivation.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]] language, supports multi-dimensional arrays, with AOS, or SOA (through a package).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3244">An '''advance ship notice''' or '''advance shipping notice''' (ASN) is a notification of pending deliveries, similar to a packing list.  It is usually sent in an electronic format and is a common [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]] document.  In the EDI [[ASC X12|X12]] system, it is known as the EDI 856 document and the [[EDIFACT]] equivalent is the DESADV (Dispatch Advice) message.  The ASN can be used to list the contents of a shipment of goods as well as additional information relating to the shipment, such as order information, product description, physical characteristics, type of packaging, markings, carrier information, and configuration of goods within the transportation equipment. The ASN enables the sender to describe the contents and configuration of a shipment in various levels of detail and provides an ordered flexibility to convey information.&lt;ref&gt;UCC: "Guidelines for EDI", page 856.005010.441. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The ASN is noteworthy in that it is a new concept in logistics, enabled by the advance of modern communication methods.  Although it provides information similar to the [[Bill of lading]], its function is very different.  While the [[Bill of lading]] is meant to accompany a load on its path, the goal of the ASN is to provide information to the destination's receiving operations well in advance of delivery.  This tends to impact the logistics stream in three areas: cost, accuracy, and flexibility.&lt;ref name="SupplyChainDigest"&gt;SupplyChainDigest, September 17, 2010, 'ASNs and the Supply Chain'&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''Cost'''.  Modern receiving operations rarely have time to break down a shipping unit (carton or pallet) and identify its components, depending instead on quick scans of barcodes on shipping labels.  An ASN can provide a list of all of the barcoded ID numbers of the shipping units and the contents of each.  Receiving costs are thought to be reduced by about 40%.&lt;ref name="SupplyChainDigest" /&gt; 

'''Accuracy'''.  Upon receipt of the ASN, the receiver is immediately informed of any difference between what was expected, and what has actually been shipped.

'''Flexibility'''.  Knowing the actual fill rates of the orders gives the receiver the opportunity to re-allocate goods in subsequent shipments.

'''ASN and finance''' 
The ASN can be used to pay suppliers directly for goods received. This can be accomplished by receiving the ASN into the company computer system (ERP), printing company labels for each container received, affixing the labels on the containers, and then transmitting any discrepancies to the supplier via EDI.&lt;ref&gt;Materials Management, An Executive's Supply Chain Guide-Wiley Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different approaches in Alzheimer's disease research. One approach is to reduce [[amyloid beta]], for example with [[bapineuzumab]], an antibody in phase III studies for patients in mild to moderate stage; [[semagacestat]], a γ-[[secretase]] inhibitor, [[MPC-7869]]; and [[UB-311]], [[ACC-001]] or [[CAD106]], vaccines against amyloid beta. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, like [[AL-108]] (phase II completed); or metal-protein interaction attenuation, as is the case of [[PBT2]] (phase II completed). Yet another approach is to use general cognitive enhancers, as may be the case for [[memantine]], a pharmaceutical approved in the United States and European Union to treat symptoms of moderate-to-severe AD. In animals, ultrasound has been used for penetrating the blood-brain barrier and activating microglial cells to eliminate amyloid beta and restored memory function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Underwood|first1=Emily | name-list-format = vanc |title=Ultrasound therapies target brain cancers and Alzheimer’s disease|journal=Science|date=11 March 2015|doi=10.1126/science.aab0302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, there are basic investigations on the origin and mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease.

==Treatments in clinical development==

Several potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease are under investigation, including several compounds being studied in [[Clinical trial#Phases|phase 3]] clinical trials.  The most important clinical research is focused on potentially treating the underlying disease pathology, for which reduction of [[amyloid beta]] is a common target of compounds under investigation.

=== Immunotherapy to amyloid beta ===

[[Immunotherapy]] or [[vaccination]] for Alzheimer's stimulates the immune system to attack beta-amyloid. One approach is active immunization, which would stimulate a permanent immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dodel R, Neff F, Noelker C, Pul R, Du Y, Bacher M, Oertel W | title = Intravenous immunoglobulins as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease: rationale and current evidence | journal = Drugs | volume = 70 | issue = 5 | pages = 513–28 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20329802 | doi = 10.2165/11533070-000000000-00000 | url = http://adisonline.com/drugs/Abstract/2010/70050/Intravenous_Immunoglobulins_as_a_Treatment_for.1.aspx | access-date = 2010-03-27 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110917191608/http://adisonline.com/drugs/Abstract/2010/70050/Intravenous_Immunoglobulins_as_a_Treatment_for.1.aspx | archive-date = 2011-09-17 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vaccine AN-1792 showed promise in mouse and early human trials, but in a 2002 Phase II trial, 6% of subjects (18 of 300) developed serious brain inflammation resembling [[meningoencephalitis]], and the trial was stopped. In long-term followups, 20% of subjects had developed high levels of antibodies to beta-amyloid. While placebo-patients and non-antibody responders worsened, these antibody-responders showed a degree of stability in cognitive levels as assessed by the neuropsychological test battery (although not by other measures), and had lower levels of the protein tau in their cerebrospinal fluid. These results may suggest reduced disease activity in the antibody-responder group. Autopsies found that immunization resulted in clearance of amyloid plaques, but did not prevent progressive neurodegeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Vaccination:

====Passive immunotherapy====

Also derived from the AN-1792 immunotherapy program, there is an infused antibody approach termed a passive vaccine in that it does not invoke the immune system and would require regular infusions to maintain the artificial antibody levels. [[Cerebral hemorrhage|Micro-cerebral hemorrhages]] may be a threat to this process.

[[Bapineuzumab]], an antibody to amyloid-β, was previously being developed; however, the drug failed in phase 3 clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pfizer-alzheimers-idUSBRE8751F120120807|title=Pfizer, J&amp;J scrap Alzheimer's studies as drug fails|date=2012-08-07|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antibody was designed as essentially identical to the natural antibody triggered by the earlier AN-1792 vaccine.

A recent study showed FDA-approved cancer drugs, [[Programmed cell death protein 1|PD-1]] inhibitors, may benefit patients with Alzheimer's disease. The study used a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and an antibody against PD-1 to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in amyloid-β plaques and improved cognitive performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baruch K, Deczkowska A, Rosenzweig N, Tsitsou-Kampeli A, Sharif AM, Matcovitch-Natan O, Kertser A, David E, Amit I, Schwartz M | title = PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade reduces pathology and improves memory in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–7 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26779813 | doi = 10.1038/nm.4022 | url = http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v22/n2/full/nm.4022.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Targeting the production of amyloid beta peptide ===

====Gamma secretase inhibition====

[[Gamma secretase]] is a protein complex thought to be a fundamental building block in the development of the amyloid beta peptide. A gamma secretase inhibitor, [[semagacestat]], failed to show any benefit to Alzheimer's disease patients in clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pharmatimes.com/Article/10-08-18/Lilly_hit_by_spectacular_failure_of_Phase_III_Alzheimer_s_candidate.aspx#ixzz3TtbavMrc | title = Lilly hit by spectacular failure of Phase III Alzheimer’s candidate | publisher = PharmaTimes | date = August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gamma secretase modulation====

[[R-flurbiprofen|Tarenflurbil]] (MPC-7869, formerly R-flubiprofen) is a [[gamma secretase]] modulator sometimes called a selective amyloid beta 42 lowering agent. It is believed to reduce the production of the toxic amyloid beta in favor of shorter forms of the peptide.&lt;ref&gt;Tarenflurbil:

===Metal-protein interaction attenuation===

PBT2 is an 8-hydroxy quinoline that removes copper and zinc from cerebrospinal fluid, which are held to be necessary catalysts for amyloid beta aggregation.&lt;ref name="pmid18068270"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strozyk D, Launer LJ, Adlard PA, Cherny RA, Tsatsanis A, Volitakis I, Blennow K, Petrovitch H, White LR, Bush AI | title = Zinc and copper modulate Alzheimer Abeta levels in human cerebrospinal fluid | journal = Neurobiology of Aging | volume = 30 | issue = 7 | pages = 1069–77 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 18068270 | pmc = 2709821 | doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2007.10.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This drug has been in a Phase II trial for early Alzheimers and which has reported preliminarily promising, but not detailed, results.

===Metabolic correction===
This approach is based on the prominent aspect of Alzheimer's disease, which is common for many other neurodegenerative diseases:  energy deficit. It has first been noted for the case of insulin insufficiency in the brain of Alzheimer's patients. Because of that Alzheimer's disease has been called [[Type 3 diabetes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de la Monte SM, Tong M, Lester-Coll N ''et al.'' | year = 2006 | title = Therapeutic rescue of neurodegeneration in experimental type 3 diabetes: relevance to Alzheimer's disease | url = | journal = Journal of Alzheimer's Disease | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 89–109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de la Monte SM, Wands JR | title = Alzheimer's disease is type 3 diabetes-evidence reviewed | journal = Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 1101–13 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19885299 | pmc = 2769828 | doi = 10.1177/193229680800200619 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the insulin modification therapies are in pharmaceutical's pipelines.

=== Other pharmaceuticals ===

Several other pharmaceuticals are under investigation to treat Alzheimer's disease.

====Allopregnanolone====

====Angiotensin receptor blockers====
A retrospective analysis of five million patient records with the US [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] system found that different types of commonly used anti-hypertensive medications had very different AD outcomes.  Those patients taking [[angiotensin receptor blocker]]s (ARBs) were 35—40% less likely to develop AD than those using other anti-hypertensives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news136426165.html "Angiotensin receptor blockers are lower incidence, progression of Alzheimer's disease"]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dimebon====
Also in July 2008 results were announced of a study in which an [[antihistamine]] that was formerly available in Russia, [[Dimebon]], was given to a group of AD patients. The group receiving Dimebon improved somewhat over the 6 months of the study (and this continued for the next six months), whereas those on placebo deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;

In July 2008, researchers announced positive results from [[methylthioninium chloride]] (MTC), (trade name: [[Rember]]) a drug that dissolved Tau polymers.  [[Clinical trial#Phase II|Phase II]] results indicate that it is the first therapy that has success in modifying the course of disease in mild to moderate AD.&lt;ref&gt;

Studies have also shown that people with AD had decreased [[glutamate]] (Glu) as well as decreased Glu/[[creatine]] (Cr), Glu/myo-inositol (mI), Glu/N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and NAA/Cr ratios compared to normal people.

== Bioinformatics approach ==
{{ref section|date=March 2017}}
Although i''n silico'' studies have advanced our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in many different areas, there are still limitations to these methodologies because bioinformatics tools are biased toward known data. Nonetheless, the findings obtained from using publicly available bioinformatics tools and databases have provided a mean to discover new treatments and to spark new questions to facilitate the process of finding cures for AD.

== Pathogenesis and biomarkers ==
From gene expression patterns obtained in microarray datasets, correlation between cellular physiology and diseases can be revealed. Divergence studies (e.g. Jensen-Shannon divergence computations which interprets difference in gene expression and probability of distribution patterns) reveals gene expression distribution difference between AD and normal aging brains.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gómez Ravetti M, Rosso OA, Berretta R, Moscato P | title = Uncovering molecular biomarkers that correlate cognitive decline with the changes of hippocampus' gene expression profiles in Alzheimer's disease | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = e10153 | date = April 2010 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0010153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, expressed genes that are negatively correlated with normal aging brain but are positively correlated with AD brains are possible biomarkers for AD diagnosis and treatment. Combining KEGG and PATHWAY studio, ATP5C1, COX6A1, NDUFV2, PLCB1, and PPP3CA are metabolism and mitochondrial-related genes that have been shown to be reduced in AD samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ongwijitwat S, Wong-Riley MT | title = Functional analysis of the rat cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6A1 promoter in primary neurons | journal = Gene | volume = 337 | pages = 163–71 | date = August 2004 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2004.04.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Washizuka S, Iwamoto K, Kakiuchi C, Bundo M, Kato T | title = Expression of mitochondrial complex I subunit gene NDUFV2 in the lymphoblastoid cells derived from patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia | journal = Neuroscience Research | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 199–204 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19135101 | doi = 10.1016/j.neures.2008.12.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spires TL, Molnár Z, Kind PC, Cordery PM, Upton AL, Blakemore C, Hannan AJ | title = Activity-dependent regulation of synapse and dendritic spine morphology in developing barrel cortex requires phospholipase C-beta1 signalling | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 385–93 | date = April 2005 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhh141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, metabolic dysregulations such as calcium homeostasis &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tiveci S, Akin A, Cakir T, Saybaşili H, Ulgen K | title = Modelling of calcium dynamics in brain energy metabolism and Alzheimer's disease | journal = Computational Biology and Chemistry | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–62 | date = April 2005 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2005.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and insulin signaling have also been identified to contribute to the onset of AD. Genes that are associated with calcium and insulin signaling are found using GATHER (online bioinformatics tool for analyzing genomic signatures).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In fact, insulin signaling impairment and AD has been considered to be related in many levels. Functional protein sequence alignments (e.g. ClustalW, MUSCLE) and phylogenetic analysis (e.g. Phylip, Mega) demonstrate that [[acetylcholinesterase]] (AChE) and [[butyrylcholinesterase]] (BChE) are highly linked in these two diseases. Increased BChE contributes altered lipoprotein metabolism and insulin insensitivity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sánchez-Chávez G, Salceda R | title = Effect of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on activities of cholinesterases in the rat retina | journal = IUBMB Life | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 283–7 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10995030 | doi = 10.1080/15216540050033140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is positively correlated to hypertension and diabetes in correlation studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alcântara VM, Chautard-Freire-Maia EA, Scartezini M, Cerci MS, Braun-Prado K, Picheth G | title = Butyrylcholinesterase activity and risk factors for coronary artery disease | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Clinical and Laboratory Investigation | volume = 62 | issue = 5 | pages = 399–404 | date = 2002-01-01 | pmid = 12387587 | doi = 10.1080/00365510260296564 }}&lt;/ref&gt; AChE allows stabilization of neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh), which is one of the main target for AD treatment. However, recent ''in'' silico pharmacological study examined drug-disease interaction showed that AChE inhibitors may not be the answer to AD treatment. PKC, ARG, HDAC, and GSK3 inhibitors that regulate calcium homeostasis and genetic modification of cell cycle and apoptosis may be the future targets of AD medication.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siavelis JC, Bourdakou MM, Athanasiadis EI, Spyrou GM, Nikita KS | title = Bioinformatics methods in drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease | journal = Briefings in Bioinformatics | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 322–35 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26197808 | doi = 10.1093/bib/bbv048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuronal plasticity is a key player in cognitive function that cannot be ignored in study of AD progression.  Microarray studies found that NEFM, NEFL, and SV2B are highly downregulated in samples obtained from severe AD patients. NEFL is a neurofilament gene that has been shown to be related to hypotrophy of axons in motorneurons when mutated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dubois M, Lalonde R, Julien JP, Strazielle C | title = Mice with the deleted neurofilament of low-molecular-weight (Nefl) gene: 1.

SV2B is another gene that is downregulated in AD and has been shown to be related to neurodegeneration, particularly synaptic calcium-regulated exocytosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heese K, Nagai Y, Sawada T | title = The 3' untranslated region of the new rat synaptic vesicle protein 2B mRNA transcript inhibits translational efficiency | journal = Brain Research. Molecular Brain Research | volume = 104 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–31 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12225865 | doi = 10.1016/s0169-328x(02)00326-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The downregulation of genes responsible for neural synapse and neuroplasticity is related to another family of protein that has been found to be related to AD pathogenesis, EGR (early growth response).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacGibbon GA, Lawlor PA, Walton M, Sirimanne E, Faull RL, Synek B, Mee E, Connor B, Dragunow M | title = Expression of Fos, Jun, and Krox family proteins in Alzheimer's disease | journal = Experimental Neurology | volume = 147 | issue = 2 | pages = 316–32 | date = October 1997 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1006/exnr.1997.6600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This EGR is regulated by upregulated FOXO1 (Forkhead Box O1) through PI3K/Akt pathway,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cabodi S, Morello V, Masi A, Cicchi R, Broggio C, Distefano P, Brunelli E, Silengo L, Pavone F, Arcangeli A, Turco E, Tarone G, Moro L, Defilippi P | title = Convergence of integrins and EGF receptor signaling via PI3K/Akt/FoxO pathway in early gene Egr-1 expression | journal = Journal of Cellular Physiology | volume = 218 | issue = 2 | pages = 294–303 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 18844239 | doi = 10.1002/jcp.21603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is listed as one of the pathway for future in anti-AD medication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These findings using computational methods allow for the connection of different studies and facilitate the understanding of disease complexity as well as directing to new possible biomarkers of AD.

== Pharmacology ==
The current treatment for AD symptoms are [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]]s and [[NMDA antagonist|N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) antagonists]]. Based on the current literature on AD pharmacology research, analyzing differentially expressed genes in drug-drug, disease-disease, and drug-disease models allows the discovery of novel pharmaceutical agents that potentially treat more than AD symptoms. Analytical tools such as Connectivity Map (cMap) were used in drug-disease interaction from publicly available microarray data. Gene signatures from the cMap-based interpretation showed that common anti-AD drugs (tacrine, donepezil, galantamine, memantine, and rivastigmine) were not listed in the final drug list. Rather, other compounds that inhibit downstream effectors of cell proliferation, Wnt and insulin pathways, epigenetic modifications, and cell cycle regulation were among the top in the final anti-AD drug list.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These findings further supported the fact that AD is a disease of degeneration and growth dysregulation. In fact, the final list of anti-AD drugs, obtained from analyzing microarray datasets and cMap drug-disease model contained the common effector of AD and diabetes – glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3-an enzyme that has been found to be related to hyperphosphorylation of tau protein&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forde JE, Dale TC | title = Glycogen synthase kinase 3: a key regulator of cellular fate | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 64 | issue = 15 | pages = 1930–44 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17530463 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-007-7045-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) – confirmed the link between the two diseases. Further pathway and network interpretation of genes obtained from AD microarray datasets using KEGG, WikiPathways, Reactome, Biocarta, and NetworkAnalyst showed that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptors were strongly associated with pathogenesis of AD. EGFR is a transmembrane protein and a member of the HER/ErbB receptor family that share a common pathway with insulin receptors (Ras/Raf/Mak and PI3K/Akt).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jorissen RN, Walker F, Pouliot N, Garrett TP, Ward CW, Burgess AW | title = Epidermal growth factor receptor: mechanisms of activation and signalling | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 284 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–53 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12648464 | doi = 10.1016/s0014-4827(02)00098-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, amyloid protein precursor (APP) was found to be indirectly related based on network analysis. Aβ (one of the diagnostic findings of AD) activates EGFR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siddiqui S, Fang M, Ni B, Lu D, Martin B, Maudsley S | title = Central role of the EGF receptor in neurometabolic aging | journal = International Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 2012 | pages = 739428 | date = 2012-01-01 | pmid = 22754566 | pmc = 3382947 | doi = 10.1155/2012/739428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and inhibition of the receptor improved memory disorders in Aβ-overexpressed drosophila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang L, Chiang HC, Wu W, Liang B, Xie Z, Yao X, Ma W, Du S, Zhong Y | title = Epidermal growth factor receptor is a preferred target for treating amyloid-β-induced memory loss | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 41 | pages = 16743–8 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23019586 | pmc = 3478595 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1208011109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs that block GSK3 were found to be affecting PI3K/Akt pathway, demonstrating that EGFR could be a new target for pharmaceutical agent in treating AD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1766">'''Andy and Bill's law''' is a statement regarding the relationship between hardware and software upgrades. The law originates from a humorous one-liner told in the 1990s during computing conferences: "what Andy giveth, Bill taketh away." The phrase is a riff upon the business strategies of former [[Intel]] CEO [[Andy Grove]], and former CEO of [[Microsoft]], [[Bill Gates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2005/04/19/cz_rk_0419karlgaard.html#8594233740d6|title=Ten Laws Of The Modern World|last=Karlgaard|first=Rich|date=April 19, 2005|website=Forbes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intel and Microsoft had entered into a lucrative partnership in the 1980s through to the 1990s, and the standard [[chipset|chipsets]] in Microsoft [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] were Intel brand. Despite the profit Intel gained from the deal, Grove felt that Gates wasn't making full use of the powerful capabilities of Intel chips, and that he was in fact refusing to upgrade his software to achieve optimum hardware performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/07/10/204258/index.htm|title=Why Andy Grove Can't Stop|last=Schlender|first=Brent|date=July 10, 1995|website=FORTUNE Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grove's frustration with the dominance of Microsoft software over Intel hardware became public, which spawned the humorous catchphrase; and, later, Andy and Bill's law: that new software will always push ahead of hardware and get credit for the performance of the computer.

== History ==
AVG was incorporated in [[Kuala Lumpur]] by German [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]] Tim Marbach in 2013. That year, AVG invested USD500,000 in [[imoney.my]], a Malaysia-based financial products comparison site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imoney-group.com/malaysias-imoney-raises-seed-funding-preps-personal-finance-platform-launch-in-singapore/|title=Malaysia’s iMoney Raises Seed Funding, Preps Personal Finance Platform Launch in Singapore {{!}} Intelligent Money Sdn. Bhd.|date=2013-06-04|website=Intelligent Money Sdn. Bhd.|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, AVG co-founded its second company, [[TrustedCompany]], a review platform for [[e-commerce]] businesses in [[Malaysia]], [[India]] and [[Brazil]].

In 2014, Kai Kux joined AVG as its Managing Director. AVG co-founded its third and fourth companies in 2014.

A '''spacer''' is a device used to increase the ease of administering aerosolized medication from a [[metered-dose inhaler]] (MDI). It adds space in the form of a tube or “chamber” between the mouth and canister of medication. Most spacers have a one-way valve that allows the person to inhale the medication while inhaling and exhaling normally; these are often referred to as '''valved holding chambers''' (VHC).

Spacers help those unable to breathe deeply, as well as those unable to synchronize their breathing so that they inhale just as the MDI is actuated; the latter is known as poor "hand-lung coordination".&lt;ref name=Nikanderp5&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nikander |first=Kurt|last2=Nicholls|first2=Clare|last3=Denyer|first3=John|last4=Pritchard|first4=John|year=2014|title=The Evolution of Spacers and Valved Holding Chambers |work=Journal of Aerosol Medicine and Pulmonary Drug Delivery|volume=27|issue=1|pages=(S4–S23), S5 |url=https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/jamp.2013.1076 |pmid=25054481|doi=10.1089/jamp.2013.1076|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
__TOC__
==Terminology==
The term spacer is often used to refer to any tube-like MDI add-on device. Some spacers utilize a collapsing bag design to provide visual feedback that successful inspiration is taking place. Another type is transparent plastic in two vase-shaped parts that come together forming a barrel shape.

==Application and benefits==
[[File:Asthma Inhaler (29172634251).jpg|thumb|[[Metered-dose inhaler]] (MDI); the mouthpiece slots into the back of the spacer.]]
To use an inhaler without a spacer requires coordinating several actions in a set order (pressing down on the inhaler, breathing in deeply as soon as the medication is released, holding your breath, exhaling), and not everyone is able to master this sequence. Use of a spacer, particularly a valved holding chamber, avoids such timing issues. Valved holding chambers are particularly useful for children, people with severe shortness of breath, and those with cognitive impairment.{{sfn|Nikander|Nicholls|Denyer|Pritchard|2014|p=S13}}

After removing the MDI's cap, the MDI mouthpiece is inserted into the back of the spacer. The front part of the chamber is closed off by either a mouthpiece or a mask that covers the mouth and nose. To administer the medication, the MDI is depressed once, resulting in the release of one dose of medication. The medication from the MDI is then suspended in the spacer's chamber while the person inhales the aerosolized medication by breathing in and out. The exhaled breath exits the device through the [[valve]]s rather than entering the chamber. Some spacers are equipped with a whistle, which sounds if the person is inhaling too quickly.

Spacers slow down the speed of the [[Particulate|aerosol]] coming from the inhaler, meaning that less of the [[asthma medication|asthma drug]] impacts on the back of the mouth and somewhat more may get into the lungs.&lt;ref name=Nikanderp5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy''. 18th ed, Wiley, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;405.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[corticosteroid]]s, less residue in the mouth reduces the risk of developing [[oral candidiasis]], a yeast infection. Rinsing the mouth after application of inhaled steroids has a similar effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asthma.partners.org/newfiles/inhaledsteroids.html |title=Asthma and Inhaled Steroids |website=Asthma.partners.org|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas people with asthma can keep an MDI close-by at all times, the bulkiness of spacers can limit their use outside the home.

'''Automatic fire suppression''' systems control and extinguish [[fire]]s without human intervention. Examples of automatic systems include [[fire sprinkler system]], [[gaseous fire suppression]], and [[condensed aerosol fire suppression]]. When fires are extinguished in the early stages loss of life is minimal since 93% of all fire-related deaths occur once the fire has progressed beyond the early stages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://femalifesafety.org/fire-facts.html Fire Equipment Manufacturers Association: Fire Facts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217070535/http://femalifesafety.org/fire-facts.html |date=February 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfpa.org/news-and-research/fire-statistics-and-reports/fire-statistics/fire-safety-equipment/non-water-based-automatic-fire-extinguishing-equipment NFPA: Non-water based automatic fire extinguishing equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of automatic systems ==
Today there are numerous types of Automatic Fire Suppression Systems and standards for each one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/document-information-pages NFPA Codes and Standards]&lt;/ref&gt; Systems are as diverse as the many applications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.cy/books?id=a8jU-2xyw5EC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=principles+of+fire+protection+and+types&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RLoef2hteB&amp;sig=8TJNOt3AqPow27OcOI_o5_Ure7Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjeg7XOrq7LAhWD03IKHdYuCrQQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=principles%20of%20fire%20protection%20and%20types&amp;f=false Principles of Fire Protection: Arthur E. Cote, Percy Bugbee]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.iccsafe.org/states/newyorkcity/Building/PDFs/Chapter%209_Fire%20Protection%20Systems.pdf New York Building City Code: Fire Protection Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, however, Automatic Fire Suppression Systems fall into two categories: ''engineered'' and ''pre-engineered'' systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.cy/books?id=xP2zCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1623&amp;lpg=PA1623&amp;dq=engineered+vs+pre-engineered+systems&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1_0kz0IFYr&amp;sig=oOaw7ID2m22XIBlgZJ_j2Qkj8Z4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKucGKs67LAhUlvHIKHTomDyoQ6AEIRDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=engineered%20vs%20pre-engineered%20systems&amp;f=false SFPE Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Engineered Fire Suppression Systems''' are design specific and most commonly used for larger installations where the system is designed for a particular application. Examples include large marine and land vehicle applications, server rooms, public and private buildings, industrial paint lines, dip tanks and electrical switch rooms. Engineered systems use a number of gaseous or solid agents with many of them being specifically formulated. Some are even stored as a [[liquid]] and discharged as a [[gas]].
* '''Pre-Engineered Fire Suppression Systems''' use pre-designed elements to eliminate the need for engineering work beyond the original product design. Typical industrial solutions use a wet or dry chemical agent, such as [[potassium carbonate]] or [[monoammonium phosphate]] (MAP), to protect relatively smaller spaces such as distribution boards, battery rooms, engine bays, wind turbines, hazardous goods and other storage areas. A number of residential designs have also emerged that typically employ water mist and target retrofit applications.

==Components==
By definition, an automatic fire suppression system can operate without human intervention.  To do so it must possess a means of detection, actuation and delivery. In many systems, detection is accomplished by mechanical or electrical means.  Mechanical detection uses fusible-link or thermo-bulb detectors.  These detectors are designed to separate at a specific temperature and release tension on a release mechanism.  Electrical detection uses heat detectors equipped with self-restoring, normally-open contacts which close when a predetermined temperature is reached. Remote and local manual operation is also possible. Actuation usually involves either a pressurized fluid and a release valve, or in some cases an electric pump. Delivery is accomplished by means of piping and nozzles. Nozzle design is specific to the agent used and coverage desired.

==Extinguishing agents==
In the early days, water was the exclusive fire suppression agent.  Although still used today, water has limitations.  Most notably, its liquid and conductive properties can cause as much property damage as fire itself.

==Health and Environmental Concerns==
Despite their effectiveness, chemical fire extinguishing agents are not without disadvantages. In the early 20th century, [[carbon tetrachloride]] was extensively used as a dry cleaning solvent, a refrigerant and as a fire extinguishing agent. In time, it was found carbon tetrachloride could lead to severe health effects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ctu-sc/files/doc/ctu-sc/ctu-n75_eng.pdf Advances in Fire Suppression Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-1960s [[Halon 1301]] was the industry standard for protecting high-value assets from the threat of fire.  Halon 1301 had many benefits as a fire suppression agent; it is fast-acting, safe for assets and required minimal storage space.  Halon 1301's major drawbacks are that it depletes atmospheric [[ozone]] and is potentially harmful to humans. Since 1987, some 191 nations have signed The [[Montreal Protocol]] on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer. The Protocol is an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of a number of substances believed to be responsible for ozone depletion.  Among these were [[halogenated hydrocarbons]] often used in fire suppression. As a result, manufacturers have focused on alternatives to Halon 1301 and Halon 1211 (halogenated hydrocarbons). A number of countries have also taken steps to mandate the removal of installed Halon systems.  Most notably these include Germany and Australia, the first two countries in the world to require this action.  In both of these countries complete removal of installed Halon systems has been completed except for a very few essential-use applications. The [[European Union]] is currently undergoing a similar mandated removal of installed Halon systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.cy/books?id=4owesIEs8nIC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=eu+mandated+removal+of+installed+Halon+systems&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xWvQZzyDuh&amp;sig=lmT8rW1VuNCGaqEmoDaMbi3X_8Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja7LzrsK7LAhUGwHIKHQ1tD_AQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=eu%20mandated%20removal%20of%20installed%20Halon%20systems&amp;f=false 2002 Report of the Halons Technical Options Committee: 2002 Assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/el/fire_research/upload/R0002162.pdf European Union legislation on ozone-depleting substances is expected to become law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://easa.europa.eu/system/files/dfu/NPA%202014-26.pdf Update of Part-26 to comply with ICAO Standards]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/2011_q4/3/ Robin Bennett, Hazardous Materials Leader, Product Development, Environmental Performance Strategy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History== 
The first [[fire extinguisher]] patent was issued to Alanson Crane of Virginia on Feb. 10, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US37610 Improved Apparatus for Extinguishing Fires in Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[fire sprinkler system]] was patented by H.W. Pratt in 1872. But the first practical automatic sprinkler system was invented in 1874 by [[Henry S. Parmalee]] of New Haven, CT.  He installed the system in a piano factory he owned.

==Modern systems==
Since the early 1990s manufacturers have successfully developed safe and effective Halon alternatives. These include [[DuPont]]'s FM-200, American Pacific’s Halotron, [[FirePro Systems (Europe)|FirePro]]'s FPC Compound and [[3M]]'s Novec 1230 Fire Protection Fluid.  Generally, the Halon replacement agents available today fall into two broad categories, in-kind (gaseous extinguishing agents) or not in-kind (alternative technologies). In-kind gaseous agents generally fall into two further categories, halocarbons and inert gases.  Not in-kind alternatives include such options as water mist or the use of early warning smoke detection systems.

'''Band-gap engineering''' is the process of controlling or altering the [[band gap]] of a material. This is typically done to [[semiconductors]] by controlling the composition of alloys or constructing layered materials with alternating compositions. A band gap is the range in a solid where no electron state can exist. The band gap of [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] is much larger than in semiconductors. Conductors or metals have a much smaller or nonexistent band gap than semiconductors since the [[Valence (chemistry)|valence]] and conduction bands overlap. Controlling the band gap allows for the creation of desirable electrical properties.

== Molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) ==
[[Molecular-beam epitaxy]] is a technique used to construct thin epitaxial films of materials ranging from oxides to semiconductors to metals. Different beams of atoms and molecules in an ultra-high vacuum environment are shot onto a nearly atomically clean crystal, creating a layering effect. This is a type of [[thin-film deposition]]. Semiconductors are the most commonly used material due to their use in electronics. Technologies such as quantum well devices, super-lattices, and lasers are possible with MBE. Epitaxial films are useful due to their ability to be produced with electrical properties different from those of the substrate, either higher purity, or fewer defects or with a different concentration of electrically active impurities as desired.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, John R. "Molecular Beam Epitaxy." ''Surface Science'' 500, no. 1-3 (2002): 189–217.&lt;/ref&gt; Varying the composition of the material alters the band gap due to bonding of different atoms with differing energy level gaps.

== Strain-induced band-gap engineering ==
Semiconducting materials are able to be altered with strain-inducing from tunable sizes and shapes due to [[quantum confinement]] effects. A larger tunable bandgap range is possible due to the high elastic limit of semiconducting nanostructures.&lt;ref&gt;Shao, Rui-Wen, Kun Zheng, Bin Wei, Yue-Fei Zhang, Yu-Jie Li, Xiao-Dong Han, Ze Zhang, and Jin Zou. "Bandgap Engineering and Manipulating Electronic and Optical Properties of ZnO Nanowires by Uniaxial Strain." ''Nanoscale'', no. 9 (2014): 4936–941. Accessed November 17, 2014. http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2014/nr/c4nr00059e.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strain is the ratio of extension to original length, and can be used on the nanoscale.&lt;ref&gt;"Stress &amp; Strain." PhysicsNetcouk RSS. Accessed December 4, 2014. http://physicsnet.co.uk/a-level-physics-as-a2/materials/stress-strain/.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ZnO nanowires ===
ZnO [[Nanowires]] are used in nanogenerators, nanowire field effect [[transistors]], piezo-electric diodes, and chemical sensors. Several studies have been conducted on the effect of strain on different physical properties. Sb-doped ZnO nanowires experience variation in resistance when exposed to strain. Bending strain can induce an increase in electrical conductance. Strain can also induce change of transport properties and band-gap variation. By correlating these two effects under experimentation the variation of transport properties as a function of band-gap can be generated. Electrical measurements are obtained using scanning tunnelling microscope-transmission [[electron microscope]] probing system.&lt;ref&gt;Shao, Rui-Wen, Kun Zheng, Bin Wei, Yue-Fei Zhang, Yu-Jie Li, Xiao-Dong Han, Ze Zhang, and Jin Zou. "Bandgap Engineering and Manipulating Electronic and Optical Properties of ZnO Nanowires by Uniaxial Strain." ''Nanoscale'', no. 9 (2014): 4936–941. Accessed November 17, 2014. http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2014/nr/c4nr00059e.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy band-gap engineering of graphene nanoribbons ==
When [[lithography|lithographically]] generated graphene ribbons are laterally confined in charge it creates an energy gap near the charge neutrality point. The narrower the ribbons result in larger energy gap openings based on temperature dependent [[Electrical conductance|conductance]]. A narrow ribbon is considered a quasi one dimensional system in which an energy band gap opening is expected. Single sheets of [[graphene]] are mechanically extracted from bulk graphite crystals onto a silicon substrate and are contacted with Cr/Au metal electrodes. Hydrogen silsesquioxane is spun onto the samples to form an etch mask and then oxygen plasma is used to etch away the unprotected graphene.&lt;ref&gt;Han, Melinda, Barbaros Özyilmaz, Yuanbo Zhang, and Philip Kim. "Energy Band-Gap Engineering of Graphene Nanoribbons." ''Physical Review Letters'', 2007, 1. Accessed December 4, 2014. https://arxiv.org/ftp/cond-mat/papers/0702/0702511.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

Barkhausen's criterion applies to [[linear circuits]] with a [[feedback loop]]. It cannot be applied directly to active elements with [[negative resistance]] like [[tunnel diode]] oscillators.

The kernel of the criterion is that a [[Zeros_and_poles|complex pole pair]] must be placed on the [[imaginary axis]] of the [[Complex_plane|complex frequency plane]] if [[steady state]] oscillations should take place. In the real world, it is impossible to balance on the imaginary axis, so in practice a steady-state oscillator is a non-linear circuit:

* It needs to have [[Feedback#Positive_feedback|positive feedback]].
* The [[loop gain]] is at unity (&lt;math&gt;|\beta A| = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;).

==Criterion==
It states that if ''A'' is the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of the amplifying element in the circuit and β(''j''ω) is the [[transfer function]] of the feedback path, so β''A'' is the [[loop gain]] around the [[feedback loop]] of the circuit, the circuit will sustain steady-state oscillations only at frequencies for which:
#The loop gain is equal to unity in absolute magnitude, that is, &lt;math&gt;|\beta A| = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;  and
#The [[phase shift]] around the loop is zero or an integer multiple of 2π: &lt;math&gt;\angle \beta A = 2 \pi n, n \in \{0, 1, 2,\dots\}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Barkhausen's criterion is a ''necessary'' condition for oscillation but not a ''sufficient'' condition: some circuits satisfy the criterion but do not oscillate.&lt;ref name="Lindberg"&gt;{{cite conference

==Erroneous version==
Barkhausen's original "formula for self-excitation", intended for determining the oscillation frequencies of the feedback loop, involved an equality sign: |β''A''| = 1. At the time conditionally-stable nonlinear systems were poorly understood; it was widely believed that this gave the boundary between stability (|β''A''| &lt; 1) and instability (|β''A''| ≥ 1), and this erroneous version found its way into the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Although designed to be a [[chair]], due to its amorphous nature it is often confused with [[Tuffet|tuffets]] and [[Ottoman (furniture)|ottomans]].

== History ==
'''Sacco''',&lt;ref name="Vitra Design Museum"/&gt; the first artifact of that kind, was introduced in 1968 by three Italian designers: Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro.&lt;ref name="Vitra Design Museum"/&gt; The object was created in the Italian Modernism movement.&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"&gt;{{cite book |last=Raizman |first=David |editor-last=May |editor-first=Susie |title=History of Modern Design Second Edition |publisher=Laurence King Publishing |date=2010 |pages=256–306 |chapter=Part V: Humanism and Luxury: International Modernism and Mass Culture after Word War II (1945-1960) |isbn=978-1-85669-694-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Being a post war era phenomenon, Italian modernism’s design was highly inspired with new available technology. Post war technology allowed an increase in the processes of production, by introducing new materials such as polystyrene. The idea of mass-produced goods made within an inexpensive price range appealed to consumers. It therefore created the need for a revolution in the creative and manufacturing process. ‘The designer was an integral member of a process that included marketing as well as engineering’ (Raizman 284).&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"/&gt; The inspiration left by Corradino D’Ascano’s [[Vespa]] design for the [[Piaggio]] Corporation in 1946, added value to the essence of the designer. With successful designs, brands could sell more products, and therefore the identity of the designer played an important advertising role.&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"/&gt;
Another important figure of the Italian modernism period was [[Gio Ponti]]. Inspired by modernism's art movements, Ponti created new forms of objects. His asymmetrically balanced designs freed the Italian objects form their classic representations. The designer promoted Italian designs on famous exhibitions called ‘Milan [[Triennale]]’ :  “These exhibitions, organized as early as the 1920s … were responsible for increasing the visibility of Italian design in an international setting ” (Raizman 285).&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"/&gt; After becoming an editor of the [[Domus (magazine)]] in 1947, Ponti contributed to not only Italian design of that time, but also : “the human and creative element in modern industrial design as well as its practical, economic and social benefits.”(Raizman 285)&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"/&gt;

Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro, inspired by their designer predecessors, came up in 1968 with the design of Sacco the ‘shapeless chair’. Although it was not the first design of an amorphous chair in Italian history, Sacco was the first successful product created in partnership with [[Zanotta (company)|Zanotta]]. The predecessor of the product had a major design flaw of not being able to sustain its form and therefore never reached production. Sacco picked up that flaw and with the use of leather for exterior and right placed stitching. It is worth mentioning that the use of leather was not coincidental as at that time the textile was an Italian national pride product.&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"/&gt; The target user of the chair was the lax, hippie community and their non-conformist household. "In an era characterized by the hippie culture, apartment sharing and student demonstrations, the thirty-something designers created a nonpoltrona (non-chair) and thus launched an attack on good bourgeois taste."&lt;ref name="Vitra Design Museum"/&gt;

==Other bean bag chair products inspired by Sacco==
Other designers have followed the ‘shapeless’ chair design, creating a range of inspired products that take after Sacco.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/02/beanbag-chair-make-your-own# | title=How to bag a beanbag chair | publisher=The Guardian | date=2 June 2009 | accessdate=10 January 2014 | author=Griffiths, Sally}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst many, the most successful contemporary model would be [[Jukka Setala]]’s Fatboy. The product launched in 2002 brought the Finnish designer global recognition. The new form of the bean bag chair has less stitching and a more geometrical take in the means of shape. It also has (just like ALL bean bags) an [[Expanded polystyrene|EPS]] filling which is more durable than [[PVC]] that hardly anyone use.&lt;ref name="Fatboy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatboy.com/nl/bean-bags/original# |title=Fatboy original |publisher=Fatboy |date=2002 |accessdate=16 October 2014 |author=Fatboy }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''ceiling balloon''' also called a '''pilot balloon''' or '''pibal''', is used by [[meteorologists]] to determine the height of the base of [[clouds]] [[above ground level]] during daylight hours. In the past, and sometimes today, a [[theodolite]] was used to track the balloon in order to determine the speed and direction of winds aloft.&lt;ref name="Brenner"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csulb.edu/~mbrenner/balloon.htm |title=Pilot Weather Balloon (Pibal) Optical Theodolites |last=Brenner |first=Martin |work=Martin Brenner's Pilot Balloon Resources |publisher=California State University, Long Beach |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2014-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The principle behind the ceiling balloon is that timing of a balloon with a known ascent rate (how fast it climbs) from its release until it disappears into the clouds can be used to calculate the height of the bottom of the clouds.

==How it is used==
A ceiling [[balloon]] is a small, usually red, (fluted) [[rubber]] balloon commonly measuring 76 mm (3 in) across prior to inflation, inflated to ~40 cm (~15.75 in) diameter. After inflation the balloon is taken outside and released. By timing the balloon from release until it enters the cloud a ceiling height can be obtained. When correctly inflated the balloon will rise at rate of 140 m/min (460 ft/min). The bases of clouds are very rarely flat and solid, so the ceiling height is not when the balloon disappears but when the colour begins to fade. The balloon can also be used to measure the vertical visibility into a layer of [[fog]] or [[blizzard|blowing snow]]. In this case the balloon will begin to fade as soon as it is released, so the vertical visibility is when the balloon disappears. If the balloon is visible for a considerable distance into the cloud layer the observer should make note of it as it is of importance to aircraft.

The ceiling balloon is a reliable, safe and simple way to get an indication of the height of clouds. However, it does suffer from some disadvantages that the observer must be aware of. [[Rain]] and wet [[snow]] may slow the ascent of the balloon, giving a falsely high ceiling and high winds and poor visibility may cause the balloon to appear to enter the cloud before it actually does. As the balloon rises at a rate of 140 m/min (460 ft/min) it will take over five minutes for the balloon to reach 700 m (2300 ft). Beyond this height the ability to follow the balloon, even with binoculars, is poor, as even the slightest movement of the eye off the balloon will almost certainly ensure that it vanishes.

At night when it is not practical to use a balloon the [[ceiling projector]] is used. However, during twilight it may be impossible to use the ceiling projector and then a pibal (pilot balloon) light may be used. This is a simple flashlight bulb attached to a battery. To charge the battery it is immersed in water for three minutes and then tied to the balloon prior to inflation. These are rarely used today.

==Technical details==
The balloons and associated equipment are usually stored in a cabinet mounted on a wall close to the gas cylinders. The cabinet has three doors one of which opens down and to it the filler stand is attached. At the top of the filler stand is a "L" shaped pipe with two rings, a small one on the bottom and a larger one on the top called the [[inflation]] nozzle. The rings stop the tube from dropping through the stand or rising too far when the balloon is inflated. The top ring has several grooves cut into it, to help grip the balloon which is fitted to it.

At the bottom of the pipe is a weight that, when the precise amount of gas has been added, will lift to indicate the balloon is full. A rubber hose is attached to this pipe and passes through the filler stand twice. The first hole is larger than the tube to permit movement, while the second is used to hold the tubing in place.

From there the tube runs to a [[needle valve]] that controls the amount of gas flowing to the balloon. A second tube will then run from the valve to a [[pressure regulator|regulator valve]] that is attached to the gas cylinder. This valve has two pressure gauges attached. One showing the total pressure remaining in the gas cylinder and the second showing the amount of gas flowing through the tubing. Typically the cylinder, which is made of steel and weighs about 140 lb (65 kg). It contains the equivalent of about 200 ft³ (5.7 m³) of gas at standard pressure, stored at a pressure of 2000 psi (14 [[megapascal]]s) and will inflate approximately 120 balloons (according to a nominal diameter of 45 cm).

On the opposite side of the cabinet is space to store balloons, string and pibal lights. The gas used to fill the balloon is  [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]]. Because of its low cost ceiling balloons are often filled with hydrogen gas, but sometimes helium is used.

The balloon is attached to the inflation nozzle and a piece of string is wound around the neck. After donning safety glasses and hearing protection a check is made to ensure the needle valve is fully closed. The main valve on the cylinder is then opened, followed by the regulator valve. Next, the needle valve is opened and the balloon begins to inflate. As the balloon reaches the correct size the inflation nozzle will begin to lift. At this point the needle valve is closed along with the regulator valve and cylinder vale. The string is then used to tie off the balloon neck to ensure that no gas can escape.

Caution must be used during inflation due to the occasional faulty balloon and its failure. If the person inflating the balloon is not wearing goggles or hearing protectors then eye or ear damage can result.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33406">:''This article is about the claims. For the aircraft and flights themselves, see [[Early flying machines]]''

Several aviators have been claimed as the first to fly a powered aeroplane. 

Much controversy has surrounded these claims. It is most widely held today that the [[Wright Brothers]] were the first to fly successfully. Brazil regards [[Santos-Dumont]] as the first successful aviator because the [[Wright Flyer]] took off from a rail and, after 1903, used a catapult. An editorial in the influential ''Jane's All the World's Aircraft'' 2013 edition supported the claim of [[Gustave Whitehead]].

==Significant claims==
Several aviators and/or their supporters have laid claim to the first manned flight in a powered aeroplane.  Claims that have received significant attention include:
* [[Clément Ader]] in the [[Avion III]] (1897)
* [[Gustave Whitehead]] in his No's. 21 and 22 aeroplanes (1901–1903)
* [[Richard Pearse]] in his monoplane (1903–1904)
* [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]]'s [[Langley Aerodrome|Aerodrome A]] (1903)
* [[Karl Jatho]] in Jatho biplane (1903)
* The [[Wright brothers]] in the [[Wright Flyer]] (1903)
* [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]] in the [[14 Bis]] (1906)

In judging these claims, the generally accepted requirements are for sustained powered and controlled flight. In 1890 Ader had made a brief uncontrolled and unsustained "hop" in his [[Ader Éole|Éole]], but such a hop is not regarded as true flight. The ability to take off unaided is also sometimes regarded as necessary. The air historian [[Charles Gibbs-Smith]] has said that, "The criteria of powered flight must remain to some extent a matter of opinion."&lt;ref name="gs-haf"&gt;Gibbs-Smith (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Antecedents===
[[File:1874DuTemple.jpg|thumb|The [[du Temple monoplane]]]]
Some notable powered hops were made before the problem of powered flight was finally solved.

In 1874 [[Félix du Temple]] built a steam-powered aeroplane which took off from a ramp with a sailor on board and remained airborne for a short distance. This has sometimes been claimed as the first powered flight in history but the claim is generally rejected because takeoff was gravity-assisted and flight was not sustained. It is however credited as the first powered take-off in history.&lt;ref name="wragg"&gt;Wragg (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelucci &amp; Marticardi (1977), Pages 16, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years later in 1884 the Russian [[Alexander Mozhaysky]] achieved similar success, launching his craft from a ramp and remaining airborne for 30&amp;nbsp;m (98&amp;nbsp;ft). The claim that this was a sustained flight has not been taken seriously outside Russia.&lt;ref name="wragg" /&gt;

[[Clément Ader]]'s [[Ader Éole|Éole]] of 1890 was a bat-winged tractor monoplane which achieved a brief, uncontrolled hop, becoming the first heavier-than-air machine in history to take off from level ground under its own power.&lt;ref name="wragg" /&gt; However his hop is not regarded as true flight because it was neither sustained nor controlled. Ader would later make a false claim of a more extended flight.&lt;ref name="wragg" /&gt;

In 1896, [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]], the Secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], had successful flights with several unpiloted models, and his ''Number 6'' model flew more than {{convert|5000|ft|m}}. From these successes, in 1898 Langley received grants from the War Department for $50,000 and an additional $20,000 from the Smithsonian, to attempt development of a piloted version.

The 1901 [[Kress Drachenflieger|Drachenflieger]] of [[Wilhelm Kress]] did not even achieve a hop. A [[floatplane]], it is notable as the first heavier-than-air craft to be powered by an [[internal combustion engine]] rather than steam.{{citation needed|date=October 2014|reason=sources given in associated article not checked}} It demonstrated good control when taxiing, but was too underpowered to take off.&lt;ref name="wragg" /&gt;

===The period of claimed flights===
[[File:Northeast Texas Rural Heritage Museum August 2015 32 (Ezekiel Airship).jpg|thumb|A replica of the [[Ezekiel Airship]], which is claimed to have flown in [[Pittsburg, Texas]] in 1902, although there is no physical evidence to support such a claim.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Local inventor beat Wright brothers, Texas townsfolk say|url = http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/Southwest/12/17/ezekiel.aircraft/index.html|website = [[CNN.com]]|accessdate = August 2, 2015|date = December 17, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Few of the claims to powered flight were widely accepted, or even made, at the time the events took place. Both the Wrights and Whitehead suffered in their early years from a lack of general recognition, while neither Ader nor Langley made any claim in the years immediately following their work.

The pioneer [[Octave Chanute]] promoted the Wrights' work, some of which he witnessed, in America and Europe. The brothers began to gain recognition in Britain, where Colonel [[John Edward Capper]] was taking charge of Army aeronautical work. On a visit to the U.S. in 1904 Capper befriended the Wrights and subsequently helped foster their early recognition. He also visited Langley, who openly discussed his failure with Capper.&lt;ref name="walkerII"&gt;Walker (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The perspective changed in 1906. Early in the year Langley died, without ever making any claim. The U.S. Army rejected a proposal from the Wrights on the basis that their machine's ability to fly had not been demonstrated. Thus, when Alberto Santos-Dumont made a brief flight that year in his 14-Bis aeroplane, there was no acknowledged antecedent and he was acclaimed in France and elsewhere as the first to fly. Ader responded by claiming that he had flown in his Avion III back in 1897.&lt;ref name="wragg" /&gt;

===Claims and recognition===
Santos-Dumont's 1906 claim to flight has never been seriously disputed, although few authorities credit his as the first, while some have questioned the effectiveness of his controls.&lt;ref name="wbo" /&gt;

In 1908 the Wrights embarked on a series of demonstrations with their by now much improved Flyers, Orville in America and Wilbur in Europe. The European demonstrations drew instant recognition of their technical achievements, although both the use of a launch trolley and lack of aerodynamic stability meant that acceptance of the first flight claim was not universal.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Ader's claim was debunked in 1910, when the official report on his work was finally published.&lt;ref name="wragg" /&gt;

In America the Smithsonian Institution began to promulgate a claim for Langley, who had been its Secretary from 1887 until his death. In 1914 they loaned the Aerodrome to [[Glenn Curtiss]] who modified it heavily until it became capable of brief flights. They used this as the basis for a claim that the Aerodrome was the first aeroplane "capable of flight". Orville, the surviving Wright brother, began a long and bitter legal battle to force it to recognize their claim to primacy, his disgust reaching such a peak that in 1928 he sent the historic Flyer for display in the British [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] in [[London]]. He eventually succeeded in his battle when the Smithsonian admitted to Curtiss' modifications and withdrew its claim in 1942.&lt;ref name="crouch2003"&gt;Crouch, T.; ''The Bishop's Boys: A Life of Wilbur and Orville Wright,'' Norton 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="honious" /&gt;

Meanwhile, with the publication of a co-authored article and a book by the journalist [[Stella Randolph]], Whitehead had also begun to gain vocal advocates. In 1945 Orville Wright issued a critique of the evidence for Whitehead.&lt;ref name="weissenb" /&gt;

Orville died on January 30, 1948. As part of the Smithsonian's final deal with his executors, the Flyer was returned to its native America and put on display. A clause in the contract required the Smithsonian to claim primacy for the Wrights, on pain of losing the prize exhibit.&lt;ref name="crouch2013" /&gt;

Whitehead's advocates have fought an equally bitter battle with the Smithsonian in an attempt to gain recognition, in which the Smithsonian's contract with the Wright estate has been subject to heavy criticism. Although Whitehead's advocates have gained some following, they remain in the minority.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

It is most widely held today that the Wright Brothers were the first to make controlled sustained heavier-than-air flights. Brazil still officially regards Santos-Dumont as the first successful aviator because his craft did not use an external launch system. {{citation needed|date=October 2014|reason=Brazil does? - and Brazil only?}}

==Ader==
[[File:AderAvion3(1897).jpg|thumb|The ''Avion III'']]
Following his hop in the Éole, [[Clément Ader]] obtained funding from the French Ministry for War. He completed the similar but larger [[Ader Avion III|Avion III]] in 1897. In trials it failed to leave the ground at all, and remains notable only for its twin steam engines.&lt;ref name="wragg" /&gt;

Several years later in 1906, following Blériot's first successful flights Ader claimed publicly that his ''Éole'' had flown for 330&amp;nbsp;ft (100 m) in 1891, and that the ''Avion III'' had flown for 1,000&amp;nbsp;ft on the second day of its trials.&lt;ref name="wragg" /&gt;

Ader's claim for the ''Avion III'' was refuted four years later in 1910, when the French Ministry for War finally published its report on his work.&lt;ref name="wragg" /&gt; His claim for the ''Éole'' also collapsed through lack of credibility.&lt;ref name="wragg" /&gt;

==Whitehead==
[[File:Whitehead woodcut.jpg|thumb|The illustration that accompanied the claim in the ''Bridgeport Herald'']]
When Gustav Weisskopf immigrated to the United States he changed his name to [[Gustave Whitehead]]. There he began an extensive series of experiments with gliders, aero engines and motorized flying machines. Whitehead and other sources have claimed he made successful powered airplane flights.

*Louis Darvarich, a friend of Whitehead, said they flew together in a steam-powered machine in 1899 and crashed into the side of a building in their path.&lt;ref name="weissenb"&gt;Weissenborn, G.K.; "Did Whitehead fly?", ''Air Enthusiast'' '''35''', Pilot Press (1988), Pages 19-21 and 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''Bridgeport Herald'' newspaper reported that on August 14, 1901 Whitehead flew his "No.21" monoplane to a height of {{convert|50|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and could steer it a little by shifting his weight to the left or right.&lt;ref name="weissenb"/&gt;
*Whitehead wrote letters to a magazine, saying that in 1902 he made two flights in his No.22 machine, including a circle, steering with a combination of the rudder and variable speeds of the two propellers.&lt;ref name="weissenb" /&gt;

===Controversy ignites===

Stanley Beach was a friend of Whitehead, sharing a patent application with him in 1905. Beach's father was editor of [[Scientific American]], which was initially sympathetic to Whitehead and included a number of reports of short flights by Whitehead.&lt;ref&gt;''Sci. American'', September 19, 1903, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sci. American'', January 27, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Santos Dumont's Latest Flight", ''Sci Am'', November 24, 1906, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Second Annual Exhibition of the Aero Club of America", ''Sci. Am'', December 15, 1906, p. 448-449&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sci. American'', January 25, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Beach and Whitehead fell out and, now editor of the Scientific American in his turn, Beach denied that Whitehead ever flew.&lt;ref name=Malan2005&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.flyingmachines.org/DougMalanGWArticle.html |work=Connecticut Life |date=September 13, 2005 |title=The Man Who Would Be King: Gustave Whitehead and the battle with the Smithsonian |last=Malan |first=Douglas |publisher=Flying Machines |accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead's claims were not taken seriously until two journalists, Stella Randolph and Harvey Phillips, wrote an article in a 1935 edition of ''Popular Aviation'' journal. [[Harvard University]] economics professor [[John B. Crane]] responded with a rebuttal, published in ''National Aeronautic Magazine'' in December 1936. The next year Randolph expanded the article, together with additional research, into a book titled ''Lost flights of Gustave Whitehead.'' Crane changed his mind in 1938 and suggested that a Congressional investigation should consider the claims. By 1945 Orville Wright was sufficiently concerned about the Whitehead claims that he issued his own rebuttal in ''US Air Services''.&lt;ref name="weissenb" /&gt; Then in 1949 Crane published a new article in ''Air Affairs'' magazine that supported Whitehead.&lt;ref name="brown2"&gt;Brown, J.; "Affidavit of Junius Harworth III (Gyula Horvath)", ''Gustave Whitehead - Pioneer Aviator'', www.gustave-whitehead.com [http://www.gustave-whitehead.com/history/witness-statements/junius-harworth-1934-10-07/] (retrieved 9 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crane, J.; "Early Airplane Flights Before the Wrights," ''Air Affairs'', Vol. 2, Winter, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History by contract===
Following a chance discovery in 1963, reserve U.S. Air Force major William O'Dwyer was asked to research into Whitehead. He became convinced that Whitehead did fly and contributed research material to a second book by Stella Randolph, ''The Story of Gustave Whitehead, Before the Wrights Flew'', published in 1966.&lt;ref name="Randolph1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Randolph|title=Before the Wrights Flew: The Story of Gustave Whitehead|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yc7FGAAACAAJ|year=1966|publisher=Putnam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Magazines1981"&gt;{{citation|author=Roy Bongartz Jr.|title=Was Whitehead first?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9tkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA73|periodical=Popular Mechanics |date=December 1981|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=73|issn=00324558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Dwyer and Randolph co-authored another book, ''[[History by Contract]]'', published in 1978. The book criticised the Smithsonian Institution for its contracted obligation to credit only the 1903 Wright Flyer for the first powered controlled flight, claiming that it created a conflict of interest and had been kept secret. The Smithsonian defended itself vigorously.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===''Jane's'' renews controversy===
On 8 March 2013 the aviation annual ''Jane's All the World's Aircraft'' published an editorial by Paul Jackson endorsing the Whitehead claim.&lt;ref name="jane2013"&gt;''Jane's all the world's aircraft'', 2013 edition, editorial. ([http://www.gustave-whitehead.com/history/jane-s-foreword-march-8-2013/ with highlighting], retrieved 1 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson's editorial drew heavily upon information provided by aviation researcher John Brown, whom he complimented for his work. Brown had begun researching Whitehead's aircraft while working as a contractor for the Smithsonian. ''Jane's'' corporate owner later distanced itself from the editorial, stating it contained the views of the editor, not the publisher.&lt;ref name="naha_2015_04_26"&gt;[https://www.aviationheritagearea.org/janes-backs-off-gustave-whitehead-claim/ "Jane's backs off Gustave Whitehead claim,"] 17 April 2015, ''NAHA News,'' National Aviation Heritage Alliance&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Caroll F., [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carroll-f-gray/janes-points-finger-at-editor_b_7122070.html Jane's Points Finger at Editor] Huffington Post. Retrieved 14 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown analysed in great detail a vintage photograph of an early indoor aeronautical exhibition, claiming that an even earlier photograph visible on the wall showed the Whitehead No. 21 aircraft in powered flight.&lt;ref name="brown1"&gt;Brown, J.; "Detailed Photo Analysis", ''Gustave Whitehead - Pioneer Aviator'', [http://www.gustave-whitehead.com/history/detailed-photo-analysis/] (www.gustave-whitehead.com/)&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson's editorial did not mention the claim, and two weeks after its publication he stated to the press that the image was not significant to the claim of Whitehead's flight, remarking, "And that entirely spurious 'Where's the photograph?' argument.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gustave-whitehead.com/history/paul-jackson-explains-reasoning/ Paul Jackson explains his reasoning], gustave-whitehead.com&lt;/ref&gt; Aviation historian Carroll Gray subsequently identified the photo seen on the wall "beyond any reasonable doubt" as a glider built and displayed in California by aviation pioneer [[John J. Montgomery]].&lt;ref&gt;Carroll F. Gray (Ed.); [http://www.flyingmachines.org/gwinfo/newphoto.html "Update # 5: The Photographs - Whitehead Aloft They Are Not"] ''Flying Machines'' (flyingmachines.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the renewed controversy, [[Tom D. Crouch|Tom Crouch]], a  senior curator at the Smithsonian's [[National Air and Space Museum]], formally acknowledged the Wright contract, saying that it had never been a secret.&lt;ref name="crouch2013"&gt;Crouch, T.; ''[http://newsdesk.si.edu/sites/default/files/Wright-Contract.pdf The Wright-Smithsonian Contract]'', Smithsonian Institution, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated;

''Scientific American'' published a rebuttal of the Whitehead claims written by its senior copy editor Daniel C. Schlenoff, who asserted, regarding the ''Bridgeport Herald'' report, that "The consensus on the article is that it was an interesting work of fiction." &lt;ref&gt;Schlenoff, Daniel C., Scientific American, June 13, 2013, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=recent-bill-connecticut-proclaims-gustave-whitehead-first-fly-not-wright-brothers "Connecticut Proclaims Gustave Whitehead Flew before the Wright Brothers"] Retrieved June 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-eight air historians and journalists also responded to the revived controversy with a "Statement Regarding The Gustave Whitehead Claims of Flight," rejecting the evidence supporting the claims and noting that, "When it comes to the case of Gustave Whitehead, the decision must remain, not proven."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flyingmachines.org/gwinfo/ Gustave Whitehead], flyingmachines.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Langley==
[[File:Samuel Pierpont Langley - Potomac experiment 1903.jpeg|thumb|Langley's first failure]]
Samuel Pierpont Langley was Secretary to the Smithsonian Institution from 1887 until the year of his death in 1906. During this period, and in due course supported by the United States War Department, he conducted aeronautical experiments, culminating in his manned [[Langley Aerodrome|Aerodrome A]]. Under Langley's instruction [[Charles M. Manly]] attempted to fly the craft from a catapult on the roof of a houseboat in 1903. Two attempts, on 7 October and 8 December, both failed with Manley receiving a soaking each time.&lt;ref name="wragg" /&gt;

===Glenn Curtiss and the Smithsonian===
Some ten years later in 1914 [[Glenn Curtiss]] modified the Aerodrome and flew it a few hundred feet, as part of his attempt to fight a patent owned by the Wright brothers, and as an effort by the Smithsonian to rescue Langley's aeronautical reputation. The Curtiss flights emboldened the Smithsonian to display the Aerodrome in its museum as "the first man-carrying aeroplane in the history of the world capable of sustained free flight". Fred Howard, extensively documenting the controversy, wrote: "It was a lie pure and simple, but it bore the imprimatur of the venerable Smithsonian and over the years would find its way into magazines, history books, and encyclopedias, much to the annoyance of those familiar with the facts."&lt;ref&gt;Howard, F.; ''Wilbur and Orville: A Biography of the Wright Brothers'', Dover 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smithsonian's action triggered a decades-long feud with the surviving Wright brother, Orville. It was not until 1942 that the Smithsonian finally relented, publishing the Aerodrome modifications made by Curtiss and recanting misleading statements it had made about the 1914 tests.&lt;ref name="honious"&gt;Honious, Ann. 2003, [http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/daav/appendix-c.htm "What Dreams We Have, Appendix C – Tests of the Langley Aerodrome."] ''nps.gov.'' Retrieved: September 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wrights==
[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|In the air on 17 December 1903]]
On 17 December 1903 a few miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina the [[Wright brothers]] launched their airplane from a dolly running along a short rail, which was laid on level ground. Taking turns, Orville and Wilbur made four brief flights at an altitude of about ten feet each time. The flight paths were all essentially straight; turns were not attempted. Each flight ended in a bumpy and unintended "landing" on the undercarriage skids, or runners as the craft did not have wheels. The last flight, by Wilbur, was 852 feet (260 m) in 59 seconds, much longer than each of the three previous flights of 120, 175 and 200 feet. The Flyer moved forward under its own engine power and was not assisted by catapult, a device the brothers did use during flight tests in the next two years and at public demonstrations in the U.S. and Europe in 1908-1909. A headwind averaging about 20&amp;nbsp;mph gave the machine sufficient airspeed to become airborne; its speed over the ground was less than 10&amp;nbsp;mph. Photographs were taken of the machine in flight.

The Wrights kept detailed logs and diaries about their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/wilbur-and-orville-wright-papers/about-this-collection/|title=About this Collection - Wilbur and Orville Wright Papers at the Library of Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/wri/|title=Wright Brothers Negatives - About this Collection|date=1 January 1897|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corescholar.libraries.wright.edu/special_ms1/|title=Wright Brothers Collection (MS-1) - Wright State University Research - CORE Scholar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dayton Metro Library&lt;/ref&gt; Their correspondence with Octave Chanute provides a virtual history of their efforts to invent a flying machine. They also documented their work in photographs, although they did not make public any photos of their powered flights until 1908. Their written records also were not made available to the public at the time, though they were published in 1953 after the Wright estate donated them to the U.S. [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Book Reviews The Papers of Wilbur and Orville Wright. |url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/348353 |website=University of Chicago Press Journals |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wrights' claim to a historic first flight was largely accepted by U.S. newspapers but inaccurately reported initially. In January 1904 they issued a statement to newspapers accurately describing the flights. After an announced public demonstration in May 1904 in Dayton, the Wrights made no further effort to publicize their work, and were advised by their patent attorney to keep details of their machine confidential. In 1905 a few dozen people witnessed flights by the [[Wright Flyer III]]. Pioneers such as [[Octave Chanute]] and the British Army officer Lt. Col. John Capper were among those who believed the Wrights' public and private statements about their flights.&lt;ref name="walkerII" /&gt;

In 1906, almost three years after the first flights, the U.S. Army rejected an approach from the Wrights on the basis that their proposed machine's ability to fly had not been demonstrated.&lt;ref name="walkerII" /&gt;

By 1907 the Wrights' claims were accepted widely enough for them to be in negotiations with Britain, France and Germany as well as their own government, and early in 1908 they concluded contracts with both the US War Department and a French syndicate. In May Wilbur sailed for Europe in order to carry out acceptance trials for the French contract. On 4 July 1908 Glenn Curtiss gave the first widely publicised public demonstration of flight in the USA. As a result, the Wright brothers' prestige fell. Subsequent flights of both brothers that year went on to astonish the world and their early claims gained almost universal public recognition as legitimate.&lt;ref name="walkerII" /&gt;

Subsequent criticisms of the Wrights have included accusations of secrecy before coming to Europe in 1908, the use of a catapult-assisted launch and such a lack of aerodynamic stability as to make the machine almost unflyable. 

===The Smithsonian feud===
{{Main article|Wright brothers#Smithsonian feud}}
Following the Curtiss experiments with the Langley Aerodrome in 1914, surviving Wright brother Orville began a long and bitter campaign against the Smithsonian to gain recognition.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} His disgust reached such a peak in 1928 that he sent the historic Flyer for display in the British [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum in London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1948/1948%20-%201791.html |title=Back to the Beginning |journal=Flight |date=28 October 1948 |page=505}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1942 that the Smithsonian finally relented, at last retracting its claims for Langley and acknowledging the Wrights' place in history.&lt;ref name="honious" /&gt;

Orville died on January 30, 1948. The Flyer - delayed by the war and an arrangement for a copy to be made - was returned to its native America and put on display in the Smithsonian. A clause in the contract required the Smithsonian to claim primacy for the Wrights, at risk of losing their newly acquired prize exhibit. The Smithsonian has honoured its contract ever since and continues to support the Wrights' claim.&lt;ref name="crouch2013"/&gt;

==Santos-Dumont==
[[File:14-bis de Alberto Santos Dumont.jpg|thumb|The 14-Bis seen from the front, before it was fitted with ailerons]]
[[Alberto Santos-Dumont]] was a Brazilian aviation pioneer of French ancestry. Having emigrated to France for studies, he made his aeronautical name in that country with [[airship]]s before turning to heavier-than-air flight. On 23 October 1906 he flew his [[14-bis]] biplane for a distance of 60&amp;nbsp;metres (197&amp;nbsp;ft) at a height of about five meters or less (15&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="gs-haf" /&gt; The flight was officially observed and verified by the Aéro-Club (later renamed the [[Aéro-Club de France]]). This won Santos-Dumont the Deutsch-Archdeacon Prize for the first officially-observed flight of more than 25&amp;nbsp;meters. This flight is also recognised as the first powered flight in Europe. Then on 12 November a flight of 22.2 seconds carried the 14-bis some 220&amp;nbsp;m (722&amp;nbsp;ft), earning the Aéro-Club prize of 1,500 francs for the first flight of more than 100 m.&lt;ref name="a&amp;m"&gt;Angelucci &amp; Marticardi (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; This flight was also observed by the newly formed [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) and became the first record in their log book.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The lateral control system comprised [[aileron]]s mounted between the wings and attached to a harness worn by the pilot, who was intended to correct any rolling movement by leaning in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name="a&amp;m" /&gt; Both flights ended when the craft began to roll and Santos-Dumont landed because he was unable to correct it. This has led some critics to question the lateral control capability of the 14-bis, however it has not prevented the flight from being recognised.&lt;ref name="wbo"&gt;[http://www.wright-brothers.org/History_Wing/History_of_the_Airplane/Who_Was_First/Who_Was_First_Intro/Who_Was_First_Intro.htm Who Was First?], wright-brothers.org (retrieved 6 October 2014): "Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont flew his 14-Bis near Paris, France in the fall of 1906. In October, his best flight covered 196 feet (60 meters); in November, he stretched that to 721 feet (220 meters). Both flights ended when his aircraft entered a roll that Santos-Dumont could not stop and he decided to land, so there is some controversy whether or not these were completely controlled flights. Nonetheless, they are counted as the first "official" flights in Europe."&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the Wrights' claim had not yet been accepted in Europe and was questioned in America by the authoritative ''[[Scientific American]]''. Thus, Santos-Dumont was credited by many with the first powered flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.rankbrasil.com.br/Recordes/Materias/06xV/Primeiro_Aviao_Do_Mundo |title=Primeiro avião do mundo| journal=Rank Brasil |date=20 July 2012 |page=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minor claims==
[[File:Richard-William-Pearse-Monument.jpg|thumb|right|Richard William Pearse Monument]]
[[File:JathoAirplanePhotoPortrait.gif|thumb|Jatho biplane]]
In 1894 Sir Hiram Maxim tested a flying machine running on a track and held down by safety rails because it lacked adequate flight control. The machine lifted off the track and met the safety rails and this is sometimes claimed as a flight. Maxim himself never made such a claim.&lt;ref name="gs-haf" /&gt;

John Hall, of Springfield, Massachusetts was credited, alongside Whitehead, with flights prior to the Wrights by Crane in his 1947 ''Air Affairs'' magazine article.&lt;ref name="brown2" /&gt;

Preston A. Watson was subject of a claim made in 1953 by his brother J.Y. Watson, that he had flown before the Wrights in 1903. J.Y. Watson later admitted that this was in an unpowered glider.&lt;ref name="gs-haf" /&gt;

A '''colloid thruster''' (or "[[electrospray]] thruster") is a type of low thrust [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] [[rocket engine]] that uses electrostatic acceleration of charged liquid droplets for propulsion. In a [[colloid]] thruster, charged liquid droplets are produced by an electrospray process and then accelerated by a static electric field. The liquid used for this application tends to be a low-volatility [[ionic liquid]].

Like other [[ion thruster]]s, its benefits include high efficiency, thrust density, and [[specific impulse]]; however it has very low total thrust, on the order of [[Newton (unit)|micronewtons]]. It provides very fine [[attitude control]] or efficient acceleration of small spacecraft over long periods of time.

==Flight use==
Eight electrospray thrusters were first used in space on the NASA ST-7 [[LISA Pathfinder|ESA LISA Pathfinder]] mission, to demonstrate disturbance reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ST7 Lisa Pathfinder| url = http://busek.com/flightprograms__st7.htm| website = busek.com| accessdate = 2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having logged roughly 1,400 hours on-orbit, the [[Busek]] built thrusters system met 100% of their mission goals for the LISA Pathfinder mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6676 NASA Microthrusters Achieve Success on ESA's LISA Pathfinder]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
By the end of April 2015, [[Busek]] had developed a smaller electrospray colloid thruster capable of generating 20&amp;nbsp;mN in a 17.8 x 17.8 x 4.3&amp;nbsp;cm  (7"×7"×1.7") package.&lt;ref&gt;[http://techport.nasa.gov/view/9310 20mN, Variable Specific Impulse Colloid Thruster, Phase II Project]. 2015. NASA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==

In July 2013, scientists from [[Michigan Technological University]] and the [[University of Maryland]] led by Kurt Terhune demonstrated an electrospray system within a [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM). This led to the discovery that the TEM environment formed needle-like structures on the thruster disrupting the way the electrospray system works.&lt;ref name="2016-08-08_MTU"&gt;[http://www.mtu.edu/news/stories/2016/august/watch-tiny-space-rocket-work.html Watch a Tiny Space Rocket Work], Allison Mills, [[Michigan Tech]], 8 August 2016, accessed 11 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[SkyFire (spacecraft)|SkyFire]] nanosatellite, to be launched in 2019 for a lunar flyby, will demonstrate the use of this propulsion system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/next-space-technologies-for-exploration-partnerships-nextstep-projects |title=Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) Projects |work=NASA |publisher=NASA |date=May 5, 2015 |accessdate=2016-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident''' is a 1986 [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) [[treaty]] whereby states have agreed to provide notification of any [[nuclear and radiation accidents|nuclear accident]] that occur within its jurisdiction that could affect other states. It, along with the [[Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency]], was adopted in direct response to the April 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]].

By agreeing to the Convention, a state acknowledges that when any nuclear or radiation accident occurs within its territory that has the potential of affecting another state, it will promptly notify the IAEA and the other states that could be affected. The information to be reported includes the incident's time, location, and the suspected amount of radioactivity release.

The Convention was concluded and signed at a special session of the IAEA general conference on 26 September 1986; the special session was called because of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], which had occurred five months before. Significantly, the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Ukrainian SSR]]—the states that were responsible for the Chernobyl disaster—both signed the treaty at the conference and quickly ratified it. It was signed by 69 states and the Convention entered into force on 27 October 1986 after the third ratification.

As of 2015, 119 state parties have ratified the Convention; the [[European Atomic Energy Community]], the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], the [[World Health Organization]], and the [[World Meteorological Organization]] have also entered into the Convention. The states that have ratified the Convention but have since denounced it and withdrawn from the agreement are [[Bulgaria]], [[Hungary]], [[Mongolia]], and [[Poland]]. The states that have signed the Convention but not ratified it are [[Bahamas]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Holy See]], [[Niger]], [[North Korea]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], and [[Zimbabwe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3576">The '''Defense Treaty Ready Inspection Readiness Program''' (DTIRP) is a [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) security preparedness and outreach program designed to provide security education and awareness concerning the operational activities associated with [[arms control]] implementation. DTIRP uses specially trained personnel, analyses, and educational activities to provide arms control implementation advice and assistance to facilities subject to on-site inspection activities and observation overflights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About DTIRP |url=http://dtirp.dtra.mil/DTIRP/about_dtirp.aspx |publisher=Defense Treaty Ready Inspection Readiness Program |accessdate=3 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103203003/http://dtirp.dtra.mil/DTIRP/about_dtirp.aspx |archivedate=3 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authority for the DTIRP outreach program is provided by Department of Defense Instruction (USDI) 5205.10, Department of Defense Treaty Inspection Readiness Program (DTIRP). This Directive states the purpose of the DTIRP outreach program as being to ensure the continued protection of Department of Defense (DoD) programs, operations, and activities by providing security preparedness education, assistance, and advice concerning the wide range of operational activities associated with implementing [[arms control]] treaties and agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About DTIRP Authority |url=http://dtirp.dtra.mil/DTIRP/authority.aspx |publisher=Defense Treaty Ready Inspection Readiness Program |accessdate=3 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103202913/http://dtirp.dtra.mil/DTIRP/authority.aspx |archivedate=3 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The precursor to the DTIRP outreach program was the [[Defense Contractor Inspection Readiness Program]] (DCIRP). DCIRP was established in August 1990 by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Security Policy to assist the defense contractor community with developing and implementing effective security countermeasures at facilities subject to inspection under the [[START I|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]] (START).&lt;ref name=Origin&gt;{{cite web|title=About DTIRP:Origin and Evolution |url=http://dtirp.dtra.mil/DTIRP/orgin_and_evolution.aspx |publisher=Defense Treaty Ready Inspection Readiness Program |accessdate=8 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103212653/http://dtirp.dtra.mil/DTIRP/orgin_and_evolution.aspx |archivedate=3 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1991, DCIRP was reorganized, renamed "DTIRP," and transferred to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence [ASD(C3I)]. The new name, Defense Treaty Inspection Readiness Program (DTIRP), reflected the expansion of DTIRP's mission to include DoD facilities, in addition to defense contractor facilities, and to include other arms control treaties and agreements in addition to START.&lt;ref name=Origin /&gt;

Although the scope of DTIRP's mission expanded, its focus remained the same:

An '''electrochemical cell''' is a device capable of either generating [[electrical energy]] from [[chemical reaction]]s or using electrical energy to cause chemical reactions. The electrochemical cells which generate an electric current are called [[Galvanic cell|voltaic cells]] or [[Galvanic cell|galvanic cells]] and the other ones are called [[Electrolytic cell|electrolytic cells]] which are used to drive chemical reactions like [[electrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Chemical/electrolyt.html#c1|title=Electrolytic Cells|website=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Chemical/electrochem.html#c3|title=Electrochemical Cells|last=|first=|date=|website=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-17|quote=Electrochemical cells which generate an electric current are called voltaic cells or galvanic cells, and common batteries consist of one or more such cells.

A [[Battery (electricity)|''battery'']] consists of one or more cells, connected either in [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel, series]] or series-and-parallel pattern.&lt;r: A cell is a device which can convert chemical energy into electrical energy. A simple cell does this by using a combination of two metals (electrodes) and an electrolyte solution (which could be acid/alkali/salt solution).
Metals can conduct electricity due to metallic bonding. Metallic bonds are the electrostatic force of attraction between negatively charged delocalised electrons and the positively charged metal ions. Metal atoms are surrounded by a “sea” of delocalised electrons. This means they are free to move within the structure- this gives metals its conducting abilities as an electric current can flow through it. 
A reaction between metals where electrons are gained is called a reduction reaction
A reaction where electrons are lost is called a oxidation reaction 
A reaction where both reduction and oxidation occur is called a redox reaction. A redox reaction occurs when electrons are transferred from a substance that is oxidized to one that is being reduced.

[[Image:Electrolyser 1884.png|thumb|right|190px| Nineteenth century electrolytic cell for producing [[oxyhydrogen]].]]
An electrolytic cell is an electrochemical cell that drives a non-spontaneous [[redox]] reaction through the application of electrical energy. They are often used to decompose chemical compounds, in a process called [[electrolysis]]—the Greek word [[lysis]] means ''to break up''.

Important examples of electrolysis are the decomposition of [[water]] into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], and [[bauxite]] into [[aluminium]] and other chemicals. Electroplating (e.g. of copper, silver, nickel or chromium) is done  using an electrolytic cell. Electrolysis is a technique that uses a direct electric current (DC).

An electrolytic cell has three component parts: an [[electrolyte]] and two electrodes (a [[cathode]] and an [[anode]]). The [[electrolyte]] is usually a [[solution]] of [[water]] or other [[solvent]]s in which ions are dissolved. Molten salts such as [[sodium chloride]] are also electrolytes. When driven by an external [[voltage]] applied to the electrodes, the ions in the electrolyte are attracted to an electrode with the opposite charge, where charge-transferring (also called faradaic or redox) reactions can take place. Only with an external [[electrical potential]] (i.e. voltage) of correct polarity and sufficient magnitude can an electrolytic cell decompose a normally stable, or [[Chemically inert|inert]] chemical compound in the solution. The electrical energy provided can produce a chemical reaction which would not occur spontaneously otherwise.

== Galvanic cell ==
[[File:Galvanic cell with no cation flow.png|right|thumb|Galvanic cell with no cation flow]]
{{Main|Galvanic cell}}
A galvanic cell, or voltaic cell, named after [[Luigi Galvani]], or [[Alessandro Volta]] respectively, is an electrochemical cell that derives electrical energy from spontaneous [[redox]] reactions taking place within the cell. It generally consists of two different metals connected by a [[salt bridge]], or individual half-cells separated by a porous membrane.

Volta was the inventor of the [[voltaic pile]], the first [[Battery (electricity)|electrical battery]]. In common usage, the word "battery" has come to include a single galvanic cell, but a battery properly consists of multiple cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/battery "battery" (def. 4b)], ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary'' (2008). Retrieved 6 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary cell ==
{{main|primary cell}}
A primary cell is a Galvanic [[battery (electricity)|battery]] that is designed to be used once and discarded, and not recharged with electricity and reused like a secondary cell ([[rechargeable battery]]).  In general, the [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] [[chemical reaction|reaction]] occurring in the cell is not reversible, rendering the cell unrechargeable.  As a primary cell is used, [[chemical reaction]]s in the battery use up the chemicals that generate the power; when they are gone, the battery stops producing electricity and is useless. In contrast, in a [[secondary cell]], the reaction can be reversed by running a current into the cell with a [[battery charger]] to recharge it, regenerating the chemical reactants.  Primary cells are made in a range of standard sizes to power small household appliances such as [[flashlight]]s and portable radios.  

Primary batteries make up about 90% of the $50 billion battery market, but secondary batteries have been gaining market share.  About 15 billion primary batteries are thrown away worldwide every year, virtually all ending up in landfills.  Due to the toxic [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s and strong acids or alkalis they contain, batteries are [[hazardous waste]].  Most municipalities classify them as such and require separate disposal.   The energy needed to manufacture a battery is about 50 times greater than the energy it contains.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Due to their high pollutant content compared to their small energy content, the primary battery is considered a wasteful, environmentally unfriendly technology.  Due mainly to increasing sales of [[wireless device]]s and [[cordless|cordless tools]] which cannot be economically powered by primary batteries and come with integral rechargeable batteries, the secondary battery industry has high growth and has slowly been replacing the primary battery in high end products.

== Secondary cell ==
{{main|Rechargeable battery}}
A secondary cell, commonly referred to as a ''rechargeable battery'' is an electrochemical cell that can be run as both a galvanic cell or as an electrolytic cell. This is used as a convenient way to store electricity, when current flows one way the levels of one or more chemicals build up (charging), while it is discharging they reduce and the resulting electromotive force can do work.

== Fuel cell ==
[[File:Solid oxide fuel cell protonic.svg|thumb|Scheme of a proton-conducting fuel cell]]
{{main|Fuel cell}}
A ''fuel cell'' is an electrochemical cell that converts the [[chemical energy]] from a fuel into electricity through an [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] reaction of [[hydrogen fuel]] with oxygen or another [[oxidizing agent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khurmi |first=R. S. |title=Material Science |url=http://www.biblio.com/books/436308472.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel cells are different from [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] in requiring a continuous source of fuel and oxygen (usually from air) to sustain the chemical reaction, whereas in a battery the chemical energy comes from chemicals already present in the battery. Fuel cells can produce electricity continuously for as long as fuel and oxygen are supplied.

The first fuel cells were invented in 1838. The first commercial use of fuel cells came more than a century later in [[NASA]] space programmes to generate power for [[satellites]] and [[space capsule]]s. Since then, fuel cells have been used in many other applications. Fuel cells are used for primary and backup power for commercial, industrial and residential buildings and in remote or inaccessible areas. They are also used to power [[fuel cell vehicle]]s, including forklifts, automobiles, buses, boats, motorcycles and submarines.

There are many types of fuel cells, but they all consist of an [[anode]], a [[cathode]], and an [[electrolyte]] that allows positively charged hydrogen ions (protons) to move between the two sides of the fuel cell. At the anode a catalyst causes the fuel to undergo oxidation reactions that generate protons (positively charged hydrogen ions) and electrons. The protons flow from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte after the reaction. At the same time, electrons are drawn from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit, producing [[direct current]] electricity. At the cathode, another catalyst causes hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen to react, forming water. Fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte they use and by the difference in startup time ranging from 1 second for [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell]]s (PEM fuel cells, or PEMFC) to 10 minutes for [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s (SOFC). A related technology is [[Flow battery|flow batteries]], in which the fuel can be regenerated by recharging. Individual fuel cells produce relatively small electrical potentials, about 0.7 volts, so cells are "stacked", or placed in series, to create sufficient voltage to meet an application's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Nice, Karim and Strickland, Jonathan. [http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/alternative-fuels/fuel-cell2.htm "How Fuel Cells Work: Polymer Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells"]. How Stuff Works, accessed 4 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to electricity, fuel cells produce water, heat and, depending on the fuel source, very small amounts of [[nitrogen dioxide]] and other emissions. The energy efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 40–60%; however, if waste heat is captured in a [[cogeneration]] scheme, efficiencies up to 85% can be obtained.

The fuel cell market is growing, and in 2013 Pike Research estimated that the stationary fuel cell market will reach 50 GW by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewindians.com/2013/01/stationary-fuel-cells-market-size-to-reach-350000-shipments-by-2022.html |title=Stationary Fuel Cells Market size to reach 350,000 Shipments by 2022 |work=Renew India Campaign |first=Rahul R. |last=Prabhu |date=13 January 2013 |accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Half-cells ==
{{Main|Half-cell}}
[[File:bunsen cell.jpg|thumb|The [[Bunsen cell]], invented by [[Robert Bunsen]].]]
An electrochemical cell consists of two half-cells.  Each ''half-cell'' consists of an [[electrode]] and an [[electrolyte]]. The two half-cells may use the same electrolyte, or they may use different electrolytes. The chemical reactions in the cell may involve the electrolyte, the electrodes, or an external substance (as in [[fuel cell]]s that may use hydrogen gas as a reactant). In a full electrochemical cell, species from one half-cell lose electrons ([[Redox|oxidation]]) to their [[electrode]] while species from the other half-cell gain electrons ([[Redox|reduction]]) from their electrode.

A ''[[salt bridge]]'' (e.g., filter paper soaked in KNO&lt;sub&gt;3,&lt;/sub&gt; NaCl, or some other electrolyte) is often employed to provide ionic contact between two half-cells with different electrolytes, yet prevent the solutions from mixing and causing unwanted side reactions. An alternative to a salt bridge is to allow direct contact (and mixing) between the two half-cells, for example in simple electrolysis of water.

As electrons flow from one half-cell to the other through an external circuit, a difference in charge is established. If no ionic contact were provided, this charge difference would quickly prevent the further flow of electrons. A salt bridge allows the flow of negative or positive ions to maintain a steady-state charge distribution between the oxidation and reduction vessels, while keeping the contents otherwise separate. Other devices for achieving separation of solutions are porous pots and gelled solutions. A porous pot is used in the [[Bunsen cell]] (right).

=== Equilibrium reaction ===

Each half-cell has a characteristic voltage. Various choices of substances for each half-cell give different potential differences. Each reaction is undergoing an [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] reaction between different [[oxidation states]] of the ions: When equilibrium is reached, the cell cannot provide further voltage. In the half-cell that is undergoing oxidation, the closer the equilibrium lies to the ion/atom with the more positive oxidation state the more potential this reaction will provide. Likewise, in the reduction reaction, the closer the equilibrium lies to the ion/atom with the more ''negative'' oxidation state the higher the potential.

=== Cell potential ===

The cell potential can be predicted through the use of [[electrode potential]]s (the voltages of each half-cell). These half-cell potentials are defined relative to the assignment of 0 volts to the [[standard hydrogen electrode]] (SHE). (See [[table of standard electrode potentials]]). The difference in voltage between electrode potentials gives a prediction for the potential measured. When calculating the difference in voltage, one must first rewrite the half-cell reaction equations to obtain a balanced oxidation-reduction equation.

# Reverse the reduction reaction with the smallest potential ( to create an oxidation reaction/ overall positive cell potential)
# Half-reactions must be multiplied by integers to achieve electron balance.

Cell potentials have a possible range of roughly zero to 6 volts. Cells using water-based electrolytes are usually limited to cell potentials less than about 2.5 volts due to high reactivity of the powerful oxidizing and reducing agents with water that is  needed to produce a higher voltage. Higher cell potentials are possible with cells using other solvents instead of water. For instance, [[lithium battery|lithium cells]] with a voltage of 3 volts are commonly available.

The cell potential depends on the concentration of the reactants, as well as their type. As the cell is discharged, the concentration of the reactants decreases and the cell potential also decreases.

ECTA members are some of the primary innovators in implementation of advanced telecommunications and broadband services

==History==
The '''European Competitive Telecommunications Association''' was formed in 1998 by [[Robert J. Dombkowski]] and [[Elizabeth J. Schumacher]], founders of MCN, UK, who collectively brought together a group of telecommunications resellers and suppliers in Europe in order to push for deregulation of the telecommunications market across Western and [[Eastern Europe]]. The founding members included high ranking executives of the major telecom players in Europe including [[Nick Jeffries]] of [[Cable &amp; Wireless plc|Cable and Wireless]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cableandwireless.co.uk |title=cableandwireless.co.uk |publisher=cableandwireless.co.uk |date=2011-11-15 |accessdate=2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Potter venture capitalist of [[Paradigm Ventures]] specialized in telecom start-ups and film director of [[Orphans of Apollo]], [[Hans Gerber]] of [[SITA-Equant]], Gustav Schaefer&lt;!-- careful when linking, this is also a German Olympic rower and the drummer of Tokio Hotel --&gt; of [[Unisource Carrier Services]], [[Ian Ashby]] of [[Lucent Technologies]], [[Claude Simpson]], the president of [[Immix Telecom]] (ECTA Member of the Year, 1999), Holland Taylor&lt;!-- careful when linking, this is also an American actress --&gt; of [[USA GlobalLink]], and Michael Rhodes&lt;!-- careful when linking, this is also a rugby player --&gt; of [[Coudert Brothers]].

Prior to 1987, the European telecommunications market consisted predominantly of monopolies or telecommunications organizations (TO's) such as BT, [[France Télécom|France Telecom]] and [[Deutsche Telekom]].  In 1987, [[European Union|the European Union]] adopted the 1987 [[Green paper|Green Paper]] that essentially stated it was in Europe's best interests to overhaul the current system and liberalize telecommunications services. As a result, from 1988 to 1998 [[European Commission|the European Commission]] adopted multiple directives that obligated member states to open markets for equipment, telecom services, value-added, data services, satellite, mobile and voice to competition.

Member States set up [[national regulatory agency|national regulatory agencies]] (NRA's) that oversaw these directives and developed policies and procedures for telecommunications organizations to follow. The directives provided a framework for the EU commission to ensure compliance and take judicial action when necessary. In 1990 the [[Open Network Provision]] (ONP) Framework Directive was adopted by the EU that established regulations for open access to the existing infrastructure and networks, interconnection and 'fair pricing' for resellers.

ECTA was established as a result of restrictive practices by former monopolies to limit activities by resellers to access networks and obtain fair pricing. Committees were established within the organization to collectively respond to new [[European Union directive|EU directives]] and written and 'unwritten' policies that were carried out by NRA's.  ECTA responded to numerous proposed directives and called for regulations to be developed to better protect reseller interests and encourage enforcement in the spirit of the original 1987 Green Paper. ECTA has contributed [[white paper]]s and had input into many policy telecom policies since its inception in 1997.

ECTA also serves as a forum for carriers and resellers to meet and discuss openly issues that are in the interests of the parties. ECTA has also served to educate the telecommunications market, providing information and [[market research]] on European telecommunications as well as a market forum for new products and services.

==Aims &amp; Objectives==
*Assist and encourage market liberalisation and competition
*Represent the telecommunications industry to key government and regulatory bodies 
*Maintain a forum for networking and business development throughout Europe 
*Assist new market entrants through pro-competitive policies 
*Continually reflect the dynamic nature of the telecommunications industry

===Core Principles===

*Consumers are best protected by competition 
*Service development is driven by consumer choice  
*Regulation should create confidence  
*Tariffs should be reasonable and straightforward  
*Regulators should not pick winners or losers  
*Incumbents must not be allowed to prevent competition 
*Pan-European solutions are needed for Pan-European problems

===Board of Directors 2016===
* Gijs Phoelich, General Counsel &amp; Company Secretary, Eurofiber Netherlands BV (Chairman)

ECTA holds two events a year to discuss the latest developments in electronic communications and digital issues as a whole. The list of past ECTA events and conferences can be found on their website.

In March 2015, ECTA sponsored a conference in presence of Vice-President of the European Commission Andrus Ansip. The title of this conference was "Creating Europe’s Digital Highways: Competition, Innovation and Investment in High-speed Broadband". The statements of the speakers as well as their video interviews including the speech from Marvin Ammori&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ammori.org/|title=Marvin Ammori|work=Marvin Ammori}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Centre for Internet and Society]] at [[Stanford Law School]] can be found on  website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ectaportal.com/en/EVENTS/European-Voice-event-sponsored-by-ECTA/|title=ECTA / EVENTS / European Voice event sponsored by ECTA|work=ectaportal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current priority of the European Commission is to foster investments in telecom infrastructures in order to build a Connected Digital Single Market. Vice-President [[Andrus Ansip]], released on 6 May with Commissioner [[Günther Oettinger]] a Digital Single Market Strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/index_en.htm|title=Digital Single Market|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ECTA CEOs welcomed in an open letter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ectaportal.com/en/upload/File/Press_Releases/2015/ECTA_DSM_WELCOME_letter_Juncker_Commission%20May%206%20webv3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=February 2017}}

A '''floor''' is the bottom surface of a room or vehicle or even possibly the surface on which people dance, commonly referred to as a 'dance floor'. Floors vary from [[wikt:hovel|simple dirt]] in a cave to many-layered surfaces modern technology. Floors may be stone, wood, bamboo, metal or any other material that can support the expected load.

The levels of a building are often referred to as floors, although a more proper term is [[storey]].

Floors typically consist of a subfloor for support and a floor covering used to give a good walking surface. In modern buildings the subfloor often has electrical wiring, plumbing, and other services built in. As floors must meet many needs, some essential to safety, floors are built to strict [[building code]]s in some regions.

== Special floor structures ==
[[File:Floor Glass Auckland Skycity.jpg|thumb|Floors may incorporate glass, mosaic or other artistic expression.]]
Where a special floor structure like a [[floating floor]] is laid upon another floor then both may be referred to as subfloors.

Special floor structures are used for a number of purposes:

* [[Balcony]], a platform projecting from a wall
* [[Floating floor]], normally for noise or vibration reduction
* [[Glass floor]], as in glass bottomed elevators
* [[Nightingale floor]] makes a noise when an intruder walks on it
* [[Raised floor]], utilities underneath can be accessed easily
* [[Sprung floor]], improves the performance and safety of athletes and dancers

== Floor covering ==
{{Main|Flooring}}

'''Floor covering''' is a term to generically describe any finish material applied over a floor structure to provide a walking surface. '''Flooring''' is the general term for a permanent covering of a floor, or for the work of installing such a floor covering. Both terms are used interchangeably but floor covering refers more to loose-laid materials.

Materials almost always classified as floor covering include [[carpet]], area [[Rug making|rugs]], and resilient flooring such as [[linoleum]] or [[Vinyl composition tile|vinyl]] flooring.  Materials commonly called [[flooring]] include [[wood flooring]], laminated wood, [[ceramic tile]], [[Masonry|stone]], [[terrazzo]], and various seamless chemical floor coatings.

The choice of material for floor covering is affected by factors such as cost, endurance, noise insulation, comfort and cleaning effort. Some types of flooring must not be installed below grade (lower than ground level), and laminate or hardwood should be avoided where there may be moisture or condensation.

The subfloor may be finished in a way that makes it usable without any extra work, see: 
* [[Earthen floor]] adobe or [[clay]] floors
* [[Solid ground floor]] cement screed or granolithic

There are a number of special features that may be used to [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]] a floor or perform a useful service. Examples include [[Floor medallions]] which provide a decorative centerpiece of a floor design, or [[Grating]]s used to drain water or to rub dirt off shoes.

== Subfloor construction ==
Floors may be built on [[Beam (structure)|beam]]s or [[joist]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZDpdupFBoQC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=%C2%A0Floors+may+be+built+on+beams+or+joists&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3qsPC1azVAhXjrlQKHZc4D5o4ChDoAQgvMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Floors%20may%20be%20built%20on%20beams%20or%20joists&amp;f=false|title=Wood Frame House Construction|last=Anderson|first=L. O.|date=April 2002|publisher=The Minerva Group, Inc.|isbn=9780894991677|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or use structures like prefabricated [[hollow core slab]]s. The subfloor builds on those and attaches by various means particular to the support structure but the support and subfloor together always provides the strength of a floor one can sense underfoot. Nowadays, subfloors are generally made from at least two layers of moisture resistant ('AC' grade, one side finished and sanded flat) [[plywood]] or composite sheeting, jointly also termed ''Underlayments'' on floor [[joist]]s of 2x8, 2x10, or 2x12's ([[Lumber#Dimensional lumber|dimensional lumber]]) spaced generally on {{convert|16|in|cm|1|adj=on}} centers, in the United States and Canada. Some flooring components used solely on concrete slabs consist of a dimpled rubberized or plastic layer much like bubble wrap that provide little tiny pillars for the {{convert|1/2|in|mm|1|adj=on|spell=in}} sheet material above. These are manufactured in {{convert|2|x|2|ft|cm|0|abbr=on}} squares and the edges fit together like a [[mortise and tenon]] joint. Like a floor on joists not on concrete, a second sheeting underlayment layer is added with staggered joints to disperse forces that would open a joint under the stress of live loads like a person walking.

Three layers are common only in high end highest quality construction. The two layers in high quality construction will both be thick {{convert|3/4|in|mm|1}} sheets (as will the third when present), but the two layers may achieve a combined  thickness of only half-that in cheaper construction &amp;mdash; {{convert|1/2|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} panel overlaid by {{convert|1/4|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} plywood subflooring. At the highest end,  or in select rooms of the building there might well be three sheeting layers, and such stiff subflooring is necessary to prevent the cracking of large floor tiles of {{convert|9|-|10|in|cm|1}} or more on a side, and the structure under such a floor will frequently also have extra 'bracing' and 'blocking' joist-to-joist intended spread the weight to have as little sagging on any joist as possible when there is a live load on the floor above.

In Europe and North America only a few rare floors will be seen to have no separate floor covering on top, and those are normally because of a temporary condition pending sales or occupancy; in semi-custom new construction and some rental markets, such floors are provided for the new home buyer (renter) to select their own preferred floor coverings usually a wall to wall carpet, or one piece vinyl floor covering. Wood clad ('[[Hardwood]]') and tile covered finished floors generally will require a stiffer higher quality subfloor, especially for the later class. Since the wall base and flooring interact forming a joint, such later added semi-custom floors will generally not be hardwood for that joint construction would be in the wrong order unless the wall base trim was also delayed pending the choosing.

The subfloor may also provide [[underfloor heating]] and if floor radiant heating is not used, will certainly suffer puncture openings to be put through for [[Duct (HVAC)|forced air duct]]s for both heating and [[air conditioning]], or pipe holes for ''forced hot water'' or ''steam heating'' transport piping conveying the heat from furnace to the local room's [[heat exchanger]]s (radiators).

Some sub-floors are inset below the top surface level of surrounding flooring's joists and such subfloors and a normal height joist are joined to make a plywood box both molding and containing at least {{convert|2|in|cm|0|spell=in}} of concrete (A 'Mud Floor' in builders parlance). Alternatively, only a slightly inset floor topped by a fibrous mesh and concrete building composite floor cladding is used for smaller high quality tile floors&amp;mdash;these 'concrete' subfloors have a good thermal match with ceramic tiles and so are popular with builders constructing kitchen, laundry and especially both common and high end bathrooms and any other room where large expanses of well supported ceramic tile will be used as a finished floor. Floors using small ({{convert|4.5|in|cm|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} and smaller) ceramic tiles generally use only an additional {{convert|1/4|in|mm|1|adj=on}} layer of plywood (if that) and substitute adhesive and substrate materials making do with both a flexible joints and semi-flexible mounting compounds and so are designed to withstand the greater flexing which large tiles cannot tolerate without breaking.

=== Ground floor construction ===
{{Main|Solid ground floor}}

A ground-level floor can be an earthen floor made of [[soil]], or be [[solid ground floor]]s made of [[concrete slab]].

Ground level slab floors are uncommon in northern latitudes where freezing provides significant structural problems, except in heated interior spaces such as basements or for outdoor unheated structures such as a gazebo or shed where unitary temperatures are not creating pockets of troublesome meltwaters. Ground-level slab floors are prepared for pouring by [[grading (construction)|grading]] the site, which usually also involves removing topsoil and other organic materials well away from the slab site. Once the site has reached a suitable firm inorganic base material that is graded further so that it is flat and level, and then topped by spreading a layer-cake of force dispersing sand and gravel. Deeper channels may be dug, especially the slab ends and across the slab width at regular intervals in which a continuous run of rebar is bent and wired to sit at two heights within forming a sub-slab 'concrete girder'. Above the targeted bottom height (coplanar with the compacted sand and gravel topping) a separate grid of [[rebar]] or welded wire mesh is usually added to [[reinforced concrete|reinforce the concrete]], and will be tied to the under slab 'girder' rebar at intervals. The under slab cast girders are used especially if it the slab be used structurally, i.e. to support part of the building.

=== Upper floor construction ===
[[File:Katowice - new Central Station, construction 04.JPG|thumb|Multi-floor construction, [[Katowice]] (2012)]]
Floors in [[Framing (construction)|wood-frame homes]] are usually constructed with joists centered no more than {{convert|16|in|cm|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} apart, according to most [[building code]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Heavy floors, such as those made of [[Masonry|stone]], require more closely spaced joists. If the [[Span (architecture)|span]] between load-bearing walls is too long for joists to safely support, then a heavy crossbeam (thick or [[laminate]]d wood, or a metal [[I-beam]] or [[H-beam]]) may be used. A "subfloor" of [[plywood]] or [[waferboard]] is then laid over the joists.

=== Utilities ===
{{Main|Building services engineering}}

In modern buildings, there are numerous services provided via ducts or wires underneath the floor or above the [[ceiling]]. The floor of one level typically also holds the ceiling of the level below (if any).

Services provided by subfloors include:

* [[Air conditioning]]
* [[Telecommunication|Communication fibers]]
* [[Electrical wiring]]
* [[Compartmentalization (fire protection)|Fire protection]]
* [[Thermal insulation]]
* [[Plumbing]]
* [[sanitary sewer|Sewerage]]
* [[Soundproofing]]
* [[Underfloor heating]]

In floors supported by joists, [[Public utility|utilities]] are run through the floor by drilling small holes through the joists to serve as conduits.  Where the floor is over the basement or [[Basement#Crawl space|crawlspace]], utilities may instead be run under the joists, making the installation less expensive. Also, ducts for air conditioning (central heating and cooling) are large and cannot cross through joists or beams; thus, ducts are typically at or near the [[HVAC#Plenum space|plenum]], or come directly from underneath (or from an attic).

Pipes for plumbing, sewerage, underfloor heating, and other utilities may be laid directly in slab floors, typically via [[cellular floor raceways]]. However, later maintenance of these systems can be expensive, requiring the opening of concrete or other fixed structures. Electrically heated floors are available, and both kinds of systems can also be used in wood floors as well.

== Problems with floors ==
Wood floors, particularly older ones, will tend to 'squeak' in certain places. This is caused by the wood rubbing against other wood, usually at a [[Joint (building)|joint]] of the subfloor. Firmly securing the pieces to each other with [[screw]]s or [[nail (fastener)|nails]] may reduce this problem.

[[Floor vibration]] is a problem with floors. Wood floors tend to pass sound, particularly heavy footsteps and low [[Low-frequency effect|bass frequencies]]. [[Floating floor]]s can reduce this problem. Concrete floors are usually so massive they do not have this problem, but they are also much more expensive to construct and must meet more stringent building requirements due to their weight.

Floors with a chemical sealer, like stained concrete or epoxy finishes, usually have a slick finish presenting a potential slip and fall hazard, however there are anti skid additives and coatings which can help mitigate this and provide increased traction. Reliable, science-backed [[floor slip resistance testing]] can help floor owners and designers determine if their floor is too slippery, or allow them to choose an appropriate flooring for the intended purpose before installation.

The flooring may need protection sometimes. A [[gym floor cover]] can be used to reduce the need to satisfy incompatible requirements.

{{Main|Floor cleaning}}
[[Floor cleaning]] is a major [[employment|occupation]] throughout the world and has been since ancient times. Cleaning is essential to prevent injuries due to slips and to remove dirt. Floors are also treated to protect or beautify the surface. The correct method to clean one type of floor can often damage another, so it is important to use the correct treatment.

'''Fractional-order control (FOC)''' is a field of [[control theory]] that uses the [[fractional-order integrator]] as part of the [[control system]] design toolkit.

The fundamental advantage of FOC is that the fractional-order integrator weights history using a function that decays with a [[power-law tail]]. The effect is that the effects of all time are computed for each iteration of the control algorithm. This creates a 'distribution of time constants,' the upshot of which is there is no particular time constant, or [[resonance frequency]], for the system.

In fact, the fractional integral operator &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{s^{\lambda}}&lt;/math&gt; is different from any integer-order rational [[transfer function]] &lt;math&gt; {G_{I}} (s)&lt;/math&gt;, in the sense that it is a non-local operator that possesses an infinite memory and takes into account the whole history of its input signal.&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Tavazoei, M. Haeri, S. Bolouki, and M. Siami, "Stability preservation analysis for frequency-based methods in numerical simulation of fractional-order systems," SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, vol. 47, pp. 321–338, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fractional-order control shows promise in many controlled environments that suffer from the classical problems of overshoot and resonance, as well as time diffuse applications such as [[thermal dissipation]] and chemical mixing. Fractional-order control has also been demonstrated to be capable of suppressing chaotic behaviors in mathematical models of, for example, muscular blood vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aghababa|first1=Mohammad Pourmahmood|last2=Borjkhani|first2=Mehdi|title=Chaotic fractional-order model for muscular blood vessel and its control via fractional control scheme|journal=Complexity|volume=20|issue=2|pages=37–46|doi=10.1002/cplx.21502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7785">'''Frit compression''' is the technique used to fabricate [[buckypaper]] and buckydiscs from a suspension of [[carbon nanotubes]] in a solvent. This is a quick, efficient method over surfactant-casting or acid oxidation filtration of carbon nanotubes.

==Background==
Traditional methods of buckypaper production involves the use of surfactants to disperse [[carbon nanotubes]] into aqueous solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s003390050734|title=Large-scale purification of single-wall carbon nanotubes: process, product, and characterization|year=1998|author=Rinzler, A.G.|journal=Applied Physics A: Materials Science &amp; Processing|volume=67|pages=29–37|last2=Liu|first2=J.|last3=Dai|first3=H.|last4=Nikolaev|first4=P.|last5=Huffman|first5=C.B.|last6=Rodr&amp;#x000ed;guez-Mac&amp;#x000ed;as|first6=F.J.|last7=Boul|first7=P.J.|last8=Lu|first8=A.H.|last9=Heymann|first9=D.|last10=Colbert|first10=D.T.|last11=Lee|first11=R.S.|last12=Fischer|first12=J.E.|last13=Rao|first13=A.M.|last14=Eklund|first14=P.C.|last15=Smalley|first15=R.E.|bibcode = 1998ApPhA..67...29R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0008-6223(02)00441-4|title=Development of a dispersion process for carbon nanotubes in ceramic matrix by heterocoagulation|year=2003|author=Sun, J|journal=Carbon|volume=41|pages=1063–1068|issue=5|last2=Gao|first2=Lian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that filtering this suspension allowed the nanotubes to pack together in a paper-like mat, thus coining the term “buckypaper” (bucky being the reference to the [[buckminsterfullerene]] molecule). The problem was the difficulty in removing the surfactant afterwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jp002555m|title=Organic Solvent Dispersions of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes: Toward Solutions of Pristine Nanotubes|year=2000|author=Ausman, Kevin D|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|volume=104|pages=8911–8915|last2=Piner|first2=Richard|last3=Lourie|first3=Oleg|last4=Ruoff|first4=Rodney S.|last5=Korobov|first5=Mikhail|issue=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the surfactant has been linked with cell lysis and tissue inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=97265|year=1978|author1=Cornett, Jb |author2=Shockman, Gd |title=Cellular lysis of Streptococcus faecalis induced with triton X-100|volume=135|issue=1|pages=153–60|pmc=224794|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
[[Image:frit-compression.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A frit compression system for casting buckypaper]]

An alternative casting method was developed in 2008 to produce buckypaper that did not require the use of surfactants or the acid oxidation of carbon nanotubes in order to obtain high-purity buckypaper for biomedical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2008.02.028|title=Geometric control and tuneable pore size distribution of buckypaper and buckydiscs|year=2008|author1=Whitby, RLD |author2=Fukuda, T |author3=Maekawa, T |author4=James, SL |author5=Mikhalovsky, SV |journal=Carbon|volume=46|pages=949–956|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frit-compression system was adapted from a [[Solid phase extraction]] (SPE) column, where a suspension of carbon nanotubes is squeezed between two polypropylene frits (70 micrometre pore diameter) inside a syringe column. The pore structure of the frit allows a rapid exit of the solvent leaving the carbon nanotubes to be pressed together. The presence of the solvent controls the interaction between the tubes allowing the formation of tube-tube junctions; its surface tension directly affects the overlap of adjoining nanotubes thus gaining control over the porosity and pore diameter distribution of buckypaper. The distribution of carbon nanotubes in solvent does not have to be a stable suspension, rather a general dispersion serves much easier to keep the nanotubes between the frits rather than pass through them.

Once the system is compressed, the frit-carbon nanotube sandwich is removed from the syringe housing and allowed to dry. The frits can then be removed to leave intact buckypaper. This methodology rapidly speeds up the casting process, avoids use of surfactants and acid oxidation, and the solvent can be fully recovered.

==Variety==

Image:buckyprism.jpg|Buckyprism with casting frit
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The cross-sectional geometry of the syringe housing will determine the final structure of the buckypaper and the amount of carbon nanotubes added to the column will affect the height of the carbon nanotube mat. Although there is currently no formal classification for paper, discs and columns, it was deemed necessary to differentiate between the different structures obtained for research purposes.

===Buckypaper===
Typically, cylindrical columns are used with a few milligrams of carbon nanotubes in a solvent. This generates buckypaper with a circular cross-section and film heights of a few hundred micrometres. Buckypaper is usually a class of carbon nanotube mats with depths from 1 to 500 micrometres.

===Buckydiscs===
Buckypaper with a height that is larger than 500 micrometres (0.5&amp;nbsp;mm) is called a buckydisc, being thicker than buckypaper and not paper-like. Moreover, when casting in water, the edges of the film can lift due to surface tension effects of the remaining solvent in the system that can pull carbon nanotubes closer together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nmat1782|year=2006|author=Futaba, Dn; Hata, K; Yamada, T; Hiraoka, T; Hayamizu, Y; Kakudate, Y; Tanaike, O; Hatori, H; Yumura, M; Iijima, S|title=Shape-engineerable and highly densely packed single-walled carbon nanotubes and their application as super-capacitor electrodes|volume=5|issue=12|pages=987–94|pmid=17128258|journal=Nature Materials|bibcode=2006NatMa...5..987F|last2=Hata|last3=Yamada|last4=Hiraoka|last5=Hayamizu|last6=Kakudate|last7=Tanaike|last8=Hatori|last9=Yumura|last10=Iijima}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buckycolumns===
Buckydiscs with heights larger than 1&amp;nbsp;mm can be referred to as buckycolumns. These carbon nanotube monoliths often exhibit hyperboloid geometries and are highly compressible &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2009.08.042|year=2010|author1=Whitby, RLD |author2=Mikhalovsky, SV |author3=Gun'ko VM |title=Mechanical performance of highly compressible multi-walled carbon nanotube columns with hyperboloid geometries|volume=48|issue=1|pages=145–152|journal=Carbon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buckyprism===
It is possible to use square housing to generate square cross sections, known as buckyprisms.

The '''Future Tactical Truck System''' ('''FTTS''') was a [[United States Armed Forces]] program for which the Operational Requirements Document was drawn up during 2003. FTTS was a proposed two vehicle modular family that was to replace the [[Humvee|AM General High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV (the Humvee))]], [[Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles]] (FMTV), [[Oshkosh Corporation|Oshkosh]] [[Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck|M977 Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT)]], [[Oshkosh Corporation|Oshkosh Palletized Load System (PLS)]] (in certain echelons), and all remaining [[M35 2½-ton cargo truck|M35]], [[M54 (truck)|M809]] and [[M939 Truck|M939 series]] of 2.5 and 5 ton trucks. The FTTS-UV (Utility Vehicle) was to replace the [[Humvee|HMMWV]], while the FTTS-MSV (Manoeuvre Sustainment Vehicle) was to replace all other types.&lt;ref name="Beyonf Leaf Springs"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Armada |url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Beyond+leaf+springs%3A+it+doesn't+matter+if+they're+used+in+the+most...-a0108792058|title= Beyond Leaf Springs |author= Ian C Young |accessdate= March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2006 work on FTTS was faltering and according to the Foreword of [[Jane's Information Group|Jane's Military Vehicles and Logistics 2006-2007]] by Shaun C Connors and Christopher F Foss ({{ISBN|978-0710627612}}): "The [[United States|U.S.]] Army’s original intention was that the FTTS (the logistic support for the [[Future Combat System]] (FCS)) with just two variants would eventually replace virtually all of the current tactical wheeled vehicle fleet. In a more realistic approach, the current FTTS-MSV/UV Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) efforts (with input from other efforts) will now be used ‘to define requirements’ for future [[United States|U.S.]] Army trucks."

The [[Association of the United States Army]] (July 2006) "Army Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Strategy: Meeting Current and Future Needs" [[pdf]] stated that the ACTD for FTTS was taking a two phase approach; the first phase involved modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) efforts in which multiple vendors presented concepts for technologies to be incorporated into designs for the UV and MSV variants of FTTS. The second phase included awards to three of the M&amp;S contractors to manufacture prototype designs: two contractors to produce their UV version with trailer, and one contractor to produce two MSVs with companion trailers. All vehicles and trailers were to be evaluated in a Military Utility Assessment (MUA) at [[Fort Lewis]], Washington. The MUA was scheduled to occur during the first and second quarters of FY07, with the results to fed into the requirements development process, this to define future truck requirements.

Elements of FTTS-UV ACTD were fed in to the ongoing [[Joint Light Tactical Vehicle]] (JLTV) program, this the replacement for part of the [[Humvee|HMMWV]] fleet. On 24 April 2006, establishment of a Joint Program Office to manage the [[JLTV]] effort was endorsed. The [[Association of the United States Army|AUSA]] [[pdf]] file previously referenced stated that: "Following approval, [of the [[JLTV]] Initial Capabilities Document by the Secretary of Defense],the Future Tactical Truck Systems Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration, the PSD [Platform Systems Demonstration], EMIP [Expedited Modernization Initiative Procedure] and various [[Office of Naval Research]] Science and Technology activities will inform the requirements process, thus ensuring requirements are realistic, achievable and relevant to all services.

Deliveries of the medium and heavy category trucks in production when FTTS commenced, and to be replaced by FTTS, continue. The [[Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles|FMTV]] (now with [[Oshkosh Corporation|Oshkosh]]) production contract has recently been extended to September 2016, and award of the Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles IV (FHTV) contract, on a sole source basis to [[Oshkosh Corporation|Oshkosh]], is anticipated in the near future. FHTV contract awards include [[Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck|HEMTT]] and [[Palletized Load System|PLS]].&lt;ref name=Foreword&gt;{{cite web |publisher= IHS Jane's|url= https://janes.ihs.com/CustomPages/Janes/DisplayPage.aspx?DocType=Reference&amp;ItemId=+++1508278&amp;Pubabbrev=JLSU |title= Jane's Logistics, Support &amp; Unmanned |author= Shaun C Connors &amp; Christopher F Foss |accessdate= March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
To evaluate possible future truck systems and designs, the U.S. Army's [[Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center|Tank-automotive and Armaments Command]] refereed the Future Tactical Truck Systems - Advanced Concepts and Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program. [[Navistar International]] and [[Lockheed Martin]]'s proposals, the [[International FTTS]] and Lockheed FTTS Utility Vehicles were selected, as well as the [[Armor Holdings]] proposal for the MSV.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;http://www.ausa.org/pdfdocs/TBIP-TWV06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006 they were tested at the [[Aberdeen Proving Grounds]]. Following this evaluation they were parked in [[The Pentagon]] courtyard for evaluation by higher-ranking military officials."

[[International Truck]]'s proposal for FTTS utilized a [[Hybrid Vehicle Drivetrains#Parallel hybrid|Parallel Hybrid]] Drivetrain and modular armor. It has undergone testing by 5th Brigade, [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] and [[14th Engineer Battalion]] at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]s and [[Fort Lewis]], along with [[Lockheed Martin]]'s design and [[Armor Holdings]]' Maneuver Sustainment Vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense-update.com/newscast/0407/news/020407_ftts.htm US Army Evaluates Military Uses of FTTS Concept Vehicles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/03/23/2385-military-concept-vehicles-to-aid-future-development/ Military concept vehicles to aid future development]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2210">A '''gas cracker''' is any device that splits the [[molecule]]s in a [[gas]] or [[liquid]], usually by [[electrolysis]], into [[atom]]s. The end product is usually a gas. A [[Hydrogen production|hydrocracker]] is an example of a gas cracker. In nature, molecules are split often, such as in food digestion and microbial [[digestion]] activity. A gas cracker device splits the molecule at a rate much greater than that normally found in nature. In science and industry, gas crackers are used to separate two or more elements in a molecule. For example, liquid [[water]], or {{chem|H|2|O}}, is separated into hydrogen and oxygen gases. This is not to be confused with the splitting of the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (nuclear power).

==Gas cracker==
Petrochemicals are usually manufactured in large scale from petroleum feed stocks using [[fluid catalytic cracking]]. Naphtha, natural gas, refinery off-gas and gas from cokers and thermal crackers are good sources. Thus natural gas is one of the most wanted feed stocks for petrochemicals production. The thermal craking of natural gas proceeds at very high temperature resulting in  olefins (Mostly ethylene/propylene). The temperature in a [[Gas burner|gas cracker]] exceeds 1000°C. For ultimate decomposition of gas into elements more than 1500 °C is required. Thus, [[acetylene]]/[[carbon black]] production encounters such high temperatures. Usually [[Oxy-fuel combustion process|oxy-combustion methods]] are used for attaining such high temperatures. [[BASF|BASF burners]]/Kellog burners are available in the market. 

==Other methods==
Further [[Cracking (chemistry)|electro cracking]] or [[Kværner process|plasma cracking]] methods are also available.

==Peterborough Green Wheel==
The Peterborough Millennium '''Green Wheel''' is an {{convert|80|km|mi}} network of [[cycleway]]s, [[footpath]]s and [[bridleway]]s. Designed as part of a sustainable transport system for the city, it was created as part of a Millennium project around [[Peterborough]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pect.org.uk/green-wheel Peterborough Environment City Trust - Green Wheel]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Green Wheel'' alludes to the circular nature of the major part of the path, which encircles Peterborough, with cycle route "spokes" leading from this perimeter, which passes through several peripheral settlements around Peterborough, into the city centre, allowing easy transport around the network, much of which required no new construction, instead using or improving already existing cycle routes or roads. The only major new construction for the project was that of a curved cycle bridge over the [[River Nene]] near [[Whittlesey]], from where the path can be accessed northwards towards [[Flag Fen]], into the city centre or southwards towards [[Orton, Peterborough|the Ortons]]. The network is fully signposted. As well as this, three circular pipe tunnels were constructed near [[Etton, Cambridgeshire|Etton]] village in order to allow the Green Wheel route to pass underneath the [[A15 road (Great Britain)|A15]].

The project also encourages recreational use and has created a sculpture trail, which provides functional, landscape artworks along the Green Wheel route and a ‘Living Landmarks’ project involving the local community in the creation of local landscape features such as mini woodlands, ponds and hedgerows.

The project cost £11 million and was 50% funded by the National Lottery through the [[Millennium Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-site/awards.cgi?action=detail&amp;id=127&amp;t=2 Millennium Project information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819040304/http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-site/awards.cgi?action=detail&amp;id=127&amp;t=2 |date=19 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also been the winner of many awards including a [[RIBA]] award for Architecture in 2003.

==Bedford Green Wheel==
The Bedford Green Wheel is also a project to build on the existing network of traffic free paths and quiet routes for cyclists and walkers. This network will run around [[Bedford]], [[England]], and includes 'spokes' linking into the town centre. The network will link parks, nature reserves, countryside and homes. This project is part of Bedford Borough Council's Green Infrastructure Plan 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portal.bedford.gov.uk/internet/environment/planning/website%20documents/allocations%20and%20designations/a&amp;d%20plan%20for%20submission%20sept%202011/a&amp;d%20plan%20for%20submission%20background%20papers%20sept%202011/chapter%207%20green%20infrastructure/Bedford%20Green%20Infrastructure%20Plan%202009.pdf Bedford Borough Council's Green Infrastructure Plan 2009]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cycling Campaign for North Bedfordshire]] promotes and encourages the use of the Bedford Green Wheel.

[[File:Busybox DG834Gt.PNG|thumb|The [[BusyBox]] &lt;tt&gt;HELP&lt;/tt&gt; command]]
In [[computing]], '''&lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt;''' is a [[command (computing)|command]] in various [[command line interface|command line]] [[Shell (computing)|shells]] such as &lt;code&gt;[[COMMAND.COM]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[cmd.exe]]&lt;/code&gt;, [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]], [[4DOS]]/[[4NT (shell)|4NT]], [[Windows PowerShell]], [[Singularity (operating system)|Singularity shell]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[GNU Octave]]. It provides [[Online help|online information]] about available commands and the shell environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490917.aspx Microsoft TechNet Help article]&lt;/ref&gt;

The command is available in [[operating system]]s such as [[DOS]], [[OS/2]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[ReactOS]], [[Stratus VOS|OpenVOS]]&lt;ref&gt;http://stratadoc.stratus.com/vos/19.1.0/r098-19/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/r098-19.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, [[HP Multi-Programming Executive|MPE/iX]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teamnaconsulting.com/compresources/pdfs/c01687363.pdf MPE/iX Command Reference Manual]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[KolibriOS]]&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.kolibrios.org/wiki/Shell&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[RT-11]]&lt;ref&gt;http://paleoferrosaurus.com/beta/documents/rt11help.html#HELP&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TOPS-20]]&lt;ref name=CMDref&gt;{{cite web

|title=OS/8 Handbook |date=April 1974 |access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Unix]], the command is part of the [[Source Code Control System]] and prints help information for the SCCS commands.

==Syntax==
 help [command]

Arguments:
*'''&lt;code&gt;command&lt;/code&gt;''' This [[command-line argument]] specifies the name of the command about which information is to be displayed.

==Implementations==
    
===DOS=== 
The '''help''' command is available in [[MS-DOS]] 5.x and later versions of the software.
If no arguments are provided, the command lists the contents of &lt;code&gt;DOSHELP.HLP&lt;/code&gt;. In MS-DOS 6.x this command exists as FASTHELP. In [[DR-DOS]], HELP is a [[batch file]] that launches DR-DOS' internal help program, DOSBOOK.

The MS-DOS 6.xx help command uses [[QBasic]] to view a quickhelp &lt;code&gt;HELP.HLP&lt;/code&gt; file, which contains more extensive information on the commands, with some hyperlinking etc. The MS-DOS 6.22 help system is included on [[Windows 9x]] CD-ROM versions as well.

[[PC DOS]] 7.xx help uses &lt;code&gt;view.exe&lt;/code&gt; to open OS/2 style [[INF file]]s (&lt;code&gt;cmdref.inf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dosrexx.inf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;doserror.inf&lt;/code&gt;), opening these to the appropriate pages.

The [[FreeDOS]] version was developed by Joe Cosentino.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/1.2/repos/pkg-html/help.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===4DOS/4NT===
The 4DOS/4NT '''help''' command uses a [[text user interface]] to display the online help.

===cmd.exe===
Used without parameters, '''help''' lists and briefly describes every system command.
[[Windows NT]]-based versions use MS-DOS 5 style help. Versions before [[Windows Vista]] also have a Windows help file (&lt;code&gt;NTCMDS.HLP&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;NTCMDS.INF&lt;/code&gt;) in a similar style to MS-DOS 6.

===Windows PowerShell===
In [[Windows PowerShell]], '''help''' is a short form (implemented as a PowerShell function) for access to the &lt;code&gt;Get-Help&lt;/code&gt; Cmdlet.

Windows PowerShell includes an extensive, console-based help system, reminiscent of man pages in Unix. The help topics include help for cmdlets, providers, and concepts in PowerShell.

===GNU Bash===
In [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]], the builtin command '''help'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html|title=Bash Reference Manual|website=www.gnu.org|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists all Bash builtin commands if used without arguments. Otherwise, it prints a brief summary of a command. Its syntax is:
 help [-dms] [pattern]

==Examples==

===DOSBox=== 
&lt;source lang="doscon"&gt;
Z:\&gt;help
If you want a list of all supported commands type help /all .
A short list of the most often used commands:
&lt;DIR     &gt; Directory View.
&lt;CD      &gt; Display/changes the current directory.
&lt;CLS     &gt; Clear screen.
&lt;COPY    &gt; Copy files.
...
&lt;/source&gt;

===Python===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35648">The '''history of calendars''', means that people creating and using methods for keeping track of days and larger divisions of time, covers a practice with ancient roots.

Archeologists have reconstructed methods of [[timekeeping]] that go back to prehistoric times at least as old as the [[Neolithic]]. The natural units for timekeeping used by most historical societies are the [[day]], the [[solar year]] and the [[lunation]].
[[Calendar]]s are explicit schemes used for timekeeping. The first historically attested and formulized calendars date to the [[Bronze Age]], dependent on the development of [[Bronze Age writing|writing]] in the [[Ancient Near East]]. The [[Sumerian calendar]] was the earliest, followed by the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian]], [[Assyrian calendar|Assyrian]] and [[Elamite]] calendars.

A larger number of calendar systems of the ancient Near East appear in the [[Iron Age]] archaeological record, based on the Assyrian and [[Babylonian calendar]]s. This includes the calendar of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], which in turn gave rise to the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] as well as the [[Hebrew calendar]].

Calendars in antiquity were usually [[lunisolar]], depending on the introduction of [[intercalary month]]s to align the solar and the lunar years. This was mostly based on observation, but there may have been early attempts to model the pattern of intercalation algorithmically, as evidenced in the fragmentary 2nd-century [[Coligny calendar]]. Nevertheless, the Roman calendar contained very ancient remnants of a pre-Etruscan 10-month solar year.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion in the Etruscan period" in [http://global.britannica.com/topic/Roman-religion Roman religion] in Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman calendar was reformed by [[Julius Caesar]] in 45 BCE. The [[Julian calendar]] was no longer dependent on the observation of the new moon but simply followed an algorithm of introducing a leap day every four years.
This created a dissociation of the calendar [[month]] from the [[lunation]].

In the 11th century in [[Iran|Persia]], a calendar reform led by [[Omar Khayyam|Khayyam]] was announced in 1079, when the length of the year was measured as 365.24219858156 days.&lt;ref name="Khayyam biography"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Khayyam.html|title=Khayyam biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the length of the year is changing in the sixth decimal place over a person's lifetime, this is outstandingly accurate. For comparison the length of the year at the end of the 19th century was 365.242196 days, while today it is 365.242190 days.&lt;ref name="Khayyam biography"/&gt;

The [[Gregorian calendar]] was introduced as a refinement of the Julian calendar in 1582, and is today in worldwide use as the ''de facto'' calendar for secular purposes.

==Etymology==
The term ''calendar'' itself is taken from the ''[[calends]]'', the term for the first day of the month in the [[Roman calendar]], related to the verb ''calare'' "to call out", referring to the calling or the announcement that the new moon was just seen. Latin ''calendarium'' meant "account book, register", as accounts were settled and debts were collected on the calends of each month.

The Latin term was adopted in [[Old French]] as ''calendier'' and from there in [[Middle English]] as ''calender'' by the 13th century. The spelling ''calendar'' is from [[Early Modern English]].

An alternative hypothesis connects "calendar" with [[Koledari]] in Slavic, pre-Christian tradition, which was later incorporated into Christmas. ''Kolo'' means "circle, cycle" and ''dar'' means "a gift".
[[File:Equinozio da Pizzo Vento,tramonto fondachelli fantina, sicilia.JPG|thumb|equinox seen from the astronomic calendar of Pizzo Vento at [[Fondachelli-Fantina|Fondachelli Fantina]], [[Sicily]]]]

==Prehistory==
A number of prehistoric structures have been proposed as having had the purpose of timekeeping (typically keeping track of the course of the [[solar year]]).
This includes many [[megalithic]] structures, and reconstructed arrangements going back far into the [[Neolithic]] period.

A ceramic artefact from Bulgaria, known as the [[Slatino furnace model]], has been pronounced by local archeologists and media to be the oldest known calendar representation, a claim not endorsed in mainstream views.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey D., 2000, Balkan Prehistory: Exclusion, Incorporation and Identity, London:Routledge p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[mesolithic]] arrangement of twelve pits and an arc found in [[Warren Field]], [[Aberdeenshire]], Scotland, dated to roughly 10,000 years ago, has been described as a [[lunar calendar]] and was dubbed the "world's oldest known calendar" in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2013-07-scotland-lunar-calendar-stone-age-rethink.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809125949/http://phys.org/news/2013-07-scotland-lunar-calendar-stone-age-rethink.html|date=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vučedol culture#Oldest European calendar|Oldest European calendar]] is found near to [[Vukovar]] in modern-day Croatia. It is a ceramic vessel bearing inscribed ideograms of celestial objects.

==Ancient Near East==

The ancient [[Sumer]]ian calendar divided a year into 12 [[lunar month]]s of 29 or 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/mesopotamiancalander.htm|title=Mesopotamia, Calendar|publisher=International World History Project|website=History-world.org|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each month began with the sighting of a new moon.

In addition to these holy days, there were also feast days which varied from city to city.

==Antiquity==

===Babylonia and Persia===
{{further|Babylonian calendar|Zoroastrian calendar}}

Although the earliest evidence of Iranian calendrical traditions is from the [[second millennium BCE]], predating the appearance of the Iranian prophet [[Zoroaster]], the first fully preserved calendar is that of the [[Achaemenid]]s.  Throughout recorded history, [[Persian people|Persians]] have been keen on the idea and importance of having a [[calendar]]. They were among the first cultures to use a [[solar calendar]] and have long favoured a solar over [[lunar calendar|lunar]] and [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] approaches. The sun has always been a symbol in [[Iranian culture]] and is closely related to the folklore regarding [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref name=EI-C-i&gt;{{harv|Panaino|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Old Persian calendar ====
Old Persian inscriptions and tablets indicate that early Iranians used a [[360-day calendar]] based on the solar observation directly and modified for their beliefs. Days were not named. The months had two or three divisions depending on the phase of the moon. Twelve months of 30 days were named for festivals or activities of the [[pastoral]] year. A 13th month was added every six years to keep the calendar synchronized with the seasons.

==== Zoroastrian calendar ====
{{main|Zoroastrian calendar}}
The first calendars based on [[Zoroastrian calendar|Zoroastrian]] cosmology appeared in the later Achaemenid period (650 to 330 BCE). They evolved over the centuries, but month names changed little until now.

The unified [[Achaemenid Empire]] required a distinctive Iranian calendar, and one was devised in [[Egypt]]ian tradition, with 12 months of 30 days, each dedicated to a [[yazata]] (Eyzad), and four divisions resembling the Semitic week. Four days per month were dedicated to [[Ahura Mazda]] and seven were named after the six [[Amesha Spentas]]. Thirteen days were named after Fire, Water, Sun, Moon, [[Tiri, Estonia|Tiri]] and Geush Urvan (the soul of all animals), Mithra, [[Sraosha]] (Soroush, yazata of prayer), [[Rashnu]] (the Judge), [[Fravashi]], [[Verethragna|Bahram]] (yazata of victory), Raman (Ramesh meaning peace), and [[Vayu-Vata|Vata]], the divinity of the wind. Three were dedicated to the female divinities, [[Daena]] (yazata of religion and personified conscious), [[Ashi]] (yazata of fortune) and [[Arshtat]] (justice). The remaining four were dedicated to [[Asman]] (lord of sky or Heaven), [[Zam]] (earth), Manthra Spenta (the Bounteous Sacred Word) and Anaghra Raocha (the 'Endless Light' of paradise).

==== Modifications by Parthians, Ardashir I, Hormizd I, Yazdgerd III ====
The [[Parthia]]ns (Arsacid dynasty) adopted the same calendar system with minor modifications, and dated their era from 248 BCE, the date they succeeded the Seleucids. Their names for the months and days are Parthian equivalents of the Avestan ones used previously, differing slightly from the [[Middle Persian]] names used by the [[Sassanians]]. For example, in Achaemenid times the modern Persian month 'Day' was called Dadvah (Creator), in Parthian it was Datush and the Sassanians named it Dadv/Dai (Dadar in Pahlavi).

When in April of AD 224 the Parthian dynasty fell and was replaced by the Sasanid, the new king, [[Ardashir I]], abolished the official Babylonian calendar and replaced it with the Zoroastrian.   This involved a correction to the places of the ''gahanbar'', which had slipped back in the seasons since they were fixed.   These were placed eight months later, as were the ''epagemonai'', the 'Gatha' or 'Gah' days after the ancient Zoroastrian hymns of the same name.   Other countries, such as the Armenians and Choresmians, did not accept the change.

==== The formation of the current Persian calendar in the 11th century ====

[[Toghril Beg]], the founder of the [[Seljuq dynasty]], had made Esfahan the capital of his domains and his grandson [[Malik-Shah I|Malik-Shah]] was the ruler of that city from 1073. An invitation was sent to [[Khayyam]] from Malik-Shah and from his vizier [[Nizam al-Mulk]] asking Khayyam to go to Esfahan to set up an Observatory there. Other leading astronomers were also brought to the Observatory in Esfahan and for 18 years Khayyam led the scientists and produced work of outstanding quality. During this time Khayyam led work on compiling astronomical tables and he also contributed to calendar reform in 1079.

Cowell quotes [[The Calcutta Review]] No 59:-
''When the Malik Shah determined to reform the calendar, [[Omar Khayyam|Omar]] was one of the eight learned men employed to do it, the result was the Jalali era (so called from Jalal-ud-din, one of the king's names) - 'a computation of time,' says Gibbon, 'which surpasses the Julian, and approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian style.'''

Khayyam measured the length of the year as 365.24219858156 days. Two comments on this result. Firstly it shows an incredible confidence to attempt to give the result to this degree of accuracy. We know now that the length of the year is changing in the sixth decimal place over a person's lifetime. Secondly it is outstandingly accurate. For comparison the length of the year at the end of the 19th century was 365.242196 days, while today it is 365.242190 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Khayyam.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Greece===
The Greeks, as early as the time of [[Homer]], appear to have been familiar with the division of the year into the twelve lunar months but no intercalary month ''Embolimos'' or day is then mentioned. Independent of the division of a month into days, it was divided into periods according to the increase and decrease of the moon. 
Thus, the first day or new moon was called ''Noumenia''. The month in which the year began, as well as the names of the months, differed among the states, and in some parts even no names existed for the months, as they were distinguished only numerically, as the first, second, third, fourth month, etc.

The [[Attic calendar|ancient Athenian calendar]] was a [[lunisolar]] calendar with 354-day years, consisting of twelve months of alternating length of 29 or 30 days. To keep the calendar in line with the solar year of 365.242 days, an extra, intercalary month was added in every other year.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The Athenian months were called Hekatombion, Metageitnion, Boedromion, Pyanepsion, Maimakterion, Poseidon, Gamelion, Anthesterion, Elaphebolion, Munychion, Thargelion, and Skirophorion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ginzel: Handbuch der Mathematischen und Technischen Chronologie |year=1911 |volume=2 |publisher=F.K. |location=Germany |pages= 335–336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intercalary month usually came after Poseidon, and was called second Poseidon.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In addition to their regular, "festival" calendar, the Athenians maintained a second, political calendar . This "conciliar" calendar divided the year into "[[prytanies]]", one for each of the "[[phylai]]", the subdivisions of Athenian citizens. The number of phylai, and hence the number of prytanies, varied over time. Until 307 BC, there were 10 phylai. After that the number varies between 11 and 13 (usually 12). Even more confusing, while the conciliar and festival years were about the same length in the 4th century BC, such was not regularly the case earlier or later. Documents dated by prytany are frequently very difficult to assign to a particular equivalent in the [[Julian calendar]].

The table of Greek Olympiads, following the four-year cycles between the [[Olympic Games]] from 1 July 776 BC, continued until the end of the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name="Davies267"&gt;Davies, p 267&lt;/ref&gt; The Babylonian Era of Nabonassar, beginning on 26 February 747 BC, was used by the Greeks of [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; It was later known in the Middle Ages from the works of [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

===Hellenistic period===
{{further|Roman calendar}}

The Greek calendars were greatly diversified by the [[Hellenistic period]], with separate traditions in every Greek state.
Of primary importance for the reconstruction of the regional Greek calendars is the calendar of [[Delphi]], because of the numerous documents found there recording the manumission of slaves, many of which are dated both in the Delphian and in a regional calendar.

The Macedonian Era of the Seleucids, which began with the conquest of [[Babylon]] by [[Seleucus Nicator]] in 312 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; It became widely used in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; The [[Jews]] knew it as the "era of contracts", and used it in Europe until the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

The Roman Republican calendar numbered years based on the [[List of Roman consuls|sitting consuls]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; References to the year of consulship were used in both conversation and official records.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; Romans from the same family often had the same ''praenomen'', which sometimes makes it difficult to distinguish them, and there were two consuls at any one time, each of whom might sometimes hold the appointment more than once, meaning that it was (and is) necessary to be well educated in history to understand the references.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;  The Romans had an [[Nundinae|eight-day week]], with the market-day falling every eight days. It was called a ''nundinum'' or 'nine-day' in [[inclusive counting]].

Most of the regional [[Hindu calendar]]s are inherited  from a system standardized in classical [[Hindu astronomy]] 
as adopted via [[Indo-Greek]] transmission in the final centuries BCE, and  reformed by [[Gupta period|Gupta era]] astronomers such as [[Āryabhaṭa]] and [[Varahamihira|Varāhamihira]].

===China===
{{main|Chinese calendar}}
Before the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (before 770 BC), the Chinese Calendars were solar calendars.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} In the so-called  [[Wu Xing|five-phase]] calendar, the year consists of 10 months and a transition, each month being 36 days long, and the transitions 5 or 6 days. 
During the [[Warring States period]] (~475-220 BC), the primitive lunisolar calendars were established under the Zhou Dynasty, known as the six ancient calendars ({{zh|t=古六曆|s=古六历}}). The months of these calendars begin on the day with the new moon, with 12 or 13 months (lunations) in a year. The intercalary month is placed at the end of the year. In [[Qin China]], the Qin calendar ({{zh|t=秦曆|s=秦历}}) was introduced. It follows the rules of Zhuanxu's calendar, but the months order follows the Xia's calendar.

===Ancient India ===
{{main|Hindu calendar}} 
Time keeping was important to Vedic rituals, and ''Jyotisha'' was the Vedic era field of tracking and predicting the movements of astronomical bodies in order to keep time, in order to fix the day and time of these rituals.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnijyotisa/&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca326/&gt;&lt;ref name="mullerhaslp210"&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Max Müller|title=A History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHCe48QSZaUC|year=1860|publisher=Williams and Norgate|pages=210–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was one of the six ancient [[Vedanga]]s, or ancillary science connected with the [[Vedas]] – the scriptures of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnijyotisa&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit–English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA353|year=1923|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca326&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Jyotisha" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pages 326–327&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu calendar, sometimes referred to as ''Panchanga'', is a collective term for the various [[lunisolar calendar]]s traditionally used in [[Hinduism]]. They adopt a similar underlying concept for timekeeping, but differ in their relative emphasis to moon cycle or the sun cycle, the names of months and when they consider the New Year to start.&lt;ref name=richmond80&gt;{{Cite book|title=Time Measurement and Calendar Construction|publisher= Brill Archive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwEVAAAAIAAJ| accessdate=2011-09-18| year= 1956|author= B.

The Hindu calendars have been in use in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times, and remains in use by the [[Hindu]]s in India and Nepal particularly to set the Hindu festival dates. Early Buddhist and Jain communities of India adopted the ancient Hindu calendar, later Vikrami calendar and then local [[Buddhist calendar]]s.

===Roman Empire===
{{main|Julian calendar}}
The old Roman year had 304 days divided into 10 months, beginning with [[Martius (month)|March]]. However the ancient historian Livy gave credit to the second early Roman king [[Numa Pompilius]] for devising a calendar of 12 months. The extra months ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' had been invented, supposedly by Numa Pompilius, as stop-gaps.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; Julius Caesar realized that the system had become inoperable, so he effected drastic changes in the year of his third consulship.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; The [[New Year]] in 709 AUC &lt;!--Book typo as 707 AUC--&gt; began on 1 January and ran over 365 days until 31 December.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; Further adjustments were made under Augustus, who introduced the concept of the "leap year" in 757 AUC (AD 4){{Fix|text=conversion is 1 year out}}.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; The resultant [[Julian calendar]] remained in almost universal use in Europe until 1582,&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; and in some countries until as late as the twentieth century.

[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] introduced the ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' epoch, assuming a foundation of Rome in 753 BC. The system remained in use during the early Middle Ages until the widespread adoption of the [[Dionysian era]] in the [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian period]].

In the Roman Empire, the AUC year could be used alongside the consular year, so that the consulship of [[Quintus Fufius Calenus]] and [[Publius Vatinius]] could be determined as 707 AUC (or 47 BC), the third consulship of [[Julius Caesar|Caius Julius Caesar]], with [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], as 708 AUC (or 46 BC), and the fourth consulship of Gaius Julius Caesar as 709 AUC (or 45 BC).&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

The seven-day [[week]] has a tradition reaching back to the ancient Near East, but the introduction of the "planetary week" which remains in modern use dates to the Roman Empire period (see also [[names of the days of the week]]).

===Christian Europe===

{{main|Anno Domini}}
For the first six centuries since the birth of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], European countries used various local systems to count years, most usually [[regnal year]]s, modeled on the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; In some cases, [[Anno Mundi|Creation dating]] was also used. In the 6th century, the Christian monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] devised the ''[[Anno Domini]]'' system, dating from the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; In the 8th century, the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] historian [[Bede|Bede the Venerable]] used another [[Latin]] term, "''ante uero incarnationis dominicae tempus''" ("the time before the Lord's true incarnation", equivalent to the [[English language|English]] "before Christ"), to identify years before the first year of this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Historiam Ecclesiasticam Gentis Anglorum: Liber Primus |language=Latin | author=[[Bede]] |url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede1.shtml|publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |accessdate=2008-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], even Popes continued to date documents according to [[regnal years]], and usage of AD only gradually became common in Europe from the 11th to the 14th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to adopt the ''Anno Domini'' system.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In 1267, the medieval scientist [[Roger Bacon]] stated the times of full moons as a number of hours, minutes, seconds, thirds, and fourths (''horae'', ''minuta'', ''secunda'', ''tertia'', and ''quarta'') after noon on specified calendar dates.&lt;ref&gt;''The [[Opus Majus]] of Roger Bacon'', tr. Robert Belle Burke (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1928, reprinted 2000) table facing page 231, {{ISBN|978-1-85506-856-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a third for {{frac|1|60}} of a second remains in some languages, for example [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ثالثة, the modern second is further divided [[decimal]]ly.

Rival [[calendar era]]s to ''Anno Domini'' remained in use in Christian Europe.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; In Spain, the "Era of the Caesars" was dated from Octavian's conquest of Iberia in 39 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; It was adopted by the [[Visigoths]] and remained in use in [[Catalonia]] until 1180, [[Crown of Castile|Castille]] until 1382 and Portugal until 1415.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

For chronological purposes, the flaw of the Anno Domini system was that dates have to be reckoned backwards or forwards according as they are BC or AD. According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', "in an ideally perfect system all events would be reckoned in one sequence. The difficulty was to find a starting point whence to reckon, for the beginnings of history in which this should naturally be placed are those of which chronologically we know least."{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} For both Christians and [[Jews]], the prime historical date was the Year of Creation, or ''[[Annus Mundi]]''.&lt;ref name="Davies268"&gt;Davies, p 268&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] fixed the date of Creation at 5509 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies268"/&gt; This remained the basis of the ecclesiastical calendar in the [[Greek Orthodox|Greek]] and [[Russian Orthodox]] world until modern times.&lt;ref name="Davies268"/&gt; The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] fixed on 5500 BC. Later, the [[Church of England]], under [[Archbishop Ussher]] in 1650, would pick 4004 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies268"/&gt;

===Bulgar calendar===
The [[Bulgar calendar]] was a calendar system used by the [[Bulgars]], a seminomadic people, originally from Central Asia, who from the 2nd century onwards dwelled in the Eurasian steppes north of the Caucasus and around the banks of river Volga. In 681 part of the Bulgars settled in the Balkan peninsula and established Bulgaria. The main source of information used for reconstruction of the Bulgar calendar is a short 15th century transcript, which contains 10 pairs of calendar terms, the same dating system being found in a marginal note of a manuscript from the 10th c. According to the reconstructed calendar, the Bulgars used a 12-year cyclic calendar similar to the one adopted by Turkic peoples from the [[Chinese calendar]], with names and numbers that are deciphered as in Bulgar language.

===Islamic calendar===
The [[Islamic calendar]] is based on the prohibition of intercalation (''[[nasi']]'') by [[Muhammad]], in Islamic tradition dated to a sermon held on  9 [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] AH 10 (Julian date: 6 March 632). This resulted in an observationally based lunar calendar shifting relative to the seasons of the solar year.

===Icelandic calendar===
{{main|Icelandic calendar}}
In medieval Iceland, a calendar was introduced in the 10th century. While the ancient [[Germanic calendar]]s were based on lunar months, the new Icelandic calendar introduced  a purely solar reckoning, with a year having a fixed number of weeks (52 weeks or 364 days). This necessitated the introduction of "leap weeks" instead of the Julian leap days.

===Indo-Islamic calendars===
{{See also|Fasli calendar}} 
During the Mughal rule, land taxes were collected from Bengali people according to the Islamic Hijri calendar. This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] asked his royal astronomer [[Fathullah Shirazi]] to create a new calendar by combining the lunar [[Islamic Calendar|Islamic calendar]] and solar [[Hindu calendar]] already in use, and this was known as ''Fasholi shan'' (harvest calendar).&lt;ref name= Chakrabarti114&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kunal Chakrabarti|author2=Shubhra Chakrabarti|title=Historical Dictionary of the Bengalis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVOFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114 |year= 2013|publisher =Scarecrow|isbn= 978-0-8108-8024-5|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=banglapedia&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2015 |title=Pahela Baishakh |encyclopedia=Banglapedia |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |location=Dhaka, Bangladesh |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pahela_Baishakh}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Amartya Sen]], Akbar's official calendar "Tarikh-ilahi" with the zero year of 1556 CE was a blend of pre-existing Hindu and Islamic calendars.

{{main|Mayan calendar}}
Of all the ancient calendar systems, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and other [[Mesoamerican]] systems are the most complex. The [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n calendar had 2 years, the 260-day Sacred Round, or ''tzolkin'', and the 365-day Vague Year, or ''haab''.&lt;ref name="maya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilization.ca/civil/maya/mmc06eng.html |title=Maya civilization |accessdate=2008-04-03 |publisher=Civilization.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305074426/http://www.civilization.ca/civil/maya/mmc06eng.html |archivedate=5 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sacred Round of 260 days is composed of two smaller cycles: the numbers 1 through 13, coupled with 20 different day names: Imix, Ik, Akbal, Kan, Chicchan, Cimi, Manik, Lamat, Muluc, Oc, Chuen, Eb, Ben, Ix, Men, Cib, Caban, Eiznab, Cauac, and Ahau. The Sacred Round was used to determine important activities related to the gods and humans: name individuals, predict the future, decide on auspicious dates for battles, marriages, and so on.&lt;ref name="maya"/&gt;

The two cycles of 13 and 20 intermesh and are repeated without interruption: the cycle would begin with 1 Imix, then 2 Ik, then 3 Akbal and so on until the number 13 was reached, at which point the number cycle was restarted so 13 Ben would be followed by 1 Ix, 2 Men and so on. This time Imix would be numbered 8. The cycle ended after 260 days, with the last day being 13 Ahau.&lt;ref name="maya" /&gt;

The Vague Year of 365 days is similar to our [[Gregorian calendar|modern calendar]], consisting of 18 months of 20 days each, with an unlucky five-day period at the end. The Vague Year had to do primarily with the seasons and agriculture, and was based on the solar cycle. The 18 Maya months are known, in order, as: Pop, Uo, Zip, Zotz, Tzec, Xuc, Yaxkin, Mol, Chen, Yax, Zac, Ceh, Mac, Kankin, Maun, Pax, Kayab and Cumku. The unlucky five-day period was known as [[Uayeb]], and was considered a time which could hold danger, death and bad luck.&lt;ref name="maya" /&gt;

The Vague Year began with the month of Pop. The Maya 20-day month always begins with the seating of the month, followed by days numbered 1 to 19, then the seating of the following month, and so on. This ties in with the Maya notion that each month influences the next. The Maya new year would start with 1 Pop, followed by 2 Pop, all the way through to 19 Pop, followed by the seating of the month of Uo, written as 0 Uo, then 1 Uo, 2 Uo and so on. These two cycles coincided every 52 years. The 52-year period of time was called a "bundle" and was similar to a modern-day century.&lt;ref name="maya"/&gt;

==Modern calendars==
{{further|List of calendars|Calendar reform}}
While the [[Gregorian calendar]] is  now in worldwide use for secular purposes, various medieval or ancient calendars remain in regional use for religious or social purposes, including the [[Julian calendar]], the [[Hebrew calendar]], the [[Islamic calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s, the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] etc.

There are also various modern calendars that see limited use, either created for the use of [[new religious movement]]s or reformed versions of older religious calendars, or calendars introduced by regionalist or nationalist movements.

An '''integrated [[receiver (radio)|receiver]]/decoder''' ('''IRD''') is an electronic [[Integrated circuit|device]] used to pick up a radio-frequency [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] and convert [[Digital data|digital]] information transmitted in it.

==Consumer IRDs==
{{Main|Set-top box}}

Consumer IRDs, commonly called [[set-top box]]es, are used by end users and are much cheaper compared to professional IRDs. To curb content piracy, they also lack many features and [[Interface (computer science)|interface]]s found in professional IRDs such as outputting uncompressed [[Serial Digital Interface|SDI]] video or [[Asynchronous serial interface|ASI]] [[MPEG transport stream|transport stream]] dumps. They are also designed to be more aesthetically pleasing.

==Professional IRDs==
Commonly found in [[radio]], [[television]], [[Cable television|Cable]] and [[satellite]] broadcasting facilities, the IRD is generally used for the reception of contribution feeds that are intended for re-broadcasting. The IRD is the interface between a receiving [[satellite dish]] or [[Telecommunications company|Telco]] networks and a broadcasting facility video/audio infrastructure. 

Professional IRDs have various features that consumer IRDs lack such as:

* [[Serial Digital Interface|SDI]] outputs.
* [[Asynchronous serial interface|ASI]] inputs / outputs.
* [[Professional video over IP|TSoIP]] inputs.
* [[AES/EBU]] Audio decoding.
* [[Vertical blanking interval|VBI]] reinsertion.
* [[Widescreen signaling|WSS]] data and pass through.
* [[MPEG transport stream|Transport stream]] demultiplexing.
* [[Genlock]] input.
* [[Frame synchronization]] of digital video output to analogue input.
* [[Closed captioning|Closed captions]] and [[Video signal generator|VITS]]/[[Issue tracking system|ITS]]/[[Vertical interval timecode|VITC]] Insertion.
* Video [[Test card|test pattern]] generator.
* Remote management over [[Local area network|LAN]]/[[Wide area network|WAN]].
* [[General Purpose Input/Output|GPI]] interface - For sending external alarm triggers.
* [[19-inch rack|Rack]] mountable.

==Uses==
* [[direct broadcast satellite]] (DBS) [[television]] applications like [[DirecTV]], [[SES Astra|Astra]] or [[DishTV]]
* [[fixed service satellite]] (FSS) applications like [[VideoCipher]], [[DigiCipher]], or [[PowerVu]]
* [[digital audio radio satellite]] (DARS) applications like [[XM Satellite Radio]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]
* [[digital audio broadcasting]] (DAB) applications like [[Eureka 147]] and [[IBOC]]
* [[Digital Video Broadcasting|digital video broadcasting]] (DVB) applications like [[DVB-T]] and [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]]

The zone spans from the western part of [[Urayasu, Chiba|Urayasu]] in the northeast to [[Futtsu, Chiba|Futtsu]] in the southeast of the region. The zone has no political or administrative status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | title = Keiyō Industrial Zone | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/314276/Keiyō-Industrial-Zone | accessdate = 2012-12-19 | year = 2012 | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | location = Chicago, Ill.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The name of the industrial zone is formed from two [[kanji]] characters. The first, {{linktext|京}}, means "[[capital city]]" and refers to Tokyo. The second, {{linktext|葉}}, meaning "[[leaf]]", is the second kanji in "Chiba" and refers to Chiba Prefecture, and the compound refers to the Tokyo-Chiba region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Dijitaru daijisen |title=Keiyō |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2012-03-26 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

The Keiyō Industrial Zone spans the coast of Tokyo Bay from Urayasu in the northeast, through [[Funabashi, Chiba|Funabashi]], [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba City]], [[Kisarazu, Chiba|Kisarazu]], [[Kimitsu, Chiba|Kimitsu]], [[Ichihara, Chiba|Ichihara]], [[Sodegaura, Chiba|Sodegaura]], and ends in [[Futtsu, Chiba|Futtsu]] to the southeast. Numerous small rivers empty into the industrial region, and provide a source of water to support industry. They include the [[Edo River]], the [[Yōrō River]], and the [[Koito River]].

==History==
[[File:Nippon Steel Kimitsu Works.jpg|thumb|left|Nippon Steel Kimitsu Works]]
Before industrialization the Keiyō region was originally home to ''[[nori]]'' [[seaweed]] collection, the [[shellfish]] industry, mixed small-scale fishing and agricultural villages, and [[seaside resort|beach resorts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | title = Keiyō Industrial Zone | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/314276/Keiyō-Industrial-Zone | accessdate = 2012-12-19 | year = 2012 | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | location = Chicago, Ill.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Keihin region]], spanning west from Tokyo to [[Yokohama, Kanagawa|Yokohama]], was developed after [[World War I]]. With the rapid development of the [[defense industry]] in Japan from the beginning of the [[Shōwa period]] in 1926, a plan for the [[decentralization]] of industry from the immediate Tokyo area was planned in 1935.
The Keiyō Industrial Region was fully developed after [[World War II]]. Some [[land reclamation]] had been carried out in coastal areas of Tokyo Bay as part of the industrialization of Japan in the early 20th century. Reclaimed land areas replaced traditional fishing areas and supported small factories. The construction of the [[Kawasaki Steel Corporation|Kawasaki]] [[Kawasaki Steel Works|Steel Works]] in Chiba City in 1953 marked the beginning of the large-scale construction of [[heavy industry]] infrastructure in the industrial zone,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Chiba-ken Kikakubu Kenminka | title = Chiba-ken hyakunen no ayumi | publisher = Chiba-ken  | year = 1973  | pages = 38|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other industries soon followed. The [[deepwater port]]s of the Keiyō Industrial Zone were built starting in the 1950s. [[Thermal power]] [[Electric generator|generator]]s were built,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | title = Keiyō Industrial Zone | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/314276/Keiyō-Industrial-Zone | accessdate = 2012-12-19 | year = 2012 | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | location = Chicago, Ill.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and large tracts of land were reclaimed from the bay for expansion of the Keiyō region. Keiyō was significantly expanded in the 1960s. [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|Heavy metal]] and [[chemical industry|chemical production]] were among the highest in Japan by the 1970s.

==Industries==

The zone is a major base for the [[electric power generation]], [[petrochemical]], [[petroleum]], [[shipbuilding]], [[logistics]], [[shipping]], and [[steel]] industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Japan |title=Keiyō Industrial Region |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2012-12-19 |year=2012 |publisher=Netto Adobansusha |location=Tokyo |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Port of Chiba]] is a major component to the Keiyō Industrial Region.

Language workbenches support [[language-oriented programming]]. Language workbenches were introduced and popularized by [[Martin Fowler]] in 2005.

Language workbenches usually support:&lt;ref name="langworkb" /&gt;
* Specification of the language concepts or [[metamodel]]
* Specification of the editing environments for the [[domain-specific language]]
* Specification of the execution semantics, e.g. through interpretation and [[Automatic programming|code generation]]

==Examples==
* [[JetBrains MPS]] is a tool for designing domain-specific languages. It uses projectional editing which allows overcoming the limits of language parsers, and building DSL editors, such as ones with tables and diagrams. It implements language-oriented programming. MPS combines an environment for language definition, a language workbench, and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for such languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/|title=JetBrains MPS: Domain-Specific Language Creator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Xtext]] is an open-source software framework for developing programming languages and domain-specific languages (DSLs). Unlike standard parser generators, Xtext generates not only a parser, but also a class model for the abstract syntax tree. In addition, it provides a fully featured, customizable Eclipse-based IDE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eclipse.org/Xtext/|title=Xtext}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Kermeta]] is an open-source academic language workbench. &lt;ref name="JézéquelCombemale2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jézéquel|first1=Jean-Marc|last2=Combemale|first2=Benoit|last3=Barais|first3=Olivier|last4=Monperrus|first4=Martin|last5=Fouquet|first5=François|title=Mashup of metalanguages and its implementation in the Kermeta language workbench|journal=Software &amp; Systems Modeling|volume=14|issue=2|year=2013|pages=905–920|doi=10.1007/s10270-013-0354-4|url=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00829839/file/mashup-of-meta-languages.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kermeta workbench uses three different meta-languages: one meta-language for the abstract syntax (aligned with [[Emof]]); one for the static semantics (aligned with [[Object Constraint Language|OCL]]) and one for the behavioral semantics (called the Kermeta Language itself).

The information about its existence was raised during research and interviews carried out by Alex Gibney for his ''[[Zero Days]]'' documentary film.

This was to be achieved by electronic implants in Iranian computer networks. &lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/world/middleeast/us-had-cyberattack-planned-if-iran-nuclear-negotiations-failed.html | date = 2016-02-17 | title = US Had Cyberattack Planned if Iran Nuclear Negotiations Failed | first1 = David | last = Sanger | first2 = Mark | last2 = Mazzetti | work = New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was seen as one pathway in alternatives to full-scale war.

[[File:Wanzijia.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A few paper clips of different colors.]]
A '''paper clip''' (or sometimes '''paperclip''') is a device used to hold sheets of paper together, usually made of [[steel]] [[wire]] bent to a looped shape. Most paper clips are variations of the ''Gem'' type introduced in the 1890s or earlier, characterized by the almost two full loops made by the wire. Common to paper clips proper is their utilization of [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] and [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] in the wire, and [[friction]] between wire and paper. When a moderate number of sheets are inserted between the two "tongues" of the clip, the tongues will be forced apart and cause torsion in the bend of the wire to grip the sheets together.

==Shape and composition==
[[File:Small-paperclip.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Paper clip]]
[[File:Assorted paperclips together.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Assorted paperclip shapes, sizes and designs]]
Paper clips usually have an oblong shape with straight sides, but may also be triangular or circular, or have more elaborate shapes. The most common material is steel or some other [[metal]], but moulded [[plastic]] is also used.
Some other kinds of paper clip use a two-piece clamping system. Recent innovations include multi-colored plastic-coated paper clips and [[spring (device)|spring]]-fastened [[binder clip]]s. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==History==
According to the Early Office Museum, the first patent for a bent wire paper clip was awarded in the United States to Samuel B. Fay, in 1867. This clip was originally intended primarily for attaching tickets to fabric, although the patent recognized that it could be used to attach papers together.&lt;ref name="officiousness"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Paper Clip|publisher=Early Office Museum|url=http://www.officemuseum.com/paper_clips.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fay received U.S. patent 64,088 on April 23, 1867. Although functional and practical, Fay's design along with the 50 other designs patented prior to 1899 are not considered reminiscent of the modern paperclip design known today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paper Clip|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/paperclip.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable paper clip design was also patented in the United States by Erlman J. Wright in 1877. This clip was advertised at that time for use in fastening newspapers.&lt;ref name="officiousness" /&gt;

[[File:Middlebrook paperclip machine patent2.gif|thumb|right|200px|Middlebrook 1899 patent for a paper clip machine showing that the Gem was already in common use (top and bottom)]]
The most common type of [[wire]] paper clip still in use, the Gem paper clip, was never patented, but it was most likely in production in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the early 1870s by "The Gem Manufacturing Company", according to the American expert on technological innovations, Professor [[Henry Petroski|Henry J. Petroski]].&lt;ref&gt;Petroski, Henry: "Polishing the Gem: A First-Year Design Project", ''[[Journal of Engineering Education]]'', October 1998, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to an 1883 article  about "Gem Paper-Fasteners", praising them for being "better than ordinary pins" for "binding together papers on the same subject, a bundle of letters, or pages of a manuscript".&lt;ref&gt;Penn, Arthur: ''The Home Library'', Appleton, New York, 1883&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1883 article had no illustration of this early "Gem", it may have been different from modern paper clips of that name. The earliest documentation of its existence is an 1894 advertisement for "Gem Paper Clips".&lt;ref name="History of the Paper Clip"&gt;[http://www.earlyofficemuseum.com/paper_clips.htm History of the Paper Clip]. Ad from Cushman &amp; Denison, 172 9th Avenue, New York City, in ''The Book-Keeper'', August 1894, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 Cushman &amp; Denison registered a trade mark for the "Gem" name in connection with paper clips. The announcement stated that it had been used since March 1, 1892, which may have been the time of its introduction in the United States.&lt;ref name="History of the Paper Clip"/&gt; Paper clips are still sometimes called "Gem clips", and in [[Swedish (language)|Swedish]] the word for any paper clip is "gem".

Definite proof that the modern type of paper clip was well known in 1899 at the latest, is the patent granted to William Middlebrook of [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Connecticut]] on April 27 of that year for a "Machine for making wire paper clips." The drawing clearly shows that the product is a perfect clip of the Gem type.&lt;ref name="Petroski2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Petroski|title=The Evolution of Useful Things: How Everyday Artifacts-From Forks and Pins to Paper Clips and Zippers-Came to be as They are.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfZ1bVoPI9EC|date=1 December 2010|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-77305-0|page=68}}; "From Pins to Paper Clips"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petroski1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Petroski|title=Invention by Design: How Engineers Get from Thought to Thing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9fs5ZUaWSRIC|year=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-46368-4|page=17}}; "Paper Clips and Design"&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Middlebrook did not mention it by name, suggests that it was already well known at the time. Since then countless variations on the same theme have been patented.  Some have pointed instead of rounded ends, some have the end of one loop bent slightly to make it easier to insert sheets of paper, and some have wires with undulations or barbs to get a better grip. In addition, purely aesthetic variants have been patented, clips with triangular, star, or round shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petroski|first1=Henry|title=Polishing the Gem: A First-Year Design Project|journal=Journal of Engineering Education|date=October 1998|volume=87|issue=4|pages=445–449|doi=10.1002/j.2168-9830.1998.tb00377.x}} Appendix: A selected list of U.S. Patents for paper clips. ''Journal of Engineering Education'', 1998, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; But the original Gem type has for more than a hundred years proved to be the most practical, and consequently by far the most popular. Its qualities—ease of use, gripping without tearing, and storing without tangling—have been difficult to improve upon.

===Unsupported claim===
It has been claimed,&lt;ref&gt;[[QI (A series)#Episode 8 "Albania"|A series, episode 8]] of ''[[QI]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Father Gregory Tillett, [https://web.archive.org/web/20041029045413/http://www.britishorthodox.org/104e.shtml review of ''The Pharaoh's Shadow: Travels in Ancient and Modern Egypt'' by Anthony Sattin], ''The Glastonbury Review'', Edition 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Trompf, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3119625 "Radical Conservatism in Herbert Spencer's Educational Thought"], ''British Journal of Educational Studies'', Vol. 17, No. 3 (Oct., 1969), pp. 267–280.&lt;/ref&gt; though apparently without evidence, that [[Herbert Spencer]], the originator of the term "[[survival of the fittest]]", invented the paper clip.  Spencer claimed in his autobiography to have invented a "binding-pin" that was distributed by Ackermann &amp; Company, and he shows a drawing of the pin in his Appendix I (following Appendix H).  This pin looked more like a modern [[Split pin|cotter pin]] than a modern paper clip, but it was designed to hold sheets of paper together. It is approximately 15&amp;nbsp;cm unfolded.

==Norwegian claim==
[[File:Vaaler kopi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Johan Vaaler]] in 1887 as a student of the [[University of Oslo|Christiania University]].]]
[[File:BI-binders.jpg|thumb|The giant paper clip in [[Sandvika]], Norway. It shows the Gem, not the one patented by Vaaler.]]

A [[Norway|Norwegian]], [[Johan Vaaler]] (1866–1910), has erroneously been identified as the inventor of the paper clip. He was granted patents in [[Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;Application dated 12 November 1899, Patentschrift no. 121067, patent granted 6 June 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the United States&lt;ref&gt;US Patent No. 675,761 June 4, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; (1901) for a paper clip of similar design, but less functional and practical, because it lacked the last turn of the wire. Vaaler probably did not know that a better product was already on the market, although not yet in Norway. His version was never manufactured and never marketed, because the superior ''Gem'' was already available.

Long after Vaaler's death his countrymen created a national myth based on the false assumption that the paper clip was invented by an unrecognised Norwegian genius.  Norwegian dictionaries since the 1950s have mentioned Vaaler as the inventor of the paper clip,&lt;ref&gt;"Binders" ''Aschehougs konversasjonsleksikon'', Oslo 1975, vol. 2, p. 695.&lt;/ref&gt; and that myth later found its way into international dictionaries and much of the international literature on paper clips.

Vaaler probably succeeded in having his design patented abroad, despite the previous existence of more useful paper clips, because patent authorities at that time were quite liberal and rewarded any marginal modification of existing inventions.&lt;ref&gt;Petroski, Henry "The Evolution of Artifacts", ''American Scientist'', Volume 80, 1992, pp. 416–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Johan Vaaler began working for ''Alfred J. Bryns Patentkontor'' in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] in 1892 and was later promoted to office manager, a position he held until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Holst, Wilhelm: "Johan Vaaler", ''Studenterne fra 1887'', Kristiania 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; As the employee of a patent office, he could easily have obtained a patent in Norway. His reasons for applying abroad are not known; it is possible that he wanted to secure the commercial rights internationally. Also, he may have been aware that a Norwegian manufacturer would find it difficult to introduce a new invention abroad, starting from the small home market.

Vaaler's patents expired quietly, while the "Gem" was used worldwide, including his own country. The failure of his design was its impracticality. Without the two full loops of the fully developed paper clip, it was difficult to insert sheets of paper into his clip. One could manipulate the end of the inner wire so that it could receive the sheet, but the outer wire was a dead end because it could not exploit the torsion principle. The clip would instead stand out like a keel, perpendicular to the sheet of paper. The impracticality of Vaaler's design may easily be demonstrated by cutting off the last outer loop and one long side from a regular Gem clip.

===National symbol===
[[File:Vaaler clip.svg|thumb|left|The paper clip patented by Johan Vaaler in 1899 and 1901.]]
The originator of the Norwegian paper clip myth was an engineer of the Norwegian national patent agency who visited Germany in the 1920s to register Norwegian patents in that country. He came across Vaaler's patent, but failed to detect that it was not the same as the then-common Gem-type clip.&lt;ref&gt;Vaaler's forgotten German patent was found by patent engineer ''Halvard Foss'' of The Norwegian Industrial Property Office (Patentstyret) while looking for patents granted to Norwegians in the German patent office. "I made this discovery known to my colleagues", Foss stated in an interview with the weekly ''[[A-magasinet]]'' no. 52, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In the report of the first fifty years of the patent agency, he wrote an article in which he proclaimed Vaaler to be the inventor of the common paper clip.&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Halvard: "Den frittstående oppfinner", ''Styret for det industrielle rettsvern 50 år'', Oslo 1961, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; This piece of information found its way into some Norwegian encyclopedias after [[World War II]].

Events of that war contributed greatly to the mythical status of the paper clip. Patriots wore them in their lapels as a symbol of [[Norwegian resistance movement|resistance]] to the [[Germany|German]] [[Military occupation|occupiers]] and local [[Nazism|Nazi]] authorities when other signs of resistance, such as flag pins or pins showing the cipher of the exiled [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII of Norway]] were forbidden. Those wearing them did not yet see them as national symbols, as the myth of their Norwegian origin was not commonly known at the time.
The clips were meant to denote solidarity and unity ("we are bound together"). The wearing of paper clips was soon prohibited, and people wearing them could risk severe punishment.&lt;ref name="Finn 1945"&gt;Bø, Finn: ''Forbuden frukt'' (First edition 1945), Oslo 1995, {{ISBN|82-509-3249-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading Norwegian encyclopedia mentioned the role of the paper clip as a symbol of resistance in a supplementary volume in 1952, but did not yet proclaim it a Norwegian invention.&lt;ref&gt;''Aschehougs konversasjonsleksikon'', supplementsbind, Oslo 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; That information was added in later editions. According to the 1974 edition, the idea of using the paper clip to denote resistance originated in [[France]]. A clip worn on a lapel or front pocket could be seen as "deux gaules" (two posts or poles) and be interpreted as a reference to the leader of the French [[Resistance during World War II|Resistance]], General [[Charles de Gaulle]].&lt;ref&gt;''Aschehougs konversasjonsleksikon'', Oslo 1974, Vol. 2, p. 695.&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-war years saw a widespread consolidation of the paper clip as a national symbol. Authors of books and articles on the history of Norwegian technology eagerly seized it to make a thin story more substantial. They chose to overlook the fact that Vaaler's clip was not the same as the fully developed Gem-type clip.&lt;ref&gt;Hesstvedt, Ola: "Den lille norske hjelperen fyller 90 år", ''[[A-magasinet]]'' nr. 52, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 a giant paper clip, almost {{convert|7|m|abbr=on}} high, was erected on the campus of a commercial college near [[Oslo]] in honour of Vaaler, ninety years after his invention was patented. But this monument shows a Gem-type clip, not the one patented by Vaaler. The celebration of the alleged Norwegian origin of the paper clip culminated in 1999, one hundred years after Vaaler submitted his application for a German patent. A commemorative stamp was issued that year, the first in a series to draw attention to Norwegian inventiveness. The background shows a facsimile of the German "Patentschrift". However, the figure in the foreground is not the paper clip depicted on that document, but the much better known "Gem". In 2005, the national biographical encyclopedia of Norway (''Norsk biografisk leksikon'') published the biography of Johan Vaaler, stating he was the inventor of the paper clip.&lt;ref&gt;"Vaaler, Johan", ''Norsk biografisk leksikon'', Kunnskapsforlaget, Oslo 2005. Vol. 9, p. 411, {{ISBN|82-573-1011-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
Wire is versatile in its nature. Thus a paper clip is a useful accessory in many kinds of mechanical work including computer work: the metal wire can be unfolded with a little force. Several devices call for a very thin rod to push a recessed button which the user might only rarely need. This is seen on most [[CD-ROM]] drives as an "emergency eject" should the power fail; also on early [[Floppy disk|floppy disk drives]] (including the early [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]]). Various [[smartphones]] require the use of a long thin object such as a paper clip to eject the [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]] and some [[Palm, Inc.|Palm]] PDAs advise the use of a paper clip to reset the device. The track ball can be removed from early [[Logitech]] pointing devices using a paper clip as the key to the bezel. A paper clip bent into a "U" can be used to start an [[Power supply#Computer power supply|ATX PSU]] without connecting it to a [[motherboard]] (connect the green to a black on the motherboard header). One or more paper clips can make a [[loopback]] device for a [[RS232]] interface (or indeed many interfaces).  A paper clip could be installed in a [[Commodore 1541]] disk-drive as a flexible head-stop. A paper clip can be used (unsafely) to temporarily bridge a blown fuse. The steel wire from a paperclip can be used in dentistry to form a [[dental post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtae.com/news/pittsburgh-dentist-admits-using-paper-clips-for-root-canals/35019798|title=Pittsburgh dentist admits using paper clips for root canals|first=Paul Van|last=Osdol|date=1 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper clips can be bent into a crude but sometimes effective [[lock picking]] device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_Vp5hqLDNcC&amp;pg=PA302&amp;dq=paperclip+crude+lockpick&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJ__b5yPDTAhVK2GMKHWWHAxoQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=paperclip%20crude%20lockpick&amp;f=false|title=The Most Forbidden Knowledge: 151 Things NO ONE Should Know How to Do|last=Powell|first=Michael|last2=Forbeck|first2=Matt|date=2013-01-18|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1440560927|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some types of [[handcuffs]] can be unfastened using paper clips. There are two approaches. The first one is to unfold the clip in a line and then twist the end in a right angle, trying to imitate a key and using it to lift the lock fixator. The second approach, which is more feasible but needs some practice, is to use the semi-unfolded clip kink for lifting when the clip is inserted through the hole where the handcuffs are closed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Derived from the words [[hydraulics]] and [[pneumatics]], '''pneudraulics''' is the term used when discussing systems on [[military aircraft]] that use either or some combination of hydraulic and pneumatic systems.  Sometimes, land tractors will have [[pneumatic tire]]s and hydraulic shovels.

The science of [[fluids]] made of both [[gas]] and [[liquid]].

A '''posted write''' is a [[bus|computer bus]] write transaction that does not wait for a write completion response to indicate success or failure of the write transaction. For a posted write, the CPU assumes that the write cycle will complete with zero wait states, and so doesn't wait for the done. This speeds up writes considerably. For starters, it doesn't have to wait for the done response, but it also allows for better [[pipelining]] of the [[datapath]] without much performance penalty.

A '''non-posted''' write requires that a bus transaction responds with a write completion response to indicate success or failure of the transaction, and is naturally much slower than a posted write since it requires a round trip delay similar to read bus transactions.

In reference to memory bus accesses, a posted write is referred to as a [[Posted Memory Writes|posted memory write (PMW)]].

[[File:PowerHUB concept by ST-Ericsson.png|thumb|right|PowerHUB concept]]

'''PowerHUB''' refers to the name of a series of [[Integrated circuit|Integrated Circuit]]s (ICs) developed by [[ST-Ericsson]], a 50/50 joint venture of [[Ericsson]] and [[STMicroelectronics]] established on February 3, 2009.

These ICs are designed for the energy management and the battery charging of mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stericsson.com/products/powerhub-power-management.jsp PowerHUB webpage, ST-Ericsson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511040650/http://stericsson.com/products/powerhub-power-management.jsp |date=2012-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first member of the PowerHUB family, the PM2300,  has been announced by ST-Ericsson on February 9, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stericsson.com/press_releases/powerhub.jsp ST-Ericsson press release: announcement of the PowerHUB] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411070418/http://www.stericsson.com/press_releases/powerhub.jsp |date=2012-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2012, ST-Ericsson introduced a new IC in this family, the PM2020, supporting the wireless charging technology standardized by the [[Wireless Power Consortium]] (WPC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.stericsson.com/blog/2012/02/power-and-energy/st-ericsson-introduces-the-first-fully-integrated-wireless-charger-for-mobile-phones-with-the-pm2020/ Blog post introducing the PM2020] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707061555/http://blog.stericsson.com/blog/2012/02/power-and-energy/st-ericsson-introduces-the-first-fully-integrated-wireless-charger-for-mobile-phones-with-the-pm2020/ |date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1544">The term '''programmable communicating thermostat''' (PCT) is used by the  [[California Energy Commission]] to describe programmable [[thermostat]]s that can receive information wirelessly. 

The first version of the PCT introduced in the 2008 building standards proceeding also required that PCTs allow temperature control during emergency events to avoid blackouts. This feature was removed after public input indicated a strong fear of the non-overrideable "big brother" feel of this feature.

A talk at the S4 SCADA security conference in January 2008 indicated adding a public key encryption scheme to the specification, giving each thermostat a random 160-bit number. The installer or homeowner would call this number in to the utility or other service provider (operator), who would then send the Operator's public key to the thermostat over [[Radio Data System|RDS]]. Using this method, the PCT would receive messages only from the operator(s) explicitly agreed to by the homeowner. 

Thermostats can also communicate wirelessly through the Internet or via a home automation technology, such as [[Insteon]]. These advanced thermostats can be adjusted via computer or Internet capable phone to allow users to adjust the temperature in their home without being present.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3000">A '''pyrolant''' (from Greek ''pyros'', fire) is an energetic material that generates hot [[flames]] upon [[combustion]]. Pyrolants are metal-based [[pyrotechnic composition]]s containing virtually any oxidizer.
The term was originally coined by Kuwahara in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;T. Kuwahara, T. Ochiachi, Burning Rate of Mg/TF Pyrolants, ''Proceedings of the 18th Int. Pyrotechnics Seminar'', '''1992''', p. 539.&lt;/ref&gt; in a paper on [[magnesium/Teflon/Viton]], to distinguish between compositions that serve as propellants and those yielding hot flames which are not necessarily suitable for propellant purposes.

''[[Thermite]]s'' constitute a subdivision of pyrolants referring to mixtures containing a narrow range of oxygen-based oxidizers only,&lt;ref&gt;H. Ellern, ''Modern Pyrotechnics'', CRC Press, '''1968''', p. 221ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. H. McLain, ''Pyrotechnics'', The Franklin Institute Press, Philadelphia, '''1980''', pp 22 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term thermite cannot be used interchangeably with "pyrolant".

A similar common term is ''[[propellant]]'', which describes either a homogeneous or composite material that generates thrust upon combustion, but which may contain fuels instead of or in addition to the metals contained in [[thermite]]s.

Pyrolants are generally characterized by high combustion temperatures (&gt; 2000 K) and high amounts of condensed reaction products at equilibrium conditions such as metal [[oxide]]s, [[fluoride]]s and [[soot]].
Typical pyrolants find use as [[pyrotechnic initiator]]s ([[zirconium|Zr]]/[[barium chromate|BaCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/107630230/ABSTRACT] T.

NASA Earth Science Technology Conference, (College Park, MD), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These products yield sample points in the [[Fourier transform]] of the brightness temperature map of the scene, and the scene itself is reconstructed by inverting the sampled transform.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Le Vine, Synthetic aperture [[radiometer]] systems, IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sensing, vol. 37, no. 12, pp. 2228-2236, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstructed image includes all of the pixels in the entire field-of-view of the antennas.

The main advantage of the STAR architecture is that it requires no mechanical scanning of an antenna. Using a static antenna simplifies the antenna system dynamics and improves the time-bandwidth product of the radiometer. Furthermore, aperture thinning reduces the overall volume and mass of the antenna system. A disadvantage is the reduction of radiometric sensitivity (or increase in rms noise) of the image due to a decrease in [[signal-to-noise ratio]] for each measurement compared to a filled aperture. Pixel averaging is required for good radiometric sensitivity.

The '''TOSCO II process''' is an above ground retorting technology for [[shale oil extraction]], which uses fine particles of [[oil shale]] that are heated in a [[Rotary kiln|rotating kiln]]. The particularity  of this process is that it use hot ceramic balls for the heat transfer between the retort and a heater. The process was tested in a 40&amp;nbsp;tonnes per hour test facility near [[Parachute, Colorado]].

In this process, oil shale is crushed smaller than {{convert|0.5|in|mm|0|}} and enters the system through pneumatic lift pipes in which oil shale is elevated by hot gas streams and preheated to about {{convert|500|°F|°C|-1|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=fossilenergy&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  After entering into retort, oil shale is mixed with hot ceramic balls with temperature from {{convert|1200|°F|°C|-1|lk=on}} to {{convert|1600|°F|°C|-1|lk=on}}. This increase the oil shale temperature to between {{convert|900|°F|°C|-1|lk=on}} and {{convert|1100|°F|°C|-1|lk=on}}, in which pyrolysis occurs. In the pyrolysis process, [[kerogen]] decomposes to [[oil shale gas]] and oil vapors, while the remainder of the oil shale forms [[spent shale]]. Vapors are transferred to a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensor]] ([[Fractional distillation|fractionator]]) for separation into various [[Fraction (chemistry)|fractions]].&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;  At the kiln passage, the spent shale and the ceramic balls are separated in a perforated rotating separation drum ([[trommel]]).&lt;ref name=fossilenergy/&gt; The crushed spent shale falls through holes in the trommel, while ceramic balls are transferred to the ball heater.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Combustible shale gas is burned in the ball heater to reheat the ceramic balls.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;

The overall thermal efficiency of TOSCO II process is low because the energy of spent shale is not recovered and much of the produced shale gas is consumed by the process itself. The efficiency could be increased by burning char (carbonaceous residue in the spent shale) instead of shale gas as a fuel of the ball heater. The process' other disadvantages are mechanical complexity and large number of moving parts. Also the lifetime of ceramic balls is limited.  Disposal of spent shale   includes environmental problems because it is very finely crushed and contains carbon residue.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;

[[File:Tipu's Tiger front view 2006AH4173.jpg|thumb|Tipu's Tiger in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A Museum]], London showing the prostrate European being attacked]]
'''Tipu's Tiger''' or '''Tippu's Tiger''' is an eighteenth-century [[automaton]] or mechanical toy created for [[Tipu Sultan]], the  ruler of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] in India. The carved and painted wood casing represents a tiger savaging a near life-size European man. Mechanisms inside the tiger and man's bodies make one hand of the man move, emit a wailing sound from his mouth and grunts from the tiger. In addition a flap on the side of the tiger folds down to reveal the keyboard of a small [[pipe organ]] with 18 notes.

The tiger was created for Tipu and makes use of his personal emblem of the tiger and expresses his hatred of his enemy, the British of the [[East India Company]]. The tiger was discovered in his [[Tipu Sultan's Summer Palace|summer palace]] after East India Company troops [[Battle of Seringapatam|stormed Tipu's capital]] in 1799. The [[Governor-General of India|Governor General]], [[Lord Mornington]] sent the tiger to Britain initially intending it to be an exhibit in the [[Tower of London]]. First exhibited to the London public in 1808 in [[East India House]], then the offices of the East India Company in London, it was later transferred to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (V&amp;A) in 1880 (accession number 2545(IS)).&lt;ref name="V&amp;A web"&gt;{{cite web

==Background==
[[File:Tipu's Tiger with keyboard on display 2006AH4168.jpg|thumb|Tipu's Tiger with the organ keyboard visible]]
Tipu's Tiger was originally made for Tipu Sultan (also referred to as Tippoo Saib, Tippoo Sultan and other epithets in nineteenth-century literature) in the Kingdom of Mysore (today in the Indian state of [[Karnataka]]) around 1795.&lt;ref name="Tiger&amp;Thistle11"/&gt; Tipu Sultan used the tiger systematically as his emblem, employing tiger motifs on his weapons, on the uniforms of his soldiers, and on the decoration of his palaces.&lt;ref name=ModernAsianStudies&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brittlebank | first1 = K. | title = Sakti and Barakat: The Power of Tipu's Tiger. An Examination of the Tiger Emblem of Tipu Sultan of Mysore | journal = Modern Asian Studies | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 257–269 | doi =  10.2307/312813| year = 1995 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 312813 | doi-broken-date = 2018-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His throne rested upon a probably similar life-size wooden tiger, covered in gold; like other valuable treasures it was broken up for the highly organised [[Prize money|prize fund]] shared out between the British army.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;Davis, 156-157 on the throne, and 153-157 on the prize fund generally&lt;/ref&gt;

Tipu had inherited power from his father [[Hyder Ali]], a Muslim soldier who had risen to become ''dalwai'' or commander-in-chief under the ruling Hindu [[Wodeyar dynasty]], but from 1760 was in effect the ruler of the kingdom. Hyder, after initially trying to ally with the British against the [[Maratha]]s, had later become their firm enemy, as they represented the most effective obstacle to his expansion of his kingdom, and Tipu grew up with violently anti-British feelings.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|pp=23-24}}

The tiger formed part of a specific group of large [[caricature]] images commissioned by Tipu showing European, often specifically British, figures being attacked by tigers or elephants, or being executed, tortured and humiliated and attacked in other ways. Many of these were painted by Tipu's orders on the external walls of houses in the main streets of Tipu's capital, [[Seringapatam]].{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=24}} Tipu was in "[[Franco-Indian alliances#Proposals of Tippu Sahib|close co-operation]]" with the French, who were at war with Britain and still had [[French India|a presence]] in South India, and some of the French craftsmen who visited Tipu's court probably contributed to the internal works of the tiger.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|pp=24-25}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically about half an inch thick, and now much reinforced on the inside following bomb damage in World War II. There are many openings at the head end, formed to match the pattern of the inner part of the painted tiger stripes, which allow the sounds from the pipes within to be heard better, and the tiger is "obviously male". The top part of the tiger's body can be lifted off to inspect the mechanics by removing four screws. The construction of the human figure is similar but the wood is much thicker.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=66}} Examination and analysis by the V&amp;A conservation department has determined that much of the current paint has been restored or overpainted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6099083 V&amp;A Conservation in Action - Tippoo's Tiger] video, accessed, 17 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The human figure is clearly in European costume, but authorities differ as to whether it represents a soldier or civilian; the current text on the V&amp;A website avoids specifying, other than describing the figure as "European".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/object_stories/Tippoo's_tiger/index.html Tippoo's Tiger on Victoria &amp; Albert Museum website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825074241/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/object_stories/Tippoo's_tiger/index.html |date=25 August 2006 }}; to Ord-Hume he is "a European soldier" (Part 1, 21), but to de Almeida and Gilpin he is "an English gentleman" (p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation of a crank handle powers several different mechanisms inside Tipu's Tiger. A set of bellows expels air through a pipe inside the man's throat, with its opening at his mouth. This produces a wailing sound, simulating the cries of distress of the victim. A mechanical link causes the man's left arm to rise and fall. This action alters the pitch of the 'wail pipe'. Another mechanism inside the tiger's head expels air through a single pipe with two tones. This produces a "regular grunting sound" simulating the roar of the tiger. Concealed behind a flap in the tiger's flank is the small ivory keyboard of a two-stop pipe organ in the tiger's body, allowing tunes to be played.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, summarized at p. 64 and throughout in more detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of both shell and workings, and analysis of the metal content of the original brass pipes of the organ (many have been replaced), indicates that the tiger was of local manufacture. The presence of French artisans and French army engineers within Tipu's court has led many historians to suggest there was French input into the mechanism of this automaton.&lt;ref name=Archer&gt;{{cite book

==History==
[[File:Tipu's Tiger Salmond 1800.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The first published illustration of Tipu's Tiger in [[James Salmond]]'s book of 1800]]
Tipu's Tiger was part of the extensive plunder from Tipu's palace captured in the fall of Seringapatam, in which Tipu died, on 4 May 1799, at the culmination of the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]]. An ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to the Governor General of the East India Company, [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]], wrote a memorandum describing the discovery of the object:&lt;ref&gt;The St James's Chronicle, April 1800; also reported in the Edinburgh Caledonian Mercury 24 April 1800.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stronge|2009|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"In a room appropriated for musical instruments was found an article which merits particular notice, as another proof of the deep hate, and extreme loathing of Tippoo Saib towards the English. This piece of mechanism represents a royal Tyger in the act of devouring a prostrate European. There are some barrels in imitation of an Organ, within the body of the Tyger. The sounds produced by the Organ are intended to resemble the cries of a person in distress intermixed with the roar of a Tyger. The machinery is so contrived that while the Organ is playing, the hand of the European is often lifted up, to express his helpless and deplorable condition. The whole of this design was executed by Order of Tippoo Sultaun. It is imagined that this memorial of the arrogance and barbarous cruelty of Tippoo Sultan may be thought deserving of a place in the Tower of London."}}

The earliest published drawing of Tippoo's Tyger was the frontispiece for the book "A Review of the Origin, Progress and Result, of the Late Decisive War in Mysore with Notes" by [[James Salmond]], published in London in 1800. It preceded the move of the exhibit from India to England and had a separate preface titled "Description of the Frontispiece" which said:&lt;ref name="Tiger&amp;Thistle24"&gt;As quoted in {{cite web |url=http://www.tigerandthistle.net/thistle24.htm|title=2.4 Tippoo's Tiger: Frontispiece |author=Wood, Col Mark |year=2000 |website=The Tiger and the Thistle - Tipu Sultan and the Scots in India |publisher=The National Galleries of Scotland. |accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"This drawing is taken from a piece of mechanism representing a royal tyger in the act of devouring a prostrate European. There are some barrels in imitation of an organ within the body of the tyger, and a row of keys of natural notes. The sounds produced by the organ are intended to resemble the cries of a person in distress, intermixed with the roar of a tyger. The machinery is so contrived, that while the organ is playing, the hand of the European is often lifted up to express his helpless and deplorable condition.

The whole of this design is as large as life, and was executed by order of Tippoo Sultaun, who frequently amused himself with a sight of this emblematic triumph of the Khoodadaud, over the English, Sircar. The piece of machinery was found in a room of the palace at Seringapatam appropriated for the reception of musical instruments, and called the Rag Mehal.

The original wooden figure from which the drawing is taken will be forwarded, by the ships of this season, to the Chairman of the Court of Directors, to be presented to his Majesty. It is imagined that this characteristic emblem of the ferocious animosity of Tippoo Sultaun against the British Nation may not be thought undeserving of a place in the Tower of London."}}

Unlike Tipu's throne, which also featured a large tiger, and many other treasures in the palace, the materials of Tipu's Tiger had no intrinsic value, which together with its striking iconography is what preserved it and brought it back to England essentially intact. The Governors of the East India Company had at first intended to present the tiger to the Crown, with a view to it being displayed in the [[Tower of London]], but then decided but to keep it for the Company. After some time in store, during which period the first of many "misguided and wholly unjustified endeavours at "improving" the piece" from a musical point of view may have taken place, it was displayed in the reading-room of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] Museum and Library at [[East India House]] in [[Leadenhall Street]], London from July 1808.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|pp=29-31}}&lt;ref&gt;153-157&lt;/ref&gt;

It rapidly became a very popular exhibit, and the crank-handle controlling the wailing and grunting could apparently be freely turned by the public. The French author [[Gustave Flaubert]] visited London in 1851 to see the [[Great Exhibition]], writes [[Julian Barnes]], but finding nothing of interest in [[The Crystal Palace]], visited the East India Company Museum where he was greatly enamoured by Tipu's Tiger.&lt;ref name="Pritchett Symbols"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1700_1799/tipusultan/symbols/symbols.html |title=Symbols |author=Pritchett, Prof Frances W.  |year=2000 |website=Tipu Sultan of Mysore (r. 1782-99) |publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1843 it was reported that "The machine or organ ... is getting much out of repair, and does not altogether realize the expectation of the visitor".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 79&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the crank-handle disappeared, to the great relief of students using the reading-room in which the tiger was displayed, and ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' later reported that
{{quote|"These shrieks and growls were the constant plague of the student busy at work in the Library of the old India House, when the Leadenhall Street public, unremittingly, it appears, were bent on keeping up the performances of this barbarous machine. Luckily, a kind fate has deprived him of his handle, and stopped up, we are happy to think, some of his internal organs... and we do sincerely hope he will remain so, to be seen and admired, if necessary, but to be heard no more".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 79, quoting ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'', June 5, 1869, p. 766&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Leadenhall Street Museum.png|thumb|left|300px|Engraving of the East India Company Museum in Leadenhall Street. Tipu's Tiger can be seen to the left.]]

When the East India Company was taken over by the Crown in 1858, the tiger was stored in Fife House, [[Whitehall]] until 1868, when it moved down the road to the new [[India Office]], which occupied part of the building still used by today's [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. In 1874 it was moved to the India Museum in [[South Kensington]], which was in 1879 dissolved, with the collection distributed between other museums; the V&amp;A records the tiger as acquired in 1880. During World War II the tiger was badly damaged by a German bomb which brought down the roof above it, breaking the wooden casing into several hundred pieces, which were carefully pieced together after the war, so that by 1947 it was back on display. In 1955 it was exhibited in New York at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] through the summer and spring.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keats-Shelley"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=30210016 |title=News and Notes|author=Mann, Phyllis G. |journal=Keats-Shelley Journal, Vol 6.

In recent times, Tipu's Tiger has formed an essential part of museum exhibitions exploring the historical interface between Eastern and Western civilisation, colonialism, ethnic histories and other subjects, one such being held at the Victoria and Albert Museum itself in autumn 2004 titled "Encounters:the meeting of Asia and Europe, 1500&amp;ndash;1800".&lt;ref name="Jaffer (2007)"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffer |first1=Amin |editor1-first=Francisco José |editor1-last=Gomes |others=Alexandra Curvelo, Clare Anderson , Bhaswati Bhattacharya , Kévin Le Doudic , Momin Chaudhury , Samuel Berthet , Bhagwan S.

The organ was considered too fragile to travel to Scotland for the exhibition. Instead, a full-sized replica made of fibre glass and painted by Derek Freeborn, was exhibited in its place. The replica itself also had an earlier Scottish association, having been made in 1986 for 'The Enterprising Scot' exhibition, which was held to commemorate the October 1985 merger of the [[Royal Scottish Museum]] and the [[National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland]] to form a new entity - the [[National Museum of Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Tiger&amp;Thistle11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tigerandthistle.net/tiger11.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206054703/http://www.tigerandthistle.net/tiger11.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 February 2008 |title=1.1 Tippoo's Tiger |author=Unattributed |year=2000 |website=The Tiger and the Thistle - Tipu Sultan and the Scots in India |publisher=The National Galleries of Scotland. |accessdate=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Tipu's Tiger is arguably the best-known single work in the Victoria and Albert Museum as far as the general public is concerned. It is a "must-see" highlight for school-children's visits to the Victoria and Albert Museum, and functions as an iconic representation of the museum, replicated in various forms of memorabilia in the museum shops including [[postcard]]s, model kits and stuffed toys.&lt;ref name=KrommBakewell2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=KrommBakewell2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kromm|first1=Jane|last2=Bakewell|first2=Susan Benforado|title=A history of visual culture: Western civilization from the 18th to the 21st century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bO2scveOMokC&amp;pg=PA272|accessdate=17 July 2011|date=2 February 2010|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-492-1|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors can no longer operate the mechanism since the device is now kept in a glass case.

The British hunted tigers, not just to emulate the [[Mughals]] and other local elites in this "royal" sport, but also as a symbolic defeat of Tipu Sultan and any other ruler who stood in the path of British domination.&lt;ref name=Sramek2006/&gt; The tiger motif was used in the "Seringapatam medal" which was awarded to those who participated in the 1799 campaign, where the British lion was depicted as overcoming a prostrate tiger, the tiger being the dynastic symbol of Tipu's line. The Seringapatam medal was issued in gold for the highest dignitaries who were associated with the campaign as well as select officers on general duty, silver for other dignitaries, field officers and other staff officers, in copper-[[bronze]] for the non-commissioned officers and in [[tin]] for the privates. On the reverse it had a frieze of the storming of the fort while the obverse showed, in the words of a nineteenth-century tome on medals, "the BRITISH LION subduing the TIGER, the emblem of the late Tippoo Sultan's government, with the period when it was effected and the following words 'ASSUD OTTA-UL GHAULIB', signifying the Lion of God is the conqueror, or the conquering Lion of God."&lt;ref name="Carter_1893_Medals"&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = Norie and Wilson |publication-place = London |title = War medals of the British army, and how they were won |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL14047956M/War_medals_of_the_British_army_and_how_they_were_won. |last= Carter |first= Thomas |authorlink= Thomas Carter (writer) |edition = War medals of the British army, and how they were won. |publication-date = 1893 |accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tipu's Tiger is also notable as a literal image of a tiger killing a European, an important symbol in England at the time, and from about 1820 the "Death of Munro" became one of the scenes in the repertoire of [[Staffordshire pottery]] figurines.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=26}}&lt;ref name="de Almeida, 38"/&gt; Tiger-hunting in the [[British Raj]], is also considered to represent not just the political subjugation of India, but in addition, the triumph over India's environment.&lt;ref name=Sramek2006/&gt; The iconography persisted and during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] ran a political cartoon showing the Indian rebels as a tiger, attacking a victim in an identical pose to Tipu's Tiger, being defeated by the British forces shown by the larger figure of a lion.

Motives for collection of articles, such as Tipu's Tiger, are seen by literary historian Barrett Kalter as having a social and cultural context.&lt;ref name="Kalter 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kalter |first1=Barrett  |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=Review Essay: "Shopping, Collecting, and Feeling at Home" |journal=Eighteenth-Century Fiction |volume=20 |issue=3, Article 11 |pages= 469–477|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/eighteenth_century_fiction/v020/20.3.kalter.html |doi= 10.1353/ecf.0.0008|accessdate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of Western and Indian art by Tipu Sultan is seen by Kalter as motivated by the need to display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly Hindu and did not share his religion, viz. Islam.&lt;ref name="Kalter 2008"/&gt; In the case of the East India Company, collection of documents, artefacts and ''objet's d'art''&amp;nbsp; from India helped develop the idea of a subjugated Indian populace in the minds of the British people, the thought being that the possession of such objects of a culture represented understanding of, dominance over, and mastery of that culture.&lt;ref name="Kalter 2008"/&gt;

==As a musical instrument==
[[File:Tipu Sultan's Tiger.JPG|thumb|Side view, showing how the handle when turned gets in the way of the player of the keyboard]]

In a detailed study published in 1987 of the tiger's musical and noise-making functions, Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume concluded that since coming to Britain, "the instrument has been ruthlessly reworked, and in doing so much of its original operating principles have been destroyed".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 31, though his main discussion of the matter is in his Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two ranks of pipes in the organ (as opposed to the wailing and grunting functions), each "comprising eighteen notes, [which] are nominally of 4ft pitch and are [[unison]]s - i.e. corresponding pipes in each register make sounds of the same musical pitch. This is an unusual layout for a pipe organ although while selecting the two stops together results in more sound ... there is also detectable a slight beat between the pipes so creating a [[Voix céleste|celeste]] effect. ... it is considered likely that as so much work has been done ... this characteristic may be more an accident of tuning than an intentional feature".{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987b|p=69}} The tiger's grunt is made by a single pipe in the tiger's head and the man's wail by a single pipe emerging at his mouth and connected to separate [[bellows]] located in the man's chest, where they can be accessed by unbolting and lifting off the tiger. The grunt operates by cogs gradually raising the weighted "grunt-pipe" until it reaches a point where it slips down "to fall against its fixed lower-board or reservoir, discharging the air to form the grunting sound"{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987b|pp=64-66, photos 67-68}} Today all the sound-making functions rely on the crank-handle to power them, though Ord-Hume believes this was not originally the case.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p= 66}}

Works on the noise-making functions included those made over several decades by the famous organ-building firm [[Henry Willis &amp; Sons]], and Henry Willis III, who worked on the tiger in the 1950s, contributed an account to a monograph by Mildred Archer of the V&amp;A. Ord-Hume is generally ready to exempt Willis work from his scathing comments on other drastic restorations, which "vandalism" is assumed to be by unknown earlier organ-builders.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 30, and Part 2 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;
There was a detailed account of the sound-making functions in ''[[The Penny Magazine]]'' in 1835, whose anonymous author evidently understood "things mechanical and organs in particular".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 75, preceding his full reproduction of the text.&lt;/ref&gt; From this and Ord-Hume's own investigations, he concluded that the original operation of the man's "wail" had been intermittent, with a wail only being produced after every dozen or so grunts from the tiger above, but that at some date after 1835 the mechanism had been altered to make the wail continuous, and that the bellows for the wail had been replaced with smaller and weaker ones, and the operation of the moving arm altered.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p= 66}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/8973957 video] of [[David Dimbleby]] playing the grunt and wail only&lt;/ref&gt;

Puzzling features of the present instrument include the placing of the handle, which when turned is likely to obstruct a player of the keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 21&lt;/ref&gt; Ord-Hume, using the 1835 account, concludes that originally the handle (which is a nineteenth-century British replacement, probably of a French original) only operated the grunt and wail, while the organ was operated by pulling a string or cord to work the original bellows, now replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 71, 73, 75, 77, and see videos linked at the end of the section&lt;/ref&gt; The keyboard, which is largely original, is "unique in construction", with "square ivory buttons" with round [[lathe]]-turned tops instead of conventional keys. Though the mechanical functioning of each button is "practical and convenient" they are spaced such that "it is almost impossible to stretch the hand to play an octave".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 69, 73, and see videos linked at the end of the section&lt;/ref&gt; The buttons are marked with small black spots, differently placed but forming no apparent pattern in relation to the notes produced and corresponding to no known system of marking keys.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 69, and see videos linked at the end of the section&lt;/ref&gt; The two stop control knobs for the organ are located, "rather confusingly", a little below the tiger's testicles.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 64&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is now rarely played, but there is a V&amp;A video of a recent performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6699473 Vimeo.com] ''Conservation in Action - Playing Tippoo's Tiger Part 2'', and [http://vimeo.com/6099330 ''Part 1'', with the top of the tiger removed], accessed 17 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Valentino Braitenberg''' (or ''Valentin von Braitenberg''; 18 June 1926 – 9 September 2011) was an Italian [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and [[cybernetics|cyberneticist]]. He was former director at the [[Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics]] in [[Tübingen]], [[Germany]].

His book ''[[Braitenberg vehicle|Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology]]'' became famous in Robotics and among Psychologists, in which he described how hypothetical [[analog robot|analog]] [[Braitenberg Vehicles|vehicles]] (a combination of [[sensors]], [[actuators]] and their interconnections), though simple in design, can exhibit behaviors akin to [[aggression]], [[love]], [[foresight (psychology)|foresight]], and [[optimism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/~beall/vehicles.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These have come to be known as [[Braitenberg vehicles]]. His pioneering scientific work was concerned with the relation between structures and functions of the [[brain]].

==Life==
Valentino Braitenberg grew up in the province of [[South Tyrol]]. Braitenberg's father was Senator {{Interlanguage link multi|Carl von Braitenberg|de}},&lt;ref&gt;Z am Sonntag, Nr. 37/2011 vom 11. September 2011; S.3&lt;/ref&gt; a member of the South Tyrolean nobility.

Since the age of 6, Braitenberg grew up bilingual in the two languages Italian and German. German was spoken at home and all schooling was Italian, conform to the historic context. The humanistic Lyceum-Gymnasium (High school) in Bolzano gave him an excellent classic education including Italian literature. The German literary education was based on the classical writers he found in the extensive home library. In addition, he trained as a violinist at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Conservatorio Claudio Monteverdi|it}} in Bolzano and became a talented violinist and violist.

Braitenberg studied Medicine and Psychiatry at the Universities of Innsbruck and Rome between 1945 and 1954. He accompanied his studies with chamber music performances with his viola and violin, where he developed a repertoire of violin-piano duos with a colleague.   . He completed his medical training with an internship at the psychiatric clinic in Rome, where he decided to prefer a scientific career dedicated to the understanding of brain functions. He spent a few years at Yale University in New Haven (USA) when he was invited by Prof. [[Eduardo Caianiello]] in 1958 to set up a biocybernetics research group at the Physics Institute of the [[University of Naples Federico II]], the “Laboratorio di Cibernetica”. Between 1958 and 1968 he was adjunct Professor of Cybernetics at the Physics Institute of the University of Naples. In 1963 Braitenberg earned the Libera Docenza in Cybernetics and Information Theory, the title that used to grant access to Professorship at Italian Universities. From 1968 until his retirement in 1994 he was co-founder and co-Director of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen and Honorary Professor at the Universities of Tübingen and Freiburg. After 1994 he was appointed Professor at the Specialization School in Scienze Motorie (Motoric Sciences) at the Rovereto branch of the University of Rovereto. From 1998 to 2001 he was president of the Laboratorio di Scienze Cognitive at the [[University of Trento]] in [[Rovereto]].

Braitenberg received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Salzburg]] in 1995.

Braitenberg was married to the painter Elisabeth Hanna. They had three children, Margareta, Carla, and Zeno.

== Works ==

According to Maier (2012),&lt;ref&gt;
Maier, E. (2012). Spying on God. MaxPlanckResearch Magazine, 12(3), 86-87. Retrieved from http://www.mpg.de/6348834/S005_Flashback_086-087.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Braitenberg's interest in understanding the brain began in 1948, when he looked for the first time at some human brain tissue under a microscope. He said that although the connections seemed unbelievably complex, Braitenberg eventually realised that computers could serve as a useful model for understanding the brain. She said that he made seminal contributions to understanding the [[neuroanatomy]] of the [[cerebellum]], the wiring of the eye of the [[fly]], and the organisation of the human [[cerebrum]].

Braitenberg published more than 180 scientific works during his lifetime, not including abstracts, reprints, translations into different languages, and different editions of some of his works.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.braitenberg.eu&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a search of Google Scholar in September 2014, Braitenberg's book,  ''Vehicles: Experiments in synthetic psychology'', had received at least 2622 citations.

'''WT1190F''' ('''9U01FF6''', '''UDA34A3''', or '''UW8551D''') was a small temporary satellite of Earth that impacted Earth on 13 November 2015 at 06:18:34.3 (±1.3 seconds) [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]].&lt;ref name="SETI"/&gt; It is thought to have been [[space debris]] from the [[trans-lunar injection]] stage of the 1998 [[Lunar Prospector]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Watson |first=Traci |date=13 January 2016|title=Falling space debris traced to 1998 lunar mission |doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19162|url=http://www.nature.com/news/falling-space-debris-traced-to-1998-lunar-mission-1.19162|newspaper=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|location= |access-date=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="space junk"&gt;{{cite news |last=Watson |first=Traci |url=http://www.nature.com/news/incoming-space-junk-a-scientific-opportunity-1.18642 |title=Incoming space junk a —scientific opportunity |work=Nature News |date=23 October 2015 |accessdate=2015-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first discovered on 18 February 2013 by the [[Catalina Sky Survey]].&lt;ref name="mpmlinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gizmag1023"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wood |first=Chris |url=http://www.gizmag.com/esa-rocket-reentry-observations/40021/ |title=ESA to study rare rocket body reentry to improve predictive models |work=Gizmag.com |date=2015-10-23 |accessdate=2015-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then lost, and reacquired on 29 November 2013. It was again discovered on 3 October 2015, and the object was soon identified to be the same as the two objects previously sighted by the team, who have been sharing their data through the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s [[Minor Planet Center]] (MPC).&lt;ref name="ESA prediction"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reentry data will help improve prediction models|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Reentry_data_will_help_improve_prediction_models|website = European Space Agency|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early orbit calculation showed that it was orbiting Earth in an extremely elliptical orbit, taking it from within the [[Geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous satellite ring]] to nearly twice the distance of the Moon.&lt;ref name="orbitandobs"/&gt; It was also probably the same object as 9U01FF6, another object on a similar orbit discovered on 26 October 2009.

WT1190F had been orbiting Earth as a temporary satellite since mid 2009 (named as '''UWAIS'''), if not longer. While it has not been positively identified with any known artificial satellites, its estimated density of 0.1 g/cm³ was much lower than would be expected of a natural object as even water has a density of 1 g/cm³.  Hence, [[European Space Agency]] astronomers have concluded that the object was likely a fuel tank of some sort.&lt;ref name="mpmlinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gizmag1023"/&gt;

After more observations, astronomers determined that the object would impact the Earth on 13 November 2015 at 06:18 UTC (11:48 local time),&lt;ref name="SETI"/&gt; south of [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name="mpmlinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gizmag1023"/&gt; Due to its small size, it was expected that most or all of the object would burn up in the atmosphere before impacting, but would be visible as a bright daytime [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]] if the sky was not badly [[overcast]].&lt;ref name="mpmlinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gizmag1023"/&gt;

A ground-based observational campaign was organized as a possible test for future collision events involving also natural bodies.&lt;ref name="Icarus2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Micheli|first=Marco|last2=Buzzoni|first2=Alberto|last3=Koschny|first3=Detlef|last4=Drolshagen|first4=Gerhard|last5=Perozzi|first5=Ettore|last6=Hainaut|first6=Olivier|last7= Lemmens|first7=Stijn|last8=Altavilla|first8=Giuseppe|last9=Foppiani|first9=Italo

==Observations==
[[File:Object WT1190F.gif|thumb|left|Bright object in the center is WT1190F as observed by the University of Hawaii 2.2-meter telescope.]]
WT1190F was first discovered by the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]], a participant in the [[Catalina Sky Survey]] [[Near-Earth Object]] surveying program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/programs/catalina.html |title=Catalina Sky Surveys |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=2013-03-05 |accessdate=2015-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object was identified with an [[apparent magnitude]] 19.5 on 18 February 2013, and given the temporary designation UDA34A3, but was lost soon after, with an [[observation arc]] of only 5 hours.&lt;ref name="initialtracking"&gt;{{cite web|title="Pseudo-MPEC" for UDA34A3 = UW8551D|url=http://www.projectpluto.com/pluto/mpecs/uda.htm|website=Project Pluto|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was again seen by the same survey on 29 November 2013 and given the designation UW8551D and lost again, only being observed for 1 hour 35 minutes.&lt;ref name="initialtracking" /&gt;

Most recently, it was recovered on 3 October 2015 and given the designation WT1190F. Its orbit was soon calculated and found to be orbiting Earth, but not with the orbit of any known artificial satellite. The object's orbit was soon connected, allowing more observations to be made, and several [[precovery]] observations have been found of the object, dating back to June 2009.&lt;ref name=epoch2011/&gt;

The type of orbit that WT1190F had was not stable long-term. An object in this type of orbit was likely to impact into Earth or the Moon, or acquire enough [[orbital speed]] to be ejected into orbit around the Sun.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; It was not likely that it had been orbiting Earth for decades.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; In 2011 the orbit had an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.33 and [[perigee]] (closest approach to Earth) of {{convert|248000|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=epoch2011/&gt; It passed about {{convert|22000|km|abbr=on}} from the Moon on 24 May 2012.&lt;ref name=mpec_all/&gt; By 2013 the eccentricity had increased to 0.70 and the perigee decreased to {{convert|105000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="initialtracking"/&gt;

During WT1190F's orbit, it changed significantly in brightness, from an [[apparent magnitude]] 16 at [[Apsis|perigee]], to magnitude 23 at [[Apsis|apogee]]. It spent most of its time dimmer than magnitude 20.&lt;ref name="orbitandobs"/&gt; This, combined with [[Radiation pressure|solar pressure acceleration]], the [[Yarkovsky effect]], and frequent orbital perturbations by the Moon, made it difficult to precisely predict its orbit and location. About one hour before atmospheric entry, the object had a R magnitude of 13.6,&lt;ref name="DASO537"/&gt;{{refn|Even near apparent magnitude ~13.6 it was about 1000 times too faint to be seen by the naked eye.

===Airborne observations ===
[[File:G450 Wt1190f 1.jpg|thumb|left|Gulfstream 450 business jet rented for the mission]]

The International Astronomical Center (IAC) and the [[United Arab Emirates Space Agency]] observed WT1190F as it fell towards the Earth. The IAC chartered a [[Gulfstream 450]] jet to bring researchers such as [[Peter Jenniskens]] to the area of WT1190F's impact, at a high altitude, to view the event over clouds or haze.&lt;ref name=UAE/&gt; The Next TC3 Consortium Asteroid Detection and Early Warning team narrowed the atmospheric entry time to ±1.3 seconds.&lt;ref name="SETI"/&gt;

Observers on the ground could not see the fireball because of rain, but the plane was able to find an opening in the clouds.&lt;ref name="SETI"/&gt; The fireball was a bright [[naked eye]] object.&lt;ref name="SETI"/&gt; [[Astronomical spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] data was acquired that will help determine what the object was made of.&lt;ref name="SETI"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6979">'''Willy Sachs''' (23 July 1896 – 19 November 1958) was a [[German people|German]] [[industrialist]]. He served the [[Third Reich]] as ''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' and ''[[Wehrwirtschaftsführer]]'' and was awarded the [[Federal Cross of Merit]] after the [[Second World War]]. Sachs was an honorary citizen of [[Schweinfurt]], Mainberg and [[Oberaudorf]].

== Biography ==
[[File:MainbergWinter.jpg|thumb|286px|Schloss Mainberg (2005)]]
Willy Sachs was born in Schweinfurt, the only son of the industrialist [[Ernst Sachs]]. After internships with several international companies Sachs joined his father's company in 1923 as a board member, and upon the senior Sachs' death in 1932, became the sole owner of [[ZF Sachs|Fichtel &amp; Sachs AG]] in Schweinfurt. Sachs was seen as a caring patriarch, often given to spontaneous generosity. He saw it as his mission in life to share his father's work with the next generation. However, he inherited little of his father's talent at management. Although he held the title of General Director, the company of 7,000 workers was, by 1939, actually run by its directors Heinz Kaiser, Rudolf Baier and Michael Schlegelmilch. Sachs turned to hunting, women, and alcohol as diversions. His lavish parties at [[Schloss Mainberg]] and on the Rechenau became legendary. It was said, "wherever there was a party, the consul [Sachs] was there." (Sachs had inherited the title of Royal Swedish Consul from his father upon whom it had been bestowed for his work with [[SKF]].)

In 1933, Sachs became a member of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]&lt;ref name=ss/&gt;&lt;ref name=stadium/&gt; and the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref name=Nazi/&gt; As the head of an important arms manufacturer, he was named ''Wehrwirtschaftsführer'' ["War Industry Leader"]. [[Heinrich Himmler]] awarded him medals and honorary titles (including ''Obersturmbannführer'' in 1943) and helped with Sachs' divorce from Elinor von Opel and the ensuing custody battle for their children. [[Hermann Göring]] was a guest of Sachs' hunting outings in Mainberg.

[[File:Willy Sachs Stadion 001.jpg|thumb|286px|right|Willy-Sachs-Stadion (2017)]]
In 1936, as patron of [[1. FC Schweinfurt 05]], Sachs donated the stadium that bears his name, the [[Willy-Sachs-Stadion]] in Schweinfurt.&lt;ref name="Schweinfurtführer History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Geschichte des FC 05 Schweinfurt |trans-title=FC Schweinfurt 05 History|periodical=|publisher=www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de | url=https://www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de/geschichte/geschichte-des-fc-05-schweinfurt/ | deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-08-21|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ThirdReichRuins"&gt;{{cite web|title=Schweinfurt Under the Swastika|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=www.thirdreichruins.com|url=http://www.thirdreichruins.com/schweinfurt6.htm| deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-08-21|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This gift to the city secured his lasting popularity beyond death. As part of the Schweinfurt ''Lest we forget'' initiative, the local press (including ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', Gerhard Fischer and Werner Skrentny) initiated a campaign to rename the stadium due to Sachs' Nazi affiliation. The campaign met with low approval among the general public.&lt;ref name="Tom Kleine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Der braune Fleck von Schweinfurt|trans-title=Schweinfurt's brown spot|periodical=|publisher=tomkleine.jimdo.com|url=https://tomkleine.jimdo.com/2017/02/27/der-braune-fleck-von-schweinfurt/|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-08-21|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1945, Sachs was arrested by the American military in [[Oberaudorf]] and held until February 1947. During the [[denazification]] process following World War II, he was twice labeled a "follower" (Category IV). Author [[Wilfried Rott]] has labeled this process a "whitewashing".&lt;ref name=Rott/&gt;

After his release, at the age of 51, Sachs officially retired from active management and was relegated as Chairman of the Supervisory Board to ceremonial duties. In recognition of his philanthropy (including restoration of the Ernst Sachs Assistance organization as the Occupation Pensions Authority), Sachs was awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Order of Merit]].

Sachs spent his last years mostly on the family estate (Sachs Rechenau) at [[Oberaudorf]]. On November 19, 1958, he committed suicide at the age of 62, driven by depression&lt;ref name=sud/&gt; and fear of [[blackmail]]. Willy Sachs was laid to rest to the great sympathy of the populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auf Ehrenbürger sollte kein Schatten fallen|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=www.mainpost.de|url=http://www.mainpost.de/regional/schweinfurt/Auf-Ehrenbuerger-sollte-kein-Schatten-fallen;art742,4819498|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-08-21|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Sachs was married to Elinor von Opel, daughter of [[Wilhelm von Opel]], from 1925 to 1935. They had two sons: Ernst Wilhelm (1929-1977) and [[Gunter Sachs|Gunter]] (1932-2011).
From 1937 to 1947, he was married to Ursula Meyer, of [[Prey, Vosges]].
Following his 1947 divorce, Sachs lived with his partner Catherine Hirnböck, with whom he had one child: Peter Sachs (born 1950). Sachs officially adopted Peter in 1957.
