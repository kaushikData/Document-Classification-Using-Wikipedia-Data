'''''11:14''''' is a 2003 American-Canadian [[independent film|indie]] [[black comedy]] film written and directed by [[Greg Marcks]].

The film was edited in a way that the various scenes of the movie all take place around the pivotal time of 11:14 PM.

==Plot==
{{Long plot|section|date=January 2017}}
The film involves a series of interconnected events that converge around two car-related accidents at 11:14&amp;nbsp;p.m.  The connections between the events are not apparent at first, but are gradually revealed by a series of progressively receding [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s:

===Part 1===

'''11:13 - 11:33'''
::Jack, who has been drinking, is seen driving along a road at night talking on his cell phone.  The clock on the dashboard reads 11:14 p.m.  Suddenly, as he drives under an overpass, something smashes across the windshield, causing him to skid off the road.  He stops by a deer crossing sign and gets out to inspect the damage, and finds a human body with a badly mutilated face lying close to his car.  When he sees another car approaching, he panics and drags the body out of sight.  The car pulls up next to him, and the driver, Norma, assumes that he hit a deer. She offers to call the police over Jack's protests, insisting that it is no trouble because she has a new cell phone that she "never uses" and because she is friends with the Chief of Police.  Norma offers Jack a ride to her house to wait for the police, but he declines.  When she drives off, Jack decides to hide the body in the trunk of his car.  He gets back into the car to pull away, but a police officer pulls up behind him.  Officer Hannagan speaks with Jack and, noting his odd behavior, asks him if he would submit to a breathalyzer test.  Jack requests a sobriety test instead, which Hannagan administers, getting him to recite the alphabet in reverse from Z to A.  When the officer checks with dispatch, he finds that Jack's license has been revoked for driving under the influence.  Hannagan tells Jack that he is under arrest and that his car will be impounded.  When he finds the body in the trunk, Hannagan handcuffs Jack with a cable tie and tells the two people already in the back of the cruiser, Duffy, and Buzzy, to move over so that Jack will fit.  While Hannagan argues with Buzzy, who refuses to move over, Jack is able to pull clippers out of his pocket, cut the cable tie, and escape.  Hannagan pursues, leaving the cruiser door open, and Duffy and Buzzy also escape.  Jack runs across a property with security lights and a dog, causing the owner, Norma, to come out.  She is obviously upset and is looking for her husband, Frank, because she just received a phone call that their daughter, Cheri, was killed in a hit-and-run accident.  Hannagan catches up to Jack at this point, and Norma angrily strikes Jack with a flashlight, assuming that he is responsible for her daughter's death.  He flees again, into the cemetery where he trips over a bowling ball and is again taken into custody.

===Part 2===

'''11:09 - 11:29'''
::Teenagers Tim, Mark, and Eddie are driving around causing trouble by throwing things out of the windows of Mark's mother's van, including a jelly donut, which hits an oncoming car, and a book they have set on fire.  Mark, distracted by Eddie urinating out the van's window, runs into and kills Cheri, who was crossing the road while on her cell phone.  They stop, but flee the scene when Duffy comes toward the van with a gun.  As Duffy fires on the retreating van, Tim realizes that the accident also caused the van's window to snap shut, cutting off Eddie's penis.  Eddie insists that they all go back to the site of the crash because he doesn't want to live without his penis; feeling sorry for Eddie, Tim volunteers to go back in an effort to find the penis.  Tim is accosted by the paramedics, Leon and Kevin at the scene, but manages to escape and get the severed penis back to Eddie.

===Part 3===

'''11:04 - 11:24'''
::Frank is walking his dog late at night and discovers his daughter's Cheri's car keys next to the dead body of Aaron, in the cemetery. Thinking his daughter is responsible for the death, Frank packs the body in the trunk of Aaron's car, accidentally locking the keys in with the body.  He uses a rock to break a window and get into the car, then drives to a bridge.  He has to hide from a car driven by Duffy that passes by, but then disposes of the body by dropping it over the side of the bridge, where it lands on Jack's car (as seen at the start of the film).  His dog runs off with the blood-soaked jacket.  He chases the dog, eventually catching it.  He sees the burning book that the teenagers threw on the sidewalk, and uses it to set his jacket on fire.  His wife, Norma, sees him and gives him a ride home, where she sends him out to look for the deer that Jack supposedly hit.

===Part 4===

'''10:59 - 11:19'''
::Buzzy is working at a convenience store late at night. Her friend and co-worker, Duffy, arrives and they begin discussing Cheri's pregnancy and money needed for an abortion.  Mark and Eddie arrive after the store is closed but Duffy lets them come in.  They are there to buy items to throw out the van windows. After they leave, Duffy tells Buzzy his plan to steal from the store the $500 required to pay for the abortion.  Cheri arrives and she and Duffy go into the cooler.  Meanwhile Buzzy is playing around with Duffy's revolver (the one he plans to use to rob the store) and she accidentally shoots a bullet through a glass door of a refrigerator, barely missing Duffy and Cheri.  Cheri leaves and Duffy asks Buzzy to allow him to steal the money from the convenience store's cash register.  Buzzy objects, fearful of losing her job, but relents, while insisting that Duffy shoot her in the arm to make it look like an authentic robbery.  He shoots her in the arm and then dials [[9-1-1]] for her, leaving while she is on the phone.  Duffy looks for his keys, barely escaping the police who are arriving more quickly than he thought they would.  While driving away, he passes by Aaron's car, where Frank has parked it preparing to dispose of Aaron's body.  Duffy then sees Cheri parked and tells her he got the money for her abortion. When she gets out of her car, he witnesses the teenagers' van knocking down and killing Cheri, and he shoots at the teenagers.  He is then arrested by Officer Hannagan for shooting at the van and for the store robbery, based on the description someone phoned in (later revealed to be Cheri).  Buzzy is arrested as an accomplice when she refuses to identify Duffy and admits to conspiring with him.

===Part 5===

'''10:54 - 11:14'''
::Cheri leaves her house to have sex with Aaron at the cemetery.  Aaron is reclining against a tombstone that has a stone angel on top.  The angel's neck is damaged and the heavy stone head falls onto Aaron's face, killing him instantly and mutilating his face.  Cheri runs away from the scene, not realizing that she has dropped the set of keys that Frank found in the earlier scene.  Cheri borrows her father's car and goes to the convenience store to get Duffy's bowling ball, intending to replace the angel head with the bowling ball and implicate Duffy as killing Aaron.  As she drives away from the store, she sees the shooting and reports a description of Duffy to the police.  When Cheri arrives back at the cemetery, she drops the bowling ball when she sees that Aaron's body is gone.  She tries to leave, but her car is again having trouble starting. Her cell phone rings, and she begins talking to Jack.  This is the phone conversation the movie begins with, continued to inform the viewer that Cheri's "pregnancy" is actually a scam to get money from both Duffy and Aaron, so that Cheri and Jack can leave town together with the money.  In the midst of the call, Duffy calls out Cheri's name from across the street to tell her that he got the $500 she wanted him to get.  Cheri hangs up quickly, and while she is crossing the street, the cell phone rings again, and, distracted, she stops in the middle of the road, where she is hit by the van containing Mark, Tim, and Eddie.  The camera pans to Cheri's cell phone, which reads 11:14 p.m.

'''''Bangai-O Spirits'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Nihongo|'''''Bangai-O Spirits'''''|バンガイオー魂|Bangaiō Supirittsu}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[action game]] for the [[Nintendo DS]], and the sequel to ''[[Bangai-O]]'' which was released on the [[Nintendo 64]] and [[Dreamcast]].

''Bangai-O Spirits'' is a side-scrolling shooting game with free-scrolling levels that extend horizontally and vertically. The player controls a robot with the ability to fly, but is still affected by gravity. He has seven weapons to choose from, and can perform melee attacks using a [[baseball bat]] or [[sword]].

The game has 160 levels, and features a level editor to create more. Edited levels can be encoded in a sound that can be recorded with a computer and shared between players. This technology was inspired by the [[Compact Cassette#Data recording|datacasettes]] used by some older computers, including the [[Sharp X1]] on which Matsumoto learned to program.

==Plot==
Bangai-O Spirits has very little story line, and is not part of the same continuity as the previous game. The two new pilots are called Masato (boy) and Ruri (girl). The campaign mode is limited to a brief set of tutorial stages.

Upon completing all of the stages under "Treasure's Best" in free mode, a brief cutscene will play, with one of the characters saying "We're only here because the fanboys would throw a fit on the internet if the game didn't have an ending."

==Production==
In a rare breach of the company's usual secrecy about future plans, developer Yoshiyuki Matsumoto first hinted at a sequel to ''Bangai-O'' in a 2003 interview on Sega's website to promote the game ''[[Astro Boy: Omega Factor]]''. When asked what game he would like to create next, he said he would like to "carry out ''Bakuretsu Muteki Bangai-O's'' revenge." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sega.jp/fb/creators/vol_25/2.html|title=開発者インタビュー「Creators Note」 ＃２５ やいまん|publisher=[{Sega]]|accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treasure began working on a concept demo before a publisher was involved. Full production followed the completion of their previous handheld release, ''[[Bleach: Dark Souls]]''. When publisher ESP approached them about a possible collaboration, ''Bangai-O'' seemed like a logical fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/25/treasure-talks-bangai-o-for-ds|title=Treasure Talks Bangai-O for DS|author=Craig Harris|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=2008-02-25|accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, 2007, [[Weekly Famitsu]] announced the game officially, and it was demonstrated at [[Tokyo Game Show]] later that month.

==Localization==
On August 12, 2008, the game has been released in North American by [[D3 Publisher]] of America.

Treasure has handled the localization for the game in-house, adding features they did not have time to include in the Japanese release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3166696&amp;p=39 Bangai-O Spirits Nintendo DS Preview, Bangai-O Spirits Preview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Treasure previously did this with the North American version of ''[[Astro Boy: Omega Factor]]'', which featured new enemies, difficulty modes, and refined level layouts, and is generally considered a stronger product than the original Japanese version.{{cn|date=September 2008}}

==Gameplay==

===Weapons===
The player is able to choose two weapons from a list that includes various missiles, melee weapons, and a defensive shield.

===EX Weapons===
The player is also able to choose two EX weapons from a list of homing, napalm, rebound, break, direction, reflector, and freeze. The use of the EX Attack unleashes loads of missiles. More missiles will be fired the longer one charges the attack, and the closer one is to enemy projectiles. The exception is the freeze EX Attack, which "freezes" the screen, but this is still affected by the amount of projectiles en route to the player. The direction EX attack sends all of the attack at a single enemy, while the reflector EX attack reflects all the enemy fire.

===Other abilities===
Also added is the ability for the player to dash. While dashing the player moves forward faster than normal and is able to both damage and travel through enemies and scenery but cannot fire.

A new defensive skill is the ability to knockback enemies and objects. The bat, dash, and reflect EX are the only ways to knockback enemies. Enemies that are knockedback can knockback other enemies which could cascade into a very large and damaging "wave" of knockedback enemies.

'''''Blaster Master: Blasting Again''''' (known simply as '''''Blaster Master''''' in Japan) is the fifth [[Video game|game]] in the ''Blaster Master'' series. It was released for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. The release of [[Blaster Master|the original game]] had a different plot, but this title is a follow-up to the ''[[Worlds of Power]]'' adaptation in all regions.  It was released in Japan on July 13, 2000, and was supposed to be released in North America on November 7, 2000,&lt;ref name=GI/&gt; but issues with the game caused it to be delayed until it got a release on May 6, 2001.

==Introduction==
''Blaster Master: Blasting Again'' is a third-person [[Action game|3D platformer]] that puts the player at the controls of the high-tech, all-terrain combat vehicle SOPHIA J-7. The player navigates through several areas of caverns to uncover and ultimately stop the treacherous plans of a mysterious alien race of Lightning Beings. On some occasions the player's character must exit SOPHIA and go solo through alien complexes. As the game progresses, the player will earn upgrades for SOPHIA, and be able to salvage weapon upgrades for the pilot. The player views cut-scenes that convey the key elements in the story. The character will fight a boss at the end of each stage.

==Production==
Although the game is a sequel to the original ''Blaster Master'' for the NES, the writers of ''Blasting Again'' used elements from the ''[[Worlds of Power]]'' novelization of ''Blaster Master'' in the game's storyline. Particularly, the character of Eve, an original character from the novel who was not in the NES game, was introduced in ''Blasting Again'' as the wife of Jason and the mother of Roddy and Elfie. The novel's author, Peter Lerangis, felt "honored" for the privilege.&lt;ref name="BehindWorlds3"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Struck |first1=Shawn |last2=Sharkey |first2=Scott |date=August 3, 2006 |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=2&amp;cId=3152540 |title=8-Bit Lit: Inside the NES' ''Worlds of Power'' Series (Page 3) |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=November 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709142922/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=2&amp;cId=3152540 |archivedate=July 9, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

There once was a boy named Jason, who had a pet frog.  One day the frog, bored with his microenvironment, decided to explore the world.  Hopping outside, he fell into a mysterious hole in the backyard.  The tiny frog landed on a pile of boxes containing radioactive materials.  The exposure to the materials led to an immediate mutation, and the frog swelled to ten times his original size.  Unfazed, the big frog hopped off down the mysterious tunnel he found himself in, to see what he could see.  Jason, meanwhile, upset at his pet's disappearance, began searching frantically.  He too found the mysterious hole, but when he reached the bottom, there was a strange vehicle waiting for him - Sophia III.  And, since nobody else was around, Jason thought he'd drive Sophia around to look for his frog.  Donning a battle suit he finds with the vehicle, Jason embarks on a journey that will forever change his life.

===History===
Jason encounters an alien race, known as the Lightning Beings, living in caverns beneath the Earth's crust.  These aliens have begun preparations for a hostile takeover of the planet.  Luckily for humanity, Jason ''really'' wants his frog back.  Eventually Jason squares off with the mighty Plutonium Boss, leader of the Lightning Beings, and defeats him.  The aliens, leaderless, scatter, and from afar, Jason watches as their world collapses upon them...watches with Sophia, and his frog.

But Jason's combat with the Lightning Beings was far from over.  He learns that Sophia is actually a combat vehicle developed by another alien race trying to stop the parasitic exploits of the Lightning Beings.  Teaming up with Eve, an alien Sophia pilot, Jason sallies forth to mop up the remaining Lightning Beings.  Successful in combat, with the prospect of lasting peace before them, Jason and Eve marry and settle on Earth, and have two children named Elfie and Roddy.

===Prelude===
Five years ago, Eve died. A couple of years later, Jason is killed in a ferocious attack by Lightning Beings.  With the planet threatened by mysterious geologic phenomena and natural disasters, Elfie and Roddy take up the legacy of their parents, and, though young and with little experience, pledge to protect humanity from the evil machinations of the Lightning Beings.  Sophia has been modified and rebuilt through the years, by both Jason and Elfie, and now exists as Sophia J-7.  Elfie continues to develop new parts to upgrade Sophia's abilities. The story begins with Elfie sending Roddy in on a standard surveillance mission...

==Gameplay==
The player's character is Roddy, a sixteen-year-old boy at the helm of an all-terrain combat vehicle, SOPHIA. The player pilots SOPHIA through a labyrinth of [[Wiktionary:3D|3D]] rooms in search of clues to the enemy's movements. Occasionally the player will encounter enemy installations or limiting topography that will force Roddy to leave Sophia, and advance on foot. As the game progresses, new equipment will be made available for SOPHIA, allowing access to new areas.

==Overview==
The gameplay is based primarily on using jumps and maneuvering to traverse obstacles while simultaneously battling foes. Since the player is punished implicitly for missing jumps over bottomless pits this game can be considered within the genre of 3D [[Platform game|platformers]]. The camera follows the SOPHIA's viewing angle when in the vehicle, but having dismounted, the camera must be controlled manually by the player. Targeting while running may therefore be seen by some as difficult because of the combination of having to adjust the camera pan angle manually. This difficulty can be exacerbated by the fact that when the player chooses to move laterally from the angle the character is facing, strafing is done literally by jumping. This means that once the player has committed to dodging in a certain direction, it cannot be changed. Unlike SOPHIA, the player cannot initiate a lateral dodge movement after leaving the ground. The graphics are typical of the 32-bit gaming era, and models are original and varied. The game has a load sequence between each room or when transferring Roddy back to SOPHIA when on foot. Load times can be shortened if playing on a PS2 by changing the disc speed on the PS driver from within the PlayStation [[BIOS]]. Sound effects tend to be recycled throughout the game, and each level has its own background theme music.

==Enemies==
Bosses are large creatures with separate health gauges for their various limbs, components, or parts. Bosses will be encountered both while driving Sophia and while exploring outside the vehicle.

'''Border Morris''' is a collection of individual local dances from villages along the English side of the [[Wales]]–[[England]] border in the counties of [[Herefordshire]], [[Worcestershire]] and [[Shropshire]]. They are part of the [[Morris dance]] tradition.

== History ==
[[Image:SilurianMorris.jpg|thumb|Silurian Border Morris Men, Church Lane, [[Ledbury]], Boxing Day 1997]]
This was a village dance done in winter for fun and a bit of money. It usually includes three to twelve dancers.

Some of the earliest accounts of a border morris tradition are provided by [[E.C. Cawte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  |ref=harv
  |title=The Morris Dance in Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire
  |last=Cawte  |first=E.C.
  |journal=Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society
  |volume=9  |issue=4
  |year=1963
  |pages=197–212
  |jstor=4521671
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is reference to questions about "any disguised persons, as morice dancers, maskers, or mum'ers" to [[St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury|St. Mary's Parish Church]] in [[Shrewsbury]] in 1584 and an amazing account of morris dancers at [[Hereford Racecourse|Hereford races]] in 1609, describing "two musicians, four whifflers, and twelve dancers, including hobby horse and maid marian", all from villages within 14 miles of Hereford.  The account claimed, "Hereford-shire for a morris-daunce puts downe, not onely all Kent, but verie neare (if one had line enough to measure it) three quarters of Christendome".

Cawte quotes further accounts describing complaints to the local magistrates about disruptive morris dancers in [[Longdon, Worcestershire|Longdon]], disrupting the [[Sabbath day]] from 1614 to 1617 and another account of dancers in [[Much Wenlock]] in 1652, causing a disturbance in an [[ale house]] at Nordley.  Later records from Shrewsbury mention payment to the "Bedlam Morris" in 1688 and 1689.

The dance depends on the numbers available, as at [[Brimfield, Herefordshire|Brimfield]]. The dances collected from a particular place sometimes differ quite markedly between informants, as at [[White Ladies Aston]], reflecting the flexibility from year to year. Sometimes a gang would only have one dance, sometimes two, or as at [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]] and [[Pershore]] an indeterminate set of [[dance figure|figure]]s.

[[File:Widders with sticks, Chepstow Apple Day 2013.jpg|thumb|Widders with short sticks]]
The common features are the rather short sticks and sometimes a stick and handkerchief version of the same dance, also usually a high single step akin to the local country dance step. Such detail as starting foot rules and phrase endings are notable for their apparent absence.   

Some of these village sides blackened their faces.  There is no record of any sides dancing together.  A few – both [[Upton-on-Severn|Upton-upon-Severn]] dances for example – matched the complexity of [[Cotswolds]] Morris, but many – e.g. [[Bromsberrow Heath]] – had a stark simplicity of one figure and one chorus repeated forever.&lt;ref&gt;Details of the collected dances can be found in [[Roy Dommett]]'s [http://www.opread.force9.co.uk/RoyDommet/BorderNotes/border.htm ''Source Material for the Border Morris Tradition'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, E.C. Cawte, the folklorist, proposed that these dances from the English side of the Welsh borders – Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire – constituted a Welsh border tradition.{{sfn|Cawte|1963}}

[[File:Music for the Widders, Chepstow Apple Day 2013.jpg|thumb|Music for The Widders]]
Since the 1960s and with further collecting in the 1970s by people such as Dave Jones (late of [[Silures|Silurian]] Morris, founded 1969, and later the Not For Joes)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Roots of Welsh Border Morris|last=Jones|first=Dave|year=1988|isbn=0 9526285 0 3|publisher=Annie Jones|location=Putley, Herefordshire}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Keith Francis (of Silurian Morris) a distinctive border morris style has grown. The tradition is characterised by [[blackface|black faces]], tattered shirts or coats, lots of stick-clashing and a big band traditionally comprising [[Melodeon (accordion)|melodeon]]s, [[fiddle]]s, [[concertina]]s, [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]] and [[tambourine]]s, although they now often also feature a [[tuba]] or [[sousaphone]], and [[flute]] or [[oboe]].

Under the guidance of Dave Jones and Keith Francis, Silurian Border Morris sought to interpret the collected dance material, preserving as much of the traditional styles and features as can be deduced. By contrast, in 1975, [[John Kirkpatrick (musician)|John Kirkpatrick]] created a new border tradition with the Shropshire Bedlams, which seeks to capture the spirit of the border sides, but not recreate any specific tradition or dance. Their dances feature much "whooping" and this has become characteristic amongst many other border sides.  Perhaps in keeping with the original tradition, the Original Welsh Border Morris (founded 1973) meet only once a year, at Christmas, and dance the traditional dances of Herefordshire and Worcestershire. With many of the newer sides, the dances have often become complex, involving many invented and evolved steps, figures and choruses.

Many dances were collected by [[Cecil Sharp]] and later collectors, and several were included in Bacon's book,&lt;ref name="bacon" &gt;Bacon, Lionel 1974 ''A Handbook of Morris Dances''. Published by The Morris Ring&lt;/ref&gt; but border morris was largely neglected by revival morris sides until late in the 20th century. The Silurian Morris Men of Ledbury, Herefordshire, included border dances in performances from the early 1970s and changed exclusively to border morris in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = History | url =http://www.silurianmorris.org.uk/history.html| publisher = Silurian Border Morris Men| accessdate = 2006-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Shropshire Bedlams were founded in 1975;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kirkpatrick| first = John| title = Bordering On the Insane| journal = English Dance and Song | volume = 41| pages = 12–14 | year = 1979| issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; both became pioneers of a resurgence of border morris among revival sides in the following decades.

The Leominster Morris&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About us|url=http://www.leominstermorris.org|publisher=Leominster Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt; were reformed in 1988, split from The Breinton Morris (who disbanded after a further 10 years) and made contact with one of the musicians from the previous side from the 1930s, Tom Postons. His recollections of the dancing of the time as having "lots of bowing, hat-raising, and clashing of sticks on the ground" led to the "revival" of Postons' stick dance. Cecil Sharp visited the town on 27 December 1909 with local folklorist [[Ella Mary Leather]], and collected tunes from the prolific local gypsy fiddler John Locke. The Leominster men use several of Locke's tunes in their repertoire today.

Border morris dancing was different on the Welsh side of the border, and a team on the Welsh side was formed in 1992. Initially the side was named Morys ar y Clwt but it was changed to Carreg-las in 1997. They use traditional Welsh and English folk and morris dance tunes. ''Carreg-las'' translates from the Welsh as '[[bluestone]]', a rock found locally in the [[Preseli Mountains]], of which it is said [[Stonehenge]] was constructed.

==Theories of origins of blackface==
[[Image:Welsh border morris men.jpg|thumb|Welsh border morris men]]
The origins of the [[blackface]] are much debated and remain unclear.  However, various theories exist, and these are discussed below.

===15th-century Moorish mimicry===
[[Image:Moreska Grasser06.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A small statue of a "Moriskentänzer" made by [[Erasmus Grasser]] in 1480 for Old Townhall in [[Munich]], one of a set of 16, of which only 10 remain. This dancer has an appearance which would be described at the time as "[[Moors|moorish]]", but all [[commons:Category:Moreska dancers (Grasser)|the other 9 surviving carvings]] are fairer-skinned. All wear bells on their legs.]]
The term ''morris'' is believed to be from the late [[Middle English]] word ''morys'', a variant of the word ''[[moorish]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/morris%2Bdance|title=Definition of Morris Dance}}&lt;/ref&gt; – from the [[Moors]] of [[Morocco]]; this explanation was cited as early as 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England|last=Strutt|first=Joseph|year=1801|publisher=Methuen &amp; Co.|location=London|url=https://archive.org/stream/sportspastimesof00struuoft#page/n7/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carved figures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muenchner-stadtmuseum.de/muenchner-stadtmuseum/highlights/grassermohr.html |title=Die Moriskentänzer- Dauerausstellung|publisher=Stadtmuseum-online.de |date= |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1480 in Munich, Germany, show "Moriskentänzer" with bells, including one of the ten extant having African features. Later evidence from France includes this quote from [[Thoinot Arbeau]] circa 1580: "In fashionable society when I was young, a small boy, his face daubed with black and his forehead swathed in a white or yellow handkerchief, would make an appearance after supper. He wore leggings covered with little bells and performed a morris".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imslp.org/wiki/Orch%C3%A9sographie_(Arbeau,_Thoinot)|accessdate=1 March 2013|title=Orchésographie (Arbeau, Thoinot)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the precise linkage between the morris in France and England at that time remains unclear. [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] may have become familiar with French morris during his time in France, and is recorded as having morris at his own court in England (see below).

Another theory is that the blackface tradition derives from earlier forms of the dance involving a Moroccan king and his followers. There is recorded evidence from 1688 of payments in [[Shrewsbury]] of 10 shillings to "Ye Bedlam Morris" and 2 shillings for "Ye King of Morocco".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashman|first=Gordon|url=http://www.americanmorrisnews.org/pastissues/april2005v25n1/current_issue/gordonashmanv25n1bordermorrisrootsandrevival.html |title=Border Morris: Roots &amp; Revival (Transcript of Talk) |publisher=American Morris Newsletter |date=April 2005 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of the 18th-century association of black faces with morris is given by the description of the [[Betley Window]] (a stained-glass window in Betley Hall, Staffordshire, from around 1621, depicting morris dancers) by its owner, George Tollet (1725–1779). Writing in 1778, he states "we are authorised ... to call some of the representations on my window, Morris Dancers, though I am uncertain whether it exhibits one Moorish personage, as none of them have black or tawny faces, nor do they brandish swords or staves in their hands, nor are they, in their shirts adorned with ribbons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Some Notes on the History of the Betley Window|last=Nicol|first=E.J.|year=1953|volume=7|issue=2|journal=Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallop (1934)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Origins of the Morris Dance|last=Gallop|first=Rodney|journal=Journal of the English Folk and Dance Society|volume=1|issue=3|pages=122–129|year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; questions the Moorish link, quoting both Douce and [[Cecil Sharp]] who felt the English dance was too dissimilar in style and appearance to be derived from the continental European Moorish dances believed to be of Moorish origin. Sharp himself appears to have changed his view between 1906, when he saw a link between the black faces of English morris and the dancers on the Franco–Spanish border, and 1912, when he viewed the dance to be a pan-European custom possibly corrupted by Moorish influence. He argued that the name ''Moorish'' was used as a description of an existing earlier tradition, not because the dancers represented Moors. Gallop goes on to examine the linkage between the English morris dance and the ''mouriscada'' or ''[[morisca]]'' dances of Spain and Portugal, which involve ritual, choreographed battles between the Christians and Moors or Turks, often to music, involving swords and handkerchiefs. Gallop asks whether the Christian–Moorish link is actually a later interpretation of earlier pagan mock battles between Summer and Winter, such as that fought on [[May Day]] on the [[Isle of Man]] between the Queens of Summer and Winter. He argues that in parts of Portugal and the Basque Country, the word ''moor'' is also used to mean 'pagan', and that perhaps ''morris dance'' originally meant 'pagan dance', and that bells and disguised faces are a common feature of pagan ritual. Thus, for Gallop, the Moorish link is coincidental and the true origins are much older and pagan. This view remains popular for many today.

===Disguise===

Blackface and disguise, often in a pagan themed context have their own history which intersects with morris tradition. There is evidence from the 1450s onward of the blackening of faces with charcoal as a means to evade identification, and in association with pagan themes. In the Kent and Essex enclosure riots of 1450–51 men cross-dressed as '[[Fairy Queen|Queen of the Fairies]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (similar to the related [[Diana (mythology)|Doamna Zînelor]], of the [[Călușari]]) including those wearing blackface.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An event which took place in the autumn of 1450 illustrates well the way in which the often separate activities of poaching and protest could on occasion conflate. On October 1450 a large group of men entered the duke of Buckingham's park at Penshurst in Kent and carried off eighty-two deer. Thirty-two men, nineteen of them yeomen, were named in subsequent indictment which made clear that a good number had escaped by its claim that there had been a total of a hundred present (not a figure to be taken too literally). These armed men had charcoaled faces, wore long false beards and withheld their names, calling themselves servants of the Queen of the Fairies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Rebels' Proclamation of 1489 following on the Black Act a few years prior, provides another contemporary example of disguise in British folk tradition.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In a letter of May 1489 to his brother [[John Paston (died 1504)|John Paston III]], William Paston III included a copy of the proclamation issued by the rebels shortly after the murder of the earl of Northumberland. Addressing the 'Northe partys of England', this proclamation summoned 'euery lorde, knyght, esquyer, gentylman, and yeman' to array themselves 'for to geynsstonde suche persons as is abowtward for to dystroy owre suffereyn lorde the Kynge and the Comowns of Engelond for suche vnlawfull poyntys as [[Thomas Becket|Synt Thomas of Cauntyrbery]] dyed for'. Becket could have been invoked because of his reputed championing of the interests of the poor, or because of his defence of ecclesiastical privileges. Such interpretations assume that 'vnlawfull' was a hostile interpolation made by William of Paston or his source, yet Becket's martyrdom was universally admired: a more conventional invocation of Becket during the protests in Kent in 1496 paired him with [[Saint George|St George]]. Moreover, the proclamation was issued in the name of a local hobgoblin, 'Mayster [[Hob (folklore)|Hobbe]] Hyrste,&lt;ref&gt;[http://etymonline.com/?term=hurst&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 hurst] (n.) "hillock" (especially a sandy one), also "grove, wooded eminence," from Old English hyrst "hillock, wooded eminence," from Proto-Germanic *hursti- (see [http://etymonline.com/?term=horst&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 horst]). Common in place names (such as Amherst).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
[http://etymonline.com/?term=horst&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 horst] (n.) 1893 in geology, from German Horst "mass, heap" (given its geological sense by Suess, 1883), from Old High German hurst "thicket," from Proto-Germanic *hursti-, from PIE *krsti- (source also of Middle Dutch horst "underwood," Old English hyrst "grove, wooded eminence"), from root *kert- "to turn, entwine" (see [http://etymonline.com/?term=hurdle&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 hurdle] (n.)).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
see: [http://etymonline.com/?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=hyrst http://etymonline.com/...hyrst]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Puck (mythology)|Robyn God-felaw]]s brodyr'. Protesters adopted such fictive personas not only to conceal identity but also perhaps to associate their grievances with Everyman and to invoke a popular culture of [[Lord of Misrule|misrule]]. Elsewhere we find a 'queen of the fairies' leading a rising and her 'servants' poaching; indeed, the first 'black act' against poaching when disguised passed in 1486.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Barbara Lowe's (1957) review of early records of the morris in England&lt;ref name="Lowe 1957 61–82"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Early Records of the Morris in England|last=Lowe|first=Barbara|year=1957|journal=Journal of the English Folk and Dance Society|volume=8|issue=2|pages=61–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; cites one of the earliest recorded mentions of the morris in England, with [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] paying "Master Wentworth £6 13s. 4d. 'towards the making of a disguising for a morysse'" in September 1501.  She goes on to describe later accounts of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s Shrovetide banquet for ambassadors in 1509, in which the torchbearers "were appareyled in crymosen satyne and grene lyke Moreskoes, their faces blacke".  The following year, in 1510, "there was a Pageant like a mountain, out of which came a Lady of Gold, and the children of honour called the Henchemen, which were freshly disguysed, and danced a Morice before the Kyng".

Lowe (1957) also quotes from ''The Booke of all maner of Orders concerning an Erles House'', dating from around 1510, which provides rules for "plays, interludes and disguisings, including Morrises" and states, "If a Morris is to be performed, it should take place after the disguising".  Thus the link to blackened faces, and between morris dance and disguise, is clearly established by the early 16th century, although the nature of that disguise is broader than simply a black face, and includes all manner of elaborate costumes.

E. C. Cawte's (1963) seminal work on morris dancing in Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire{{sfn|Cawte|1963}} quotes ''A History of Shrewsbury''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Owen|first1=H.|last2=Blakeway|first2=J. B.|authorlink1=Hugh Owen (topographer)|authorlink2=John Brickdale Blakeway|title=A History of Shrewsbury|year=1825|publisher=Harding, Lepard and Co.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the Visitation at St. Mary's Parish Church, Shrewsbury, in 1584, when it was asked, "Whether there have bene any lords of mysrule, or somer lords and ladies, or any disguised persons, as morice dancers, maskers or mumm'ers, or such lyke, within the parishe, ether in the nativititide or in som'er, or at any other tyme, and what be their names?" It is thus clear that in Shrewsbury, on the Welsh border, morris dancers were associated with disguise in the 16th century.

The explanation of disguise is also given for the blackface in the later periods, and that during the hard winters of the 17th and 18th century, out of work labourers and builders sought to anonymously supplement their income by a bit of dancing and begging.  The use of blackface as a form of disguise is established in early 18th-century England. In 1723 it became a capital offence under the [[Black Act|Waltham "Black Act"]] to appear "in disguise, either by mask or by blackened face".  Certainly by the 17th century, border morris seems to have degenerated into a source of public nuisance, as many of Lowe's (1957)&lt;ref name="Lowe 1957 61–82"/&gt; primary accounts recall.

Theresa Buckland's (1990) research details the linkages between the 19th-century Lancashire [[Britannia Coco-nut Dancers]] and minstrel shows, although it does not discuss any link to Welsh border morris.  She argued, "The 'disguise' function of the costume has most likely been influences by Cecil Sharp's [1911] interpretation of the black face [...] which has been repeated in various publications and ephemera of the English Folk Dance and Song Society ... The dancers have been exposed to information from these publications, whether first-hand or further removed." The argument of disguise is used to "explain away" the blackface, while the black faces of dancers have radically different symbolic potential than that of the faces of supposedly disguised labourers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buckland | first1 = Theresa Jill | last2 =  | first2 =  | year = 1990 | title = Black Faces, Garlands, and Coconuts: Exotic Dances on Street and Stage | journal = Dance Research Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–12 | publisher = Congress on Research on Dance | jstor = 1477779 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''American Morris News'' (2005), "It is most commonly thought that the origin and function of blackface in Morris dancing lies in primitive disguise rather than an imitation of black men. However, this is not definitely the case. Accounts of the Morris of Shakespeare's time make no mention of blackface, while the border teams contemporary with minstrel shows typically blacked up. American minstrel shows, if not the actual origin of blackface among Morris dancers, at least contributed to its popularity."&lt;ref name="Krause" /&gt;

Robert Hornback (2008) has a different viewpoint, comparing border morris to crude parodies of [[African dance|African tribal war dances]], and cites the blackface of Morris dancing as part of racist practices in Britain that predate American minstrelsy and, in fact, contribute to the minstrel tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hornback | first1 = R. | title = "Extravagant and Wheeling Strangers": Early Blackface Dancing Fools, Racial Impersonation, and the Limits of Identification | doi = 10.1179/175330708X311353 | journal = Exemplaria | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 197–222 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern interpretations===
[[File:Widders, Chepstow Apple Day.jpg|thumb|upright|The Widders dancing at [[Chepstow]] [[Apple Day]], 2013]]
Canadian academic Pauline Greenhill, commenting on morris dancing in Canada, writes that

{{Quote|text=[...] it seems unlikely that North American audiences, who encounter Morris at dance-outs at local shopping centres, pubs, and so on, far from geographical associations with coal miners, would see in blackface dances anything other than a white peoples' representation of black culture. Unfamiliar with the localised and historicised explanations of Morris tradition used by dancers, audiences might historically contextualise blackface in terms of entertainment forms such as vaudeville and view it in light of the overtly or covertly racist ideas associated with these practices. Or they might locate it in a slightly more up-to-date scenario of riots and gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfmb.icaap.org/content/28.3/BV28-3art4.pdf |title=On the Whiteness of Morris: An Illumination of Canadian Folklore}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}


In an ethnographic study of Morris dancing, Greenhill states that the blackface practices of other English dances "only underscores the colonial complicity of Morris, particularly for non-English, nonwhite audiences." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenhill | first1 = Pauline | last2 =  | first2 =  | year = 2002 | title = Folk and Academic Racism: Concepts from Morris and Folklore | journal = Journal of American Folklore | volume = 115 | issue = 456 | pages = 226–246 | publisher = American Folklore Society | jstor = 4129221 | doi = 10.2307/4129221 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the interpretation of the blackface changed over the centuries – from Moroccan mimicry, to disguise, to a minstrel-inspired costume and back to disguise. To avoid controversy, some modern sides wear masks or colour their faces in different colours in order to appease the offended.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8904">'''Canzone napoletana''' ({{IPA-it|kanˈtsoːne napoleˈtaːna|pron}}), sometimes referred to as '''Neapolitan song''' ({{lang-nap|canzona napulitana}} {{IPA-nap|kanˈdzoːnə napuliˈtɑːnə|}}), is a generic term for a traditional form of music sung in the [[Neapolitan language]], ordinarily for the male voice singing solo, although well represented by female soloists as well, and expressed in familiar genres such as the lover's complaint or the [[serenade]].  It consists of a large body of composed popular music—such songs as "[['O sole mio]]"; "[[Torna a Surriento]]"; "[[Funiculì, Funiculà]]"; "[[Santa Lucia]]" and others.

The Neapolitan song became a formal institution in the 1830s due to an annual song-writing competition for the Festival of [[Piedigrotta]], dedicated to the Madonna of Piedigrotta, a well-known church in the [[Mergellina]] area of Naples. The winner of the first festival was a song entitled ''Te voglio bene assaie''; it is traditionally attributed to the prominent opera composer [[Gaetano Donizetti]], although an article published in 1984 by Marcello Sorce Keller shows there is no historical evidence in support of the attribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Marcello |last=Sorce Keller |title=''Io te voglio bene assaje'': A Famous Neapolitan Song Traditionally Attributed to Gaetano Donizetti |journal=The Music Review |volume=XLV |date=1984 |number=3-4 |pages=251-264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival ran regularly until 1950, when it was abandoned. A subsequent [[Festival of Neapolitan Song]] on Italian state radio enjoyed some success in the 1950s but was eventually abandoned as well.

The period since 1950 has produced such songs as ''Malafemmena'' by [[Totò]], ''Maruzzella'' by [[Renato Carosone]], ''Indifferentemente'' by [[Mario Trevi]] and ''Carmela'' by [[Sergio Bruni]].  Although separated by some decades from the earlier classics of this genre, they have now become Neapolitan "classics" in their own right.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:canznap01.jpg|right|thumb|Murolo's authoritative recorded anthology of Neapolitan music.]] --&gt;
Many of the Neapolitan songs are world-famous because they were taken abroad by [[Italian diaspora|emigrants]] from Naples and southern Italy roughly between 1880 and 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Italian birds of passage:the diaspora of Neapolitan musicians in New York|last=Frasca|first=Simona|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=9781137322418|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music also was popularized abroad by performers such as [[Enrico Caruso]], who took to singing the popular music of his native city as encores at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York in the early 1900s. Caruso also recorded many of these songs, which subsequently became part of the standard repertoire for operatic tenors, and which were performed and recorded by such notable singers as [[Beniamino Gigli|Beniamino Gigli,]] [[Francesco Albanese]], [[Franco Corelli]], [[Mario Del Monaco]], [[Giuseppe Di Stefano]], and [[Tito Schipa]].   [[The Three Tenors]]  also performed popular songs from Naples. [[Plácido Domingo ]]recorded a full CD ''[[Italia ti amo]]'' of traditional and some more modern Neapolitan and Italian songs. [[Luciano Pavarotti]] recorded three albums of Neapolitan and Italian songs: ''The Best: Disc 2'', (2005), ''Pavarotti Songbook'', (1991), and ''[[Romantica (Pavarotti album)|Romantica]]'', (2002). [[Mario Lanza]] recorded an acclaimed selection of 12 Neapolitan songs on his 1959 album, ''[[Mario! Lanza At His Best]]''. Opera/Pop crossover tenor, [[Sergio Franchi]] recorded his very popular ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top 25 RCA debut album, ''Romantic Italian Songs'' in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allrovi.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014094317/http://www.allrovi.com/ |date=2011-10-14 }} Sergio Franchi&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to record Neapolitan songs on most of his albums throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;http.www.discogs.com Sergio Franchi&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Bocelli]] recorded an album in 2009 dedicated to the style, entitled ''[[Incanto]]''.

The most important native Neapolitan performers of Neapolitan songs in the last few decades include  [[Roberto Murolo]], [[Bruno Venturinni|Bruno Venturini]], [[Mario Trevi]], [[Mario Abbate]], [[Mario Merola (singer)|Mario Merola]], [[Giulietta Sacco]], [[Franco Ricci]], [[Sergio Bruni]], [[Renato Carosone]], and [[Mario Maglione]]. Murolo is known not only as a singer and guitarist, but also as a composer, scholar and collector of the music; his collection of twelve [[gramophone record|LP]]s, released in the 1960s, is an annotated compendium of Neapolitan song dating back to the twelfth century. Representatives of different veins, but nevertheless leading the continuing tradition of song in Neapolitan, are the jazz-rock singer-songwriter [[Pino Daniele]] and the folkloric group [[Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An important factor in defining what makes a Neapolitan song is the matter of language. All these songs are written and performed in the [[Neapolitan language]] (Napoletano). . Although the music is sung by many non-Neapolitan singers, it is difficult to sing correctly without knowledge of the Neapolitan dialect, which is crucial in obtaining the correct inflection.The matter of dialect has not prevented a few non-Neapolitans from writing dialect versions of Neapolitan songs. The most famous example of this is ''[['A vucchella]]'' by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].

'''María Isabel Carlota Jaramillo''', stage name '''Carlota Jaramillo''' (9 July 1904 – 10 December 1987) was an [[Ecuador]]ian ''[[pasillo]]'' singer, known as "''La Reina de la Canción Nacional''" (Queen of National Song).

==Early life==
Jaramillo was born in Calacalí, in 1904. Her parents, Isaac Jaramillo Jaramillo and Natalia Jaramillo, were farmers. She grew in a musical family, one of her uncles and her maternal grandfather were musicians. Carlota studied in her hometown primary school and attended the “Manuela Cañizares” [[normal school]] in Quito to graduate as a teacher.

==Career==
In 1922 Jaramillo and her sister won a song contest at the Teatro Sucre in Quito. They were the only women in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eluniverso.com/2004/07/06/0001/259/842B2FF452B343E7822F178144E03ABE.html|title=Carlota Jaramillo, la reina del pasillo ecuatoriano - JUL. 06, 2004 - Música - Historicos - EL UNIVERSO|last=eluniverso.com.|website=www.eluniverso.com|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that Jaramillo followed the musical career. She recorded her first disc in 1938, the pasillo ''Amor Grande y Lejano. In 1942 ''she recorded with Luis Alberto Valencia'', Sendas Distintas'', composed by her husband, Jorge Araujo Chiriboga.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elcomercio.com/tendencias/sendas-distintas-historia-amor.html|title=Sendas Distintas, la historia de amor de la Reina del Pasillo|website=El Comercio|language=es-LA|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hit songs by her include ''La ingratitud'', ''Sombras'', ''Honda pena'', and ''Para mi tus recuerdos.''

== Death and homages ==
Jaramillo died on 10 December 1987 of cerebral traumatisms after a fall in her home. She got a funeral with full honors from the Ecuatorian society. A monument in her honor was built in Calacalí in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diccionariobiograficoecuador.com/tomos/tomo23/j1.htm Pérez Pimentel, Rodolfo, «Carlota Jaramillo de Araujo», ''Diccionario Biográfico del Ecuador'', acceso 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Her house was transformed into a museum in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elcomercio.com/actualidad/quito/calacali-hay-museo-carlota-jaramillo.html|title=En Calacalí hay un museo sobre Carlota Jaramillo|website=El Comercio|language=es-LA|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Casino tokens''' (also known as casino or gaming '''chips''', '''checks''', or '''cheques''') are small discs used in lieu of [[currency]] in [[casino]]s. Colored metal, injection-molded [[plastic]] or compression molded [[clay]] tokens of various denominations are used primarily in table games, as opposed to metal [[token coin]]s, used primarily in [[slot machine]]s.  Casino tokens are also widely used as [[play money]] in casual or tournament games.

Some casinos also use rectangular '''gaming plaques''' for high-stakes table games ($25,000 and above). Plaques differ from chips in that they are larger, usually rectangular in shape and contain [[serial number]]s.

==Use==

Money is exchanged for tokens in a casino at the casino cage, at the gaming tables, or at a cashier station. The tokens are interchangeable with money at the casino. They generally have no value outside of the casino, but certain businesses (such as taxis or waiters—especially for tips) in gambling towns may honor them informally.

Tokens are employed for several reasons.  Because of the uniform size, shape, and patterns of stacks of chips, they are easier to tally compared to currency. This attribute also enables the [[pit boss]] or security to quickly verify the amount being paid, reducing the chance that a dealer might incorrectly pay a customer. The uniform weight of the casino's official tokens allows them to weigh great stacks or heaps of chips rather than tally them (though aids such as chip trays are far more common.) Furthermore, it is observed that consumers gamble more freely with replacement currencies than with cash.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} A more pragmatic reason for casinos using chips in place of cash at table games is to discourage players from grabbing back their bet and attempting to flee should their bet not win, because chips, unlike cash, must be redeemed at the casino cashier and have no value outside the casino in question. Lastly, the chips are considered to be an integral part of the casino environment, and replacing them with some alternate currency would be unpopular{{dubious|date=October 2018}}.

Many casinos have eliminated the use of metal tokens (and coins) in their slot machines, in favor of paper receipts or pre-paid cards, which, while requiring heavy infrastructure costs to install, eliminate the coin handling expenses, jamming problems encountered in machines which took coins or tokens and can allow more game-specific technology in the space of a machine which would usually be dedicated to coin mechanisms. While some casinos (such as the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas) which installed the receipt system had kept the $1 tokens around for use as $1 chips, most other casinos using the receipts had simply scrapped the tokens entirely. Most casinos using receipts have automated machines at which customers may redeem receipts, eliminating the need for coin counting windows and decreasing labor costs.

[[Casino chip collecting]] is a part of [[numismatics]], more specifically as specialized [[exonumia]] collecting. This hobby has become increasingly popular with the Casino Chips &amp; Gaming Tokens Collectors Club formed in 1988. Some collectors may value certain casino tokens up to $100,000, which are typically traded on online auction websites like [[eBay]]. Several casinos sell custom-made sets of chips and one or two decks of cards stamped with the name of the casino on them. Each set is contained in a small briefcase or box.

==History==
The ancestors of the modern casino token were the counters used to keep score in the card games [[Ombre]] and [[Quadrille (card game)|Quadrille]]. In 1752, French Quadrille sets contained a number of different counters, known as ''jetons'', ''fiches'' and ''mils''. Unlike modern poker chips, they were colored differently only to determine player ownership for purposes of settling payments at the end of the game, with different denominations differentiated by different shapes that each counter type had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlettgames.uk/histocs/quadrill.html|title=Quadrille and Médiateur: Courtly ladies' game of 18th-century France|author=[[David Parlett]]|accessdate=28 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early history of Poker during the 19th century, players seemed to use any small valuable object imaginable. Early poker players sometimes used jagged gold pieces, gold nuggets, gold dust, or coins as well as "chips" primarily made of ivory, bone, wood, paper, and a composition made from clay and shellac. Several companies between the 1880s and the late 1930s made clay composition poker chips. There were over 1000 designs from which to choose. Most chips were white, red, blue, and yellow, but they could be made in almost any color desired.

The vast majority of authentic casino chips are "clay" chips but can be more accurately described as compression molded chips. Contrary to popular belief, no gaming chip going as far back as the 1950s has been 100% clay. Modern clay chips are a composition of materials more durable than clay alone. At least some percentage of the chips is of an earthen material such as sand, chalk, and clay similar to that found in [[cat litter]]. The process used to make these chips is a [[trade secret]], and varies slightly by manufacturer, most being relatively expensive and time-consuming per chip. The edge spots, or inserts, are not painted on; to achieve this effect, this area of the clay is removed and then replaced with clay of a different color; this can be done to each chip individually or a strip can be taken out of a cylindrical block of material and replaced with the alternate color before the block is cut into chips. Then each chip receives a mid-inlay if desired, and is placed in a special mold that heats and compresses the chip at approximately 10,000 [[pounds per square inch|psi]] (70 [[pascal (unit)|MPa]]) at {{convert|300|°F|°C|-1|abbr=on}}, hence the term compression molded chips.

The printed graphics on clay chips is called an inlay. Inlays are typically made of paper and are then clad with a plastic film applied to the chip prior to the compression molding process. During the molding process the inlay becomes permanently fastened to the chip and can not be removed from the chip without destroying the inlay.

Ceramic chips were introduced in the mid 1980s as alternative to clay chips, and are also used in casinos, as well as being readily available to the home market. The ability to print lettering and graphics on the entire surface of the chip, instead of just the inlay, made them popular. Ceramic chips are sometimes also referred to as clay or clay composite, but they are in fact an injection-molded chip made with a special plastic or resin formula that approximates the feel and sound of ceramic or porcelain. There are less expensive chips for the home market, made from various forms of plastic and plastic covered metal slugs as well.

The chips used in North American casinos typically weigh about 10&amp;nbsp;grams, but are usually between 8 and 10.5&amp;nbsp;g. Companies that manufacture chips for actual casinos include Gaming Partners International (whose subdivisions include Paulson, Bud Jones, and B&amp;G), Classic Poker Chips, Palm Gaming International, Game On Chip Company and GTI Gaming.

===Colors===
{{Reduce trivia|section|date=October 2018}}
There is no universally standardized color scheme for poker chip values, and schemes not only vary nationally and regionally, but even from venue to venue, or by event type within a single venue.

[[File:Poker chips.jpg|thumb|right|A standard 300 piece set of Plastic Injection chips often sold as "clay composite" chips.]]
[[File:Set of Poker Chips in Case.jpg|thumb|A set of injection molded [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] poker chips "hot-stamped" with denominations 100, 50, 25, &amp; 10.]]
Chip colors found in home sets typically include red, white, blue, and sometimes green and black; however, more recently a wide assortment of colors have become readily available, particularly in lower-cost ABS plastic chips. Common additional colors are pink, purple, yellow, orange, and grey. Newer designs in home chips include three-color designs where a three-step molding process creates a chip with unique base, secondary, and detail colors. As chip sets are tailored to the buyer, the values of various colors vary widely, with less traditional colors either used as very high values such as $500, $1000, $5000, and so forth, common in tournaments, or as special "fractional" values such as $2 or $0.50, common in low-limit games.

In casinos, uniform chip colors and sizes are sometimes specified by the local [[gaming control board]] for consistency. For example, regulations in [[New Jersey]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.nj.us/casinos/actreg/reg/chapter_46.html Chapter 46: Gaming Equipment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514053525/http://www.state.nj.us/casinos/actreg/reg/chapter_46.html |date=May 14, 2007 }}, [[New Jersey Casino Control Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Illinois]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igb.illinois.gov/regs/3000.625.pdf Chip specifications]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Illinois Gaming Board Regulations&lt;/ref&gt; specify similar uniform colors. Notably, Nevada has no regulations regarding color, which is why Nevada casinos may use white, blue, or gray as $1, though $5 and greater are almost always consistently colored. All US states where gambling is legal require that casino chips have a unique combination of edge spots for identification, the name and location of the casino and the chip's value, if any, impressed, printed, or molded onto the obverse and reverse of the token.

In 19th-century America, there was enough of a tradition of using blue chips for higher values that "blue chip" in noun and adjective [[word sense|senses]] signaling high-value chips and high-value property are attested since 1873 and 1894, respectively.&lt;ref name="MWU"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This established [[connotation]] was first extended to the sense of a [[blue chip (stock market)|blue-chip stock]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

$2.50 chips (colloquially referred to as "snappers" by chip collectors) are mostly used for [[blackjack]] tables, since a "natural" (a 21 on the first two cards dealt to a player) typically pays 3:2 and most wagers are in increments of $5. However, the [[Tropicana Casino Resort Atlantic City|Tropicana Casino]] and [[Borgata]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], and others, have used $2.50 (pink) chips in $7.50 to $15 and $10 to $20 poker games.

$20 chips are used mostly at [[Baccarat (card game)|baccarat]] and [[pai gow poker]] because a 5% commission charged for all winning banker wagers at baccarat and winning wagers at pai gow converts evenly. Bets of $20 are not uncommon in traditional table games such as [[craps]] and [[roulette]]; a $20 chip, for example, places a $5 bet on each of the "hard ways" in craps and is preferable to passing a stack of chips or making change.

Because eight is considered a [[lucky number]] in Chinese culture, chips denominated 8, 88, and 888 (e.g., $8 in the US) are common in casinos catering to a Chinese clientele, often as a promotion for the Chinese Lunar New Year. They will sometimes contain an image of the animal associated with the year and are issued in a variety of colors.

Low-denomination yellow chips vary in value: $20 in Atlantic City and Illinois (which also uses "mustard yellow" $0.50 chips); $5 at most [[Southern California]] poker rooms; $2 at [[Foxwoods Resort Casino|Foxwoods]]' poker room in [[Ledyard, Connecticut]]; [[Running Aces Harness Park]] and [[Canterbury Park]], both in [[Minnesota]]; and at Casino del Sol in [[Tucson, Arizona]]; and $0.50 at [[Potawatomi Casino]] in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. Blue chips are occasionally used for $10, most notably in Atlantic City. In Las Vegas and [[California]], most casinos use blue or white for $1 chips, though many Las Vegas casinos now use $1 metal tokens in lieu of chips.

Chips are also available in denominations of $1000 or more, depending on the wagering limits of the casino. Such chips are often yellow or orange.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}. Casinos in Nevada, Atlantic City, and other areas that permit high wagers typically have chips available in $5000, $10,000, $25,000, and more; the colors for these vary widely.

Denominations above $5000 are almost never encountered by the general public; their use is usually limited to "high limit rooms" where bet sizes are much greater than on the main floor. Casinos often use gaming plaques for these denominations: These plaques are about the size of a playing card, and must be marked with [[serial number]]s. The greatest value placed on a plaque to date is $10 million, used at the London Club in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/the-london-clubs-$10-million-gaming-%60plaque-raises-the-bar-for-las-vegas-127220 |work=Business Wire |title=The London Club's $10 Million Gaming 'Plaque' Raises the Bar for Las Vegas |date=2000-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010230736/http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/the-london-clubs-%2410-million-gaming-%60plaque-raises-the-bar-for-las-vegas-127220 |archivedate=October 10, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Televised poker tournaments and cash games sometimes use bundled [[United States dollar|paper bills]] for high denominations, though the [[World Series of Poker]] and the [[World Poker Tour]] use round chips exclusively with denominations up to $250,000; tournament chips, however, are not redeemable for cash.

European casinos use a similar scheme, though certain venues, such as the [[Aviation Club de France]], use pink for €2 and blue for €10. European casinos also use plaques rather than chips for high denominations, usually in the €1000 and higher range.

===Security===
Each casino has a unique set of chips, even if the casino is part of a greater company. This distinguishes a casino's chips from others, since each chip and token on the gaming floor has to be backed up with the appropriate amount of cash. In addition, with the exception of Nevada, casinos are not permitted to honor another casino's chips.

The security features of casino chips are numerous. Artwork is of a very high resolution or of photographic quality. Custom color combinations on the chip edge (edge spots) are usually distinctive to a particular casino. UV markings can be made on the inlay. Certain chips incorporate [[RFID]] technology, such as those at the [[Wynn Casino]] in Las Vegas. Also, makers' marks are difficult to reproduce. Also being used by one manufacturer, Palm Gaming, is an audible taggant incorporated into the ceramic chip blank.  A simple handheld reader will beep if the gaming chip is authentic. Palm Gaming is even manufacturing custom made molds for their ceramic gaming chips- adding yet another high level of security to its gaming chip.

Counterfeit chips are rare. High levels of surveillance, along with staff familiarity with chip design and coloring, make passing fake chips difficult. Casinos, though, are prepared for this situation. All states require that casinos have a set of chips in reserve with alternate markings,{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} though they may not be required to have  exactly the same number of reserve chips as they do on the floor.  The most notable instance of counterfeiting chips was broken up in 2005, when two men were caught falsely converting $1 chips into higher denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegastripping.com/news/blog/384/counterfeit-chip-ring-broken-up-in-vegas|title=Counterfeit Chip Ring Broken Up in Vegas|publisher=''Vegas Tripping''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casino chips used in [[tournament]]s are usually much cheaper and of much simpler design. Because the chips have no cash value, usually chips are designed with a single color (usually differing in shade or tone from the version on the casino floor), a smaller breadth, and a basic mark on the interior to distinguish denominations; however, at certain events (such as the [[World Series of Poker]] or other televised poker), chips approach quality levels of chips on the floor.

==Variations==
Several casinos, such as the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock Hotel and Casino]] in Las Vegas, issue "limited edition" varied-designed chips, commemorating various events, though retaining a common color scheme. This encourages customers to keep them for souvenirs, at a profit to the casino.

In certain casinos, such as the [[Wynn Las Vegas|Wynn]] and [[Encore Las Vegas|Encore]] Casinos in Las Vegas, chips are embedded with [[RFID]] tags to help casinos keep better track of them, determine gamblers' average bet sizes, and to make them harder for counterfeiters to reproduce. However, this technique is costly and considered by many to be unnecessary to profit. Also, this technology provides minimal benefits in games with layouts that do not provide gamblers with their own designated betting areas, such as [[craps]].

==In television==
The first game show to use them, ''[[Duel (U.S. game show)|Duel]]'', had a variation in which the contestants answer questions using oversized casino tokens. The [[World Series of Poker]] at one time actually used its casino tokens for the poker tournaments, but in more recent years has had special Paulson [[World Series of Poker|WSOP]] clay sets made for the tournaments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2621">'''Christian comedy''' is a subgenre of [[comedy]] where the material presented is aimed towards a Christian audience. The performances are typically held on church grounds or at off-site, church-sponsored venues.

The material often contains Christian references, although this is not a requirement. Recently, notable performers like [[Victoria Jackson]], [[Tim Conway]], [[Sinbad (entertainer)|Sinbad]] and [[Patricia Heaton]] have appeared on a DVD series for the Christian market entitled, "Thou Shalt Laugh"&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoushaltlaugh.com/ Thou Shalt Laugh] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223151828/http://www.thoushaltlaugh.com/ |date=2007-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian comedy is increasingly being used as an [[outreach]], with the idea that a comedy show is a great way to bring people into church who may have never thought about coming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larryweaver.com/entertainment/christian-comedians.asp Christian Comedians]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian comedy is also used as a method to renew and refresh the spirit of church members, based on the Bible passage that says laughter does a heart good, like medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiancomedyacts.com Christian Comedy Acts]&lt;/ref&gt;

A special characteristic of ''commedia dell'arte'' are the ''[[lazzi]]''.

Many troupes were formed to perform ''commedia dell'arte'', including [[I Gelosi]] (which had actors such as Isabella Andreini, and her husband [[Francesco Andreini]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of the Harlequinade|last=Maurice|first=Sand|publisher=Benjamin Bloom, Inc.|year=1915|isbn=|location=New York|pages=135|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Confidenti Troupe, Desioi Troupe, and Fedeli Troupe.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Commedia dell'arte'' was often performed outside on platforms or in popular areas such as a [[Town square|piazza]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Commedia Dell'Arte An Actor's Handbook|last=Rudlin|first=John|publisher=Ruutaledge|year=1994|isbn=0-415-04769-2|location=London and New York|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The form of theatre originated in Italy, but travelled throughout Europe and even to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World of Harlequin: A Critical Study of the Commedia dell'Arte.|last=Nicoll|first=Allardyce|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|year=1963|location=London|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''commedia'' genesis may be related to [[carnival]] in Venice, where by 1570 the author/actor [[Andrea Calmo]] had created the character Il Magnifico, the precursor to the [[vecchio]] (old man) Pantalone. In the [[Flaminio Scala]] scenario for example, Il Magnifico persists and is interchangeable with Pantalone, into the seventeenth century. While Calmo's characters (which also included the Spanish Capitano and a [[dottore]] type) were not masked, it is uncertain at what point the characters donned the mask. However, the connection to carnival (the period between [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] and [[Ash Wednesday]]) would suggest that masking was a convention of carnival and was applied at some point. The tradition in Northern Italy is centered in Mantua, Florence, and Venice, where the major companies came under the aegis of the various dukes. Concomitantly, a Neapolitan tradition emerged in the south and featured the prominent stage figure [[Pulcinella]]. Pulcinella has been long associated with Naples, and derived into various types elsewhere—the most famous as the puppet character Punch (of the eponymous [[Punch and Judy]] shows) in England.

==History==
[[File:Four Commedia dell’Arte Figures claude-gillot.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Claude Gillot]] (1673–1722), ''Four Commedia dell'arte Figures: Three Gentlemen and Pierrot'', c.&amp;nbsp;1715]]

Although ''commedia dell'arte'' flourished in Italy during the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] period, there has been a long-standing tradition of trying to establish historical antecedents in antiquity. While we can detect formal similarities between the ''commedia dell'arte'' and earlier theatrical traditions, there is no way to establish certainty of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Castagno p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Some date the origins to the period of the Roman Republic ([[Fabula palliata|Plautine types]]) or the Empire ([[Atellan Farce]]s). The [[Atellan Farce]]s of the Roman Empire featured crude "types" wearing masks with grossly exaggerated features and an improvised plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commedia Dell'Arte|last=Smith|first=Winifred|publisher=Benjamin Blom|year=1964|isbn=|location=New York|pages=26|quote=Atellanae were forced marked by improvisations and masked personages...|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians argue that Atellan stock characters, Pappus, Maccus+Buccus, and Manducus, are the primitive versions of the Commedia characters [[Pantalone]], [[Pulcinella]], and [[il Capitano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Duchartre|first=Pierre|publisher=Dover Publications, INC|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|page=29|quote=Pulcinella was always dressed in white like Maccus, the mimus albus, or white mime.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Duchartre|first=Pierre|publisher=Dover Publication, INC|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|page=18|quote=Next there is the ogre Manducus, the Miles Glorious in the plays of Plautus, who is later metamorphosed into the swaggering Captain, of Captain.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Duchartre|first=Pierre|publisher=Dover Publications, INC|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|page=18|quote=...Bucco and the sensual Maccus, whose lean figure and cowardly nature reappear in Pulcinella.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent accounts establish links to the medieval jongleurs, and prototypes from medieval moralities, such as Hellequin (as the source of Harlequin, for example).&lt;ref&gt;Palleschi: Part One&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded ''commedia dell'arte'' performances came from Rome as early as 1551.&lt;ref&gt;Katritzky p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; ''Commedia dell'arte'' was performed outdoors in temporary venues by professional actors who were costumed and masked, as opposed to {{lang|it|commedia erudita}}, which were written comedies, presented indoors by untrained and unmasked actors.&lt;ref&gt;Rudlin p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; This view may be somewhat romanticized since records describe the [[I Gelosi|Gelosi]] performing [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]'s ''[[Aminta]]'', for example, and much was done at court rather than in the street.  By the mid-16th century, specific troupes of ''commedia'' performers began to coalesce, and by 1568 the Gelosi became a distinct company. In keeping with the tradition of the Italian Academies, I Gelosi adopted as their impress (or coat of arms) the two-faced Roman god [[Janus]]. Janus symbolized both the comings and goings of this traveling troupe, and the dual nature of the actor who impersonates the "other." The Gelosi performed in Northern Italy and France where they received protection and patronage from the King of France. Despite fluctuations the Gelosi maintained stability for performances with the "usual ten": "two ''vecchi'' (old men), four ''[[innamorati]]'' (two male and two female lovers), two ''[[zanni]]'', a captain and a ''servetta'' (serving maid)".&lt;ref name="Rudlin &amp; Crick, p. 15"/&gt; It should be noted that ''commedia'' often performed inside in court theatres or halls, and also as some fixed theatres such as Teatro Baldrucca in Florence. Flaminio Scala, who had been a minor performer in the Gelosi published the scenarios of the ''commedia dell'arte'' around the start of the 17th century, really in an effort to legitimize the form—and ensure its legacy. These scenari are highly structured and built around the symmetry of the various types in duet: two {{lang|it|zanni}}, {{lang|it|vecchi}}, {{lang|it|inamorate}} and {{lang|it|inamorati}}, etc.

In ''commedia dell'arte'', female roles were played by women, documented as early as the 1560s. In the 1570s, English theatre critics generally denigrated the troupes with their female actors (some decades later, [[Ben Jonson]] referred to one female performer of the ''commedia'' as a "tumbling  whore"). By the end of the 1570s, Italian prelates attempted to ban female performers; however, by the end of the 16th century, actresses were standard on the Italian stage.&lt;ref&gt;Katritzky, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian scholar Ferdinando Taviani has collated a number of church documents opposing the advent of the actress as a kind of courtesan, whose scanty attire and promiscuous lifestyle corrupted young men, or at least infused them with carnal desires. Taviani's term ''negativa poetica'' describes this and other practices offensive to the church, while giving us an idea of the phenomenon of the ''commedia dell'arte'' performance.

By the early 17th century, the ''zanni'' comedies were moving from pure improvisational street performances to specified and clearly delineated acts and characters. Three books written during the 17th century—Cecchini's ''Fruti della moderne commedia'' (1628), [[Niccolò Barbieri]]'s ''La supplica'' (1634) and Perrucci's ''Dell'arte rapresentativa'' (1699—"made firm recommendations concerning performing practice." Katritzky argues, that as a result, ''commedia'' was reduced to formulaic and stylized acting; as far as possible from the purity of the improvisational genesis a century earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Katritzky p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; In France, during the reign of [[Louis XIV]], the [[Comédie-Italienne]] created a repertoire and delineated new masks and characters, while deleting some of the Italian precursors, such as Pantalone. French playwrights, particularly [[Molière]], gleaned from the plots and masks in creating an indigenous treatment. Indeed, Molière shared the stage with the Comédie-Italienne at [[Théâtre du Petit-Bourbon|Petit-Bourbon]], and some of his forms, e.g. the [[tirade]], are derivative from the ''commedia'' (''tirata'').

''Commedia dell'arte'' moved outside the city limits to the {{lang|fr|théâtre de la foire}}, or fair theatres, in the early 17th century as it evolved toward a more pantomimed style. With the dispatch of the Italian comedians from France in 1697, the form transmogrified in the 18th century as genres such as ''[[comédie larmoyante]]'' gained in attraction in France, particularly through the plays of [[Pierre de Marivaux|Marivaux]]. Marivaux softened the ''commedia'' considerably by bringing in true emotion to the stage. Harlequin achieved more prominence during this period.

It is possible that this kind of improvised acting was passed down the Italian generations until the 17th century, when it was revived as a professional theatrical technique. However, as currently used the term ''commedia dell'arte'' was coined in the mid-18th century.&lt;ref name="Katritzky p. 19"&gt;Katritzky p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Curiously, ''commedia dell'arte'' was equally if not more popular in France, where it continued its popularity throughout the 17th century (until 1697), and it was in France that ''commedia'' developed its established repertoire. ''Commedia'' evolved into various configurations across Europe, and each country acculturated the form to its liking. For example, [[pantomime]], which flourished in the 18th century, owes its genesis to the character types of the ''commedia'', particularly [[Harlequin]]. The [[Punch and Judy]] puppet shows, popular to this day in England, owe their basis to the [[Pulcinella]] mask that emerged in [[Naples|Neapolitan]] versions of the form. In Italy, ''commedia'' masks and plots found their way into the ''[[opera buffa]]'', and the plots of [[Rossini]], [[Verdi]], and [[Puccini]].

During the Napoleonic occupation of Italy, instigators of reform and critics of French Imperial rule (such as [[Giacomo Casanova]]) used the carnival masks to hide their identities while fueling political agendas, challenging social rule and hurling blatant insults and criticisms at the regime. In 1797, in order to destroy the impromptu style of carnival as a partisan platform, Napoleon outlawed the commedia dell'arte. It was not reborn in Venice until 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zainoo.com/en/italy/veneto/venice/carnival-venice|title=Carnival in Venice|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Companies ==
[[File:Commedia dell'arte - troupe Gelosi.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Commedia dell'arte troupe ''[[I Gelosi]]'' in a late 16th-century Flemish painting]]

''Compagnie'', or companies, were troupes of actors, each of whom had a specific function or role. Actors were versed in a plethora of skills, with many having joined troupes without a theatre background. Some were doctors, other priests, other soldiers, enticed by the excitement and prevalence of theatre in Italian society. Actors were known to switch from troupe to troupe "on loan," and companies would often collaborate if unified by a single patron or performing in the same general location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Ducharte|first=Pierre Louis|publisher=General Publishing Company|year=1966|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members would also splinter off to form their own troupes, such was the case with the Ganassa and the Gelosi.  These ''compagnie'' traveled throughout Europe from the early period, beginning with the ''Soldati'', then, the ''[[Zan Ganassa|Ganassa]]'', who traveled to Spain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kenley|first=M. E.|date=2012-11-01|title=Il Mattaccino: music and dance of the matachin and its role in Italian comedy|url=https://academic.oup.com/em/article/40/4/659/419718|journal=Early Music|language=en|volume=40|issue=4|pages=659–670|doi=10.1093/em/cas089|issn=0306-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were famous for playing the guitar and singing—never to be heard from again—and the famous troupes of the Golden Age (1580–1605): ''Gelosi'', ''Confidenti'', ''Accessi''. These names which signified daring and enterprise were appropriated from the names of the academies—in a sense, to lend legitimacy. However, each troupe had its ''impresse'' (like a coat of arms) which symbolized its nature. The Gelosi, for example, used the two-headed face of the Roman god [[Janus]], to signify its comings and goings and relationship to the season of [[carnival]], which took place in January. Janus also signified the duality of the actor, who is playing a character or mask, while still remaining oneself.

Magistrates and clergy were not always receptive to the traveling {{lang|it|compagnie}} (companies), particularly during periods of plague, and because of their itinerant nature. Actors, both male and female, were known to strip nearly naked, and storylines typically descended into crude situations with overt sexuality, considered to teach nothing but "lewdness and adultery...of both sexes" by the French Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Ducharte|first=Pierre Louis|publisher=General Publishing Company|year=1966|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term {{lang|it|vagabondi}} was used in reference to the {{lang|it|comici}}, and remains a derogatory term to this day ([[Vagabond (person)|vagabond]]). This was in reference to the nomadic nature of the troupes, often instigated by persecution from the Church, civil authorities, and rival theatre organisations that forced the companies to move from place to place. 

A troupe often consisted of ten performers of familiar masked and unmasked types, and included women.&lt;ref name="Rudlin &amp; Crick, p. 15"&gt;Rudlin &amp; Crick, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The companies would employ carpenters, props masters, servants, nurses, and prompters, all of whom would travel with the company. They would travel in large carts laden with supplies necessary for their nomadic style of performance, enabling them to move from place to place without having to worry about the difficulties of relocation. This nomadic nature, though influenced by persecution, was also largely due in part to the troupes requiring new (and paying) audiences. They would take advantage of public fairs and celebrations, most often in wealthier towns where financial success was more probable. Companies would also find themselves summoned by high-ranking officials, who would offer patronage in return for performing in their land for a certain amount of time. Companies in fact preferred to not stay in any one place too long, mostly out of a fear of the act becoming "stale." They would move on to the next location while their popularity was still active, ensuring the towns and people were sad to see them leave, and would be more likely to either invite them back or pay to watch performances again should the troupe ever return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Ducharte|first=Pierre Louis|publisher=General Publishing Company|year=1966|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prices were dependent on the troupe's decision, which could vary depending on the wealth of the location, the length of stay, and the regulations governments had in place for dramatic performances.

Generally, the actors playing were diverse in background in terms of class and religion, and performed anywhere they could. Castagno posits that the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] of exaggeration, distortion, anti-[[humanism]] (as in the masked types), and excessive borrowing as opposed to originality was typical of all the arts in the late [[Italian Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Castagno.{{Page needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre historian Martin Green points to the extravagance of emotion during the period of ''commedia''{{'}}s emergence as the reason for representational moods, or characters, that define the art. In commedia each character embodies a mood: mockery, sadness, gaiety, confusion, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Green, pp. xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 18th-century London theatre critic [[Giuseppe Marc'Antonio Baretti|Baretti]], ''commedia dell'arte'' incorporates specific roles and characters that were "originally intended as a kind of characteristic representative of some particular Italian district or town."&lt;ref name="Katritzky p. 19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/939808594|title=The Commedia dell'Arte|last=Oreglia|first=Giacomo|authorlink=:it:Giacomo Oreglia|year=1968|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang|isbn=|location=|pages=65, 71|oclc=939808594|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character's persona included the specific dialect of the region or town represented. Characters would often be passed down from generation to generation, and characters married onstage were often married in real life as well, seen most famously with Francesco and Isabella Andreini. This was believed to make performances more natural, as well as strengthening the bonds within the troupe, who emphasized complete unity between every member. Additionally, each character has a singular [[Costumes in commedia dell'arte|costume]] and mask that is representative of the character's role.&lt;ref name="Katritzky p. 19"/&gt;

''Commedia dell'arte'' has four stock character groups: the servants or ''Zanni'', these are characters such as Arlecchino, Brighella, and Pedrolino; the old men or ''vecchi'', characters such as Pantalone and il Dottore; the lovers or ''innamorati''  who would have names such as Flavio and Isabella; and the captains or ''Capitani'' who can also be La Signora if a female.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.factionoffools.org/history|title=Faction of Fools {{!}} A History of Commedia dell'Arte|website=www.factionoffools.org|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male servants and male masters (but not male ''amorosi'') are masked and those characters themselves are often referred to as "masks" (in Italian: ''maschere''), which, according to John Rudlin, cannot be separated from the character. In other words, the characteristics of the character and the characteristics of the mask are the same.&lt;ref&gt;Rudlin, ''An Actor's Handbook''. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; In time however, the word ''maschere'' came to refer to all of the characters of the ''commedia dell'arte'' whether masked or not. Female characters (including female servants) are most often not masked (female ''amorose'' are never masked). Female characters in the masters group are rare. Female servants wore bonnets. Their character was played with a malicious wit or gossipy gaiety. The ''amorosi'' are often children of a male character in the masters group, but not of any female character in the masters group, which may represent younger women who have e.g. married an old man, or a high-class courtesan. Female characters in the masters group, while younger than their male counterparts, are nevertheless older than the ''amorosi''. The servants or the [[clown]]s are referred to as the ''zanni'' and include characters such as [[Arlecchino]] (also known as [[Harlequin]]), [[Brighella]], [[Scapino]] and [[Pedrolino]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudlin, ''An Actor's Handbook''. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the better known ''commedia dell'arte'' characters are [[Pierrot]] and Pierrette, [[Pantalone]], [[Il Dottore]], [[Brighella]], [[Il Capitano]], [[Colombina]], the ''innamorati'', [[Pedrolino]], [[Pulcinella]], [[Sandrone]], [[Scaramuccia]] (also known as Scaramouche), [[La Signora]], and [[Tartaglia (commedia dell'arte)|Tartaglia]].

In the 17th century as ''commedia'' became popular in France, the characters of Pierrot, Columbine and Harlequin were refined and became essentially Parisian, according to Green.&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costumes ==
{{main|Costumes in commedia dell'arte}}
Each character in Commedia dell'arte has a distinct costume that helps the audience understand who the character is.

Arlecchino originally wore a tight fitting long jacket with matching trousers that both had numerous odd shaped patches, usually green, yellow, red, and brown.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Commedia dell'Arte An Actor's Handbook|last=Rudlin|first=John|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0-415-04769-2|location=New York|pages=67–156|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Ducharte|first=Pierre|publisher=Dover|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=164–207|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, there was a bat and a wallet that would hang from his belt.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; His hat, which was a soft cap, was modeled after Charles IX or after Henri II, and almost always had a tail of a rabbit, hare or a fox with the occasional tuft of feathers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During the 17th century, the patches turned into blue, red, and green triangles arranged in a symmetrical pattern.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The 18th century is when the iconic Arlecchino look with the diamond shaped lozenges took shape. The jacket became shorter and his hat changed from a soft cap to a double pointed hat.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Il Dottore's costume was a play on the academic dress of the Bolognese scholars.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Il Dottore is almost always clothed entirely in black.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He wore a long black gown or jacket that went below the knees.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Over the gown, he would have a long black robe that went down to his heels, and he would have on black shoes, stockings, and breeches.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 1653, his costume was changed by Augustin Lolli who was a very popular Il Dottore actor. He added an enormous black hat, changed the robe to a jacket cut similarly to Louis XIV, and added a flat ruff to the neck.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Il Capitano's costume is similar to Il Dottore's in the fact that it is also a satire on military wear of the time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This costume would therefore change depending on where the Capitano character is from, and the period the Capitano is from.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Pantalone has one of the most iconic costumes of Commedia dell'arte. Typically, he would wear a tightly fitting jacket with a matching pair of trousers. He usually pairs these two with a big black coat called a zimarra.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Women, who usually played servants or lovers, wore less stylized costumes than the men in commedia. The lovers, [[Innamorati]], would wear what was considered to be the fashion of the time period. They would only wear plain half-masks with no character distinction or street makeup.

== Subjects ==
Conventional plot lines were written on themes of [[sex]], [[jealousy]], [[love]] and [[old age]]. Many of the basic plot elements can be traced back to the Roman comedies of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], some of which were themselves translations of lost Greek comedies of the 4th century BC. However, it is more probable that the ''comici'' used contemporary novella, or, traditional sources as well, and drew from current events and local news of the day. Not all scenari were comic, there were some mixed forms and even tragedies. Shakespeare's ''The Tempest'' is drawn from a popular scenario in the Scala collection, his Polonius (''Hamlet'') is drawn from Pantalone, and his clowns bear homage to the ''zanni''.

''Comici'' performed written comedies at court. Song and dance were widely used, and a number of ''innamorati'' were skilled [[Madrigal (Trecento)|madrigalists]], a song form that uses chromatics and close [[harmonies]]. Audiences came to see the performers, with plot lines becoming secondary to the performance. Among the great ''innamorate'', [[Isabella Andreini]] was perhaps the most widely known, and a medallion dedicated to her reads "eternal fame". [[Tristano Martinelli]] achieved international fame as the first of the great Arlecchinos, and was honored by the [[Medici]] and the Queen of France. Performers made use of well-rehearsed jokes and stock physical gags, known as ''[[lazzi]]'' and ''[[wikt:concetto|concetti]]'', as well as on-the-spot improvised and [[Interpolation (music)|interpolated]] episodes and routines, called {{lang|it|burle}} (singular {{lang|it|burla}}, Italian for joke), usually involving a practical joke.

Since the productions were improvised, dialogue and action could easily be changed to satirize local scandals, current events, or regional tastes, while still using old jokes and punchlines. Characters were identified by costumes, masks, and [[theatrical properties|props]], such as a type of baton known as a [[slapstick]]. These characters included the forebears of the modern [[clown]], namely [[Harlequin]] ({{lang|it|arlecchino}}) and the [[zanni]]. Harlequin, in particular, was allowed to comment on current events in his entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/939808594|title=The Commedia dell'Arte|last=Oreglia|first=Giacomo|year=1968|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang|isbn=|location=|page=58|oclc=939808594|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classic, traditional plot is that the ''innamorati'' are in love and wish to be married, but one elder (''vecchio'') or several elders (''vecchi'') are preventing this from happening, leading the lovers to ask one or more ''zanni'' (eccentric servants) for help. Typically the story ends happily, with the marriage of the ''innamorati'' and forgiveness for any wrongdoings. There are countless variations on this story, as well as many that diverge wholly from the structure, such as a well-known story about Arlecchino becoming mysteriously pregnant, or the [[Punch and Judy]] scenario.

While generally personally unscripted, the performances often were based on scenarios that gave some semblance of plot to the largely improvised format. The [[Flaminio Scala]] scenarios, published in the early 17th century, are the most widely known collection and representative of its most esteemed compagnia, [[I Gelosi]].

The iconography of the ''commedia dell'arte'' represents an entire field of study that has been examined by ''commedia'' scholars such as Erenstein, Castagno, Katritzky, Molinari, and others. In the early period, representative works by painters at [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] were notable for their erotic depictions of the thinly veiled ''innamorata'', or the bare-breasted courtesan/actress. The Flemish influence is widely documented as ''commedia'' figures entered the world of the ''[[vanitas]]'' genre, depicting the dangers of lust, drinking, and the hedonistic lifestyle. Castagno describes the Flemish ''pittore vago'' (wandering painters) who assimilated themselves within Italian workshops and even assumed Italian surnames: One of the most influential painters, Lodewyk Toeput, for example, became Ludovico Pozzoserrato and was a celebrated painter in the Veneto region of Italy. The ''pittore vago'' can be attributed with establishing ''commedia dell'arte'' as a genre of painting that would persist for centuries.

While the iconography gives evidence of the performance style (see Fossard collection), it is important to note that many of the images and engravings were not depictions from real life, but concocted in the studio. The [[Jacques Callot|Callot]] etchings of the Balli di Sfessania (1611) are most widely considered ''[[capriccio (art)|capricci]]'' rather than actual depictions of a ''commedia'' dance form, or typical masks. While these are often reproduced in large formats, it is important to note that the actual prints measured about 2×3 inches. In the 18th century, [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]]'s painting of ''commedia'' figures intermingling with the aristocracy were often set in sumptuous garden or pastoral settings and were representative of that genre.

[[Picasso]]'s painting ''[[Three Musicians]]'' painted in 1921 is a colorful representation of ''commedia''-inspired characters.&lt;ref&gt;Katritzky p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso also designed the original costumes for [[Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]'' (1920), a ballet depicting ''commedia'' characters and situations. ''Commedia'' iconography is evident in porcelain figurines many selling for thousands of dollars at auction.

[[File:Peeter van Bredael Commedia dell arte Szene.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Peeter van Bredael]], ''Commedia dell'arte Scene in an Italian Landscape'']]

The expressive theatre influenced [[Molière]]'s comedy and subsequently ''[[ballet d'action]]'', thus lending a fresh range of expression and choreographic means. An example of a ''commedia dell'arte'' character in literature is the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin]] who is dressed as [[Harlequin]].

Music and dance were central to ''commedia dell'arte'' performance. Brighella was often depicted with a guitar, and many images of the ''commedia'' feature singing ''innamorati'' or dancing figures. In fact, it was considered part of the ''innamorati'' function to be able to sing and have the popular repertoire under their belt. Accounts of the early ''commedia'', as far back as [[Calmo]] in the 1570s and the [[buffoni]] of Venice, note the ability of comici to sing [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]i precisely and beautifully. The [[danzatrice]] probably accompanied the troupes, and may have been in addition to the general cast of characters. For examples of strange instruments of various grotesque formations see articles by Tom Heck, who has documented this area.

The works of a number of playwrights have featured characters influenced by the ''commedia dell'arte'' and sometimes directly drawn from it. Prominent examples include ''[[The Tempest]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Les Fourberies de Scapin]]'' by [[Molière]], ''[[Servant of Two Masters]]'' (1743) by [[Carlo Goldoni]], the ''Figaro'' plays of [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], and especially ''[[Love for Three Oranges]]'', ''[[Turandot (Gozzi)|Turandot]]'' and other ''fiabe'' by [[Carlo Gozzi]]. Influences appear in the lodgers in [[Steven Berkoff]]'s adaptation of [[Franz Kafka]]'s ''[[The Metamorphosis]]''.

Through their association with spoken theatre and playwrights ''commedia'' figures have provided opera with many of its stock characters. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' sets a puppet show story and comic servants like Leporello and Figaro have ''commedia'' precedents. Soubrette characters like Susanna in ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'', Zerlina in ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and Despina in ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' recall Columbina and related characters. The comic operas of [[Gaetano Donizetti]], such as ''[[Elisir d'amore]]'', draw readily upon ''commedia'' stock types. [[Leoncavallo]]'s tragic melodrama ''[[Pagliacci]]'' depicts a ''commedia dell'arte'' company in which the performers find their life situations reflecting events they depict on stage. ''Commedia'' characters also figure in [[Richard Strauss]]'s opera ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]''.

Stock characters and situations also appear in ballet. [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' and ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]'' allude directly to the tradition.

'''''Cranky Geeks''''' was a [[technology]]-related Internet show produced by [[Ziff Davis Media]] centered on discussion of technology topics of the week. It was hosted by industry [[pundit (expert)|pundit]] [[John C. Dvorak]]. Each week three guest panelists, usually selected from a pool of technology journalists and entrepreneurs, joined Dvorak.

The show, formerly produced by [[TechTV]]'s Annaliza Savage, premiered to viewers of DL.TV on March 15, 2006 and has since received its own website. The show is similar to Dvorak's previous show, [[Silicon Spin]].

The show was [[Streaming media|streamed]] live weekly on Wednesdays at 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[North American Eastern Standard Time Zone|ET]]/1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Pacific Standard Time Zone|PT]] from the [[Ziff Davis]] office in [[San Francisco, California]].  In addition, it was offered for download in multiple file sizes and formats after the live show aired. This included a video or audio podcast which viewers could subscribe to in [[iTunes]] or any other podcasting client.

Show guests included [[Martin Sargent]], [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Adam Curry]], [[Chris DiBona]], [[Om Malik]], [[Larry Lessig]], [[Leo Laporte]], [[Veronica Belmont]], [[John Markoff]], [[Natalie Del Conte]], [[Robert Scoble]], [[Jimmy Wales]], [[Alex Albrecht]], [[Molly Wood]] and [[Kevin Rose]]. Dvorak has humorously mentioned his intention to invite [[Danica Patrick]], the [[IndyCar]] driver endorsing [[Go Daddy]], one of the show's sponsors, whose commercial airs in every episode.

In May 2010, the show's "Co-Crank," permanent guest/sidekick [[Sebastian Rupley]], who appeared on the show from its inception, announced he was leaving the show.

On his nightly Tech5 podcast episode for September 15, 2010, host John C. Dvorak announced that they had produced that day's Cranky Geeks show (September 15, 2010) and also the final-ever Cranky Geeks show to be released the following Wednesday, September 22, 2010.

'''''Ecchi na Bunny-san wa Kirai?''''' (Japanese: エッチなバニーさんは嫌い?; translated as ''Do You Like Horny Bunnies?'') is a [[bishōjo game]] developed by [[ZyX (company)|ZyX]] and released by [[G-Collections]] in 2003.

The game is a multi-scenario interactive [[eroge]], although there is about five or ten minutes of clicking through dialogue before it becomes interactive. The main character is 18-year old Yukari Fujisawa, a feminine-looking [[Japan]]ese boy who has never had sex with a girl. He starts working as a waiter in a membership restaurant, Platinum, where all the female employees wear [[Playboy Bunny|Playboy bunny suits]]. Soon he finds out that the other waitresses, including his own cousin Sae Ishigami, have very unusual sexual tendencies.

The game features the original Japanese voices along with an English translation and is uncensored.

A sequel, ''[[Do You Like Horny Bunnies? 2]]'',  which is set in another branch of Platinum with cameos from the original's characters, was also released in February 2004.

==Story==
Yukari Fujisawa is a boy who works at the Platinum restaurant, an exclusive Italian eatery. He was employed for a strange and embarrassing reason:he was mistaken as a girl. The girls are good at figuring it out, but either they will either ruin his job or the discovery can make his and their jobs and lives much easier and more fun, exciting, interesting, and especially enjoyable.

==Gameplay==
At the beginning of the game, the player learns about Yukari Fujisawa's life. If the player selects options that do not lead the protagonist to a specific possibility too many times, Yukari will get fired and the player will be forced back to the title screen.

==Characters==
'''Yukari Fujisawa''': He is an 18-year-old boy, despite his feminine appearance. He has plenty of friends at his school. In the game, he is shown to be a decent [[judo]] student and takes care of exotic fish in his free time.

'''Sae Ishigami''': Yukari's cousin. In their childhood they were inseparable, but they grew distant as the years went on. They are later reunited at Platinum. Sae is an exhibitionist and therefore enjoys being watched while performing sexual acts.

'''Hiromi Yanagi''': Sae's best pal appears to be the probable to work in a bunny suit. She dresses completely with a pair of glasses and a stylish appearance. Luckily for her, she easily opens up to Yukari.

'''Ryo Kugenuma''': Despite the fact that she is the youngest of the team, she is by far the most mature. Her serious attitude comes from her parents. Although she would seem more fitting as an executive of a major company and not a waitress in a bunny suit, she is still proud of her work at Platinum. Ryo enjoys consuming the sperm of her partner.

'''Chimaki Hase''': The eldest of the bunnies at Platinum, despite looking young and immature. She has no shame in meeting Yukari. It is shown that Chimaki is addicted to Yukari.

'''Akina Inamura''': She is called "The big boss of Platinum" by her co-workers. She seems to be a strange case at first and greets people in a way that she thinks is cute.

==Sequel==
A sequel titled "''Do You Like Horny Bunnies? 2''" was released in 2002. The game focuses on a new character, Kazuma Takatsuki, and the story takes place in another branch of the Platinum. The game also features cameos of characters from the original game.

The last player left is declared the winner and the next round begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctac.esrc.unimelb.edu.au/biogs/E000139b.htm|title=Downball - Ball Game - Childhood, Tradition and Change PUBLIC DATABASE|first=The University of|last=Melbourne|website=ctac.esrc.unimelb.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually played by schoolchildren.

Downball walls were built in school yards.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Downball is distinct from [[Four square]], which is played on a marked court on the ground without a wall.

== Rules ==
Downball is usually played with a tennis ball. Any number of players can participate. The game area usually consists of a single wall, against which the players hit the ball. The ball must hit the ground once before hitting the wall. A player has the option to let the ball bounce once after hitting the wall or may choose to hit it straight away. The round begins with the champion serving the ball against the wall (one bounce on the ground then off the wall back into play). The other players hit the ball back at the wall in turn. The order of play stays the same throughout the match. 

Players who fail to hit the ball back against the wall or hit the ball out of bounds go "out". When a player is "out" that player must vacate the field of play and not interfere with play until the next match (not round). 

A match is made up of as many rounds needed to get all but one players out of the game. The survivor becomes the champion and serves during the next match. In the event that the ball is hit by every player to the end of the line of players the game will continue in a loop. In the event the champion goes out, the player second in line becomes the champion for the remainder of the match.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Downball often incorporates the addition of the "shark shot". This is played by hitting the ball on the full into another player's body with that player going out of the game. A player who misses a "Shark shot" also goes out of the game.

'''Football, Football''' is a theatre show produced by the [[East West Theatre Company]] in cooperation with [[Napoli Teatro Festival Italia]], [[Singapore Arts Festival]], Flota Institute from Slovenia, Ballets C. de la B, and patronage by Fondazione Cannavaro Ferrara Napoli Teatro Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teatrofestivalitalia.it/Napoli_Teatro_Festival_Italia_Performances_2010_Football_Football-1458.1357.8.html/ Napoli Teatro Festival; Official Website &amp;#91;cited December 08, 2011&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Football, Football'' was directed, conceived and written by [[Haris Pašović]]. Since the opening in May 2010, it has been performed for fifteen times on three continents ( Asia, Europe, and Africa). The artists from four continents (Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia) and seven countries (Italy,  Singapore, China, Slovenia,Burkina Faso, Bosnia and Herzegovina,  and Australia) participated in this project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastwest.ba/football-football/ East West Theatre Company Official Website &amp;#91;cited December 08, 2011&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Football Football'', explores the phenomenon of football and its impact on ordinary people, includes a combination of dance and football, which director Haris Pasovic has called "football dance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demotix.com/news/358094/football-football-performance-bosnia-and-herzegovina/ Demotix News: ''"Football, Football" performance in Bosnia and Herzegovina'' &amp;#91;cited December 08, 2011&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is set in a guns-and-drugs-ridden ghetto of [[Scampia]] in [[Naples]], the fiefdom of [[Camorra]] (Italy’s second largest mafia group), where a group of young people play soccer every night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaya.com.ph/06232010/liv5.html/ Business Insight Malaya Inc: ''Football dance play a global soccer celebration'' &amp;#91;cited December 08, 2011&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; The setting is similar to the slums where some of the football’s greatest players, such as [[Diego Maradona]] and [[Zinedine Zidane]], grew up. Young people living here dream about better life and football career. Some of them are from the immigrant families, some are unemployed Italians, but all of them the ''scugnizzi'' - a term for Neapolitan street children. The lives of these ''emarginati'', (the marginalized ones) are suspended between the gloomy reality and their dreams about soccer. They are too old to start a football career and too young to give up their hopes. One day, a Stranger shows up among them. Suddenly they find themselves in the boots of some of the greatest players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastwest.ba/football-football/ East West Theatre Company Official Website &amp;#91;cited December 08, 2011&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Live music, dance, football, story-telling drama and video interplay are some of the major elements of this production's narrative.

'''''GamePlay''''' was a Croatian video game magazine which used to be published on monthly basis, first priced at 18 [[Croatian kuna|kunas]], and then later at 20 kunas. It is considered to be the successor of ''PSX'', with most of the team behind ''PSX'' also working on GamePlay. It covered a wide range of gaming platforms, always bringing the latest news, previews, reviews and features. The first issue came out on 28 November 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/13294/gameplay-jedini-casopis-za-igrace-konzole|title=GAMEPLAY - jedini časopis za igraće konzole (in Croatian)|date=27 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the final (99th) issue was released in February 2011. Though the publishing group planned to create a new version of ''GamePlay'' magazine and site, the plans were not realised.&lt;ref name="goodgame.hr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodgame.hr/povijest-hrvatskog-gaming-novinarstva-3/|title=Povijest hrvatskog gaming novinarstva (in Croatian)|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the team started working on another video game magazine ''Next Level'', which is considered as a successor to ''GamePlay''. The magazine also had an accompanying online news site and a forum for discussions. It had around 100 pages.

The magazine was started by the same team who worked on the ''PSX'' magazine. It was carefully projected to satisfy all the demographics playing video games. Their main goal was to keep nurturing and help expand the gaming culture in Croatia. In the wake of magazine's launch on 28 November 2002, Dario Zrno had stated:
"Our main goal is to keep creating the gaming culture in Croatia and to prepare the players for the near online boom, when the consoles will connect to Internet and when finally the online console gaming can start in Croatia as well. Soon, you'll be able to live in the virtual world of 'Star Wars', Harry Potter or Tolkien and let's not forget you'll be able to play a few games against Brasil online. All that is coming in less than half a year." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/13294/gameplay-jedini-casopis-za-igrace-konzole|title=GAMEPLAY - jedini časopis za igraće konzole (in Croatian)|date=27 November 2002|quote=“Naš glavni cilj je nastaviti stvarati gaming kulturu u Hrvatskoj i pripremiti igrače za skori online boom, kad će se igraće konzole spojiti na Internet i kad će napokon i u Hrvatskoj započeti online igranje na konzolama. Uskoro ćete moći živjeti u virtualnom svijetu ‘Ratova zvijezda’, Harryja Pottera ili Tolkiena, a ne zaboravimo da ćete moći odigrati i pokoju online utakmicu protiv Brazila. A sve to dolazi za manje od pola godine”-Dario Zrno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine was redesigned in 2005 and PC was added as one of the gaming platforms they're covering. In 2005, the team behind ''GamePlay'' was also joined by the people who worked on another video game magazine ''Hacker'', which ceased to publish in 2005. The quality of the magazine was always gradually improving and was always on a high note.

However, the problems started near the end of 2010 when the publishing group NCL ran into financial problems. The publishers asked the team to print the magazine on a paper of lesser quality, with less pages and reduced costs. The team of ''GamePlay'' refused such terms and the last, 99th, issue came out in February 2011.&lt;ref name="goodgame.hr"/&gt; NCL had plans to create a new version of ''GamePlay'' magazine and site, but they never came through.&lt;ref name="goodgame.hr"/&gt; The team set out to create a new magazine called ''Next Level''.&lt;ref name="poslovnipuls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poslovnipuls.com/2011/03/28/gameplay-nextlevel/|title=Ekipa Gameplaya dala otkaz u Nacionalu kako bi pokrenula novi gaming časopis NextLevel|work=PoslovniPuls|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Game theory''' is the study of [[mathematical model]]s of strategic interaction between rational decision-makers.&lt;ref name=Myerson&gt;[[Roger B. Myerson|Myerson, Roger B.]] (1991). ''Game Theory: Analysis of Conflict,'' Harvard University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E8WQFRCsNr0C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA1 1]. Chapter-preview links, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E8WQFRCsNr0C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR7 vii–xi].&lt;/ref&gt; It has applications in all fields of [[social science]], as well as in [[logic]] and [[computer science]]. Originally, it addressed [[zero-sum game]]s, in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an [[umbrella term]] for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.

Modern game theory began with the idea regarding the existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person [[zero-sum game]]s and its proof by [[John von Neumann]]. Von Neumann's original proof used the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] on continuous mappings into compact [[convex set]]s, which became a standard method in game theory and [[mathematical economics]]. His paper was followed by the 1944 book ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'', co-written with [[Oskar Morgenstern]], which considered [[cooperative game]]s of several players. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.

Game theory was developed extensively in the 1950s by many scholars. It was later explicitly applied to biology in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields. {{As of|2014}}, with the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] going to game theorist [[Jean Tirole]], eleven game theorists have won the economics Nobel Prize. [[John Maynard Smith]] was awarded the [[Crafoord Prize]] for his application of game theory to biology.

==History==
[[File:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif|thumb|[[John von Neumann]]]]
[[File:John f nash 20061102 3.jpg|thumb|[[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]]]]

Early discussions of examples of two-person games occurred long before the rise of modern, mathematical game theory. The first known discussion of game theory occurred in a letter written by Charles Waldegrave, an active Jacobite, and uncle to [[James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave|James Waldegrave]], a British diplomat, in 1713.&lt;ref name="GT-PD-01"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jehps.net/Decembre2007/Bellhouse.pdf |title=The Problem of Waldegrave |author=Bellhouse, David |journal=Journal Électronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique |year=2007 |volume=3 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this letter, Waldegrave provides a [[minimax]] [[mixed strategy]] solution to a two-person version of the card game [[le Her]], and the problem is now known as [[Waldegrave problem]]. [[James Madison]] made what is now recognized as a game-theoretic analysis of the ways states can be expected to behave under different systems of taxation.&lt;ref&gt;James Madison, [http://www.constitution.org/jm/17870400_vices.htm Vices of the Political System of the United States], April 1787.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Rakove, [http://www.historynow.org/09_2007/historian2.html "James Madison and the Constitution"], ''History Now'', Issue 13, September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411192100/http://www.historynow.org/09_2007/historian2.html |date=11 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1838 ''Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses'' (''Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth''), [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] considered a [[duopoly]] and presents a solution that is a restricted version of the [[Nash equilibrium]].

In 1913, [[Ernst Zermelo]] published ''Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels'' (''On an Application of Set Theory to the Theory of the Game of Chess''). It proved that the optimal chess strategy is [[Strictly determined game|strictly determined]]. This paved the way for more general theorems.&lt;ref name=ohet /&gt;{{rp|429}}

In 1938, the Danish mathematical economist [[Frederik Zeuthen]] proved that the mathematical model had a winning strategy by using [[Brouwer fixed point theorem|Brouwer's fixed point theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Kim, Sungwook|title=Game theory applications in network design|page=3|publisher=IGI Global|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phOXBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1938 book ''Applications aux Jeux de Hasard'' and earlier notes, [[Émile Borel]] proved a minimax theorem for two-person zero-sum matrix games only when the pay-off matrix was symmetric. Borel conjectured that non-existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games would occur, a conjecture that was proved false.

Game theory did not really exist as a unique field until [[John von Neumann]] published the paper ''On the Theory of Games of Strategy'' &lt;!--singluar, as only one referenced in Aumann (1987)--&gt; in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=J. v. |last=Neumann |year=1928 |title=Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=295–320 |doi=10.1007/BF01448847}} English translation: {{citation |chapter=On the Theory of Games of Strategy |editor1-first=A.

Von Neumann's work in game theory culminated in this 1944 book. This foundational work contains the method for finding mutually consistent solutions for two-person zero-sum games. During the following time period, work on game theory was primarily focused on [[cooperative game]] theory, which analyzes optimal strategies for groups of individuals, presuming that they can enforce agreements between them about proper strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Leonard |first=Robert |title=Von Neumann, Morgenstern, and the Creation of Game Theory |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=9780521562669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the first mathematical discussion of the [[prisoner's dilemma]] appeared, and an experiment was undertaken by notable mathematicians [[Merrill M. Flood]] and [[Melvin Dresher]], as part of the [[RAND Corporation]]'s investigations into game theory. RAND pursued the studies because of possible applications to global [[nuclear strategy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/ Prisoner's Dilemma]. Plato.stanford.edu (4 September 1997). Retrieved on 3 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this same time, [[John Forbes Nash|John Nash]] developed a criterion for mutual consistency of players' strategies, known as [[Nash equilibrium]], applicable to a wider variety of games than the criterion proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern. Nash proved that every n-player, non-zero-sum (not just 2-player zero-sum) [[non-cooperative game]] has what is now known as a Nash equilibrium.

Game theory experienced a flurry of activity in the 1950s, during which time the concepts of the [[core (economics)|core]], the [[extensive form game]], [[fictitious play]], [[repeated game]]s, and the [[Shapley value]] were developed. In addition, the first applications of game theory to [[philosophy]] and [[political science]] occurred during this time.

In 1979 [[Robert Axelrod]] tried setting up computer programs as players and found that in tournaments between them the winner was often a simple "tit-for-tat" program that cooperates on the first step, then on subsequent steps just does whatever its opponent did on the previous step. The same winner was also often obtained by natural selection; a fact widely taken to explain cooperation phenomena in evolutionary biology and the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1104|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prize-winning achievements===

In 1965, [[Reinhard Selten]] introduced his [[solution concept]] of [[Subgame perfect equilibrium|subgame perfect equilibria]], which further refined the Nash equilibrium (later he would introduce [[trembling hand perfection]] as well). In 1994 Nash, Selten and [[John Harsanyi|Harsanyi]] became [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Economics Nobel Laureates]] for their contributions to economic game theory.

In the 1970s, game theory was extensively applied in [[biology]], largely as a result of the work of [[John Maynard Smith]] and his [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. In addition, the concepts of [[correlated equilibrium]], trembling hand perfection, and [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]]&lt;ref&gt;Although common knowledge was first discussed by the philosopher [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] in his dissertation (and later book) ''Convention'' in the late 1960s, it was not widely considered by economists until [[Robert Aumann]]'s work in the 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt; were introduced and analyzed.

In 2005, game theorists [[Thomas Schelling]] and [[Robert Aumann]] followed Nash, Selten and Harsanyi as Nobel Laureates. Schelling worked on dynamic models, early examples of [[evolutionary game theory]]. Aumann contributed more to the equilibrium school, introducing an equilibrium coarsening, correlated equilibrium, and developing an extensive formal analysis of the assumption of common knowledge and of its consequences.

In 2007, [[Leonid Hurwicz]], together with [[Eric Maskin]] and [[Roger Myerson]], was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics "for having laid the foundations of [[mechanism design]] theory". Myerson's contributions include the notion of [[proper equilibrium]], and an important graduate text: ''Game Theory, Analysis of Conflict''.&lt;ref name=Myerson /&gt; Hurwicz introduced and formalized the concept of [[incentive compatibility]].

In 2012, [[Alvin E. Roth]] and [[Lloyd Shapley|Lloyd S. Shapley]] were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics "for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design" and, in 2014, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel]] went to game theorist [[Jean Tirole]].

==Game types==

===Cooperative / Non-cooperative===
{{main|Cooperative game|Non-cooperative game}}
A game is ''cooperative'' if the players are able to form binding commitments externally enforced (e.g. through [[contract law]]). A game is ''non-cooperative'' if players cannot form alliances or if all agreements need to be [[Self-enforcing agreement|self-enforcing]] (e.g. through [[credible threat]]s).&lt;sup&gt;[[Cooperative game theory#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Cooperative games are often analysed through the framework of ''cooperative game theory''''',''' which focuses on predicting which coalitions will form, the joint actions that groups take and the resulting collective payoffs. It is opposed to the traditional ''non-cooperative game theory'' which focuses on predicting individual players' actions and payoffs and analyzing [[Nash equilibria]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Cooperative game theory#cite note-2|[2]]][[Cooperative game theory#cite note-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Cooperative game theory provides a high-level approach as it only describes the structure, strategies and payoffs of coalitions, whereas non-cooperative game theory also looks at how bargaining procedures will affect the distribution of payoffs within each coalition. As non-cooperative game theory is more general, cooperative games can be analyzed through the approach of non-cooperative game theory (the converse does not hold) provided that sufficient assumptions are made to encompass all the possible strategies available to players due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperation. While it would thus be optimal to have all games expressed under a non-cooperative framework, in many instances insufficient information is available to accurately model the formal procedures available to the players during the strategic bargaining process, or the resulting model would be of too high complexity to offer a practical tool in the real world. In such cases, cooperative game theory provides a simplified approach that allows analysis of the game at large without having to make any assumption about bargaining powers.

===Symmetric / Asymmetric===
{{Payoff matrix |Name=An asymmetric game |2L=E |2R=F |1U=E |UL=1, 2 |UR=0, 0 |1D=F |DL=0, 0 |DR=1, 2}}
{{main|Symmetric game}}
A symmetric game is a game where the payoffs for playing a particular strategy depend only on the other strategies employed, not on who is playing them. If the identities of the players can be changed without changing the payoff to the strategies, then a game is symmetric. Many of the commonly studied 2×2 games are symmetric. The standard representations of [[Game of chicken|chicken]], the [[prisoner's dilemma]], and the [[stag hunt]] are all symmetric games. Some{{Who|date=July 2012}} scholars would consider certain asymmetric games as examples of these games as well. However, the most common payoffs for each of these games are symmetric.

Most commonly studied asymmetric games are games where there are not identical strategy sets for both players. For instance, the [[ultimatum game]] and similarly the [[dictator game]] have different strategies for each player. It is possible, however, for a game to have identical strategies for both players, yet be asymmetric. For example, the game pictured to the right is asymmetric despite having identical strategy sets for both players.

===Zero-sum / Non-zero-sum===
{{Payoff matrix |Name=A zero-sum game |2L=A |2R=B |1U=A |UL=–1, 1 |UR=3, –3 |1D=B |DL=0, 0 |DR=–2, 2}}
{{main|Zero-sum game}}
Zero-sum games are a special case of constant-sum games, in which choices by players can neither increase nor decrease the available resources. In zero-sum games the total benefit to all players in the game, for every combination of strategies, always adds to zero (more informally, a player benefits only at the equal expense of others).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Game Theory: Third Edition |last=Owen |first=Guillermo |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |year=1995 |isbn=0-12-531151-6 |location=Bingley |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poker]] exemplifies a zero-sum game (ignoring the possibility of the house's cut), because one wins exactly the amount one's opponents lose. Other zero-sum games include [[matching pennies]] and most classical board games including [[Go (board game)|Go]] and [[chess]].

Many games studied by game theorists (including the famed [[prisoner's dilemma]]) are non-zero-sum games, because the [[Outcome (game theory)|outcome]] has net results greater or less than zero. Informally, in non-zero-sum games, a gain by one player does not necessarily correspond with a loss by another.

Constant-sum games correspond to activities like theft and gambling, but not to the fundamental economic situation in which there are potential [[gains from trade]]. It is possible to transform any game into a (possibly asymmetric) zero-sum game by adding a dummy player (often called "the board") whose losses compensate the players' net winnings.

===Simultaneous / Sequential===
{{main|Simultaneous game|Sequential game}}
[[Simultaneous game]]s are games where both players move simultaneously, or if they do not move simultaneously, the later players are unaware of the earlier players' actions (making them ''effectively'' simultaneous). [[Sequential game]]s (or dynamic games) are games where later players have some knowledge about earlier actions. This need not be [[perfect information]] about every action of earlier players; it might be very little knowledge. For instance, a player may know that an earlier player did not perform one particular action, while s/he does not know which of the other available actions the first player actually performed.

The difference between simultaneous and sequential games is captured in the different representations discussed above. Often, [[Normal form game|normal form]] is used to represent simultaneous games, while [[Extensive form game|extensive form]] is used to represent sequential ones. The transformation of extensive to normal form is one way, meaning that multiple extensive form games correspond to the same normal form. Consequently, notions of equilibrium for simultaneous games are insufficient for reasoning about sequential games; see [[subgame perfection]].

In short, the differences between sequential and simultaneous games are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"

|}

===Perfect information and imperfect information===
{{main|Perfect information}}
[[File:PD with outside option.svg|thumb|250px|right|A game of imperfect information (the dotted line represents ignorance on the part of player 2, formally called an [[Information set (game theory)|information set]])]]

An important subset of sequential games consists of games of [[perfect information]]. A game is one of perfect information if all players know the moves previously made by all other players. Most games studied in game theory are imperfect-information games.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Examples of perfect-information games include [[tic-tac-toe]], [[Draughts|checkers]], [[infinite chess]], and [[Go (board game)|Go]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/Game_Theory/mat.pdf https://www.math.ucla.edu] Game Theory (Ferguson).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/845380/complete-vs-perfect-infomation-in-combinatorial-game-theory https://math.stackexchange.com] Complete vs Perfect information in Combinatorial game theory.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6b10/22cb68df1918513948830734be796e052fe2.pdf https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org] Games with Perfect Information (Mycielski).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN-I6u-AxMg "Infinite Chess, PBS Infinite Series"] PBS Infinite Series. Perfect information defined at 0:25, with academic sources https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4377 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many card games are games of imperfect information, such as [[poker]] and [[contract bridge|bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Game Theory: Third Edition |last=Owen |first=Guillermo |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |year=1995 |isbn=0-12-531151-6 |location=Bingley |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perfect information is often confused with [[complete information]], which is a similar concept.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Complete information requires that every player know the strategies and payoffs available to the other players but not necessarily the actions taken. Games of incomplete information can be reduced, however, to games of imperfect information by introducing "[[Move by nature|moves by nature]]".{{sfnp|Leyton-Brown|Shoham|2008|p=60}}

==={{vanchor|Combinatorial games}}===
&lt;!-- visible anchor to link to, for example at "Solving chess" --&gt;

Games in which the difficulty of finding an optimal strategy stems from the multiplicity of possible moves are called combinatorial games. Examples include chess and go. Games that involve [[Perfect information|imperfect information]] may also have a strong combinatorial character, for instance [[backgammon]]. There is no unified theory addressing combinatorial elements in games. There are, however, mathematical tools that can solve particular problems and answer general questions.&lt;ref name="Bewersdorff2005" /&gt;

Games of [[perfect information]] have been studied in [[combinatorial game theory]], which has developed novel representations, e.g. [[surreal numbers]], as well as [[Combinatorics|combinatorial]] and [[Abstract algebra|algebraic]] (and [[Strategy stealing argument|sometimes non-constructive]]) proof methods to [[Solved game|solve games]] of certain types, including "loopy" games that may result in infinitely long sequences of moves. These methods address games with higher combinatorial complexity than those usually considered in traditional (or "economic") game theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Albert |first1=Michael H. |author1-link=Michael H. Albert |last2=Nowakowski |first2=Richard J. |last3=Wolfe |first3=David |isbn=978-1-56881-277-9 |publisher=A K Peters Ltd |title=Lessons in Play: In Introduction to Combinatorial Game Theory |year=2007 |pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Beck |first=József |author-link=József Beck |isbn=978-0-521-46100-9 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |title=Combinatorial games: tic-tac-toe theory |year=2008 |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical game that has been solved this way is [[Hex (board game)|hex]]. A related field of study, drawing from [[computational complexity theory]], is [[game complexity]], which is concerned with estimating the computational difficulty of finding optimal strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Robert A. Hearn |author2=Erik D. Demaine |title=Games, Puzzles, and Computation |year=2009 |publisher=A K Peters, Ltd. |isbn=978-1-56881-322-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in [[artificial intelligence]] has addressed both perfect and imperfect information games that have very complex combinatorial structures (like chess, go, or backgammon) for which no provable optimal strategies have been found. The practical solutions involve computational heuristics, like [[alpha-beta pruning]] or use of [[artificial neural network]]s trained by [[reinforcement learning]], which make games more tractable in computing practice.&lt;ref name="Bewersdorff2005"&gt;{{citation |author=[[Jörg Bewersdorff]] |title=Luck, logic, and white lies: the mathematics of games |year=2005 |publisher=A K Peters, Ltd. |isbn=978-1-56881-210-6 |pages=ix–xii and chapter 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones2008"&gt;{{citation |author=M. Tim Jones |title=Artificial Intelligence: A Systems Approach |year=2008 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |isbn=978-0-7637-7337-3 |pages=106–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infinitely long games===
{{main|Determinacy}}
Games, as studied by economists and real-world game players, are generally finished in finitely &lt;!--Do not change to 'infinitely'--&gt;many moves. Pure mathematicians are not so constrained, and [[Set theory|set theorists]] in particular study games that last for infinitely many moves, with the winner (or other payoff) not known until ''after'' all those moves are completed.

The focus of attention is usually not so much on the best way to play such a game, but whether one player has a [[Determinacy#Basic notions|winning strategy]]. (It can be proven, using the [[axiom of choice]], that there are games{{spaced ndash}}even with perfect information and where the only outcomes are "win" or "lose"{{spaced ndash}}for which ''neither'' player has a winning strategy.) The existence of such strategies, for cleverly designed games, has important consequences in [[descriptive set theory]].

===Discrete and continuous games===
Much of game theory is concerned with finite, discrete games, that have a finite number of players, moves, events, outcomes, etc. Many concepts can be extended, however. [[Continuous game]]s allow players to choose a strategy from a continuous strategy set. For instance, [[Cournot competition]] is typically modeled with players' strategies being any non-negative quantities, including fractional quantities.

===Differential games===
[[Differential game]]s such as the continuous [[Pursuit-evasion|pursuit and evasion game]] are continuous games where the evolution of the players' state variables is governed by [[differential equation]]s. The problem of finding an optimal strategy in a differential game is closely related to the [[optimal control]] theory. In particular, there are two types of strategies: the open-loop strategies are found using the [[Pontryagin's Minimum Principle|Pontryagin maximum principle]] while the closed-loop strategies are found using [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation|Bellman's Dynamic Programming]] method.

A particular case of differential games are the games with a random [[time horizon]].&lt;ref name="PM66"&gt;{{ru icon}} Petrosjan, L.A. and Murzov, N.V. (1966). ''Game-theoretic problems of mechanics''. ''Litovsk. Mat. Sb.'' 6, 423–433.&lt;/ref&gt; In such games, the terminal time is a random variable with a given [[probability distribution]] function. Therefore, the players maximize the [[mathematical expectation]] of the cost function. It was shown that the modified optimization problem can be reformulated as a discounted differential game over an infinite time interval.

===Evolutionary game theory===
[[Evolutionary game theory]] studies players who adjust their strategies over time according to rules that are not necessarily rational or farsighted.&lt;ref name=Newton2018renaissance&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Newton | first1=Jonathan | year=2018 | title=Evolutionary Game Theory: A Renaissance | journal=Games | volume=9 | issue=2| doi=10.3390/g9020031}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, the evolution of strategies over time according to such rules is modeled as a [[Markov chain]] with a state variable such as the current strategy profile or how the game has been played in the recent past. Such rules may feature imitation, optimization or survival of the fittest.

In biology, such models can represent (biological) [[evolution]], in which offspring adopt their parents' strategies and parents who play more successful strategies (i.e. corresponding to higher payoffs) have a greater number of offspring. In the social sciences, such models typically represent strategic adjustment by players who play a game many times within their lifetime and, consciously or unconsciously, occasionally adjust their strategies.{{sfnp|Webb|2007}}

===Stochastic outcomes (and relation to other fields)===
Individual decision problems with stochastic outcomes are sometimes considered "one-player games". These situations are not considered game theoretical by some authors.{{By whom|date=March 2011}} They may be modeled using similar tools within the related disciplines of [[decision theory]], [[operations research]], and areas of [[artificial intelligence]], particularly [[AI planning]] (with uncertainty) and [[multi-agent system]]. Although these fields may have different motivators, the mathematics involved are substantially the same, e.g. using [[Markov decision process]]es (MDP).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Stochastic outcomes can also be modeled in terms of game theory by adding a randomly acting player who makes "chance moves" ("[[Move by nature|moves by nature]]").{{sfnp|Osborne|Rubinstein|1994}} This player is not typically considered a third player in what is otherwise a two-player game, but merely serves to provide a roll of the dice where required by the game.

For some problems, different approaches to modeling stochastic outcomes may lead to different solutions. For example, the difference in approach between MDPs and the [[Minimax|minimax solution]] is that the latter considers the worst-case over a set of adversarial moves, rather than reasoning in expectation about these moves given a fixed probability distribution. The minimax approach may be advantageous where stochastic models of uncertainty are not available, but may also be overestimating extremely unlikely (but costly) events, dramatically swaying the strategy in such scenarios if it is assumed that an adversary can force such an event to happen.&lt;ref name="McMahan"&gt;Hugh Brendan McMahan (2006), ''[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mcmahan/research/mcmahan_thesis.pdf Robust Planning in Domains with Stochastic Outcomes, Adversaries, and Partial Observability]'', CMU-CS-06-166, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Black swan theory]] for more discussion on this kind of modeling issue, particularly as it relates to predicting and limiting losses in investment banking.)

General models that include all elements of stochastic outcomes, adversaries, and partial or noisy observability (of moves by other players) have also been studied. The "[[gold standard]]" is considered to be partially observable [[stochastic game]] (POSG), but few realistic problems are computationally feasible in POSG representation.&lt;ref name="McMahan" /&gt;

===Metagames===
These are games the play of which is the development of the rules for another game, the target or subject game. [[Metagame]]s seek to maximize the utility value of the rule set developed. The theory of metagames is related to [[mechanism design]] theory.

The term [[metagame analysis]] is also used to refer to a practical approach developed by Nigel Howard.{{sfnp|Howard|1971}} whereby a situation is framed as a strategic game in which stakeholders try to realise their objectives by means of the options available to them. Subsequent developments have led to the formulation of [[confrontation analysis]].

===Pooling games===
These are games prevailing over all forms of society. Pooling games are repeated plays with changing payoff table in general over an experienced path and their equilibrium strategies usually take a form of evolutionary social convention and economic convention. Pooling game theory emerges to formally recognize the interaction between optimal choice in one play and the emergence of forthcoming payoff table update path, identify the invariance existence and robustness, and predict variance over time. The theory is based upon topological transformation classification of payoff table update over time to predict variance and invariance, and is also within the jurisdiction of the computational law of reachable optimality for ordered system.&lt;ref&gt;Wenliang Wang (2015). Pooling Game Theory and Public Pension Plan. {{isbn|978-1507658246}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mean field game theory===
[[Mean field game theory]] is the study of strategic decision making in very large populations of small interacting agents. This class of problems was considered in the economics literature by [[Boyan Jovanovic]] and [[Robert W. Rosenthal]], in the engineering literature by [[Peter E. Caines]] and by mathematician [[Pierre-Louis Lions]] and Jean-Michel Lasry.

==Representation of games==
{{see also|List of games in game theory}}

The games studied in game theory are well-defined mathematical objects. To be fully defined, a game must specify the following elements: the [[Player (game)|''players'' of the game]], the ''information'' and ''actions'' available to each player at each decision point, and the [[Utility|''payoffs'']] for each outcome. (Eric Rasmusen refers to these four "essential elements" by the acronym "PAPI".)&lt;ref name="r7" /&gt; A game theorist typically uses these elements, along with a [[solution concept]] of their choosing, to deduce a set of equilibrium [[Strategy (game theory)|strategies]] for each player such that, when these strategies are employed, no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy. These equilibrium strategies determine an [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] to the game—a stable state in which either one outcome occurs or a set of outcomes occur with known probability.

Most cooperative games are presented in the characteristic function form, while the extensive and the normal forms are used to define noncooperative games.

===Extensive form===
{{main|Extensive form game}}
[[File:Ultimatum Game Extensive Form.svg|thumb|left|An extensive form game]]
The extensive form can be used to formalize games with a time sequencing of moves. Games here are played on [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]] (as pictured here). Here each [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|vertex]] (or node) represents a point of choice for a player. The player is specified by a number listed by the vertex. The lines out of the vertex represent a possible action for that player. The payoffs are specified at the bottom of the tree. The extensive form can be viewed as a multi-player generalization of a [[decision tree]].{{sfnp|Fudenberg|Tirole|1991|p=67}} To solve any extensive form game, [[backward induction]] must be used. It involves working backward up the game tree to determine what a rational player would do at the last vertex of the tree, what the player with the previous move would do given that the player with the last move is rational, and so on until the first vertex of the tree is reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Security Studies: an Introduction (second edition) |last=Williams |first=Paul D. |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn= |location=2 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon, OX14 4RN |pages=55–56 |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game pictured consists of two players.  The way this particular game is structured (i.e., with sequential decision making and perfect information), ''Player 1'' "moves" first by choosing either ''F'' or ''U'' (Fair or Unfair). Next in the sequence, ''Player 2'', who has now seen ''Player 1''{{'}}s move, chooses to play either ''A'' or ''R''. Once ''Player 2'' has made his/ her choice, the game is considered finished and each player gets their respective payoff.  Suppose that ''Player 1'' chooses ''U'' and then ''Player 2'' chooses ''A'': ''Player 1'' then gets a payoff of "eight" (which in real-world terms can be interpreted in many ways, the simplest of which is in terms of money but could mean things such as eight days of vacation or eight countries conquered or even eight more opportunities to play the same game against other players) and ''Player 2'' gets a payoff of "two".

The extensive form can also capture simultaneous-move games and games with imperfect information. To represent it, either a dotted line connects different vertices to represent them as being part of the same information set (i.e. the players do not know at which point they are), or a closed line is drawn around them. (See example in the [[#Perfect information and imperfect information|imperfect information section]].)

{{main|Normal-form game}}
The normal (or strategic form) game is usually represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] which shows the players, strategies, and payoffs (see the example to the right). More generally it can be represented by any function that associates a payoff for each player with every possible combination of actions. In the accompanying example there are two players; one chooses the row and the other chooses the column. Each player has two strategies, which are specified by the number of rows and the number of columns. The payoffs are provided in the interior. The first number is the payoff received by the row player (Player 1 in our example); the second is the payoff for the column player (Player 2 in our example). Suppose that Player 1 plays ''Up'' and that Player 2 plays ''Left''. Then Player 1 gets a payoff of 4, and Player 2 gets 3.

When a game is presented in normal form, it is presumed that each player acts simultaneously or, at least, without knowing the actions of the other. If players have some information about the choices of other players, the game is usually presented in extensive form.

Every extensive-form game has an equivalent normal-form game, however the transformation to normal form may result in an exponential blowup in the size of the representation, making it computationally impractical.{{sfnp|Leyton-Brown|Shoham|2008|p=35}}

===Characteristic function form===
{{main|Cooperative game}}
In games that possess removable utility, separate rewards are not given; rather, the characteristic function decides the payoff of each unity. The idea is that the unity that is 'empty', so to speak, does not receive a reward at all.

The origin of this form is to be found in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's book; when looking at these instances, they guessed that when a union &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; appears, it works against the fraction
&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\mathbf{N}}{\mathbf{C}}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
as if two individuals were playing a normal game. The balanced payoff of C is a basic function. Although there are differing examples that help determine coalitional amounts from normal games, not all appear that in their function form can be derived from such.

Formally, a characteristic function is seen as: (N,v), where N represents the group of people and &lt;math&gt;v:2^N \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a normal utility.

Such characteristic functions have expanded to describe games where there is no removable utility.

==General and applied uses==

As a method of [[applied mathematics]], game theory has been used to study a wide variety of human and animal behaviors. It was initially developed in [[economics]] to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including behaviors of firms, markets, and consumers. The first use of game-theoretic analysis was by [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] in 1838 with his solution of the [[Cournot competition|Cournot duopoly]]. The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded, and game theory has been applied to political, sociological, and psychological behaviors as well.

Although pre-twentieth century [[Natural history|naturalists]] such as [[Charles Darwin]] made game-theoretic kinds of statements, the use of game-theoretic analysis in biology began with [[Ronald Fisher]]'s studies of animal behavior during the 1930s. This work predates the name "game theory", but it shares many important features with this field. The developments in economics were later applied to biology largely by [[John Maynard Smith]] in his book ''[[Evolution and the Theory of Games]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=On economic applications of evolutionary game theory|url=https://leeps.ucsc.edu/media/papers/EconAppEvolGameTheory3-1-98.pdf|journal=J Evol Econ|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being used to describe, predict, and explain behavior, game theory has also been used to develop theories of ethical or normative behavior and to [[Decision theory#Normative and descriptive decision theory|prescribe]] such behavior.&lt;ref name="Camerer2003"&gt;[[Colin F. Camerer]] (2003). ''Behavioral Game Theory: Experiments in Strategic Interaction'', pp. 5–7 (scroll to at [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7517.html 1.1 What Is Game Theory Good For?]).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[economics and philosophy]], scholars have applied game theory to help in the understanding of good or proper behavior. Game-theoretic arguments of this type can be found as far back as [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2008/entries/game-theory/ |title=Game Theory |accessdate=21 August 2008 |last=Ross |first=Don |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2008 Edition) |publisher=Edward N. Zalta (ed.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description and modeling===
[[File:Centipede game.svg|thumb|300px|right|A four-stage [[centipede game]]]]
The primary use of game theory is to describe and [[Conceptual model#Economic models|model]] how human populations behave. Some{{Who|date=July 2012}} scholars believe that by finding the equilibria of games they can predict how actual human populations will behave when confronted with situations analogous to the game being studied. This particular view of game theory has been criticized. It is argued that the assumptions made by game theorists are often violated when applied to real-world situations. Game theorists usually assume players act rationally, but in practice, human behavior often deviates from this model. Game theorists respond by comparing their assumptions to those used in [[physics]]. Thus while their assumptions do not always hold, they can treat game theory as a reasonable scientific [[Idealization (science philosophy)|ideal]] akin to the models used by [[physicist]]s. However, empirical work has shown that in some classic games, such as the [[centipede game]], [[guess 2/3 of the average]] game, and the [[dictator game]], people regularly do not play Nash equilibria. There is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of these experiments and whether the analysis of the experiments fully captures all aspects of the relevant situation.&lt;ref&gt;Experimental work in game theory goes by many names, [[experimental economics]], [[behavioral economics]], and [[behavioural game theory]] are several. For a recent discussion, see Colin F. Camerer (2003). ''Behavioral Game Theory: Experiments in Strategic Interaction'' ([http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7517.html description] and [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7517.html Introduction], pp.&amp;nbsp;1–25).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some game theorists, following the work of [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[George R. Price]], have turned to [[evolutionary game theory]] in order to resolve these issues. These models presume either no rationality or [[bounded rationality]] on the part of players. Despite the name, evolutionary game theory does not necessarily presume [[natural selection]] in the biological sense. Evolutionary game theory includes both biological as well as cultural evolution and also models of individual learning (for example, [[fictitious play]] dynamics).

===Prescriptive or normative analysis===
{{Payoff matrix |Name=The [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] | 2L=Cooperate |2R=Defect |1U=Cooperate |UL=-1, -1 |UR=-10, 0 |1D=Defect |DL=0, -10 |DR=-5, -5}}
Some scholars, like [[Leonard Savage]],{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} see game theory not as a predictive tool for the behavior of human beings, but as a suggestion for how people ought to behave. Since a strategy, corresponding to a [[Nash equilibrium]] of a game constitutes one's [[best response]] to the actions of the other players – provided they are in (the same) Nash equilibrium – playing a strategy that is part of a Nash equilibrium seems appropriate. This normative use of game theory has also come under criticism.

Game theory is a major method used in [[mathematical economics]] and business for [[Economic model|modeling]] competing behaviors of interacting [[Agent (economics)|agents]].&lt;ref name=r1 /&gt; Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as [[auction]]s, [[bargaining]], [[mergers &amp; acquisitions]] pricing,&lt;ref name="GT-A-E-00" /&gt; [[fair division]], [[Duopoly|duopolies]], [[Oligopoly|oligopolies]], [[social network]] formation, [[agent-based computational economics]],&lt;ref name=r2 /&gt; [[general equilibrium]], [[mechanism design]],&lt;ref name=r3 /&gt; and [[voting system]]s;&lt;ref name=r4 /&gt; and across such broad areas as [[experimental economics]],&lt;ref name=r5 /&gt; [[Behavioral game theory|behavioral economics]],&lt;ref name=r6 /&gt; [[information economics]],&lt;ref name=r7 /&gt; [[industrial organization]],&lt;ref name=r8 /&gt; and [[political economy]].&lt;ref name=r9 /&gt;&lt;ref name=r10 /&gt;

This research usually focuses on particular sets of strategies known as [[Solution concept|"solution concepts" or "equilibria"]]. A common assumption is that players act rationally. In non-cooperative games, the most famous of these is the [[Nash equilibrium]]. A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies. If all the players are playing the strategies in a Nash equilibrium, they have no unilateral incentive to deviate, since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are doing.&lt;ref name="GT-F-R-09"&gt;[http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 Game-theoretic model to examine the two tradeoffs in the acquisition of information for a careful balancing act] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524231021/http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 |date=24 May 2013 }} Research paper [[INSEAD]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GT-F-R-10"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140327103727/http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 Options Games: Balancing the trade-off between flexibility and commitment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620053305/http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 |date=20 June 2013 }}.

The payoffs of the game are generally taken to represent the [[utility]] of individual players.

A prototypical paper on game theory in economics begins by presenting a game that is an abstraction of a particular economic situation. One or more solution concepts are chosen, and the author demonstrates which strategy sets in the presented game are equilibria of the appropriate type. Naturally one might wonder to what use this information should be put. Economists and business professors suggest two primary uses (noted above): ''descriptive'' and ''[[Decision theory#Normative and descriptive decision theory|prescriptive]]''.&lt;ref name="Camerer2003" /&gt;

===Political science===
The application of game theory to [[political science]] is focused in the overlapping areas of [[fair division]], [[political economy]], [[public choice]], [[war's inefficiency puzzle|war bargaining]], [[positive political theory]], and [[social choice theory]]. In each of these areas, researchers have developed game-theoretic models in which the players are often voters, states, special interest groups, and politicians.

Early examples of game theory applied to political science are provided by [[Anthony Downs]]. In his book ''[[An Economic Theory of Democracy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citations|last1=Downs|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; he applies the [[Hotelling's law|Hotelling firm location model]] to the political process. In the Downsian model, political candidates commit to ideologies on a one-dimensional policy space. Downs first shows how the political candidates will converge to the ideology preferred by the median voter if voters are fully informed, but then argues that voters choose to remain rationally ignorant which allows for candidate divergence. Game Theory was applied in 1962 to the [[Cuban missile crisis]] during the presidency of John F. Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Brams, [https://plus.maths.org/content/game-theory-and-cuban-missile-crisis Game theory and the Cuban missile crisis], Plus Magazine, 1 January 2001, accessed 31 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been proposed that game theory explains the stability of any form of political government.  Taking the simplest case of a monarchy, for example, the king, being only one person, does not and cannot maintain his authority by personally exercising physical control over all or even any significant number of his subjects.  Sovereign control is instead explained by the recognition by each citizen that all other citizens expect each other to view the king (or other established government) as the person whose orders will be followed.  Coordinating communication among citizens to replace the sovereign is effectively barred, since conspiracy to replace the sovereign is generally punishable as a crime.  Thus, in a process that can be modeled by variants of the [[prisoner's dilemma]], during periods of stability no citizen will find it rational to move to replace the sovereign, even if all the citizens know they would be better off if they were all to act collectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2371076 |title=Yes, Law is the Command of the Sovereign |journal= SSRN Electronic Journal|year=2013 |last1=Morrison |first1=A. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A game-theoretic explanation for [[Democratic peace theory|democratic peace]] is that public and open debate in democracies sends clear and reliable information regarding their intentions to other states. In contrast, it is difficult to know the intentions of nondemocratic leaders, what effect concessions will have, and if promises will be kept. Thus there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is a non-democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1162/154247604323015463 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/539/ |jstor=40004867 |title=It Takes Two: An Explanation for the Democratic Peace |journal=Journal of the European Economic Association |volume=2 |page=1 |year=2004 |last1=Levy |first1=G. |last2=Razin |first2=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, game theory predicts that two countries may still go to war even if their leaders are cognizant of the costs of fighting. War may result from asymmetric information; two countries may have incentives to mis-represent the amount of military resources they have on hand, rendering them unable to settle disputes agreeably without resorting to fighting. Moreover, war may arise because of commitment problems: if two countries wish to settle a dispute via peaceful means, but each wishes to go back on the terms of that settlement, they may have no choice but to resort to warfare. Finally, war may result from issue indivisibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fearon |first=James D. |date=1 January 1995 |title=Rationalist Explanations for War |journal=International Organization |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=379–414 |doi=10.1017/s0020818300033324 |jstor=2706903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Game theory could also help predict a nation's responses when there is a new rule or law to be applied to that nation. One example would be Peter John Wood's (2013) research when he looked into what nations could do to help reduce climate change. Wood thought this could be accomplished by making treaties with other nations to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. However, he concluded that this idea could not work because it would create a [[prisoner's dilemma]] to the nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=Peter John |year=2011 |title=Climate change and game theory |url= |journal=[[Ecological Economics Review]] |volume=1219 |issue= |pages=153–70 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05891.x|hdl=1885/67270|bibcode=2011NYASA1219..153W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology===

{{main|Evolutionary game theory}}

Unlike those in economics, the payoffs for games in [[biology]] are often interpreted as corresponding to [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. In addition, the focus has been less on [[solution concept|equilibria]] that correspond to a notion of rationality and more on ones that would be maintained by [[evolution]]ary forces. The best-known equilibrium in biology is known as the ''[[evolutionarily stable strategy]]'' (ESS), first introduced in {{harv|Smith|Price|1973}}. Although its initial motivation did not involve any of the mental requirements of the [[Nash equilibrium]], every ESS is a Nash equilibrium.

In biology, game theory has been used as a model to understand many different phenomena. It was first used to explain the evolution (and stability) of the approximate 1:1 [[sex ratio]]s. {{harv|Fisher|1930}} suggested that the 1:1 sex ratios are a result of evolutionary forces acting on individuals who could be seen as trying to maximize their number of grandchildren.

Additionally, biologists have used [[evolutionary game theory]] and the ESS to explain the emergence of [[animal communication]].{{sfnp|Harper|Maynard Smith|2003}} The analysis of [[signaling games]] and [[Cheap talk|other communication games]] has provided insight into the evolution of communication among animals. For example, the [[mobbing behavior]] of many species, in which a large number of prey animals attack a larger predator, seems to be an example of spontaneous emergent organization. Ants have also been shown to exhibit feed-forward behavior akin to fashion (see [[Paul Ormerod]]'s ''[[Butterfly Economics]]'').

Biologists have used the [[Chicken (game)|game of chicken]] to analyze fighting behavior and territoriality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Maynard Smith |first1=J. |title=The theory of games and the evolution of animal conflicts |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(74)90110-6 |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=209–221 |year=1974 |pmid=4459582 |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maynard Smith, in the preface to ''Evolution and the Theory of Games'', "paradoxically, it has turned out that game theory is more readily applied to biology than to the field of economic behaviour for which it was originally designed". Evolutionary game theory has been used to explain many seemingly incongruous phenomena in nature.&lt;ref name="stan-egt"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-evolutionary/ Evolutionary Game Theory (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]. Plato.stanford.edu. Retrieved on 3 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

One such phenomenon is known as [[Altruism in animals|biological altruism]]. This is a situation in which an organism appears to act in a way that benefits other organisms and is detrimental to itself. This is distinct from traditional notions of altruism because such actions are not conscious, but appear to be evolutionary adaptations to increase overall fitness. Examples can be found in species ranging from vampire bats that regurgitate blood they have obtained from a night's hunting and give it to group members who have failed to feed, to worker bees that care for the queen bee for their entire lives and never mate, to [[vervet monkey]]s that warn group members of a predator's approach, even when it endangers that individual's chance of survival.&lt;ref name="qudzyh"&gt;[http://www.seop.leeds.ac.uk/entries/altruism-biological/ Biological Altruism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]. Seop.leeds.ac.uk. Retrieved on 3 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these actions increase the overall fitness of a group, but occur at a cost to the individual.

Evolutionary game theory explains this altruism with the idea of [[kin selection]]. Altruists discriminate between the individuals they help and favor relatives. [[Hamilton's rule]] explains the evolutionary rationale behind this selection with the equation {{Math|c &lt; b &amp;times; r}}, where the cost {{varserif|c}} to the altruist must be less than the benefit {{varserif|b}} to the recipient multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness {{varserif|r}}. The more closely related two organisms are causes the incidences of altruism to increase because they share many of the same alleles. This means that the altruistic individual, by ensuring that the alleles of its close relative are passed on through survival of its offspring, can forgo the option of having offspring itself because the same number of alleles are passed on. For example, helping a sibling (in diploid animals) has a coefficient of ½, because (on average) an individual shares ½ of the alleles in its sibling's offspring. Ensuring that enough of a sibling's offspring survive to adulthood precludes the necessity of the altruistic individual producing offspring.&lt;ref name="qudzyh" /&gt; The coefficient values depend heavily on the scope of the playing field; for example if the choice of whom to favor includes all genetic living things, not just all relatives, we assume the discrepancy between all humans only accounts for approximately 1% of the diversity in the playing field, a coefficient that was ½ in the smaller field becomes 0.995. Similarly if it is considered that information other than that of a genetic nature (e.g. epigenetics, religion, science, etc.) persisted through time the playing field becomes larger still, and the discrepancies smaller.

===Computer science and logic===
Game theory has come to play an increasingly important role in [[logic]] and in [[computer science]]. Several logical theories have a basis in [[game semantics]]. In addition, computer scientists have used games to model [[interactive computation]]s. Also, game theory provides a theoretical basis to the field of [[multi-agent system]]s.

Separately, game theory has played a role in [[online algorithm]]s; in particular, the [[k-server problem]], which has in the past been referred to as ''games with moving costs'' and ''request-answer games''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citations |last1=Ben David |last2=Borodin |last3=Karp |last4=Tardos |last5=Wigderson |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yao's principle]] is a game-theoretic technique for proving [[Upper and lower bounds|lower bounds]] on the [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] of [[randomized algorithm]]s, especially online algorithms.

The emergence of the internet has motivated the development of algorithms for finding equilibria in games, markets, computational auctions, peer-to-peer systems, and security and information markets. [[Algorithmic game theory]]&lt;ref name="algorithmic-game" /&gt; and within it [[algorithmic mechanism design]]&lt;ref name=r11 /&gt; combine computational [[algorithm design]] and analysis of [[complex system]]s with economic theory.&lt;ref name=r12 /&gt;

===Philosophy===
{{Payoff matrix |Name=[[Stag hunt]] | 2L=Stag |2R=Hare |1U=Stag |UL=3, 3 |UR=0, 2 |1D=Hare |DL=2, 0 |DR=2, 2}}
Game theory has been put to several uses in [[philosophy]]. Responding to two papers by {{harvard citations|txt=yes|first=W.V.O.|last=Quine|author1-link=Willard Van Orman Quine|year=1960|year2=1967}}, {{Harvtxt|Lewis|1969}} used game theory to develop a philosophical account of [[Convention (norm)|convention]]. In so doing, he provided the first analysis of [[Common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] and employed it in analyzing play in [[coordination game]]s. In addition, he first suggested that one can understand [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] in terms of [[signaling games]]. This later suggestion has been pursued by several philosophers since Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;({{Harvtxt|Skyrms|1996}}, {{harvard citations |txt=yes |last1=Grim |last2=Kokalis |last3=Alai-Tafti |last4=Kilb |last5=St Denis |year=2004}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Following {{Harvtxt|Lewis|1969}} game-theoretic account of conventions, Edna Ullmann-Margalit (1977) and [[Cristina Bicchieri|Bicchieri]] (2006) have developed theories of [[social norms]] that define them as Nash equilibria that result from transforming a mixed-motive game into a coordination game.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=E. |last=Ullmann-Margalit |title=The Emergence of Norms |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1977 |isbn=0198244118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=C. |last=Bicchieri |title=The Grammar of Society: the Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0521573726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Game theory has also challenged philosophers to think in terms of interactive [[epistemology]]: what it means for a collective to have common beliefs or knowledge, and what are the consequences of this knowledge for the social outcomes resulting from the interactions of agents. Philosophers who have worked in this area include Bicchieri (1989, 1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Self-Refuting Theories of Strategic Interaction: A Paradox of Common Knowledge |journal=Erkenntnis |volume=30 |issue=1–2 |year=1989 |pages=69–85 |doi=10.1007/BF00184816 |last1=Bicchieri |first1=Cristina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Bicchieri |first1=Cristina |author1-link=Cristina Bicchieri |title=Rationality and Coordination |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-57444-7 |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Skyrms|Skyrms]] (1990),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Dynamics of Rational Deliberation |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1990 |isbn=067421885X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Stalnaker|Stalnaker]] (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=Knowledge, Belief, and Counterfactual Reasoning in Games |editor-first=Cristina |editor-last=Bicchieri |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Jeffrey |editor3-first=Brian |editor3-last=Skyrms |title=The Logic of Strategy |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |isbn=0195117158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ethics]], some (most notably David Gauthier, Gregory Kavka, and Jean Hampton) {{Who|date=July 2012}} authors have attempted to pursue [[Thomas Hobbes]]' project of deriving morality from self-interest. Since games like the [[prisoner's dilemma]] present an apparent conflict between morality and self-interest, explaining why cooperation is required by self-interest is an important component of this project. This general strategy is a component of the general [[social contract]] view in [[political philosophy]] (for examples, see {{Harvtxt|Gauthier|1986}} and {{Harvtxt|Kavka |1986}}).&lt;ref&gt;For a more detailed discussion of the use of game theory in ethics, see the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's entry [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-ethics/ game theory and ethics].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors have attempted to use [[evolutionary game theory]] in order to explain the emergence of human attitudes about morality and corresponding animal behaviors. These authors look at several games including the prisoner's dilemma, [[stag hunt]], and the [[Nash bargaining game]] as providing an explanation for the emergence of attitudes about morality (see, e.g., {{harvard citations|txt=yes|last=Skyrms|year=1996|year2=2004}} and {{harvard citations|txt=yes|last1=Sober|last2=Wilson|year=1999}}).

Since the transition into the modern-day [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]], [[homosexuality]] has appeared more frequently in American film and cinema. Compared to the 1900s, it is clear that the greater acceptance of homosexuality in the modern era has allowed more queer characters and issues to be seen with more respect and understanding in film and cinema.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Early films and productions==
[[File:DicksonFilm Still.png|thumb|''[[The Dickson Experimental Sound Film]]'' (1895)]]
The first notable form of homosexuality depicted in film was in 1895 between two men dancing together in the [[William Kennedy Dickson]] motion picture ''[[The Dickson Experimental Sound Film]]'', commonly labeled online and in three published books as ''The Gay Brothers''. Though, at the time, men were not seen this way as queer or even flamboyant, but merely acting fanciful.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite web |last=Morris |first=Gary |title=A Brief History of Queer Cinema |url=http://www.greencine.com/central/guide/queercinema?page=0%2C0 |publisher=GreenCine |accessdate=November 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Parker Tyler]] stated that the scene "shocked audiences with its subversion of conventional male behavior".&lt;ref name="mangin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mangin |first=Daniel |title=College Course File: The History of Gays and Lesbians on Film |journal=Journal of Film and Video |year=1989 |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=50–66 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |jstor=20687868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late nineteenth century and into the 1920s–30s, homosexuality was largely depicted in gender-based conventions and stereotypes. Oftentimes male characters intended to be identified as gay were flamboyant, effeminate, humorous characters in film.&lt;ref name="benshoff"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Benshoff, Harry M.  |author2=Griffin, Sean |title=Queer images: A History of Gay and Lesbian Film in America |year=2005 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |isbn=0742519724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "pansy" and "[[sissy]]" became tagged to homosexuality and was described as "a flowery, fussy, effeminate soul given to limp wrists and mincing steps".&lt;ref name="benshoff"/&gt; Because of his high-pitched voice and attitude, the pansy easily transitioned from the silent film era into the talking pictures where those characteristics could be taken advantage of.&lt;ref name="benshoff"/&gt; Male characters were depicted as having effeminate jobs in the work force, creating the stereotype that homosexuals were associated with these careers, which include tailor, hairdresser, choreographers, and many more. It was also during this time that characters in prison were being portrayed at homosexual. While queer male characters became associated as Pansies and sissies, queer female characters were not given a title rather, they were associated with cross dressing, having a deep voice, confusing and emasculating men, and as having a “man’s job.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lugowski|first=David M.|title=Queering the (New) Deal|date=2011-11-13|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9780470671153.wbhaf034|work=The Wiley-Blackwell History of American Film|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781405179843|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s, the cinema audience had decreased significantly. Filmmakers produced movies with themes and images that had high shock-value to get people returning to the theaters. This called for the inclusion of more controversial topics such as prostitution and violence, creating a demand for pansies and their lesbian counterparts to stimulate or shock the audience.&lt;ref name="benshoff"/&gt; With the new influx of these provocative subjects, debates arose regarding the negative effects these films could have on American society.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

It was during this same time that the United States Supreme Court ruled that films did not have First Amendment protection, due to the film industry being a business that could be easily used for “evil”, and several local governments passed laws restricting the public exhibition of "indecent" or "immoral" films. The media publicity surrounding several high-profile celebrity scandals and the danger of church-led boycotts also pressured the leadership within the film industry to establish a national censorship board, which became the [[Motion Picture Production Code]].

The Motion Picture Production Code, also simply known as the Production Code or as the "Hays Code", was established both to curtail additional government censorship and to prevent the loss of revenue from boycotts led by the Catholic Church and fundamentalist Protestant groups, whom had wanted to judge the moral impact of cinematic Hollywood on the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shurlock|first=Geoffrey|date=1947-11|title=The Motion Picture Production Code|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000271624725400122|journal=The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=254|issue=1|pages=140–146|doi=10.1177/000271624725400122|issn=0002-7162}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of homosexuality, the code marked the end of the "pansy" characters and the beginning of depictions that were more reserved and buried within subtext.&lt;ref name="benshoff" /&gt; While the code did not explicitly state homosexuality as against the code, the code stated no kind of sex perversion, which homosexuality fell under at the time, labeling them as sexual deviants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.11126/stanford/9780804784207.001.0001|title=Better Left Unsaid|last=Gilbert|first=Nora|date=2013-01-09|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804784207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the code stating that homosexuality was sex perversion, homosexuals came to also be represented as villains or victims, that commit crimes due to their homosexuality.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noriega|first=Chon|date=|title=Something's Missing Here!: Homosexuality and Film Reviews during the Production Code Era|url=|journal=Cinema Journal|volume=30|pages=22-41|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per the production code these homosexual villains would have to be punished by the law in order to coincide with the production code’s rule stating that films not place crime about law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=7. The Production Code|date=2008-01-31|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3138/9781442688636-008|work=Miracles and Sacrilege|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9781442688636|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example for the enforcement of the production code is  the character Joel Cairo in the movie [[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|Maltese Falcon]]. in the original novel the character is clearly homosexual, however in the movie it is vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Raymond|title=Images in the Dark|date=January 1995|publisher=TLA Publications|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1-880707-01-2|page=501}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production code not only effected what was cut from movies containing homosexual character, but removed them completely. The stage play, [[The Children's Hour (play)|The Children’s Hour]] by Lillian Hellman was released as a film in 1936 called [[These Three]]. The stage play contained two teachers being accused of having a lesbian affair, yet the film created a heterosexual love triangle between two women and one man.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noriega|first=Chon|date=|title=Something's Missing Here!: Homosexuality and Film Reviews during the Production Code Era|url=|journal=Cinema Journal|volume=30|pages=22-41|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics came to favor the Production code as it allowed for unsavory behaviors to be eliminated from the public’s eye, one example included stage play [[The Children's Hour (play)|The Children’s Hour]] and the film [[These Three]]. Critics stated that the film was more enjoyable with the absence of the lesbian characters when compared to the original stage play.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;[[File:Glen or Glenda.jpg|thumb|Poster for ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'' (1953)]]

===Early gender-role reversals===
The time period prior to the "Hays Code" also included many gender role-reversal productions, notably [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[A Woman]]'' (1915), in which Chaplin dresses as a female and plays with the affection of various men.&lt;ref name="mangin"/&gt; Famous series of drag impersonations included [[Miss Fatty's Seaside Lovers|''Miss Fatty'']] (1915), featuring [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]], and ''[[Sweedie]]'' (1914–16), starring [[Academy Award]]-winning actor [[Wallace Beery]], created a comedic view of drag that many in the late 1910s and early 1920s could find entertaining. These depictions became rarer for mainstream commercial films with the establishment of the Hollywood Production Code.&lt;ref name="mangin"/&gt;
Various other notable drag films of the early to mid-1900s include: 
* ''[[A Florida Enchantment]]'' (1914), directed by and starring [[Sidney Drew]]
* ''[[Mabel's Blunder]]'' (1914), directed by and starring [[Mabel Normand]]
* ''[[Charley's Aunt (1915 film)|Charley's Aunt]]'' (1915), based on the [[Charley's Aunt|stage play]] and starring [[Oliver Hardy]]
* ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' (1930), starring [[Marlene Dietrich]], in which she performs a song in tuxedo and kisses another woman
* ''[[Queen Christina (film)|Queen Christina]]'' (1933), directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]] and starring [[Greta Garbo]]
*''[[Wonder Bar]]'' (1934) Features a brief, but explicit homosexual reference.
* ''[[Sylvia Scarlett]]'' (1936), starring [[Katharine Hepburn]], a widely unsuccessful film, but significant due to the female-to-male transformation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Noe |first=Denise |title=Can a woman be a man on-screen? |journal=The Gay and Lesbian Review |year=2001 |url=http://elibrary.bigchalk.com/elibweb/elib/do/document?set=search&amp;dictionaryClick=on&amp;secondaryNav=advance&amp;groupid=1&amp;requestid=lib_standard&amp;resultid=7&amp;edition=&amp;ts=11193F60E15507D8B65D46AAB005BF84_1354084924558&amp;start=1&amp;publicationId=&amp;urn=urn%3Abigchalk%3AUS%3BBCLib%3Bdocument%3B78969177 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[I Was a Male War Bride]]'' (1949), directed by [[Howard Hawks]] and starring [[Cary Grant]] as a French officer who must impersonate a female war bride
* ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'' (1953), a film by [[Ed Wood]] starring himself
* ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), featuring [[Tony Curtis]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Jack Lemmon]]

From 1950-56 [[Jerry Lewis]] appeared in several film remakes in roles originally written for women. He appeared in drag in the films [[At War With The Army]], [[Scared Stiff (1953 film)|Scared Stiff]], and [[Money From Home]] and routinely adopted “sissy” mannerisms and gender ambiguous role-playing with his partner [[Dean Martin]]. He was criticized by the press for his ‘prancing and mincing’ homosexual references.

===World War II era to 1960s===
During the Second World War and the subsequent Cold War, Hollywood increasingly depicted gay men and women as sadists, psychopaths, and nefarious, anti-social villains. These depictions were driven by the censorship of the code, which was willing to allow "sexual perversion" if it was depicted in a negative manner, as well as the fact that homosexuality was classified as a mental illness and gay men and women were often harassed by the police. This can be examined in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1948 film ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]''.&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mangin"/&gt; In his article "The History of Gays and Lesbians on Film", author Daniel Mangin explains:

: "In the film, Jimmy Stewart plays a dabbler in philosophy who introduces the two boys to the [[Great Man theory|"Superman" theory]] of the superiority of some humans over others. He becomes horrified when he realizes that the theories he espoused have led to murder. His character's somewhat hysterical repudiation of his formerly held beliefs mirrored the fears of some Americans about the infiltration of alien ideas. That the homosexuals in ''Rope'' were connected to the arts, as were many of those investigated, seems apt in view of longstanding suspicions about the politics and sexual practices of people so engaged."&lt;ref name="mangin"/&gt;

The censorship code gradually became liberalized 1950s–60s, until it was replaced by the current classification system established by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]. Legally, it was in the mid-1950s when the United States Supreme Court extended First Amendment legal protection to films, reversing its original verdict, and, in a second case, ended once common practice of film studios owning the cinemas. That practice had made it difficult for films produced outside of these studios, such as independent or international films, to be screened widely, let alone to be commercially successful.

Culturally, American consumers were increasingly less likely to boycott a film at the request of the Catholic Church or fundamentalist Protestant groups. This meant that films with objectionable content did not necessarily need the approval of the Hollywood Production Code or religious groups in order to be successful. As a result, Hollywood gradually became more willing to ignore the code in order to compete with television and the growing access to independent and international cinema.

During the 1950s–60s, gay characters in American films were identified with more overtly sexual innuendos and methods (e.g., reference in [[The Seven Year Itch]] to three male tenants who are "interior decorators or something"), but having a gay or bisexual sexual orientation was largely treated as a trait of miserable and suicidal misfits who frequently killed themselves or other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Richardson, Diane |editor2=Seidman, Steven |title=Handbook of Lesbian and Gay Studies |year=2009 |publisher=Sage Publications |isbn=9780761965114 |pages=339–54 |author1 =Gamson, Joshua |chapter=Sweating in the Spotlight: Lesbian, Gay and Queer Encounters with Media and Popular Culture }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this post-war era, mainstream American cinema might advocate tolerance for eccentric, sensitive young men, wrongly, accused of homosexuality, such as in the film adaptation of ''[[Tea and Sympathy (film)|Tea and Sympathy]]'' (1956), but gay characters were frequently eliminated from the final cut of the film or depicted as dangerous misfits who would fall prey to a well-deserved violent end.

The film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia]]'', widely seen as one of the best films ever created, was revolutionary for several reasons including depicting not only a character who is heavily implied to be gay, but also implying a relationship between two men. Though [[T.E. Lawrence]]'s sexuality remains ambiguous, director [[David Lean]] had [[Peter O'Toole]] play his version of the desert hero as a gay man. Beyond this, Lean also implied a relationship between Lawrence and his companion Sherif Ali, played by [[Omar Sharif]]. Years later, when asked about the homosexuality in his hit film, Lean commented, "Throughout, Lawrence was very, if not entirely, homosexual. We thought we were being very daring at the time: Lawrence and Omar..." This is one of the first examples of an LGBT+ film being a box office success without an incredible amount of innuendo to disguise the homosexual nature of the film.

The 1965 film ''[[Inside Daisy Clover]]'', based on the novel of the same name, was one of the first mainstream American films during the 1950s–60s to depict an expressly gay or bisexual character who, while forced to marry a woman for his career, is not uncomfortable with his sexual orientation and does commit suicide or fall victim to murder. Yet, beyond a few lines of dialogue, the character's bisexuality was largely restricted to bits of subtext and innuendo.

In America, efforts at creating complex gay or bisexual film characters were largely restricted to people such as [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Kenneth Anger]]. Beyond their underground, independent films, a handful of foreign films were depicting gay characters as complex human beings entitled to tolerance, if not equality. However, mainstream American cinema efforts at marketing films for a LGBT audience did not begin until the 1970s.

==After Stonewall==
Following the 1969 [[Stonewall riots]] in New York City (a major turning point in the LGBT-rights movement), Hollywood began to look at gay people as a possible consumer demographic. It was also in the 1970s, that some anti-gay laws and prejudicial attitudes changed through the work of an increasingly visible LGBT-rights movement and overall attitudes in America about human sexuality, sex and gender roles changed as a result of LGBT-rights, [[feminist movement|women's liberation]] and the [[sexual revolution]].

''[[The Boys in the Band]]'' (1970) was the first attempt of Hollywood to market a film to gay consumers and present an honest look at what it meant to be a gay or bisexual man in America. The film based on a play of the same name, was often hailed in the mainstream press as a presenting a "landmark of truths", but was often criticized for reinforcing certain anti-gay stereotypes and for failing to deal with LGBT-rights and showing a group of gay and bisexual men who are all unhappy, miserable and bitchy.

In contrast, ''[[Fortune and Men's Eyes]]'' (1971), was co-produced by MGM, dealt with the issue of homosexuality in prison, and depicted gays in a relatively "open and realistic, non-stereotypical and non-caricatured manner".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Fortune%20and%20Men%27s%20Eyes&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the criticism and setbacks with the Boys in the Band film, the treatment of homosexuality in mainstream American film did, gradually, improve during the 1970s, especially if the film was directed at a gay audience (i.e. ''[[A Very Natural Thing]]'' (1973)), or a more cosmopolitan-liberal audience (i.e. ''[[Something for Everyone]]'' (1970), ''[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (film)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]'' (1971), ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' (1972) and ''[[Ode to Billy Joe (film)|Ode to Billy Joe]]'' (1976)).&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;

Despite the growing tolerance of homosexuality during the 1970s, some Hollywood films throughout the decade still depicted homosexuality as an insult or a joke. Gay characters were sometimes depicted in mainstream films as dangerous misfits who needed to be cured or killed. Some films would even use anti-gay derogatory comments, often made by the protagonist, in a manner that was not done in Hollywood films with regards to other minority groups.  Films like ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]]'' (1980) and  ''[[Windows (film)|Windows]]'', for example, portrayed gays in an unrelentingly negative light.

The slowly growing acceptance of homosexuality in film continued into the early 1980s, with the addition of two new factors; the rising political clout of Christian fundamentalist groups, committed to a conservative, traditionalist social and economic agenda, and the emergence of the [[HIV/AIDS]] pandemic.

===Following decades===
In the mid-1980s, an organized religious-political movement arose in America to oppose LGBT rights. The political clout of the "religious right", as it became known, grew as its role in helping to elect, mostly, Republican Party candidates and move the party further to the political right.

As a result, a Hollywood film in the mid-1980s that depicted gay people as being complex human beings entitled to their rights and dignity was a potential commercial liability and was at risk of a boycott from the stronghold conservative, right wing movement. Throughout the 1980s, if a Hollywood film was not made, primarily, for a gay audience or a cosmopolitan–liberal audience, homosexuality was often depicted as something to laugh at, pity or fear.

Along with clout of fundamentalist Christian groups, the Hollywood's treatment of homosexuality and gay characters was also shaped by the emergence of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Ignorance about the disease, and how it was spread, was commonplace and the fact that many of the early American victims were gay or bisexual men helped to fuel the myth that gave the disease its first name; GRID (Gay Related Immune Disorder).

As mainstream American films began to depict or make reference to the pandemic, the ignorance about the disease, including the idea that if one is gay, then they must have AIDS, spread.&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;&lt;ref name="benshoff"/&gt; The first American film about the pandemic, and the ignorance and homophobia that it promoted, was an independent film, ''[[Parting Glances]]'' (1986). It was followed by a mainstream television movie, ''[[An Early Frost]]'' (1985), but the first mainstream Hollywood film about the pandemic, and its impact on the gay community, would be released at the end of the decade; ''[[Longtime Companion]]'' (1989), followed up by ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'' (1993) a few years later.

All of these initial films and television movies about the pandemic followed a similar demographic pattern in that person living with AIDS was a white man from a middle-class or upper-class family, who was usually somber and emotional.&lt;ref name="green"/&gt; Though, homosexual characters and the disease were often shown in a negative light, they were also shown together as something manageable and "okay".&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;

In the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the cultural and political backlash that had occurred against gay people and gay rights issues began to decline, impacting how Hollywood treated LGBT-issues. The clout of Christian fundamentalist had its limits; in 1988, [[Pat Robertson]], a prominent Christian fundamentalist, ran for president in the Republican Party primary and was soundly defeated. During the decade, more LGBT people had come out, including celebrities and politicians and the AIDS-HIV pandemic had forced the broader society to more openly talk about human sexuality, including homosexuality.

A younger, "queerer" generation of gay people were not only coming out at younger ages, but becoming involved in helping to build what became known, in the early – mid-1990s, as "Queer Cinema".&lt;ref name="Buffalo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinemaqueer.com/review%20pages/longtime.html |title=Proud |work=[[Media in Buffalo, New York#Newspapers|Outcome Buffalo]] |author=Michael D. Klemm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern-day film==
[[New Queer Cinema]] of the 1990s represented a new era of independent films. Often directed and or written by openly gay people they featured mostly LGBT characters who were open about their sexual orientation or gender identity and oftentimes openly rejected both homophobia (and transphobia) as well as the idea that all LGBT characters in film needed to be "positive" or politically correct role models.

Alongside these independent films, mainstream Hollywood increasingly began to treat homosexuality as a normal part of human sexuality and gay people as a minority group, entitled to dignity and respect. Overt bigotry against gay people on screen became akin to overt racism, sexism or anti-Semitism. [[A-list]] Hollywood stars were more eager to play a gay character in a film.

Initially, most of these Hollywood depictions were in the context of campy, funny characters, often in drag on some sort of adventure or farce, while teaching a lesson in tolerance, if not equality.&lt;ref name="benshoff"/&gt; Drag portrayals also made a comeback in many films of the 1990s, notably ''[[The Birdcage]]'' (1996), starring [[Robin Williams]] and [[Nathan Lane]], ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' (1993), also starring Robin Williams, ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' (1994), starring [[Guy Pearce]], and ''[[To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar]]'' (1995), starring [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Wesley Snipes]], and [[John Leguizamo]].

While likable, decent gay characters were more common in mainstream Hollywood films, same-sex relationships, public displays of affection and intimacy were still generally taboo in mainstream Hollywood films. In the 1990s, the protagonist, or his best friend, in a Hollywood film could be LGBT, and a decent person, but, compared to heterosexual characters in films, the price of this progress was little to no on-screen same-sex intimacy or sexuality.

Outside of independent films or films made primarily for a gay audience, this trend did not really change in America until Ang Lee's ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005), which was a major benchmark in modern gay cinema.&lt;ref name="piontek"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Piontek |first=Thomas |title=Tears for Queers: Ang Lee's ''Brokeback Mountain'', Hollywood, and American Attitudes toward Homosexuality |journal=The Journal of American Culture |year=2012 |volume=35 |issue=2 |issn=1542-7331 |doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.2012.00802.x |pages=123–34 |pmid=22737731 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 25, 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first major motion pictures to feature a love story with two leading homosexual roles. The film provided a new mainstream outlook of homosexuality on film and in society. Other films such ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' (1999), ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'' (2003), ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' (2008), and ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'' (2010) all feature famous actors and actresses portraying homosexual characters searching for love and happiness in oppressive societies. It has become very frequent in modern cinema to see these types of lead roles being played by popular celebrities, which was quite rare decades before.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

As the gay rights movement still paves the way for LGBT acceptance in all different aspects in American society, it has clearly created the possibilities of seeing homosexual roles in everyday television and film. It is no longer a full-out moral issue to see two men or women fall in love, have fun, and be themselves on camera. Though it is still slightly controversial to create homosexual characters in leading roles, the public has grown comfortable and has progressed with improving the quality of gay themes and images.&lt;ref name="benshoff"/&gt;

==Facts==

Charles Katz used a public pay [[phone booth]] to transmit illegal [[gambling]] wagers from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Miami]] and [[Boston]]. Unbeknownst to Katz, the [[FBI]] was recording his conversations via an [[Covert listening device|electronic eavesdropping device]] attached to the exterior of the phone booth. Katz was convicted based on these recordings. He challenged his conviction, arguing that the recordings were obtained in violation of his [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights. The Court of Appeals sided with the FBI because there was no physical intrusion into the phone booth itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Katz v. United States |vol=369 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=130 |pinpoint= |court=[[9th Cir.]] |date=1966 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/369/130/261303/ |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional issues of the case===
* Does the [[right to privacy]] extend to telephone booths and other public places?
* Is a physical intrusion necessary to constitute a search?

==Ruling==
*"The Government's activities in electronically listening to and recording the petitioner's words violated the privacy upon which he justifiably relied while using the telephone booth and thus constituted a 'search and seizure' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment." – Justice Stewart&lt;ref name=White&gt;White, Welsh S., and James J. Tomkovicz. ''Criminal Procedure: Constitutional Constraints upon Investigation and Proof''. Newark, NJ: LexisNexis Matthew Bender, 2004. (p. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Regardless of the location, a conversation is protected from unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment if it is made with a "reasonable expectation of privacy".
* Wiretapping counts as a search (physical intrusion is not necessary).

==Decision and rationale==
The Court ruled 7–1 in favor of Katz, with Justice Black in dissent. Justice Marshall did not participate in the vote. Writing for the majority, [[Potter Stewart|Justice Stewart]] wrote, "One who occupies [a telephone booth], shuts the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world."&lt;ref name=White/&gt; Certain details, such as shutting the door on the telephone booth, help determine if a person intends for a conversation to be private. Thus, private conversations can be made in public areas.

[[John Marshall Harlan II|Justice Harlan]]'s concurring opinion summarizes the essential holdings of the majority:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) that an enclosed telephone booth is an area where, like a home, and unlike a field, a person has a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy; (b) that electronic as well as physical intrusion into a place that is in this sense private may constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment; and (c) that an invasion of a constitutionally protected area by federal authorities is, as the Court has long held, presumptively unreasonable in the absence of a search warrant.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The majority opinion by Justice Stewart did not dispute that a magistrate "could constitutionally have authorized" the wiretap in this case, but, since such a warrant was neither sought nor obtained, the search was therefore unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schroeder |first=Steve |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XULAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127 |title=The Lure: The True Story of How the Department of Justice Brought Down Two of the World's Most Dangerous Cyber Criminals |page=127 |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Court said it was not recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment: "the protection of a person's general right to privacy—his right to be let alone by other people—is, like the protection of his property and of his very life, left largely to the law of the individual States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Candace |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=HV8hITArW9MC&amp;pg=PA41 |chapter=Challenges and Issues Today |title=Intellectual Freedom Manual |pages= 41–42 |publisher=American Library Association, Office for Intellectual Freedom |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Katz'' case made government wiretapping by both state and federal authorities subject to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=Leon |title=The Justices of the United States Supreme Court: Their Lives and Major Opinions |volume=V |publisher=Chelsea House |year=1978 |page=292 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXskAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justice Harlan's concurrence==
In a concurring opinion, Justice Harlan built upon the foundations of the majority opinion and formulated the "reasonable expectation" test for determining if a person should expect privacy in a given location. Harlan's test, not the majority opinion, is the most common formulation cited by courts. Later, this test was arranged into a two prong test for assessing the reasonableness of an expectation of privacy: If (1) the individual "has exhibited an actual (subjective) [[expectation of privacy]]", and (2) society is prepared to recognize that this expectation is (objectively) reasonable, then there is a right of privacy in the given circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://Stanford.edu/pdf/Freida-first-principled|title=First Principles of Communications Privacy|first=Susan|last=Freiwald|journal=Stanford Technology Law Review|year=2007|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This test was adopted by the majority in ''[[Smith v. Maryland]]'' (1979).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Smith v. Maryland]]'', {{ussc|442|735|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Harlan basically breaks down what this ruling means for future cases involving search and seizures.

==Justice Black's dissent==
In his case,  [[Hugo Black]] argued that the Fourth Amendment, as a whole, was only meant to protect "things" from physical search and seizure; it was not meant to protect personal privacy. Additionally, Black argued that the modern act of wiretapping was analogous to the act of eavesdropping, which was around even when the Bill of Rights was drafted. Black concluded that if the drafters of the Fourth Amendment had meant for it to protect against eavesdropping they would have included the proper language.

'''Keen Software House''' is an [[Indie game|independent]] [[Video game developer|video game developing company]] based in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]. The company was founded by [[Marek Rosa]] in 2010.

Keen Software House's technological know-how and proprietary VRAGE game engine has allowed the company to create games that leverage elements of science into the gameplay. The studio's first game, ''[[Miner Wars 2081]]'', focused on an open world with destructible terrain, while the second game, ''[[Space Engineers (video game)|Space Engineers]]'', presents volumetric physics as gameplay in a space-based environment focused on engineering, construction, and maintenance of space ships and stations. The company's proprietary VRAGE game engine powers both the titles, and is currently in iteration 2.0. Additionally, they have created a separate team charged with development of ''Medieval Engineers'' - utilitizing similar rendering styles, while adding in weight and block based destruction / deformation with physics based calculations set in medieval times. It offers both a single- and multiplayer experience including planets; from ''Space Engineers'' but with territory based grid system where clans can battle for ground to build on. Realistic mechanical contraptions such as catapults can be created to real-time damage structures.

=== ''Miner Wars 2081'' ===

The first big project for Keen Software House was Miner Wars 2081, which was presented at [[Game Developers Conference]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.gamershell.com/companies/keen_software_house/960250.html |title=Keen Software House - Press Release: Meet the Miner Wars Team at GDC in San Francisco(960250) |publisher=Gamershell.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game received mixed reviews by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/miner-wars-2081 |title=Miner Wars 2081 for PC Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hodnoceniher.cz/pc/akcni/miner-wars-2081.html |title=czech |publisher=Hodnoceniher.cz |date= |accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Miner Wars 2081'' is an action-survival space-shooter set in the year 2081, 10 years after the destruction of all planetary objects in the Solar System. The story introduces the player to many types of missions: rescue, exploration, revenge, base defense, theft, transportation, stealth, search and destroy, pure harvesting or racing.

==== Open source ====

The source code for ''[[Miner Wars 2081]]'' was released in March, 2013, under a commercial (non-copyright, restricted-use) license.&lt;ref name="2081github"&gt;{{cite web|title=Miner Wars 2081 on Github|url=https://github.com/KeenSoftwareHouse/Miner-Wars-2081|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The code may only be redistributed to allow for "mods" of the original game, and the code must continue to perform a license-ownership check.

=== ''Space Engineers'' ===
The studio's second project, ''[[Space Engineers (video game)|Space Engineers]]'', is a voxel-based sandbox game that launched on Steam Early Access in October 23, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/space-engineers-ndash-released-on-steam-early-access.html&lt;/ref&gt; and presents the player with an open world asteroid field wherein they can mine resources, build ships and stations, play with physics, and much more. ''Space Engineers'' is a sandbox game about engineering, construction and maintenance of space works.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/about1.html&lt;/ref&gt; The game sold more than 500,000 copies by May 6, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamershell.com/companies/keen_software_house/1311887.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''Space Engineers'' was well-received by both critics.

''Space Engineers'' is updated on a weekly basis based on stated development goals and community feedback.  Since launch has received major updates that include survival mode, multiplayer, dedicated server support and more. ''Space Engineers'' is open to community creation and modding.

On October 20, 2014, Keen Software House announced that ''Space Engineers'' has sold over 1,000,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/228152/SPACE_ENGINEERS_REACHES_ONE_MILLION_COPIES_SOLD.php&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2015, Keen Software House announced they are providing open access (but not making the game free) to the source code to accelerate mod development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.marekrosa.org/2015/05/space-engineers-full-source-code-access_40.html|website=Marek Rosa Blog|publisher=Marek Rosa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Medieval Engineers'' ===
On January 13, 2015, Keen Software House announced their third title and second engineering game named ''[[Medieval Engineers]]''.&lt;ref name="gamasutra.com"/&gt; It was also announced that the game will be available on Steam Early Access.

''Medieval Engineers'' is a sandbox game about engineering, construction and the maintenance of architectural works and mechanical equipment using medieval technology. Players build cities, castles and fortifications; construct mechanical devices and engines; perform landscaping and underground mining.

''Medieval Engineers'' is inspired by real medieval technology and the way people survived and built architectural and mechanical works in medieval times. ''Medieval Engineers'' strives to follow the laws of physics and real history and does not use technologies that were not available from the 5th to the 15th century.

== VRAGE ==

Keen Software House developed and utilizes a video game engine called VRAGE. VRAGE stands for "volumetric rage" and/or "voxel rage".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keenswh.com/vrage.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The first iteration of VRAGE, VRAGE 1.0, was built and tailored specifically for Miner Wars 2081 and the game’s need for destructible voxel terrain and an open-world.  With the open source release in 2013 of Miner Wars 2081, the VRAGE 1.0 engine was also open sourced, under a restrictive commercial license.&lt;ref name="2081github" /&gt;  The second iteration of the engine, VRAGE 2.0 is currently in development and powers the studio's latest games, ''Space Engineers'' and ''Medieval Engineers''.

VRAGE 2.0's core feature is volumetricity within the environment.  Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity and can be assembled, disassembled, deformed and destroyed. Due to ''Medieval Engineers'' development, VRAGE received a fresh upgrade: structural integrity and DirectX 11 rendering.

'''Maria Philomena Potter''' (3 January 1925 – 7 April 2004), known as '''Maureen Potter''', was an [[Irish nationality|Irish]] [[singer]], [[actor]], [[comedian]] and [[performer]].

==Early life==
Potter was born in [[Dublin]] and educated at St. Mary's school in [[Fairview, Dublin|Fairview]]. She had a long career in Irish theatre, mainly as Ireland's première comedienne, but also as a straight actress. She was a regular performer at the [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin|Gaiety Theatre]] in Dublin and for many years starred in Christmas pantomime. She became the first star to have a bronze cast of her handprints outside the theatre.&lt;ref name="rte"&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2004/0407/47458-potter/ Maureen Potter]&lt;/ref&gt; She married Jack O'Leary in 1959, an Irish army officer whom she had first met in 1943, and he wrote most of her comedic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0693322/bio|title=Maureen Potter|website=IMDb|access-date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career ===
Among Potter's many dramatic roles in the theatre was that of Maisie Madigan in ''[[Juno and the Paycock]]''. While still a teenager, she toured abroad before [[World War II]] as a singer and dancer with [[Jack Hylton]] (known as Jack Haylton and his orchestra). On a tour of Germany, they once performed in front of [[Adolf Hitler]] and other [[Nazism|Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2004/0407/potter.htm Obituary of Maureen Potter]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; She played the role of Dante Riordan in [[Joseph Strick]]'s film, ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (film)|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (1977). In September 1938, Potter appeared on the BBC Television Service with Jack Hylton and his Band. Film of her performance is held by the Alexandra Palace Television Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apts.org.uk Alexandra Palace Television Society]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Archivist of the Alexandra Palace Television Society gave Potter a copy of her 1938 television appearance, and she recalled her memories:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"I was 13 years of age when I appeared with the Jack Hylton Band in RadiOlympia, a programme that went out on television all those years ago. What I remember most is the heavy ochre make-up the performers had to wear. I was excused the make-up for some reason; maybe mine was such a long shot that it was not deemed necessary. If you blink you miss me! However, June Malo, the Henderson Twins, [[Peggy Dell]], Bruce Trent and Freddie Schweitzer had this heavy ochre make-up plastered on them. Plastered is the only word! Having toured with them for over 12-months and used to seeing them in stage make-up they looked very strange. Mr Hylton was excused also. He was always Mr Hylton to me. He called me "Morine", (the American pronunciation, and was a kind man who made such a difference to my career. He always wore those two-tone shoes that were so popular at the time. It is wonderful to see him so trim and dapper in the tape, which Simon Vaughan has sent me."&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Potter letter to APTS Archivist - March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|0z1iLiTuV1M|APTS footage containing interview with Maureen Potter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Later life and death ==
{{external media|align=right|width=180px|image1 = [http://www.photopol.com/signs/maureen_potter_grave_xmas.jpg Potter's gravestone at St. John the Baptist cemetery in Clontarf]}}
Potter first appeared professionally with [[Jimmy O'Dea]] in pantomime and appeared frequently on television and in cabaret. She was conferred with the Freedom of the City of [[Dublin]] in 1984, and was later awarded an honorary degree from [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. She died in her sleep at her home in [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]] on 7 April 2004, at the age of 79. She was survived by her husband, Jack O'Leary and her sons, John and Hugh.

'''Mobile television''' is [[television]] watched on a small [[handheld]] or mobile device. It includes [[pay TV]] service delivered via [[mobile phone]] networks or received [[free-to-air]] via [[terrestrial television]] stations. Regular broadcast standards or special mobile TV transmission formats can be used. Additional features include [[download]]ing [[TV program]]s and [[podcast]]s from the Internet and storing programming for later viewing.

According to the ''Harvard Business Review'', the growing adoption of [[smartphones]] allowed users to watch as much mobile video in three days of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] as they watched throughout the entire [[2008 Summer Olympics]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;an increase of 564%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/31/4-ways-smartphones-save-tv/ Looking for TV Genius? | Red Bee Media]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430000855/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/31/4-ways-smartphones-save-tv/ |date=April 30, 2011 }}[http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/31/4-ways-smartphones-save-tv/ &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] &lt;/ref&gt;

Early mobile television receivers were based on the old [[analog television]] signal system. They were the earliest televisions that could be placed in a coat pocket. The first was the Panasonic IC TV MODEL TR-001, introduced in 1970. The second was sold to the public by [[Clive Sinclair]] in January 1977. It was called the Microvision or the [[MTV-1]]. It had a two-inch (50&amp;nbsp;mm) [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] screen and was also the first television which could pick up signals in multiple countries. It measured 102×159×41&amp;nbsp;mm and was sold for less than [[Pounds sterling|£]]100 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and for around [[US dollar|$]]400 in the [[United States]]. The project took over ten years to develop and was funded by around £1.6 million in British government grants.&lt;ref name="Clive's achievements"&gt;[http://www.sinclair-research.co.uk/about-srl.php Clive's achievements] [[Sinclair Research]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Video and TV gear"&gt;[http://www.retrothing.com/video_tv/index.html Video and TV gear], [[Retrothing.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In later decades the term "mobile television" was associated with mobile telephones and other mobile digital devices. Mobile TV is among the features provided by many 3G phones.

&lt;!-- The following paragraph is a huge, convoluted mess. The sources don't agree with the prose. Do we really need every carrier listed? How can South Korea be first to have MTV in 2005 when the sentence before said they had it in 2002? etc. --AlanM1--&gt;
In 2002, South Korea became the first country in the world to have a commercial mobile TV by CDMA IS95-C network, and mobile TV over 3G ([[CDMA2000]] 1X EVDO) also became available in that same year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1036976/korean-mobile-content-kings-spill-beans&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, South Korea became the first country in the world to have mobile TV. It started satellite DMB (S-DMB) and terrestrial DMB (T-DMB) services on May 1 and December 1. Today, [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] are at the forefront of this developing sector.&lt;ref&gt;NYTimes.com via Yahoo! Finance: [http://biz.yahoo.com/nytimes/080506/1194771946810.html?.v=18 Mobile TV Spreading in Europe and to the U.S.], May 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile TV services were launched by the operator CSL during March 2006 in Hong Kong on the 3G network.&lt;ref&gt;3G UK: The service is based on the [http://www.3g.co.uk/PR/March2006/2732.htm Golden Dynamic Enterprises Ltd.]'s [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_Dec_4/ai_n16881105 "VOIR Portal"] and follows the 3GPP standard 3G-324 M. The same service was also deployed to the Philippines in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Telecom|BT]] in the [[United Kingdom]] was among the first companies outside South Korea to launch mobile TV in September 2006, although the service was abandoned less than a year later.&lt;ref&gt;ZDnet: [http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/0,1000000085,39288247,00.htm BT ditches mobile TV service], 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The same happened to MFD Mobiles Fernsehen Deutschland, who launched their [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]]-based service June 2006 in Germany, and stopped it in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Broadband TV news: [http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/?p=4682 MFD hands back German T-DMB licence], May 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Also in June 2006, mobile operator 3 in Italy (part of [[Hutchison Whampoa]]) launched their mobile TV service, but opposed to their counterpart in Germany this was based on [[DVB-H]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Register'': [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/28/dvbh_success_in_italy/ DVB-H rockets ahead in Italy], 28 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Sprint started offering the service in February 2006 and was the first US carrier to offer the service. In the US [[Verizon Wireless]] and more recently [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]] are offering the service.

In South Korea, mobile TV is largely divided into satellite DMB ([[S-DMB]]) and terrestrial DMB ([[T-DMB]]). Although S-DMB initially had more content, T-DMB has gained much wider popularity because it is free and included as a feature in most mobile handsets sold in the country today.

==Challenges==
Mobile TV usage can be divided into three classes:
* "Fixed"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;watched while not moving, possibly moved when not being watched
* "Nomadic"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;watched while moving slowly (e.g. walking)
* "Mobile"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;watched when moving quickly (e.g. in a car)

Each of these pose different challenges.

===Device manufacturers' challenges===
&lt;!--No explanation for these, and no source. I'm going with something generic for now
* Power consumption&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;battery technology for mobile portable devices may be stuck in a race condition. Improved battery life can be used up by the upgraded mobile content and enhanced functions. However, [[dashtop mobile]] devices can also be powered by a 12-volt vehicle battery, however vehicle batteries are not a sustainable source of power for mobile devices. --AlanM1--&gt;
* Power consumption&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;continuous receipt, decoding, and display of video requires continuous power, and cannot benefit from all of the types of optimizations that are used to reduce power consumption for data and voice services.
* Memory&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;to support the large buffer requirements of mobile TV. Currently available{{when|date=August 2012}} memory capabilities are not suited for long hours of mobile TV viewing. Furthermore, potential future applications like [[peer-to-peer video sharing]] in mobile phones and consumer broadcasting would add to the increasing memory requirements{{why?|date=August 2012}}. The existing P2P algorithms are not expected to be enough for mobile devices, necessitating the advent of [[mobile P2P]] algorithms{{why?|date=August 2012}}. There is one start-up technology that claims [[patent]]ability on its mobile P2P, but has not drawn attention from device manufacturers yet.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

&lt;!--What does this have to do with UI design?
* [[User interface]] design&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;a large number of mobile phones do not support mobile TV; users have to purchase new handsets with improved LCD display and user interface that support mobile TV. This new design has to appeal to the end-users and increase the clarity of images without making the handset very bulky. The wider LCD touchscreens has been preferred by end-users and the iPhone's popularity in the United States is part of the compelling evidence. --AlanM1--&gt;
* Display&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;larger and higher-resolution displays are necessary for an optimal viewing experience.
* Processing power&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;significantly more processor performance is required for mobile TV than that used for UI and simple applications, like browsers and messaging.

==Digital television==

===North America===
{{As of|2012|01}}, there were 120 stations in the United States broadcasting using the [[ATSC-M/H]] "Mobile DTV" standard&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;a mobile and handheld enhancement to the HDTV standard that improves handling of [[multipath interference]] while mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OMVC announces sizable growth in number of MDTV stations at CES|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/RF/OMVC-mobile-DTV-presence-announces-growth-CES-01192012/index.html|website=Broadcast Engineering|accessdate=18 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922040843/http://broadcastengineering.com/RF/OMVC-mobile-DTV-presence-announces-growth-CES-01192012|archivedate=22 September 2012|date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- I don't know what this means. Seems like it's talking about audio, not video.

The FCC also chose [[HD Radio]] which uses COFDM and has reasonable mobile reception, does not have provisions for mobile TV as [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]]-T has with [[DMB-T]] and is incompatible even with neighboring [[Canada]], where the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) already chose DAB in the [[L band]]. --AlanM1--&gt;

The defunct [[MediaFLO]] used [[COFDM]] broadcast on [[UHF]] [[TV channel]] 55. Like satellite TV, it was [[encrypt]]ed and controlled by [[conditional access]] (provided via the [[cellular network]]). It required a [[Pay TV|subscription]] for each mobile device, and was limited to the [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] or [[Verizon Wireless]] networks.

===Broadcast mobile DTV development===
&lt;!--Another section in extreme need of a trim --AlanM1--&gt;
While MediaFLO used the TV spectrum and [[MobiTV]] used [[Mobile phone|cell phone]] networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mobitv.com/technology/managed-service-platform |title=mobile tv cell phone networks: |last=Thompson |first=Mark |date=2010-06-03 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2010-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515184507/http://www.mobitv.com/technology/managed-service-platform |archivedate=May 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "mobile DTV" (ATSC-M/H) used the [[digital TV]] spectrum.

At the April 2007 [[National Association of Broadcasters|National Association of Broadcasters (NAB)]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], the [[ATSC]] and [[8VSB]] methods for delivering mobile DTV were shown. [[A-VSB|Advanced VSB (A-VSB)]], from [[Samsung Group|Samsung]] and [[Rohde &amp; Schwarz]], was shown at the April 2006 show. In 2007, [[Zenith Electronics]], owned by [[LG Group|LG]], came up with 8VSB, which was introduced with [[Harris Corporation|Harris Group]]'s) [[MPH (ATSC)|Mobile-Pedestrian-Handheld (MPH)]] system.

As the broadcast networks began making their content available online, mobile DTV meant stations would have to find another way to compete. [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] tested A-VSB in the fall of 2006. Their stations [[KVCW]] and [[KSNV|KVMY]] were participating in the mobile DTV [[product demonstration|products demonstrations]] at the NAB show. A-VSB had worked in [[bus]]es at the 2007 [[Consumer Electronics Show]].

[[ION Media Networks]] started a test station on channel 38, which was to be used for digital [[LPTV]], which used a [[single-frequency network|single-frequency network (SFN)]]. In some areas, more than one [[TV transmitter]] would be needed to cover all areas. Mobile DTV could have been used at that time because it would not affect [[HDTV]] reception. A single standard, however, had to be developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/108538-NAB_Mobile_DTV_Hits_the_Strip.php|title=NAB: Mobile DTV Hits the Strip|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2007-04-14 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2009, the first [[prototype]] devices from LG and other manufacturers were demonstrated, including receivers for cars from [[Kenwood Corporation|Kenwood]], [[Visteon]] and [[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi]]. It was announced that 63 stations in 22 markets would debut the service in 2009. [[Gannett Broadcasting]] president David Lougee pointed out that many of those attending the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration of Barack Obama]] would likely hear him but not see him; had the new technology been in place, this would not have been a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/161893-CES_Broadcasters_Mobile_DTV_Moment.php?rssid=20102&amp;q=broadcasters+mobile+dtv+moment|title=CES: Broadcasters' Mobile DTV Moment|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-01-11 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, the [[Open Mobile Video Coalition]], made up of over 800 broadcast stations, selected four test stations: Gannett's [[WATL (TV)|WATL]], ION's [[WPXA-TV]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Fisher Communications|Fisher Communications']] [[KOMO-TV]], and [[Belo]]'s [[KONG-TV]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]. WPXA had begun mobile DTV broadcasting on April 1. The others would begin in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/209447-NAB_2009_Broadcasters_Set_Mobile_DTV_Test_Markets.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=broadcasters+set+mobile+dtv+test+markets|title=NAB 2009: Broadcasters Set Mobile DTV Test Markets|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-04-20 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2009, ION said HDTV, [[Digital terrestrial television|standard definition]] and mobile DTV streams were now available using its affiliates in [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] The "triple-play" concept was part of an effort to create a mobile DTV standard. At the time, only those with prototype receivers could pick up the streams.

ION chairman and CEO Brandon Burgess said mobile DTV lets stations "think beyond the living room and bring live television and real time information to consumers wherever they may be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/307120-ION_Broadcasts_Mobile_DTV_in_N_Y_D_C_.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=ION Broadcasts Mobile DTV in N.Y., D.C.: Hails Its Digital TV "Triple Play"|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-06-29 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Advanced Television Systems Committee started work on mobile DTV standards in May 2007, and manufacturers and sellers worked quickly to make the new technology a reality. The [[OMVC]] persuaded LG and Samsung to work together starting in May 2008 so that differing systems (possibly a self-destructing format war) would not delay or kill the technology.

Early in July 2009, the ATSC Technology and Standards Group approved the [[ATSC-M/H]] standard for mobile DTV which all members green-lighted October 15. The public could be using the new devices by 2010, though watching TV on [[cell phone]]s seemed unlikely in the near future since telephone manufacturers did not yet include that capability. The technology was expected to be used for [[Opinion poll]]s and even voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/307463-Mobile_DTV_is_Almost_Official.php?rssid=20065&amp;q=digital+tv |title=ATSC-M/H voted to proposed standard status |last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-07-06 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=october&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/358341-Mobile_DTV_Standard_Approved.php?rssid=20292&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Mobile DTV Standard Approved|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-10-16 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, the ATSC and the [[Consumer Electronics Association]] began identifying products meeting the standard with "MDTV".&lt;ref name=mdtv&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/440764-ATSC_Launches_Certification_Program_For_Mobile_DTV.php?rssid=20102&amp;q=digital+tv

Paul Karpowicz, NAB Television Board chairman and president of Meredith Broadcast Group, said &lt;blockquote&gt;"This milestone ushers in the new era of digital television broadcasting, giving local TV stations and networks new opportunities to reach viewers on the go. This will introduce the power of local broadcasting to a new generation of viewers and provide all-important emergency alert, local news and other programming to consumers across the nation."&lt;ref name=october/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later in July, the first multi-station tests began in [[Washington, D.C.]], while single stations in [[New York (city)|New York City]] and [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] already offered mobile DTV. The OMVC chose Atlanta's WATL and Seattle's KONG as "model stations" where product testing could take place. Seventy stations in 28 [[media market]]s planned streams by the end of 2009. All of the stations would have two or more channels each, with "[[electronic program guide|electronic service guide]] and alert data" among the services.

Twenty sellers of equipment would use these stations to test using the existing standard, but testing the final standard would come later, and tests by the public would happen in 2010, when many more devices would be ready.  Manufacturing large numbers of the devices could not take place without the final standard. LG, however, began mass-producing chips in June. ION technology vice president Brett Jenkins said, "We're really at a stage like the initial launch of DTV back in 1998. There are almost going to be more transmitters transmitting mobile than receive devices on the market, and that's probably what you'll see for the next six to nine months."&lt;ref name=Special/&gt;

Devices would eventually include [[USB]] dongles, [[netbook]]s, [[Portable DVD Player|portable DVD players]] and in-car displays.&lt;ref name=Special&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/314792-Special_Report_Mobile_DTV_Heats_Up.php |title=Special Report: Mobile DTV Heats Up |last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-07-13 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White House officials and members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] saw the triple-play concept in an ION demonstration on July 28, 2009 in conjunction with the OMVC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/316065-ION_OMVC_Organize_DTV_Showcase_in_D_C_.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=ION, OMVC Organize DTV Showcase in D.C.|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-07-22 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LIN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/326796-LIN_TV_Develops_Blackberry_App_For_Mobile_TV_Service.php?q=digital+tv |title=LIN TV Develops Blackberry App For Mobile TV Service|last=Eggerton |first=John |date=2009-08-07 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another demonstration took place October 16, 2009 with journalists, industry executives and broadcasters riding around Washington, D.C. in a bus with prototype devices. Included were those who would be testing the devices in the Washington and Baltimore markets in January 2010.&lt;ref name=tour&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/358415-OMVC_Does_Mobile_DTV_Tour.php?rssid=20103&amp;q=digital+tv |title=OMVC Does Mobile DTV Tour |last=Eggerton |first=John |date=2009-10-16 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progress==
{{primary sources|date=August 2015}}
{{overly detailed|section|date=April 2014}}
On August 7, 2009, [[BlackBerry]] service began on six TV stations. Eventually 27 other stations are expected to offer the service. By October, 30 stations were airing mobile DTV signals, and that number is expected to grow to 50. Also in the same month, FCC chair Julius Genachowski announced an effort to increase the spectrum available to wireless services.&lt;ref name=october/&gt;
Also in August, [[WTVE]] and [[Axcera]] began testing a [[single-frequency network]] (SFN) with multiple transmitters using the new mobile standard. The [[WRNN-TV|RNN]] affiliate in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]] had used this concept since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/441031-WTVE_Tests_SFN_For_Mobile_DTV.php?rssid=20065&amp;q=digital+tv|title=WTVE Tests SFN For Mobile DTV|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-12-18 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Mertz of Cavell, Mertz &amp; Associates says VHF will not work as well for mobile DTV because a 15-inch antenna or some other solution would be required, although he has heard from people who had no problems. An amplified antenna or higher power for the transmitting station would likely be needed, as well as [[Broadcast relay station|repeater stations]] where terrain is a problem.&lt;ref name=Jessell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/articles/2009/09/24/daily.2/ |title=Digital VHF Needs A Power Boost |last=Jessell|first=Harry A.|work=TVNewsCheck|date=2009-09-24|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lougee, whose company planned testing in its 19 markets in 2010, said the [[Computer chip|chip]] designs with the new devices made [[targeted advertising]] possible.&lt;ref name=tour/&gt;

In December 2009, Concept Enterprises introduced the first mobile DTV tuner for automobiles. Unlike earlier units, this one provides a clear picture without pixelation in a fast-moving vehicle, using an LG M/H chip and a one-inch roof-mounted antenna. No subscription is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.twice.com/article/388144-First_Mobile_DTV_Car_Tuner_At_499.php/|title=First Mobile DTV Car Tuner At $499|last=Gilroy|first=Amy|work=[[Twice (magazine)|TWICE]]|date=2009-11-09|accessdate=2009-11-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112153057/http://www.twice.com/article/388144-First_Mobile_DTV_Car_Tuner_At_499.php|archivedate=2009-11-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in December, the [[Consumer Electronics Association]] hosted a "plugfest" in Washington, D.C. to allow manufacturers to test various devices. More than 15 companies, and engineers from different countries, tested four transmission systems, 12 receiver systems, and four software types.&lt;ref name=mdtv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/394993-Mobile_DTV_Picks_Up_Speed.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv

On December 1, [[News Corp.]] chairman [[Rupert Murdoch]] said mobile DTV would be important to the future of all journalism, and he planned to offer TV and possibly [[newspaper]] content in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/391233-Murdoch_Says_Mobile_TV_Is_Key_to_Future.php?rssid=20070&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Murdoch Says Mobile TV Is Key to Future|last=Eggerton|first=John|date=2009-12-01|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the January 2010 Consumer Electronics Show, NAB head [[Gordon H. Smith]] disputed the idea that broadcasting's days were numbered, calling mobile DTV the proof over-the-air television would continue its popularity. He said people would use cell phones and other devices to watch, and broadcast technology would be the best way to do this. [[Wireless broadband]], which some wanted to replace broadcasting, would not be able to handle the demand for video services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/442953-CES_2010_Broadcasters_Tout_Mobile_DTV_Progress.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=CES 2010: Broadcasters Tout Mobile DTV Progress

He also explained to the FCC that mobile DTV was the best method for sending out live video to those using cell phones and similar devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/444575-FCC_s_Bellaria_Says_Broadcasters_Lobbying_Against_Scenario_That_s_No_Longer_On_Table.php?rssid=20103&amp;q=digital+tv

The [[OMVC]]'s Mobile DTV Consumer Showcase began May 3, 2010, and lasted all summer. Nine stations planned to distribute 20 programs, including local and network shows as well as cable programs, to [[Samsung Moment]] phones. [[Dell Netbooks]] and Valups Tivits also received programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mobile DTV's Real-World Test|first=Glen|last=Dickson|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2010, Media General began its first MDTV service at [[WCMH-TV]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] and had plans to do the same a month later at [[WFLA-TV]] in the [[Tampa Bay|Tampa Bay, Florida]] area and five to seven more stations in its portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/458539-Media_General_Expands_MDTV_Services.php|title=Media General Expands MDTV Services|first=George|last=Winslow|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2010-10-18|accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2010, a joint venture of 12 major broadcasters known as the [[Mobile Content Venture|Mobile Content Venture (MCV)]] announced plans to upgrade TV stations in 20 markets representing 40 percent of the United States population to deliver live video to portable devices by the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/eng/omvc-welcomes-mobile-content-venture-plans-upgrade-stations-mobile-video-delivery-20101124/|title=OMVC welcomes Mobile Content Venture plans to upgrade stations for mobile video delivery|last=Kurz|first=Phil|work=[[Broadcast Engineering]]|date=2010-11-22|accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Lawlor, a [[E. W.

In January 2012, the MCV announced that [[MetroPCS]] would offer MCV's Dyle mobile DTV service. [[Samsung]] planned an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phone capable of receiving this service late in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/478677-Tech_You_Need_to_See.php |title=Tech You Need to See |last=Winslow |first=George |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2012-01-09 |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2012, Dyle was in 35 markets and capable of reaching 55 percent of viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/491167-Mobilizing_the_TV_Business_Remains_a_Challenge.php|title=Mobilizing the TV Business Remains a Challenge |last=Winslow |first=George |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the home page on its website, "As of May 22, 2015, Dyle® mobile TV is no longer in service, and Dyle-enabled devices and their apps will no longer be supported."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dyle.tv|title=Dyle TV|website=Dyle.tv|accessdate=14 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012113823/http://www.dyle.tv/|archivedate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the NAB show in April 2012, MCV announced that 17 additional television stations would launch mobile DTV, bringing the total to 92, covering more than 55% of US homes. Included are stations in three new markets: [[Austin, Texas]], [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], and [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/483472-Mobilizing_for_Mobile_DTV.php |title=Mobilizing for Mobile DTV |last=Winslow |first=George |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2012-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, [[WRAL-TV]] announced rollout of a [[Mobile Emergency Alert System]] based around mobile digital television technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/news/0086/wral-tv-to-demo-mobile-eas/215408 TVTechnology: WRAL-TV to Demo Mobile EAS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A OTT technology platform called [[Syncbak]] enables smart phones and tablets rather than TV spectrum. Syncbak has been deployed across the United States at 55 major station groups, including FOX and CBS affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syncbak Makes Its Case for Mobile|last=Winslow |first=George |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2013, 130 stations were providing content, but adoption of devices such as [[dongle]]s was not widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/broadcasters-worry-zero-tv-homes-154357101--finance.html|title=Broadcasters worry about 'Zero TV' homes|last=Nakashima|first=Ryan|work=[[Associated Press]]|date=2013-04-07|accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While traditional pay TV operators and broadcast networks still dominate the consumer television landscape, new options are emerging, from subscription video on demand (SVOD), to electronic sell-through (EST), to free TV streaming. While SVOD drives the most online TV streams by far, the incidence of consumers who used SVOD and free streaming in 2012 was relatively equal. According to NPD’s “Free Streaming TV” report, released in February 2013, 12 percent of United States TV watchers reported streaming TV shows for free during the prior three months, compared to 14 percent who watched a TV show via SVOD.&lt;ref&gt;Free Streaming Making Inroads with Traditional Television Consumers from The [[NPD Group]]: https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/the-npd-group-free-streaming-making-inroads-with-traditional-television-consumers/&lt;/ref&gt;

"Over half of the viewers for streaming TV are between the ages of 18 and 34, so the YouTube generation is evolving from short-form and user-generated content to TV shows and, like YouTube, they can watch where and when they want," said Russ Crupnick, senior vice president of industry analysis at NPD. "Despite the attention lavished on tablets and phones, an astonishing 83 percent of free TV streaming programs are viewed on a computer."

'''''New Faces''''' was a [[British television]] [[talent show]] that aired in the 1970s and 1980s. It was presented originally by [[Derek Hobson]]. It was produced by [[Associated Television|ATV]] for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network.

==Original series: 1973–1978==
The show first aired as a pilot on 7 July 1973 and then as a full series from 29 September 1973 to 2 April 1978, it was recorded at the ATV Centre in [[Birmingham]]. The show was noted for its theme tune, "You're a Star!", performed by singer [[Carl Wayne]], formerly of [[The Move]], and it was eventually released, becoming a minor hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The precarious path of talent show fame|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=12 December 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16119375|accessdate=2011-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winners occasionally went on to greater success in television entertainment, like [[Lenny Henry]] the 1975 competition winner. Many top entertainers began their careers with a performance on this programme. The acts were evaluated by a panel of experts, including [[Tony Hatch]], [[Mickie Most]], Clifford Davis, [[Arthur Askey]], [[Ted Ray (comedian)|Ted Ray]], [[Ed Stewart]], [[Jack Parnell]], [[Alan A. Freeman]], [[Muriel Young]], [[Lonnie Donegan]], [[Lionel Blair]], [[Ingrid Pitt]], [[Shaw Taylor]], [[Terry Wogan]] and [[Noel Edmonds]].

Four judges would make up the panel each week.  Contestants received marks out of ten from the four judges in three categories such as "presentation", "content" and "star quality" – The "star quality" category was later replaced by "entertainment value". The highest score any act could attain was thus 120 points. [[Patti Boulaye]] was the only act who ever attained the maximum mark, doing so in the programme's final season. [[Les Dennis]] received 119 points, with only Tony Hatch giving him less than three perfect '10's'. Arthur Askey was on the same panel and started singing "Tony is a spoilsport" when Hatch awarded Dennis 9 as his final score.

==Revived version==
The series was revived by [[ITV Central|Central]] for three series between 1986 and 1988, presented by past winner, [[Marti Caine]]. Her catchphrase was bellowed at the voting studio audience: "Press your buttons... NOW!". The show also featured a panel of experts including the journalist [[Nina Myskow]], who often made critical comments. In this incarnation, the home audience decided who won by sending in postcards (phone voting was soon introduced by BBC rival ''[[Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series)|Bob Says Opportunity Knocks]]''), though, the audience did vote for its favourite act using a gigantic lightboard known as [[Gravelly Hill Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]] lighting up to a varying degree as they pushed their buttons.

The '''Old Nayong Pilipino''', officially the '''Nayong Pilipino Cultural Park''', was a cultural [[theme park]] near the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] in [[Pasay]], [[Metro Manila]].

==Operational history==
The organization that ran the theme park in Pasay, the Nayong Pilipino Foundation was established through Presidential Decree 37&lt;ref name=eyed&gt;{{cite news |last1=Santos |first1=Tina |title=Nayong Pilipino property eyed as Naia cargo area |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/224217/nayong-pilipino-property-eyed-as-naia-cargo-area |accessdate=30 May 2018 |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was issued by then-President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] on November 6, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Presidential Decree No. 37, s .1972 : Creating the Nayong Pilipino Foundation |url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1972/11/06/presidential-decree-no-37-s-1972/ |publisher=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=30 May 2018 |date=6 November 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme park itself, besides the [[Manila International Airport]] (now Ninoy Aquino International Airport) was opened in 1970.&lt;ref name="gulf"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nayong Pilipino is closing down |url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/general/nayong-pilipino-is-closing-down-1.380532 |accessdate=30 May 2018 |work=Gulf News |date=10 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme park proper covered an area of {{convert|22.3|ha|acre|sp=us}} while the whole property associated with the facility measures {{convert|45.9|ha|acre|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=eyed/&gt;

The theme park was closed in 2002, after a taxiway and service road was built on {{convert|9|ha|acre|sp=us}} of the facility for the Terminals 2 and 3 of the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]].&lt;ref name=eyed/&gt; The Tagalog Region, MIndanao Pavilion, Bohol area, and select Visayan sites such as the Magellan Cross were demolished.&lt;ref name="reopens"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Araneta |first1=Sandy |title=Nayong Pilipino re-opens today |url=https://www.philstar.com/metro/2004/12/12/267150/nayong-pilipino-re-opens-today |accessdate=30 May 2018 |work=The Philippine Star |date=12 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nayong Pilipino briefly opened again on December 12, 2004 after a {{Philippine peso|600 thousand}} clearing and renovation works. By this time among the attractions that still exists were the Bicol, Cordilleras, Ilocos regions, an aviary, a children's playground, a picnic area and some lagoons. The reopening was done in line with the Christmas season.&lt;ref name="reopens"/&gt; The park was later closed again but a Nayong Pilipino theme park was later opened at the [[Clark Freeport Zone]] in [[Pampanga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Torrevillas |first1=Domini |title=Nayong Pilipino to open  at Clark |url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2007/12/18/33931/nayong-pilipino-opennbsp-clark |accessdate=30 May 2018 |work=The Philippine Star |date=18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closure of the park was also deemed proper so as to avoid birdstrikes due to trees in the area.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The Manila International Airport Authority planned in 2012 to use the Nayong Pilipino property to expand the airport's cargo facility.&lt;ref name=eyed/&gt;

==Theme and attractions==
The Nayong Pilipino was conceptualized by then First Lady [[Imelda Marcos]] to be a cultural theme park showcasing [[Filipino culture]]. At its peak the park was divided into six different zones or "regions"; Ilocos, Cordillera, Tagalog, Bicol, Visayas and Mindanao.&lt;ref name="gulf"/&gt;

The theme park was touted as the first of its kind in Southeast Asia. It featured models of tourist destinations of the country such as the [[Mayon Volcano]] in [[Albay]] province, the [[Banaue Rice Terraces]] in the [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordilleras]], the historic houses of [[Vigan]], [[Ilocos Sur]], the [[Chocolate Hills]] of [[Bohol]], and the [[Magellan's Cross]] in [[Cebu]].&lt;ref name=eyed/&gt;

The Museum of Ethnology was also hosted within the theme park which features mannequins in ethnic attire.&lt;ref name="gulf"/&gt;

'''Operation Stormy Nights''' was an early major anti-[[Human trafficking|human-trafficking]] operation by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).&lt;ref name=Stone7&gt;Rhodes, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; It took place in [[Oklahoma]], [[United States]] and brought to light [[organized crime]] networks trafficking female [[Minor (law)|minors]] along [[United States Numbered Highways]], where the girls were [[Forced prostitution|forcibly prostituted]] to [[truck driver]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|page=248|title=Human Trafficking: A Global Perspective|author=Louise Shelley|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2010|isbn=1139489771}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Onset of the operation==
The operation was undertaken in 2004 and resulted in the release of 23 girls from [[Prostitution of children|child prostitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Human Trafficking in Oklahoma|publisher=Harrah Police Department|url=http://www.harrahpolicedept.com/Human-trafficking.html|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimps]] were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Oklahoma City Community College Pioneer|title=Human sex trafficking state issue|date=December 9, 2011|author=Morgan Beard|url=http://pioneer2010.occc.edu/index.php/features/60-feature/1671-human-sex-trafficking-state-issue|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these traffickers' victims were between 12 and 17 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]|title=Nightmare at the Truck Stop|author=Alex Tresniowski|date=May 1, 2006|volume=65|issue=17|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20062080,00.html|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lieutenant]] Alan Prince said that operations like Stormy Nights "are difficult because the girls are always on the move... and when you find them, it's hard to talk to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Topeka Capital-Journal]]|title=Sex trafficking charges filed|date=January 22, 2005|url=http://cjonline.com/stories/012205/kan_sextrafficing.shtml|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[sting operation]] was headed by FBI agent [[Mike Beaver (FBI agent)|Mike Beaver]], who was working as an [[Undercover operation|undercover agent]].&lt;ref name=Connecticut/&gt; 

==Sex trafficking== 
One of the human trafficking victims rescued in Stormy Nights was a girl named Angie.&lt;ref name=Stone7/&gt; Beaver called Angie "a normal, typical American teenager."&lt;ref name=Connecticut&gt;{{Cite AV media|title=Human Trafficking: Modern Day Slavery|date=April 17, 2013|publisher=[[Connecticut Public Radio]]|author=[[John Dankosky]]|url=http://www.yourpublicmedia.org/content/wnpr/human-trafficking-modern-day-slavery|accessdate=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angie, from [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]], was being [[Prostitution|prostituted]] with another girl, Melissa, in the [[Midwestern United States]].&lt;ref name=Stone8&gt;Rhodes, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; They were both teenagers at the time.&lt;ref name=Kansas/&gt; 

==Documented as a short film==
Angie was later interviewed in the [[documentary film]] ''[[Not My Life]]'', in which Angie explains how she and Melissa were expected to engage in [[sexual intercourse]] with truck drivers at a [[truck stop]] and [[Theft|steal]] their money. Angie said that, while looking through one of these drivers' wallets, she found pictures of the man's grandchildren and realized that he was old enough to be hers and Melissa's grandfather. She recounts this story disgustedly and almost crying, and says, "I wanted to die."&lt;ref name=Kansas&gt;{{Cite news|work=Kansas City infoZine|title=Lucy Liu and Others Advocate Against Trafficking Sex, Domestic Workers|author=Cindy Von Quednow|date=September 21, 2009|url=http://www.infozine.com/news/stories/op/storiesView/sid/37553/#|accessdate=August 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaver also appears in the film, saying, "It's not just truck drivers. We're seeing them purchased and abused by both white collar and blue collar individuals."&lt;ref name=Stone8/&gt; [[Robert Bilheimer]], the film's director, said that Angie did not fit the [[stereotype]] for a girl at risk of being sexually trafficked; she was from the [[Heartland (United States)|heartland]], attended a [[private school]] and, when her parents divorced, she began [[acting out]] as a way of [[Attention seeking|seeking attention]]. A man [[Child abduction|abducted]] her when she was 12 years old, violated the [[Mann Act]] by transporting her to another state, and began trafficking her sexually.&lt;ref name=Connecticut/&gt; While being trafficked, Angie was expected to engage in 40 sex acts every night, charging $50 for [[oral sex]], $60 for [[vagina]]l sex, and $70 for both.&lt;ref name=Stone7/&gt; Her trafficker threatened to kill her if she refused to perform these acts.&lt;ref name=Connecticut/&gt; Bilheimer said that the truck drivers Angie was expected to service either did not know or did not want to know what would happen to her if she did not give all of the money she earned to her pimp.&lt;ref name=Stone46/&gt; Another girl who was rescued in Stormy Nights, one of Angie's friends, was sent to a [[district attorney]] (DA) in order to facilitate the preparation of her [[testimony]], and the DA told the girl that he wouldn't talk to her until she had performed [[fellatio]] on him.&lt;ref name=Stone46/&gt; Bilheimer said that, while there is no way of being certain how many girls like Angie are being sexually trafficked, "diligent people out there have arrived at a bare minimum figure of... one hundred thousand girls, eight to fifteen [performing] ten sex acts a day" adding up to "a billion unpunished crimes of sexual violence on an annual basis." While Bilheimer interviewed Beaver at a Midwestern truck stop like the ones at which Angie was trafficked, someone wrote "Fuck you, asshole!" in the dirt on Beaver's car. Bilheimer said that this act demonstrated that many truck drivers hate law enforcement, although he said that "there are some good truckers out there,"&lt;ref name=Stone46&gt;Rhodes, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; like those who are part of [[Truckers Against Trafficking]], an [[List of organizations opposing human trafficking|organization opposing human trafficking]] by [[Consciousness raising|raising awareness]] on the subject among truck drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=''Not My Life'' Discussion Guide|publisher=World Without Genocide|url=http://worldwithoutgenocide.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Not-My-Life-Discussion-Guide.pdf|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When news of Stormy Nights was made public, there was a strong public response across the country, so the FBI established "Innocence Lost", a new department working to free children from prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[Oklahoma Gazette]]|title=Human network|author=C.G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64792">'''Phonofilm''' is an [[optical sound|optical]] [[sound-on-film]] system developed by inventors [[Lee de Forest]] and [[Theodore Case]] in the 1920s.

==Introduction==
In 1919 and 1920, Lee De Forest, inventor of the [[audion tube]], filed his first patents on a sound-on-film process, '''DeForest Phonofilm''', which recorded sound directly onto film as parallel lines. These parallel lines photographically recorded electrical waveforms from a microphone, which were translated back into sound waves when the movie was projected. Some sources say that DeForest improved on the work of Finnish inventor [[Eric Tigerstedt]] — who was granted German patent 309.536 on 28 July 1914 for his sound-on-film work — and on the [[Tri-Ergon]] process, patented in 1919 by German inventors Josef Engl, Hans Vogt, and Joseph Massole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/2064/Lee-de-Forest-and-Phonofilm-Virtual-Broadway.html Lee de Forest and Phonofilm at Virtual Broadway website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Phonofilm system, which recorded synchronized sound directly onto film, was used to record vaudeville acts, musical numbers, political speeches, and opera singers. The quality of Phonofilm was poor at first, improved somewhat in later years, but was never able to match the fidelity of [[sound-on-disc]] systems such as [[Vitaphone]], or later [[sound-on-film]] systems such as [[RCA Photophone]] or [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]] [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]].

The films of DeForest were [[short film]]s made primarily as demonstrations to try to interest major studios in Phonofilm. These films are particularly valuable to entertainment historians, as they include recordings of a wide variety of both well-known and less famous American [[vaudeville]] and British [[music hall]] acts which would otherwise have been forgotten. Some of the films, such as ''[[Curtiss JN-4|Flying Jenny Airplane]]'', ''Barking Dog'', and a film of DeForest himself explaining the Phonofilm system (all 1922) were experimental films to test the system.

Some of the people filmed included vaudevillians [[Joe Weber (vaudevillian)|Joe Weber]] and [[Lew Fields]], [[Eva Puck]] and [[Sammy White (actor)|Sammy White]], [[Eddie Cantor]], [[Ben Bernie]], [[Oscar Levant]], [[Phil Baker (comedian)|Phil Baker]], [[Frank McHugh]], [[Roy Smeck]], [[jazz]] musicians [[Noble Sissle]] and [[Eubie Blake]], "[[all-female band|all-girl]]" bandleader Helen Lewis, harmonicist [[Borrah Minevitch]], [[Nikita Balieff]]'s company [[La Chauve-Souris]], opera singers [[Eva Leoni]], [[Abbie Mitchell]], and [[Marie Rappold]], [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] stars [[Helen Menken]] and [[Fannie Ward]], folklorist [[Charles Ross Taggart]], [[Copla (music)|copla]] singer [[Concha Piquer]] (first Spanish sound film), and politicians [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]], [[Al Smith]], and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Smith and Roosevelt were filmed during the [[1924 Democratic National Convention]], held June 24 to July 9 at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. Coolidge became the first U. S. President to appear in a [[sound film|sound motion picture]] when DeForest filmed him at the [[White House]] on 11 August 1924.

In November 1922, De Forest founded the De Forest Phonofilm Corporation with studios at 314 East 48th Street in New York City, and offices at 220 West 42nd Street in the [[Candler Building (New York City)|Candler Building]]. However, DeForest was unable to interest any of the major [[Hollywood]] [[film studios|movie studios]] in his invention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/elizabeth-armstrong-mrs-reed/the-educational-screen-volume-23-24-hci/page-3-the-educational-screen-volume-23-24-hci.shtml ''The Educational Screen'' (January 1944), Chapter 12, "Now They Must Talk" by Arthur Edwin Krows]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the top, a tagline reads, "$10,000 reward paid to any person who finds a phonograph or similar device used in the phonofilms." The accompanying promotional text describes the slate of sound pictures as "the sensation of the century...Amazing! Astounding! Unbelievable".|Newspaper ad for Phonofilm shorts shown at the Strand Theatre in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] (''[[Sun Herald|Biloxi Daily Herald]]'', December 5, 1925)]]

==Premiere of Phonofilm==
From October 1921 to September 1922, DeForest lived in [[Berlin]], meeting with the Tri-Ergon developers and investigating other European sound film systems. He announced to the press in April 1922 that he would soon have a workable sound-on-film system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/2064/Lee-de-Forest-and-Phonofilm-Virtual-Broadway.html Lee de Forest and Phonofilm at Virtual Broadway website]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 1923, DeForest presented a demonstration of Phonofilm to the press.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/03/dayintech_0312 Randy Alfred, ''Wired'' magazine (12 March 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 April 1923, DeForest gave a private demonstration of the process to electrical engineers at the Engineering Society Building's Auditorium at 33 West 39th Street in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascemetsection.org/content/view/443/1023/#EngineeringSocietiesBuilding ASCE website entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 April 1923, DeForest premiered 18 short films made in Phonofilm — including vaudeville acts, musical performers, [[opera]], and [[ballet]] — at the Rivoli Theater at 1620 Broadway in New York City. The Rivoli's music director [[Hugo Riesenfeld]] co-hosted the presentation. The printed program gave credit to the "DeForest-Case Patents", but according to a letter [[Theodore Case]] wrote to DeForest immediately after the event, no credit was given to Case during the presentation itself. Case also expressed his displeasure that the program credited only the "DeForest-Case Patents", as Phonofilm's success was fully due to the work of Case and his Case Research Lab.

DeForest later took his show on the road, pitching Phonofilm directly to the general public at a series of special engagements across the country. The shorts shown at one such demonstration (from an original program at History [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], which holds DeForest's papers), exact date unknown but circa 1925, were as follows:

*(Overture)
*What the Phonofilm Means (Bart Doyle [?])
*A Study in Contrasts (comparing sound and silent film segments)
*From Far Seville ([[Concha Piquer]])
*Old Melodies ([[Charles Ross Taggart]])

*Negro Folk Songs ([[Noble Sissle]] and [[Eubie Blake]])
*Opera Versus Jazz ([[Eva Puck]] and [[Sammy White (actor)|Sammy White]])
*(Exit March—by the Phonofilm)

DeForest was forced to show these films in independent theaters such as the Rivoli, since Hollywood movie studios controlled all major U.S. movie theater chains at the time. De Forest's decision to film primarily short films (one reel), not [[feature film]]s limited the appeal of his process.

All or part of the [[Paramount Pictures]] features ''[[Bella Donna (1923 film)|Bella Donna]]'' (premiered 1 April 1923) and ''[[The Covered Wagon]]'' (premiered 16 March 1923) were filmed with Phonofilm as an experiment. (In the case of ''The Covered Wagon'', Hugo Riesenfeld composed the music for the film.) However, the Phonofilm versions were only shown at the premiere engagements, also at the Rivoli. "Siegfried", the first part of the [[Fritz Lang]] film ''[[Die Nibelungen]]'' (1924) had a Phonofilm soundtrack, but only at the New York City premiere at the [[Century Theatre (New York City)|Century Theatre]] on 23 August 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/C/CoveredWagon1923.html SilentEra entry for ''The Covered Wagon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/B/BellaDonna1923.html SilentEra entry for ''Bella Donna'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/N/Nibelungen1924.html SilentEra entry for ''Siegfried'']&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the few two-reel films made by DeForest in the Phonofilm process was ''[[Love's Old Sweet Song (1923 film)|Love's Old Sweet Song]]'' (1923), starring [[Louis Wolheim]], [[Donald Gallaher]], and the 20-year-old [[Una Merkel]]. DeForest kept to one-reel films because he was unable to solve the problem of reel changes—and the disruption in sound which would occur—when a projectionist in a movie theater changed reels.

==Development of Phonofilm==
[[Max Fleischer]] and [[Dave Fleischer]] used the Phonofilm process for their [[Sound Car-Tunes|Song Car-Tunes]] series of cartoons—all featuring the "[[bouncing ball (music)|Follow the Bouncing Ball]]" gimmick—starting in May 1924. Of the 36 titles in the Song Car-Tunes series, 19 used Phonofilm. Also in 1924, the Fleischer brothers partnered with DeForest, Edwin Miles Fadiman, and [[Hugo Riesenfeld]] to form Red Seal Pictures Corporation, which owned 36 theaters on the East Coast, extending as far west as [[Cleveland, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;"First Sound of Movies," DVD, Ray Pointer,Inkwell Images&lt;/ref&gt;

Red Seal Pictures and DeForest Phonofilm filed for bankruptcy in September 1926, and the Fleischers stopped releasing the Song Car-Tune films in Phonofilm shortly thereafter. Alfred Weiss acquired several of the silent Song Car-tunes including [["My Old Kentucky Home"]] and [["Tramp-Tram--Tramp, the Boys are Marching"]] and re-released them independently between 1929 to 1932 with new animation added using what sounds like the Powers Cinephone process.

DeForest also worked with [[Theodore Case]], using Case's patents to make the Phonofilm system workable. However, the two men had a falling out, shortly after DeForest filed suit in June 1923 against [[Freeman Harrison Owens]], another former collaborator of DeForest's. Case later went to movie mogul [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] of [[Fox Film Corporation]], who bought Case's patents, the American rights to the German [[Tri-Ergon]] patents, and the work of Owens to create Fox [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]].

==DeForest's use of Case patents==
Case's falling out with DeForest was due to DeForest taking full credit for the work of Case and Earl I. Sponable (1895–1977) at the Case Research Lab in [[Auburn, New York]]. To record on film, DeForest tried using a standard [[incandescent bulb|light bulb]] to expose amplified sound onto film. The bulbs quickly burned out, and, even while functioning, never produced a clear recording. To reproduce his nearly inaudible soundtracks, DeForest used a [[Photoresistor|photocell]] that could not react quickly enough to the varying light coming to it as the soundtrack passed through the sound gate, resulting in an incomplete reproduction of sound from an inadequate recording—a dual failure. DeForest's attempts to record and reproduce sound failed at every turn until he used inventions provided by Case.

Having failed to create a workable sound-on-film system by 1921, DeForest contacted Case to inquire about using a Case Research Lab invention, the Thallofide ([[thallium]] oxysulfide) Cell, for reproducing the recorded sound. Case provided DeForest with that major upgrade and later provided him with another Case Research Lab creation, the AEO Light, to use for recording the soundtrack. Due to DeForest's continuing misuse of these inventions, the Case Research Lab proceeded to build its own camera. That camera was used by Case and Sponable to film President Coolidge on 11 August 1924, creating one of the films shown by DeForest and claimed by him to be the product of "his" inventions.

Seeing that DeForest was more concerned with his own fame and recognition than he was with actually creating a workable system of sound film, and because of DeForest's continuing attempts to downplay the contributions of the Case Research Lab in the creation of Phonofilm, Case severed his ties with DeForest in the fall of 1925. On 23 July 1926, [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] of [[Fox Film Corporation]] bought Case's patents.

In 1924, [[Western Electric]] had settled on 24 [[Frame rate|frames per second]] (90 feet per minute) as the standard film speed for both the [[sound-on-disc]] and optical sound systems it was developing.&lt;!-- per WE engineer George Groves, there at the creation, in one of the accounts by him available online but eluding me at present --&gt; Western Electric's ERPI division dominated the theater hardware market when the sound revolution finally got underway, so its new standard speed was universally adopted by Fox and all the other studios as each began making sound films. (See the Fleischer cartoon ''Finding His Voice'' (1929), credited to Mr. W. E. Erpi.) As a consequence, Case's tests and DeForest's early Phonofilms, shot at about 21 frames per second, gave speakers and singers laughably high-pitched "helium voices" if they were run on a standard sound projector. The [[Library of Congress]] and other film archives have printed new copies of some early Phonofilms, modifying them by periodically duplicating frames and correspondingly "stretching" the soundtracks to make them compatible with standard projectors and [[telecine]] equipment.

==Producer Pat Powers attempts takeover of Phonofilm==
By 1926, DeForest gave up on trying to exploit the process—at least in the U.S. (see UK section below) -- and his company declared bankruptcy in September 1926. Without access to Case's inventions, DeForest was left with an incomplete system of sound film. Even so, producer [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]] invested in what remained of Phonofilm in the spring of 1927. DeForest was in financial difficulty due to his lawsuits against former associates Case and Owens. At this time, DeForest was selling cut-rate sound equipment to second-run movie theaters wanting to convert to sound on the cheap.

In June 1927, Powers made an unsuccessful takeover bid for DeForest's company. In the aftermath, Powers hired former DeForest technician [[William Garity]] to produce a cloned version of the Phonofilm system, which Powers dubbed '''Powers Cinephone'''. By now, DeForest was in too weak a financial position to mount a legal challenge against Powers for [[patent|patent infringement]]. Powers convinced [[Walt Disney]] to use Cinephone for a few sound cartoons such as ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' ([[1928 in film|1928]]) before Powers and Disney had a falling-out over money—and over Powers hiring away Disney animator [[Ub Iwerks]]—in 1930. Cinephone continued to be used in low-budget [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] through 1930, and in Disney's [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Silly Symphony]] cartoons—including ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'' and ''[[The Whoopee Party]]''—through 1932. (See list of Cinephone titles at IMDB in External Links below.)

==Hollywood chooses other sound systems==
While shunning Phonofilm, Hollywood studios introduced different systems for [[sound film|talkies]]. First up was the [[sound-on-disc]] process introduced by [[Warner Brothers]] as [[Vitaphone]]—which used a record disc synchronized with the film for sound. Warner Brothers released the feature film ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]'' starring [[John Barrymore]] on 6 August 1926 in Vitaphone, with music and sound effects only.

On 6 October 1927, Warner Brothers released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' with [[Al Jolson]] in Vitaphone. The film is often incorrectly credited as the first talking picture. ''The Jazz Singer'' was the first [[feature film]] to use synchronized sound for talking sequences rather than just for music and sound effects, and thus launched the [[talkie]] era, but DeForest's sound-on-film system was in fact the basis for modern sound movies.

The [[Movietone sound system|Fox Movietone]] system was first demonstrated to the public at the [[Sam H. Harris|Sam H. Harris Theatre]] in [[New York City]] on 21 January 1927, with a [[short film]] of [[Raquel Meller]] preceding the feature film ''[[What Price Glory? (1926 film)|What Price Glory?]]'', originally released in November 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin M. Bradley, ''The First Hollywood Musicals: A Critical Filmography of 171 Features, 1927 through 1932'' (McFarland, 2004) p6&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1927, producer William Fox introduced sound-on-film with the feature film ''[[Sunrise (film)|Sunrise]]'' by [[F. W. Murnau]]. In 1928, the sound-on-film process [[RCA Photophone]] was adopted by newly created studio [[RKO Radio Pictures]] and by [[Paramount Pictures]].

==Phonofilm in the UK==
In 1926, the owner of a UK cinema chain, M. B. Schlesinger, acquired the UK rights to Phonofilm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/elizabeth-armstrong-mrs-reed/the-educational-screen-volume-23-24-hci/page-3-the-educational-screen-volume-23-24-hci.shtml ''The Educational Screen'' (January 1944), Chapter 12, "Now They Must Talk" by Arthur Edwin Krows]&lt;/ref&gt; DeForest and Schlesinger filmed short films of British [[music hall]] performers such as [[Marie Lloyd|Marie Lloyd Jr.]] and [[Billy Merson]]—along with famous stage actors such as [[Sybil Thorndike]] and [[Bransby Williams]] performing excerpts of works by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]], and [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]—from September 1926 to May 1929. (In July 1925, ''The Gentleman'', a comedy short film excerpt of ''The 9 to 11 Revue'', directed by William J. Elliott in Phonofilm, was the first sound-on-film production made in England.)

On 4 October 1926, Phonofilm made its UK premiere with a program of short films presented at the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire Cinema]] in London, including a short film with [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]] welcoming Phonofilm to the UK. According to the [[British Film Institute]] website, the UK division of DeForest Phonofilm was taken over in August 1928 by British Talking Pictures and its subsidiary, British Sound Film Productions, which was formed in September 1928, it is believed British Talking Pictures acquired DeForests primary assets, including patents and designs for theatre audio equipment. 

In March 1929, a feature film ''[[The Clue of the New Pin (1929 film)|The Clue of the New Pin]]'', a part-talkie based on an [[Edgar Wallace]] novel, was trade-shown with ''[[The Crimson Circle (1929 film)|The Crimson Circle]]'', a German-UK coproduction which was also based on a Wallace novel. ''Crimson'' was filmed in DeForest Phonofilm, and ''Pin'' was made in British Phototone, a [[sound-on-disc]] process using 12-inch phonograph records synchronized with the film. However, the UK divisions of both Phonofilm and British Phototone soon closed.

The last films made in the UK in Phonofilm were released in early 1929, due to competition from Vitaphone, and sound-on-film systems such as Fox Movietone and RCA Photophone. The release of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s sound feature film ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' in June 1929, made in RCA Photophone, sealed the fate of Phonofilm in the UK.

==Phonofilm in Australia==
In June 1925, Phonofilm opened its first Australian office at 129 Bathurst Street in [[Sydney]]. On 6 July 1925, the first program of Phonofilms in Australia were shown at the Piccadilly Theatre in Sydney. A program was also shown at the Prince Edward Theatre in November and December 1925.

On 6 April 1927, [[Minister for Trade (Australia)|Minister for Trade]] [[Herbert Pratten]] appeared in a DeForest film to celebrate the opening of a Phonofilm studio in [[Rushcutters Bay, New South Wales|Rushcutters Bay]] in Sydney. On 12 May 1927, a Phonofilm of the Duke and Dutchess of York arriving at [[Farm Cove, New South Wales]] was shown at the Lyceum Theater in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:dcc6x1hkJwcJ:members.optusnet.com.au/picturepalace/De%2520Forest%2520Phonofilms.doc+australia+film+archive+phonofilm&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us De Forest Phonofilms - Rushcutters Bay]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, Phonofilm had to{{why|date=September 2015}} close all of its operations in Australia by October 1927, and sold its remaining studio facilities to an Australian company in October 1928.

==Phonofilm in Spain==
In 1928, Spanish producer Feliciano Manuel Vitores bought the Spanish rights to Phonofilm from DeForest and dubbed it "Fonofilm". He produced four films in the process, ''Cuando fui león'' (1928), ''En confesionario'' (1928), ''Va usted en punto con el banco'' (1928), and ''El misterio de la Puerta del Sol'' (1929). The first three were short films directed by Manuel Marín starring Spanish comedian Ramper, and the last was the first sound [[feature film]] made in Spain. The feature film was released in Spain by Divina Home Video in 2005, after years of being thought a [[lost film]].

==Phonofilm in Latin America==
The Maurice Zouary collection at the Library of Congress holds approximately 45 films made in Phonofilm. A DVD produced by Zouary about the history of Phonofilm says that a short film of opera singers performing the Sextet from ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' was made by the "Latin American division" of Phonofilm. No further information is known about this division of Phonofilm. In 1926, DeForest released a short film referred to as ''Cuban Sound Documentary'' which included the [[Cuban national anthem]] and excerpts from ''[[The Merry Widow]]''. However, little else is known of this film or whether other Phonofilms were made in Cuba.

==Legacy of Phonofilm==
More than 200 short films were made in the Phonofilm process, with many preserved in the collections of the [[Library of Congress]] (45 titles) and the [[British Film Institute]] (98 titles). In 1976, five Phonofilm titles were discovered in a trunk in Australia, and these films have been restored by Australia's [[National Film and Sound Archive]].

'''Porta Genova''' is a neighborhood ("[[quartiere]]") of [[Milan]], [[Italy]], located within the [[Zone 6 of Milan|Zone 6]] administrative division. The name "Porta Genova" means "[[Genoa]] gate"; the district is named after a city gate of the old [[Walls of Milan#Spanish walls|Spanish Walls of Milan]], namely that leading to [[Genoa]], that used to be in what is now Piazza Cantore. The only remnants of the old gate are the small buildings that used to house the customs offices, which replaced the Spanish gate in the 19th Century.

As for all Milanese ''quartieri'', the boundaries of Porta Genova are not formally defined; yet, they are usually thought of as comprising Via Solari, Via Bergognone, the [[Naviglio Grande]] canal and the Darsena. The district is centered in Piazza Cantore, where the city gate used to be, and the [[Milano Porta Genova railway station|Porta Genova railway station]], the oldest Milanese railway station to be still in operation. The station is the [[Terminal train station|terminus]] of the railway connecting Milan and [[Mortara, Lombardy|Mortara]]. Since the station is in the centre of Porta Genova, the district is divided in two parts by the railway; an old iron bridge connecting the two sides known as "la scaletta" (the "ladder"), located next to the station, is one of the traditional landmarks of the district.
[[File:Porta genova 1886.jpg|thumb|The darsena seen from Porta Genova, 1886 illustration]]

Porta Genova is also characterized by the [[Navigli]] [[canal]]s and the Darsena (the old [[dock (maritime)|dock]]), where two major Navigli meet, namely the [[Naviglio Grande]] and the [[Naviglio Pavese]]. As a consequence, much of the district is traversed by watercourses. One of the best known landmarks of the canal banks in Porta Genova is Vicolo Lavandaie, a small alley where Milanese woman used to wash clothes in the Naviglio's waters.

While Porta Genova is one of the most old-fashioned districts in Milan, and it is strongly connected to the tradition.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} It is also extremely popular with the Milanese youth, both for the  night-life (especially along the banks of the Naviglio) and its anti-comformist atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} This reflects, for example, in the almost ubiquitous [[street art]] works, the numerous" alternative" shops, as well as the peculiar character of the main street market of the area, the Fiera di Senigallia, which is renowned as one of the best places in Milan where to look for unusual, rare and bizarre merchandise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2111">'''Programme One''' was a [[television]] channel produced and transmitted by [[Soviet Central Television]], the television broadcasting organization of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. It had a mixed schedule of news and entertainment, with the emphasis on events in the USSR, and also included regional programming.

==History==
'''Programme One''' was established on 22 March 1951 when, as part of a reorganization of the television system, the '''Moscow Television Station''' changed its name to reflect its planned expansion. It was known officially as the ''' CT USSR Programme One''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: '''Первая программа ЦТ СССР''').

The channel, which was transmitted on the [[SECAM]] D/K standard, carried advertising for the first time in the 1980s.  The channel was broadcast until 1991. In September of that year, it was renamed as '''Central Television Channel One''' (Russian: '''Первый канал ЦТ'''), and then in December, following the dissolution of the USSR, became '''Ostankino Television Channel One'''.

Following the [[dissolution of the USSR]], Programme One's frequencies were transferred to the new state broadcasting organizations in the former [[republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]], while in the [[Russia]]n republic the main Ostankino Television channel took over its signal and transmitters.

==Programmes==
The periodic [[Little Blue Light]] became a staple of [[Soviet Union]] celebrations during [[New Year's Eve]], [[International Women's Day]], and [[International Workers' Day]]. The programme continues to run today on [[Russia 1]].

The news department did not employ news journalists until 1989, when they began to front the shorter bulletins (the main 18:30 and 21:00 news programmes was fronted only by senior journasts until after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'etat attempt|failed coup d'etat]]).

[[File:Constantin Jiquidi - Aud̦ind aşa văcarul (Păcală, de P. Dulfu).JPG|thumb|Sentenced to [[Drowning#Capital punishment|death by drowning]], Păcală tricks the ignorant cowherd into taking his place in the [[burlap]] sack. Illustration by {{Interlanguage link multi|Constantin Jiquidi|ro}}, [[Petre Dulfu]] version (1894)]]

'''Păcală''' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]], from ''a păcăli'', "to dupe"; sometimes rendered '''Pâcală''' or '''Pîcală''') is a fictional character in [[Romanian folklore]], [[Romanian literature|literature]] and [[Romanian humor|humor]]. An irreverent young man, seemingly a peasant, he reserves contempt and irony for the village authorities (whether priest, [[boyar]] or judge), but often plays the fool. Several derivative works codify the various versions of ''Păcală'' anecdotes. Examples include: ''Pâcală'', by [[Ion Creangă]]; ''Păcală în satul lui'' ("Păcală in His Village") by [[Ioan Slavici]]; ''Isprăvile lui Păcală'' ("Păcală's Achievements") by [[Petre Dulfu]]; and ''Întâmplările lui Păcală'' ("The Adventures of Păcală"), part of ''[[Legende sau basmele românilor]]''.

''Păcală'' legends also served to inspire other creations, from the eponymous satirical magazine put out by [[Pantazi Ghica]] in the 1860s to [[Constantin S. Nicolăescu-Plopșor]]'s 1960s sequel ''Tivisoc şi Tivismoc'' ("Tivisoc and Tivismoc"). He is the main protagonist in two [[Cinema of Romania|Romanian films]], both written and directed by [[Geo Saizescu]]; and inspired artist [[Sandu Florea]] to create his first comic strip (1968).

==Origin==
Rhizomatiks was founded as a collective of creative people in 2006 in Tokyo to work on large-scale commercial projects.&lt;&lt;ref name=dauerer&gt;{{cite web |author= Verena Dauerer |title= &lt;code+culture&gt; part one |publisher= Japan Times |location=Tokyo |url= http://features.japantimes.co.jp/media-art-pt1/ |accessdate=April 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One early project was with the Japanese pop group [[Perfume (Japanese band)|Perfume]], work with the single ''Polyrhythm'' in 2007, which led to touring with the band.&lt;ref name=dauerer/&gt;&lt;ref name=ftcom&gt;{{cite news |author=Liz Jobey  |title= Performance: Daito Manabe's light fantastic  |newspaper=FT.com  |date=July 26, 2013   }}&lt;/ref&gt; They became widely noticed with a video piece in 2008 called ''Electric Stimulus To Face'', which had more than a million [[YouTube]] hits in its first month.&lt;ref name=ftcom/&gt;

The company has gone international, becoming a fixture at transmedia festivals around the world and has expanded its portfolio 10x.&lt;ref name=dauerer/&gt;&lt;ref name=ftcom/&gt;&lt;ref name=fquiroz&gt;{{cite news |author= Fernanda Quiroz |title= Lo más esperado en el Cervantino: Rhizomatiks + Elevenplay |newspaper= W Radio |location=Mexico City |url= http://www.wradio.com.mx/noticias/sociedad/8203lo-mas-esperado-en-el-cervantino-rhizomatiks--elevenplay/20141009/nota/2454462.aspx |accessdate=April 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
Rhizomatiks is an eclectic combination of creators which includes architects, visual artists, media artists, designers, musicians, engineers and programmers.

The founder of the group is {{Interlanguage link multi|Daito Manabe|ko|3=다이토 마나베}} (1976), an artist, composer, programmer, designer, DJ and [[VJing|VJ]].&lt;ref name=fquiroz/&gt;&lt;ref name=fusionan/&gt;&lt;ref name=todaysart&gt;{{cite web  |title= Daito Manabe – Rhizomatiks |publisher= Today's Art |location=Netherlands |date= 2014  |url= http://todaysart.nl/2014/summit/daito-manabe/ |accessdate=April 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manabe is from a traditional media art environment, with a degree in dynamic sensory programming from the [[International Academy of Media Arts and Sciences]] and a degree in mathematics from the T[[okyo University of Science]].&lt;ref name=dauerer/&gt;&lt;ref name=todaysart/&gt;

The CTO of the group is Motoi Ishibashi (1976), an artist and engineer. Lives and works in Tokyo. Ishibashi studied control systems engineering at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, followed by mechanical and image processing engineering at the Institute of Advanced Media Arts and Sciences (IAMAS) in Gifu, at the inception of digital media production. He met Manabe at IAMAS, who was also a student there. He is currently working on the development of new artistic methods touching on both the visual environment and the elaboration of engineering solutions in terms of artistic production and interactive public spaces. In 2011, he and Manabe were the recipients of an Award of Distinction in the interactive art category of the Prix Ars Electronica. That same year, he received the Excellence Award at the 15th edition of the Japan Media Art Festival. Since 2015, he has co-directed Rhizomatiks Research along with Manabe, a strand devoted to research and development in the spheres of art, technology and entertainment.&lt;ref name=dauerer/&gt;&lt;ref name=members&gt;{{cite web  |title= Members  |publisher= Rhizomatiks|location=Tokyo  |url= http://rhizomatiks.com/#/members/ |accessdate=April 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founding member Seiichi Saito (1975) studied architectural design At [[Columbia University]]  in New York and worked in advertising starting in 2000 before returning to Japan and joining Rhizomatiks.&lt;ref name=dauerer/&gt;&lt;ref name=jinsmeme&gt;{{cite web  |title= EPISODE 01 SEIICHI SAITO/RHIZOMATIKS × KENTARO SHIHAKU/GLIDER  |publisher= Jins Meme   |location=Japan  |url= https://www.jins-jp.com/jinsmeme/en/episode/episode01.html |accessdate=April 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His is noted for this three-dimensional interactive commercial art work, based on architectural concepts. Today he is the director of the company and also lectures part-time at the Tokyo University of Science.&lt;ref name=jinsmeme/&gt;

Other founding member is Hidenori Chiba, who has a background in website development. Currently his is in charge of web design, system engineering and programming.&lt;ref name=dauerer/&gt;&lt;ref name="members" /&gt;

Other members of the company include Satoshi Horii, Daisuke Nakahama, Hiroyuki Hori, Hiroyasu Kimora, Sumito Kamoi, Ichiro Kojima, Youichi Sakamoto, Muryo Honma, Motoi Ishibashi, Megumi Shima and Keisuki Arikuni.&lt;ref name=members/&gt;

==Work and artistry==
Rhizomatiks produces interactive materials with their work crossing the boundaries between design, art and entertainment.&lt;ref name=fquiroz/&gt; Projects often involved collecting massive amounts of data using [[motion capture]], [[kinect controller]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and sensors to track dance movements in order to recreate human forms and movements as 3-D representations in real time. They also use [[projection mapping]], lasers, sonar, robots and even drones.&lt;ref name=dauerer/&gt;&lt;ref name=ftcom/&gt;&lt;ref name=conaculta&gt;{{cite web  |title= Rhizomatiks x elevenplay Pulse |publisher= CONACULTA  |location=Mexico  |url= http://www.conaculta.gob.mx/estados/actividades_detalle.php?id=116827#.VTZZwPBZ1rk |accessdate=April 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New ideas will cross between artistic and commercial projects. The commercial pieces tend to be on a larger scale because of funding.&lt;ref name=dauerer/&gt; ''(Rhizomatiks) is like a music label'', Manabe says. ''People with similar values gather and each person pursues different projects''.&lt;ref name=dauerer/&gt; Leadership changes from project to project.  ''They’re a challenging group of people'', Shimizu says. ''Whether the project's commercial or noncommercial in nature, they aren’t able to stop trying something new. They are not just artists, they’re also Japanese craftsmen who focus on detail. This might also explain why they are essentially ‘process driven’ (in the way they approach projects).''&lt;ref name=dauerer/&gt;

It made its public debut on 27 December 1922 at the [[Selwyn Theatre]] in [[New York City]], the only theater ever equipped with the system. The program included several short films, a live presentation of projected 3D shadows, and the 95-minute feature film ''M.A.R.S.'' (or ''[[The Man from M.A.R.S. (1922 film)|The Man From M.A.R.S.]]''), later re-released in 2D as ''Radio-Mania''.

Teleview pioneered the [[alternate-frame sequencing]] method of stereoscopic 3D projection. The basic principle had been patented as early as 1897, but the improved Teleview implementation was the first to be presented to the public.

Left-eye and right-eye films were run through a pair of interlocked projectors with their shutters operating out of phase. Each shutter was three-bladed, so that each pair of film frames was projected three times (i.e., left-right-left-right-left-right) before the mechanisms moved the next pair of frames into position. At the minimum 16-frames-per-second silent film projection speed, this resulted in a minimum of 48 flashes per second per eye, eliminating the severe flicker that fatally flawed earlier systems in which the left-eye and right-eye frames alternated on a single strip of film projected at twice the normal rate.

Each theater seat was equipped with an attached viewing device supported by a gooseneck stand. It contained a rotary shutter synchronized with the projector shutters, so that each of the user's eyes saw only the images intended for it. [[Persistence of vision]] made both views appear to be uninterrupted and a normal fully stereoscopic image was seen.

Hammond's system won praise, but because of the high cost of installing the equipment, and the inconvenience of having to peer through the unwieldy viewer, it disappeared completely after this lone engagement ended in early 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Zone, Ray (2007). ''Stereoscopic Cinema and the Origins of 3-D Film, 1838-1952'', University Press of Kentucky, pp. 107-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternating image method enjoyed a revival after the advent of [[optoelectronics|optoelectronic]] shutters in the 1970s made it more practical. Modern [[LC shutter glasses]] are used for viewing projected 3D films in some theaters, as well as [[3DTV]] video and stereoscopic computer graphics.

'''''Tux Paint''''' is a [[raster graphics editor]] (a program for creating and processing [[raster graphics]]) geared towards young children. The project was started in 2002 by Bill Kendrick who continues to maintain and improve it, with help from numerous volunteers. Tux Paint is seen by many as a free software alternative to [[Kid Pix]], a similar [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[educational software]] product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmerc.com/news/newsbite/893 MacMerc review of Tux Paint], June 18, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Tux Paint was initially created for the [[Linux]] operating system, as there was no suitable drawing program for young children available for Linux at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osnews.com/story.php/1549/Interview-with-Bill-Kendrick-of-NewBreedSoftware/ Interview with Bill Kendrick of NewBreedSoftware at OSNews], August 16, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It is written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and uses various free and open source [[library (software)|helper libraries]], including [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)]], and has since been made available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X|Apple Mac OS X]], [[BeOS]] and other platforms.

== Features ==
[[File:Tuxpaint-drawing.png|thumb|Drawing with Tux Paint's Paint tool]]

Tux Paint stands apart from typical graphics editing software (such as [[GIMP]] or [[Photoshop]])  that it was designed to be usable by [[children]] as young as 3 years of age. The [[user interface]] is meant to be intuitive, and utilizes [[icon (computing)|icons]], audible feedback and textual hints to help explain how the software works. The brightly colored interface, [[sound effects]] and cartoon mascot ([[Tux (mascot)|Tux]], the mascot of the Linux kernel) are meant to engage children.

Tux Paint's normal interface is split into five sections:

* Toolbox, containing the various basic tools (see below) and application controls ([[undo]], save, new, [[printing|print]])
* Canvas, where the [[digital image|images]] are drawn and edited
* Color [[Palette (computing)|palette]], where colors can be chosen (when applicable to the current tool)
* Selector, providing various selectable objects (e.g., brushes, [[digital font|fonts]] or sub-tools, depending on the current tool)
* Information area, where instructions, tips and encouragement are provided

A simple [[slideshow]] feature allows previously saved images to be displayed as a basic flip-book [[animation]] or as a slide [[presentation]].

=== Basic drawing tools ===

Like most popular graphics editing and composition tools, Tux Paint includes a paintbrush, an eraser, and tools to draw lines, [[polygon|polygonal shapes]] and text. Tux Paint provides multiple levels of [[undo]] and [[redo]], allowing accidental or unwanted changes to be removed while editing a picture.

=== Files and printing ===

Tux Paint was designed in such a way that the user does not need to understand the underlying [[operating system]] or how to [[Computer file management|deal with files]]. The "Save" and "Open" commands were designed to mimic those of software for [[personal digital assistant]] devices, such as the [[Palm Pilot|Palm]] handheld.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuxpaint.org/reviews/communitykids/ "Tux Paint Great Fun for Your Kids... If They Can Get You Off the Program!"], Community Kids Magazine, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; When one saves a picture in Tux Paint, they do not need to provide a [[computer file|file]] name or [[file browser|browse]] for where to place it. When one goes to open a previously saved picture, a collection of [[thumbnail]]s of saved images is shown.

Similarly, printing is typically a 'no questions asked' process, as well.

=== Advanced drawing tools ===
[[File:Tuxpaint-magic-tools.png|thumb|A drawing made with a variety of Magic Tools]]

Tux Paint includes a number of 'filters' and 'special effects' which can be applied to a drawing, such as [[Gaussian blur|blurring]], fading, and making the picture look as though it was drawn in [[chalk]] on [[pavement (roads)|pavement]]. These are available through the 'Magic' tool in Tux Paint.  Starting with version 0.9.18, Tux Paint's 'Magic' tools are built as [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]] that are loaded at runtime and use a [[C (programming language)|C]] [[Application programming interface|API]] specifically for creating such tools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuxpaint.org/latest/tuxpaint-0.9.18-press-release-en.php3 Tux Paint 0.9.18 press release], November 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tuxpaint-space-stamps.png|thumb|left|A space scene using Tux Paint Rubber Stamps]]

A large collection of [[art]]work and [[Photography|photographic]] imagery are also available (under a [[license]] allowing free redistribution), and may be placed inside drawings using Tux Paint's "[[Rubber stamp|Rubber Stamp]]" tool. Stamps can be in either [[Raster graphics|raster (bitmap)]] format (in [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] format, supporting 24[[color depth|bpp]] and full [[alpha channel|alpha]] transparency), or as [[vector graphics]] (in [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] format) on many platforms Tux Paint supports. As of mid-2008, over 800 stamps are included in the stamps collection.

=== Parental and teacher controls ===
[[File:Tuxpaint-config-sshot.png|thumb|Tux Paint Config., a graphical configuration tool for Tux Paint]]

As features are added to Tux Paint, [[computer configuration|configuration]] options have been added that allow parents and teachers to disable features and alter the behavior to better suit their children's or students' needs, or to better integrate the software in their home or school computing environment. Typical options, such as enabling or disabling sound effects and full-screen mode are available.  There are also options that help make Tux Paint suitable for younger or [[disabled]] children, such as displaying text using only [[uppercase]] letters or ignoring the distinction between buttons on the [[Computer mouse|mouse]].

=== Localization ===

Tux Paint has been [[translation|translated]] into numerous languages, and has support for the display of text in languages that use non-Latin character sets, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Greek language|Greek]], or [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. As of June 2008, over 80 languages are supported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuxpaint.org/help/po/ "Help Us Translate"] page at Tux Paint website&lt;/ref&gt; Correct support for complex languages requires [[Pango]]. [[Sound effects]] and descriptive sounds for stamp imagery can also be localized.  Tux Paint includes its own form of [[input method]] support, allowing entry of non-Latin characters using the 'Text' tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuxpaint.org/latest/tuxpaint-0.9.17-press-release-en.php3 |title=Tux Paint 0.9.17 announcement |publisher=Tuxpaint.org |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese ([[Romanized]] [[Hiragana]] and Romanized [[Katakana]]), Korean ([[Hangul|Hangul 2-bul]]) and Traditional Chinese are currently supported.

== Distribution ==
[[File:tuxpaint-golden-gate-bridge-sf.png|thumb|"[[Golden Gate Bridge]]", drawn using Tux Paint]]

Tux Paint is included with the software that comes with the [[ASUS Eee PC]]. It is also a standard package in educationally oriented [[Linux distribution]]s, such as [[Debian]] Jr. and [[Edubuntu]], as an optional package in numerous other Linux distributions, as well as part of numerous educationally oriented Linux [[Live CD]]s.  It is included in various software collections for Windows (such as [[GNUWin II]] and [[Open Source Software CD]]), as well as in [[Portable application|portable software]] collections for Windows, since it can be run as a stand-alone application (without needing to be installed system-wide). Tux Paint is also available as an activity within the free and open source educational suite [[GCompris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tuxpaint.org/links/#distributors |title=Tux Paint distributors |publisher=Tuxpaint.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Warsaw Concerto''''' is a short work for piano and orchestra by [[Richard Addinsell]], written for the 1941 British film ''[[Dangerous Moonlight]]'', which is about the Polish struggle against the 1939 invasion by [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|Nazi Germany]]. In performance it normally lasts just under ten minutes. The concerto is an example of [[programme music]], representing both the struggle for Warsaw and the romance of the leading characters in the film. It became very popular in Britain during [[World War II]].

The concerto is written in imitation of the style of [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]. It initiated a trend for similar short piano concertos in the Romantic style, which have been dubbed "tabloid concertos".&lt;ref name = "dnn"/&gt;

==Background==
The composer, [[Richard Addinsell]], was born in London and initially studied law before turning to a career in music. His time at the Royal College of Music was brief, as he was soon drawn to musical theatre, and he also wrote for radio, but his most memorable contributions are to a series of film scores beginning in 1936. He wrote the music for the 1939 film ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939 film)|Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'', the original ''[[Gaslight (1940 film)|Gaslight]]'' (released in 1940, not to be confused with the later Hollywood version), ''[[Scrooge (1951 film)|Scrooge]]'', and ''Dangerous Moonlight'' (1941, also released in the US as ''Suicide Squadron''). It is this last picture that began the trend of “tabloid concertos,”&lt;ref name = "dnn"&gt;K. J. Donnelly, ''British Film Music and Film Musicals'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007), 50. John Huntley defines the term as a "piece of context film music which was duly recorded and edited into the finished film". See his ''British Film Music'' (New York: Arno Press &amp; The New York Times, 1972), 54.&lt;/ref&gt; classical-style compositions written for performance in movies. John Huntley explores the reason behind this concept: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The associations which individual members of the audience may have in relation to a certain piece of well-known music are quite beyond the control of the director of a film in which it is used…. And so with ''Dangerous Moonlight'' it was rightly decided to have a piece of music specially written, that could be used to become associated in the mind of the audience with Poland, air raids in Warsaw, and whatever the director wanted to suggest.&lt;ref&gt;John Huntley, ''British Film Music'' (New York: Arno Press &amp; The New York Times, 1972), 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concerto was not part of the original plan. According to [[Roy Douglas]], at that time orchestrator for all of Addinsell's scores: "The film's director had originally wanted to use [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second Piano Concerto]], but this idea was either forbidden by the copyright owners or was far too expensive".&lt;ref name="Douglas"&gt;Roy Douglas, "The Warsaw Connection: Roy Douglas Remembers How It Actually Turned Out", ''ICRC'' 18 (1999): 62; reprinted with slight changes in Jan G. Swynnoe, ''The Best Years of British Film Music: 1936–1958'' (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2002), 215.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus Addinsell wanted the piece to sound as much like Rachmaninoff as possible, and Douglas remembers, "while I was orchestrating the ''Warsaw Concerto'' I had around me the miniature scores of the Second and [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Third]] Piano Concertos, as well as the ''[[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]]''."&lt;ref name="Douglas"/&gt; And although it is at the heart of ''Dangerous Moonlight'', the Concerto is never performed complete but rather revealed piecemeal. The opening of the work is heard when the two protagonists meet, and it is further developed when they are on their honeymoon. Finally, in the only extended concert sequence, we are given the closing section. But its use is not restricted to scenes with the "composer" at the piano. The themes are found as underscoring throughout the film, and in this way a brief concert piece gains a dramatic resonance that belies its small scale.

==Role in the film==
''Dangerous Moonlight'' takes place at the start of World War II and tells the story of a Polish concert pianist and composer, Stefan Radecki ([[Anton Walbrook]]) who defends his country by becoming a fighter pilot. After an air raid in Warsaw by the German army, he is discovered by an American reporter, Carol Peters ([[Sally Gray]]), practising the piano in a bombed-out building. It is the opening of his ''Warsaw Concerto'', at this point a work in progress, and the first line he says to her is, "It is not safe to be out alone when the moon is so bright" (referring to the moonlight bombing raids). Gazing intently at Carol and disclosing "something lovely you've just given me", he introduces the lyrical second theme of the Concerto. And, indeed, this melody is always associated with Carol.&lt;ref name = "lain"&gt;Laing, Heather, "The Gendered Score: Music and Gender in 1940s Melodrama and the Woman's Film", Ashgate Publishing, 2007, pp.156-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Rachmaninoff, Addinsell introduces it almost as a nocturne. Stefan speaks of the piece later in the film: "This music is you and me. It's the story of the two of us in Warsaw, of us in America, of us in … where else I don't know. That's why I can't finish it". But finish it he does. Similar to the way that Rachmaninoff returns to his second theme in his Second Piano Concerto, the "Carol" melody is used, not only to bind together the emotional strands of the drama, but to bring the Concerto to a triumphant conclusion. Throughout the film, the unfinished piece is defined in a relationship with [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s [[Polonaises Op. 40 (Chopin)|"Military" Polonaise]], symbolising Polish patriotism.&lt;ref name = "lain"/&gt; It is "completed" when the Polonaise elements are integrated with the Romantic theme, implying the fusion of romantic and patriotic love.&lt;ref name = "lain"/&gt;

Within the context of its story, ''Dangerous Moonlight'' is also effective in creating the impression of a larger work written and performed by the film's fictional composer and pianist. When snatches of the Concerto are first played, one character tells another, "I've got the records", and when the "premiere" is shown, we are provided with a close-up of the program, ''Warsaw Concerto'', with three movements listed. Only one movement was actually written by Addinsell.

==Popularity==
The success of the film led to an immediate demand for the work, and a recording was dutifully supplied from the film’s soundtrack (at nine minutes, it fit perfectly on two sides of a 12-inch disk playing at 78 rpm) along with sheet music for a piano solo version.&lt;ref&gt;Huntley, ''British Film Music,'' 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such unexpected success had another consequence. The off-screen piano part was played by [[Louis Kentner]], a fine British musician known for his performances of [[Franz Liszt]], but he had insisted that there be no on-screen credit, for fear that his participation in a popular entertainment would harm his classical reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, ''The Warsaw Connection'', 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  He lost his qualms when the recording sold in the millions, and Douglas notes that he even asked for royalties (they were granted).&lt;ref&gt;In the revised version of Douglas's article that appeared in Swynnoe, ''The Best Years of British Film Music,'' Douglas learned that Kentner did not receive royalties; see p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately the ''Warsaw Concerto'' was such a hit that it made the then unusual journey from movie screen to concert hall.

In his 1944 appearance on ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'', [[Guy Gibson]], leader of the [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|Dambusters]] raid, asked for it as his first choice.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Richard (1994). ''Guy Gibson''. London: Viking, Penguin Group. pp. 233–234.&lt;/ref&gt;

One commentator has suggested that the ''Warsaw Concerto'' is the most significant instrumental work written in Britain during the war, still conjuring up a time and place better than any other piece.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Philip (2003). Liner notes to CD ''The Film Music of Richard Addinsell''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Władysław Machejek'''  (February 25, 1920 – December 21, 1991)  was a [[communist]] [[apparatchik|official]], an aspiring writer and [[Hoax|hoax artist]] during the [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)#The Stalinist reign of terror|Stalinist reign of terror]] in [[Poland]] following World War II. He wrote fabricated accounts of [[Cursed soldiers|anti-communist underground]] mainly for his own political gains as regional [[party secretary]] and later member of the communist highest parliamentary echelons.&lt;ref name="niniwa2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://niniwa2.cba.pl/towarzysze_nieudanej_podrozy_14.htm | title=Co ja robię w tym kościele | publisher=''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'' | work=Towarzysze Nieudanej Podrózy | date=June 3, 2000 | accessdate=August 25, 2012 | author=Anna Bikont, Joanna Szczęsna }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the coarse and infamous nature of his works, he has been described as a "legendary socialist scribbler".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Janusz Anderman |url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,34311,138634.html |title=Machejek, Władysław (1920-1991) |publisher=Wiadomosci.gazeta.pl |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Machejek was born on February 25, 1920  into a peasant family in the hamlet of [[Chodów, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Chodów]]. He joined the [[Communist Party of Poland]] as a youth.&lt;ref name=osaarchivum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/116-1-259.shtml |title=A Rumanian-Polish Literary Controversy |publisher=Osaarchivum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II he served in the Soviet-sponsored partisan organizations [[Gwardia Ludowa]] and [[Armia Ludowa]].&lt;ref name=onet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/36217,,,,machejek_wladyslaw,haslo.html |title=Machejek Władysław - WIEM, darmowa encyklopedia |publisher=Portalwiedzy.onet.pl |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war he became a member of the new Polish communist party [[PZPR]] and took over the post of its regional secretary in the town of [[Nowy Targ]] not far from where he grew up. Soon, he became a member of the provincial party cell in [[Kraków]], and eventually deputy to the [[Sejm]] (Polish parliament) in the [[People's Republic of Poland]].&lt;ref name=osaarchivum/&gt;&lt;ref name=onet/&gt; He was selected editor-in-chief of ''[[Życie Literackie]]'' magazine under Stalinism (1952) and became a prolific writer of ideological propaganda and coarse, often embarrassing polemics supporting the communist [[Party line (politics)|party line]].&lt;ref name=onet/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paczkowski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drozdowski1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marian Marek Drozdowski|title=1956: polska emigracja a Kraj : antologia żródeł|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAYrAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 August 2012|year=1998|publisher=Oficyna Wydawnicza "Typografika"|isbn=978-83-86417-31-5|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been known on occasion to attack the authorities of other communist countries (such as [[Romania]]), but his criticism was tolerated.&lt;ref name=osaarchivum/&gt;  It is said he always carried a bottle of vodka in his hollow briefcase.&lt;ref name="niniwa2" /&gt; Machejek died in [[Kraków]] at the age of 71 shortly after the collapse of the communist regime in the [[People's Republic of Poland|People's Republic]], and the re-emergence of sovereign Polish state in the [[Autumn of Nations]].

==Works==
Machejek was a political hack writer.&lt;ref name="Paczkowski" /&gt; His most infamous book ''Rano przeszedł huragan'' (''In the Morning There Came A Hurricane'') published in 1955 presented purported crimes in the [[Podhale]] region committed by the ''Ogniowcy'' partisan units under [[Józef Kuraś]].&lt;ref name="tygodnik-onet.pl/2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tygodnik.onet.pl/1,6945,druk.html | title=Horror podmalowany | publisher=''[[Tygodnik Powszechny]]'' | work=Historia | date=February 27, 2008 | accessdate=August 25, 2012 | author=Maciej Korkuć | quote=Dr Maciej Korkuć jest historykiem, pracuje w krakowskim oddziale IPN: ... ów opis pochodzi z fałszywki – rzekomego pamiętnika „Ognia", w rzeczywistości napisanego ładnych parę lat po jego śmierci.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was based on a fictional diary of their leader written by Machejek himself. In an often ''coarse'' and even ''primitive'' prose,&lt;ref name="Paczkowski"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=WoKQWem2yl4C&amp;lpg=PA341&amp;ots=pNepaoio_0&amp;dq=%22W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Machejek%22&amp;pg=PA341#v=onepage&amp;q=%22W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Machejek%22&amp;f=false | title=Władysław Machejek (in: Real Socialism: The Iron Fist) | publisher=Penn State Press | work=The Spring Will Be Ours: Poland and the Poles from Occupation to Freedom | year=2003 | accessdate=August 25, 2012 | author=Andrzej Paczkowski, Jane Cave | pages=341&amp;ndash; | isbn=0271023082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machejek painted Poland's anti-communists as [[motley crew]] of bloodthirsty anti-Semites who killed Jews, persecuted the Slovak population of the region and who preyed on innocent people.&lt;ref name="tygodnik-onet.pl"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tygodnik2003-2007.onet.pl/0,1355063,druk.html | title=Interview with dr Maciej Korkuć of the Institute of National Remembrance | publisher=''[[Tygodnik Powszechny]]'', reprint by [[Onet.pl]] | work=Partyzant nie nadstawia policzka | year=2007 | accessdate=August 25, 2012 | author=Wojciech Bonowicz and Michał Kuźmiński | quote=''Władysław Machejek spreparował „dziennik" Kurasia. ({{lang-en|how Władysław Machejek invented the Kuraś diary}}).''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although those fragments were simply invented by Machejek, some historians, most recently [[Jan Tomasz Gross]] in his ''[[Fear: Anti-Semitism in Poland After Auschwitz]]'' (2006), have fallen for his claim that the novel was based on facts (Kuraś himself was hunted to death by secret police), thus treating Machejek's falsehood as a valid source.&lt;ref name="tygodnik-onet.pl/2"/&gt;

Polish poet, literary critic and dissident activist [[Stanisław Barańczak]] saw Machejek's style as worthy of mention and wrote an essay, ''U źródeł machejkizmu'', published in his 1990 book ''Książki najgorsze'' (''The Worst of Books''). He suggested that Machejek's style was unique enough to merit a special term, ''machejkizm'' or ''machejcyzm''. According to Barańczak, Machejek's style was a mixture of the worst elements of [[socialist literature|socialist (communist) literature]], namely coarse language of an uneducated man mixed with the pompous and complex [[officialese]] of the Party. Machejek, according to Barańczak, was a master of writing empty sentences, which contain no value, no real message, are not meant to be read, but function simply to fill space.&lt;ref name=Bar&gt;Stanisław Barańczak, ''U źródeł machejkizmu'' [in] ''Książki Najgorsze i parę innych esejów krytycznoliterackich'', Wydawnictwo a5, Poznań 1990, p. 91-94.&lt;/ref&gt;
