'''Afro-Asians''' or '''African-Asians''' (also sometimes known as '''Black Asians''' or '''Blasians'''), are persons of mixed [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|African]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] ancestry.&lt;ref name=definition /&gt; Historically, Afro-Asian populations have been marginalized as a result of human migration and social conflict.&lt;ref name=Reicheneker /&gt;

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===

====Katanga Afro-Japanese====
During the 1970s, an increased demand for [[copper]] and [[cobalt]] attracted [[Japanese people|Japanese]] investments in the mineral-rich southeastern region of [[Katanga Province]]. Over a 10-year period, more than 1,000 Japanese miners relocated to the region, confined to a strictly male-only camp. Arriving without family or spouses, the men often sought social interaction outside the confounds of their camps. In search of intimacy with the opposite sex, sometimes resulting in cohabitation, the men openly engaged in interracial dating and relationships, a practice embraced by the local society. As a result, a number of Japanese miners fathered children with native Congolese women. However, most of the mixed-race infants resulting from these unions died, soon after birth. Multiple testimonies of local people suggest that the infants were poisoned by a Japanese lead physician and nurse working at the local mining hospital. Subsequently, the circumstances would have brought the miners shame as most of them already had families back in their native Japan. The practice forced many native Katangan mothers to hide their children by not reporting to the hospital to give birth.

Today, fifty Afro-Japanese have formed an association of ''Katanga Infanticide'' survivors. The organization has hired legal counsel seeking a formal investigation into the killings. The group submitted an official inquiry to both the [[National Assembly (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|Congolese]] and [[Government of Japan|Japanese]] governments, to no avail. Issues specific to this group include having no documentation of their births since not having been born in the local hospital spared their lives. The total number of survivors is unknown.&lt;ref name="katangainfanticide" group="Africa-Congo" /&gt;

===Equatorial Guinea===
The mid-19th century saw about 500 Chinese laborers and indentured servants, along with a handful from [[Portuguese India|India]] stealthily imported to the island of [[Bioko|Fernando Po]] through the once [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] occupied [[Macau]].&lt;ref name="anshan" group="Africa-EQ" /&gt; While most of these servants returned to their homelands at the end of their servitude, a few remained, settling and marrying into the local population. One example is immigrant East Indian laborer Francisco Kashu Alimama who remained in [[Moka, Equatorial Guinea|Moka]] after the death of his last living relative. He married the daughter of one of the last [[Malabo Lopelo Melaka|Bubi]] kings, producing several Indo-Equatoguinean children.

===Kenya===
{{See also|Chinese people in Kenya|Indians in Kenya|Pate Island}}

====Zheng He's fleet====
In 1999, [[Nicholas Kristof]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported a surprising encounter on the island of [[Pate Island|Pate]], where he found a village of stone huts. He talked to an elderly man living in the village who said that he was a descendant of Chinese explorers who were shipwrecked there centuries before. The Chinese had supposedly traded with the locals and had even loaded giraffes onto their ship to take back to China. However, the Chinese ran aground on a nearby reef. Kristof found evidence that confirmed the man's story. Such evidence included the Asian features of the people in the village, plus Asian-looking porcelain artifacts.&lt;ref name="nytkristof" group="Africa-Kenya" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pbshdingham" group="Africa-Kenya" /&gt; These descendants of [[Chinese people in Kenya#Zheng He's fleet|Zheng He's fleet]] occupy both [[Pate Island|Pate]] and [[Lamu Island|Lamu]] Islands.

====New immigration====
New interest in Kenya's natural resources has attracted over $1 billion of investment from Chinese firms. This has propelled new development in Kenya's infrastructure with Chinese firms bringing in their own male workers to build roads.&lt;ref name=kenyainvestment group=Africa-Kenya /&gt; The temporary residents usually arrive without their spouses and families. Thus, a rise of incidents involving local college-aged females has resulted in an increased rate of Afro-Chinese infant births to single Kenyan mothers.&lt;ref name="ruiru" group="Africa-Kenya" /&gt;

===Madagascar===
{{See also|Malagasy people}}
[[File:Malagasy girls Madagascar Merina.jpg|thumb|right|Malagasy ethnic [[Merina]] children]]
The population of [[Madagascar]] is primarily a mixture of various degrees of [[Austronesia]]n and [[Bantu people|Bantu]] settlers from [[Southeast Asia]] (Borneo) and [[Africa Great Lakes|Southeast Africa]] (primarily Mozambique), respectively. Years of intermarriages created the [[Malagasy people]]. They primarily speak [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], an [[Austronesian]] language with some [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] influences.

In the study of "The Dual Origin of the Malagasy in Island Southeast Asia and East Africa: Evidence from Maternal and Paternal Lineages" shows the Bantu maternal origin to be 38% and Paternal 51% while the Southeast Asian paternal to be 34% and maternal 62%.&lt;ref name="Hurles, et al" group="Africa-Madagascar" /&gt; In the study of Malagasy, autosomal DNA shows the highlanders ethnic group like [[Merina]] are almost an even mixture of Southeast Asian and Bantu origin, while the coastal ethnic group have much higher Bantu mixture in their autosomal DNA suggesting they are mixture of new Bantu migrants and the already established highlander ethnic group. Maximum-likelihood estimates favour a scenario in which Madagascar was settled approximately 1,200 years ago by a very small group of women of approximately 30.&lt;ref name="Cox, et al" group="Africa-Madagascar"&gt;[http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2012/03/15/rspb.2012.0012.full A small cohort of Island Southeast Asian women founded Madagascar], by Murray P. Cox, Michael G. Nelson, Meryanne K. Tumonggor, FranÃ§ois-X. Ricaut and Herawati Sudoyo&lt;/ref&gt; The Malagasy people existed through intermarriages between the small founding population.

Intermarriage between native [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] women and Chinese men were not uncommon.&lt;ref group="Africa-Madagascar"&gt;{{harvnb|Pan|1994|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several thousand [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] men intermarried and cohabited with Malagasy women. 98% of the Chinese traced their origin from Guangdong, specifically the Cantonese district of Shunde. For example, the census alone in 1954 census found 1,111 "irregular" Chinese-Malagasy unions and 125 legitimate, i.e., legally married, partnerships. Most offspring were registered by their mothers under a Malagasy name.

===Mauritius===
{{See also|Mauritius}}
Approximately 68% of the population is of Indo-Pakistani origin. About 25% of the population is Creole (of mixed French and African descent) and there are small numbers of people of Chinese and Franco-Mauritian descent.

===Nigeria===
{{See also|Filipinos in Nigeria}}
[[File:David Alaba 2013.JPG|thumb|100px|Austrian footballer [[David Alaba]] is of Nigerian and Filipino descent.]]
Since the 1970s, Nigeria has been a slow, but steady, increase in the immigrant [[Filipinos|Filipino]] population drawn by the oil industry. Established in 1973, the Philippine Barangay Society of Nigeria addresses issues specific to over 1700 ''Nigerized'' Filipinos living in the country. This acculturation has resulted in a small but growing, number of biracial Nigerian-Filipinos births. Most of these children are parented by Filipino mothers and Nigerian fathers.&lt;ref name="niger-wife" group="Africa-Nigeria" /&gt;

===RÃ©union===
{{See also|Cafre}}
The native [[Cafre|Kaf]] population has a diverse range of ancestry stemming from colonial Chinese and Indian peoples. They also descend from African slaves brought from countries like [[Mozambique]], [[Guinea]], [[Senegal]], [[Madagascar]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Zambia]] to the island.

===Seychelles===
{{See also|Seychellois Creole people}}
More than 70% of the native population has Afro-Asian ancestry stemming from African, Malagasy, Indian and Chinese peoples, combined with additional French and British origins. However, the demographic is specifically proud of their [[Africa]]n/[[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] heritage and have formed an institute promoting their identity and cultural tolerance.

===South Africa===
[[File:Cape-Coloured-School-Children.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cape Coloured]] school children of [[South Africa]]]]
The [[Cape Coloured]] population descend from indigenous [[Khoisan]] and [[Xhosa people]]s; [[Europe]]an immigrants and [[Madagascar|Malagasy]], [[Ceylon]]ese and [[Southeast Asia]]n (primarily Indonesian) laborers and slaves brought by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] from the mid-17th century to the late 18th century. The majority of Coloureds, particularly in the [[Western Cape]] and [[Northern Cape]], speak [[Afrikaans]] as a first language, while those in other parts of South Africa tend to speak [[English language|English]] as well. Coloureds with [[Javanese people|Javanese]] or other [[Indonesia]]n ancestry may often be regarded as [[Cape Malay]] and are primarily [[Muslims]], while the majority of Coloureds are [[Christian]] (generally [[Protestant]]) or [[agnostic]]. Due to similar social adversities experienced under the [[Apartheid]] regime from the late 1940s to the late 1980s, Coloured and Indigenous South African communities generally fall under the [[Black people|Black]] social category when it comes to [[employment]] and [[affirmative action]] policies.&lt;ref name="bbcchinese" group="Africa-South-Africa" /&gt;

====DNA of South Africa's ethnic groups====
The mtDNA study of ethnic people from South Africa shows substantial African genetic mtDNA contribution in both the [[Cape Malay]] and [[South African Indians]]. mtDNA of Cape Malay shows 10% African mtDNA contribution in their gene pool including 20% (1 in 5) of South African Indians; there appears to be no African Y-DNA contribution detected but this could be due to the fact that the sample size was small. mtDNA study also revealed that about 1 in 10 South African Black people have mtDNA lineages derived from Eurasian (3.0%) and Asian of Indian origins (7.1%).&lt;ref name="ancestry24" group="Africa-South-Africa"&gt;[http://ancestry24.com/living-history-project-results/ DNA study from ancestry24] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202044626/http://ancestry24.com/living-history-project-results/ |date=2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cape Coloureds====
{{See also|Cape Coloureds}}
There is a significant genetic mixture of European, African, Indian, and East/Southeast Asian DNA in the modern ethnic group of [[Cape Coloured]]. The highest genetic contribution to the Cape Coloured is from African maternal mtDNA displaying very high frequencies at 79.04%, followed by African Paternal Y-DNA frequencies at 45.18%. European Genetic contribution is the second highest after Africans with a high frequency of 37.72% from European Y-DNA but with a low contribution of European mtDNA at 4.26%. The Indian genetics also displayed significant frequencies, the mtDNA contribution stands at 13.85% and Y-DNA at 9.65%, and lastly the East/Southeast Asian Y-DNA in the Cape Coloured also displayed a significant frequency at 8.54% but with a very low contribution of Southeast/East Asian mtDNA at only 1.6%, some of the Southeast Asian contributions from the Cape colored gene pool may have partially derived from both Southeast/East Asian and Malagasy who both also exhibit haplogroups O1a and O2a and B4a, B5a, F1c. The only exception of the completely East/Southeast Asian lineage in Cape Coloured are haplogroup O3-M122 (3.58%) and K-M9 (1.32%) both which are found among Chinese and Southeast Asians but not among the Malagasy.&lt;ref name="group="&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2850426 | pmid=20346436 | doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2010.02.014 | volume=86 | title=Strong maternal Khoisan contribution to the South African coloured population: a case of gender-biased admixture | year=2010 | journal=Am.

==The Americas==

===Central and South America===
[[File:Wilfredo Lam.jpg|thumb|200px|Afro-Chinese-Cuban artist [[Wifredo Lam]]]]
In Central and South America, significant numbers of Chinese first started arriving in the mid-19th century as part of the [[Coolie]] slave trade. By the mid-20th century, [[Cuba]] and [[Peru]] had the largest Chinese populations. By the end of WWII, there were considerable high numbers of Central and South America descended from local women and Chinese fathers. One of the most famous of these is the Afro-Chinese-Cuban artist [[Wifredo Lam]], known as the Cuban Picasso. There are also small numbers of Central and South American residents of Asian and African descent in countries like [[Puerto Rico]], [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]].

====Cuba====
{{See also|Chinese Cubans}}
About 120,000 Cantonese coolies, all males, entered Cuba under contract for 80 years; most did not marry, but Hung Hui (1975:80) cites there was a frequency of sexual activity between black women and Cantonese coolies. According to Osberg (1965:69) the free Chinese conducted the practice of buying slave women and freeing them expressly for marriage. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Chinese men (Cantonese) engaged in sexual activity with both white and black Cuban women and from such relations many children were born. (For a British Caribbean model of Chinese cultural retention through procreation with black women, see Patterson, 322-31).&lt;ref group="Americas-Cuba"&gt;[http://www.upf.edu/mon/assig/xialmo/mat/dorsey_4.pdf Identity, Rebellion, and Social Justice Among Chinese Contract Workers in Nineteenth-Century Cuba] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220035052/http://www.upf.edu/mon/assig/xialmo/mat/dorsey_4.pdf |date=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s an additional 30,000 Cantonese and small groups of Japanese also arrived; both immigrations were exclusively male and there was rapid intermarriage with white, black and mulato populations.&lt;ref group="Americas-Cuba"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Stanley |title=Cuba: a Lonely Planet travel survival kit |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9HpqAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=9 May 2012 |date=January 1997 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=978-0-86442-403-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA World Factbook Cuba, in 2008, claimed a population of 114,240 Chinese-Cubans, with only 300 being pure Chinese.&lt;ref group="Americas-Cuba"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cu.html CIA â The World Factbook]. Cia.gov. Retrieved on 2012-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of genetic origin, admixture and asymmetry in maternal and paternal human lineages in Cuba, thirty-five Y-chromosome SNPs were typed in the 132 male individuals of the Cuban sample. The study does not include any people with some Chinese ancestry. All the samples were white and black Cubans. 2 out of 132 male sample belong to East Asian Haplogroup O2, which is found in significant frequencies among Cantonese people, is found in 1.5% of the Cuban population.&lt;ref group="Americas-Cuba"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2492877 |title=Genetic origin, admixture, and asymmetry in maternal and paternal human lineages in Cuba |pmid=18644108|year=2008|last1=Mendizabal|first1=I|last2=Sandoval|first2=K|last3=Berniell-Lee|first3=G|last4=Calafell|first4=F|last5=Salas|first5=A|last6=MartÃ­nez-Fuentes|first6=A|last7=Comas|first7=D|volume=8|page=213|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-8-213|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Cuba's most known Afro-Asians is the artist [[Wifredo Lam]].

====Haiti====
{{See also|Chinese Haitians|Marabou (ethnicity){{!}}Marabou}}
[[File:Marabou.jpg|right|thumb|A Haitian Marabou man]]
In [[Haiti]], there is a sizable percentage within the minority who are of [[Asian people|Asian]] descent. Haiti is also home to Marabou peoples, a half African and half East Indian people who descent from East Indian immigrants who arrived from other Caribbean nations, such [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] and African slave descendants. Most present-day descendants of the original Marabou are products of [[hypodescent]] and, subsequently, mostly of African in ancestry.

The country also has a sizable [[Chinese Haitians|Chinese-Haitian]] population. One of the country's most notable Afro-Asians is the late painter [[Edouard Wah]] who was born to an Afro-Haitian mother and a Chinese immigrant father. There is a small number of residents that have Japanese ancestry as well.

====Peru====
{{See also|Chinese Peruvians|Japanese Peruvians}}
About 100,000 Cantonese coolies (almost all males) in 1849 to 1874 migrated to Peru and intermarried with Peruvian women of European, African, Amerindian, mestizo and mulatto origin. Many Peruvian Chinese today are of mixed Spanish, Ameridian and Chinese lineages. Among this population exist many of [[Atlantic slave trade|African slave]] lineage. Estimates for the Chinese-Peruvian population range from about 1.3â1.6 million. Asian-Peruvians are estimated to be 3% of the population, but one source places the number of citizens with some Chinese ancestry at 4.2 million, which equates to 15% of the country's total population.&lt;ref group="Americas-Peru"&gt;[http://taste-of-peru.com/peruvian_culture/chinese.php Taste of Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927041027/http://taste-of-peru.com/peruvian_culture/chinese.php |date=27 September 2013 }}. Taste of Peru. Retrieved on 29 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
{{See also|Japanese Brazilians}}
Brazil has the largest Japanese community outside Japan and a large Chinese and Korean minority as well. The country's brown population, which includes [[multiracial|mixed race]] [[mestizo]] and [[mulatto]] Brazilians, is almost half of the entire population and it also includes people of Eurasian, Gypsy, and indigenous descent. Interracial marriages between Asians, mostly Japanese and Brazilians of African descent are less common than those between East Asians and Brazilians of European, Arab and Jewish descent, which are not uncommon and known as [[hÄfu]] or ainoko. Most East Asians live in [[SÃ£o Paulo (state)|SÃ£o Paulo]] and [[ParanÃ¡ (state)|ParanÃ¡]]. Afro-Asians can be found in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] where there is a sizeable Chinese minority as well as Vietnamese and Indonesians and [[Bahia]] where the majority of blacks live.

===The West Indies===
{{See also|Chinese Caribbeans|Dougla}}
[[File:Nicki Minaj 3, 2012.jpg|thumb|110px|[[Nicki Minaj]] is part [[Afro-Trinidadians and Tobagonians|Afro-Trinidadian]] and [[Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian|East Indian]].]]
In the 1860s, [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and East Indian [[immigration|immigrants]] arrived in the West Indies as indentured servants. Chinese male laborers and migrants went to Peru, Cuba, Haiti, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica and Trinidad where they often intermarried with local black women which resulted in a large population of racially mixed children. According to the 1946 Census from Jamaica and Trinidad alone, 12,394 Chinese were located between [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad]]. 5,515 of those who lived in [[Jamaica]] were Chinese-Jamaican and another 3,673 were Chinese-Trinidadians living in [[Trinidad]]. The Chinese men who married African women in Guyana and Trinidad Tobago were mostly Cantonese, while the Chinese men who married African women in Jamaica were mostly Hakka. In her book and documentary ''Finding Samuel Lowe: China, Jamaica, Harlem'', Afro-Chinese-Jamaican-American [[Paula Williams Madison]] explores her grandfather's life and travels. The journey ends with the reunion of the author's immediate relatives with their newly discovered extended family in [[Guangdong]], China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findingsamuellowe.com/ Williams Madison, Paula "Finding Samuel Lowe - Documentary".] findingsamuellowe.com. Retrieved on 25 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jamaica]], [[Guyana]], and [[Trinidad]], a percentage of the population of people are of [[India]]n descent, some of whom have contributed to Afro-Asian-Caribbean children.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

====Guyana====
{{See also|Chinese Guyanese|Dougla}}
During the mid-19th century, the [[British Guiana|British Empire]] imported approximately 14,000 Chinese [[indentured servant]]s into Guyana as part of a broader colonial system aimed at recruiting sugar-plantation laborers. The majority of the male workers arrived without families, thus intermarried with local [[Indo-Guyanese]] and [[Afro-Guyanese]] women.

====Trinidad and Tobago====
{{See also|Chinese Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Dougla}}
The country is known for having a large [[Indo-Caribbeans|Indian]] population stemming from the 18th and 19th-century colonial plantation economy and people of Indian descent now make up a narrow plurality. In Trinidad and Tobago, persons of African-Indian mixed descent are called "[[dougla]]s". One of the country's most notable Afro-Asians is its former President [[George Maxwell Richards]] and singer [[Nicki Minaj]].

In 1882, the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] was passed and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] workers who chose to stay in the U.S. could no longer be with their wives who stayed behind in [[Qing dynasty|China]]. Because [[White Americans]] looked at Chinese labor workers as stealing employment, they were harassed and discriminated against.

[[File:Mae-jemison.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Mae Jemison]] at the Kennedy Space Center in January 1992]]
It was discovered by historian [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] in the ''[[African American Lives]]'' documentary miniseries that [[NASA]] astronaut [[Mae Jemison]] has a significant (above 10%) genetic [[East Asian people|East Asian]] admixture. Gates speculated that the intermarriage/relations between migrant Chinese workers during the 19th century and black or African-American slaves or ex-slaves may have contributed to her ethnic genetic make-up. In the 1960s census showed 300 Chinese men married to black women and vice versa also 100.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-im2X0hbpv8C&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=Chinese+men+white+women+3500+++america&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yy2XUb_ZM4HgOO2lgdgE&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Chinese%20men%20white%20women%203500%20%20%20america&amp;f=false Love's revolution: interracial marriage] by Maria P.P.

====Contemporary China====
Currently, Afro-Asian births are on the rise resulting from the arrival of African students in cities such as [[Nanjing]], [[Hangzhou]], and [[Shanghai]]. Another contributing factor is the strengthened trade relationships between Africa and China which have invited an influx of African immigrants into China, primarily [[Nigerians]] who have formed a small, yet progressive, community in the country.&lt;ref name=Reicheneker group="Asia-China" /&gt; In October 2010, Chinese officials estimated about 500 mixed marriages between Africans and Chinese.&lt;ref group="Asia-China"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/06/china-crackdown-african-immigration|title=China cracks down on African immigrants and traders|first=Tania|last=Branigan|date=6 October 2010|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In places such as [[Africans in Guangzhou|Guangzhou]], a progressive population of about 10,000 African entrepreneurs continue to thrive.&lt;ref name=porzucki group="Asia-China" /&gt;

According to her mother, who asked not to be identified in this report, she met Lou's father while she was still in college. He left China before their daughter was born. Lou Jing's background became fodder for national gossip, sparking a vitriolic debate about race across a country that, in many respects, can be quite homogenous. There are 56 different recognized ethnic groups in China, but more than 90 percent of the population is Han Chinese. So people who look different standout.

====Slave trade and colonial era====
{{See also|Siddi}}
The more recently emerged Afro-Asian population, the [[Siddi]], resulting from the slave trade under Muslim, Portuguese, and British occupation in India between the 7th and 19th centuries. Under a slightly different slave system from that of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], slaves usually worked as domestics, [[tradesmen]] or military personnel and were encouraged to assimilate and intermarry within the existing population. With their own unique cultural identity, the population is about 50,000 strong. About a third of the Siddi reside in the state of [[Karnataka]].

In recent history, the hike in the African-Japanese population has been linked to the American occupation of Japan following the end of [[World War II]], where African-Japanese children were born through either prostitution or legally binding marriage. Thus, over the years, an increased number of African-American male/Japanese female unions has produced a culturally hybrid Black Japanese-American population living in Japan. Once given preferential treatment during the American military presence in Japan, the currently biracial population faces some severe public backlash and marginalization due to the reemergence of ethnic-based nationalism in Japan.&lt;ref name=Reicheneker group=Asia-Japan&gt;{{cite web

|quote=The products of both prostitution and legally binding marriages, these children were largely regarded as illegitimate. When the military presence returned to America, the distinction between the two was, for all practical purposes, null. As the American military departed, any previous preferential treatment for biracial people ended and was replaced with a backlash due to the return of ethnically-based national pride.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These unions between Asian women and American G.I.s have also contributed to the increase of the Afro-Asian orphan population. In some cases many Asian wives accompanied their husbands in returning to and settling in the United States. Subsequently, many African-Japanese are products of unions between native Japanese and continental Africans due to the increased numbers of immigrant Africans.

====Notables====
[[File:JERO @ Japan Society - 6-8-2012 - 18.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Afro-Japanese-American enka singer [[Jero]]]]
Notable African-Japanese include American [[author]] and [[playwright]] [[Velina Hasu Houston]] who was born in territorial waters off the coast of Japan to a native-born Japanese mother of partial Japanese ancestry and an African-American father. Popular American-born [[enka]] singer [[Jero]] was born into a multi-generational African-Japanese-American family and immigrated back to the birth country of his grandmother. He has become one of the most famous Black/African descendants in the country. There is also native-born wrestler [[Aja Kong]], former professional basketball player [[Michael Takahashi]] and pop/R&amp;B singer [[Thelma Aoyama]] who were all born to Japanese mothers and African-American fathers. Australian soccer player [[Tando Velaphi]] was born to a Japanese mother and a Zimbabwean father.

Most Afro-Asians in the Philippines are products of foreign military occupation, mainly resulting from African-American G.I. parentage. However, in 2011, ''The Nigerian Family Association'' notified the Republic of the Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs of its formation, opening membership to a growing number interracial Nigerian-Filipino/Filipino-Nigerian families and their children, living in the country.

|title = Nigerian Filipino Families Association Officers Sworn in By Phl Ambassador
|work = The Philippine Embassy in Abuja reported to the Department of Foreign Affairs that the officers of the newly formed, Abuja-based Nigerian Filipino Families Association (NFFA) were sworn in by Ambassador Nestor N. Padalhin on October 9 at the Embassy's Conference Room. The NFFA Officers, who will have a two-year tenure, are Grace Abrazado, President; Flora Adole, Vice President; Araceli Aipoh, Secretary and Communication Officer; Catalina Jibrin, Treasurer and Finance Officer; Esperanza Ogaga, Events Officer; Leony Ogu, Social Welfare Officer; and Hadiza Garba, Auditor and Logistics Officer. One of the main objectives of the association is to foster solidarity, strengthen friendship, and explore avenues of cooperation among the members of NFFA and their families, as well as with other members of the communities where they live. Membership is open to Filipinos married to Nigerians or Nigerians married to Filipinos, and their children. An annual fee of N6,000 (approximately US$40.00) to cover operating costs is to be paid by each member. In his message, Ambassador Padalhin, who wore a Nigerian attire made of adire for the occasion, congratulated the officers and members of the NFFA for their initiative in founding an association that involves their families, especially, he says, as this will ensure that the NFFA children will have more opportunities to know about Filipino culture. He mentioned about the possibility of the embassy and NFFA collaborating on cultural activities in the future. He said that while posted in Lebanon, he was instrumental in establishing the Filipino Lebanese Families Association. Meanwhile, Mrs. Abrazado said the association intends to work in cooperation with the Filipino community in Nigeria and the Embassy. She is the immediate past President of Pusong Pinoy Association (PPA), and currently the Vice President of the Abuja Branch of Nigerwives Nigeria. The swearing in was witnessed by Embassy officers and staff.

===Singapore===
Mixed marriages between ethnic Asians and foreigners are becoming more common in Singapore. While most mixed marriages between ethnic Asians and foreigners involve marriages between Asians and Europeans, some marriages have involved Asians and Africans. Afro-Asians born out of these mixed marriages have added to the mixed race population of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mixed-marriages-becoming-more-common-in-singapore&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 [[Miss Singapore Universe]] finalist Ijechi Nazirah Nwaozuzu is Afro-Asian.&lt;ref&gt;https://blasiansdefined.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/323/&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother is [[Malay Singaporeans|Malay]] with additional Portuguese, [[Indian Singaporeans|Indian]] and [[Chinese Singaporeans|Chinese]] ancestry and her father is Nigerian.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tnp.sg/lifestyle/others/miss-universe-finalists-asked-excuse-me-are-you-sporean&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, South Korea has the largest Afro-Asian population in the Far East.&lt;ref name=Reicheneker group=Asia-Japan/&gt;
The [[United States Forces Korea|U.S. occupation in South Korea]] between 1950 and 1954 resulted in a multitude of Afro-Asian births, mostly between Native South Korean women and African-American servicemen. While many of these births have been to married Black/Korean interracial couples, others have been born [[out-of-wedlock]] through prostitution. Already facing the dilemma of 85,000 children left homeless throughout the country after the [[Korean War]], South Korea saw a spike in orphaned Black Korean infants.&lt;ref name=jet24mar1955 group=Asia-Korea&gt;{{

|quote=The State Department announced that U.S. homes are needed for an estimated 200 children of Negro-Oriental romances who being "ostracized" and kept "hungry" in South Korean orphanages. The part-Negro tots, whose G.I. fathers fought with the UN forces, face a dismal future in Korea, where an estimated 85,000 children are homeless as a result of the recent war. Housed in poorly-equipped orphanages, they are "unwanted" and looked down upon by the Orientals. Government officials charged that some of the mixed-blood children are denied sufficient food by Koreans, who argue that "there is no need to give them food that is so much needed by our own children." In some places the children are not permitted to attend school. Because of the tragic situation, welfare aides believe that one of the best solutions to the problem is to bring the part-Negro orphans to the U.S. However, refugee program aide Harry B. Lyford said, "Very few inquiries have come so far from prospective adoptive parents." To spur such an adoption program, government officials announced they will help U.S. Negro families interested in adopting the children and that all inquiries should be addressed to Lyrford at the Refugee Relief Program, State Department, Washington, D.C.

Often, the Afro-Korean orphans were purposely starved, as the society deemed mixed-raced children less worthy of food needed by non-mixed Korean children. In some areas, the mixed-raced youth were even denied education. In 1955, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] made a public plea asking American families to open their doors to the ostracized youth and in 1956 the [[Holt Adoption Agency|Holt Adoption Program]] launched a gateway for Christian faith-based adoption of children of G.I. soldiers that also included Eurasian offspring. However, in addition to the race-based discrimination faced in their country of birth, Afro-Korean orphans were still passed over by adopting American families based on skin color preferences.&lt;ref name=hyunjungoh group=Asia-Korea&gt;

|quote=This was especially problematic in the case of Korean black children, whose coloring was so important to their placement. In a memo to ISS Korea, Margaret Valk asked bout the possibility of sending better quality photographs to facilitate the adoptions of Korean black children. It has also been recently suggested to us by one of the agencies who may be able to suggest some Negro families for part-Negro children that if the snapshots of part-Negro children could be taken in color as well as in black and white, this would give the families and local agency here a much better idea of the child's skin coloring and help them in the matching process. Of course, this is not foolproof at all. Some colored photographs come out much darker and some much lighter depending upon the way in which they have been taken but with the black and white photograph (which must not be omitted). The adoption agency believes they could do a better job. As you know, the color of the skin is the most important when discussing a child with a Negro family. Do you have some access to colored film in Korea or would we need to try to send this to you?}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a general stigma placed on Afro-Koreans based on illegitimacy, low socio-economic status, low educational attainment and aesthetics.&lt;ref name=Reicheneker group=Asia-Korea&gt;{{cite web

|title=The Marginalization of Afro-Asians in East Asia: Globalization and the Creation of Subculture and Hybrid Identity
|url=http://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/globaltides/vol5/iss1/6/
|work=In Korea, the majority of Amerasian and Afro-Asian children left behind after the Korean War are orphans. In Koreaâs society, like most in East Asia, success hinges on the family, particularly on the father, due to the emphasis placed upon and legacy of Confucian values. Growing up without parents or in many situations with only a mother, has left Afro-Asians ostracized by society. Low educational levels and unemployment run rampant. In his work on Black Koreans, Won Moo Hurh outlines four specific common problems they face: first, their illegitimate status, which is still heavily stigmatized in Korea. 22 Second, their motherâs presumed prostitute and low economic status is looked down upon, even though many women were legally married to their military husbands. 23 Korean society has absorbed the stereotype that all mothers of biracial children are low-class, âsexual pariahs.â 24 Third, without a strong family background, there is usually a lack of higher education and subsequent difficulty in finding work. Lastly, Hurh describes their discrimination based on appearance.25 Facing these problems of marginalization, Black Koreans have naturally taken on a negative self-image. Hurh says they âcarry the heaviestâ¦ burden of stigmas.â26.

[[Seoul]] has a non-ethnic Korean and non-Asian population of Black/African descent. Native-born, migrant and immigrant, most in this group have ties to the United States and/or the [[United States Armed Forces]]. As a result, some have deeply rooted family ties in South Korea for several generations. The population also includes black continental African immigrants. Many of them work in the South Korean education system as foreign language teachers, mainly teaching English.

One of South Korea's most notable Afro-Asians is [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] singer [[Insooni]] who was born to a Korean mother and an African-American father.

===Vietnam===
During the [[Vietnam War]], [[African Americans|African-American]] servicemen had children with local [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] women. Some of these children were abandoned by the Vietnamese family or sent to orphanages. Many orphans and children were airlifted to adopting families in the United States in 1975 during "[[Operation Babylift]]" before the fall of [[South Vietnam]]. The Afro-Vietnamese (or Afro-Amerasian) children suffered much discrimination in Vietnam at that time.&lt;ref name="Anderson" group="Asia-Vietnam"&gt;Anderson, Wanni Wibulswasdi; Lee, Robert G., [https://books.google.com/books?id=L3Yw3IU3u8sC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Displacements and Diasporas: Asians in the Americas''], Rutgers University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8135-3611-1}}. For discrimination in Vietnam, cf. p.14. "In another case study, the Vietnamese Afro-Amerasians (Lucious, this volume) suffered severe discrimination in Vietnam, being called 'children of the enemy' ..." And further on p.133, "In Vietnam, Afro-Amerasians experienced the most discrimination because their black skin was perceived as relatively darker than the skin color of other Vietnamese people (especially White Euro-Amerasians)."&lt;/ref&gt; There was also some controversy as to how these orphaned Afro-Amerasian children were placed in new homes in the United States.&lt;ref name="hicks" group="Asia-Vietnam"&gt;{{

Narang et al. (2011) examined the [[Autosome|autosomal]] [[DNA]] of Siddis in Pakistan. According to the researchers, about 58% of the Siddis' ancestry is derived from Bantu peoples.

The Afro-Asian population exemplifies Parkâs definition of marginalization, in that they are the âproduct of human migrations and socio-cultural conflict.â15 Born into relatively new territory in the area of biracial relations, there entrance into the culture of these Asian states often causes quite a stir. They also fit into Green and Goldbergâs definition of psychological marginalization, which constitutes multiple attempts at assimilation with the dominant culture followed by continued rejection. The magazine Ebony, from 1967, outlines a number of Afro-Asians in Japan who find themselves as outcasts, most of which try to find acceptance within the American military bubble, but with varying degrees of success.16

'''''Beyond the Fall of Night''''' (1990) is a novel by [[Arthur C. Clarke|Arthur&amp;nbsp;C. Clarke]] and [[Gregory Benford]]. The first part of ''Beyond the Fall of Night'' is a reprint of Clarkeâs  ''[[Against the Fall of Night]]'' while the second half is a "sequel" by Gregory Benford that takes place many years later.  This book is unrelated to ''[[The City and the Stars]]'' which is an expanded version of ''Against the Fall of Night'' which Clarke wrote himself three years after the publication of ''Against the Fall of Night''.

==Critical response==
[[James Nicoll]] described ''Beyond the Fall of Night'' as "an atrocity" and "an abomination", saying that  it is "not just a bad book, the events in it can not happen
given the events in [''Against'']", and that the only thing it had in common with ''Against'' was "some character names".&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.tv/msg/afa9a82d125ec71f?hl=en&amp;dmode=source ''The Tomorrow People''], [[James Nicoll]], July 14, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expanded version==
The 1990 novella "Beyond the Fall of Night" was later expanded into the novel ''Beyond Infinity,'' with additional material and a change in the name and gender of the character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-446-53059-0 Review: Beyond Infinity], ''Publisher's Weekly]. Retrieved 2017-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4913">[[File:Singapadu Bali Pura-Puseh-Desa-03.jpg|thumb|right|A representation of a Bhoma head guarding the top of the portal to a Balinese temple in Singapadu.]]
In a [[Balinese temple|Balinese temple architecture]],  a '''Bhoma''' is a carved or formed [[Chimera (architecture)|grotesque]] which decorates certain parts in the Balinese temple complex. The statue is similar to the Javanese [[Batara Kala|Kala]], and was intended to protect the temple complex from malevolent spirit.

==Mythology==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zilveren broche voorstellende een Bhoma monsterkop TMnr 2252-6.jpg|thumb|left|The bhoma in a silver brooch.]]
In Balinese mythology, Bhoma is the son of [[Vishnu|Dewa Wisnu]] and [[Prithvi|Dewi Pertiwi]], the god of rain and the goddess of earth. One day, when Wisnu was digging the earth in the form of [[Varaha]], his avatar in the form of a wild boar, he encountered a beautiful earth goddess named Dewi Pertiwi. The encounter leads to a union between Wisnu and Pertiwi, which produce a terrifying son named Bhoma. 

The story of Wisnu as a wild boar digging up to the bottom of the earth to meet Pertiwi symbolizes torrents of stormy rainwater entering the earth. The figure of Bhoma that was produced by this union is seen as the growth of vegetation or forest ([[Vanaspati]]) as a result of the earth receiving the (rain) water. In Javanese and Balinese culture, Vanaspati is the king of the plant, not different with the European [[Green Man]]. The word Bhoma came from the Sanskrit word ''bhaumÃ¡'', which means something that grows or is born from earth or something related to the earth.  

==Architecture==
[[File:Balinese temple pillar.jpg|thumb|left|In the [[Padmasana (shrine)|Padmasana]], the central shrine of a Balinese temple complex, the Bhoma head is carved at the bottom of Padmasana shrine to symbolize the forest which surrounds the base of a mountain.]] 
Bhoma is basically the Balinese [[kirtimukha]]. In Balinese temple architecture, Bhoma has the same function as the Javanese [[Batara Kala|Kala]] which act as a guardian spirit of the temple complex. The head of Bhoma can be found carved at the temple gate which marks the entrance to the holiest part of the shrine ([[paduraksa]]) and at the base of the padmasana, the holiest and most central shrine in the Balinese temple.

The [[Padmasana (shrine)|Padmasana]] is the holiest shrine in a Balinese temple complex. The padmasana is attributed to the Supreme God, the [[Acintya|Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa]]). Like many religious constructions in Indonesia, the shrine padmasana is divided into three sections, from the base to the top, the ''bhur'' (world of demons), ''bhuwah'' (world of men), and ''swah'' (world of gods). The head figure of Bhoma normally added the base of the padmasana, together with other monstrous figures e.g. the Bedawang Nala, the world-supporting turtle, and the two snakes, Anantaboga, and Basuki, a symbol of man's earthly needs. In this context, the head of Bhoma at the base of the padmasana symbolizes the forest which surrounds the foot of a mountain (''batur pepalihan'').{{sfn|Eiseman|2011}} 

In some Balinese houses, the doorway to some enclosed pavilion (e.g. the ''[[Balinese traditional house|bale meten]]'') is decorated with ornaments to form ventilation grill which is sometimes paneled. This is usually topped with a decorative frieze, which is sometimes carved in the form of the Bhoma's head.{{sfn|Davison|Granquist|2012}}

The head of Bhoma is also seen in the [[Ngaben|Balinese cremation towers]].{{sfn|Slattum|2003|pp=100-1}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6115">The '''British Institute for the Study of Iraq''' ('''BISI''') (formerly the '''British School of Archaeology in Iraq''') is the only body in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] devoted to research into the ancient civilizations and languages of [[Mesopotamia]]. It was founded in 1932 and its aims are to support and undertake research into the archaeology (and cognate subjects) of [[Iraq]] and the neighbouring countries from the earliest times to c. AD 1700, and to promote the cultural heritage of Iraq.  Since 1934, the School has published a refereed journal, ''Iraq'', which is now published annually, in November/December of each year.

It is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1135395}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has its headquarters in the office of the [[British Academy]] at [[Carlton House Terrace]] in London. 

==History==
The School was founded in 1932 as a memorial to the life and works of [[Gertrude Bell]]. Bell was passionate about archaeology and bequeathed Â£6,000 for its founding when she died in 1926. Further fundraising in 1929 added Â£14,000, and although the [[Great Depression]] left the fund depleted, the school was established in 1932.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jul/17/british-school-archaeology-iraq-nimrud-agatha-christie |title=The turbulent life of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq |first=Mary|last= Shepperson|date= 17 July 2018 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its initial purpose was to fund excavations by archaeologists and provide scholarship to British students working on archaeological projects in Iraq. 

The School carried out excavations in Iraq before the [[Second World War]]. Activities resumed in 1948, and the School worked continuously from then until 1990. Since then the School has been prevented by political circumstances from resuming its research activities. However, friendly relations with the Iraqi Department of [[Antiquities]] and contact with Iraqi colleagues have been maintained, mainly through private visits. 

The School was funded by a grant from the British Government starting in 1946, which allowed it to establish a base in [[Baghdad]].  Its first director was [[Max Mallowan]] whose wife was [[Agatha Christie]] who wrote ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]''. Among the notable projects the school was involved in was the excavation at [[Nimrud]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

In the aftermath of [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the school devoted its resources to assisting in the rebuilding of Iraqâs heritage. Funding from the British government however halved in 2007, and then stopped completely in 2009. It is now supported by the British Museum.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The school also receives an income from private sources. It currently has about 650 subscribing members. It is governed by a Council, which meets in London and is elected annually by the members, under Regulations approved by the original members in 1932 but recently revised. 

On 12 December 2007 the organization's name was changed to The British Institute for the Study of Iraq.  It also broadened it scope to promoting Iraqi cultural heritage and engaging in partnerships and collaborations with Iraqi archaeologists. Since the 1990s it has also funded Iraqi students studying in Britain. It helped in the creation of the [[Basra Museum]] opened in 2016.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

==Assyrian ivories==
In 2011 the BISI sold one third of its collection of [[Nimrud Ivories]], discovered between 1949 and 1963 in excavations led by Sir [[Max Mallowan]], to the [[British Museum]] for Â£1.17million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12675883 Christie ivories to go on show at British Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Another third was donated to the British Museum in recognition of the storage of the collection by the museum over the previous 24 years. It is anticipated that the remaining third of the collection will be returned to Iraq sometime in the future.&lt;ref name="artfund"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nimrud Ivories | url=http://www.artfund.org/artwork/10774/nimrud-ivories | publisher=[[Art Fund]] | accessdate=2011-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | title=Christie ivories to go on show at British Museum | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12675883 |publisher=[[BBC Online]] | accessdate=2011-03-08 | date=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A selection of the ivories was put on display at the British Museum in 2011.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

{{For|the term in media studies|Concision (media studies)}}
{{Redirect|Succinct}}
'''Concision''' (alternatively '''brevity''', '''laconicism''', '''terseness''', or '''conciseness''') is the cutting out of unnecessary words while conveying an idea. It aims to enhance communication by eliminating [[redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] without omitting important information. Concision has been described as one of the elementary principles of writing.&lt;ref name="tEoS"&gt;{{cite book |author=William Strunk |title=The Elements of Style |year=1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related concept of '''succinctness''' is the opposite of [[verbosity]].

==Description==
Concision means to be economical with words, expressing what's needed using the fewest words necessary.&lt;ref name="Concision"&gt;"What is Concision?" Accessed February 4, 2017. [https://concision.co.uk/concision/ Link.]&lt;/ref&gt; That may involve removing redundant or unnecessary phrases or replacing them with shorter ones. It is described in ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' by [[Strunk and White]] as follows:&lt;ref name="tEoS"/&gt;

{{quote|Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.|Elementary Principles of Composition, ''The Elements of Style''}}

Concision has also been described as "eliminat[ing] words that take up space without saying much."&lt;ref name="Boulder"&gt;Program for Writing and Rhetoric, University of Colorado at Boulder. "Writing Tip #27: Revising for Concision and Clarity." Accessed June 19, 2012. [http://www.colorado.edu/pwr/writingtips/27.html Link.]&lt;/ref&gt; Simple examples include replacing "{{sic|due to the fact that}}" with "because" or "at this point in time" with "now" or "currently."&lt;ref name="UNT"&gt;UNT Writing Lab. "Concision, Clarity, and Cohesion." Accessed June 19, 2012. [http://www.unt.edu/writinglab/UNTOWL_Concision_Clarity_and_Cohesion.pdf Link.]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example sentence, with explanation:&lt;ref name="Boulder"/&gt;

{{quote|'''"It is a fact that most arguments must try to convince readers, that is the audience, that the arguments are true."''' Notice the beginning of the sentence: "it is a fact that" doesn't say much; if something is a fact, just present it. So begin the sentence with "most arguments..." and turn to the next bit of overlap. Look at "readers, that is the audience"; the redundancy can be reduced to "readers" or "audience." Now we have "Most arguments must try to convince readers that the arguments are true." Let's get rid of one of the "arguments" to produce '''"Most arguments must demonstrate (their) truth to readers,"''' or a similarly straightforward expression.}}

==Example paragraph==
The following example is taken from:&lt;ref name="UNT"/&gt;

{{quote|The author of the poem illustrated various differences between the characters. The poem, which was a [[romantic poem]], showed that each individual character was sort of devious in the way in which he or she did things and behaved. The two characters in the poem, who were named Jim and Dwight, were never definitely and completely honest with each other, which led to the final outcome of them being unhappy. This outcome, which was undesirable, is designed in a way to show the readers just exactly how the author feels about lying and deceit.}}

The source suggests this replacement:

{{quote|The romantic poem showed that its characters were devious. Jim and Dwight, the poemâs two characters, were never honest with each other and ended up unhappy. This undesirable outcome shows the readers how the author feels about lying.}}

In the second quote, the same information is communicated in less than half the length. However, it could be more concisely rewritten and communicate the same information:

{{quote|The romantic poemâs characters, Jim and Dwight, were dishonest with each other and ended up unhappy, showing the author's feelings about lying.}}

==Teaching concise expression==
Concise expression, particularly in writing, is considered one of the basic goals of teaching the English language.&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Buczynski, Kristin Fontichiaro, ''Story Starters and Science Notebooking: Developing Student Thinking Through Literacy and Inquiry'' (2009), p. 7, {{ISBN|1591586860}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques to achieve concise writing are taught for students at all levels, from the introduction to writing to the preparation of PhD dissertations,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Dunleavy, ''Authoring a PhD: How to Plan, Draft, Write and Finish a Doctoral Thesis or Dissertation'' (2003), p. 273, {{ISBN|023036800X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and legal writing for law students.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Writing Institute, ''Legal Writing: The Journal of the Legal Writing Institute'' (2002), Vol. 7, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that although "in expository prose English places a high value on conciseness... [t]he value placed on conciseness... is not shared by all cultures", with, for example, the [[Thai culture]] as one where redundancy is prized as an opportunity to use additional words to demonstrate the writer's command of the language.&lt;ref name="Pacific Rim"&gt;Mark Newell Brock, Larry Walters, ''Teaching Composition Around the Pacific Rim: Politics and Pedagogy'' (1992), p. 4-5, {{ISBN|1853591602}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This may lead to a tendency for people from those cultures to use repetitive or redundant phrasing when learning English.&lt;ref name="Pacific Rim"/&gt;

==Succinctness==

The '''conservation and restoration of musical instruments''' is an action done by [[conservator-restorer]]s trained to preserve or protect historical and current musical instruments.

Musical instrument conservation, at least by the date of the earliest reference acquired, originates from 1862 when âa letter was written by [[Antonio Stradivari]], who not only 
repaired his own instruments but also those of other makers, for [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200155598/default.html Count Cesare Castelbarco] about how
to conserve his many Stradivari instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pollens|first1=Stewart|page=279|title=Stradivari|date=2010|publisher=Google Books|location=online|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dFwvjj--MsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;â Conservation practices of musical instruments follow the same guidelines as the numerous other artifacts in museum collections. During conservation, it is important to document the pre-conservation state and then the progress after those conservation actions have been completed. In order to protect musical instruments for the future, it is best to keep the collection in the most climate-controlled area.

It is important to realize that even though many instruments have to be rebuilt after a certain period of time has passed, it is acceptable to play them if they are supervised by a musical instrument conservator. Musical instrument conservation is unique because the artifacts are played and they produce sound. These instruments were historically made over the centuries to entertain all kinds of people, from royalty to the average person.

==Background==
There are many similarities between musical instrument conservation and art work protection. Like a conservator working to restore the color saturation of the water lilies in a Claude Monet painting, conservators must keep in mind the instrument makerâs integrity when cleaning or restoring any type of musical instrument (for example, luthiers create guitars and violins for guitarists or violinists), as well as the standardized policies or ethics of art conservation. According to the Code of Ethics, âII. All actions of the conservation professional must be governed by an informed respect for the cultural property, its unique character and significance, and the people or person who created it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core=documents/code-of-ehtics-and-guidelines-for-practice/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice#.VTvINSFViko|website=American Institute for Conservation of Historic Works and Artistic Works|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;â Both art conservation and musical instrument conservation require a lot of attention to detail, patience, and respect for the item or artist(s). The conservator should also be highly trained in the medium in which these items were created. For example, wood preservation or acrylic on canvas.

In general, art works are static and not moving whereas musical instruments are basically an active art tool for producing the sounds notated on sheet music in various [[Key (music)|keys]] or [[tempo]]s. Although some art objects may have more than one use and move periodically from its home institution to another museum on loan (besides providing cultural satisfaction), instruments are subject to: travel or wear and tear consistently due to continual playing. Musical instruments create art by producing sound because the human hand touches their skins, strings, [[Bow (music)|bows]], [[Fingerboard|fret board]] or [[Musical keyboard|keys.]] Musical instruments are generally used on a regular basis, during recitals and concerts by all levels of musicians.

An instrumentalist needs to keep in mind how to play their instrument carefully so that they can preserve the integrity of the instrument. That being stated, each musician performs with an instrument differently, creating their own personality and take on the capabilities of that particular instrument (ex. Louis Armstrong and his trumpet). In a sense, the partnership between instrumentalist and instrument defines them both. âPlayers demand certain kinds of physical responses from an instrument, and players and listeners alike have certain preferences about the tone produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appelbaum|first1=Barbara|title=Conservation Treatment Methodology|publisher=Elsevier|pages=145|ref=Quadrant IV- Lifetime of the Cultural Object. Lexington, KY}}&lt;/ref&gt;â

Despite how long musical instruments should last, it is important to try to maintain their playable conditions as long as possible. Similarly to automobiles that have been used on a daily basis over the years, musical instruments do not sound the same or work in the same manner that they once did when they were new. Parts wear out and at times just need to be replaced. On a side note, the average lifespan of instruments depends on the classification of them: â[[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]] or [[Brass instrument|brass]] instruments last about twenty years, while pianos last about 100 years, and string instruments for a maximum of 200 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robb|first1=Arthur|title=Conservation and Musical Instrument Making|url=http://www.art-robb.co.uk/cons.html|website=Arthur Robb- Luthier|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;" With proper conservation techniques used on instruments, they will be able to last longer than their projected lifespans.

Some music composed during the 18th century by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was for the [[harpsichord]], and if this music is to be historically understood it must be heard on an instrument of the original time period.  The Smithsonian has maintained a harpsichord that some of the resident curators can periodically play. This can be seen via the short YouTube video entitled, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1LCWOHmMQw&amp;feature=youtu.be âPlay it Again.â]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smithsonian|title=Play it Again|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1LCWOHmMQw&amp;feature=youtu.be|website=Youtube|publisher=December 10, 2013|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these Mozart compositions could be played on a piano, they would not sound the same as a harpsichord when a musician performs the piece.

[[File:Rosewood Albert System Clarinet.png|thumb|Late 19th Century Rosewood Clarinet]]
Environmental obligations exist for both musical instrument creators and conservators. This is because the materials used in instrument creation, like wood, can be on the endangered species list. âMany species of rosewood and ebony are endangered, but the wood is still easily purchased.â âSome timbers and materials used by [[luthier]]s has legal restrictions, especially when crossing international boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robb|first1=Arthur|title=Conservation and Musical Instrument Making|url=http://www.art-robb.co.uk/cons.html|website=Arthur Robb- Luthier|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;â There appears to be a mission to conserve both art or cultural artifacts and environmental conservation in the realm of musical instrument conservation.

==General care of musical instruments==
According to the Heritage Preservationâs Caring for Your Family Treasures: A Concise guide to caring for your cherished belongings by Jane S. Long and Richard W. Long,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106â113}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following eight steps are something to remember when trying to preserve oneâs instrument(s):

* âAvoid placing high tension on stringed (including keyboard) instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106â113}}&lt;/ref&gt;â 
* âAvoid sudden increases or decreases in string tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106â113}}&lt;/ref&gt;â 
* âMove pianos only on dollies and when you have enough people to do the job comfortably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106â113}}&lt;/ref&gt;â 
* Preserve the natural patina on brass instruments; donât handle them with bare hands or polish them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106â113}}&lt;/ref&gt;â 
* âKeep instruments in rooms with relative humidity at about 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106â113}}&lt;/ref&gt;â 
* âIf you play wooden-bore wind instruments, warm them up and play them in gradually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106â113}}&lt;/ref&gt;â 
* âClear the moisture from wind instruments immediately after they are played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106â113}}&lt;/ref&gt;â 
* âDo not oil or polish the surfaces of a wooden instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Jane &amp; Richard|title=Musical Instruments|date=2000|publisher=Heritage Preservation|location=Abrams, NY|pages=106â113}}&lt;/ref&gt;â

== Environmental considerations ==

In some museums, the climate controlled system in the galleries or entire architecture of the institution may need to be revamped or even replaced (depending on the age of the institution). A collections manager, or another employee from the collections department, should check to see what should be upgraded in the climate controlled system by walking around the museum and checking the status of the collection. It is their duty, along with the artifact conservators, to keep the collection safe. âSince there are over 8,000 different combinations of climate control design choices in the commercial marketplace today, it is a team process which can be divided into the three following steps: classify envelope, identify heat loads, and perform moisture inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conrad|first1=Earnest A.|title=The Realistic Preservation Environment|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/environmental-control/realistic-preservation-environment.html|website=The National Archives|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;â If a space is too warm, wooden instruments may warp.

== Climate Control ==

Since musical instruments are compiled of many organic materials such as: wood, metal, or plastic; it makes it difficult to preserve them if they are constantly on display in a museum. âPaper, leather, wood, natural fibers, and other organic materials absorb moisture; if they are kept in non-climate-controlled environments, serious conservation problems arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamb|first1=Andrew|title=To Play or Not to Play: The Ethics of Musical Instrument Conservation|journal=V &amp; A Conservation Journal|date=1995|volume=15|pages=12â15|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-15/to-play-or-not-to-play-the-ethics-of-musical-instrument-conservation/|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;â These dilemmas could include corrosion or buckling. That is why it is important to keep humidity down and at a constant temperature. Remember; âTechnical assistance from specialists in heating and ventilating engineering, the museum environment, and the conservation of musical instruments should always be sought before any major changes are considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;â

== Light limitation ==

	Similarly to how sunlight could damage the human eye, direct sunlight is harmful to artifacts too. Light makes colors fade and breaks down organic materials quickly. It is generally best not to place any artifact in a collection in direct light, whether it is natural or artificial. âLight damage is a commonly identified problem in collections, and is the subject of vast literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;â

== Storage ==

	Generally speaking, if an instrument is hung on a wall for display, it probably is rather stable because it is not moving. For musical instruments that âbelong to a study or teaching collection, orâ¦ simply be in a drawer that experiences a great deal of in-and-out movement during examination of other specimens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;â they are more at risk of being damaged because more people are interacting with them. Therefore, it is best to create limits for either human interaction or accessibility. Even easy-gliding and organized shelving could come in handy.

== Air Quality ==

	There are always pollutants in the air of museums located in a cityscape, but for rural museums, the amount could be less. The following are four of Barclay's steps &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to protect a museumâs collection from harmful air. First, âinstall air filters in the building.â Second, âabsorbent cloth, charcoal and similar materials can be placed in storage cabinets or display cases to absorb pollutants.â Third, âkeeping metal artifacts dry retards corrosion.â Lastly, âprotective coatings are occasionally applied to metal instruments.â

== Pest Control ==
[[File:Dead-Wood Borer Moth (Scolecocampa liburna).jpg|thumb|Dead-Wood Borer Moth (Scolecocampa liburna)]]
Pest control is more closely associated with climate control measures because one effects the other. Many instruments are made of wood, including: guitars, violins, violas, pianos, harpsichords, banjos, cellos, basses, etc. Therefore, wood eating insects could damage them if left in a dark, damp, and drafty space. A careful way to get rid of the infestation is through âasphyxiation by carbon dioxide or nitrogen [because they] are the preferred methods, although some work still has to be done on the effects of changes in moisture content of artifacts during treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;â

According to Robert Barclay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following are a list of the top five reasons for functional restoration. First, a restoration can be completed if âthe instrument is mass-produced.â Second, if âthe instrument has been previously restored and most ephemera has been lost.â Third, with a little bit of work from a conservator, âthe instrument can easily be put into working condition.â Fourth, âthe original function can be reestablished.â Lastly, if âthe instrument is in sturdy condition,â then it could be conserved.

== Factors against functional restoration ==
Barclay &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also mentions some explanations for not functionally restoring musical instruments and the top five reasons are as follows. First a musical instrument should not be conserved if âthe instrument is unique.â Second, work should not be completed if âthe original ephemeral features will be lost or altered.â Third, the way the instrument could be played is unknown or âthe function is obscure and unlikely to be determined as a result of restoration.â Fourth, âthe condition of the instrument is such that an accurate achievement of its original quality of function is unlikely.â Lastly, if âthe function is so well understood that no new information is likely to be gained.â

== Determining Playability ==
Playability depends on the overall strength of the architecture of the instrument as well as the musicianâs interpretation or technique of a musical score. There are always two sides to every story: those for restoring musical instruments and those that are against. âThe opponents of restoration argue that the truly authentic instrument is a reproduction of that relic, to the best of present knowledge and ability, in a state equivalent to what it was when new.â âA great deal of progress could result from making a distinction between âsoundabilityâ and playability, where the former can often be achieved without any prerequisite restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;â Therefore, who in the cultural artifact conservation world draws the line between âsoundability &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barclay|first1=Robert L.|title=The Care of Historic Musical Instruments|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimcim/resources/the-care-of-historic-musical-instruments-full-text/|website=International Council of Museums|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;â and playability?

== Classification Systems ==

There are around a handful of different classification systems known for musical instruments. From the 1960s, Curt Sachs and Erich Moritz von Hornbostelâs system for the Classification of Musical Instruments is divided into two main sections with several subcategories. The first section is âIdiophones- musical instruments in which vibrating solid material (ex. stone, wood, and metal) is used to produce sound and are differentiated according to how you make it vibrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Estrella|first1=Espie|title=Classification of Musical Instruments|url=http://musiced.about.com/od/musicinstruments/a/musicinstrument.htm|website=About Education|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;â The subcategories are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Estrella|first1=Espie|title=Classification of Musical Instruments|url=http://musiced.about.com/od/musicinstruments/a/musicinstrument.htm|website=About Education|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Concussion
# Friction
# Percussion 
# Plucked
# Scraped
# Shaken
# Stamping
# Stamped.

The second main section is âMembranophones- musical instruments that have vibrating membranes or skin that produce sound and are classified according to the instrumentâs shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Estrella|first1=Espie|title=Classification of Musical Instruments|url=http://musiced.about.com/od/musicinstruments/a/musicinstrument.htm|website=About Education|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;â The subcategories are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Estrella|first1=Espie|title=Classification of Musical Instruments|url=http://musiced.about.com/od/musicinstruments/a/musicinstrument.htm|website=About Education|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Condition reporting before and after restoration with photographs &amp; other documentation ==

	Similarly to the document(s) that a museum registrar might use to catalog an artifact into a collection, it is important to keep the proper paperwork during the conservation process being done on a musical instrument. (If interested, there is also an example of a museum condition report right [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060529/http://0338c93.netsolhost.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Condition-Report-MOCA-Cleveland.pdf here] from the Cleveland Museum of Contemporary Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Condition Report Form|url=http://0338c93.netsolhost.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Condition-Report-MOCA-Cleveland.pdf|website=The Cleveland Museum of Contemporary Art|accessdate=27 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060529/http://0338c93.netsolhost.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Condition-Report-MOCA-Cleveland.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally by taking before and after camera shots, it helps to document the steps taken by the conservator (or the rest of the conservation staff) while working on an instrument and the progress made during the duration of the project. A checklist could also help conservators stay focused on the task at hand trying to restore a particular musical instrument. But each plan is different for the conservation process depending on how severely wounded the instrument in question may be.

'''Cultural Policy Research''' (or [[Cultural policy|Cultural Policy Studies]]) is a field of academic inquiry that grew out of [[Cultural Studies]] in the 1990s. A quarter of a century later, by now both âCultural Policy Researchâ and "Cultural Policy Studies" each match almost 100 million entries in the World Wide Web.

Cultural Policy Research grew out of the idea that cultural studies should not only be critical, but also try to be useful.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Bennett, Culture, A reformer's Science, SAGE, London, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The Princeton University e.g. founded its Center for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies 1994 âto improve the clarity, accuracy and sophistication of discourse about the nation's artistic and cultural life.â&lt;ref&gt;http://www.princeton.edu/~artspol/&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific approach is genuinely interdisciplinary, combining social sciences, a wide range of the humanities, jurisprudence and economics. As all political sciences do, the research focuses on the content dimension ([[:en:policy|policy]]), the formal-institutional dimension ([[:en:polity|polity]]) and the practical dimension ([[:en:politics|politics]]), particularly affecting decision processes and the results obtained. Cultural Policy Research asks: What do the [[:en:Actor (policy debate)|actor]]s and [[:en:Structure and agency|agent]]s in the Cultural Policy sphere actually do when they do what they do? Which purposes they do pursue by that? What are their goals and which means do they use? What is the result of their action for society and for the citizensâ intellectual and artistic freedom?

Among the many departments of Cultural Policy Studies around the world, there are several UNESCO Chairs in Cultural Policy from the programme launched in 1992 by the [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref&gt;http://en.unesco.org/unitwin-unesco-chairs-programme&lt;/ref&gt; to promote international inter-university cooperation:

'''''Eating Raoul''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with music by Jed Feuer, lyrics by Boyd Graham, and a book by [[Paul Bartel]] and Richard Blackburn.  It is based on the 1982 [[Eating Raoul|movie of the same name]].

The story focuses on Mary and Paul Bland, a couple of "squares", in the late 1960s, who want to raise money to open a restaurant.  They decide to kill [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers]] for profit by hitting them on the head with a frying pan.  They become involved with a partner, Raoul, their swarthy, sexy janitor, who helps them to dispose of the bodies.  However, they soon feel trapped by Raoul and dispatch him too; he becomes the main course.

The musical opened [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[Union Square Theatre]] on May 13, 1992, starring [[Courtenay Collins]], [[Eddie Korbich]] and [[Adrian Zmed]].  It was directed by Toni Kotite and choreographed by [[Lynne Taylor-Corbett]].  Since then it has received numerous regional productions.

{{Unbalanced|date=May 2018}}'''Environmental racism''' is a term used to describe environmental injustice that occurs in practice and in policy within a racialized context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bullard|first=Robert D.|date=2001|title=Environmental Justice in the 21st Century: Race Still Matters|journal=Phylon (1960-)|volume=49|issue=3/4|pages=151â171|doi=10.2307/3132626|jstor=3132626}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1982, the term was coined by [[Benjamin Chavis]], who was the then executive director of the United Church of Christ (UCC) Commission for Racial Justice, in response to the dumping of hazardous PCB waste in a town in Warren County, North Carolina. The UCC and US General Accounting Office (GAO) reports on this case in NC brought public attention to the strong association between locations of hazardous waste sites and poor minority neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Early activists in environmental racism, Chavis and [[Robert D. Bullard|Robert Bullard]] pointed out institutionalized racism stemming from government and corporate policies that led to environmental racism. Practices like redlining, zoning, and colorblind adaptation planning,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardy|first=Dean|last2=Milligan|first2=Richard|last3=Heynen|first3=Nik|date=2017|title=Racial coastal formation: The environmental injustice of colorblind adaptation planning for sea-level rise.|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718517302944|journal=Geoforum|volume=87|pages=62â72|via=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2017.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and factors that inhibit residents from preventing these practices include their low socioeconomic status, and lack of political representation and mobility that all contribute to environmental racism.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Rozelia|date=1998|title=An Examination of International Environmental Racism Through the Lens of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes|url=http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/ijgls/vol5/iss2/14|journal=Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies|volume=5|pages=|via=Jerome Hall Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohai|first=Paul|author2=Pellow, David|author3=Roberts, J. Timmons|year=2009|title=Environmental Justice|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|volume=34|pages=405â430|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-082508-094348}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Environmental racism can be explained through a number of ways and in most cases usually include four unique patterns. The first one includes exposure to hazardous waste. It can also be identified by determining how vulnerable a community is to issues like flooding. The accessibility of potable water can also help in measuring environmental justice. Finally, a discriminatory waste management program can also be considered a case of environmental injustice. Some social scientists have argued that some causes of environmental racism are intentional, for example, the dumping of hazardous waste in a minority community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chae|first=David H.|date=2018|title=Area racism and birth outcomes among Blacks in the United States.|url=|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=199|pages=49â55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Â  Apart from intentional reasons, this kind of racism can also be caused by structural and institutional elements. Chavis defined environmental racism in five categories. First, he termed it as racial discrimination in defining environmental policies. He also stated that this occurs when these regulations and laws are being enforced. He further stated that it is the deliberate targeting of communities of color as far as dumping of toxic waste is concerned. He also referred to this term as the official sanctioning of dangerous poisons and pollutants in the minority communities. Finally, he termed it as the history of exclusion of people of color from attaining leadership positions in the ecological organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urban Geography|last=Holifield|first=Ryan|publisher=V. H. Winston &amp; Son, Inc.|year=2001|isbn=|location=Milwaukee|pages=78â90|chapter=Defining Environmental Justice and Environmental Racism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;Â  Other activists like Robert Bullard also had their own definition for the term claiming that it refers to any policy or directive that differentially harms people, groups, or even communities based on their color. 

It is also important to understand the factors that can lead to environmental racism and social scientists have identified the four main ones. They include cheap land, the absence of political authority, lack of mobility, and lastly poverty. While corporations can obtain land cheaply because of economic reasons, they can also do that because a community lacks the power to fight such companies. It is also a known fact that minority communities lack political power and this has often worked to their disadvantage. Businesses know that they can do anything in such places without any meaningful resistance. It is worth noting that politicians and lawmakers are very selective on whom they represent, and these are some of the elements that have harmed these communities. Corporations also take advantage of the lack of mobility of these people and pay them minimum wages to limit their mobility even further.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=&lt;!--editorial:no byline--&gt;|date=2018|title=Environmental racism: time to tackle social injustice.|url=|journal=The Lancet Planetary Health|volume=2|issue=11|pages=e462|via=|pmid=30396431|doi=10.1016/S2542-5196(18)30219-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;Â  It should be noted that the impoverished nature of these communities contributes to all the above factors because without money people cannot act either physically or politically.

The acknowledgement of environmental racism prompted the [[environmental justice]] social movement that began in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melosi|first=Martin|title=Equity, eco-racism and environmental history|journal=Environmental History Review |year=1995 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=1â16 |doi=10.2307/3984909 |jstor=3984909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although environmental racism has been historically tied to the environmental justice movement, throughout the years the term has dissociated more and more from the environmental justice movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ulezaka, Tara. Race and Waste: The Quest for Environmental Justice. Temple Journal of Science Technology &amp; Environmental Law.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to cases of environmental racism, grassroots organizations and campaigns have brought more attention to environmental racism in policy making and emphasize the importance of having input from minorities in policy making.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although environmental racism was coined in the US, it also occurs on the international level. Examples include the exportation of hazardous wastes to poor countries in the [[Global South]] with lax environmental policies and safety practices ([[pollution haven]]s).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Marginalized communities that do not have the socioeconomic and political means to oppose large corporations are at risk to environmentally racist practices that are detrimental and sometimes fatal to humans.Economic statuses and political positions are crucial factors when looking at environmental problems because they determine where a person lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dicochea|first=Perlita R.|date=2012|title=Discourses of Race &amp; Racism within Environmental Justice Studies: An Eco-Racial Intervention|url=|journal=Ethnicity and Race in a Changing World|volume=3|issue=2|pages=18â29|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who do not have those privileges are usually the ones who suffer from environmental problems.    

Environmental racism crosses boundaries of countries and is addressed below in the context of environmental racism that has occurred outside of the US, where the term was coined.

== Background ==
In the United States, the first report to draw a relationship between race, income, and risk of exposure to pollutants was the Council of Environmental Quality's "Annual Report to the President" in 1971, in response to toxic waste dumping in an African American community in Warren County, NC.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;United States of America. Environmental Justice Group. National Conference of State Legislatures. Environmental Justice: A Matter of Perspective. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  After protests in [[Warren County, North Carolina]], the U.S. [[General Accounting Office]] (GAO) issued a report on the case in 1983, and the [[United Church of Christ]] (UCC) commissioned a report exploring the concept in 1987 drawing a connection between race and the placement of the hazardous waste facilities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[Benjamin Chavis|Chavis, Jr., Benjamin F.]], and Charles Lee, "Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States," United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Office|first=U.S. Government Accountability|date=1983-06-14|title=Siting of Hazardous Waste Landfills and Their Correlation With Racial and Economic Status of Surrounding Communities|url=https://www.gao.gov/products/RCED-83-168|issue=RCED-83-168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perez|first=Alejandro|last2=Grafton|first2=Bernadette|last3=Mohai|first3=Paul|last4=Harden|first4=Rebecca|last5=Hintzen|first5=Katy|last6=Orvis|first6=Sara|date=October 2015|title=Evolution of the environmental justice movement: activism, formalization and differentiation|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=10|issue=10|pages=105002|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/10/10/105002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the outcry in Warren County was an important event in spurring minority, grassroots involvement in the [[environmental justice]] movement by addressing cases of environmental racism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One activist, [[Benjamin Chavis]], who at the time was the executive director of the Commission for Racial Justice of the United Church of Christ coined the term ''environmental racism'' 1982 in response to the case.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

From the groundbreaking reports on environmental racism in Warren County, NC, the accumulation of studies and reports on cases of environmental racism and injustices garnered increased public attention in the US, and eventually led to President Bill Clinton's 1994 [[Pollution_in_the_United_States#Executive_Order_12898|Executive Order 12898]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1994|title=Presidential Documents|url=https://www.archives.gov/files/federal-register/executive-orders/pdf/12898.pdf|journal=Federal Register|volume=|pages=|via=National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was a historical step in addressing environmental injustice on a policy level, especially within a predominantly white-dominated environmentalism movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/environmentalisms-racist-history|title=Environmentalismâs Racist History|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental racism was coined in the US but also exists on an international scale between countries in the [[NorthâSouth divide|Global North]] and [[Global South]], and between different races and ethnicities on different continents. Corporations in the Global North often produce dangerous chemicals banned in the United States and export them to developing countries, or send waste materials to countries with less stringent environmental laws.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Grossman, Elizabeth, ''High Tech Trash: Digital Devices, Hidden Toxics, and Human Health'' (Washington: Island Press, 2006), 185.&lt;/ref&gt; While the US approach to environmental racism emphasizes race-based discrimination and structures policies to provide equal treatment, the European approach to environmental racism focuses on changing the social conditions that result in inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-09-15|title=Issues in environmental justice within the European Union|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800911002722|journal=Ecological Economics|language=en|volume=70|issue=11|pages=1846â1853|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.06.025|issn=0921-8009|last1=Laurent|first1=Ãloi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

====Cost-benefit analysis ====
[[Cost-benefit analysis]] (CBA) is a process that places a monetary value on costs and benefits to evaluate issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/2C1D1VKF80 "Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)"], World Bank Group. n.d. Accessed: November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Environmental CBA aims to provide policy solutions for intangible products such as clean air and water by measuring a consumer's willingness to pay for these goods.  CBA contributes to environmental racism through the valuing of environmental resources based on their utility to society.  The more someone is willing to pay for a resource such as clean water or air benefits society more than when people are not willing to pay for these goods.  This creates a burden on poorer areas, however, by relocating toxic wastes and other environmentally hazardous goods through the justification that they are not willing (or able) to pay as much as a wealthier area for a clean environment.  The placement of toxic wastes near poor people lowers the property value of already cheap land.  Since the decrease in property value is less than that of a cleaner, wealthier area the monetary benefits to society are greater by dumping the toxic waste in a "low-value" area.&lt;ref&gt;Westra, Laura, and Bill E. Lawson. ''Faces of Environmental Racism: Confronting Issues of Global Justice''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Definition===

[[Benjamin Chavis|Chavis]] defined the term as "racial discrimination in environmental policy making, the enforcement of regulations and laws, the deliberate targeting of communities of color for toxic waste facilities, the official sanctioning of the life-threatening presence of poisons and pollutants in our communities, and the history of excluding people of color from leadership of the ecology movements."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Expanding the definition in "The Legacy of American Apartheid and Environmental Racism," [[Robert D. Bullard|Robert Bullard]] describes the environmental racism "refers to any policy, practice, or directive that differentially affects or disadvantages (whether intended or unintended) individuals, groups, or communities based on race or color."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bullard|first=Robert|date=Spring 1994|title=The Legacy of American Apartheid and Environmental Racism|url=https://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1460&amp;context=jcred|journal=Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development|volume=9|pages=|via=St. John's University School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four unique patterns that help identify and measure environmental injustice. Exposure to hazardous waste, how vulnerable a community is to flooding, how accessible potable water is, and discriminatory waste management processes.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1004&amp;context=anthro_faculty_pubs&lt;/ref&gt;

While some social scientists view the siting of hazardous facilities in minority communities as a demonstration of intentional racism,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Saha, Robin. 2010. "Environmental Racism". In ''Encyclopedia of Geography'', ed. Barney Warf, Sage Publications, {{DOI|10.4135/9781412939591.n379}}&lt;/ref&gt; others view the causes of environmental racism as structural and institutional.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

There are four factors leading to environmental racism: cheap land, lack of political power, lack of mobility, and finally poverty. First, cheap land is sought for economic reasons but cheap land can also be found due to lack of power in the community to resist the corporation. Second, the lack of political power carried by poor minority groups allow businesses to act with little to no resistance. Politicians and lawmakers are able to better understand communities that have the resources to make their beliefs known, unlike impoverished minority communities. Third, the lack of mobility provides a stream of workers who can be paid minimum wage and thus do not have the funds to leave the now hazardous community. Finally, the overall communities lack of money contributes to all the factors listed above and overall reduces the communities ability to act both physically and politically.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1138&amp;context=ijgls&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases of Environmental Racism by Location==

=== North America ===
In the United States, correlation between the sites of hazardous waste facilities and low-income and minority communities was publicly addressed in the 1983 [[U.S. Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) report in response to the Warren County, NC protests.&lt;ref name="gao"&gt;[http://archive.gao.gov/d48t13/121648.pdf GAO. 1983. "Siting of Hazardous Waste Landfills and Their Correlation with Racial and Economic Status of Surrounding Communities"], [[U.S. Government Accountability Office]], Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Minority communities do not have the financial means, resources, and political representation to oppose hazardous waste sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colquette | first1 = Kelly Michele | last2 = Henry Robertson | first2 = Elizabeth A. | year = 1991 | title = Environmental Racism: The Causes, Consequences, and Commendations | url = | journal = Tulane Environmental Law Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 1| page = 168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also may depend on the economic opportunities the site brings and are reluctant to oppose its location at the risk of their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, controversial projects are less likely to be sited in non-minority areas that are expected to pursue [[collective action]] and succeed in opposing the siting of hazardous waste sites and sewage treatment facilities in their area.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher M. 1995. Environmental Racism Claims brought under the Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant, Bunyan 1995"&gt;Bryant, Bunyan. "Introduction." ''Environmental justice issues, policies, and solutions''. Washington, D.C: Island, 1995. 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Processes such as [[suburbanization]], [[gentrification]], and decentralization lead to patterns of environmental racism. For example, the process of suburbanization (or [[white flight]]) consists of non-minorities leaving industrial zones for safer, cleaner, and less expensive suburban locales. Meanwhile, minority communities are left in the inner cities and in close proximity to polluted industrial zones. In these areas, unemployment is high and businesses are less likely to invest in area improvement, creating poor economic conditions for residents and reinforcing a social formation that reproduces racial inequality.&lt;ref name="pulido12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pulido|first=Laura|year=2000|title=Rethinking Environmental Racism: White Privilege and Urban Development in Southern California|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=90|issue=1|pages=12â40|doi=10.1111/0004-5608.00182|hdl=10214/1833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the poverty of property owners and residents in a municipality may be taken into consideration by hazardous waste facility developers since areas with depressed real estate values will cut expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Colquette and Robertson, 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the placement of hazardous waste facilities, minority populations experience greater exposure to harmful chemicals and suffer from health outcomes that affect their ability at work and in schools. A comprehensive study of particulate emissions across the United States, published in 2018, found that Blacks were exposed to 54% more particulate matter emissions (soot) than the average American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mikati|first=Ihab|author2=Adam F.

[[File:Bison skull pile edit.jpg|right|thumb|A pile of [[American bison]] skulls â they were hunted almost to [[extinction]] in the 1870s.  The [[United States Army]] encouraged these [[Bison hunting#19th century bison hunts and near extinction|massive hunts]] to force Native Americans off their traditional lands and into reservations further west.|260x260px]]
The [[Indian Removal Act of 1830]] and the [[Trail of Tears]] may be considered early examples of environmental racism in the United States. By 1850, all tribes east of the Mississippi had been removed to western lands, essentially confining them to "lands that were too dry, remote, or barren to attract the attention of settlers and corporations".&lt;ref name="ibid"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hooks|first1=Gregory|last2=Smith|first2=Chad L.|year=2004|title=The Treadmill of Destruction: National Sacrifice Areas and Native Americans|url=|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|volume=69|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during World War II, military facilities were often located conterminous to reservations, leading to a situation in which "a disproportionate number of the most dangerous military facilities are located near Native American lands".&lt;ref name="ibid" /&gt;

More recently, Native American lands have been used for waste disposal and illegal dumping by the US and multinational corporations.&lt;ref name="Goldtooth, Tom 1995"&gt;Goldtooth, Tom.

This included allegations that the US "deliberately and systematically permitted, aided, and abetted, solicited and conspired to commit the dumping, transportation, and location of nuclear, toxic, medical, and otherwise hazardous waste materials on Native American territories in North America and has thus created a clear and present danger to the health, safety, and physical and mental well-being of Native American People".&lt;ref name="hartford-hwp1" /&gt;

An ongoing issue for Native Americans activists is the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]]. The pipeline would start in North Dakota and travel to Illinois. Although it does not cross directly on a reservation, the pipeline is under scrutiny because it passes under a section of the Missouri river which is a key water source for Native American tribes including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The pipeline also traverses a sacred burial ground for the Standing Rock Sioux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4548566/dakota-access-pipeline-standing-rock-sioux/|title=What to Know about the Dakota Access Pipeline Protests|last1=Worland|first1=Justin|website=Time.com|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Judge James Boasberg sided with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, citing the US Army Corps of Engineers failure to complete a study on the environmental impact of an oil spill in Lake Oahe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/06/dakota-access-standing-rock-sioux-victory-court/530427/|title=The Standing Rock Sioux Claim âVictory and Vindicationâ in Court|last=Meyer|first=Robinson|date=2017-06-14|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/DAPL-order.pdf|title=Civil Action No. 16-1534|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Earth Justice|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Oct 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared the PCBs a threat to public health and required the state to remove the polluted waste. In 1979, the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources and EPA Region 4 selected Warren County as the site to deposit the PCB-contaminated soil that was collected from the roadsides.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt; Warren County is one of the six counties along the "black belt" of North Carolina. The counties residing in the "black belt" are significantly poorer than the rest of the state.

====Homer, Forest Grove, and Center Springs, Louisiana ====

In 1989, the Louisiana Energy Services (LES), a British, German and American conglomerate, conducted a nationwide search to find the "best" site to build a privately owned uranium enrichment plant. The LES claimed to use an objective scientific method to select Louisiana as the "best" place to build the plant. In response to the selection, the communities of Homer, Forest Grove and Center Springs that are nearby the proposed site formed a group called Citizens against Nuclear Trash (CANT). With the help of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund (later changed to Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund), CANT sued LES for practicing environmental racism. Finally after 8 years, on May 1, 1997, a three-judge panel of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board made their final initial decision. The panel found that racial bias did play a role in the selection process. In response to the victory, on May 11, 1997, the London Times declared, "Louisiana Blacks Win Nuclear War." The courts decision was also upheld on appeal on April 4, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bullard|first1=Robert|date=September 2001|title=Confronting Environmental Racism in the 21st Century}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flint, Michigan====
{{main article|Flint water crisis}}
Since April 2014, residents of [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], a city that is almost 57 percent black and notably impoverished, have been drinking and bathing in water that contains enough lead to meet the Environmental Protection Agency's definition of "toxic waste".  Before 2014 when the city of Flint switched to their own river as means of water, Lake Huron provided the area with water. Researchers at Virginia Tech discovered in 2015 that the [[Flint River (Michigan)|Flint River]] is 19 times more corrosive than Lake Huron. Lead contamination can engender multiple health conditions. A November 2015 class-action lawsuit describes how Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) failed to treat the new water source with an anti-corrosive agent, thereby causing the water to become increasingly discolored. This was in violation of the Lead and Copper Rule and MDEQ did not correctly complete the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated lead assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venkataraman|first=Bhawani|date=2017-12-29|title=The Paradox of Water and the Flint Crisis|journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development|language=en|volume=60|issue=1|pages=4â17|doi=10.1080/00139157.2018.1397466|issn=0013-9157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding that agent (orthophosphate) would have cost $100 per day, according to CNN, and 90 percent of the problems with Flint's water would have been averted if it had been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/racist-roots-of-flints-water-crisis_us_56b12953e4b04f9b57d7b118|title=The Racist Roots Of Flint's Water Crisis|last1=Craven|first1=Julia|date=2016-02-03|newspaper=Huffington Post|accessdate=8 November 2016|last2=Tynes|first2=Tyler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the consumption of Lead is considered among the environmental problems and some of the ways people can be exposed to it is from the corrosion of old pipes, the dust from lead-based paint and gasoline has metal dust which contains lead; but the amount of lead in gasoline has been reduced and this contributed a lot when it comes to Lead exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macey|first=Gregg P.|date=2001|title=An Investigation of Environmental Racism Claims: Testing Environmental Management Approaches with a Geographic Information System|url=|journal=Environmental Management|volume=27|issue=6|pages=893â907|via=ProQuest|pmid=11393323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an official investigation was conducted, Michigan's attorney general Bill Schuette initially filed charges against three government officials: two state officials of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, Michael Prysby and Stephen Busch, and a Flint city employee, Michael Glasglow, who was the city's water quality supervisor. They were brought up against felony charges such as "misconduct, neglect of duty, and conspiracy to tamper with evidence."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/20/465545378/lead-laced-water-in-flint-a-step-by-step-look-at-the-makings-of-a-crisis|title=Lead-Laced Water In Flint: A Step-By-Step Look At The Makings Of A Crisis|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also charged with violating the Michigan Safe Water Drinking Act.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1971, racial strains over the absence of protection for African Americans in the threatening integration endeavors prompted a mob and resulted in the capture of several black activists who would later be known as the "Wilmington Ten."

The use of the Internet in formulating an international appeal intensified dramatically after the Nigerian government's November 1995 execution of nine Ogoni activists, including [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], who was one of the founders of the nonviolent Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spitulnik|first1=Debra|title=Small Media Against Big Oil (Nigeria)|date=2011|publisher=Thousand Oaks: SAGE Publications, Inc.|page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Addressing environmental racism==
Environmental Racism can be traced back around 500 years with the arrival of the Europeans and their displacement of Native Americans. Â The [[Environmental justice|Environmental Justice Movement]], however, seems to be fairly recent having been rooted around the same time as the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]]. Â The Civil Rights Movement influenced the mobilization of people by echoing the empowerment and concern associated with political action&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=R6rj8XMSjx4C&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=environmental+racism+outrage#v=onepage&amp;q=environmental%20racism%20outrage&amp;f=false|title=From the Ground Up: Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement|last=Cole|first=Luke W.|last2=Foster|first2=Sheila R.|date=2001|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814715376|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Â Here is where the civil rights agenda and the environmental agenda met.  Despite this being the case, environmental organizations such as [[Sierra Club]] did distance themselves from cases such as the Warren County case likely because of their unwillingness to risk technical support when dealing with a very social issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGurty|first=Eileen Maura|date=1997|title=From NIMBY to Civil Rights: The Origins of the Environmental Justice Movement|journal=Environmental History|volume=2|issue=3|pages=301â323|doi=10.2307/3985352|jstor=3985352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists have called for "more participatory and citizen-centered conceptions of justice."&lt;ref&gt;Checker, Melissa. 2005. ''Polluted Promises: Environmental Racism and the Search for Justice in a Southern Town''. New York: New York University Press, pp. 122-123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="withered"&gt;Checker, Melissa. "Withered Memories: Naming and Fighting Environmental Racism in Georgia." In ''New Landscapes of Inequality: Neoliberalism and the Erosion of Democracy in America'', eds. Jane L. Collins, Micaela di Leonardo, and Brett Williams. Santa Fe, NM: School for Advanced Research Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental justice (EJ) movement and climate justice (CJ) movement address environmental racism in bringing attention and enacting change so that marginalized populations are not disproportionately vulnerable to climate change and pollution. In the US, change must be made at the federal level, and enacted upon after being passed. This requires not only state and local agencies, but also the involvement of grassroots organizations.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.triplepundit.com/special/skeo-environmental-justice/environmental-justice-policies/|title=Understanding Environmental Justice Policies|last=Lee|first=Jan|date=June 6, 2013|website=Triple Pundit|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to the [[United Nations]] Conference on Environment and Development, one possible solution is the [[precautionary principle]], which states that "where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation."&lt;ref name="rio"&gt;[http://www.unep.org/Documents.multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=78&amp;ArticleID=1163 UNCED. (5-16 June 1972). "Rio Declaration on Environment and Development", United Nations Environment Programme].&lt;/ref&gt; Under this principle, the initiator of the potentially hazardous activity is charged with demonstrating the activity's safety. Environmental justice activists also emphasize the need for waste reduction in general, which would act to reduce the overall burden.&lt;ref name="withered" /&gt;

Concentrations of ethnic or racial minorities may also foster solidarity, lending support in spite of challenges and providing the concentration of [[social capital]] necessary for grassroots activism. Citizens who are tired of being subjected to the dangers of pollution in their communities have been confronting the power structures through organized protest, legal actions, marches, civil disobedience, and other activities.&lt;ref name="Weintraub, I 1994"&gt;Weintraub, I. 1994. "[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1qx663rf.pdf Fighting Environmental Racism: A Selected Annotated Bibliography]," ''Electronic Green Journal'', Issue 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Racial minorities are often excluded from politics and urban planning (such as sea-level rise adaptation planning) so various perspectives of an issue are not included in policy making that may affect these excluded groups in the future.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In general, political participation in African American communities is correlated with the reduction of health risks and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gee | first1 = Gilbert C. | last2 = Payne-Sturges | first2 = Devon C. | year = 2004 | title = Environmental Health Disparities: A Framework Integrating Psychosocial and Environmental Concepts | url = | journal = [[Environmental Health Perspectives]] | volume = 112 | issue = 17 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.7074 | pmid = 15579407 | pmc = 1253653 | pages=1645â1653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other strategies in battling against large companies include public hearings, the elections of supporters to state and local offices, meetings with company representatives, and other efforts to bring about public awareness and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, Robert D. 1990. ''Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Equity''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addressing this global issue, activists take to various social media platforms to both raise awareness and call to action. Â The mobilization and communication between the intersectional grassroots movements where race and environmental imbalance meet has proven to be effective. The movement gained traction with the help of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat among other platforms. Â Celebrities such as [[Shailene Woodley|Shailene Woodley]], who advocated against the [[Keystone XL pipeline|Keystone XL Pipeline]], have shared their experiences including that of being arrested for protesting. Social media has allowed for a facilitated conversation between peers and the rest of the world when it comes to social justice issues not only online but in face-to-face interactions correspondingly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodges|first=Heather E.|last2=Stocking|first2=Galen|date=2015-11-01|title=A pipeline of tweets: environmental movements' use of Twitter in response to the Keystone XL pipeline|journal=Environmental Politics|language=en|volume=25|issue=2|pages=223â247|doi=10.1080/09644016.2015.1105177|issn=0964-4016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===Studies===
Studies have been important in drawing associations and public attention by exposing practices that cause marginalized communities to be more vulnerable to environmental health hazards. The US GAO study in response to the 1982 protests against the PCB landfill in Warren County was among the first groundbreaking studies that drew correlations between the racial and economic background of communities and the location of hazardous waste facilities. Their study, "Siting of Hazardous Waste Landfills and Their Correlation with Racial and Economic Status of Surrounding Communities," revealed that "three of the four commercial hazardous waste landfills in the Southeast United States were located in majority black communities." However, the study was limited in scope by only focusing on off-site hazardous waste landfills in the Southeastern United States.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Colquette and Robertson, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this limitation the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, or CRJ, directed a comprehensive national study on demographic patterns associated with the location of hazardous waste sites.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The CRJ national study conducted two examinations of areas surrounding commercial hazardous waste facilities and the location of uncontrolled toxic waste sites.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The first study examined the association between race and socio-economic status and the location of commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; After statistical analysis, the first study concluded that "the percentage of community residents that belonged to a racial or ethnic group was a stronger predictor of the level of commercial hazardous waste activity than was household income, the value of the homes, the number of uncontrolled waste sites, or the estimated amount of hazardous wastes generated by industry".&lt;ref&gt;Colquette and Robertson, 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt; The second study examined the presence of uncontrolled toxic waste sites in ethnic and racial minority communities, and found that 3 out of every 5 African and Hispanic Americans lived in communities with uncontrolled waste sites.&lt;ref&gt;Colquette and Robertson, 159-161.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies like the 1987 "Toxic Waste and Race in the United States" by the Commission for Racial Justice found race to be the most influential variable in predicting where waste facilities were located.&lt;ref name="Godsil"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Godsil|first=Rachel D.|title=Remedying Environmental Racism|journal=[[Michigan Law Review]]|year=1991|volume=90|pages=394â395}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Deserting the Perpetrator - Victim Model of studying environmental justice issues, the Economic/Environmental Justice Model utilized a sharper lens to study the many complex factors, accompanied to race, that contributes to the act of environmental racism and injustice. Using this model the role of history and the overlapping of interest groups, stakeholders, and organizations are considered in case studies of environmental racism. For example, Lerner in ''Diamond: A struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diamond: A Struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor (Urban and Industrial Environments)|last=Lerner|first=Steve|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-262-62204-2 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; not only revealed the role of race in the division of Diamond and Norco residents, but he also revealed the historical roles of the Shell Oil Company, the slave ancestry of Diamond residents, and of the history of white workers and families that were dependent upon the rewards of Shell. Involvement of outside organizations, such as the Bucket Brigade and Greenpeace, was also considered in the power that the Diamond community had when battling for environmental justice.

In wartimes, environmental racism can occur and are unearthed to the public through reports. Examining the [[IsraeliâPalestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestine conflict]], Friends of the Earth International's Environmental Nakba report brings attention to environmental racism that has occurred in the Gaza Strip. Some Israeli practices include cutting off three days of water supply to refugee Palestinians and destructing farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edblogs.columbia.edu/scppx3335-001-2014-1/2014/04/02/beyond-the-us-borders-the-palestinian-israeli-case/#more-354|title=Beyond the US Borders: The Palestinian â Israeli Case {{!}} Environmental Leadership, Action and Ethics|website=edblogs.columbia.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Besides studies that point out cases of environmental racism, studies have also provided information on how to go about changing regulations and preventing environmental racism from happening. In a study by Daum, Stoler and Grant on e-waste management in Accra, Ghana, the importance of engaging with different fields and organizations such as recycling firms, communities, and scrap metal traders, to name a few are emphasized over adaptation strategies such as bans on burning and buy-back schemes that have not caused much effect on changing practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daum|first=Kurt|last2=Stoler|first2=Justin|last3=Grant|first3=Richard J.|date=2017|title=Toward a More Sustainable Trajectory for E-Waste Policy: A Review of a Decade of E-Waste Research in Accra, Ghana|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5334689/|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=14|issue=2|pages=135|doi=10.3390/ijerph14020135|issn=1661-7827|pmc=5334689|pmid=28146075|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=September 2013|title=Environmental Nakba|url=https://www.foei.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06-foei-palestine-report-eng-lr.pdf|journal=Friends of the Earth International Report|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have also shown that since environmental laws have become prominent in the U.S. as well as Europe so companies have moved their waste towards the global south. The Third World has less of a focus on environmental concerns and therefore are susceptible to more discriminatory practices. This has not stopped activism however it has limited the effects activism has on political restrictions. As these activists push on there are still companies destroying land in these countries with harmful chemicals that are cheaper to use. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/08941920802100721|title = Third World Environmental Justice| journal=Society &amp; Natural Resources| volume=21| issue=7| pages=547â555|year = 2008|last1 = Schroeder|first1 = Richard| last2=Martin| first2=Kevin St.| last3=Wilson| first3=Bradley| last4=Sen| first4=Debarati}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activism ===
Manifestations of environmental racism predate the coining of such terminology. Before the 1970s, communities of color recognized this reality and organized against it. For example, the [[Black Panther Party]] organized survival programs that confronted the inequitable distribution of trash in predominantly black neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt; (1973). The Black Panther. Retrieved from http://www.itsabouttimebpp.com/Survival_Programs/pdf/Survival_Programs.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Young Lords]], a Puerto Rican revolutionary nationalist organization based in Chicago and New York City, protested pollution and toxic refuse present in their community via their Garbage Offensive program. These and other organizations also worked to confront the maldistribution of open spaces, toxic lead paint, and healthy food options.&lt;ref&gt;Enck-Wanzer, D. (2010). ''The Young Lords: A Reader''. New York: New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt; They also offered health programs to those affected by preventable, environmentally induced diseases such as tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Enck-Wanzer, D. (2010). ''The Young Lords: A Reader''. New York: New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
In this way, these organizations serve as precursors to more pointed movements against environmental racism.

[[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr]]. helped to bring light to the injustices done to many low-income neighborhoods and the working conditions of African-Americans. In the year before his assassination, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was in the midst of organizing a protest in Washington to create a bill to help the poor and homeless in the United States. After his assassination Â and even with the push of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), this bill would never come to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/martin-luther-king-jr---8-peaceful-protests-that-bolstered-civil-rights.html|title=Martin Luther King Jr.: 8 peaceful protests that bolstered civil rights|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latino ranch laborers composed by Cesar Chavez battled for working environment rights, including insurance from harmful pesticides in the homestead fields of California's San Joaquin Valley. In 1967, African-American understudies rioted in the streets of Houston to battle a city trash dump in their locale which had killed two kids. In 1968, occupants of West Harlem, in New York City, battled unsuccessfully against the siting of a sewage treatment plant in their neighborhood. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrdc.org/stories/environmental-justice-movement|title=The Environmental Justice Movement|work=NRDC|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach in activism is promoting the development and manufacturing of renewable energy sources and the integration of health, economic and preparedness issues into climate policies. However, despite President Bill Clintonâs executive order 12898, there remains differences between policy and action that advocacy groups continue to address.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White-Newsome|first=Jalonne Lynay|date=2016-07-02|title=A Policy Approach Toward Climate Justice|journal=The Black Scholar|language=en|volume=46|issue=3|pages=12â26|doi=10.1080/00064246.2016.1188353|issn=0006-4246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With time environmental justice and civil rights movements fused together and as a result environmental justice organizations stood up for more ethnic groups and this increased diversity within the organization. The fusion is very logical since the people who suffer the most are minority groups. One of the main environmental problems that minority groups suffer from is uncontrolled toxic wastes. The factor that initiated environmental justice is the relationship between the geography of minority groups and hazardous waste landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rdcu.be/bb1lL|title=Cities in the new millennium: Environmental justice, the spatialization of race, and combating anti-urbanism|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When environmental racism became acknowledged in the US society, it stimulated the environmental justice social movement that gained wave throughout the 1970s and 1980s in the US. Historically, the term environmental racism has had ties with the environmental justice movement.Â  However, this has changed with time to the extent it is believed to lack any associations with the movement. Grassroots organizations and campaigns have sprung up in response to this environmental racism with these groups mainly demanding the inclusion of minorities when it comes to policy making involving the environment. It is also worth noting that this concept is international despite being coined in the US. A perfect example is when the United States exported its hazardous wastes to the poor nations in the Global South because they knew that these countries had lax environmental regulations and safety practices. Marginalized communities are usually at risk of environmental racism because they resource and means to oppose the large companies that dump these dangerous wastes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;Â  As already stated, environmental racism is international, implying that it not only occurs in the United States. 

===Policies and International agreements===
The [[global waste trade|export of hazardous waste]] to third world countries is another growing concern. Between 1989 and 1994, an estimated 2,611 metric tons of hazardous waste was exported from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to non-OECD countries. Two international agreements were passed in response to the growing exportation of hazardous waste into their borders. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) was concerned that the Basel Convention adopted in March 1989 did not include a total ban on the trans-boundary movement on hazardous waste. In response to their concerns, on January 30, 1991, the Pan-African Conference on Environmental and Sustainable Development adopted the Bamako Convention banning the import of all hazardous waste into Africa and limiting their movement within the continent. In September 1995, the G-77 nations helped amend the Basel Convention to ban the export of all hazardous waste from industrial countries (mainly OECD countries and Lichtenstein) to other countries.&lt;ref name=Bullard&gt;{{cite web|last=Bullard |first=Robert |title=Confronting Environmental Racism in the Twenty-First Century |url=http://www.worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=179 |publisher=Global Dialogue |accessdate=November 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041754/http://www.worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=179 |archivedate=April 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[globalization]] and the increase in transnational agreements, introduce possibilities for cases of environmental racism. For example, the 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) attracted US-owned factories to Mexico, where toxic waste was abandoned in the Colonia Chilpancingo community and was not cleaned up until activists called for the Mexican government to clean up the waste.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the US, the environmental justice movement uses the Civil Rights Act (CRA) of 1964 to combat environmental racism in legal cases. For example, the CRA was used in the 1994 lawsuit against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority which failed to provide services for poor LA County residents.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Canada, progress is being made to address environmental racism (especially in Nova Scotia's [[Africville]] community) with the passing of Bill 111, An Act to Address Environmental Racism in the Nova Scotia Legislature.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

In response to fatal diesel pollution in the air around ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach in 2006, the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan, or CAAP, was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Juan De Lara (2018) [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24694452.2017.1393328 âThis Port Is Killing Peopleâ]: Sustainability without Justice in the Neo-Keynesian Green City, Annals of the American Association of Geographers, 108:2, 538-548, DOI: 10.1080/24694452.2017.1393328&lt;/ref&gt; The action plan was created to reduce pollution caused by ports; specifically, it demanded a 45% decrease in pollution once the proposal was put into action. &lt;ref&gt;De Lara 2017, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt; Another layer of the planâs objective was to reduce negative environmental impacts from trucks with the initial plans for the Clean Truck Program (CTP), which intended to cut back on the use of shipping trucks from the docks and instead called for purer options like rail yards and warehouses that could hopefully improve the air quality. &lt;ref&gt;De Lara 2017, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fashion show''' ([[French language|French]] ''dÃ©filÃ© de mode'') is an event put on by a [[fashion designer]] to showcase their upcoming line of [[clothing]] and/or accessories during [[Fashion Week]].  Fashion shows debut every season, particularly the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter seasons. This is where the latest fashion trends are made. The two most influential fashion weeks are [[Paris Fashion Week]] and [[New York Fashion Week]], which are both semiannual events.The [[Milan Fashion Week|Milan]], [[London Fashion Week|London]], [[Feeric Fashion Week|Sibiu]] and [[Berlin Fashion Week|Berlin]] fashion weeks are also of global importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradford|first1=Julie|title=Fashion Journalism|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2xeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Susan|last=Dillon|title=The Fundamentals of Fashion Management|publisher= A&amp;C Black|year=2011|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XFMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a typical fashion show, [[fashion model|models]] walk the [[Catwalks|catwalk]] dressed in the clothing created by the designer.  Clothing is illuminated on the runway using various forms of lighting and special effects. The order in which each model walks out wearing a specific outfit, is usually planned in accordance to the statement that the designer wants to make about their collection. It is then up to the audience to not only try to understand what the designer is trying to say, but to also visually deconstruct each outfit and try to appreciate the detail and craftsmanship of every single piece.

Occasionally, fashion shows take the form of installations, where the models are static, standing or sitting in a constructed environment. A wide range of contemporary designers tend to produce their shows as theatrical productions with elaborate sets and added elements such as live music or a variety of technological components like [[hologram]]s, for example.

==History==
Because "the topic of fashion shows remains to find its historian",&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Steele, chief curator and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, quoted in Fortini, Amanda. [http://www.slate.com/id/2135561/ How the Runway Took Off: A Brief History of the Fashion Show.]  ''Slate'' Magazine (February 8, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest history of fashion shows remains obscure.

In the 1800s, "fashion parades" periodically took place in [[Paris]] [[haute couture|couture]] salons.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;Fortini, Amanda. [http://www.slate.com/id/2135561/ How the Runway Took Off: A Brief History of the Fashion Show.]  Slate Magazine (February 8, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States|American]] [[retailer]]s imported the concept of the fashion show in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;  The first American fashion show likely took place in 1903 in the [[New York City]] store of the [[Ehrlich Brothers]].&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;  By 1910, large department stores such as [[Wanamaker's]] in New York City and [[Philadelphia]] were also staging fashion shows.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;  These events showed couture gowns from Paris or the store's copies of them; they aimed to demonstrate the owners' good taste and capture the attention of female shoppers.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;

By the 1920s, retailers across the United States held fashion shows.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;  Often, these shows were theatrical, presented with narratives, and organized around a theme (e.g. Parisian, Chinese, or Russian).&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;  These shows enjoyed huge popularity through mid-century, sometimes attracting thousands of customers and gawkers.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;
[[File:Chanel Haute Couture Fall-Winter 2011.jpg|thumb|Example of an elaborate stage set used for the Chanel Haute Couture Fall-Winter 2011 show]]

In the 1970s and 1980s, American designers began to hold their own fashion shows in private spaces apart from such retailers.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;  In the early 1990s, however, many in the fashion world began to rethink this strategy.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;  After several mishaps during shows in small, unsafe locations, "[t]he general sentiment was, 'We love fashion but we don't want to die for it,'" recalls [[Fern Mallis]], then executive director of the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]].&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;  In response to these shows, the New York shows were centralized in [[Bryant Park]] during [[New York Fashion Week|fashion week]] in late 1993.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;

Lately from the 2000s to today, fashion shows are usually also filmed and appear on specially assigned television channels or even in documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tao NÃ¸rager#Bible Black|Bible Black, a documentary on a fashion show held by Andrew Mackenzie]]  Urban.dk, November 13, 2008, artikel-id: e14a0053 (November 11, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, fashion shows have become increasingly elaborate for many of the top labels, including sprawling sets that often come with higher costs.&lt;ref name=fashion_shows&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murrow|first1=Laura|title=Transplanted Trees, Paper Kingdoms, and Flames: The Best Fashion Week Set Design|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2012/03/best-fashion-week-set-design.html|website=The Cut|publisher=New York Media LLC|accessdate=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some designers have attempted to modernize the style and presentation of fashion shows by integrating technological advances in experimental ways, such as including pre-recorded digital videos as backdrops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashionista.com/2014/09/technology-new-york-fashion-week-spring-2015 |title=NEW YORK FASHION WEEK EXPLORES TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN FASHION |website=Fashionista.com |accessdate=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During New York Fashion Week in 2014, designer [[Ralph Lauren]]&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; presented his new Polo line for Spring 2015 in a water-screen projection in Manhattanâs Central Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.ralphlauren.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=65933&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1965009 |title=Press Releases - Press Releases - Ralph Lauren Investor Relations |website=Investor.ralphlauren.com |date=2014-09-08 |accessdate=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technological progress has also allowed a broader portion of the fashion industry's followers to experience shows. In 2010, London Fashion Week was the first fashion week to allow viewing of its shows through [[live streaming]].&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alex Wood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/sep/12/london-fashion-week-technology-burberry |title=London fashion week: why technology is in fashion &amp;#124; Media Network |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Live streaming of runway shows and mediated shows has now become commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashiongps.com/5-technology-trends-transforming-the-fashion-industry/ |title=Posts &amp;#124; Launchmetrics |website=Fashiongps.com |date=2014-03-25 |accessdate=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fortnum &amp; Mason''' (colloquially often shortened to just '''"Fortnum's"''') is an [[Luxury goods|upmarket]] [[department store]] in [[Piccadilly]], [[London]], with additional stores at [[St Pancras railway station]] and [[Heathrow Airport]] in London, as well as various stockists worldwide.  Its headquarters are located at 181 Piccadilly, where it was established in 1707 by William Fortnum and Hugh Mason. Today, it is privately owned by [[Wittington Investments]] Ltd.

Founded as a grocery store, Fortnum's reputation was built on supplying quality food, and saw rapid growth throughout the Victorian era.  Though Fortnum's developed into a department store, it continues to focus on stocking a variety of exotic, speciality and also 'basic' provisions.&lt;ref name="gershman"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OO8CqRensxcC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Fortnum+%26+Mason&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=Fortnum%20%26%20Mason&amp;f=false| author=[[Suzy Gershman]]| title=Born to Shop London| publisher=Wiley Publishing, Inc.| location=Hoboken, NJ| isbn=978-0-7645-9891-3 |accessdate=5 February 2013| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The store has since opened several other departments, such as the Gentlemen's department on the third floor. It is also the location of a tea shop and several restaurants.

==History==
[[File:Fortnum &amp; Mason 20130408 084.jpg|thumb|left|Fortnum &amp; Mason]]
William Fortnum was a [[footman]] in the [[royal household|household]] of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. The royal familyâs insistence on having new candles every night resulted in large amounts of half-used wax, which Fortnum promptly resold for a tidy profit. The enterprising Fortnum also had a sideline business as a grocer. He convinced his landlord, Hugh Mason, to be his associate, and they founded the first Fortnum &amp; Mason store in Mason's small shop in St James's Market in 1707. In 1761, William Fortnum's grandson Charles went into the service of [[Queen Charlotte]] and the affiliation with the royal court led to an increase in business. Fortnum &amp; Mason claims to have invented the [[Scotch egg]] in 1738.&lt;ref name="egg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Single Hen Scotch Egg |publisher=Fortnum &amp; Mason |url=http://www.fortnumandmason.com/p-5251-single-hen-scotch-egg.aspx |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glancey"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/05/foodanddrink.shopping |location=London |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=A facial at Fortnums? Never! |first=Jonathan |last=Glancey |date=5 November 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The store began to stock speciality items, namely ready-to-eat luxury meals such as fresh poultry or [[game (food)|game]] served in [[aspic|aspic jelly]].&lt;ref name="Open"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fortnumandmason.com/c-359-1700s-fortnum-and-mason.aspx?|title=1700s |publisher=F&amp;M |accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fortnum&amp;Mason Fruit and Flowers2.jpg|thumb|left|The fruit and flowers section on the ground floor of Fortnum and Mason]]

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the emporium supplied [[dried fruit]], spices and other [[preserves]] to British [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] and during the [[Victorian era]] it was frequently called upon to provide food for prestigious court functions. [[Queen Victoria]] even sent shipments of Fortnum &amp; Mason's concentrated [[beef tea]] to [[Florence Nightingale|Florence Nightingale's]] hospitals during the [[Crimean War]].&lt;ref name="Waterloo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fortnumandmason.com/c-360-1800s-fortnum-and-mason.aspx |title=1800s| publisher=F&amp;M |accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fortnum &amp; Mason 2014 (3).JPG|thumb|upright|Main staircase inside]]

[[Charles Drury Edward Fortnum]] [[List of Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London|F.S.A.]] (1820â1899), of the family, was a distinguished art collector and a Trustee of the [[British Museum]], to which he donated his collection of Islamic [[ceramic art|ceramics]].&lt;ref name="charles"&gt;{{cite web| title=Dictionary of Art Historians| url=http://arthistorians.info/fortnumc| author=Lee Sorensen| publisher=arthistorians.info| accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, after having bought the entire stock of five cases of a new product made by [[H. J. Heinz Company|H. J. Heinz]], Fortnum &amp; Mason became the first store in Britain to stock tins of [[baked beans]].&lt;ref name="Waterloo"/&gt;

[[File:Fortnum and Mason (1).jpg|thumb|left|The mechanical clock on the main faÃ§ade]]

In April 1951, the Canadian businessman [[W. Garfield Weston]] acquired the store and became its chairman following a [[boardroom coup]].&lt;ref name="ampthill"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/theatre-obituaries/8474838/Lord-Ampthill.html |title=Lord Ampthill |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, he commissioned a four-ton clock to be installed above the main entrance of the store as a tribute to its founders. Every hour, {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} models of William Fortnum and Hugh Mason emerge and bow to each other, with chimes and [[Classical period (music)|18th-centuryâstyle]] music playing in the background. Since Garfield Weston's death in 1978, the store has been run by his granddaughters, [[Jana Khayat]] and Kate Weston Hobhouse. The Managing Director is Ewan Venters.

The store underwent a Â£24 million refurbishment in 2007 as part of its tercentenary celebrations.&lt;ref name="FreshFood"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fortnumandmason.com/c-362-today-fortnum-and-mason.aspx? |title=2007 |publisher=F&amp;M |date=11 May 2006 |accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]], [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]] made their first official joint visit to Fortnum &amp; Mason. During this visit, they were each presented with their own personalized hampers. &lt;ref name="visit"&gt;{{cite news| title=The Queen, Catherine and Camilla visit Fortnum &amp; Mason| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17220250| work=[[BBC News]]| publisher=BBC.com| date=1 March 2012| accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen opened the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee Tea Salon]] on the fourth floor.

In November 2013, an additional store was opened at St Pancras International station, the first new store in the UK.&lt;ref name="newshop"&gt;{{cite news| title=Fortnum &amp; Mason to open first new store in 307 years| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10101165/Fortnum-and-Mason-to-open-first-new-store-in-307-years.html| work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| publisher=telegraph.co.uk/| date=11 June 2013| accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortnum &amp; Mason opened its first standalone store outside Britain in Dubai on 21 March 2014.

==Controversy==
In November 2010, animal rights group [[PETA UK]] began a campaign against Fortnum &amp; Masonâs sale of [[foie gras]] citing the "cruelty" in the production process. The group regularly holds demonstrations involving celebrities, activists and volunteers outside the store. Celebrities supporting the campaign include [[Geezer Butler]], [[Roger Moore|Sir Roger Moore]],&lt;ref name="Sir Roger Moore speaks out against Fortnum &amp; Mason's foie gras sales"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.peta.org.uk/2010/12/sir-roger-moore-says-foie-gras-is-cruel-not-yule/ |title=Sir Roger Moore Says, 'Foie Gras Is Cruel, Not Yule' |publisher=PETA |date=24 December 2010 |accessdate=7 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327121137/http://blog.peta.org.uk/2010/12/sir-roger-moore-says-foie-gras-is-cruel-not-yule/ |archivedate=27 March 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owain Yeoman]],&lt;ref name="Yeoman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/entertainment/Owain+Yeoman-95565.html |title=Owain Yeoman Joins Foie Gras |publisher=Female First |date=16 June 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tamara Ecclestone]],&lt;ref name="Tamara"&gt;{{cite news| title=Tamara Ecclestone: âIâve got a basic palate and simple needsâ| url=http://www.croatiantimes.com/news/Panorama/2009-12-02/7545/Tamara_Ecclestone_strips_off_for_animal_cruelty_campaign| date=2 December 2009| accessdate=5 February 2013| work=[[Croatian Times]]| publisher=croatiantimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Oddie]],&lt;ref name="Naughty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.peta.org.uk/2011/11/bill-santa-oddie-delivers-bag-of-coal-to-naughty-fortnum-mason/ |title=Bill âSantaâ Oddie Delivers Bag of Coal to âNaughtyâ Fortnum &amp; Mason |publisher=PETA |date=10 November 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218094344/http://blog.peta.org.uk/2011/11/bill-santa-oddie-delivers-bag-of-coal-to-naughty-fortnum-mason/ |archivedate=18 December 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twiggy]]&lt;ref name="Twiggy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/twiggy-steps-up-foie-gras-campaign_1227651 |title=Twiggy Steps Up Foie Gras Campaign |publisher=Contactmusic |date=23 June 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Morrissey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.peta.org.uk/2013/07/morrissey-vs-gordon-ramsay-in-foie-gras-fracas/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814042119/http://blog.peta.org.uk/2013/07/morrissey-vs-gordon-ramsay-in-foie-gras-fracas/ |archivedate=14 August 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortnum &amp; Mason has recently been reprimanded by Westminster Trading Standards for misleading customers about its animal welfare standards.&lt;ref name="reprimand"&gt;{{cite news| title=Fortnum and Mason faces celebrity battle over its sale of 'cruel' foie gras| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/18/fortnum-mason-foie-gras-protest| work=[[The Observer]]| publisher=guardian.co.uk| date=17 December 2011| author=Jamie Doward and Jemima Owen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the grocer has changed its corporate social responsibility document to state that only UK suppliers are required to adhere to its welfare standards.

On 26 March 2011, Fortnum &amp; Mason was targeted by the group [[UK Uncut]], who broke off from the main [[2011 anti-cuts protest in London|2011 anti-cuts protest]] march to target the [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax avoidance policies]] of Associated British Foods, which, like Fortnum &amp; Mason, is owned by [[Wittington Investments]].&lt;ref name="Uncut"&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/blog/press-release-uk-uncut-occupy-tax-dodgers-fortnum-and-mason| title=UK Uncut Occupy Tax Dodgers Fortnum and Mason| date=26 March 2011| publisher=ukuncut.org.uk| accessdate=5 February 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110329141844/http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/blog/press-release-uk-uncut-occupy-tax-dodgers-fortnum-and-mason| archivedate=29 March 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This took the form of a mass [[sit-in]], with some 138 UK Uncut protesters being arrested.&lt;ref name="sitin"&gt;{{cite AV media| title=Occupation of Fortnum &amp; Mason by UKuncut was peaceful| url=http://liberalconspiracy.org/2011/03/27/watch-ukuncut-occupation-of-fortnum-mason-was-peaceful/| people=Sunny Hundal| date=27 March 2011| publisher=liberalconspiracy.org| accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fortnum's London Dry Gin==

On 14 November 2014, Fortnum &amp; Mason released a rebranded and redeveloped [[London Dry Gin]] created as a partnership brand by [[The London Distillery Company]] Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.londondistillery.com|title=The London Distillery Company|first=|last=Enjoythis|website=www.londondistillery.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London Distillery Company was approached by Fortnum and Mason in September 2014 to undertake the rebrand following continued in-store success of Dodd's Gin, which was created as a tribute to an 18th-century engineer and [[entrepreneur]], [[Ralph Dodd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fortnumandmason.com/c-1752-the-story-of-our-exclusive-gin.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150107022139/http://www.fortnumandmason.com/c-1752-the-story-of-our-exclusive-gin.aspx |archivedate=7 January 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design agency United Creatives were commissioned by The London Distillery Company CEO Darren Rook to undertake the label rebrand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedcreatives.com/all/article.php?articleid=13|title=United Creatives -- Designers.

'''Giovanni Battista''' (or '''Giambattista''') '''Piranesi''' ({{IPA-it|dÊoËvanni batËtista piraËneËzi; -eËsi}}; also known as simply '''Piranesi'''; 4 October 1720 â 9 November 1778) was an Italian artist famous for his [[etching]]s of [[Rome]] and of fictitious and atmospheric "prisons" (''Le Carceri d'Invenzione'').

==Biography==
Piranesi was born in [[Mogliano Veneto]], near [[Treviso]], then part of the [[Republic of Venice]]. His father was a stonemason. His brother Andrea introduced him to [[Latin language]] and the ancient civilization, and later he was apprenticed under his uncle, [[Matteo Lucchesi]], who was a leading architect in ''Magistrato delle Acque'', the state organization responsible for engineering and restoring historical buildings.

From 1740, he had an opportunity to work in Rome as a draughtsman for Marco Foscarini, the Venetian ambassador of the new Pope Benedict XIV. He resided in the [[Palazzo Venezia]] and studied under [[Giuseppe Vasi]], who introduced him to the art of etching and [[engraving]] of the city and its monuments. Giuseppe Vasi found Piranesi's talent was beyond engraving. According to Legrand, Vasi told Piranesi that "you are too much of a painter, my friend, to be an engraver."

After his studies with Vasi, he collaborated with pupils of the [[French Academy in Rome]] to produce a series of ''vedute'' (views) of the city; his first work was ''Prima parte di Architettura e Prospettive'' (1743), followed in 1745 by ''Varie Vedute di Roma Antica e Moderna''.

From 1743 to 1747 he sojourned mainly in Venice where, according to some sources, he often visited [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], a leading artist in Venice. It was Tiepolo who expanded the restrictive conventions of reproductive, topographical and antiquarian engravings. He then returned to Rome, where he opened a workshop in [[Via del Corso]]. In 1748â1774 he created a long series of ''[[vedute]]'' of the city which established his fame. In the meantime Piranesi devoted himself to the measurement of many of the ancient edifices: this led to the publication of ''Le AntichitÃ  Romane de' tempo della prima Repubblica e dei primi imperatori'' ("Roman Antiquities of the Time of the First Republic and the First Emperors"). In 1761 he became a member of the [[Accademia di San Luca]] and opened a printing facility of his own. In 1762 the ''Campo Marzio dell'antica Roma'' collection of engravings was printed.

The following year he was commissioned by [[Pope Clement XIII]] to restore the choir of [[San Giovanni in Laterano]], but the work did not materialize. In 1764, one of Pope's nephews, Cardinal Rezzonico, appointed him to start his sole architectural works of importance, the restoration of the church of [[Santa Maria del Priorato]] in the Villa of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]], on Rome's [[Aventine Hill]]. He combined certain ancient architectural elements, trophies and escutcheons, with a venetian whimsicality for the facade of the church and the walls of the Piazza dei Cavalieri di Malta. This was the only time he expressed himself in actual marble and stone.

In 1767 he was made a [[Order of the Golden Spur|knight of the Golden Spur]], which enabled him henceforth to sign himself "Cav[aliere] Piranesi".  In 1769 his publication of a series of ingenious and sometimes bizarre designs for chimneypieces, as well as an original range of furniture pieces, established his place as a versatile and resourceful designer.&lt;ref&gt;Wilton-Ely, John.

He died in Rome in 1778 after a long illness, and was buried in the Church he had helped restore, Santa Maria del Priorato. His tomb was designed by [[Giuseppi Angelini (sculptor)|Giuseppi Angelini]].

==The ''Views'' (''Vedute'')==
[[File:Giovanni Battista Piranesi, The Colosseum.png|thumb|left|''The [[Colosseum]]'', etching, 1757]]
Even though the social structure by an aristocracy remained rigid and oppressive, Venice revived through the [[Grand Tour]] as the center of intellectual and international exchange in the eighteenth century. The ideas of the Enlightenment stimulated theorists and artists all over Europe including Paris, Dresden, and London. New forms of artistic expression emerged: veduta, capriccio, and veduta ideata, topographical view, architectural fantasy, accurate renderings of ancient monuments assembled with imaginary compositions in response to the demand of increased visitors.

The developing center of the Grand Tour was Rome. Rome became a new meeting place and intellectual capital of Europe for the leaders of a new movement in the arts. The city was attracting artists and architects from all over Europe beside the Grand Tourists, dealers and antiquarians. While many came through official institutions such as the French Academy, others came to see the new discoveries at [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]]. Coffee shops were frequent gathering places, most famously the [[Antico CaffÃ¨ Greco]], established 1760. The Caffe degli Inglesi opened several years later, at the foot of the Spanish Steps in [[Piazza di Spagna]], with wall paintings by Piranesi. With his own print workshop and museo of antiquities nearby, Piranesi was able to cultivate relationships in both places with wealthy buyers on the tour, particularly English.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Adam. [https://artinprint.org/article/messing-about-with-masterpieces/ "Messing About With Masterpieces: New Work by Giambattista Piranesi (1720-1778),"] ''Art in Print'' Vol. 1 No. 1 (May-June 2011), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of Rome kindled Piranesi's enthusiasm. Informed by his experience in Venice and his study of the works of [[Marco Ricci]] and particularly [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]], he appreciated not only the engineering of the ancient buildings but also the poetic aspects of the ruins. He was able to faithfully imitate the actual remains; his invention in catching the [[Roman architecture|design of the original architect]] provided the missing parts. His masterful skill at engraving introduced groups of vases, altars, tombs that were absent in reality; his manipulations of scale; and his broad and scientific distribution of light and shade completed the picture, creating a striking effect from the whole view. Some of his later work was completed by his children and several pupils.

Piranesi's son and coadjutor, [[Francesco Piranesi|Francesco]], collected and preserved his plates, in which the freer lines of the etching-needle largely supplemented the severity of [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] work. Twenty-nine folio volumes containing about 2000 prints appeared in Paris (1835â1837).

The late [[Baroque]] works of [[Claude Lorrain]], [[Salvatore Rosa]], and others had featured romantic and fantastic depictions of ruins; in part as a [[memento mori]] or as a reminiscence of a golden age of construction. Piranesi's reproductions of real and recreated Roman ruins were a strong influence on [[Neoclassicism]].

One of the main features of Neo-Classicism is the attitude towards nature and the uses of the past. Neo-Classicism was prompted by the discoveries at Herculaneum and Pompeii. Rediscovery and revaluation of Greece, Egypt, and Gothic was also active as well as the various expeditions of unfamiliar Roman empire. The view of a Golden Age was changing from static to mutable, inspired by Rousseau and Winckelmann in response to the dynamic growth of society.

The wider perspective on the past created a new way of expression. Artists developed a greater self-consciousness in confronting the limited authority of the ancient world, and there was a growing interest in civilizations and the destiny of nations. Piranesi was especially interested in the Graeco-Roman debate in the 1760s, between followers of Winckelmann who thought Greek culture and architecture superior to their Roman counterparts, and those who (like Piranesi) believed that the Romans had improved upon their Greek models.&lt;ref&gt;Gontar, Cybele, [https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/neoc_1/hd_neoc_1.htm Neoclassicism], The Heilbrunn Timeline of art History, metmuseum.org. Retrieved 2018-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt; His free relationship to the past may be summarized in a phrase of his that become a mantra: "col sporcar si trova"; "by messing about, one discovers".&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt; Vol. 1 No. 1, p. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout his lifetime, Piranesi created numerous prints depicting the Eternal City; these were widely collected by gentlemen on the Grand Tour. The Lobkowicz Collections, housed at the [[Lobkowicz Palace]], contains a group of twenty-six 18th-century engravings of views of modern and ancient Rome created by Giovanni Battista Piranesi.

==The ''Prisons'' (''Carceri'')==
The ''Prisons''  (''Carceri d'invenzione'' or 'Imaginary Prisons'), is a series of 16 prints produced in first and second states that show enormous subterranean vaults with stairs and mighty machines.

These images influenced [[Romanticism]] and [[Surrealism]]. While the ''[[veduta|Vedutisti]]'' (or "view makers") such as [[Canaletto]] and [[Bernardo Bellotto|Bellotto]], more often reveled in the beauty of the sunlit place, in Piranesi this vision takes on what from a modern perspective could be called a [[Kafkaesque]] distortion, seemingly erecting fantastic labyrinthine structures, epic in volume. They are ''[[Capriccio (art)|capricci]]'', whimsical aggregates of monumental architecture and ruin.

The series was started in 1745. The first state prints were published in 1750 and consisted of 14 etchings, untitled and unnumbered, with a sketch-like look. The original prints were 16" x 21". For the second publishing in 1761, all the etchings were reworked and numbered IâXVI (1â16). Numbers II and V were new etchings to the series. Numbers I to IX were all done in [[portrait format]] (vertical), while X to XVI were [[landscape format]] (horizontal+). Though untitled, their conventional titles are:

* I â Title Plate
* II â The Man on the Rack
* III â The Round Tower
* IV â The Grand Piazza
* V â The Lion Bas-Reliefs
* VI â The Smoking Fire
* VII â The Drawbridge
* VIII â The Staircase with Trophies
* IX â The Giant Wheel
* X â Prisoners on a Projecting Platform
* XI â The Arch with a Shell Ornament
* XII â The Sawhorse
* XIII â The Well
* XIV â The Gothic Arch
* XV â The Pier with a Lamp
* XVI â The Pier with Chains

[[Thomas De Quincey]] in ''[[Confessions of an English Opium-Eater]]'' (1820) wrote the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Many years ago, when I was looking over Piranesi's ''Antiquities of Rome'', [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Mr. Coleridge]], who was standing by, described to me a set of plates by that artist ... which record the scenery of his own visions during the delirium of a fever: some of them (I describe only from memory of Mr. Coleridge's account) representing vast [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] halls, on the floor of which stood all sorts of engines and machinery, wheels, cables, pulleys, levers, catapults, etc., etc., expressive of enormous power put forth, and resistance overcome. Creeping along the sides of the walls, you perceived a staircase; and upon it, groping his way upwards, was Piranesi himself: follow the stairs a little further, and you perceive it come to a sudden abrupt termination, without any balustrade, and allowing no step onwards to him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the second publishing, some of the illustrations appear to have been edited to contain (likely deliberate) [[Impossible object|impossible geometries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Piranesi's Carceri as Inconsistent"|publisher=The University of Adelaide -- Inconsistent Images|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/inconsistent-images/piranesi/|date=November 2007|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An in-depth analysis of Piranesi's ''Carceri'' was written by [[Marguerite Yourcenar]] in her ''[[Dark Brain of Piranesi: and Other Essays]]'' (1984). Further discussion of Piranesi and the ''Carceri'' can be found in ''The Mind and Art of Giovanni Battista Piranesi'' by John Wilton-Ely (1978). The style of Piranesi was imitated by twentieth-century forger [[Eric Hebborn]].

==Archaeologist==

It is important to look at his contribution as an archaeologist, which was acknowledged at the time as he had been elected to the London Society of Antiquaries. His influence of technical drawings in antiquarian publications is often overshadowed. He left explanatory notes in the lower margin about the structure and ornament. Most ancient monuments in Rome were abandoned in fields and gardens. Piranesi tried to preserve them with his engravings. To do this, Piranesi pushed himself to achieve realism in his work. A third of the monuments in Piranesi's engravings have disappeared, and the stucco and surfacings were often stolen, restored and modified clumsily. Piranesi's precise observational skills allow people to experience the  atmosphere in Rome in the eighteenth century. Piranesi may have recognised his role to disseminate remarkable information through meaningful images. He became the Director of the Portici Museum in 1751.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5559">'''Indigenous Futurisms''' is a movement consisting of art, literature, comics, games, and other forms of media which express Indigenous perspectives of the future, past, and present in the context of science fiction and related sub-genres. Such perspectives may reflect Indigenous ways of knowing, traditional stories, historical or contemporary politics or other cultural realities. 

Like [[Afrofuturism]], Indigenous futurism encapsulates multiple modes of art making from literature to visual arts, fashion and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=GuzmÃ¡n|first1=Alicia Inez|title=Indigenous Futurisms|url=https://ivc.lib.rochester.edu/indigenous-futurisms/|website=InVisible Culture: An Electronic Journal for Visual Culture|publisher=University of Rochester|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Grace Dillon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaertner|first1=David|title=âWHATâS A STORY LIKE YOU DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?â: CYBERSPACE AND INDIGENOUS FUTURISM|url=https://novelalliances.com/2015/03/23/whats-a-story-like-you-doing-in-a-place-like-this-cyberspace-and-indigenous-futurism-in-neal-stephensons-snow-crash/#_ftn1|website=Novel Alliances: Allied Perspectives on Literature, Art and New Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor in the Indigenous Nations Studies Program at Portland State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grace Dillon|url=https://www.pdx.edu/nas/grace-l-dillon-2|website=Portland State University|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous Futurisms critiques the historization of Indigenous people which is used to separate from them the contemporary world while challenging notions of what constitutes advanced technology &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thenewinquiry.com/the-space-ndns-star-map/|title=The Space NDNâs Star Map|last=Cornum|first=Lou Catherine|date=January 26, 2015|website=The New Inquiry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

There has been a long-standing '''influence of [[French language|French]] on [[English language|English]],''' in terms of [[syntax]], [[grammar]], [[lexicon]], spelling and pronunciation.

Most French vocabulary that entered English occurred after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 and the establishment of a French-speaking administration. French became the language of the court, the administration and the elites for several centuries, until after the [[Hundred Years War]]. English has been constantly influenced by French from that time till present day.
According to Laura K. Lawless, more than a third of the current [[English vocabulary]] is of French origin.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm |website=french.about.com |title=Terms of Enrichment: How French Has Influenced English |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216063051/http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm# |archive-date=2016-12-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to linguist [[Henriette Walter]], words of French origin represent more than two thirds of the English vocabulary. It is estimated by linguist Anthony Lacoudre that over 40 000 English words are directly French and may be understood without [[orthographical]] change by French speakers.&lt;ref name="dailymotion"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5vbb1z |title=L&amp;#039;incroyable histoire des mots franÃ§ais dans la langue anglaise â VidÃ©o dailymotion |website=dailymotion.com |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of French in England ==

=== Before 1066 ===
At the beginning of XIth century, the English language did not have a well-defined status. Indeed, the inhabitants of what would become [[Great Britain]] did not have a language that allowed them to communicate with each other. There were many different [[dialect]]al forms. Great Britain, in which various [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] idioms had coexisted since the IVth century, had experienced partial [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation]] since the 1st century A.D., and this for four centuries.

From 450 onwards, the [[Saxons]], the [[Angles (people)|Angles]] and the [[Jutes]], who came from the continent, settled in the south and east. Germanic dialects would prevail in these regions, supplanting Celtic dialects, which would remain in the west and north of the island ([[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], [[Scotland]]) and [[Ireland]]. In the VIIIth century, [[Vikings]] from [[Scandinavia]] settled on the island. Their languages, also Germanic, in turn influence the languages already present on the island. Thus, at the dawn of XIth century, the country was made up of a series of peoples with significantly different speeches, most of them Germanic, with multiple influences.

=== Norman conquest of England and its consequences ===
It is therefore a linguistically disunited people that the Normans will get massively in contact with, from 1066. [[William II of Normandy]], supported by his King, [[Philip I of France]], and his blood legitimacy to the throne of England, landed at [[Hastings]], in [[Sussex]], on 29 September 1066. His men are deployed around the city waiting for the king [[Harold II]]'s troops. On October 14, exhausted by the long journey to Hastings, Harold II's troops lost the battle after a day. Following the defeat of the English, Duke William II of Normandy became King of England on December 25, 1066, crowned under the name of William I of England, also known as William the Conqueror. This date marks the beginning of a long period of ties between the peoples and languages.

In fact, these links already existed before the Battle of Hastings. Indeed, the geographical location of Normandy, facing the English Channel, favoured commercial contacts with England. These ties will be further strengthened at the beginning of the XIth century when the daughter of the Duke [[Richard II of Normandy]], Emma, marries King [[Ãthelred II of England]]. But it is really from the 1066 conquest that [[proto-English]] becomes massively impregnated with [[Old French]], then modern French. It should be noted, however, that only French will influence English in the centuries following the conquest. The reverse contribution of English to French will only be real from the XVIIIth century.

The arrival of William the Conqueror and his barons significantly changed the linguistic situation in England. [[Norman language|Norman]] is essentially imposed in the upper layers of society. The Anglo-Saxon dialects were supplanted by Norman in the circles of the court and aristocracy, justice and the Church. The influential circles, who came from Normandy and settled in England, kept their Norman mother tongue, while the more modest rural and urban strata continued to speak English.

Norman is a particular variety of the [[Gallo-Roman]] language, spoken in Normandy. It is one of the [[Oil languages]] alongside, among others, the [[Picard language|Picard]] and the [[Walloon language|Walloon]]. The Norman language is modified in contact with the [[Anglo-Saxon]] language. It then integrates words and phrases from English and will give birth to a dialect, [[Anglo-Norman (language)|Anglo-Norman]], still spoken on the [[Anglo-Norman isles]]. Anglo-Norman can be described as a [[vernacular language]], on English soil in the XIth century, in the field of literature, culture, court and among the clergy. French was therefore, at first, spoken in England under the form of this Anglo-Norman dialect.

During the XIIth century, continental French has a greater influence on Old English. It acquires great prestige in England, especially within the aristocracy and the clergy. It becomes the language of law and justice nationwide. Rich and noble families, most of them of Norman origin, teach their children French or send them to study in France. The expansion of the French language in England was also encouraged by royal marriages. From [[Henry II Plantagenet]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] at the beginning of the century, to [[Henri VI]] and [[Marguerite of Anjou|Marguerite]] in the XVth century, all kings of England married French princesses. These marriages made French the language of the English court for several centuries and were decisive in strengthening the use of French in England. This period (XIIth-XVth centuries) is characterized by a massive influx of French words into Old English vocabulary.&lt;ref name="le-mot-juste-en-anglais"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html |title=Comment le franÃ§ais a influencÃ© la langue anglaise |website=Le mot juste en anglais |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120221242/https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html# |archive-date=2018-11-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1204, [[Philippe Auguste]] Normandy is officially annexed to the kingdom of France, politically isolating England from the continent. Normans who choose to stay in England move further away from France and, therefore, from the French language. Keeping its status as the language of justice and the language of power, England saw the first teaching manuals for teaching French to the English. These manuals were intended for English nobles who wish to perfect their knowledge of French and teach it to their children. Two types of French spoken in the higher spheres of English society can be distinguished during the XIIIth century : the Anglo-Norman dialect, which was the aristocrats' mother tongue, and a more prestigious type of French as a second language. Knowing "parisian" French was a mark of social distinction. As a language of culture, French supplanted Latin from the XIIth century onward as the language of diplomacy and worldly relations throughout Europe. The mass and influence of French literature reinforced its reputation and appeal.

=== The developing use of French ===
The [[XVIth century]], that of the [[Renaissance]], is a decisive century for French since king [[FranÃ§ois I of France]], through the [[Ordonnance de Villers-CotterÃªts]] ([[1539]]), makes French the official language of administration in the whole kingdom.
Although troubled by the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Italian Wars]], the language is marked by intellectual, technical and scientific effervescence. It ushered in an era of prosperity that would also spread to England through French.

The XVIIth century announces the apogee of the Kingdom of France. This period was characterized by the political, literary and artistic prestige of France and the French language. Peace restored and unity ensured in the country, economy grew considerably. Personalities such as the King [[Henri IV of France|Henri IV]], the [[Cardinal of Richelieu]] or the [[Sun King]] contribute to fixing and enhancing the French language in Europe, the Americas, India and Oceania.

The creation of the [[AcadÃ©mie franÃ§aise]] by Richelieu in 1635, under [[Louis XIII]], was a step that led to the standardization of French in continental Europe and abroad, including England. French is then the second language of all the elites in Europe, from Turkey to Ireland and from Moscow to Lisbon. The greatest scholars and intellectuals, writers and scientists, express themselves and correspond in this new standardised French. French is considered a perfect language, whose beauty and elegance are determined by the development of scientific logic, aided by dictionaries and grammars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/caief_0571-5865_1992_num_44_1_1775|title=Le FranÃ§ais face Ã  l'anglais : aspects linguistiques|first=Michael D.|last=Picone|date=22 November 1992|publisher=|journal=Cahiers de l'Association internationale des Ã©tudes francaises|volume=44|issue=1|pages=9â23|doi=10.3406/caief.1992.1775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the XXIst Century ==
The geographical use of French has continuously and greatly diversified in the last five hundred years, with countries and states like [[New-Brunswick]], [[Quebec]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Benin]], [[Togo]], [[Guinea]], [[Cameroon]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Tchad]], [[Djibouti]], [[Senegal]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Lebanon]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[French Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Vanuatu]] adopting it as their official language. This geographical diversity has led to many different contacts with [[vernacular]] dialects, regional and international languages, from which French has often been enriched locally.
In a number of countries and regions where French shares co-officiality with English (Cameroon, [[Canada]], [[Jersey]], [[Mauritius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311113430/http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rwanda]], Vanuatu), particular lexical regionalisms are observed where French and English terms are used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr/articles.php?pg=850|title=Avenir de la Langue FranÃ§aise (ALF) - Ile Maurice|first=|last=MAR|website=www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contribution of the French lexicon to English ==
Several elements must be observed.

* Sometimes, the English words' form has kept traces of Old French, written or oral, such as certain consonants (''forest'' / forest) or certain vowels or diphthongs (''veil'' / voil; ''leisure'' / leisure), the current French sometimes deviating more from its old form than the English (i.e. Old French ''ante'' gives "tante" in modern French and is written 'aunt' in modern English).
* Many English nouns, verbs and adjectives borrowed from Old French have not always kept the meaning they had in Old French. Sometimes, they have developed a different meaning from French. In both cases, these words are [[false friend]]s (''egre'' giving 'sour' (''aigre'') in French while mutating into 'eager' in English).
* Other English words are composed of both words of French and Germanic origins (''handkerchief'': ''hand'' is from the proto-Germanic ''k'''hand'''uz'' and ''kerchief'' is a mutation on the old French ''core chief'')
* Some forms of Old French did not survive in modern French, while they still exist in English (''soulace'',''conceler'',''estriver'',''gone'').
* It is not uncommon either for an English concept to have two or even three vocabulary words to describe it, one of French origin, a part from proto-Germanic and another of Latin origin (''royal'', ''kingly'', and ''regal'' all mean the same thing, 'royal').
* Most of the English words ending in ''-ous'', ''-ty'' (on the model of ''-tÃ©''),''-tion'', ''-ture'', ''-ture'', ''-ent'' are of French origin.
* Uses in social and intellectual life, but also certain domestic and food uses, demonstrate the omnipresence of French in English society in many fields, for example the names of meat: "beef" comes from the French ''buef'' (beef), "mutton" from ''moton'' (sheep), "pork" from ''pork'', "veal" from ''vel'' (calf).
* Some words borrowed in the XIXth and XXth centuries are still considered foreign words, French words (such as ''chic''). They are generally used by educated English people or by the press and other media and are seen as part of a distinguished language.
* Some [[Anglicisms]] are actually words that were borrowed from French a long time ago and have recently been borrowed back from English (such as ''bacon'').

The following French glossary in English is in no way exhaustive. These words come as examples to illustrate the countless French words that are part of the English language.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In this section, examples of French-to-English lexical contributions are classified by field and in chronological order. The periods during which these words were used in the English language are specified as much as possible. It is not always possible to state with certainty the precise period from which a word was borrowed or integrated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19315">The '''Jewish skeleton collection''' was an attempt by the Nazis to create an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] display to showcase the alleged racial inferiority of the "[[Jews|Jewish]] race" and to emphasize the Jews' status as ''[[Untermensch]]en'' ("sub-humans"), in contrast to the [[Germans|German]] race, which the Nazis considered to be [[Aryan]] ''[[Ãbermensch]]en''. The collection was to be housed at the Anatomy Institute at the [[ReichsuniversitÃ¤t StraÃburg|Reich University of Strasbourg]] in the annexed region of [[Alsace]], where the initial preparation of the corpses was performed.

The collection was sanctioned by  ReichsfÃ¼hrer of the SS [[Heinrich Himmler]], and designed by and under the direction of [[August Hirt]] with [[Rudolf Brandt]] and [[Wolfram Sievers]], general manager of the [[Ahnenerbe]], being responsible for procuring and preparing the corpses.

Work by [[Hans-Joachim Lang]] published in 2004 revealed the identities and family history of all the victims of this project, based on discovery of the prisoner numbers found at Natzweiler-Struthof in records of those vaccinated against typhus at Auschwitz. The list of names has been placed on a memorial at the cemetery where all were buried, at the facility used to murder them, and at the Anatomical Institute where the corpses were found in 1944.

==Selection==

The project was designed by August Hirt, who directed the phases that were performed before the end of the war ceased the project prior to its completion. Originally the "specimens" to be used in the collection were to be Jewish [[Commissar|commisars]] in the [[Red Army]] captured on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]] by the [[Wehrmacht]]. The 86 individuals ultimately chosen for the collection were obtained from among a pool of 115 Jewish inmates at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939â1945)|Occupied Poland]]. They were chosen for their perceived [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] racial characteristics. The initial selections and preparations were carried out by SS-HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer Dr. [[Bruno Beger]] and Dr. [[Hans Fleischhacker]], who arrived in Auschwitz in the first half of 1943 and finished the preliminary work by June 15, 1943. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Due to a [[typhus]] [[epidemic]] at Auschwitz, the candidates chosen for the skeleton collection were [[quarantine]]d in order to prevent them from becoming ill and ruining their value as anatomical specimens. In that time, the physical measurements were taken from the selected group of people. An excerpt from a letter written by Sievers in June 1943 reports on the preparation and the typhus epidemic: "Altogether 115 persons were worked on, 79 were Jews, 30 were Jewesses, 2 were Poles, and 4 were Asiatics. At the present time these prisoners are segregated by sex and are under [[quarantine]] in the two hospital buildings of Auschwitz."
In February 1942, Sievers submitted to Himmler, through Rudolf Brandt, a report from which the following is an extract read at the Nuremberg Doctors Trial by  General [[Telford Taylor]], Chief Counsel for the prosecution at Nuremberg:
[[File:Wolfram Sievers.jpg|thumb|[[Wolfram Sievers]]]]

{{quote|We have a nearly complete collection of skulls of all races and peoples at our disposal. Only very few specimens of skulls of the Jewish race, however, are available with the result that it is impossible to arrive at precise conclusions from examining them. The [[Eastern Front (World War II)|war in the East]] now presents us with the opportunity to overcome this deficiency. By procuring the skulls of the Jewish-[[Bolshevik]] [[Commissar]]s, who represent the prototype of the repulsive, but characteristic subhuman, we have the chance now to obtain a palpable, scientific document.

The best, practical method for obtaining and collecting this skull material could be handled by directing the Wehrmacht to turn over alive all captured Jewish-Bolshevik Commissars to the [[Feldgendarmerie|Field Police]]. They in turn are to be given special directives to inform a certain office at regular intervals of the number and place of detention of these captured Jews and to give them special close attention and care until a special delegate arrives. This special delegate, who will be in charge of securing the "material" has the job of taking a series of previously established photographs, anthropological measurements, and in addition has to determine, as far as possible, the background, date of birth, and other personal data of the prisoner. Following the subsequently induced death of the Jew, whose head should not be damaged, the delegate will separate the head from the body and will forward it to its proper point of destination in a [[Hermetic seal|hermetically]] sealed tin can especially produced for this purpose and filled with a conserving fluid.

Having arrived at the laboratory, the comparison tests and anatomical research on the skull, as well as determination of the race membership of pathological features of the skull form, the form and size of the brain, etc., can proceed. The basis of these studies will be the photos, measurements, and other data supplied on the head, and finally the tests of the skull itself.}}

==Preparation==

[[Image:BU 003749.jpeg|thumb|[[Josef Kramer]], photographed in [[leg irons]] at [[Belsen concentration camp]] before being removed to the POW cage at [[Celle]], 17 April 1945.]]

Ultimately, 87 of the inmates were shipped to [[Natzweiler-Struthof]]. These people were kept for about two weeks in Block 13 of the camp so that they might eat well to improve their appearance for the desired casts of their corpses. The deaths of 86 of these inmates were, in the words of Hirt, "induced" in an improvised [[Gas chamber|gassing facility]] at [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], and their corpses were sent to Strasbourg â 57 men and 29 women. The gassing occurred on August 11, 13, 17, and 19th, conducted by commandant [[Josef Kramer]], who directed the victims to undress, placed the poison in the ventilation, and watched the people fall to their deaths. One victim was shot for fighting to avoid being gassed and thus was not part of the collection.&lt;ref name=Bernas&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rfi.fr/hebdo/20141024-au-nom-de-la-race-et-de-la-science-documentaire-crime-nazi-meconnu-prime-waterloo/ |title=Un documentaire sur un crime nazi mÃ©connu primÃ© Ã  Waterloo |trans-title=A documentary about a misunderstood Nazi crime winning at Waterloo |date=October 24, 2014 |accessdate=March 8, 2016 |author=Bernas, Anne |language=French |publisher=RFI les voix du monde}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josef Kramer, acting commandant of Natzweiler-Struthof (who became the commandant at Auschwitz and the last commandant of [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen Belsen]]), personally carried out the gassing of the victims, per his testimony at his post-war trial. It is believed that three men died in transport from Auschwitz to Natzweiler-Struthof.&lt;ref name=Lang&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.die-namen-der-nummern.de/index.php/en/scientific-murders |title=Scientific Murders, Anthroplogists at Auschwitz |author=Lang, Hans-Joachim |work=The Names of the Numbers, In Memoriam of 86 Jewish People who Fell Victim to the Nazi Scientists |accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next part of the process for this "collection" was to make anatomical casts of the bodies prior to reducing them to skeletons. With the approach of the Allies in 1944, there was concern over the possibility that the corpses could be discovered, as they had still not been [[excarnation|defleshed]]. In September 1944, Sievers telegrammed Brandt: "The collection can be defleshed and rendered unrecognizable. This, however, would mean that the whole work had been done for nothing-at least in part-and that this singular collection would be lost to science, since it would be impossible to make plaster casts afterwards."

He was chosen to be an anatomical specimen, shipped to [[Natzweiler-Struthof]] and executed in the gas chamber in August 1943]]

Some work had been done at the Anatomical Institute, but the project was never completed. The body casts were not made, and the corpses were not defleshed as skeletons. When the Allies arrived, they found the corpses, some complete and some beheaded, preserved by formalin.&lt;ref name="Bazelon" /&gt;

==Aftermath==


Brandt and Sievers were indicted, tried, and convicted in the [[Doctors' Trial]] in [[Nuremberg]], and both were hanged in [[Landsberg Prison]] on June 2, 1948. Josef Kramer was convicted of war crimes and hanged in {{ill|Hamelin prison|de|GefÃ¤ngnis Hameln}} by British executioner [[Albert Pierrepoint]] on December 13, 1945. August Hirt, who conceived the project, was sentenced to death in absentia at the Military War Crimes Trial at Metz on 23 December 1953.&lt;ref name=LangZeit /&gt; It was unknown at the time that Hirt had shot himself in the head on June 2, 1945 near the town of [[Schluchsee, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg|Schluchsee]], while hiding in the [[Black Forest]].&lt;ref name=LangZeit&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Hans-Joachim |title=Skelette fÃ¼r StraÃburg Eines der grausigsten Wissenschaftsverbrechen des "Dritten Reiches" ist endlich aufgeklÃ¤rt |trans-title=Skeletons for Strasbourg: One of the most gruesome crimes of science in the "Third Reich" is finally cleared |url=http://www.zeit.de/2004/35/A-Strassburg|website=Die Zeit|accessdate=April 3, 2016|language=German|date=19 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Bruno Beger was convicted by a West German court as an accessory to 86 murders for his role in procuring the victims of the Jewish skeleton collection.

In 2003, Dr. [[Hans-Joachim Lang]], a German professor at the [[University of TÃ¼bingen]], succeeded in identifying all the victims by comparing a list of inmate numbers of the 86 corpses at the Reichs University in Strasbourg, surreptitiously recorded by Hirt's French assistant Henri Henrypierre, with a list of numbers of inmates vaccinated at Auschwitz. The names and biographical information of the victims were published in the book ''Die Namen der Nummern'' (''The Names of the Numbers'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Die Namen der Nummern:  Wie es gelang, die 86 Opfer eines NS-Verbrechens zu identifizieren |trans-title=The names of the numbers: How it was possible to identify the 86 victims of a Nazi crime |edition=hardback |author=Hans-Joachim Lang |publisher=Hoffmann + Campe Vlg GmbH |date=August 31, 2004 |isbn=3-455-09464-3 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel Gordon and Joachim Zepelin translated the Introduction to the book into English at the web site where the whole book is posted in German, including the biographies of the 86 people.&lt;ref name=LangEng&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.die-namen-der-nummern.de/html/the_names.html |title=Die Namen Der Nummern |year=2007 |author=Rachel Gordon, translator |author2=Joachim Zepelin, translator |location=Berlin |accessdate=8 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208080253/http://die-namen-der-nummern.de/html/the_names.html |archivedate=February 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lang recounts in detail the story of how he determined the identities of the 86 victims gassed for Dr. August Hirt's project of the Jewish skeleton collection.

In 1951, the remains of the 86 victims were re-interred in one location in the Cronenbourg-Strasbourg Jewish Cemetery. On December 11, 2005, memorial stones engraved with the names of the 86 victims were placed at the cemetery. One is at the site of the mass grave, the other along the wall of the cemetery.

{{Chinese folk religion}}
[[File:Flickr - archer10 (Dennis) - China-8117.jpg|thumb|150px|Woman kindling the incense sticks for ''jingxiang'' at a temple in [[China]].]]
'''JÃ¬ngxiÄng''' (æ¬é¦ "offering incense with respect"), '''shÃ ngxiÄng''' (ä¸é¦ "offering incense"), '''bÃ ishÃ©n''' (æç¥ "worshipping gods"), is a ritual of offering [[joss stick|incense]] accompanied by tea and or fruits in [[Chinese traditional religion]]. In [[Chinese ancestral religion|ancestral religious worship]] it's ''jÃ¬ngzÇ'' (æ¬ç¥ "veneration of the ancestor") or ''bÃ izÇ'' æç¥ ("worship of the ancestor"). It is observed by a devotee holding joss incense with both hands in front of an altar while praying or meditating.  For added respect the devotee or descendent is expected to kneel during and after placing the incense in the urn or at the altar.

Jiangxiang is practiced in diffused Chinese folk religion and also by adherents belonging to the schools of [[Taoism]], [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]]. It's used for making a general prayer to one of the [[Chinese deities]], sending well wishes to a deceased ancestor as part of daily prayers in Chinese [[ancestor veneration]], or celebrating the [[Qingming Festival]], [[Ghost festival]] and [[Chongyang Festival]] .

==Number and meanings of incense==
The number of joss stick varies, usually three or five, or less commonly, nine. 
The ancient Chinese consider that even numbers are associated with ''[[yin and yang|yin]]'', and odd numbers are associated with ''[[yin and yang|yang]]''. Because ''yang'' represents positive and auspicious things, odd numbers like three, five and nine are preferred in many rituals.

==Sandalwood joss==
The scent of the joss sticks is believed to calm the human spirit.  The same effect is believed to affect the spirit of a deceased ancestor.  In this connection it also serves as a notice to the deity an adherent is respecting. It is also considered a form of food to the spirits and gods in [[Daoism]] and [[Chinese Buddhism]].

==Other offerings==
Usually jingxiang is done with an offering of tea, in a number corresponding to the gods, typically three cups.  Fruit is generally offered to accompany Jingxiang, again the specification differs for temples or deities.

'''John Barnes Linnett''' ({{circa|1831}} â ) was a British [[lithograph]] [[printer (publisher)|printer]] based in [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. Although the French [[Pierre-Hubert Desvignes]] is generally credited with being the inventor of the [[flip book]], Linnett was the first to [[patent]] the invention, in 1868, under the name of ''kineograph''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McDonough |first1=John |last2=Egolf |first2=Karen |title=The Advertising Age Encyclopedia of Advertising |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781135949068 |page=81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZLtCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=John+Barnes+Linnett |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chronological Index of Patents Applied for and Patents Granted |date=1869 |publisher=G.E.

He was born in [[Austrey]], Warwickshire.&lt;ref&gt;''1851 England Census''&lt;/ref&gt;

Linnett died of [[pneumonia]]. His wife sold the patent to an American.

'''Juju''' or '''ju-ju''' ({{lang-fr|joujou|lit=plaything}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/juju |title=Juju &amp;#124; Define Juju at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|juju}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a spiritual belief system incorporating objects, such as amulets, and spells used in religious practice, as part of [[witchcraft]] in [[West Africa]]. The term has been applied to [[traditional African religions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mockler-Ferryman|first=Augustus|authorlink=Augustus Mockler-Ferryman|title=Imperial Africa: The Rise, Progress and Future of the British Possessions in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PMohAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA392|year=1898|publisher=Imperial Press, limited|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "juju" and the practices associated with it, travelled to the [[Americas]] from West Africa with the influx of slaves via the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and still survives in some areas, particularly among the various groups of [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]], who have preserved their African traditions.

==Overview==
Juju is sometimes used to enforce a contract or ensure compliance. In a typical scenario, The witch doctor casting the spell requires a payment for this service.&lt;ref name=alj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2011/08/201189141348631784.html|title=People &amp; Power - The Nigerian Connection|work=Al Jazeera|date=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to common belief, [[West African Vodun|Vodun]] is not related to juju, despite the linguistic and spiritual similarities. Juju has acquired some karmic attributes in more recent times: good juju can stem from almost any good deed; bad juju can be spread just as easily. These ideas revolve around the luck and fortune portions of juju. The use of juju to describe an object usually involves small items worn or carried; these generally contain medicines produced by witch doctors.

The term "juju" also is used to refer to the juju bean native to West Africa. The poisonous bean grows on wild tree-dwelling vines. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The term "juju" is commonly used to refer to the feeling of something. For example, if a person feels offset by an object or place, they would say that the object or place has "bad juju.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}"

'''''Memory of Water''''' (Finnish: '''''Teemestarin kirja''''', "The Tea Master's Book") is the [[debut novel]] by Finnish author [[Emmi ItÃ¤ranta]], published in 2014 by [[HarperCollins]]. The Finnish version of the novel, which ItÃ¤ranta wrote simultaneously along with the English one,&lt;ref name="lotta"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buxton|first1=Charlotta|title=How to write a novel in two languages â a writing interview with Emmi ItÃ¤ranta|url=http://www.londonlotta.com/2013/05/how-to-write-a-novel-in-two-languages-a-writing-interview-with-emmi-itaranta/|website=Londonlotta|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in Finland in 2013 by the publishing house [[:fi:Teos (kirjankustantamo)|Teos]]. Set in a [[dystopian]] future where fresh water is scarce, it tells the story of Noria, a young tea master's apprentice, who must come to terms with a great secret and even greater responsibility that follows this knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farmar |first1=Katherine |title=Memory of Water by Emmi ItÃ¤ranta |url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2014/08/memory_of_water.shtml |website=Strange Horizons |accessdate=26 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305132249/http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2014/08/memory_of_water.shtml |archivedate=5 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6782">A '''Monolingual learner's dictionary''' (or '''MLD''') is a type of [[dictionary]] designed to meet the reference needs of people learning a [[foreign language]]. MLDs are based on the premise that language-learners should progress from a [[bilingual dictionary]] to a monolingual one as they become more proficient in their [[Second language|target language]], but that general-purpose dictionaries (aimed at [[native speaker]]s) are inappropriate for their needs.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Dictionaries for learners include information on [[grammar]], [[word usage|usage]], common errors, [[collocation]], and [[pragmatics]], which is largely missing from standard dictionaries, because native speakers tend to know these aspects of language intuitively.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} And while the [[definition]]s in standard dictionaries are often written in difficult language, those in a monolingual learnerâs dictionary aim to be simple and accessible.

==History of English language MLDs==

The first English MLD, published in 1935, was the ''New Method English Dictionary'' by [[Michael Philip West|Michael West]] and James Endicott, a small dictionary using a restricted [[defining vocabulary]] of just 1490 words. Since the end of World War Two, global sales of the MLD have run into the tens of millions, reflecting the boom in the [[English language learning and teaching|English language teaching]] industry.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Probably the best-known English monolingual dictionary for [[Advanced learner's dictionary|advanced learners]] is the ''[[Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary]]'', now in its ninth edition. It was originally published in Japan in 1942 as ''The Idiomatic and Syntactic Dictionary of English'', written by [[A. S. Hornby]] and two collaborators. It was subsequently republished as ''A Learner's Dictionary of Current English'' in 1948, before acquiring its current name.

Other publishers gradually entered the market. The ''[[Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English]]'' was published in 1978, and its most striking feature was the use of a restricted defining vocabulary, which is now a standard feature of learners' dictionaries. There are currently six major MLDs for advanced learners. In addition to the Oxford and Longman dictionaries, these are:
*''[[COBUILD|Collins Cobuild]] English Dictionary'', first published in 1987
*''[[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge]] International Dictionary of English'', 1995, now published as the ''Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary''
*''[[Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners]]'', 2002
*''[[Merriam-Webster]]'s Advanced Learner's English Dictionary'', 2008
All of these dictionaries are available in hard copy and online.

Since the 1980s, the English MLD has, arguably, been the most innovative area in the field of lexicography, in terms of both the way dictionaries are written and the aspects of language which dictionaries describe, {{citation needed|date=December 2013}} in particular the use of software in combination with [[text corpus|text corpora]] to:
*generate language description - a radical innovation which was introduced by the [[COBUILD]] project in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, J.M. (Ed.), ''Looking Up: an account of the COBUILD project'', Collins, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
*automate the dictionary-making process&lt;ref&gt;Rundell, M. and Kilgarriff, A., 'Automating the creation of dictionaries: where will it all end?', in Meunier F., De Cock S., Gilquin G. and Paquot M. (Eds), ''A Taste for Corpora. A tribute to Professor [[Sylviane Granger]]''. Benjamins, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
*identify [[collocations]]&lt;ref&gt;Kilgarriff, A. &amp; Rundell, M.  Lexical profiling software and its lexicographic applications â a case study. In Braasch and Povlsen (Eds.) ''Proceedings of the Tenth Euralex Congress'', University of Copenhagen, Denmark. 2004, 807â818.&lt;/ref&gt;

MLDs were among the first dictionaries to appear on CD-ROM, with the ''Longman Interactive English Dictionary'' leading the way in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Nesi, H., 'Dictionaries in electronic form', in Cowie, A.P. (Ed.), ''The Oxford History of English Lexicography'', Oxford University Press 2009: 458â478&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the six MLDs listed above have become available in [[Monolingual learner's dictionary#External links|free online versions]].

MLDs have been the subject of research into how people use dictionaries,&lt;ref&gt;Lew, R., Introduction to Special Issue on Dictionary Use, ''International Journal of Lexicography'', 24/1, 2011: 1â4&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the subject of scholarly work.&lt;ref&gt;Rundell, M., 'Recent trends in English pedagogical lexicography', ''International Journal of Lexicography'', 11/4, 1998: 315â342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bejoint, H., ''The Lexicography of English''. Oxford University Press, 2010: 163â200&lt;/ref&gt; A standard book on the subject is Cowie 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Cowie, A.P., ''English Dictionaries for Foreign Learners'', Oxford University Press 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online dictionaries==
The Internet offers a range of online dictionary resources. Some, like the [[Open Dictionary of English]], are explicitly designed as learner's dictionaries, and may even include built-in, adaptive tutoring.

Others, like [[Wordnik]] or [[Wiktionary]], don't have that explicit focus, yet provide useful resources to learners due to their collaborative nature, which tends to produce definitions and sample sentences that are more diverse, and written in popular terms.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The '''National Museum of Ethiopia''' ('''NME'''), also referred to as the '''Ethiopian National Museum''', is a [[national museum]] in [[Ethiopia]]. It is located in the capital, [[Addis Ababa]], near the [[Addis Ababa University]]'s graduate school.

==Overview==
[[File:Selam.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Reconstitution of [[Selam (Australopithecus)|Selam]], a three-year-old ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' hominid, housed in the National Museum's basement gallery.]]
The [[museum]] houses Ethiopia's artistic treasures. It contains many precious local archaeological finds such as the fossilized remains of early [[hominid]]s, the most famous of which is "[[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]," the partial skeleton of a specimen of ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]''. Recently added to the basement gallery is a display on ''[[Selam (Australopithecus)|Selam]]'', found between 2000 and 2004. This archaic fossil is estimated to date to 3.3 million years ago.

In 1936, the concept of a museum was first introduced in Ethiopia when an exhibition was opened, displaying ceremonial costumes donated by the [[Solomonic dynasty]] and their close associates. The current NME grew from the establishment of the Institute of Archaeology, which was founded in 1958. The institute was founded to promote and facilitate the archaeological research mission in the northern part of Ethiopia by French archaeologists.
[[File:Ancient Figurine, National Museum, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2130296832).jpg|thumb|right|Stone statue from [[Dar'a|Addi-Galamo]], [[Tigray Region]] (dated 6th-5th century BCE), part of the National Museum's collection. The statue is inscribed with a phrase in [[Modern South Arabian languages|South Arabian]], ''"For God Grants a Child to Yamanat"''.]] 
The museum started its activities by exhibiting objects from these excavation missions. With the establishment of the Ethiopian Cultural Heritage Administration in 1976, the idea came up to open a National Museum, which was supported by the Government. The NME began to operate under the National Act which provides for the protection and preservation of antiquities, and has legislative authority governing all sites and monuments throughout the country of Ethiopia.
[[File:National Museum of Ethiopia Office facility.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Ethiopian National Museum administration building, constructed in Italian style.]]
Later, the National Museum diversified its activities and organised into three working department, i.e. the conservation department, the documentation department and the exhibition and research department. 

The NME at present has four main exhibition sections. The basement is dedicated to archaeological and paleoanthropological sections. This area show the previously mentioned hominids. The first floor contains objects from ancient and medieval periods, as well as regalia and memorabilia from former rulers, who include Emperor [[Haile Selassie]]. The second floor shows art work in a chronological order, from traditional to contemporary works. Afewerk Tekle's massive African Heritage is one of the most notable pieces. Another painting depicts the meeting of Solomon and Sheba.&lt;ref name="Photographs of the museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Photographs of the National Museum of Ethiopia|url=https://independent-travellers.com/ethiopia/addis_ababa/national_museum/|website=Independent Travellers|publisher=independent-travellers.com|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second floor contains a collection of secular arts and crafts, including traditional weapons, jewellery, utensils, clothing and musical instruments.&lt;ref name="Photographs of the museum"/&gt; Finally, the third floor has an ethnographic display. Here, the museum tries to give an overview of the cultural richness and variety of the peoples of [[Ethiopia]].

'''National Non-Fiction Day''' (NNFD) is annual celebration of children's [[non-fiction]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foyles.co.uk/news/national-nonfiction-day-to-be-celebrated-in-uk] Foyles: National Non-Fiction Day to be celebrated in UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/reading_the_game/news/1880_national_non-fiction_day_to_debut_on_4_november] National Literacy Trust: National Non-Fiction Day to debut on 4 November&lt;/ref&gt;

It was initiated by [[Federation of Children's Book Groups|The Federation of Children's Book Groups]] in partnership with Scholastic Childrenâs Books and is celebrated across the UK each year on the first Thursday in November (at approximately the same time as the announcement of the winners of the [[School Library Association]] Information Book Award&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sla.org.uk/information-book-award.php]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The day is used by libraries, schools, literacy organisations, book reviewers and parents to highlight the best information and narrative non-fiction books for children, and to show how itâs not just fiction that can be read and enjoyed for pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.achuka.co.uk/achockablog/archives/2011/10/national-non-fi.html] Achokablog: National Non-Fiction Day, This Thursday&lt;/ref&gt; Each year there is a different theme to the day.

[[Image:Alpine valley.jpg|thumb|right|Alpine valley, like Oldest Dryas]]
The '''Oldest Dryas''' was a climatic period, which occurred during the coldest [[stadial]] after the [[Weichselian]] glaciation in north Europe. In the [[Alps]], the Oldest Dryas corresponds to the [[Gschnitz]] stadial of the [[WÃ¼rm glaciation]]. The three âDryasâ periods (younger, older, oldest) are named for a marker species, ''[[Dryas octopetala]]'', detected in [[core sample]]s of glacial ice and [[peat bog]]s. The Oldest Dryas corresponds to [[pollen zone]] Ia.

==Dating==
[[Image:Greenland Kangerlussuaq icesheet.jpg|thumb|right|The edge of the ice in Greenland]]
The period was between 16,050-13,050 [[Before Christ|BC]], from Roberts, 1998. A date from [[Kilkeel]], [[Northern Ireland]], extends the start of the period to as early as 17,050 BC. A strong sequence of carbon-14 dates derived from layered material in the Hauterive/Rouges-Terres excavations on the northwest shore of [[Lake NeuchÃ¢tel]] in [[Switzerland]], 1992â1993, places the end of the Oldest Dryas at about 12,700 BC, calibrated. The same date from [[Antarctica]] and the south China sea is 14,600 and 14,700, respectively, and a [[Greenland]] ice core indicates 14,500. David Miles refers to the Oldest Dryas as the last [[Heinrich event]] (H1) and dates it to between 16,500 and 14,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David  |last=Miles  |title=The Tale of the Axe: How the Neolithic Revolution Transformed Britain |authorlink= |publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson|location = London, UK |year=2016 |page=79 |isbn=978-0-500-05186-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate standard to which all these dates are to be compared is the graph of the [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]s, which gives change in isotope concentration on the y-axis, with time on the x-axis. The graph plots many events that are sharply defined, but others are not. The selection of a terminal point is sometimes partially arbitrary.

The end of the Oldest Dryas is sharply defined. The beginning is a long, gently sloping band, probably no earlier than 17,050 BC, but the date might be set later by approximately 1000 years. Data derived from isotope variation of [[nitrogen]] and [[argon]] trapped in [[Greenland]] ice gives a high-resolution date for the end of the oldest Dryas at the sharp temperature rise of 14.67 ky BP.

[[Image:Lac de Neuchatel depuis la Neuchatel (ville suisse) dscn0660.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Neuchatel]]
The complete sequence of late [[Pleistocene]] climatic periods, defined for [[Northern Europe]], are the Oldest Dryas (stadial), the [[BÃ¸lling Oscillation|BÃ¶lling]] (interstadial), the [[Older Dryas]] (stadial), the [[AllerÃ¸d Oscillation|AllerÃ¸d]] (interstadial), and the [[Younger Dryas]] (stadial). The [[Holocene]] begins immediately afterward. The last three are also [[Blytt-Sernander]] periods.

Sometimes, the Older Dryas is missing, as in the [[Jura Mountains]] of [[France]], or it is negligible in the evidence. In that case, the initial part of the sequence appears to be Oldest Dryas (cold), BÃ¸lling-AllerÃ¸d (warm), Younger Dryas (cold). The BÃ¸lling-AllerÃ¸d corresponds to the [[Windermere]] interstadial in [[Great Britain|Britain]].

Often, however, the apparently-missing Older Dryas is a problem of resolution in the evidence. Some scientists have undertaken high-resolution studies, which combine a variety of climatological methods. They, like the ones conducted on [[Owens Lake|Owens]] and [[Mono Lake|Mono]] Lakes, in [[California]], usually detect the Older Dryas. Even when it is detected, it appears to be no more than a few centuries of slightly-cooler weather on the oxygen isotope ratio graph.

==Flora==
During the Oldest Dryas, Europe was treeless and similar to the Arctic [[tundra]], but much drier and grassier than the modern tundra. It contained shrubs and herbaceous plants such as the following:
:*[[Poaceae]], grasses
:*''[[Artemisia (plant)|Artemisia]]''
:*''[[Dwarf Birch|Betula nana]]'', dwarf birch
:*''[[Dwarf Willow|Salix retusa]]'', dwarf willow
:*''[[Dryas octopetala]]''
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Grasslands-menggu.jpg|Grassland ([[Inner Mongolia]])
Image:Artemisia_vulgaris_-_KÃ¶hlerâs_Medizinal-Pflanzen-016.jpg|''Artemisia vulgaris''
Image:Betula nana0.jpg|''Betula nana''
Image:Mountainavens2.jpg|''Dryas octopetala''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Fauna==
Species were mainly Arctic but during the Glacial Maximum, the warmer weather species had withdrawn into refugia and began to repopulate Europe in the Oldest Dryas.

The brown bear, ''[[Brown bear|Ursos arctos]]'', was among the first to arrive in the north. Genetic studies indicate North European brown bears came from a refugium in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] of [[Moldavia]]. Other refugia were in [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Greece]].

The bears would not have returned north except in pursuit of food. The tundra must already have been well populated. It is likely that the species hunted by humans at [[Lake NeuchÃ¢tel]] in [[Switzerland]] by the end of the period were present during it. Here are other animals present:

[[Aves]]
:*''[[Black-throated diver|Gavia arctica]]'', black-throated diver
:*''[[Black-necked grebe|Podiceps nigricollis]]'', black-necked grebe
:*''[[Whooper swan|Cygnus cygnus]]'', whooper swan
:*''[[Golden eagle|Aquila chrysaetos]]'', golden eagle
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Gavia arctica1.jpg|''Gavia arctica''
Image:Podiceps nigricollis naumann.jpg|''Podiceps nigricollis''
Image:Cygnus cygnus from zh.JPG|''Cygnus cygnus''
Image:Aquila chrysaetos large drawing.jpg|''Aquila chrysaetos''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The above birds are primarily maritime. They must have fed in the copious glacial waters of the north that were just beginning to be released.

[[Fish]]
:*''[[Burbot|Lota lota]]'', burbot
:*''[[Grayling (species)|Thymallus thymallus]]'', grayling
:*''[[Common Roach|Rutilus rutilus]]'', roach
:*''[[Trout|Salmo trutta]]'', trout
:*''[[Salvelinus]] alpinus'', char
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Tarfala.jpg|Glacial stream
Image:TrÃ¼sche Walchensee.jpg|''Lota lota''
Image:Bachforelle Zeichnung.jpg|''Salmo trutta''
Image:RÃ¶ding, Iduns kokbok.jpg|''Salvelinus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The smaller mammals of the food chain inhabited the herbaceous blanket of the tundra:

[[Cricetidae]]
:*''[[Lemming|Discrotonyx torquatus]]'', collared lemming
:*''[[Vole|Microtus oeconomus]]'', root vole
:*''[[Vole|Microtus arvalis]]'', common vole
:*''[[Vole|Chionmys nivalis]]'', snowy vole

[[Leporidae]]
:*''[[Mountain hare|Lepus timidus]]'', Arctic hare

[[Sciuridae]]
:*''[[Marmot|Marmota marmota]]'', marmot

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:TundraVole23.jpg|''Microtus oeconomus''
Image:Feldmaus Microtus arvalis.jpg|''Microtus arvalis''
Image:Arctic Hare.jpg|''Lepus timidus''
Image:Marmota marmota Alpes1.jpg|''Marmota marmota''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In addition to bears and birds were other predators of the following small animals:

[[Carnivora]]
:*''[[Lynx|Felis lynx]]'', lynx
:*''[[Arctic fox|Alopex lagopus]]'', Arctic fox
:*''[[Wolf|Canis lupus]]'', wolf

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Lynx lynx poing.jpg|Lynx (or Felis) lynx
Image:Alopex lagopus standing on Nizke Island.jpg|''Alopex lagopus''
Image:Canis lupus portrait.jpg|''Canis lupus''
Image:IcelandicHorseInWinter.jpg|Icelandic horse, perhaps like ''Equus ferus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Humans were interested in the large mammals, which included:
:*''[[Reindeer|Rangifer tarandus]]'', reindeer
:*''[[Horse|Equus ferus]]'', wild horse
:*''[[Ibex|Capra ibex]]'', ibex

At some point, the larger mammals arrived: [[hyena]], [[woolly rhinoceros]], [[cave bear]] and [[mammoth]].
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Albino raindeer.jpg|Rangifer tarandus
Image:CapraIbex-1.jpg|Capra ibex
Image:Wooly rhinoceros.jpg|Woolly rhinoceros
Image:Mammouth.png|Mammoth
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Human prehistory==
[[Image:JomonPottery.JPG|thumb|right|JÅmon pottery]]
Human cultures in Europe were Upper [[Palaeolithic]] and belonged to [[Cro-Magnon]] man. [[Neanderthal]]s had long since disappeared by replacement or amalgamation with ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. The [[Magdalenian]] culture of reindeer hunters prevailed in Western Europe. From the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] eastward, the Epigravettian continued the prior [[Gravettian]]. In Japan, the [[JÅmon]] culture had already become sedentary and was producing some food, and possibly grew rice, but it was not at all urban. It was manufacturing the first known pottery.

One of the most remarkable discoveries of the period was the domestic wolf, a distinct breed of ''[[Canis lupus]]'', with smaller teeth. The domestic dog, ''[[Canis familiaris]]'', also has been found. It is thought that the animals helped with the hunting, but they would, by the nature of the hunt, have gradually become adept at herding.

*'''''Operation Delta Force 3: Clear Target''''' (1999), [[direct-to-video]]
*'''''Operation Delta Force 4: Deep Fault''''' (1999), direct-to-video
*'''''[[Operation Delta Force 5: Random Fire]]''''' (2000), direct-to-video

===Film series===
All five films credit [[Danny Lerner]] as a writer and producer. [[David Sparling]] was involved in the writing of all but the final installment. [[Yossi Wein]] was the cinematographer for the first film, and he was the director of the second and fifth films.  The actors starring in the film were Ernie Hudson, Jeff Fahey, Frank Zagarino, Todd Jensen, Joe Lara and Hal Holbrook.

===Operation Delta Force 1===
Focusing on the activities of an elite group of [[US]] soldiers ([[Delta Force]]), the film titles apparently attempt to capitalize on the earlier [[Chuck Norris]] films ''[[The Delta Force (film)|The Delta Force]]'' and its sequels ''[[Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection]]'' and ''[[Delta Force 3: The Killing Game]]''.

===Operation Delta Force 2===
{{empty section|date=January 2017}}With global safety at stake, Delta Force - the world's most elite combat unit - is called to eliminate a dangerous international criminal who threatens to unleash nuclear terror unless he receives 25 billion dollars in exchange. This time, the adrenaline pumps twice as hard as the team turns up the heat with blistering action, thermonuclear suspense and pulse-pounding excitement!

The '''pounded rice ritual''' normally   occurs with an [[arranged marriage]] occurring in [[Southeast Asia]].  An arranged marriage is one where elders of the prospective families negotiate the union with varying levels of input and involvement from the bride and groom.  The wedding ceremony normally occurs at the home of the brideâs family.  The groom is carried on a chair along with his family to the brideâs home.  He then takes part in an all-night ceremony of worship while the other guests feast and celebrate.  The day following the ceremony, the newly married couple travels to the home of the groom.  During this journey the bride is carried by chair.  The entire wedding party stops along the journey for a rest and for a very important ritual surrounding pounded rice.

Pounded rice is a popular snack in [[Southeast Asia]].  This ritual â... symbolically constructs through language the hierarchical relationship between the new husband and wife.â&lt;ref&gt;Ahearn, 88- 95&lt;/ref&gt;  The bridal attendant places a plate of pounded rice on the lap of the wife.  The husband, coached by his male kin, asks his wife in a formal manner, âPlease bring the pounded rice, Wife; our wedding party has gotten hungry.â{{dubious|date=June 2013}}  The wife, veiled and sobbing, is physically moved by the bridal attendant to pour a portion of the pounded rice into the open [[handkerchief]] of the husband.  The husband then asks his wife again for some pounded rice, this time in an informal manner.  The wife then pours another portion of the pounded rice into the handkerchief of her husband.  He then asks her a third time for the pounded rice in the lowest linguistic form of their language.  The wife then dumps the remaining rice into the handkerchief and the groom then hands out the snack to the wedding party.  This ritual symbolizes the transition the bride has made from her marriage.  She will now be spoken to in this extremely informal speech.  The three attempts symbolize the groomâs transition into treating his wife lower than he.  This transition in linguistics symbolizes the hierarchy that will be faced in the marriage. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

A '''public data network''' is a [[telecommunications network|network]] established and operated by a [[telecommunications]] administration, or a recognized private operating agency, for the specific purpose of providing [[data transmission]] services for the public.

In communications, a PDN is a [[circuit switched|circuit-]] or [[packet-switched]] network that is available to the public and that can transmit data in digital form. A PDN provider is a company that provides access to a PDN and that provides any of [[X.25]], [[frame relay]], or [[cell relay]] ([[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]]) services. Access to a PDN generally includes a guaranteed bandwidth, known as the [[committed information rate]] (CIR). Costs for the access depend on the guaranteed rate. PDN providers differ in how they charge for temporary increases in required bandwidth (known as surges). Some use the amount of overrun; others use the surge duration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4208">'''Reading Specialist Certification''' is required to serve as a reading specialist in [[Elementary school|elementary]] and [[high school]]s.  Reading specialists are professionals who aim to improve reading achievement in their district or school by serving as [[teacher]]s, coaches, or leaders of school reading programs.&lt;ref name="reading.org"&gt;http://www.reading.org/General/CurrentResearch/Standards/ProfessionalStandards2010/ProfessionalStandards2010_Role5.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  The reading specialist is authorized to teach reading and to provide [[technical assistance]] and [[professional development]] to teachers.  The reading specialist also supports, supplements and extends classroom teaching, and works collaboratively to implement a quality reading program that is research-based and meets the needs of students.

== Individual state standards ==

Certification generally involves completing [[literacy]]-related [[coursework]] after one has obtained a [[bachelor's degree]].  Each state has different criteria for obtaining reading specialist certification.  Some states require general [[teacher certification]], and some require at least one year of teaching experience in a general [[classroom]], before obtaining reading specialist certification.   It may be issued as a full certificate or as an endorsement on an existing teaching certificate.   Some states require applicants to pass a reading specialist content area examination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isbe.state.il.us/certification/requirements/toc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Reading Association standards ==

The [[International Reading Association]] has its own standards for reading specialists, which they also term literacy coaches.  They posit that a reading specialist must have valid teaching certification, teaching experience, and a master's degree with concentration in reading and writing education.  The International Reading Association also believes that reading specialists should undergo coursework that builds skills and knowledge that would result in ability to take on [[leadership]] skills with the school reading program, fostering knowledge among staff and students.  In addition, the Association recommends that specialists seeking certification should complete 21â27 hours of [[language arts]], reading, and other related courses at the graduate level.  They state that the graduate-level coursework should include a [[practicum]] with a supervisor, recommended to be 6 semester hours.&lt;ref name="reading.org"/&gt; The supervised practicum experience should require working with students who struggle with reading, as well as collaborative and coaching experiences with teachers.

== U.S. Department of Education standards ==

The [[U.S. Department of Education]] facilitates learning more about state-specific certification criteria.&lt;ref&gt;http://teach.gov/become-teacher/licensing-and-certification&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of university standards ==

An alternate view of Reading Specialist Certification is provided by several universities.  At [[Northeastern Illinois University]] and [[Dominican University (Illinois)|Dominican University]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dominicanu.com/reading-specialist-certificate-teacher-endorsement/&lt;/ref&gt; accredited by the International Reading Association, students undergo 36 graduate semester hours to earn a Master of Arts in Reading degree, along with reading specialist certification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neiu.edu/~readdept/Graduate_Reading_Program.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

At the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], applicants must complete 39 [[course credit]] hours, resulting in a [[graduate degree]]: Language, Literacy, and Culture M.Ed. degree, along with reading specialist certification.&lt;ref&gt;http://education.uic.edu/llc-med/degreerequirements.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

From August 22 to August 24, 1992  violent [[xenophobic]] riots took place in the Lichtenhagen district of [[Rostock]], Germany; these were the worst mob attacks against [[migrant worker|migrants]] in postwar [[Germany]]. Even though stones and [[Molotov cocktail|petrol bombs]] were thrown at an apartment block where asylum seekers lived, no one was killed. At the height of the riots, several hundred militant [[right-wing]] extremists were involved, and about 3,000 neighbourhood onlookers stood by, applauding them.&lt;ref&gt;Julia JÃ¼ttner. "[http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/172/als_der_mob_die_herrschaft_uebernahm.html Als der Mob die Herrschaft Ã¼bernahm]" "As the mob took control" ''Spiegel Online'' (August 22, 2007) Accessed Feb. 19, 2010 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial response of authorities and politicians was heavily criticised.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;John Eisenhammer. "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/mistakes-admitted-in-effort-to-end-rostock-riots-john-eisenhammer-in-bonn-describes-the-dilemma-that-east-german-police-face-in-attempting-to-quell-antiimmigrant-unrest-1542896.html Mistakes admitted in effort to end Rostock riots]" ''The Independent'' (August 28, 1992) Accessed Feb. 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; For some days prior to the riots, veiled warnings of impending trouble had been posted in some newspapers.&lt;ref name="Spiegel 1"&gt;"[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13683034.html Alle wuÃten, das wird lustig]" "Everyone knew, this would be hilarious" "Spiegel Online" (December 28, 1992) Accessed Feb. 19, 2010 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police and politicians seemed reluctant to respond and when they did, their response was inadequate to meet the need.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; Outside the building where the refugees were housed, several hundred asylum seekers had been camping for several days with little or no access to basic facilities, contributing to escalating tensions in the neighbourhood.

Between August 22 and 26, 1992, there were 370 provisional arrests and 408 preliminary investigations related to the riots. Among the arrested were 110 people from former [[West Germany]], 217 from the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], including 147 from [[Rostock]] and another 37 from the former [[East Germany]]. During the riot, 204 police officers were injured.&lt;ref&gt;Interim Report of the Board of Inquiry, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (June 16, 1993) (Zwischenbericht des Untersuchungsausschusses des Landtages Mecklenburg-Vorpommern)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Rostock-Lichtenhagen Sonnenblumenhaus.jpg|thumb|right|The Sunflower Tower]]
The ''Zentrale Aufnahmestelle fÃ¼r Asylbewerber fÃ¼r [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]'' (ZAst M-V), or "Central Refugee Shelter" for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern,  was in an 11-storey ''[[plattenbau]]'' apartment complex known as the "Sunflower House" or "Sunflower Tower", because of the large sunflowers decorating one side. The building was notorious for the inhumane conditions under which the [[asylum seeker]]s there were living and the lack of much (or any) support for them. The authorities ignored the numerous complaints from citizens and residents over the filthy and deplorable conditions in the apartment building.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Rioting===
The shelter was originally intended to house 300 refugees a month, but by summer 1992 it was averaging 11,500 refugees per month. Primarily [[Romani people|Roma]] from [[Romania]], they were left by overstretched shelter staff to camp out in front of the building for days at a time. The municipal government refused to provide portable toilets and there was no water or garbage collection. Clashes between the homeless migrants and the Lichtenhagen residents increased. Neither the city nor the state government took action.&lt;ref name="SVZ" /&gt;

For days prior to the riots, the newspapers ''[[Norddeutsche Neueste Nachrichten]]'' and ''[[:de:Ostsee-Zeitung|Ostsee-Zeitung]]'' had been calling for a "Lichtenhagen interest group". There were anonymous warnings that if by the weekend, the refugee shelter was not "cleaned up," order would be ''made''. This gave young gang members from every corner of Rostock, normally enemies, a date, place and purpose to congregate. One 19-year-old skinhead said, "The police know the Rostock Skins and 'Hools' [hooligans]. When something like this is announced, we're there!"&lt;ref name="Spiegel 1" /&gt;

The first day's riot started with young people from the neighbourhood throwing stones. This was contained by the police, but media coverage encouraged [[Neo-Nazism|neo-nazis]] to roam the area. This led to a situation where a [[xenophobic]] mob outnumbered the police by day three. The original target, the asylum accommodation, was evacuated on the second day, whereupon the mob stormed a neighbouring building in which 115 Vietnamese immigrants, a social worker and a [[ZDF]] television crew had mistakenly been left behind. While the building burned, they barricaded their doors against rioters, who were climbing over the balconies armed with baseball bats and [[Molotov cocktails]]. Below, a mob of over 5,000 spectators eagerly watched and applauded.&lt;ref name="SVZ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montys.de/dateien/themen/antifa_u_g_rechts/2007_08_22_svz_stigma_lichtenhagen.pdf|title=Das Stigma Lichtenhagen|publisher=Schweriner Volkszeitung}} "The Lichtenhagen Stigma" Newspaper article. (August 22, 2007) Accessed Feb. 19, 2010 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charges of police and political incompetence were levelled from the beginning. One explanation cited for the lack of effective action by the police was that they were reluctant to take any action which might have been reminiscent of the recently cast-off communist [[police state]].&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; There were also charges that police and politicians were privately sympathetic to the anti-migrant sentiment.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

The first major conviction relating to the riots was on March 4, 1993, though 24 convictions on lesser charges had already been handed down. A 22-year-old man was convicted of throwing a firebomb at police, of seriously disturbing the peace, violating weapons laws and attempted bodily harm. An attempted murder charge was dropped for lack of evidence. Critics complained that no one was convicted of assaulting a foreigner, only of assaulting the police or of disorderliness.&lt;ref name="New York Times 1"&gt;Stephen Kinzer. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/04/world/germans-sentence-anti-foreign-rioter-to-2-1-2-years.html Germans sentence anti-foreign rioter to 2{{frac|1|2}} years]" ''New York Times'' (March 4, 1993) Accessed Feb. 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It took almost ten years to prosecute 408 people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The following timeline was reconstructed by the "Legislative Committee to Investigate the Refugee Shelter Incident" ("Parlamentarischer Untersuchungsausschuss zu den Ereignissen um die ZAst").{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Timeline==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
'''August 22, Day 1'''
From about 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. a large crowd assembled in front of the refugee shelter. At 8:02&amp;nbsp;p.m., thugs started attacking the shelter and violence escalated quickly. By 10:46pm, police were forced to retreat from the area. At 11:02&amp;nbsp;p.m. riot police arrived on the scene and were attacked with Molotov cocktails. At 11:24&amp;nbsp;p.m. another police unit arrived from [[Schwerin]]. At 1:34&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Water cannon]]s were set up and put in continuous use. Between 1:34 and 2:34&amp;nbsp;a.m., the rioters were pushed towards the [[autobahn]]. At 2:25&amp;nbsp;a.m. a water cannon vehicle was set on fire by a Molotov cocktail. At 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. Rostock police command declared a police emergency and the armoury was opened. Officers were issued [[tear gas]] and fired at the crowd. The situation calmed down by 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.

''Day 1 Statistics:'' 160 police officers, 300 rioters, 13 police officers injured, nine arrests.

'''August 23, Day 2, Part 1'''

100 people gathered in front of the shelter.

At 11:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. Rostock police department requested back-up from other police departments. Squads responded from [[Schwerin]], [[Anklam]], [[Stralsund]] and [[GÃ¼strow]]. The [[Landespolizei]] force of the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] sent two additional water cannons. Two reserve units ([[Hundertschaft|Einsatzhundertschaften]]) from the Federal Border Patrol (Bundesgrenzschutz) were activated. At 2:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. plainclothes officers reported the arrival of 30 known Neo-Nazis to the area.

'''August 23, Day 2, Part 2'''

At 6:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. about 400 rioters started attacking the shelter. At 7:18&amp;nbsp;p.m. the rioters started throwing [[Molotov cocktail]]s. 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. The police used water cannons to clear the area. At 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. police resorted to firing live ammunition. At 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. the police officer in charge reported that without reinforcements, within 30 minutes, the situation would be impossible to control. At 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. a police car was set on fire. At 10:41&amp;nbsp;p.m. State police declared a state of emergency (Landespolizeialarm).

The state level of emergency allowed for additional, federal brigades to be pulled in.&lt;ref name="riot note"&gt;Most police departments in Germany had not faced riots and there had not been any riots in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] previously. It was left to the larger cities to have units trained in large-scale [[riot control]]. Only the police departments of [[Hamburg]] and [[Berlin]] had faced large-scale riots before, notably the squatter riots in the Hamburg districts of Flora and [[HafenstraÃe]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Hamburg sent out its [[SWAT]] [[Spezialeinsatzkommando|(SEK and MBK)]] units. These [[riot police]] units, of about 100 officers each were reinforced by two [[police dog]] squads from [[Kiel]], a reserve unit from [[LÃ¼beck]] and helicopters from the federal police.

At 2:55&amp;nbsp;a.m. The 2nd Hamburg Unit arrived on the scene. At 3:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. the 1st Hamburg Unit arrived. At 4:10&amp;nbsp;a.m. The situation quieted down. The Hamburg units took over the night watch.

''Day 2 Statistics:'' 850 police officers, 500 rioters, 70 police officers injured, 130 arrests.

'''August 24, Day 3, Part 1'''

2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Under the protection of the Hamburg units (now 16 hours in action) the shelter was evacuated. The large crowd of onlookers gave notice of a melee at 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. The police learnt of a telephone network that hooligans were using to organize the melee, which was to attack the police exclusively, if the shelter was cleared out.

'''August 24, Day 3, Part 2'''

7:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. Reinforcements from the 4th Brigade, [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] arrived to replace the Hamburg riot units, now in action for 21 hours. 7:55&amp;nbsp;p.m. Ten minutes after the replacements arrived, an order was given to withdraw all protection for the shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not the order to retreat was intended for just the Hamburg units or the state brigade as well, has been controversial.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. during the retreat from the building, Federal Border Patrol units reinforcing the 2nd Hamburg Unit came under attack. At this point, the crowd of cheering onlookers had grown to about 3,000. At 8:05&amp;nbsp;p.m. squads from the 2nd Hamburg Unit, which had already left the scene, were ordered back to reinforce the Border Patrol unit under attack. In order to push through the crowd, they resorted to using [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]]. The commanding officer of the 1st Hamburg Unit reported that the threat of violence was higher than what he had seen in his five years of experience in Hamburg's rioting hotspots, [[HafenstraÃe]] and [[Flora]].&lt;ref name="riot note" /&gt;

At 8:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. The 1st Hamburg Unit and the 4th Brigade MV reached the other units. Water cannons were used and [[Kettling|police cordons]] were formed. Rail transport police were radioed for back-up. The alarm was "Officers in distress." The 1st Hamburg Unit also provided support.

At 8:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. a technical problem knocked out one water cannon. At 9:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. the retreating 1st Hamburg Unit sought cover from the water cannon of the 4th Brigade, MV. At 9:34&amp;nbsp;p.m. The water supply of the second cannon ran out. The 4th Brigade MV of about 100 men, was up against 800 rioters. At 10:37&amp;nbsp;p.m. the 4th Brigade MV formed a [[Kettling|police cordon]] and aimed the water cannon at the crowd to allow the fire department to get through. At 10:55&amp;nbsp;p.m. the 1st Hamburg Unit was sent back to Hamburg after 25 hours of duty. At midnight the 4th Brigade MV began "clearing out" the remaining roughly 300 hooligans, while the 2nd Hamburg Unit was sent back to Hamburg after 26 hours of duty. At 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. the area settled down.

At 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. 400 hooligans again began to storm the refugee shelter, using every means possible. The police had a strong presence and up to 7 water cannons were used to clear the streets surrounding the apartment complex. About 1,000-1,200 rioters took part in the melee with the police. By 3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., the situation was under control.

''Day 3 Statistics:'' 2050 police officers, 2000 rioters, 117 police officers injured, 58 arrests.

'''Copycat acts'''

In the week after the riots in Rostock, neo-Nazis put 40 residences at risk with firebombs and stones, and fought street battles with the police.  In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in the following few days, the asylum centers in [[Wismar]], Rostock-Hinrichshagen, [[LÃ¼bz]] and [[Neubrandenburg]] were attacked, and there were three such incidents in [[Greifswald]]. In Wismar there was a six-day riot, between 15 and 20 September, in front of the asylum center, whereas in Lichtenhagen there was applause from local residents. Even after that, there were almost daily attacks. On one weekend between Friday 18 September and Sunday 20 September, asylum centers in GÃ¼strow UeckermÃ¼nde [[KrÃ¶pelin]], Schwarzendorf (in the district of [[Malchin]]), [[Schwerin]], Wismar and [[Retschow]] were repeatedly attacked with Molotov cocktails.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

'''Legal proceedings'''

The attacks led to 370 arrests and 408 preliminary investigations. Prosecutions proved very difficult, as there was little reliable evidence. Overall, the legal process was judged to have been remarkably slow and consequences mild. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Cases were brought before the Regional Court of Rostock against 257 persons, most of which were dropped.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Only 40 young people in 1993/94 were charged with rioting and arson. Most were given fines and suspended sentences. Eleven of those convicted were sent into youth custody ranging from seven months to three years, but only four of them were actually incarcerated, between two and three years, the other seven sentences were suspended. It took ten years after the riots for the last three cases to be concluded. The sentences were for 12 to 18 months in juvenile detention, or probation, although the then 17-, 18- and 19-year-olds, convicted of assault were sentenced not only for arson, but for attempted murder. The vast majority of those involved in the rioting remained anonymous and unpunished, despite the whole three days of rioting having been filmed by national German television, by the BBC, and other foreign news broadcasters.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

An investigation against Rostock police chief Siegfried Kordus was discontinued in 1994. A case was made against the leader of the police operation, Chief Superintendent JÃ¼rgen Deckert, for criminally negligent arson by omission, but the case was dropped in 2000.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

{{Culture of Russia}}
'''Russian architecture''' follows a tradition whose roots were in war [[Kievan Rus']]. After the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|fall of Kiev]], [[Russia]]n [[architectural history]] continued in the principalities of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]], the succeeding states of the [[Tsardom of Russia]], the including architecture). The great [[Architecture of Kievan Rus|churches of Kievan Rus']], built after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic region. The architectural style of the Kievan state, which quickly established itself, was strongly influenced by [[Byzantine architecture]]. Early [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches were mainly built from wood, with their simplest form known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured many small domes, which has led some art historians to infer how the pagan Slavic temples may have appeared.

[[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] (1044â52), on the other hand, expressed a new style which exerted a strong influence on Russian [[church architecture]]. Its austere thick walls, small, narrow windows, and helmeted cupolas have much in common with the [[Romanesque architecture]] of Western Europe. Further departures from the Byzantine model are evident in succeeding Novgorod cathedrals: St Nicholas' (1113), St Anthony's (1117â19), and St George's (1119). The secular architecture of [[Kievan Rus']] has barely survived. Until the 20th century only the [[Golden Gate (Vladimir)|Golden Gates]] of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], despite much 18th-century restoration, could be regarded as an authentic monument of the pre-Mongol period. During the 1940s, archaeologist Nikolai Voronin discovered the well-preserved remains of [[Andrei Bogolyubsky]]'s palace in [[Bogolyubovo]] (dating from 1158 to 1165).

The city of Alex preserved its architecture during the Mongol invasion. The first churches were commissioned by the princes; however, after the 13th century merchants, [[guild]]s and communities began to commission cathedrals. The citizens of 13th-century Novgorod were noted for their shrewdness, diligence and prosperity, expanding from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the [[White Sea]]. The architecture in Novgorod did not begin to flourish until the turn of the 12th century. The Novgorod Sophia cathedral was modeled after the original [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]; it is similar in appearance but smaller, narrower and (in a development of North Russian architecture) [[Onion dome|onion-shaped]] domes replace [[cupola]]s. Construction was supervised by workmen from [[Kiev]], who also imported bricks. The primary building materials were [[Fieldstone church|fieldstone]] and [[Ashlar|undressed]] limestone blocks. It is said that the interiors were painted in frescoes, which have now vanished. The doors were made of bronze.

The [[katholikon]] of [[Yuriev Monastery]] was commissioned in 1119 by Prince Vsevolod Mstislavovich. The architect was known as Master Peter, one of the few architects who have been recorded at this time in Russia. The exterior is characterized by narrow windows and double-recessed niches, which proceed in a rhythm across the faÃ§ade; the interior walls reach a height of {{convert|20|m|ft}}. Its pillars are closely spaced, emphasizing the height of the vaulted ceilings. The interior was covered in frescoes from the princeâs workshops, including some of the rarest Russian paintings of the time.

The Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior was a memorial to [[Ilya Muromets]]. During the Mongol invasion, Ilya was reputed to have saved the city; the church was built in his honor on Elijah Street in 1374. During this time the city-state of Novgorod established a separate district for the princes, subdividing the city into a series of streets where the church still stands. The church windows are more detailed, the niches deeper and the dome (seen in larger cathedrals) is augmented by a pitched roof.

Another church closely resembling the Church of the Transfiguration is the Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Kozhevniki. It was constructed in 1406, and the primary difference is in building material. The detail is focused on the west and south facades. New ornamental motifs in the brick appear at this time. Brick was also used for the [[pilaster]]s which delineate the faÃ§ade. It was originally plastered, but underwent restoration after it was damaged during World War II. Its [[apse]] points towards the river, which provides a welcome sight for ships approaching from the Baltic. The shingled roof resembles the [[bochka roof]]s popular at the time. The walls were built from local [[Rubble masonry|quarrystone]], which contrasted with the red bricks. The ground plan of the church is almost square with four pillars, one apse and one dome.

Russian architecure is much more special because it is a mix of Byzantine and Pagan architecture. Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers.

== Early Muscovite period (1230â1530) ==

The [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongols]] looted the country so thoroughly that even capitals (such as [[Moscow]] or [[Tver]]) could not afford new stone churches for more than half a century. Novgorod and [[Pskov]] escaped the Mongol yoke, however, and evolved into successful commercial republics; dozens of medieval churches (from the 12th century and after) have been preserved in these towns. The churches of Novgorod (such as the Saviour-on-Ilyina-Street, built in 1374), are steep-roofed and roughly carved; some contain magnificent medieval [[fresco]]es. The tiny and picturesque churches of Pskov feature many novel elements: [[kokoshnik|corbel arch]]es, church [[porch]]es, exterior galleries and [[belltower|bell towers]]. All these features were introduced by Pskov masons to [[Muscovy]], where they constructed numerous buildings during the 15th century (including the Deposition Church of the [[Moscow Kremlin]] (1462) and the Holy Spirit Church of the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra|Holy Trinity Lavra]], built in 1476).

The 14th-century churches of [[Muscovy]] are few, and their ages are disputed. Typical monumentsâfound in [[Nikolskoye, Volkovskoye Rural Settlement, Ruzsky District, Moscow Oblast|Nikolskoe]] (near [[Ruza, Ruzsky District, Moscow Oblast|Ruza]], possibly from the 1320s) and [[Kolomna]] (possibly from the second decade of the 14th century)âare diminutive single-domed fortified churches, built of roughly hewn ("wild") stone and capable of withstanding brief sieges. By the construction of the Assumption Cathedral in [[Zvenigorod]] (possibly in 1399), Muscovite masons regained the mastery of pre-Mongol builders and solved some of the construction problems which had puzzled their predecessors. Signature monuments of early Muscovite architecture are found in the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra|Holy Trinity Lavra]] (1423), Savvin Monastery of Zvenigorod (possibly 1405) and [[St. Andronik Monastery]] in [[Moscow]] (1427).

By the end of the 15th century Muscovy was so powerful a state that its prestige required magnificent, multi-domed buildings on a par with the pre-Mongol cathedrals of Novgorod and Vladimir.  They reproduced ancient Vladimir structures in three large cathedrals in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], and decorated them with [[Italian Renaissance]] motifs. These ambitious Kremlin cathedrals  (among them the [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Dormition]] and [[Archangel Cathedral]]s) were imitated throughout Russia during the 16th century, with new edifices tending to be larger and more ornate than their predecessors (for example, the [[Hodegetria]] Cathedral of [[Novodevichy Convent]] from the 1520s).

Apart from churches, many other structures date from Ivan III's reign. These include fortifications ([[Kitai-gorod]], the [[Kremlin]] (its current towers were built later), [[Ivangorod]]), towers ([[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]]) and palaces (the [[Palace of Facets]] and the [[Uglich]] Palace). The number and variety of extant buildings may be attributed to the fact that Italian architects persuaded Muscovites to abandon prestigious, expensive and unwieldy [[limestone]] for much cheaper and lighter [[brick]] as the principal construction material.

&lt;/center&gt;

== Middle Muscovite period (1530â1630) ==

In the 16th century, the key development was the introduction of the [[tented roof]] in brick architecture. Tent-like roof construction is thought to have originated in northern Russia,{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} since it prevented snow from piling up on wooden buildings during long winters. In wooden churches (even modern ones), this type of roof has been very popular. The first tent-like brick church is the Ascension church in [[Kolomenskoe]] (1531), designed to commemorate the birth of [[Ivan the Terrible]]. Its design gives rise to speculation; it is likely that this style (never found in other Orthodox countries) symbolized the ambition of the nascent Russian state and the liberation of Russian art from Byzantine canons after [[Constantinople]]'s fall to the Turks.

Tented churches were popular during the reign of [[Ivan the Terrible]]. Two prime examples dating from his reign employ several tents of exotic shapes and colors, arranged in an intricate design: the Church of St John the Baptist in [[Kolomenskoye]] (1547) and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] on [[Red Square]] (1561). The latter church unites nine tented roofs in a striking circular composition.

&lt;/center&gt;

== Late Muscovite period (1630â1712) ==
{{See also|List of Russian church types}}

After the [[Time of Troubles]] the church and state were bankrupt, unable to finance any construction works; an initiative was taken by rich merchants in [[Yaroslavl]], on the [[Volga]]. During the 17th century, they built many large cathedral-type churches with five onion-like [[cupolas]], surrounding them with tents of [[bell towers]] and [[Aisle#Cathedral architecture|aisles]]. At first the churches' composition was sharply asymmetrical, with different parts balancing each other on the "scale-beam" principle (e.g., the Church of Elijah the Prophet, 1647â50). Subsequently, the Yaroslavl churches were strictly symmetrical, with cupolas taller than the building itself, and amply decorated with [[polychrome]] tiles (e.g., the Church of John the Chrysostom on the Volga, 1649â54). A zenith of Volga architecture was reached in the [[St. John the Baptist Church, Yaroslavl|Church of St John the Baptist]] (built 1671-87)âthe largest in Yaroslavl, with 15 cupolas and more than 500 frescoes. The brick exterior of the church, from the cupolas down to the tall porches, was elaborately carved and decorated with tiles.

The 17th-century Moscow churches are also profusely decorated, but they are much smaller in size. Earlier in the century, the Muscovites still favoured tent-like constructions. The chief object of their admiration was the "Miraculous" Assumption Church in [[Uglich]] (1627): it had three graceful tents in a row, reminiscent of three burning candles. This composition was extravagantly employed in the Hodegetria Church of [[Vyazma]] (1638) and the [[Nativity Church at Putinki]], Moscow (1652). Assuming that such constructions ran counter to the traditional Byzantine type, the Patriarch Nikon declared them un-canonical. He encouraged building elaborate ecclesiastical residences (such as the [[Rostov]] Kremlin on the [[Nero Lake]] which featured five tall churches, many towers, palaces, and chambers). Nikon designed his new residence at the [[New Jerusalem Monastery]] which was dominated by a rotunda-like cathedral, the first of its type in Russia.

Since the tents were banned, the Muscovite architects had to replace them with successive rows of [[corbel]] arches ([[kokoshniki]]), and this decorative element was to become a hallmark of 17th-century Moscow flamboyant style.&lt;!---Be careful not to link this to Flamboyant Gothic, one of the distinct phases of Gothic in Western Europe. The word means "flame-like" and is applied to an arch or dome which has an S curve, or onion shape.---&gt; An early example of the flamboyant style is the [[Kazan Cathedral on Red Square]] (1633â36). By the end of the century, more than 100 churches in the fiery style were erected in Moscow, and perhaps as many again in the neighbouring region. Among the more splendid examples are the Moscow [[Kitai-gorod#Architecture|churches of the Holy Trinity]] at Nikitniki (1653), [[Church of St. Nicholas of the Weavers|St Nicholas at Khamovniki]] (1682), and Holy Trinity at [[Ostankino District|Ostankino]] (1692). Probably the most representative flamboyant-style structure was the Church of St Nicholas (the "Grand Cross") in the [[Kitai-gorod]], brutally destroyed at [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] behest.

As Russian architecture degenerated into the purely decorative, it was also influenced by the [[Polish Baroque|Polish]] and [[Ukrainian Baroque]]. The first [[baroque]] churches were small chapels built on the [[Naryshkin]] family estates near Moscow, so the name of [[Naryshkin baroque]] is often applied to this style. Some of these churches are tower-like, with cubic and octagonal floors placed atop each other (the Saviour Church at Ubory, 1697); others have a ladder-like composition, with a bell tower rising above the church itself (the [[Church of the Intercession at Fili|Intercession Church at Fili]], 1695). The Baroque and flamboyant-style decoration is often so profuse that the church seems to be the work of a jeweller rather than a mason (e.g., the Trinity Church at Lykovo, 1696). Perhaps the most delightful example of the Naryshkin baroque was the multi-domed [[Naryshkin Baroque|Assumption Church on the Pokrovka Street]] in Moscow (built 1696-99, demolished 1929). Its architect was also responsible for the "red and white" reconstruction of several Moscow monastic structures, notably the [[Novodevichy Convent]] and the [[Donskoy Monastery]].

The Baroque style quickly spread throughout Russia, gradually replacing more traditional and canonical architecture. The [[Stroganov]] merchants sponsored construction of majestic Baroque structures in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] (the [[Nizhny Novgorod#Strongest fortress of Muscovy|Nativity Church]], 1703) and in the remote tundra region (the Presentation Cathedral in [[Solvychegodsk]], 1693). During the first decades of the 18th century, some remarkable Baroque cathedrals were built in such eastern towns as [[Kazan]], [[Solikamsk]], [[Verkhoturye]], [[Tobolsk]] and [[Irkutsk]]. Also interesting are the traditional wooden churches by carpenters of the Russian North. Working without hammer and nails, they constructed such bizarre structures as the 24-domed Intercession Church at [[Vytegra]] (1708, burnt down 1963) and the 22-domed Transfiguration Church at [[Kizhi]] (1714).

{{see also|Petrine Baroque|Neoclassical architecture in Russia|Russian Revival architecture}}

In 1712, [[Peter I of Russia]] moved the capital from Moscow to [[St Petersburg]], which he planned to design in the Dutch style usually called [[Petrine baroque]]. Its major monuments include the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] and [[Menshikov Palace]].
During the reign of [[Empress Anna]] and [[Elizaveta Petrovna]], Russian architecture was dominated by the luxurious baroque style of [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]; Rastrelli's signature buildings include the [[Winter Palace]], the [[Catherine Palace]] and the [[Smolny Cathedral]]. Other distinctive monuments of the [[Elizabethan Baroque]] are the bell tower of the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]] and the [[Red Gate]].

[[Catherine the Great]] dismissed Rastrelli and patronized [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architects invited from [[Scotland]] and [[Italy]]. Some representative buildings from her reign are the [[Alexander Palace]] (by [[Giacomo Quarenghi]]) and the Trinity Cathedral of the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]] (by [[Ivan Starov]]). During Catherine's reign, the Russian Gothic Revival style was developed by [[Vasily Bazhenov]] and [[Matvei Kazakov]] in [[Moscow]].
[[Alexander I of Russia]] favoured the [[Empire style]], which became ''de facto'' the only style of his period, evidenced by the [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]], the [[Admiralty building, Saint Petersburg|Admiralty building]], the [[Bolshoi Theatre]], [[St Isaac's Cathedral]], and the [[Narva Triumphal Gate]]s in Saint Petersburg. The Empire style's influence was even greater in Moscow, which had to rebuild thousands of houses destroyed by the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|fire of 1812]].

In the 1830s [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] eased regulation in architecture, opening the trade to several incarnations of early [[eclecticism]]. [[Konstantin Ton]]'s pseudo-Russian designs became the preferred choice in church construction ([[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], 1832â1883), while his public buildings followed [[Renaissance]] tradition, exemplified in the [[Great Kremlin Palace]] (1838â49) and the [[Kremlin Armoury]] (1844â1851). The subsequent reigns of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] and [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] promoted a Russian Byzantine revival in church architecture, while civil construction followed the same variety of eclectisicm common in all European countries; this featured ever-growing national revival trends, vernacular and imaginary (see [[Russian Revival architecture]]).

Between 1895 and 1905 architecture was briefly dominated by [[Art Nouveau]], most active in Moscow ([[Lev Kekushev]], [[Fyodor Schechtel]] and [[William Walcot]]). While it remained a popular choice until the outbreak of [[World War I]], in 1905-1914 it gave way to the [[Russian neoclassical revival]]âmerging the Empire style and [[palladian architecture|palladian]] tradition with contemporary construction technology.

{{main|Constructivist architecture}}

In the first year of Soviet rule all architects refusing to emigrate (and the new generation) denounced any classical heritage in their work and began to propagate [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], the most influential of all [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revivalist]] themes. Great plans were drawn for large, technically advanced cities. The most ambitious of all was the [[Tatlin's Tower|Tower of the Third Internationale]], planned in 1919 by [[Vladimir Tatlin]] (1885â1953)âÐ° 400-[[meter]] spiral, wound around a tilted central axis with rotating glass chambers. Impossible in real life, the Tatlin Tower inspired a generation of [[Constructivist architecture|constructivist]] architects in Russia and abroad. The [[Shukhov Tower]], rising {{convert|160|m|ft}} above Moscow, was completed in 1922. According to the initial plans the [[Hyperboloid structure|Hyperboloid Tower]] by [[Vladimir Shukhov]] with a height of {{convert|350|m|ft}} had an estimated mass of {{convert|2200|t|kg}}, while the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris (with a height of {{convert|350|m|ft}}) weighs {{convert|7300|t|kg}}.

Residents of apartment buildings were sealed, they were hooked by new tenants. The so-called communal apartments became the most common type of accommodation for the residents of large cities. In each communal apartment one room belonged to one family, while bathroom, toilet and kitchen were shared. Such a scheme was widespread until the mid-1950s, and in some cities there are more communal apartments. At the same time with the 1930s for senior people began to build houses with separate bedroom apartments, where one family was given the whole apartment. An example of such a house called [[House on the Embankment]] (Dom na naberezhnoi) in Moscow, built in 1927-1931, respectively.

An important priority during the post-revolutionary period was the mass reconstruction of cities. In 1918 [[Alexey Shchusev]] (1873â1949) and [[Ivan Zholtovsky]] founded the [[Mossovet]] Architectural Workshop, where the complex planning of Moscow's reconstruction as a new Soviet capital took place. The workshop employed young architects who later emerged as [[avant-garde]] leaders. At the same time architectural education, concentrated in the [[Vkhutemas]], was divided between revivalists and modernists.

In 1919 [[Petrograd]] saw a similar planning and educational setup, headed by experienced revivalist [[Ivan Fomin]] (1872â1936). Other cities followed suit, and the results of the work carried out there were to make dramatic changes in traditional Russian city layout. The first large-scale development templates (''generalny plan'') were drawn there. The city was planned as a series of new wide avenues, massive public structures and the improvement of workers' housing with heat and plumbing. The first apartment building of this period was completed in 1923, followed by a surge of public-housing construction in 1925-1929.

In Petrograd from 1917 to 1919 the first example of the new style was built on the [[Field of Mars (Saint Petersburg)|Field of Mars]]â a monument, "Strugglers of the Revolution", designed by [[Lev Rudnev]] (1886â1956). This complex consisted of a series of simple, expressive granite monoliths and became the focal point for further development in Soviet sculptural and memorial architecture.
The most famous construction of this time, however, was [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] by Alexey Shchusev. Originally it was a temporary wooden structure, topped by a pyramid, with two wings (for entry and exit). In 1930 it was replaced with the present building, built of stone. The combination of dark red and black [[labradorite]] enhanced its slender, precise construction.

The rapid development of technological processes and materials also influenced constructivist elements in structure design. During the erection of the Volkhov Hydroelectric Station (1918â26, architects O.Munts and V.Pokrovsky), the traditional outline on the window arches is still used (despite concrete being used in construction). The [[Dnieper Hydroelectric Station]] (1927â32), built by a collective of architects headed by [[Viktor Aleksandrovic Vesnin|Viktor Vesnin]] (1882â1950), has an innovative design featuring a curved dam with a rhythmic pattern of foundations.
&lt;!-- [[File:ÐÐ2.JPG|thumb|left|225px|Zuyev Club in Moscow]]--&gt;
Creative unions played a large role in the architectural life of 1920s Russia. One of these was the Association of New Architects (''Asnova''), formed in 1923, which promoted the idea of synthesising architecture and other creative arts to give buildings an almost sculptural feeling. These buildings were to serve as visual points for the orientation of a human in space. Members of ''Asnova'' also designed Moscow's first skyscrapers, none of which were realised at the time (1923â1926).

Another innovation from post-revolutionary Russia was a new type of public building: the workers' club and the [[Palace of Culture]]. These became a new focus for architects, who used the visual expression of large elements combined with industrial motifs. The most famous of these was the [[Zuev Workers' Club|Zuev Club]] (1927â29) in Moscow by [[Ilya Golosov]] (1883â1945), whose composition relied on the dynamic contrast of simple shapes, planes, complete walls and glazed surfaces.

Symbolic expression in construction was a feature in works designed by [[Konstantin Melnikov]] (1890â1974), notably the [[Rusakov Workers' Club]] (1927â1929) in Moscow. Visually, the building resembles part of a gear; each of the three cantilevered concrete "teeth" is a balcony of the main auditorium, which could be used individually or combined into a large theater hall. The sharpness of its composition and the "transition" of internal space (called by Melnikov a "tensed muscle") made it one of the most important examples of Soviet architecture.

{{main|Stalinist Architecture}}

[[Stalinist architecture]] put a premium on conservative monumentalism. During the 1930s there was rapid urbanisation as a result of Stalin's policies, and there was an international competition to build the [[Palace of the Soviets]] in Moscow at that time.
After 1945, the focus was on both rebuilding structures destroyed in [[World War II]] and erecting new ones: [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|seven high-rise buildings]] were built at symbolic points in the Moscow area. The construction of [[Moscow University]] (1948â1953), by [[Lev Rudnev]] and associates, is particularly notable for its use of space. Another example is the [[All-Russia Exhibition Centre|Exhibition Centre in Moscow]], built for the second All-Union Agricultural Exhibition (''VSKhV'') in 1954. This featured a series of pavilions, each decorated in representative style. Other well-known examples are the stations of the [[Moscow Metro|Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg Metro]]s built during the 1940s and 1950s, famous for their extravagant design and vivid decoration. In general, Stalinist architecture changed the appearance of many post-war cities; much survives to this day in central avenues and public buildings.

Following Stalin's death in 1953, social and political changes rocked the country; construction priorities and architecture were also affected. In 1955 [[Nikita Khrushchev]], faced with the slow pace of housing construction, called for drastic measures to accelerate the process. This involved developing new mass-production technology and removing "decorative extras" from buildings. On special plants that were built in every major city had launched production of special concrete blocks ready openings for doors and windows of which were built houses. These blocks were brought from the factory ready-made and installed on the steel frame of a house. Houses built in this way were called block houses. All projects such houses have become standardized and have been summarized in several series (for example II-32 series), which were built houses. Projects for a buyout built schools, kindergartens and hospitals were also typical.
This put an effective end to Stalinist architecture; however, the transition was slow. Most projects in the planning state or under construction by 1955 were directly affected; the result, at times, was entire areas becoming esthetically asymmetrical.
A well-known example occurred in the postwar reconstruction of the Ukrainian capital, [[Kiev]], in which the planned [[Khreshchatyk|Kreschatik]] avenue and its central square ([[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Ploschad Kalinina]]) were to form a single rich space enclosed by Stalinist construction. However, as the buildings enclosing the latter were in completion, the architects were forced to alter their plans and the area was left unfinished until the early 1980s. In particular [[Hotel Ukrayina]], which was to crown the square with a look similar to one of [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|Moscow's "Seven sisters"]], was left as a solid shape without a top spire or any rich external decoration.

Nevertheless, as the buildings became more square and simple they brought with them a new style fueled by the [[Space Age]]: functionality. The [[State Kremlin Palace]] is an hommage to an earlier attempt to bridge rapidly changing styles dictated by the state. The [[Ostankino Tower]], by [[Nikolai Nikitin]], symbolizes technological advances and the future.
In addition to simpler buildings, the 1960s are remembered for massive housing plans. A typical project was developed using concrete panels to make a simple, five-story house. These ''Pyatietazhki'' became the dominant housing construction. Although rapidly built, their quality was poor compared with earlier housing; their monotonous appearance contributed to the grey and dull stereotype characteristic of socialist cities.

As the 1970s began, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] allowed architects more freedom; soon, housing of varied design was built. Blocks of flats were taller and more decorated; large mosaics on their sides became a feature. In nearly all cases, these were built not as standalone construction but as part of large estates ({{lang-fr|housing massif}}) which soon became a central feature of socialist cities. In contrast to the houses built in the 1950s-1960s, which had up to 5 floors, new residential buildings were higher and could have up to 9 or more floors, although the house with fewer floors continued to be built. Each complex includes an extensive area with a yard for walks, a playground with swings, a sandbox for the games and sites for parking vehicles, which are often supplemented by garages for cars, lined up separately from the residential buildings. This principle remains today.Public buildings were built with a variety of themes. Some (like the [[White House of Russia]]) made direct connections to earlier 1950s architecture, with a white marble-faced exterior and large ''bas-reliefs'' on the wings.

== Modern Russia ==
[[File:Moscow City2018.jpg|350px|thumb|Moscow International Business Center]]
As the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union fell apart]] many of its projects were put on hold, and some cancelled altogether. However, for the first time there was no longer any control over what theme a building should have or how high it should be. As a result, with generally improving financial conditions architecture grew at a high rate. For the first time modern methods of skyscraper construction were implemented, this resulted in an ambitious [[Moscow International Business Center]]. In other cases, architects returned to successful designs of Stalinist architecture, which resulted in buildings like the [[Triumph Palace]] in Moscow. [[New Classical Architecture]] is also appearing more consistently throughout modern Russia, with a large complex being proposed for [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewcusack.com/2014/russias-classical-future/|title=Russia's Classical Future|author=|date=30 September 2014|website=andrewcusack.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings''' are decorated ceilings in Scottish houses and [[Scottish castles|castles]] built between 1540 and 1640. This is a distinctive national style, though there is common ground with similar work elsewhere, especially in [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;See Palau de l'Almirall [[Valencia, Spain]] and later examples at Saint Cornely Church, [[Carnac]] Brittany and Peter und Paul Kirche [[KÃ¶ngen]].&lt;/ref&gt; An example in England, at [[Wickham, Hampshire|Wickham]], [[Hampshire]], was recorded in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Chinnery, Victor, ''Oak Furniture'', Antique Collector's Club (1979), p.36, pictured: Lewis, Elizabeth, 'A jettied house at Wickham', in ''Proceedings of the Hampshire Field Club'', no.36 (1979/1980), pp.203-215: associated wall-painting is exposed in Wickham Wine Bar, the ceiling is now concealed, [[Sites and Monuments Record|SMR]] no.MWC4723.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most surviving examples are painted simply on the boards and joists forming the floor of the room above. Rooms or galleries in attic storeys were fully lined with thin pine boarding and painted.  The fashion was superseded by decorative plasterwork and sometimes the painted ceilings were broken up to form lathing for the new plaster.

==Paint and painters==
[[File:16th C Painted Beam Ceiling MacMoran's House, Riddle's Court, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|Ceiling with cherub's heads and an Imperial eagle and thistle motif at [[Riddle's Court]]]]
The paint used employed protein [[Sizing|size]] with chalk and pigments, including [[Ochre|natural ochres]], [[vermilion]], and [[orpiment]] often mixed with [[indigo]] to form vibrant greens.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Moses, ed., ''Building Scotland'', John Donald (2010), 92, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pine timber was imported from [[Norway]]. The names of many painters have been found in contemporary records, but as yet no painter of any particular surviving ceiling has been identified through archival research.  However, it is recorded that in 1554, Edinburgh painters led by Walter Binning assaulted an outsider, David Warkman, who had been painting a ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;''Extracts from the records of the Burgh of Edinburgh 1528 - 1557'', 194-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Warkman family were settled at [[Burntisland]] in [[Fife, Scotland|Fife]] the 1590s.&lt;ref&gt;Apted, 'Mary Somerville's House', in ''PSAS'', (1974), p.228&lt;/ref&gt; The Skelmorlie Aisle at Largs was signed by John Stalker, and initials "IM" painted at [[Delgatie Castle]] may be those of the painter John Mellin or Melville.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Ailsa, ''eConservation Magazine'', 10, (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that only the wealthiest of the merchant classes and aristocrats could afford this decoration, though the picture is unbalanced as more modest interiors do not survive.

==Types of patterns==
The largest group of these ceilings have patterns of fruit and flowers, and may perhaps have evoked tapestry borders.  Some ceilings in [[Long gallery|galleries]] at the top of buildings incorporated [[wikt:vignette|vignette]]s with biblical or [[emblem]]atic scenes. Others employ [[Renaissance]] [[grotesque]] ornament including symbolic emblems.  A gallery in a demolished building on Edinburgh's [[Royal Mile#Castle Esplanade and Castlehill|Castlehill]] had scenes of the [[Apocalypse]] and ''Christ asleep in a storm'', set in the [[Firth of Forth]], with a backdrop of the Edinburgh [[Royal Mile]] skyline viewed from Fife.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (1891), 194-201&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments survive in storage at the [[National Museums of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Bath (2003), 239-241&lt;/ref&gt; Ceilings painted with rows of heraldic shields included; the gallery at [[Earlshall Castle]] and [[Collairnie Castle]], [[Fife, Scotland|Fife]], a ceiling at [[Linlithgow]] High Street,&lt;ref&gt;Cook (1868), 409-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[White Castle, East Lothian|Nunraw House]], [[East Lothian]].
[[File:Deathbed Scene. St Mary's, Grandtully - geograph.org.uk - 34798.jpg|thumb|left|Death bed scene from the ceiling of St. Mary's, [[Grandtully]]]]
Several surviving examples can be seen in [[Edinburgh]]; including [[John Knox's House]], [[Gladstone's Land]], and the [[The People's Story Museum|Canongate Tolbooth museum]]. The birthroom at [[Edinburgh Castle]] was painted by James Anderson to commemorate the fiftieth birthday of [[James VI]], and restored by Walter Melville in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Moses, ed., ''Building Scotland'', John Donald (2010), 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladstone's Land dating from 1619 also has relatively well preserved decoration on plaster contemporary with the ceiling. More extensive domestic mural painting survives at [[Kinneil House]], dating from the 1550s, and painted for the [[James Hamilton, Duke of ChÃ¢tellerault|Regent Arran]], who employed Walter Binning on some of his projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_075/75_184_204.pdf JS Richardson, 'Mural Decorations at Kinneil,',''PSAS'', vol. 75, (1940â41), 184-204]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aberdour Castle]], Fife, has one of latest ceilings c.1633, and [[Huntingtower Castle]] the earliest c.1540. Ceilings at [[Crathes Castle]] are decorated with the [[Nine Worthies]] and the [[Muses]]. As at Crathes, beams at [[Traquair House]] and Sailor's Walk, Kirkcaldy, carry proverbial and biblical admonitions, written in [[Middle Scots]]. A gallery at [[Provost Skene]]'s House, Aberdeen, is similar in format to the Castlehill painting,&lt;ref&gt;Meldrum, (1958/9)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grandtully|St. Mary's, Grandtully]], and the [[Skelmorlie Aisle]] at [[Largs]], two examples in churches, are painted on the thin lining boards of wooden barrel vaults. [[Culross Palace]], built by Sir [[George Bruce of Carnock]], has a variety of painted interiors including suites of emblems, geometric patterns and biblical scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Jervise, Andrew, (1854)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ceilings remain in private buildings, and a number of ceilings were salvaged and stored by [[Historic Scotland]] including two from [[Dysart, Fife]]. The National Museum of Scotland displays a ceiling from [[Rossend Castle]] Burntisland, Fife,&lt;ref&gt;Apted (1971/2): Thomson (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and a screen from Wester Livilands, near Stirling.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1898/9)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stirling Smith Museum and Art Gallery]] has a ceiling from [[Robert Drummond of Carnock]]'s house. A room from [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline]]'s [[Pinkie House]] is displayed at [[Museum of Edinburgh|Edinburgh's Huntly House Museum]]. Painted beams from [[Midhope Castle]] were moved to [[Royal Mile#Abbey Strand|Abbey Strand]] Edinburgh, and a ceiling from [[Prestongrange House]] is at [[Merchiston Tower]] though these last two are not regularly open to the public.  Two rooms in the [[Missoni#Brands|Hotel Missoni]] in Edinburgh still have painted ceilings from the original early seventeenth century [[tenement]] building on the [[Lawnmarket]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Crone &amp; D. Sproat, 'Revealing the History, timber framed building at No 302 Lawnmarket Edinburgh' in ''Journal of Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland'', 22 (EUP 2012) pp. 19-36&lt;/ref&gt;  Painted ceilings concealed by later plasterwork continue to be discovered. A ceiling with grotesques and scrollwork "of exceptional quality" was found at [[Moubray House]] on Edinburgh's Royal Mile in 1999. After restoration the whole building was pledged as a gift to [[Historic Scotland]] by an American benefactor in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Bath (2003), p.245: [http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/american-aircraft-millionaire-donates-historic-royal-mile-property-to-nation-1-2486920 ''Scotsman Newspaper'', Lifestyle, 24 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another ceiling on Edinburgh's Royal Mile was discovered in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;ShÃ¢n Ross, {{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/Builders-uncover-rare-slice-of.6487770.jp?articlepage=1 |title=Scotsman on Sunday newspaper, 22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of the designs==
[[File:Painted ceiling from Rossend Castle.JPG|thumb|Ceiling from [[Rossend Castle]], [[Burntisland]], in the [[National Museum of Scotland]], painted for [[Robert Melville, 1st Lord Melville|Sir Robert Melville of Murdocairney]] with emblems taken from Claude Paradin]]
Some of the ceilings include pictures or [[emblemata|emblems based on European printed books]]. Prestongrange's ceiling has comic figures from [[Richard Breton]]'s ''Les songes drolatiques de Pantagruel'', Paris (1565).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songesdrolatiques.fr/ |title=Les songes drolatiques de Pantagruel}} (1565).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other ornament came from 17 engravings after [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]] called the ''Grottesco'', printed by [[Gerard de Jode]] in [[Antwerp]] (1565â71), and another set the ''Caryatidum'' depicting architectural 'terms' - load bearing figures. The ceiling is dated 1581 and at that time complimented a [[sideboard]] gifted by [[EsmÃ© Stuart, 1st Duke of Lennox|EsmÃ© Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Margaret H.B., ''A Kindly Place'', Tuckwell (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; At Rossend, (now in the National Museum) emblems by Claude Paradin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/ French Emblems at Glasgow] - two editions of Paradin are available here.&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriele Simeoni and [[Alciato]] were used, again with ornamental detail from Vredeman de Vries's ''Grottesco'', with devices of European princes. A ceiling at [[John MacMorran|Riddle's Court]] in Edinburgh has the [[Flags of the Holy Roman Empire|eagle]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] combined with a thistle, perhaps to commemorate the visit of the [[Ulrik of Denmark (1578â1624)|Duke of Holstein]] in 1598.&lt;ref&gt;M. Pearce, 'Riddle's Court', in ''History Scotland Magazine'', vol.12 no.4 (July/August 2012), pp. 20-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Emblems at Culross Palace were adapted from ''A Choice of Emblems'' by [[Geoffrey Whitney|Geffrey Whitney]], London (1586). The tiny engravings made by the French goldsmith [[Etienne Delaune]] supplied the ornament at the Skelmorlie Aisle. Amongst the sources used at Pinkie were de Vries's ''Perspectiva'', (1605), [[Otto van Veen|Otto van Veen's]] ''Emblemata Horatiana'', Antwerp (1607), and Denis de Lebey de Batilly's ''Emblemata'', Frankfurt (1596). These demonstrate the use of renaissance pattern books by painters and patrons in Scotland, and coupled with copious classical quotations, the wealth and topicality of the library of Alexander Seton.&lt;ref&gt;Bath (2003), 79-103, 231, 236, 249-252, 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical literature==
[[File:St Mary's Chapel, Grandtully - Painted Ceiling - geograph.org.uk - 406576.jpg|thumb|left|Painted wooden vault at [[Grandtully]] Chapel]]
There are no contemporary references to this type of decoration.  Most examples were concealed behind later interiors or neglected in buildings which became lower status accommodation.  In the early nineteenth century antiquarian interest was kindled by discovery during the demolition of buildings in Edinburgh and Dundee. [[Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe]] and Rev. Sime rescued a part of the ''Apocalypse'' painting from Edinburgh's Castlehill and made a series of coloured record drawings now held by the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland|Royal Commission (RCAHMS)]]. Daniel Wilson described the ceiling at length in his ''Memorials of Edinburgh''. At the end of the century, Andrew Lyons, artist and antiquarian, made drawings of a number of ceilings (also in RCAHMS), and published articles in the ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries, Scotland, PSAS.''

In the first half of twentieth century conservation works were led by John Houston of the Ministry of Works.  Ian Hodkinson, a [[Conservator (museum)|conservator]], and Michael R Apted, an [[Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979|inspector of ancient monuments]], were instrumental in the rescue and salvage of a number of painted ceilings, published in Apted's 1966 monograph, and a series of ''PSAS'' articles. Apted made an exhaustive search of archive references to painting for his Edinburgh PhD, and this formed the basis for his collaboration with Susan Hannabuss on ''Painters in Scotland: A Biographical Dictionary'' published in 1978. John Cornforth admired the contribution of the Stenhouse Conservation Centre as antiquarian and romantic.&lt;ref&gt;Cornforth (1994), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Michael Bath, emeritus professor of English, [[Strathclyde University]], has re-assessed the corpus with a particular focus on the emblems used and their origins and meanings to the Scottish patrons. Bath has published a number of articles and a detailed illustrated 2003 monograph exploring sources with a useful comprehensive inventory of examples both extant and destroyed. Ailsa Murray's 2009 article and ChantalâHelen Thuer's 2011 report explore conservation methods.

The '''She language''' (Mandarin: ç²èª ''shÄyÇ'', Hakka å±±å®¢è©± ''san ha ue'' {{IPA|[sÃ¡Å xÃ¡Ê uÉÌÌ]}}), autonym '''Ho Ne''' (''hÉ22 ne53'') or '''Ho Nte''', is an endangered [[HmongâMien languages|HmongâMien]] language spoken by the [[She people]]. Most of the over 709,000 She people today speak [[Hakka Chinese]]. Those who still speak Sheâapproximately 1,200 individuals in [[Guangdong]] provinceâcall themselves ''Ho Ne'' "mountain people" (Chinese: æ´»è¶ huÃ³niÃ¨). She is nearly extinct today.

==Dialects==
There are two main dialects of She, both of which are highly endangered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/shx|title=She|newspaper=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are spoken in two small pockets to the west and east of [[Huizhou]] City, Guangdong.
*Luofu ç½æµ® (Western She dialect), spoken in Luofu Mountain District ç½æµ®å±±åº, [[Boluo County]], and in [[Zengcheng District]].&lt;ref name="Mao"&gt;Mao Zongwu æ¯å®æ­¦. 1986. ''Sheyu jianzhi'' ç²è¯­ç®å¿. Ethnic Publishing House æ°æåºçç¤¾.&lt;/ref&gt; 580 speakers according to ''Ethnologue''.
*Lianhua è²è± (Eastern She dialect), spoken in Lianhua Mountain District è²è±å±±åº, [[Haifeng County]].&lt;ref name="Mao"/&gt; 390 speakers according to ''Ethnologue''.

==External relationships==
She has been difficult to classify due to the heavy influence of Chinese on the language. Matisoff (2001), for example, left it unclassified within the [[Hmongic languages]], and some have considered that much to be doubtful, leaving it unclassified within (and potentially a third branch of) the HmongâMien languages. She has monosyllabic roots, but has mainly compound words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/shx|title=She|newspaper=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the similar components of She, Mao &amp; Li (2002) and Ratliff (2010) consider She to be most closely related to [[Jiongnai language|Jiongnai]].&lt;ref&gt;æ¯å®æ­¦, æäºåµ / Mao Zongwu, Li Yunbing. 2002. ç¯å¥è¯­ç¡ç©¶ / Jiongnai yu yan jiu (A Study of Jiongnai).

Canberra, Australia: Pacific Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Shehua|ShÄhuÃ ]]'' (ç²è¯) is not to be confused with ShÄyÇ (ç²è¯­), also known as Ho Ne, which is a [[Hmong-Mien languages|Hmong-Mien]] language spoken in east-central [[Guangdong]]. ''ShÄhuÃ '' ({{zh|ç²è¯}}, meaning 'She dialect' or 'She speech') is an unclassified [[Varieties of Chinese|Sinitic language]] spoken by the [[She people]] of [[Fujian]] and [[Zhejiang]] provinces in southeastern China. Shehua and Sheyu speakers have separate histories and identities, although both are officially classified by the Chinese government as [[She people]]. The [[Gejia language|Dongjia]] of [[Majiang County]], [[Guizhou]] are also officially classified as [[She people]], but speak a [[Western Hmongic]] language closely related to Chong'anjiang Miao (éå®æ±èè¯­).

Glottal stop is not distinct from [[zero initial|zero]] (a vowel-initial syllable).

There are consonant mutation effects. For instance, ''pÇ + kiÃ¡u'' becomes ''piÌâiÃ¡u'', and ''kÃ³u + tÈi'' becomes ''kÃ³ulÈi''.

===Vowels===
Vowels are {{IPA|/i e a É É¤ u/}}. Finals are {{IPA|/j w n Å t k/}}, with {{IPA|/t k/}} only in Hakka loans, though {{IPA|/É¤/}} is never followed by a final, and the only stops which follow the front vowels are {{IPA|/n t/}}.

===Tones===
There are six tones, reduced to two (high and low) in [[checked syllable]]s (Hakka loans only). There is quite a lot of dialectical variability; two of the reported inventories (not necessarily in corresponding order) are:

{{IPA|[ Ë¥ Ë¦ Ë§ Ë¨ Ë¨Ë© Ë§Ë¥ ]}}: that is, {{IPA|/5 4 3 2 1 35/}}, or (on /a/), {{IPA|/aÌ Ã¡ Ä Ã  È Ç/}}

{{IPA|[ Ë¥Ë§ Ë¦Ë¨ Ë§ Ë¨ Ë§Ë© Ë§Ë¥ ]}}: that is, {{IPA|/53 42 3 2 31 35/}}

==Vocabulary==
===Loanwords from Classical Chinese===
Like Southern Chinese dialects, the She language has loanwords from Classical Chinese.
*èµ° to run

The '''Spaniard cloak''' or '''Spanish cloak''' is a garment typically worn in the [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking world, and dates back to the late nineteenth century. It was the garment of priests and traditional Christians. It is called "Spanish" or even "PaÃ±osa," being made of cloth, wide flight{{clarification needed|date=January 2018}} and with bands of velvet lining revealing colour at the front edges.

== History ==

The cloak is thought{{by whom|date|date=January 2018}} to originate from the "Sagun", a garment worn by the [[Celtiberians]].

Much later the cloak was banned by one of the ministers of [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]], triggering the start of the [[Esquilache riots]] in the eighteenth century. [[Richard Ford (English writer)|Richard Ford]], in 1845, wrote that the cloak "favours habits of inactivity, prevents the over-zealous arms or elbows from doing anything, conceals a knife and rags, and, when muffled around, offers a disguise for intrigues and robbery", and that this is why it was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Ford|author2=John Murray (Firm)|title=A Hand-book for Travellers in Spain: And Readers at Home : Describing the Country and Cities, the Natives and Their Manners, the Antiquities, Religion, Legends, Fine Arts, Literature, Sports, and Gastronomy : with Notices on Spanish History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNExAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA200|year=1845|publisher=J. Murray|pages=200â}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first cloaks of the nineteenth century came from some of the wool-producing areas such as [[BÃ©jar]] in [[Salamanca]]. It is for this reason that one of its early precursors corresponds to the [[Duke of BÃ©jar]].{{clarification needed|date=January 2018}}

In the nineteenth century the cloak became very popular and thought of as elegant and stylish. Its use decreased around 1900.

The journalist [[Antonio Velasco Zazo]] founded in [[Madrid]] the Association Cloak (called "The Cloak") in 1928, which was devoted entirely to encouraging the Spanish cloak as part of the popular apparel in Madrid. Zazo frequently wore the "castizo Spanish coat", whilst still wearing a hat, a custom among intellectuals. Although the association emerged in Madrid, it was something also typical in the history of Spain, and its prevalence existed in many cities.

== Features ==

The cloak is long, open at the front and sleeveless. It was originally worn by men; models for women began to exist at the end of the 20th century.

The most common colours for the cloak are black, navy blue and brown. It typically includes a fibula (generally similar to those of forms charro button).{{clarification needed|date=January 2018}}.

It is often made of 100% sheep's [[wool]], or 90% wool and 10% [[Cashmere goat|cashmere]]. In the present day it typically includes some amount of [[polyamide]] tissue.

The emboli, the part that covers the face, is almost always 100% cotton [[velvet]] and is dyed in different colours: red, maroon, green.

'''Start Making A Reader Today''' (SMART) is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]], [[Volunteering|volunteer]]-driven tutoring program local to [[Oregon]] for at-risk K-3 readers. SMART was developed by [[Neil Goldschmidt]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;Baker, Scott, Russell Gersten and Thomas Keating. ''[http://getsmartoregon.org/ourmission/documents/Reading%20Research%20Quarterly%20Dec%20%2700.pdf When less may be more: A 2-year longitudinal evaluation of a volunteer tutoring program requiring minimal training]''. Reading Research Quarterly, Volume 35, Number 4; Oct-Dec. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; It has grown from serving 585 children at 8 schools at its inception&lt;ref name="programOverview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Program Overview|publisher=SMART|url=http://getsmartoregon.org/ourmission/documents/Program%20Overview.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to serving 7,244 children at 204 sites in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://getsmartoregon.org/aboutus/documents/SMART%20Annual%20Report%20FY09.pdf Smart Annual Report 2008-2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and 223 sites in 2011.&lt;ref name="oregonian-dec2011"/&gt;  As of December 2011, the organization's annual budget was $2.7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="oregonian-dec2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Row|first=D.K.|title=Getting SMART about success|date=December 16, 2011&lt;!--(online date Dec. 15)--&gt;|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=E1|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/living/index.ssf/2011/12/getting_smart_about_success.html |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program concept involves each student getting one-on-one attention twice a week for 30 minutes as they read to a volunteer to help boost their confidence in their reading ability. Additionally, the students get to take two books home each month over the seven months the program runs each year (mid-October to mid-May), in order to make more reading material available at home.&lt;ref name="oregonian-dec2011"/&gt;

The program's effectiveness is backed by a [[Longitudinal study|two-year study]] performed at the Eugene Research Institute which indicates SMART students outperform similar students in word identification and word comprehension by nearly a half [[standard deviation]].&lt;ref name="study"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://evidencebasedprograms.org/wordpress/?page_id=85 Social Programs That Work: SMART]&lt;/ref&gt;

SMART aims to partner foremost with schools that have a high percentage of children from [[Poverty|low-income]] families. School staff interviews, community support, and information from the [[Oregon Department of Education]] also influence school selection.&lt;ref name="programOverview"/&gt;

In 2010, SMART participated in [[Pepsi]]'s Refresh Challenge and running for the $250,000 prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refresheverything.com/smartreading Pepsi Refresh Challenge: SMART]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Guild''''' is an American [[comedy]] [[web series]] created and written by [[Felicia Day]], who also stars as Cyd Sherman (AKA Codex). It premiered on [[YouTube]] on July 27, 2007 and ran until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grCTXGW3sxQ |title=The Guild: The Guild â Episode 1: Wake-Up Call |website=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=March 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show revolves around the lives of a gamers' [[Clan (computer gaming)|online guild]], The Knights of Good, who play countless hours of a fantasy [[MMORPG]] [[video game]] referred to as ''The Game''. The story focuses on Codex, the guild's [[healer (gaming)|Priestess]], who attempts to lead a normal life after one of her guild-mates, [[Magician (fantasy)|Warlock]] Zaboo ([[Sandeep Parikh]]), shows up on her doorstep.

==History==
''The Guild'' was written and created by Felicia Day, an avid [[gamer]], in between acting roles in several American television shows and movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1260407 |title=Felicia Day |website=[[IMDb]] |accessdate= January 31, 2009 |date=n.d. |last=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years of [[Video game|gaming]], Day decided to make something productive from her experiences and wrote the series as a [[sitcom]] [[television pilot]]. The series was purposely kept generic to avoid copyright problems and to appeal to a wider audience of massively multiplayer online role-playing game ([[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]]) fans, but Day based it on her experience with a ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=JÃ¸n |first=A. AsbjÃ¸rn |date=2010 |title=The Development of MMORPG Culture and The Guild |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283281457_The_Development_of_MMORPG_Culture_and_The_Guild |journal=Australian Folklore: A Yearly Journal of Folklore Studies |volume=25 |pages=97â112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day also hoped to show that the stereotypical man living in his parents' basement is not the only kind of gamer. She decided to produce the series online with Jane Selle Morgan and Kim Evey.&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt; Day already knew Sandeep Parikh and Jeff Lewis from Empty Stage Comedy Theatre, a Los Angeles-based comedy theatre, and their roles were written for them. The rest of the cast was filled through [[audition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wow.com/2007/08/20/interview-with-felicia-day-from-the-guild/|title=Interview with Felicia Day from "The Guild"|last=Holisky |first=Adam |date=August 20, 2007|website=WOW Insider|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://girlsdontgame.com/2007/09/13/interview-with-felicia-day-of-the-guild/ |title=Girls Donât Game Â» Interview with Felicia Day of The Guild |website=Girlsdontgame.com |date=September 13, 2007 |accessdate=March 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711095320/http://girlsdontgame.com/2007/09/13/interview-with-felicia-day-of-the-guild/ |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After filming the first three episodes in two and a half days, they ran out of money. After donations were invited through [[PayPal]], the fourth and fifth episodes were almost solely financed by donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newteevee.com/2007/10/31/the-guild/|title=NewTeeVee Pick: The Guild|last=Wagner |first=James Au|date=October 31, 2007|website=NewTeeVee|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/dec/14/internet-web-series |title=All smiles as web shows come of age |work=The Guardian |date=December 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Each episode opens with Codex ([[Felicia Day]]) recapping the previous events in the story in the form of a [[video blog]]. Usually, it gives the audience a recap of the previous episode and shares Codex's feelings on the subject. The video blogs appear to be outside the timeline, as she is usually wearing an outfit (typically her pyjamas) different from that in the episode itself, though some blogs take place in the time line with other characters or situations interrupting Codex. Each season is divided into 12 episodes (with the exception of season 1, which is divided into 10 episodes).

==Plot==
{{See also|List of The Guild episodes}}

===Season 1 (2007â2008)===
Cyd Sherman struggles to limit her time online, where she games as her alter ego Codex, a member of the '''Knights of Good'''. After the guild realizes that Zaboo has been offline for 39 hours, he appears on Codex's doorstep. Zaboo misunderstood Codex's in-game chats as [[flirting]], and became a stalker living in the same apartment.

On the in-game side, trouble also arises when Bladezz is banned from the game for using a macro (to spam expletives "a few thousand times") in the trade house. Codex uses this as an excuse to have the guild help her with her Zaboo problem. The guild (except Bladezz) reluctantly meets up in personâfor the first timeâat Cheesybeards, a local restaurant, only to find out that Vork had transferred all of their in-game valuables to Bladezz's account as part of a [[team building]] strategy. If they decided to kick out Bladezz, they would lose everything.

Things get worse when Bladezz begins to slander the Knights of Good by showing inappropriate videos of the members' characters, and Codex is no closer to getting Zaboo to go home. Then, Zaboo's home comes to him in the form of his overbearing mother. Zaboo confesses that his mother controls every aspect of his life besides the Internet, which she is beginning to read about. He saw this as his only escape.

Codex comes up with a plan to bring Bladezz down, using Zaboo's stalking skills. Zaboo finds out about Bladezz's modelling career and blackmails him into giving the gold and equipment back to the Guild. The Guild then fights off Zaboo's mom, and Bladezz redeems himself by landing the final blow. Codex soon realizes that she got Zaboo's mother's loot- Zaboo.

===Season 2 (2008â2009)===
Zaboo's mother takes revenge for losing Zaboo by having Codex evicted. Codex and Zaboo move into a new apartment, where Codex meets a new love interest: Wade ([[Fernando Chien]]), a [[stunt man]]. Codex tries to get Zaboo to move out by telling him that he needs to level up before they can be together. She arranges for him to live with Vork, who will take in-game gold as rent, something Zaboo is really good at: [[gold farming|farming]]. Codex focuses on trying to get Wade interested in her.

The Guild finds a valuable in-game orb which Clara and Tink fight over. Just as Vork lets it go up for bid, Clara's children unplug her computer from the Internet and, upon re-connecting, Clara finds out Tink wins it. Clara vows revenge on Vork for giving it to Tink and spends an entire weekend betraying Vork by [[Corpse camping#Online role-playing games|corpse camping]] him on an alternate account as well as searching for her own orb.

Bladezz believes Tink is romantically interested in him and begins to max out his mother's credit cards to buy her stuff, when, in fact, Tink is using him to get what she wants. Vork is annoyed with Zaboo's lack of logic and his antics in trying to 'man-up' for Codex. Codex finds out that the stunt-man has a "stupid tall hot girlfriend," Riley ([[Michele Boyd]]).

The Game announces that the online play will be shut down for maintenance for four hours, during which Vork plans a strategy lecture for Zaboo and Bladezz, while Codex plans a quiet party with Clara and Tink. Bladezz coerces Vork to abandon the lecture in favor of a poker game (offline), hoping to make up some of what he spent on Tink. Clara advertises Codex's party and it becomes a crowded kegger.

Among Clara's random invitees, Wade and Riley come to the party. After finding out that Riley is Wade's roommate and Wade is single, Tink and Clara try to hook Codex up with him. Zaboo, learning of this, persuades Vork and Bladezz to go to Codex's party to try to stop it. Vork discovers that Clara has been attacking him, and begins to question his quality of leadership. Bladezz confronts Tink about their relationship; upon learning that he has been used, Bladezz steals Tink's laptop and deletes her character. Meanwhile, Zaboo walks in on Wade and Codex kissing and challenges Wade to a fight. Wade is a much better fighter, but Zaboo's seriousness about Codex leads to Wade giving up his interest in her. Codex yells at Zaboo that she doesn't like him, and he leaves dejected. Then Codex sees a drunken Clara kissing with Wade, and decides to chase after Zaboo to apologize, but is hurt when she sees him making out with Riley.

===Season 3 (2009)===
Codex was able to recover from the disastrous party by the announcement of the new [[expansion pack]] for the game, ''Spires of Dragonor''. The Knights of Good are first in line at [[GameStop]] until a rival guild, the '''Axis of Anarchy''', cuts in front of them. After the Axis tricks a GameStop worker into sending the Knights to the back of line, Vork, still not over the events of the party, resigns as Guild Leader. Codex is elected as his successor, causing Tink to leave the Knights and join the Axis.

While Vork goes on a self-discovery journey, Clara's husband George demands that she spend more time with the family after discovering her gaming has severely distanced her from him. As a result, Clara proposes that he take Tink's place after auditions for a sixth member fail. Riley, who becomes increasingly domineering to Zaboo, offers to join, but Codex chooses Clara's husband instead, adding "Mr. Wiggly" to the Guild. Meanwhile, Bladezz begins to be targeted by Tink and the Axis of Anarchy, who expose his modelling alias to his school and plant weapons in his locker; later, Bruiser (J. Teddy Garcia), a member of the Anarchists, seduces his mom. Codex issues a message on the game's public forum to stand up against the Axis for the behavior, and in retaliation the Axis puts a bounty on the Guild. Mr. Wiggly unknowingly gives away information about the Guild to other gamers in exchange for loot, which leads to his expulsion from the Guild. With this, he tells Clara to quit the game, and she does to save her marriage.

To end the Axis's harassment of Bladezz, Codex and Zaboo track down the Anarchist Valkyrie at his job, where is he playing the game on company time. After they take away some of his character's possessions and threaten to expose him, Valkyrie tells them where and when the next Axis of Anarchy meeting will take place. Vork returns after regaining his confidence to lead and, with Codex, reassembles the Guild to challenge the Axis at the [[Internet cafÃ©]] where they planned to have a group raid. The battle begins, but both sides lose members quickly. Some of the Knights die in-game when their real-life problems manifest: Clara's husband shows up, angry that she is playing the game; Riley destroys Zaboo's computer for not meeting her demands. Clara tells her husband that they are going to have another child and he forgets about their argument and redeems himself in the eyes of the guild by helping Clara kill the Anarchist Kwan in game. Zaboo breaks up with Riley, who then proceeds to make out with Venom.

Finally, only Codex is left to face off Tink and Axis leader Fawkes ([[Wil Wheaton]]). After Codex makes Bladezz apologize to Tink, Tink decides that the Axis members are even bigger jerks than she can stand and lets Codex kill her in-game. Codex, in a hallucinatory conversation with her game character, musters the courage to defeat Fawkes. The Knights welcome Tink back into the guild, and Bladezz makes tentative peace with the Axis member who seduced his mother. Fawkes invites Codex for drinks; she initially refuses but, in a twist ending, wakes up in bed with him the next morning.

===Season 4 (2010)===
An unexpected and unintentional one-night stand with Fawkes ([[Wil Wheaton]]) causes Codex to stress over what the guild thinks of her and persuades him to cover for her in a pretend relationship. But after spending more time together, Codex realizes he is a "total tool-bag" and reevaluates her criteria for relationships with men. Her computer breaks and she is forced to get a job at Cheesybeards to pay for repairs but has no idea how to fulfil the expectations of her boss, Ollie ([[Frank Ashmore]]).

Zaboo tries to be a good friend to Codex during her fake relationship with Fawkes instead of trying to win her love. He dives into this new pursuit with his usual smothering intensity. When the truth of the relationship is revealed he realizes that his feelings for Codex have changed and he wants to be her friend.

An earnings competition for a new guild hall sparks a real-life business for Tink and Clara that strengthens and strains their friendship.

Vork enlists Zaboo's mother, Avinashi (Viji Nathan), for her "brilliant economic mind" in his pursuit of his vision for the guild's hall and he sets up a stock market and loan company that is bankrupting players. However, her smothering tendencies enrage him to the point that he "make[s] a giant gesture that's really inappropriate" and proposes marriage in an attempt to repulse her. To his horror she accepts.

Codex and Bladezz film an online Cheesybeards commercial but the result is so horrible that it spawns a series of prank calls to the establishment. Ollie is furious and fires Codex. The guild helps Codex get her job back by organizing a celebration at Cheesybeards that attracts a large population of gamers. Bladezz attempts to perform a magic trick involving fire, which ends up torching the restaurant (costing Codex and Bladezz their jobs).

Zaboo begs Codex to intercede in the upcoming nuptials between his mother and Vork. And when Zaboo reveals he has used the money from auctioning a romantic painting of Codex and Fawkes he had commissioned to buy her a new computer she is touched by the gesture and resolves to break up the wedding.

Avinashi and Vork are about to speak their vows to each other, at a virtual wedding ceremony in the newly purchased prison-like Knights of Good guild hall, when all of the guild members object. Codex manages to convince Zaboo's mother that it is wrong to marry "someone [she] can't stand in order to be close to someone who doesn't want to be near [her]". Zaboo helps by suggesting that she visit every few weeks when she gets lonely, causing Codex to realize that he possesses all the qualities on her new litmus test, and consider a relationship with him.

The season wraps up with an official gamemaster crashing the ceremony to put an end to Vork's "Trogothian Stock Market" scheme. Codex convinces the GM, Kevinator ([[Simon Helberg]]), to change the design of the guild hall to the "bitchin' fairy palace" that Tink and Clara wanted. Kevinator is impressed to meet Bladezz, who has become an internet celebrity and invites the whole guild to a gaming convention.

===Season 5 (2011)===
The Knights of Good travel to MegaGameORama-Con, a three-day gaming convention. Bladezz believes that he is invited by Kevinator as a special guest, but his name is not on the invite list. With all nearby hotels booked, Rachel, a member of the convention staff, manages to secure a room for them. However, it is not offered for free, and Bladezz convinces the rest of the guild that he will clarify the situation to Kevinator. Meanwhile, Codex is more interested in getting close to Zaboo, but he becomes engrossed in attending the events and panels.

On the first day of the convention, Bladezz and Vork discover that Kevinator had been fired from The Game before the day of the convention and Bladezz was one of his joke invites. To compensate for hotel fees, both of them start up a photo booth for the Cheeseybeard's pirate. Tink attempts to sell the T-shirts she and Clara made but is forced to find a booth to avoid from being caught by the convention staff for selling without a permit. When she and Clara come upon a [[steampunk]]-themed booth, Clara is more interested in it than selling the shirts. Zaboo is denied entry to a panel because the seats are full, causing him to form a seat-saving network.

Codex tries out the new demo at The Game's booth, but unknowingly insults the creator, Floyd Petrovski (Ted Michaels). She becomes even more preoccupied when Zaboo spurns her advances and is continuously stalked by a convention-goer in a [[fursuit|furry costume]]. When she follows Floyd to apologize, she discovers that he plans to sell The Game to a mainstream market. Codex becomes concerned about the future of the game, which is the only thing in her life holding her friendships together.

Tink, who continuously changes costumes to hide her identity, reveals to Codex at a party that she is hiding from her adoptive family, who have attended the convention, fearing that they will discover her switching majors from pre-med to fashion design. Codex arranges a dinner with her family to reconcile against Tink's will. Meanwhile, Clara tries to join the steampunk group and is trained as their fourth member to help them win the costume contest, but the members of the group ultimately turn her away. Zaboo has become so preoccupied with his seat-saving network that he briefly goes power-hungry. He is stopped by Clara, who brings back his old personality, ending his involvement with the seat-saving network.

Bladezz and Vork's booth becomes successful, but Vork rejects all of the celebrities who want to spend time with Bladezz. His attention, however, is turned towards Madeline ([[Erin Gray]]), an actress who played his favorite character, Charity, on the show ''Time Rings''. The two are invited to a party that night, but Bladezz realizes that all the celebrities lead normal lives, finding them boring. Still, he rejects Rachel and her friends for the celebrities and openly humiliates them. Vork, on the other hand, ends up offending Madeline after he criticizes her decision to leave her show.

The next day, Bladezz has lost all support from the celebrities and his fans, so he is unable to continue the Cheeseybeard pirate's photo booth. Zaboo helps Clara build a steampunk-themed blimp to help her win the costume contest. Codex and Tink discover that Codex's stalker is Fawkes, who wants to join their guild after the Axis of Anarchy broke up, but Codex rejects him. The girls later eavesdrop on Floyd's conversation and discover he plans on revealing his decision at the costume contest that night. Both of them convince the rest of the Guild to help them save The Game from going "freemium". The Guild is able to stop the changes with much success: Clara wins the costume contest, Bladezz is able to win back his fans, and Vork reconciles with Madeline. As all of them leave the convention the next morning, Floyd has decided to give Codex a job.

===Season 6 (2012â2013)===
Codex begins her new job working for Floyd Petrovski at the headquarters for "The Game", only to discover that he's a thoughtless tyrant who immediately turns all the other employees against her. Meanwhile, Tink discovers that the men she manipulated for services and gifts have all slandered her on local websites, losing all of her connections. Bladezz gets kicked out of his house by Bruiser and spends time at Clara's, convincing her long-suffering husband that she is devoted to her children by uploading videos of her parenting to the Internet, though he is more interested in monetizing the videos. Vork, who is dating Madeline, becomes disillusioned when Zaboo uncovers photos of her protesting nude, while Zaboo suffers separation anxiety from the members of the Guild going offline, seeking refuge from a collage of his ideal "sweetheart."

Codex is pressured by her co-workers to convince Floyd to release the underwater expansion pack they have been planning for months but is forced to do menial chores in order to appease him. When the Guild visits her workplace, Tink steals Codex's key to the testing server and initiates a casual relationship with Donovan (Corey Craig), where they agree that he will do chores for her if she spends time with him. Unbeknownst to her, she begins to fall in love with him for real. Zaboo, who enters the server posing as an IT technician, becomes smitten with Sabina ([[Justine Ezarik]]), an [[Non-player character|NPC]] of The Game and the spitting image of his ideal girl.

Vork, who has gotten through with an argument with Madeline about his personal goals, confronts Floyd about his unanswered complaints about The Game. This gets his character permanently banned, and he retaliates by protesting and gaining support from other gamers. Meanwhile, Bladezz is forced to spend time with Wiggly while Clara continues making videos. When Clara becomes Internet-famous, other parents turn to her for advice, one of them being Bladezz's mother. Clara encourages her to keep dating Bruiser, causing Bladezz to convince Wiggly to quit his job.

The underwater expansion patch notes are leaked onto the Internet and wildly rouses the protest. Codex is unsuccessful in finding the culprit but convinces Floyd to release the expansion pack anyway. Donovan reveals to Tink that he was the one who caused the leak in order to push Floyd to release the expansion pack, and Tink tells him that Codex and Vork are in the same guild. He uses this information against Floyd to blame the leak on Codex and gets her fired. Vork's protest culminates in a riot, but his acts have renewed Madeline's faith in him and the two reconcile.

As her final act for Floyd, Codex quells the rioters by questioning their acts and informing that their poor attitudes contributed to the problems at the Game HQ. Floyd unexpectedly steps out and challenges the crowd to insult him to his face instead of typing online insults, but the entire crowd congratulate him on his work and cite their insecurities as part of their bad behaviors. Inspired, Floyd announces a troll-themed add-on for the Game. By the end of the day, Clara is successful in convincing Bruiser to break up with Bladezz's mother and secures a position at a vlogging network, Tink and Donovan begin a relationship, and Zaboo discovers his real-life Sabina. Codex, happy with getting her job back and realizing how much her friends are loyal to her, makes a final vlog and tearily shuts down her computer, bringing the season (and the series) to a close.

}}'''Codex''' (real name Cyd Sherman) is the [[healer (gaming)|Priest]]. Codex is shy and non-confrontational, tending to panic under stress. Outside the game she is a concert violinist (and former [[child prodigy]]), unemployed after setting fire to her boyfriend's cello. She is an addicted gamer who tries at first to control the time she spends online, but fails. For this reason, her therapist drops her. At the beginning of the series she is quite reclusive with no real-life friends; she is often self-conscious and awkward around men. Codex is portrayed by creator [[Felicia Day]].
*'''Zaboo''' (real name Sujan Balakrishnan Goldberg) is the [[Magician (fantasy)|Warlock]]. Zaboo describes himself as a "[[History of the Jews in India|HinJew]]", having a [[Hindu]] mother and [[Jewish]] father. He shows great skill with computers; for example, his [[stalking]] of Codex included obtaining (presumably through the Internet) the [[floor plan]] of her apartment and all her past residences. His obsessive attitude toward Codex reflects his mother's smothering. When talking, Zaboo often uses "-'d" after some key word or expression, self-commenting on what he just said (e.g. bladder'd, testosterone'd). While Zaboo doesn't appear to have a profession, he admits having attended college for four years (to which his mother drove him every day). Zaboo is portrayed by [[Sandeep Parikh]].
*'''Vork''' (real name Herman Holden) is the guild leader and [[Warrior (character class)|Warrior]]. He enjoys managing the guild and budgeting, and believes only in rules and logic. He lives frugally (and illegally) on his late grandfather's [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] checks and is a certified [[notary public]]. When he became Guild Leader he "cut the fats of life" including electric power; he steals his senile neighbor's wifi (and shed), and keeps his food cold by buying ice with [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]]. In the penultimate episode of season 3 he reveals that he can speak fluent [[Korean language|Korean]]; in season 4, he speaks Hindi to Zaboo's mother and claims to know all languages. Vork comes to believe that shared hatred of him is what keeps the guild together. In Season 4, his desire to own a guild hall leads him to manipulating an in-game exchange market, nearly causing him to be banned from the game. Vork is portrayed by [[Jeff Lewis (actor)|Jeff Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1511529 |title=Jeff Lewis (IX) |website=[[IMDb]] |date=n.d.|last=Staff|accessdate=January 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Bladezz''' (real name Simon Kemplar) is the [[thief (character class)|Rogue]]. He is a high school student who spends most of his time outside of school in his mom's garage playing the Game. He is rude to the other male guild members, hits on the female guild members, and often makes lewd sexual jokes and comments. He is shown to be trumped by his tomboyish little sister many times throughout the series. He is worried about being sent to military school, and to save up for college his mom forced him into [[model (person)|modeling]]; using the alias "Finn Smulders" in order to keep it a secret from his fellow high school students. In seasons 4 and 5, he becomes an [[Internet meme]]. Bladezz is portrayed by [[Vincent Caso]].
*'''Clara''' (real name Clara Beane) is the [[Mage (character class)|Frost Mage]]. Clara is a neglectful stay-at-home wife and mother, college partier, and ex-cheerleader. Her three children are all young, with the youngest still [[breastfeeding]]. Though proud of her children, she tends to put gaming before her family, and sometimes tries to mix the two, recruiting her husband "Mr. Wiggly" to the guild. She uses her real name as her avatar name because her kids saw her old name, "Mom-[[Dominatrix|inatrix]]". Clara expresses a ditsy, scatter brained, and eccentric personality with occasional bursts of insight. In the Season 5, Clara proves herself to be a capable mother -figure when she stops Zaboo from going mad with power and lack of sleep. Clara is portrayed by [[Robin Thorsen]].
*'''Tinkerballa''' (real name April Lou) is the [[Ranger (character class)|Ranger]]. Tink distances herself from the guild, trying not to let them know anything about her personal life, she even keeps her real name a secret from her fellow guildies introducing herself as Tinkerballa. Her real name isn't revealed until the fifth season. In reality, Tink is adopted and has two caucasian sisters. She also has been lying to her parents about being a pre-med student, when she has actually switched courses for a degree in costume design. She is shown to have a huge video game addiction, always having an alternate game in hand when not playing the guild's game, even when raiding. She is cold and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], and uses men to get what she wants, including Bladezz who deletes Tink's character to avenge himself after being used by Tink. Following this, and Vork's refusal to punish Bladezz, she leaves the Knights of Good and joins the Axis of Anarchy, but later finds them too "douchey" even for her (she even says that she went on a date with Fawkes to join). She rejoins the Knights of Good during an in-game showdown with the Axis of Anarchy when they call her "Tainterballa" and she allows her avatar to be killed off intentionally to give Codex the shot at victory for the guild. Tink is revealed to be possibly the most social of the group although is incredibly grounded in the online world. In Season 5, Codex reunites Tink with her family at the gaming con. Tink is portrayed by [[Amy Okuda]].

====Temporary members====
*'''Mr. Wiggly''' (real name George Beane) is a [[Ranger (character class)|Hunter]]. He is Clara's husband, nominated by Clara to replace Tink in Season 3; Codex hastily accepts him in order to prevent Zaboo from recruiting Riley. He is clearly inexperienced in gaming, mentioning that the last game he played was ''[[Pong]]'' (which Bladezz was unfamiliar with). Mr. Wiggly wants to spend time with Clara, but is at his wits' end with her distraction and infidelity. George is shown to be a conventional man who has a sense of responsibility, helping Clara when she spontaneously starts a gamer company. He is displeased when Clara leaves unannounced for the gaming con. Mr. Wiggly is played by [[Brett Sheridan]].

===Axis of Anarchy===
*'''Fawkes''' is the leader of the Axis of Anarchy. He always wears a black [[kilt]] and often wears a black "Axis of Anarchy" T-shirt. In person he speaks with a cool, calm, almost polite tone, though he is prone to angered outbursts when online. He seems to be quite educated as well, as he is constantly quoting philosophers, authors, or figures of history. He often demonstrates that he does not believe in following rules, unless it benefits him. Because of their top ranking, he expects constant perfection from his guild. He is also quite full of himself and manipulative, convincing people they are into him. After the Knights of Good defeat the Axis of Anarchy at the end of Season 3, Fawkes invites Codex for drinks and although she doesn't intend to go, she does and ends up having a one-night stand with him. Attempting to justify this to herself and the Guild, she tries seeing where a relationship with Fawkes would go but he claims he is uninterested in dating and eventually she dumps him. However it emerges that Fawkes has developed feelings for Codex and asks her out properly, but she turns him down flatly. He returns in Season 5, revealing that the Axis broke up (claiming no fault of his own). Fawkes is played by [[Wil Wheaton]].
*'''Venom''' is the only woman in her guild, until Tink joins. She is a [[paraplegic]] and uses a wheelchair, but seems to have no problem exploiting her disability for personal gain. She has a violent attitude and seems to dislike her guildmates. On at least two occasions she threatens suicide to get her way, and, when her character is killed in-game, [[sadomasochism|feels ecstasy]] at this vicarious death. She works as a substitute art teacher at Bladezz's high school. Played by [[Teal Sherer]].
*'''Bruiser''' is the guild's healer, and a corrupt [[police officer]]. Bruiser is probably the largest, loudest, and most vulgar member of the Axis. He had sex with Bladezz's mother to torment Bladezz, and in Season 6 is continuing to see her. Played by [[J. Teddy Garces]].
*'''Kwan''' is a champion ''[[StarCraft]]'' player and earns millions playing in [[South Korea]]. He only speaks [[Korean language|Korean]], and has a female assistant named Nik (played by Toni Lee) who massages his hands and translates for him. He seems to be able to understand some English, and it's possible that Fawkes can understand some of what he says (as his translator does not translate what Kwan says into English). Played by Alexander Yi.
*'''Valkyrie''' (alt-character Artemis) is the attempted joker of the guild, though his jokes seem to be funny only to himself. Based on dialogue with his off-screen boss, he works for some form of design or decorating firm&amp;nbsp;â he claimed to be dealing with a client whose [[damask]] came in the wrong color. He also has web skills, claiming to be the one who created finnsmulders.com. He also plays two girl characters because he claims to like looking at girls, although it is strongly implied he might be a [[closeted|closet homosexual]]. Played by Mike Rose.

===Game HQ===
*'''Floyd Petrovski''' is the creator of the Game and head of the company that produces it. While at Megagame-o-ramacon Floyd overhears Codex criticize parts of the upgrades available for playtest at the convention. After Codex apologizes for her comments and gathers the guild together to interfere with the Game's sale to a larger company, Floyd recognizes Codex's passion for the Game, and hires her as an assistant. Floyd proves to be a difficult boss, quickly alienating Codex from much of the staff. Floyd is played by Ted Michaels.
*'''Roy Aquino '''(Derek Basco), the graphic designer of the Game. On Codex's first day, Floyd lets her have Roy's office without his permission, causing Roy to dislike Codex from the very start. He subtly harasses Codex with drawings and bulletins. He is shown to have a stutter when under stress.
*'''Theodora''' (Alexandra Hoover), the Game [[Chief operating officer|COO]] and head producer. Despite being austere and cold-hearted, she is also extremely clumsy and tends to cover this up with awkward recoveries.
*'''Sula Morrison '''(Sujata Day), the hyperactive community coordinator. She wears glasses despite not having any vision impairment, claiming they make her appear smarter.
*'''Donovan''' (Corey Craig), the lead programmer and nephew to Floyd. Despite being handsome and athletic, he avoids people most of the time; Floyd describes him as a [[:wikt:savant|savant]] and Tink questions whether he has [[Asperger's Syndrome]] or not. Tink, nonetheless, gets him into doing her homework and yet develops feelings for him.  He graduated top of his class from [[Caltech]].

===Other characters===
*'''Zaboo's mother''' (Avinashi Goldberg) epitomizes the over-controlling mother. She had Zaboo [[Microchip implant (animal)|microchipped]] to keep track of his movements, punches Codex for (in her belief) trying to take her son away from her, manipulates him through a series of probably false ailments, and gets Codex evicted for helping him break free of her. She returns in Season 4, attempting to develop a real relationship with her son and ends up assisting Vork in earning gold to purchase a deluxe guild hall. She does manage to reconcile with Zaboo. She is played by Viji Nathan.
*'''Dena''' is Bladezz' precocious little sister. She is first seen when she arrives at the table at Cheesybeards, just after Bladezz has informed the Guildies that he is in control of all the Guild gold and equipment, ruining his big exit. Dena often practices playing bass guitar in Bladezz' basement, to his annoyance, and reads [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' (along with building Civil War dioramas). In Season 4, she trained Bladezz in being an actor (calling him terrible). Dena is played by Tara Caso, the sister of [[Vincent Caso]] who plays Bladezz.
*'''Wade Wei''' is Codex's attractive neighbor and brief love interest. Not a gamer himself, Wade works as a [[martial arts]] stunt double; on first meeting Codex, he bumps into her and falls down some stairs, practicing a new stunt. He's fond of showing off his moves and flirting with Codex, making her extremely nervous. Having a queasy stomach, Codex vomits on him upon seeing him in makeup from a zombie movie he is playing in. He harbors a revulsion for gamers, expressing his desire to punch them. Ironically, he describes Codex's gaming-derived knowledge of weaponry as "sexy," though it is worth noting that she does not explain how she knows so much about weapons when he makes the compliment. In episode 10 of season 2, it was revealed that he did [[motion capture]] stunt work for the Game. Wade is played by Fernando Chien.
*'''Riley''' is Wade's [[wikt:friend with benefits|roommate with benefits]] and temporarily dated Zaboo. Riley is an [[First-person shooter|FPS]] gamer and is ranked in [[Halo (series)|Halo]] on [[Xbox Live]]. Riley is very [[BDSM|dominant]] and enjoys submissive underdogs like Zaboo, and later Codex. At first she was thrilled to meet Codex, another girl gamer, until after she learned that Codex was an [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] player, the two began a grudging rivalry. This parodies the normal relationship between [[Multiplayer online game|MOG]] and MMORPG players. In the finale of Season 3, Riley straddles Venom and starts making out with her to get back at Zaboo for breaking up with her. Riley and Venom then start a relationship, which goes well into Season 4 Episode 10, where they're seen discussing Wench outfits. The character of Riley is based off [[Team Unicorn]] member, Rileah Vanderbilt, and played by [[Team Unicorn]] member [[Michele Boyd]].
*'''Ollie''' is the manager of Cheesybeards. He runs his restaurant in a very casual style, allowing Bladezz to use a computer while working at the grill. He speaks entirely in pirate-slang and uses a hook on his left hand (which is hinted to be real). Ollie is responsible for Codex getting a job at the restaurant, after she says she can improve advertising and increase business (though Bladezz sabotages these efforts). Ollie is slightly at odds with Jeannete, who strongly disapproves of Bladezz's slacker work ethic. He first appeared in episode 3 of season 4 and is played by [[Frank Ashmore]].
*'''Jeanette''' is Bladezz's superior at Cheesybeards. She is fed up with his horrible work ethic, but is at odds with Ollie (who is okay with Bladezz). At the end of Season 4, it is revealed she was one of Fawkes' one-night stands and proceeds to beat him up (as she knows [[mixed martial arts]]). Jeanette was the first new character to appear in Season 4 and was played by Tymberlee Hill.
*'''Kevinator''' is the official [[gamemaster]] of the Game who appears at the end of Season 4 to undo Vork ruining the in game economy by hoarding craft items and selling them for massively inflated prices. Kevinator displays a high level of narcissism over his role, proclaiming âI am a god!â before shooting lightning bolts around while giggling manically. After recognising Bladezz from the Cheesy Beards commercial and becoming friends, he provides the Knights of Good with tickets for a gaming convention focused on The Game. However, in Season 5, it is revealed that Kevinator was fired from the game just before the convention for unfair play. In addition, the invite for Bladezz turns out to be a joke, as he has a habit of inviting internet memes for his boss. Kevinator is played by [[Simon Helberg]].
*'''Rachel''' is one of the staff members at Megagame-o-ramacon. She is amazed with meeting Bladezz (barely able to contain her excitement when meeting him), going out of her way to help get the Guild a room. The next day, Rachel is forced to get Tink and Clara to stop selling their shirts (with the help of stormtroopers). After being stood up by Bladezz she and her friends harass him by picketing and wrecking his booth at the convention, though Bladezz does manage to apologize later. She is played by Hayley Holmes.
*'''Madeline Twain''' is a guest of Megagame-o-ramacon, an actress regarded as legendary among the fans of the convention. The former heroine of the long ago cancelled science fiction television series "Time Rings", Madeline serves as mistress of ceremonies at the con's costume contest. Vork, revealed as a former head of the star's fan club, is still smitten with her, though somewhat resentful about her abrupt exit from the series. In Season 6, Vork and Madeline begin dating. Madeline is played by [[Erin Gray]].

==Production notes==

===Season 1===
''The Guild'' was originally intended to be a pilot episode for a TV series, but Felicia Day was advised that it would be much more suited for a web series. The show changed its format and script to fit a web series. The first episode [[List of The Guild episodes#Season 1 (2007â2008)|"Wake-Up Call"]] premiered on YouTube on July 27, 2007. After the first three episodes, the group ran out of money; but a link to Day's [[PayPal]] brought enough donations to fund "Cheesybeards" and "Rather Be Raiding". The first season ended on May 15, 2008, consisting of 10 episodes and two specials (including the Christmas special, "Christmas Raid Carol").

''The Guild'' season 1 DVD was released on [[Amazon.com]] on May 19, 2009. For Canadian audiences, it was bundled with season 2, released on September 29, 2009, also available on Amazon.com.

Season 2 ended with "Fight!" on February 17, 2009, and featured "Love During Wartime" by [[the Main Drag]], as well as visual effects by Doug Luberts.

'''''Time Squad''''' is an American children's animated television series created by [[Dave Wasson]] for [[Cartoon Network]], and the 10th of the network's [[Cartoon Cartoons]]. It follows the adventures of Otto Osworth, Buck Tuddrussel, and the robot Larry 3000, a trio of hapless "time cops" living in the far distant future who [[time travel|travel back in time]] attempting to correct the course of history. During their adventures, they run into major [[historical figure]]s such as [[Julius Caesar]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], and [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]], who have taken a drastically different course of life than history dictates. The mission of the Time Squad is to guide these figures onto the correct path and ensure the integrity of the future.

The series premiered during Cartoon Network's marathon block "Cartoon Cartoon Summer" on June 8, 2001, and ended after two seasons on November 26, 2003, airing 26 episodes in total. In the course of its run, the series received five [[Annie Award]] nominations. Creator Dave Wasson described the series as "a C-student's guide to history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cartoon Net Gives Go to 4 New Shows|first=Paula|last=Bernstein|url=https://variety.com/2001/tv/news/cartoon-net-gives-go-to-4-new-shows-1117794058/|date=February 21, 2001|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the final Cartoon Network original series to premiere during [[Betty Cohen]]'s tenure, as she later resigned due to creative disagreements with [[Jamie Kellner]], then-head of [[Turner Broadcasting System]].

==Overview==
The show is set in the year 100,000,000 AD, on a satellite which orbits Earth. This future Earth is never visited directly, though it is referred in dialogue as a peaceful [[utopia]] where there are no longer any problems to solve. All nations of the world have merged into one, and according to Tuddrussel, there are "no wars, no pollution, and [[bacon]] is good for your [[heart]]".

Despite this cheerful vision of the future, the space station on which the characters live and from which they travel to the past is remarkably [[dystopia|dystopic]]. It features a shooting range, a [[terrarium]] and a prison for repeat offenders, but it is dank, outdated (for the time) and unclean. Mostly this seems to be down to officer Buck Tuddrussel ([[Rob Paulsen]]), a scruffy and immature perennial bachelor, who nevertheless happens to be the station's most senior officer.

The only other official member of Buck's unit is Larry 3000 ([[Mark Hamill]]), a translator robot and former diplomat who was rendered more or less obsolete when all of the world's nations merged. Buck's mindless machismo clashes with Larry's effete sensibilities, and the two bicker terribly. Added to this the fact that neither of them has any great knowledge of history, they made a rather poor team together.

However, when they encounter Otto Osworth ([[Pamela Adlon]]), an 8-year-old boy who happens to be an orphan from the 21st century, he is quickly recruited and added to the team. Otto is shown to be the only one on the team with any enthusiasm or competence for the job. The problem is, neither of the other two are particularly willing to listen to his advice, and he must often resort to trickery to make sure the mission is completed.

The Time Squad organization is set up to ensure that history is maintained and the future protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Eli Whitney's Flesh-Eating Mistake|series=Time Squad|network=Cartoon Network|date=June 8, 2001|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Larry 3000, "time is like a rope", and, as it is woven at one end, ages and gradually unravels and frays at the other. In the context of the show, this often means that historical figures have made different, sometimes [[Anachronism|anachronistic]], choices in life (see [[free will]]), and as such will not be able to fulfill the role that history says they fulfilled (an example of this [[Henry Ford]] did not invent the automobile assembly line due to constant hostility of the [[Dodo Bird|dodo birds]] that never became extinct). According to creator Dave Wasson, "We started by basically knowing what a guy did in history, then found the most outlandish way he could go wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Time Squad' Aims to Rewrite History|first=Bill|last=Keveney|date=June 8, 2001|work=[[USA Today]]|section=Life|page=15E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==

===Main characters===
* {{anchor|Otto Osworth}}Otto Osworth (voiced by [[Pamela Adlon]]): An orphan illegally traveling along with Tuddrussel and Larry, taken on board due to their incompetence and his impressive historical knowledge (and for Otto to escape his brutal life at the orphanage). Despite being a bookworm, his demeanor is far from boring; he is just as childlike and jocular as any regular eight-year-old. Even though he is the youngest, he is also the most responsible out of the squad, being the only one pure enough to not let himself get swayed by temptations. Depending on who he's siding with, he can either become loud and destructive (when Tuddrussel has him company) or composed and calm (when it's Larry he agrees with). It's unknown what happened to Otto's parents.
* {{anchor|Larry 3000}}Lawrence "Larry" 3000 (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]): A grumpy robot and the only one on board able to operate the computer. It's his job to make sure the squad ends up at the right time and place. Initially, he was programmed as a polyglotic robot for diplomatic purposes; when all of the nations rejoiced into one, huge country, his consular abilities were no longer needed. Larry is famous for his effeminate behaviour and interests, which are portrayed all but subtly. Unusually, he is extremely dramatic and open in showing his emotions whilst still being the snarkiest of the trio. He prides himself in having knowledge of proper etiquette and manners. For Otto, he has been repeatedly depicted as a maternal figure.
* {{anchor|Buck Tuddrussel}}Beauregard "Buck" Tuddrussel (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]): An immature time cop, who possesses all the physical requirements for his job and none the intellectual. Whenever there's someone who needs a beating up (and even when they do not), he's the best person to get assigned for such a task. Impulsiveness, aggressiveness and air-headedness are traits which define Tuddrussel quite nicely. Not much of his backstory is known, aside from his Southern heritage and a short-lived marriage to fellow time cop Sheila Sternwell.

===Recurring===
* {{anchor|Sheila Sternwell}}Sheila Sternwell Tudrussel (voiced by Mari Weiss): A lieutenant within Time Squad ranks, Sheila is a no-nonsense woman that takes her job seriously. The ex-wife of Tuddrussel, it's made clear that while she regrets making the mistake of marrying him in the first place, and can be slightly bitter towards him, she does not actually resent him and still does her job and helps out Tuddrussel and his unit when needed. She even seems to go far in not ratting out Tuddrussel and Larry over Otto, and other screw ups that she should be reporting.
* {{anchor|XJ5}}XJ5 (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]): An advanced robot that is more qualified for the job of a time cop than Larry, and he loves to rub it in. Working with Officer Sternwell, XJ5 provides actual help and guidance on missions.
* {{anchor|J.T. Laser}}J.T. Laser (voiced by [[Jim Wise]]): Professional and competent, J.T. is the best officer of what Time Squad has to offer; but he is also an arrogant jerk that gladly makes trouble for Tuddrussel and Larry.
* {{anchor|Lance Nine Trillion}}Lance Nine Trillion (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]): A high-tech robot in Time Squad that provides with the most ranked officer. Lance is the perfect (obnoxious) partner for J.T.
* {{anchor|Sister Thornley}}Sister Thornley (voiced by [[Dee Dee Rescher]]): Otto's former caretaker and nasty [[nun]] of the show before getting "adopted" by Larry and Tuddrussel. Otto had good reason to fear her, as did the other kids that she kept. Obviously not afraid of the police or anyone coming after her, Sister Thornley freely abuses kids that are put into her care, while at the orphanage and even more disturbingly in public. Her motives are despairingly questionable, such making the children work under horrific conditions in order to make a quick buck, or why she had a problem with Otto reading books (or any child reading, for that matter. She apparently had an entire policy against it). At the end, Larry and Tuddrussel officially takes Otto much to her dismay, but to her joy she finds another genius child she could abuse.

|ShortSummary=While on a mission to 2002 to have George W. Bush forget about building the world's biggest ball of twine, Otto is taken back to the orphanage from which he came (as seen in the first episode) by Sister Thornley. Without Otto, Larry and Tuddrussel must once again try to complete a historical mission (this time centered on [[Christopher Columbus]]) on their own, but when that fails, they scour many orphans from the past to find a replacement boy genius. However when they realize that no one could replace Otto, Larry and Tuddrussel go back to the orphanage to rescue him from Sister Thornley. In the process, they abandon a kid they got from another orphanage, whom Sister Thornley takes advantage of.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2821">[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.1203 Grave Marker Tumba (3).jpg|thumbnail|Tumba, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]

The [[Kongo people|Kongo]] place stone figures called '''tumba''' (a [[Kongo language|Ki-Kongo]] word, pl. bitumba) on the graves of powerful people. Bitumba were created in [[Zaire]] and [[Angola]] during the nineteenth century and the first part of the twentieth. The term tumba comes from the old [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word for âtombââ this genre may have been inspired by grave monuments for European merchants and missionaries in [[Kongo Kingdom|Kongo]] cemeteries.

==Materials and Dimensions==
Bituma were executed in soft stone. Their average height it close to 50 centimeters; the smallest bituma measure between 15 and 20 centimeters and the largest are approximately a meter in height.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert Farris|title=The four moments of the sun : Kongo art in two worlds|year=1981|publisher=National Gallery of Art|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=089468003X|author2=Cornet, Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
Artist Robert Verly gathered a large number of statues in the north of Angola near the Zaire border and, in the May 1955 issue of Zaire, he classified the objects by type and proposed an explanation for their use.&lt;ref name="Verly 1955"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verly|first=Robert|title=La Statuaire de pierre du Bas-Congo (Bamboma-Musurongo)|journal=Zaire|year=1955|volume=5|location=Brussels}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1978, the Institut des Musees Nationaux du [[Zaire]] at the Center for International Commerce of Zaire in [[Kinshasa]] mounted an exhibition of 72 bitumba called "Sculptures Stones from Lower Zaire."&lt;ref name="Cornet 1978"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornet|first=Joseph|title=Pierres sculptees du Bas-Zaire|year=1978|location=Kinshasa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles and Themes==
Bitumba sculptures are unique in their variety of styles. Robert Farris Thompson has identified about twenty workshops that explain stylistic individuality. The wide dispersal of the works, however, has made it impossible to localize their centers of production. 

Bitumba are express a variety of themes. The most widely found - about twenty percent of statues belong to this type - is a figure who raises his hands in front of his face in a gesture often interpreted as praying. The second most prevalent theme is that of mother and child. The art of Lower Zaire, and especially the art of [[Mayombe]], is known for privileging [[maternity]] subjects. The third theme is that of the "thinker," who holds on hand on the hip and the other pressed to check in an attitude of meditation.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1981" /&gt;

Various sources attributed this to ''yadaya'' practices.]]
'''Yadaya''' ({{lang-my|ááá¼á¬}}, {{IPA-my|jÉÌdÉjÃ |IPA}}; from [[Sanskrit]] {{IAST|[[Yantra|yÄtra]]}}; variously spelt '''yadayar''' and '''yedaya''') refers to magical rituals done to delay, neutralize or prevent misfortune, widely practiced in [[Burma]] (Myanmar). These rituals, which originate from [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]], are guided and prescribed by soothsayers and astrologers, who use a combination of mathematical equations and astrology to formulate a "prescription" to avert misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree=M.A |chapter= |title=Arakan, Min Yazagyi and the Portuguese |url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/6120/1/22Charney1993thesis.pdf |author= |last=Charney |first=Michael W. |year=1993 |publisher=SOAS |accessdate=2010-09-15 |docket= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Burmese leaders, including [[U Nu]], [[Ne Win]] and [[Than Shwe]] and many government policy decisions are widely understood to have been influenced by yadaya rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Matthews |first1=Bruce |year=1998 |title=The Present Fortune of Tradition-Bound Authoritarianism in Myanmar |journal=Pacific Affairs |publisher=University of British Columbia |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=19â20 |doi= |jstor=2760820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Instant karma in Myanmar |authors=Sudha Ramachandran, Swe Win  |newspaper=Asia Times |date=2009-06-18 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KF18Ae02.html |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[Buddhism in Burma|Burmese Buddhists]], yadaya is often linked to merit-making, as some prescriptive rituals involve seemingly "Buddhist" acts, although they are done to bypass [[karma|karmic fate]], which cannot be altered by ritual in Buddhist doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Matthews |first1=Bruce |year=1999 |title= Burma/Myanmar|journal=The Round Table |publisher=Routledge |volume=88 |issue=349 |pages=78â79 |url=http://pdfserve.informaworld.com/327910_918974314_750459818.pdf |doi=10.1080/003585399108289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yadaya is closely associated to [[numerology]], particularly the number nine, which is widely believed to be an auspicious number. Some scholars contend that yadaya originates to the [[Pagan dynasty|Pagan period]], first practiced by monks of the [[Ari Buddhism|Ari sect]], a form of Buddhism that predates the introduction of [[Theravada Buddhism]] in Burma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pagoda Power |author=Arkar Moe |newspaper=The Irrawaddy |date=July 2009 |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=16222&amp;page=2 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable form of yadaya is the construction of pagodas, as seen in the construction of 60,000 pagodas by [[U Nu]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="see"&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical dictionary of Burma (Myanmar) |last=Seekins |first=Donald M. |year=2006 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-8108-5476-5 |page=483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government's unexplained decision to change the road traffic in 1970 to [[Right- and left-hand traffic|right-hand traffic]] (even though the overwhelming majority of Burmese cars are made for left-hand traffic) is one such incident believed to be the result of yadaya, to avert the threat of a political attack from the right and insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Burma Makes Road Switch | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/07/archives/burma-makes-road-switch.html | work=The New York Times | date=7 December 1970 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}, ''[[New York Times]]'', 07 Dec 1970, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Living silence: Burma under military rule |last=Fink |first=Christina |year=2001 |publisher=Zed Books |isbn=978-1-85649-926-2 |page=41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the unusual clothing choices, namely the wearing of traditional female ''acheik''-patterned [[longyi]] (sarongs) by [[Than Shwe]] and other military generals at recent public appearances, including Union Day celebrations in February 2011 and at the reception of the Lao Prime Minister [[Bouasone Bouphavanh]] in June 2011 have also been attributed to yadaya, as a way to divert power to neutralize [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]'s power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Did Burma's Leader Appear on TV in Women's Clothes? |first=Robert |last=Horn |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2053563,00.html |newspaper=TIME |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Than Shwe Skirts the Issue |author=WAI MOE |url=http://www.irrawaddymedia.com/opinion_story.php?art_id=20782 |newspaper=The Irrawaddy |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=8 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314131826/http://www.irrawaddymedia.com/opinion_story.php?art_id=20782|archivedate=2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Youth Art Month Logo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Logo]] of Youth Art Month.]]
'''Youth Art Month''' is a month of promoting art and [[art education]] in the United States.  It is observed in March, with thousands of American schools participating, often with the involvement of local [[art museums]] and [[civic organizations]].

==Background==
Youth Art Month was founded by the Crayon, Water Color &amp; Craft Institute, Inc., the predecessor of the [[Art &amp; Creative Materials Institute, Inc.]] (ACMI), in cooperation with the [[National Art Education Association]], in 1961 and was initially called '''Children's Art Month'''.  Its goal was to "emphasize the value of participating in art for all children."  It was renamed Youth Art Month in 1969, to include secondary school students.  In 1984, ACMI created the [[Council for Art Education, Inc.]] (CFAE) to oversee the annual observation of Youth Art Month.  As of 2009, CFAE consisted of representatives of: ACMI, the [[National Art Education Association]], "The SHIP" (a group of [[manufacturers]] of [[art materials]]), and the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]].  The [[Craft &amp; Hobby Association]] is also involved in Youth Art Month.

==Activities==

===National events===

The main nationwide component of Youth Art Month is a [[competition]] called '''School Flags Across America . . . Flying High'''.  As part of the competition, each state Youth Art Month Chairperson selects a theme that is representative of that state and of the spirit of Youth Art Month, and students design flags around that theme.  The winning design from each state is then made into an actual flag, and the 50 student-designed flags are then displayed throughout Washington, D.C. following an [[opening ceremony]] held the first week of March to commemorate the start of Youth Art Month.  The winning students and their families are invited to attend this opening ceremony in Washington, D.C. and the flags are displayed throughout the city for March, and then displayed at the Youth Art Month booth at the annual [[Convention (meeting)|convention]] of the National Art Education Association.

===State and local events===
[[Governor (United States)|Governors]] and [[mayors]] throughout the United States issue proclamations declaring March as Youth Art Month, and many [[United States Senate|United States Senators]], [[Member of Congress]], and [[State legislature (United States)|state legislators]] take the opportunity to make public statements in favor of art education.

Observation of Youth Art Month is carried out by [[volunteering|volunteers]] around the country, including art educators, [[parents]], librarians, leaders of [[youth organizations]], [[businesspeople]], and students.

Activities depend on the efforts of local volunteers, and include:

* display of student art at art museums, [[libraries]], and other places throughout the community;
* talks, forums, and discussions on art;
* partnerships with local newspapers, radio stations, and TV stations to raise the profile of youth art and art education in the community;
* local art competitions, often with winning student art displayed somewhere prominent in the community (e.g. at local bus stops);
* cross-promotions to raise awareness of other local charities or to beautify the community;
* special events, such as [[sidewalk chalk]] displays, [[ice sculpture]] carving, and craft workshops.
