      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3261">{{Nihongo|'''''Animerama'''''|アニメラマ|lead=yes}} is a series of thematically-related [[Adult animation|adult]] [[anime]] [[feature film]]s originally conceived and initiated by [[Osamu Tezuka]] and made at his [[Mushi Production]] animation studio from the late 1960s to early 1970s, perhaps intended as animated counterparts to the then-emergent [[pink film]]s (a direct connection being Shigemi Satoyoshi as the scenarist for ''Cleopatra'').

As well as the erotic themes, they are also defined by mixing more typical [[traditional animation]] with sequences of [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] and [[Yōji Kuri]]–influenced experimental use of modern design, limited animation, and still paintings akin to Tezuka's experimental [[short film]]s and like those largely were all directed, sometimes sharing the billing with Tezuka, by [[Eiichi Yamamoto]]. The first, ''[[One Thousand and One Arabian Nights (film)|A Thousand &amp; One Nights]]'', was the first erotic animated feature film and, at 130 minutes, remains one of the longest ever animated films. The first two are also notable for having [[Film score|score]]s by famed composer and electronic rearranger [[Isao Tomita]]. The third, ''Belladonna'', made without Tezuka's direct involvement, is more serious than its predecessors and more avant-garde still, telling its story largely through pans over still, [[panoramic painting]]s with narration.

The three films in the trilogy are:

* {{Nihongo|''[[A Thousand and One Nights (1969 film)|A Thousand and One Nights]]''|千夜一夜物語|Senya Ichiya Monogatari}} (1969)
* {{Nihongo|''[[Cleopatra (1970 film)|Cleopatra]]''|クレオパトラ|Kureopatora}} (1970)
* {{Nihongo|''[[Belladonna of Sadness]]''|哀しみのベラドンナ|Kanashimi no Beradonna}} (1973)
All three were released onto [[DVD-Video]] by the video division of [[Columbia Music Entertainment]], both separately and as a box set, in 2004 in Japan and re-released in 2006.

A 1991 [[original video animation]] based on part of [[Ihara Saikaku]]'s ''The Life of an Amorous Man'' (released on [[VHS]] in the United Kingdom and Ireland as ''[[The Sensualist]]'') made at Grouper Production is sometimes considered an unofficial successor to the trilogy, owing to the involvement of Yamamoto as [[screenwriter]] and its similarly both erotic and experimental imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Benjamin |first=Ettinger |title=The Sensualist |url=http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php?title=the_sensualist&amp;c=1 |publisher=AniPages Daily |accessdate=11 September 2010 |date=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Archi-writing'''" ({{lang-fr|archi-écriture}}) is a term used by French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] in his attempt to re-orient the relationship between speech and writing. 

Derrida argued that as far back as [[Plato]], speech had been always given priority over writing. In the West, phonetic writing was considered as a secondary imitation of speech, a poor copy of the immediate living act of speech. Derrida argued that in later centuries philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] both gave writing a secondary or parasitic role. In Derrida's essay ''Plato's Pharmacy'', he sought to question this prioritising by firstly complicating the two terms speech and writing.

According to Derrida, this complication is visible in the Greek word φάρμακον ''pharmakon'', which meant both "cure" and "poison". Derrida noted that Plato argued that writing was "poisonous" to memory, since writing is a mere repetition, as compared to the living memory required for speech. Derrida points out however, that since both speech and writing rely upon repetition they cannot be completely distinguished.

In the [[neologism]] ''archi-writing'', "archi-" meaning "origin, principle, or [[wikt:telos|telos]]", attempts to go beyond the simple division of writing/speech. Archi-writing refers to a kind of writing that precedes both speech and writing. Derrida argued that archi-writing is, in a sense, language, in that it is already there before we use it, it already has a pregiven, yet malleable, structure/genesis, which is a semi-fixed set-up of different words and syntax. This ''fixedness'' is the writing to which Derrida refers, just such a 'writing' can even be seen in cultures that do not employ ''writing'', it could be seen in notches on a rope or barrel, fixed customs, or placements around the living areas.

==Criticism==

Philosopher [[John R. Searle]] argued that most of Derrida's concepts were characterized by a "breathtaking implausibility", being based on an "eccentric reading of the history of Western philosophy", which overlooks or misstates many important details of philosophy and language (e.g., Derrida distorts Saussure's [[structural linguistics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John R. (1983) "The Word Turned Upside Down", ''The New York Review of Books'', Volume 30, Number 16, October 27, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
The series consists of two story arcs "Honour Among Punks" written by Reed and Davis and "Children of the Night" written by Davis alone, who also provided the bulk of the art (with some early fill-in inking).

==Plot==

It features an alternative [[Sherlock Holmes]] world where the values and class system of [[Victorian era]] England carried over into a late 20th Century where [[World War II]] never occurred. The story mainly concerns a group of [[Punk subculture|punks]] attempting to solve a series of murders reminiscent of the [[Jack the Ripper]] killings of the late 19th century.

==Collected editions==

Ten issues were published and collected in two [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]] (one for each story arc) by Caliber:

*''Honour Among Punks'' (collects ''Baker Street'' #1-5, 175 pages, 1993, {{ISBN|0-941613-42-9}})
*''Children of the Night'' (collects ''Baker Street'' #6-10, 178 pages, 1993, {{ISBN|0-941613-43-7}})

and then as a single volume:

*''Honour Among Punks'' (iBooks, 352 pages, 2003, paperback, {{ISBN|0-7434-5904-0}}, hardcover, {{ISBN|0-7434-7993-9}})

In the arts, '''bricolage''' ([[French language|French]] for "[[DIY]]" or "do-it-yourself projects") is the construction or creation of a work from a diverse range of things that happen to be available, or a work created by mixed media.

The term ''bricolage'' has also been used in many other fields, including [[anthropology]], philosophy, critical theory, education, computer software, and business.

==Origin==
''Bricolage'' is a French [[loanword]] that means the process of [[improvisation]] in a human endeavor. The word is derived from the French verb ''bricoler'' ("to tinker"), with the English term [[DIY]] ("Do-it-yourself") being the closest equivalent of the contemporary French usage. In both languages, ''bricolage'' also denotes any works or products of DIY endeavors.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms |last= Baldick |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Baldick |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn= 9780199208272 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=dictionary%20of&amp;pg=PA42 |accessdate=29 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Broady&gt;{{Cite book |title=Colloquial French 2: The Next step in Language Learning |last=Broady |first=Elspeth |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-26647-5 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JM2AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The arts==

===Music===
Instrumental bricolage in music includes the use of [[found object]]s as instruments, such as:

*[[Spoon (musical instrument)|Spoons]]
*[[Musical saw]]
*Australasian [[Slapping (music)|slap bass]] made from a [[tea chest]]
*Comb and wax paper for [[humming]] through
*[[eucalyptus|Gumleaf]] humming
*[[Lagerphone]] (made from a stick and bottle tops)
*[[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] [[steelpan|steel drums]] (made from [[drum (container)|industrial storage drums]])
*[[African drums]] and [[thumb piano]]s made from recycled pots and pans.
*American super instruments made from recorders and bicycle bells or metal rods and keys
*[[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp dancing]] is an example of the use of bricolage in music and dance, utilizing everyday objects, such as trash cans and broom sticks, to produce music.
*Many of the musical instruments created by American composer [[Harry Partch]] utilize unusual items, such as automotive [[hubcap]]s and [[pyrex]] [[carboy]]s.

Stylistic bricolage is the inclusion of common musical devices with new uses.  Shuker writes, "Punk best emphasized such stylistic bricolage".&lt;ref&gt;Shuker ''Popular Music: Key Concepts'' 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical bricolage flourishes in music of sub-cultures where: 
*experimentation is part of daily life (pioneers, immigrants, artistic communities),
*access to resources is limited (such as in remote, discriminated or financially disconnected sub-cultures) which limits commercial influence (e.g. acoustic performers, ghetto music, hippie, folk or traditional musicians), and
*there is a political or social drive to seek individuality (e.g. rap music, peace-drives, drummers' circles)

Unlike other bricolage fields, the intimate knowledge of resources is not necessary. Many punk musicians, for instance, are not musically trained, because they believe training can discourage creativity in preference for accuracy. Also, careful observation and listening is not necessary, it is common in spontaneous music to welcome 'errors' and disharmony. Like other bricolage fields, bricolage music still values trusting one's ideas and self-correcting structures such as targeted audiences.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Visual art===
In art, bricolage is a technique or creative mode, where works are constructed from various materials available or on hand, and is seen as a characteristic of many [[postmodern]] works.

These materials may be [[mass-produced]] or "junk". See also: [[Kurt Schwitters|Merz]], [[polystylism]], [[collage]], [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]].

Bricolage can also be applied to [[Improvisational theatre|theatrical forms of improvisation]], where the main strategy is to use the environment and materials at hand. The environment is the stage and the materials are often pantomimed. The use of the stage and the imaginary materials are all made up on the spot, so the materials which are at hand are actually things that the players know from past experiences (i.e. an improvisation of ordering fast food: One player would start with the common phrase "How may I help you?").

Bricolage is also applied in [[interior design]], through blending styles and accessorizing spaces with what is "on hand". Many designers use bricolage to come up with innovative and unique ideas.

===Architecture===
Bricolage is considered the jumbled effect produced by the close proximity of buildings from different periods and in different architectural styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bricolage |title=bricolage - definition of bricolage by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a term that is admiringly applied to the architectural work of [[Le Corbusier]], by Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter in their book ''Collage City'', suggesting that he assembled ideas from found objects of the [[history of architecture]]. This, in contrast to someone like [[Mies Van der Rohe]], whom they called a "hedgehog", for being overly focused on a narrow concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Academics==

===Literature===
In literature, bricolage is affected by [[intertextuality]], the shaping of a text's meanings by reference to other texts.

===Cultural studies===
In [[cultural studies]] bricolage is used to mean the processes by which people acquire objects from across [[social division]]s to create new [[cultural identity|cultural identities]]. In particular, it is a feature of [[subculture]]s such as the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement. Here, objects that possess one meaning (or no meaning) in the dominant culture are acquired and given a new, often subversive meaning. For example, the [[safety pin]] became a form of decoration in punk culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hebdige, Dick. ''Subculture: the Meaning of Style.'' London: Routledge, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social psychology&lt;!--linked from 'Claude Lévi-Strauss'--&gt;===
The term "psychological bricolage" is used to explain the mental processes through which an individual develops novel solutions to problems by making use of previously unrelated knowledge or ideas they already possess. 
The term, introduced by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, Matthew J. Karlesky and Fiona Lee&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Karlesky, M., &amp; Lee, F. (in press). Psychological Bricolage and the Creative Process. In C. Shalley, M. Hitt, and J. Zhou (Eds.), Oxford Handbook of Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOEwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=oxford+creativity+bricolage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9YO2B5AYJD&amp;sig=fUzbuH-bEH_OB4D3iaqMu-DbRjk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J3MgVbe9KcjosAXC1oGABw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=oxford%20creativity%20bricolage&amp;f=false] of the [[University of Michigan]], draws from two separate disciplines.  The first, “social bricolage,” was introduced by cultural anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] in 1962. Lévi-Strauss was interested in how societies create novel solutions by using resources that already exist in the collective social consciousness. The second, "creative cognition,” is an intra-psychic approach to studying how individuals retrieve and recombine knowledge in new ways.  Psychological bricolage, therefore, refers to the cognitive processes that enable individuals to retrieve and recombine previously unrelated knowledge they already possess.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Karlesky, M., &amp; Lee, F. "Psychological Bricolage, Integrating social identities to produce creative solutions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Shalley, M. Hitt, &amp; J. Zhou. Oxford Handbook of Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship.&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychological bricolage is an intra-individual process akin to [[Karl E. Weick]]’s notion of bricolage in organizations, which is akin to Lévi-Strauss' notion of bricolage in societies.&lt;ref name="organizational1"&gt;Karl Weick, "Organizational Redesign as Improvisation", reprinted in ''Making Sense of the Organization''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
In his book ''[[The Savage Mind]]'' (1962, English translation 1966), French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] used  "bricolage" to describe the characteristic patterns of mythological thought. In his description it is opposed to the engineers' creative thinking, which proceeds from goals to means. Mythical thought, according to Lévi-Strauss, attempts to re-use available materials in order to solve new problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Claude |last=Lévi-Strauss |title=La Pensée sauvage |location=Paris |year=1962 }} English translation as ''The Savage Mind'' (Chicago, 1966). {{ISBN|0-226-47484-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tesugen.com/archives/03/08/bricolage |title=Bricolage [Tesugen&amp;#93; |publisher=Tesugen.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035434/http://tesugen.com/archives/03/08/bricolage |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varenne.tc.columbia.edu/bib/info/levstcld066savamind.html |title=Varenne: quotes from Lévi-Strauss (1963 [1962&amp;#93;) |publisher=Varenne.tc.columbia.edu |date=1999-05-11 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Derrida]] extends this notion to any discourse. "If one calls ''bricolage'' the necessity of borrowing one's concept from the text of a heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined, it must be said that every discourse is ''bricoleur''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacques |last=Derrida |authorlink=Jacques Derrida |url=http://hydra.humanities.uci.edu/derrida/sign-play.html |title=Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences |publisher=Hydra.humanities.uci.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], in their 1972 book ''[[Anti-Œdipus|Anti-Oedipus]]'', identify ''bricolage'' as the characteristic [[mode of production]] of the schizophrenic producer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], ''[[Anti-Œdipus|Anti-Oedipus]]: Capitalism and Schizophrenia''. Trans. Robert Hurley, Mark Seem, and Helen R. Lane. Continuum edition. London: Continuum, 2004 (1972). p.7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In the discussion of [[Constructionism_(learning_theory)|constructionism]], [[Seymour Papert]] discusses two styles of solving problems. Contrary to the analytical style of solving problems, he describes bricolage as a way to learn and solve problems by trying, testing, playing around.

[[Joe L. Kincheloe]] and [[Shirley R. Steinberg]] have used the term bricolage in educational research to denote the use of multiperspectival research methods. In Kincheloe's conception of the research bricolage, diverse theoretical traditions are employed in a broader critical theoretical/critical pedagogical context to lay the foundation for a transformative mode of multimethodological inquiry. Using these multiple frameworks and methodologies, researchers are empowered to produce more rigorous and praxiological insights into socio-political and educational phenomena.

Kincheloe and Steinberg theorize a critical multilogical epistemology and critical connected ontology to ground the research bricolage. These philosophical notions provide the research bricolage with a sophisticated understanding of the complexity of knowledge production and the interrelated complexity of both researcher positionality and phenomena in the world. Such complexity demands a more rigorous mode of research that is capable of dealing with the complications of socio-educational experience. Such a critical form of rigor avoids the reductionism of many monological, mimetic research orientations (see Kincheloe, 2001, 2005; Kincheloe &amp; Berry, 2004; Steinberg, 2015; Kincheloe, McLaren, &amp; Steinberg, 2012).

==Information technology==

===Information systems===
In [[information systems]], bricolage is used by [[Claudio Ciborra]] to describe the way in which [[strategic information system]]s (SIS) can be built in order to maintain successful [[competitive advantage]] over a longer period of time than standard SIS. By valuing tinkering and allowing SIS to evolve from the bottom-up, rather than implementing it from the top-down, the firm will end up with something that is deeply rooted in the [[organisational culture]] that is specific to that firm and is much less easily imitated.&lt;ref&gt;Ciborra, Claudio (1992). "From Thinking to Tinkering: The Grassroots of Strategic Information Systems", ''The Information Society'' 8, 297–309&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
In her book ''[[Life on the Screen]]'' (1995), [[Sherry Turkle]] discusses the concept of bricolage as it applies to problem solving in code projects and workspace productivity.  She advocates the "bricoleur style" of programming as a valid and underexamined alternative to what she describes as the conventional structured "planner" approach.  In this style of coding, the programmer works without an exhaustive preliminary specification, opting instead for a step-by-step growth and re-evaluation process.  In her essay "Epistemological Pluralism", Turkle writes: "The bricoleur resembles the painter who stands back between brushstrokes, looks at the canvas, and only after this contemplation, decides what to do next."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Turkle |first=Sherry |url=http://www.papert.org/articles/EpistemologicalPluralism.html |title=Epistemological Pluralism |publisher=Papert.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==
The visual arts is a field in which individuals often integrate a variety of knowledge sets in order to produce inventive work. To reach this stage, artists read print materials across a wide array of disciplines, as well as information from their own social identities.&lt;ref&gt;Cobbledick, Susie. "Information-Seeking Behavior of Artists: Exploratory Interviews."&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the artist [[Shirin Neshat]] has integrated her identities as an Iranian exile and a woman in order to make complex, creative and critical bodies of work.&lt;ref&gt;2010 TED Talk, "Shirin Neshat: Art in Exile."&lt;/ref&gt; This willingness to integrate diverse knowledge sets enables artists with multiple identities to fully leverage their knowledge sets. This is demonstrated by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, Chi-Ying Chen and Fiona Lee, who found that individuals were shown to exhibit greater levels of innovation in tasks related to their cultural identities when they successfully integrated those identities.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Cheng, C. &amp; Lee, F. "Increasing Innovation Through Identity Integration."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
[[Karl Weick]] identifies the following requirements for successful bricolage in organizations.&lt;ref name="organizational1"/&gt;
 
*Intimate knowledge of resources
*Careful observation and listening
*Trusting one's ideas
*Self-correcting structures, with feedback

Nasim Nicholas Taleb mentions it in his book ''[[Antifragile]]''.

==In popular culture==

===Fashion===
In his essay "Subculture: The Meaning of Style", [[Dick Hebdige]] discusses how an individual can be identified as a bricoleur when they "appropriated another range of commodities by placing them in a symbolic ensemble which served to erase or subvert their original straight meanings".&lt;ref&gt;"Subculture: The Meaning of Style". Dick Hebdige. In ''Cultural Studies: An Anthology''. Ed. Michael Ryan. 2008. p. 592&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion industry uses bricolage-like styles by incorporating items typically utilized for other purposes. For example, candy wrappers are woven together to produce a purse. The movie ''[[Zoolander]]'' parodies this concept with "Derelicte", a line of clothing made from trash.

===Television===
* ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' is a television series in which the protagonist is the paragon of a bricoleur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ian |last=Bogost |title=Comparative Video Game Criticism |url=http://gac.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/1/41 |work= [[Games and Culture]] |volume= 1, No. 1 |pages=41–46 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating solutions for the problem to be solved out of immediately available found objects.

From the 1840s to the 1870s the great demand for buffalo robes in the commercial centres of Montreal, New York, St. Paul and St. Louis was a major factor that led to the near extinction of the species. The robes were used as blankets and padding in carriages and sleighs and were made into [[Buffalo coat]]s.&lt;ref name="Welsted1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Welsted|title=The Geography of Manitoba: Its Land and Its People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQKLCbdJ0GQC&amp;pg=PA90|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Univ. of Manitoba Press|isbn=978-0-88755-375-2|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only hides taken in winter between November and March when the furs are in their prime were suitable for buffalo robes.&lt;ref name="Waterston1863"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Waterston|title=A Cyclopaedia of Commerce, Mercantile Law, Finance, Commercial Geography, and Navigation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5lKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA143|year=1863|publisher=H.G. Bohn|pages=142–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The summer hides were used to make coverings for [[tipis]] and [[Moccasin|moccasins]] and had little value to traders.&lt;ref name="Welsted1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waterston1863"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9068">'''Burmese Buddhist titles''' (သာသနာတော်ဆိုင်ရာ ဘွဲ့တံဆိပ်တော်များ) encompass numerous honorific titles conferred by the Burmese government, to recognize members of the [[Sangha]] as well as civilians. These religious titles are conferred annually by the Burmese government, in a special ceremony during the full moon day of [[Tabaung]], at the [[Uppatasanti Pagoda]] in [[Naypyidaw]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Traditions of Buddhist Practice in Burma|last=Houtman|first=Gustaaf|date=|publisher=School of Oriental and African Studies, London University|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=277–278|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1988 to 2008, the ceremony was held at the Mahāpāsaṇa Cave, near [[Kaba Aye Pagoda]] in [[Yangon]].

== History ==
In the pre-colonial era, the Burmese monarchy recognized [[Buddhist monks]] and laypersons by bestowing [[religious titles]] composed of [[Pali]] and native [[Burmese language|Burmese]] styles. [[Sayadaw]] (ဆရာတော်), which literally means "teacher of royalty," was originally bestowed to monks who had educated the king as monastic teachers or tutors, although its usage grew more commonplace with time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Pagan era ===
During the [[Pagan Kingdom]], several kings awarded religious titles to prominent Buddhist monks.

=== Konbaung era ===
During the [[Konbaung Dynasty]], distinguished monks received a suffixed title in the form of Rājaguru (ရာဇဂုရု) or Rājādhirājaguru (ရာဇာဓိရာဇဂုရု).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The reign of [[Mindon Min]] also saw a liberalization in the usage of Sayadaw as a title, which became widely conferred to accomplished monks, regardless of whether they had personally educated the king.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nowadays, Sayadaw is routinely used as a title for all senior monks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Colonial era ===
From 1915 to 1942, the British colonial government conferred the title Aggamahāpaṇḍita (အဂ္ဂမဟာပဏ္ဍိတ) to 98 monks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Post-independence era ===
In 1948, Burma achieved independence from Great Britain. From 1951 through 1953, the Burmese government awarded the Aggamahāpaṇḍita title to 15 monks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From March to July 1953, the government convened a special committee to establish a new system of religious titles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The new system, which included titles for monks and civilians, was introduced on 28 July 1953:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Clerical religious titles
## Aggamahāpaṇḍita
## Abhidhajamahāraṭṭhaguru (အဘိဓဇမဟာရဋ္ဌဂုရု) 
# Civilian religious titles
## Pyinna Kyaw (ပညာကျော်)
## Paññābala (ပညာဗလ)
## Mahāpaññābala (မဟာပညာဗလ)
Following the [[Sixth Buddhist council]] and introduction of the [[Monastic examinations|Tipiṭakadhara examinations]], a new series of titles recognizing academic merit, was introduced by the government. [[Mingun Sayadaw]], in 1953, became the first recipient of the newly minted Tipiṭakadhara Dhammabhaṇḍāgārika (တိပိဋကဓရ ဓမ္မဘဏ္ဍာဂါရိက) title.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ue56vcBRnCsC&amp;dq=burmese+monastic+examinations&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Buddhism, Power and Political Order|last=Harris|first=Ian|date=|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=9781134129478|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the socialist era from 1978 to 1988, the system of civilian titles was abolished altogether.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The practice of conferring Buddhist titles to civilians was reinstated on 24 May 1991 by the [[State Peace and Development Council|State Law and Order Restoration Council]], which added 20 new religious titles, including 3 scholarly titles, 4 domestic and international religious propagation titles, and 4 civilian titles for men, and 4 for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dra.gov.mm/?page_id=272|title=ဘွဲ့တံဆိပ် ဂုဏ်အင်္ဂါအရည်အချင်းသတ်မှတ်ချက်|last=|first=|date=17 June 2015|website=Department of Religious Affairs|publisher=Ministry of Religious Affairs|language=Burmese|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Modern-day system ==

A '''coloring book''' (or '''colouring book''', or '''colouring page''') is a type of book containing [[line art]] to which people are intended to add color using [[crayon]]s, [[Pencil|colored pencil]]s, [[marker pen]]s, [[paint]] or other artistic media. Traditional coloring books and coloring pages are printed on paper or card. Some coloring books have [[Perforation|perforated edge]]s so their pages can be removed from the books and used as individual sheets. Others may include a [[Narrative|story]] line and so are intended to be left intact. Today many children's coloring books feature popular [[character (arts)|cartoon character]]s. They are often used as promotional materials for animated motion pictures. Coloring books may also incorporate other activities such as [[connect the dots]], [[maze]]s and other [[puzzle]]s. Some also incorporate the use of [[stickers]].

==History==
[[Image:The Little Folks Paint Book.jpg|thumb|150px|''The Little Folks Painting Book'', 1879]]
Paint books and coloring books emerged in the United States as part of the "democratization of art" process, inspired by a series of lectures by British artist [[Joshua Reynolds]], and the works of Swiss educator [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] and his student [[Friedrich Fröbel]]. Many educators concluded that all, regardless of background, students stood to benefit from [[art education]] as a means of enhancing their conceptual understanding of the tangible, developing their cognitive abilities, and improving skills that would be useful in finding a profession, as well as for the children's spiritual edification.&lt;ref name="Absolutearts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2003/08/04/31263.html|title=Drawn to Art: Art Education and the American Experience, 1800–1950|year=2003|publisher=absolutearts.com|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[McLoughlin Brothers]] are credited as the inventors of the coloring book, when, in the 1880s, they produced ''The Little Folks' Painting Book'', in collaboration with [[Kate Greenaway]]. They continued to publish coloring books until the 1920s, when the McLoughlin Brothers became part of the [[Milton Bradley Company]].

Another pioneer in the genre was [[Richard F. Outcault]]. He authored ''Buster's Paint Book'' in 1907, featuring the character of [[Buster Brown]], which he had invented in 1902. It was published by the Stokes Company. This launched a trend to use coloring books to advertise a wide variety of products, including coffee and pianos.&lt;ref name="Absolutearts" /&gt; Until the 1930s, books were designed with the intent for them to be painted instead of colored. Even when [[crayon]]s came into wide use in the 1930s, books were still designed so that they could be painted or colored.&lt;ref name="PatJacobs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loti.com/then_now/Coloring_Books.htm|last=Jacobs|first=Pat|title=Coloring Books|accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coloring books are widely used in schooling for young children for various reasons.  For example, children are often more interested in coloring books rather than using other learning methods; pictures may also be more memorable than simply words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloringpagesonline.net/coloring-pages-online-a-helping-hand-for-parents-and-teachers/|title=A Helping Hand for Parents and Teachers|date=February 5, 2012|publisher=Coloring Pages Online|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coloring may also increase creativity in painting, according to some research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colorkid.net/benefits_of_coloring research]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a predominantly non-verbal medium, coloring books have also seen wide applications in education where a target group does not speak and understand the primary language of instruction or communication. Examples of this include the use of coloring books in [[Guatemala]] to teach children about hieroglyphs and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] artist patterns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Perspectives of Children's Literature in Guatemala | jstor=344988 | journal=Hispania | first=Sue | last=Misheff |date=September 1994 | volume=77 | issue=3 | pages=524–531 | doi=10.2307/344988}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the production of coloring books to educate the children of farm workers about "the pathway by which agricultural pesticides are transferred from work to home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1289/ehp.5203 | title=Nuclear Waste Transportation: Case Studies of Identifying Stakeholder Risk Information Needs |date=March 2003 | journal=Environmental Health Perspectives | volume=111 | issue=3 | pages=263–272 | last=Drew | first=Christina H. |author2=Deirdre A.

Faustman  | pmid=12611653 | pmc=1241381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coloring books are also said to help to motivate students' understanding of concepts that they would otherwise be uninterested in.

They have been used as teaching aids for developing creativity and knowledge of geometry, such as in [[Roger Burrows]]' ''Altair Designs''.

Since the 1980s, several publishers have produced educational coloring books intended for studying graduate-level topics such as anatomy and physiology, where color-coding of many detailed diagrams are used as a learning aid. Examples include ''The Anatomy Coloring Book'' and subsequent book series, by Wynn Kapit and Lawrence Elson, published by [[HarperCollins]] (1990s) and [[Benjamin Cummings]] (2000s).&lt;ref&gt;''The Anatomy Coloring Book'', Wynn Kapit and Lawrence M. Elson. HarperCollins, 1993, second revised and expanded edition, {{ISBN|0-06-455016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some examples of educators using coloring books to better explain complicated topics, like math&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Vn3GLf-4YkEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=coloring+book&amp;ots=mWvrVhWoy2&amp;sig=MVSjMedFtE-tFSCApYpacxV-AYE#v=onepage&amp;q=coloring%20book&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0045794979900622]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some publishers have specialized in coloring books with an explicit educational purpose, both for children and for adults. The books often have extensive text accompanying each image. These publishers include [[Dover Books]], [[Really Big Coloring Books]], [[Running Press]], and [[Malcolm Whyte|Troubador Press]].

==Health and therapeutic uses==
Coloring books have seen wide application in the health professions as educational tools. One nurse, trying to limit the trauma of surgery, described in an academic publication how the use of a coloring book "might help [the child] to understand what was going to happen to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Tonsil Season | first=Carolyn | jstor=3451768 | last=Harris | journal=The American Journal of Nursing | volume=61 | issue=1 |date=January 1961 | pages=91–92 | doi=10.2307/3451768}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used in rehabilitation of accident victims to aid recovery of [[hand–eye coordination]], and they are used with [[Autism|autistic]] children both for entertainment and for their soothing effect. Coloring books have been used to explain complicated medical conditions to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=R. |last1=McDonald |first2=A. |last2=Thomsen |first3=Y. |last3=Belessis |first4=A. |last4=Jaffe |date=June 2007 |title=292 CF and Me – a colouring book for children |journal=Journal of Cystic Fibrosis |volume=6 |issue=Suppl 1 |page=S71 |doi=10.1016/S1569-1993(07)60267-7 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569199307602677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the appeals of adult coloring books is that they help users relax and de-stress.&lt;ref name="Toronto Star"&gt;{{cite news|title=Colouring books designed for adults topping bestseller lists (Books by illustrator Johanna Basford (Secret Garden and Enchanted Forest) created as a way to de-stress) |date= April 6, 2015|accessdate=April 10, 2015|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2015/04/06/colouring-books-designed-for-adults-topping-bestseller-lists.html|work=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political uses==
In 1962, cartoonist [[Mort Drucker]] teamed with humorist [[Paul Laikin]] in creating the ''[[John F. Kennedy]] Coloring Book'', a satirical introduction to Kennedy, his family and administration, told from the point of view of his daughter [[Caroline Kennedy|Caroline]]. The book sold 2,500,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic

In 1968 the ''Black Panther Coloring Book'' began circulating in the United States; the book features black men and children killing [[List of slang terms for police officers#P|pigs dressed as police officers]].  It was argued to have been made not by the [[Black Panther Party]] but by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s [[COINTELPRO]] program to discredit the organization, a claim which other sources dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Some commentators have alleged that the book was a piece of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[agitprop]].

The term and concept of the "coloring book" was adopted by the [[feminism|feminist]] artist [[Tee Corinne]] as a tool of female empowerment. Corinne made pencil sketches of female genitalia, which she then inked and printed on card stock. She published a collection of them in 1975 as ''The Cunt Coloring Book.''
{{quote|No other name seemed really to fit, although the word "cunt" was not one with which I was particularly comfortable. The alliteration, though, was nice. I also liked the idea of combining a street term for genitalia with a coloring book, because both are ways that, as children, we get to know the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Tee | last=Corinne | title=Artist's Statement: On Sexual Art | authorlink=Tee Corinne | journal=Feminist Studies |date=Summer 1993 | volume=19 | issue=2 | pages=369–376  | doi=10.2307/3178374 | jstor=3178374}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In August 2011, American publisher Really Big Coloring Books released ''We Shall Never Forget: The Kids Book of Freedom'' detailing specific drawings in the accounting of [[SEAL Team 6]] shooting [[Osama bin Laden]] in his home. The book was criticized by some for portraying Muslims in a negative manner. The company has also published ''The Tea Party Coloring Book for Kids'', ''Ted Cruz To The Future'' (2013) and a book about President [[Barack Obama|Barack Obama's]] inauguration (2008).&lt;ref name="kenyonstar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallace|first1=Kenyon|title=9/11 children’s colouring book sparks controversy over portrayal of Muslims|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2011/08/30/911_childrens_colouring_book_sparks_controversy_over_portrayal_of_muslims.html|website=thestar.com|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.|accessdate=22 February 2016|date=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cruzcoloring"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/12/ted-cruz-coloring-book_n_4434114.html|title=Ted Cruz Coloring Book Selling Fast|last1=Weissert|first1=Will|publisher=Huffington Post|website=www.huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=22 February 2016|date=12 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305001258/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/12/ted-cruz-coloring-book_n_4434114.html|archivedate=March 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Fine art==
Photographer Jno Cook produced line drawings based on [[Robert Frank]]'s ''[[The Americans (photography)|The Americans]]'', and in 1983 published them in a limited edition as ''The Robert Frank Coloring Book''. In 1994, the [[National Gallery of Art]] used the images as [[party favor]]s for writers working on the catalog for a retrospective of Frank's work.&lt;ref name="jnocook"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Jno|title=The Robert Frank Coloring Book|url=http://jnocook.net/frank/rfcolor1.htm|website=jnocook.net|accessdate=22 February 2016|date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coloring books are a form of adult [[therapy]] that have seen a growth in popularity in the 2010s. They reportedly bring people a sense of their [[childhood]],&lt;ref name="MedicalDaily"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dovey|first1=Dana|title=The Therapeutic Science Of Adult Coloring Books: How This Childhood Pastime Helps Adults Relieve Stress|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/therapeutic-science-adult-coloring-books-how-childhood-pastime-helps-adults-356280|accessdate=13 April 2016|publisher=Medical Daily|date=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and help with developing fine motor skills and vision, reducing anxiety and creating focus, and relieving stress and anxiety in a manner similar to [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/06/health/adult-coloring-books-popularity-mental-health/index.html|title=Why adult coloring books are good for you|website=CNN|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrating on coloring may facilitate the replacement of negative thoughts and images with pleasant ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/therapeutic-science-adult-coloring-books-how-childhood-pastime-helps-adults-356280|title=The Therapeutic Science Of Adult Coloring Books|website=Medical Daily|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coloring books can be used in daily activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloringnotebook.com|title=Paper notebook with adult coloring pages|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books are also a way to get away from technology, which some regard as beneficial to people's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bratskeir|first1=Kate|title=Unplug From Technology: 19 Ways To Spend Time Off The Grid|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/27/unplug-from-technology_n_2762116.html|accessdate=13 April 2016 |publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com |date=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used by people who are uncomfortable with more creatively expressive forms of art.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;

While coloring books for adults were popular in the early 1960s, those were satirical works rather than the therapeutic works that define the adult coloring book form today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/126580/radical-history-1960s-adult-coloring-books|title=The Radical History of 1960s Adult Coloring Books|publisher=''The New Republic''|date=December 28, 2015|first=Laura|last=Marsh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercially successful adult coloring books were published in 2012 and 2013,&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt; and began increasing in popularity in 2015.

By 2016, [[Faber-Castell]], a worldwide color pencil supplier, was reported to have trouble keeping up with demand for their products due to the craze,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryall|first1=Jenni|title=All the adults colouring is leading to huge sales for pencil companies|url=http://mashable.com/2016/04/10/colouring-trend/#OD9Gr_TPMgqb|website=Mashable|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Blue Star Coloring]] sold over a million titles in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/02/10/books-how-adult-coloring-books-became-popular|title=How adult coloring books became a million-dollar trend|work=MPR News|date=February 10, 2016|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Author [[Susan Jacoby]] has criticized adult coloring books, along with the popularity among adults of [[young adult fiction]], as "an artifact of a broader cultural shift. And that cultural shift is a bad thing.”&lt;ref name="newyorkerraphael"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raphael|first1=Adrienne|title=Why Adults Are Buying Coloring Books (for Themselves)|url=http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-adults-are-buying-coloring-books-for-themselves|website=The New Yorker|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=21 February 2016|date=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes the [[Great Recession]] has contributed to this shift, as adults unable to find employment have moved home to live with their parents. New York City [[futurist]] and blogger Dominic Bulsuto describes adult coloring book fans as "stuck in The Shallows, mindfully coloring books to counter the existential angst of living in a digital society." He goes on to say that "...the endless Internet parade of silly cat photos, infantile comments and adolescent [[Internet meme|meme]]s has dumbed us down." However, Bulsuto ultimately sees the trend as a good thing, noting that adults are increasingly buying books they want to buy, rather than books they are supposed to buy.&lt;ref name=Coloringpost/&gt;

==Coloring book software==
Coloring books can also be found digitally in the form of coloring book websites and applications. Coloring book software often has features such as color mixing, [[Flood Fill|flood filling]], and paintbrush tools that allow for more accurate and detailed drawings than regular coloring books.

'''Commercial Modular Buildings''' are code-compliant, non-residential structures 60% to 90% completed offsite in a factory-controlled environment then transported or shipped to a final destination where the modules are then placed on a [[concrete]] foundation to form a finished building. The word "modular" does not describe a building type or style, it simply describes a means of construction.

The commercial modular construction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modular.org/htmlPage.aspx?name=About_Modular_Construction |title=Commercial Modular Construction }}&lt;/ref&gt; industry comprises two distinct divisions:

'''Permanent Modular Construction (PMC)''' – modular units built offsite and assembled onsite to create a permanent facility and not intended to be relocated. They are comparable to buildings built strictly onsite in terms of quality, life span, and materials used for construction.

'''Relocatable Buildings''' – modular units built offsite and assembled onsite that can be partially or completely reused and relocated at future building sites.

== Benefits ==

'''Accelerated Construction Process'''

[[File:Modular Construction Timeline.jpg|thumb|Simultaneous site development and construction at the plant reduces the schedule up to 50%]]

A primary benefit of [[modular construction]] is its fast delivery.  Due to the simultaneous process of creating modules in a factory at the same time site work is occurring, modular buildings can be constructed in up to half the time as buildings built completely onsite. This allows the buildings to be occupied sooner and allows owners to see a faster return on investment.

In order to save the most time and money and maximize the efficiency of the modular construction process, it is important to implement the modular construction at the beginning of the design-build process.

'''Cost Efficiency'''

Since structures are created offsite and have quicker delivery times, modular construction cuts down on labor costs associated with traditional construction, and owners can see a reduction of 10 to 35 percent in overall costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://comstruc.com/growing-popularity-modular-construction/|title=The Growing Popularity of Modular Construction - Commercial Structures Corp.|date=2017-09-15|work=Commercial Structures Corp.|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quality Built'''

Modular buildings are built with all the same materials and to the same building codes and architectural specifications as onsite construction, just completed in an offsite, quality controlled environment. Modular buildings are also built to be able to withstand travel and installation requirements, creating a building that can be more durable than structures built onsite.

'''Sustainable'''

* '''Less Material Waste''' - Modular construction makes it possible to optimize construction materials purchases and usage while minimizing onsite waste and offering a higher quality product to the buyer.

:According to the UK group WRAP, up to a 90% reduction in materials can be achieved through the use of modular construction. Materials minimized include: wood pallets, shrink wrap, cardboard, plasterboard, timber, concrete, bricks, and cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrap.org.uk/downloads/Modern_Methods_of_Construction_-_Summmary.a268f69e.3663.pdf |title=Current Practices and Future Potential in Modern Methods of Construction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Less Site Disturbance''' - The modular structure is constructed off-site simultaneous to foundation and other site work, thereby reducing the time and impact on the surrounding site environment. There is less truck traffic going to and from the construction site and a decreased presence of equipment and material suppliers, mitigating disruptions common to traditional construction sites, such as noise, pollution, and waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.constructionworld.org/7-benefits-prefabricated-construction/|title=7 Benefits of Prefabricated Construction - Construction World|website=www.constructionworld.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Greater Flexibility and Reuse''' - When the needs change, modular buildings can be disassembled and the modules relocated or refurbished for their next use reducing the demand for raw materials and minimizing the amount of energy expended to create a building to meet the new need. In some cases, the entire building can be recycled.
* '''Improved Air Quality''' - Many of the indoor air quality issues identified in new construction result from high moisture levels in the framing materials. Construction occurs primarily indoors away from harsh weather conditions preventing damage to building materials and eliminating the potential for high levels of moisture being trapped in the new construction.

Modular buildings can also contribute to [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] requirements in any category site-built construction can, and can even provide an advantage in the areas of Sustainable Sites, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, and Indoor Environmental Quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modular.org/marketing/documents/Modular_09V3LEED.pdf |title=Modular Building and the USGBC’s LEED ™ Version 3.0 2009 Building Rating System}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Modular construction can also provide an advantage in similar categories in the [[International Green Construction Code]].

== Uses ==

Modular builders provide all types of building space, from small temporary units to complex, multi-story permanent buildings. The most commonly served markets are education, healthcare, general office, retail and commercial housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icon-construction.com/2014/06/modular-dormitory/ |title=Modular Dormitory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in 2013, China was preparing to construct the tallest building in the world called "[[Sky City (Changsha)|Sky City]]" using modular construction. Despite a planned height of more than 2,000 feet (838 meters), construction was anticipated to take 90 days to complete, due to the efficiency of modular construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://speedspace.org/modern-modular-applications/|title=Modern Applications of Modular Structures - Speed Space|date=2017-02-07|work=Speed Space|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common industrial uses may include: Application Rooms, Laser Rooms, Equipment Enclosures, Environmental Rooms, Maintenance Rooms, or Storage and Security Rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://n-p.com/products/industry_solutions/industrial.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130926134610/http://n-p.com/products/industry_solutions/industrial.aspx |archivedate=2013-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial applications may include Offices, Reception Areas, Conference and Meeting Rooms, Copy Centers and Mail Rooms, Shipping and Receiving Rooms, Lunch Rooms and Cafeterias, Break Rooms, Dark Rooms, Training Rooms, and Storage Rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://n-p.com/products/industry_solutions/commercial.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130926134546/http://n-p.com/products/industry_solutions/commercial.aspx |archivedate=2013-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are many custom applications available that can make modular construction a viable and cost-effective solution for any business.

The '''Dacian bracelets''' are [[bracelets]] associated with the ancient people known as the [[Dacians]], a distinct branch of the [[Thracians]]. These bracelets were used as ornaments, [[currency]], high rank insignia and [[votive offerings]]&lt;ref&gt;&lt;ol class="references"&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Their ornamentations consist of many elaborate regionally distinct styles.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=212}} Bracelets of various types were worn by Dacians, but the most characteristic piece of their jewelry was the large multi-spiral bracelets; engraved with [[palmette]]s towards the ends and terminating in the shape of an animal head, usually that of a snake.{{sfn|Popescu|1971|p=45}}

== Dacians background ==
[[File:Muzeuldeistorienaturalavienaaurdacic7.JPG|thumb|right|Spiral motif with gold bracelet found in Romania (dated to Bronze IV = Hallstatt A){{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=57}}) repository [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]{{sfn|Burda |1979|p=17}}]]

The [[Dacians]] lived in a very large territory, stretching from the [[Balkans]] to the northern [[Carpathians]] and from the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Nistru|Tyras River (Nistru)]] to the [[Tisza|Tisa]] plain, and at times as far as the [[Middle Danube]].{{sfn|MacKenzie|1986|p=25}}

[[Dacian civilization]] went through several stages of development, from the [[Thracian]] stage in the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Geto-Dacian stage]] in the classical period that lasted from the 1st century BC to the 1st century AD.{{sfn|Giurescu|Nestorescu|1981|p=47}} The Thracian stage is associated with the emergence of Thracian populations from the fusion of the local [[Eneolithic|Chalcolithic]] stock with the incoming peoples of the transitional Indo-Europeanization Period.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|Boardman|1982|p=53}}{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=52}} By the time of [[Bronze Age]], and during the transitional period to the [[Iron Age]], the cultures of this Carpathian area may be attributed to proto-Thracian and even Thracian populations—ancestors of the peoples known to Herodotus as the Agathyrsae and the Getae, and to the Romans as the [[Dacians]] (by Iron Age II).{{sfn|Cunliffe|1987|p=59}}{{sfn|Dumitrescu|1972|p=259}} The culture of these nuclear groups were typified by military aristocracies.{{sfn|McHenry|Encyclopædia Britannica | 1993|p=602}}

In these early times the most specific motifs of the bracelets are the spiral and the horn, used to provide the warrior with both physical and deistic protection.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=57}}
* The ''spiral motif'' (i.e. bracelets from [[Sacosu Mare]], [[Şagu|Firighiaz (now Firiteaz)]], [[Săcueni]]) is associated with solar cults.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=53}}{{sfn|Burda|1979|p=17}} It might have been an inheritance of the local Chalcolithic culture,{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=57}} or an accentuated [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] influence to the north of the Danube.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|1972|p=258}}
* The ''horn motifs'' (i.e. bracelets from [[Pipea]], [[Şona|Biia (Şona)]], [[Şeica Mare|Boarta (Şeica Mare)]]) might have been brought by the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|intrusive stockbreeders (Proto-Indo-Europeans)]].{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=57}}

The 5th century BC is associated with the Dacian stage of art{{sfn|Megaw| 1970| p=32}}{{sfn|Sandars| 1976|p=51}} and it is the time of the [[La Tène]] period (Iron Age II) when Dacian culture flourished, especially in Transylvanian citadels.{{sfn|McKendrick|1975|p=19}} The Dacian art of Iron Age II has all the characteristics of a mixed style, with its roots in the [[Hallstatt culture]] (1200–500 BC).{{sfn|Halbertsma|1994|p=26}}{{sfn|McKendrick|1975|p=19}} It is characterized by an accentuated geometry, a curvilinear style and plant-based motifs.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=212}} At this time, besides their older local types, Dacians made all kind of bracelets that were common in the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Glodariu|1997|p=25}} But, there was a constant preference of Dacians for decorating the silver spiral bracelets with animals [[protome]] such as snakes and wolves.{{sfn|Sîrbu|Florea|2000|p=69}}

The period of time between the 2nd century BC and 1st century AD is termed "Classic Dacian".{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=63}} At this time the Dacians developed the art of silverworking, and a style which may be described specifically as the Dacian style. It consists of older traditional local elements, dating back to Iron Age I, but also of elements of Celtic, Scythian, Thracian, and especially Greek origins.{{sfn|Popescu|1959|p=22}}{{sfn|Halbertsma|1994|p=26}} The bracelets of this art-form include silver arm rings, with ends in the shape of stylized heads of animals, and heavy spiral-shaped armlets with gilded ends adorned with palm-leaves, and ending in animal-heads.{{sfn|Popescu|1959|p=22}}

The Classic Dacian period ends when parts of the [[Dacian State]] were reduced to a Roman province by the [[Roman Empire]] under [[Trajan]], partly in order to seize its [[gold mines]]. After the [[Second Dacian War]] (105–106 AD) Romans claimed they had looted 165 tonnes of gold and 300 tonnes of silver in a single [[wikt:haul|haul]], as estimated by modern historians. Its existence in only one spot (at Sarmizegethusa), suggests that there was a central control of precious metal circulation.{{sfn|Taylor|1994|p=406}} According to the majority of historians this sort of monopoly of precious metals, and the Roman's forcible collection of Dacian gold objects, explains the scarcity of archaeological discoveries consisting of golden ornaments for the period between the 3rd century BC and the 1st century AD;{{sfn|Seculici|2008|p=67}}{{sfn|Manaila|1976|p=90}} however, the existence of the "[[Treasures of Dacian kings]]" has been confirmed by the latest archaeological finds of large gold spiral-shaped bracelets from [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]]. It seems that the Romans did not find the entire royal treasure.{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2007|p=32}}{{sfn|Glodariu|Sima|Iaroslavschi|Gheorghiu|2008|p=146}}

== Bracelets in the transition period North Thracian and proto-Dacian ==
===Types of bracelets in the Bronze Age and First Iron Age===
Numerous bracelets were made of bronze and gold and many of them have been found in Transylvania, near the sources of the ores used in their manufacture.{{sfn|Coles|Harding|1979 |p=94}} They include the following types:
* unequally spiraled armlet made of bronze, worn on the forearm that is also called "arm guard" i.e. those found at Apa ([[Satu Mare County]]){{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}}
* equally spiraled bracelet, used frequently in the early Hallstatt i.e. [[Pecica]].{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}}
* open bracelet with widened ends, made of double gold wire i.e. [[Ostrovu Mare|Ostrovu Mare (Gogoşu)]].{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}}
* bracelet with spiralled or volutes endings i.e. [[Şagu|Firighiaz/Firiteaz]],{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}} [[Darova|Sacoșu Mare]].{{sfn|Leahu|2004|p=1}}
* open bracelet decorated with incisions, with each end coiled in double opposed volutes i.e. [[Darova|Sacoșu Mare]] and Hodiş ([[Bihor County]]).{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}}
* overlapped ends, rhombic cross section i.e. [[Darova|Sacoșu Mare]] and [[Şmig]].{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}} The treasures from Şmig [[Sibiu County]] and from [[Boroşneu Mare|Ţufalău (Boroşneu Mare)]] contained also raw gold, thus suggesting the bracelets had been locally made.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 227}}

Some bronze bracelet types of the Bronze Age (i.e. incised solid bracelets) continue throughout all the Late Bronze Age and Hallstatt phases.{{sfn|Coles|Harding|1979|p=409}}

==== Various bracelets ====
[[File:Dacian Gold Bracelet at the National Museum of Romanian History 2011 - 3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Hinova]]'s gold bracelet, Bronze Age{{sfn|Leahu|2003|p=134}} or early Hallstatt {{sfn|Laszlo|2001|p=350}}]]
Archaeological finds include two gold cylindrical muffs, a characteristic type of the middle and late Bronze Age and widespread throughout Central Europe. Two bronze specimens, both similar to the gold ones, have been discovered at [[Cehal|Cehăluţ]].{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=93}} The open cuff found at [[Hinova]], and dated to the 12th century BC, is one of the largest gold bracelets of the proto-Dacians found to date. It is made of large gold sheet of 580&amp;nbsp;grams (1.27 pounds) in weight and decorated with ten buttons fixed into holes, five on each end.{{sfn| Hagioglu|Gheorghies|2010|p=117}}{{sfn| Leahu|2003|p=1 poz. 134}}

Bracelets from [[Băleni, Galaţi]] (Late Romanian Bronze Age, Noua Culture) are particularly interesting because of their geometric décor, bands of right or oblique lines. They all have a green patina ranging from dark green to dull green, bluish green, bluish gloss.{{sfn|Vauthey|Vauthey|1968|p=345}}

The fragmentary iron bracelet from the cremation cemetery found at [[Bobda]] is among the few unequivocally dated iron objects equivalent to [[Hallstatt|Hallstatt A 1–2]] in this region.{{sfn| Stoia|1989|p=77}}{{sfn| Pleiner|1982|p=168}}

A bracelet with snake-shape endings had been found at the [[Hallstatt Culture|Hallstattian]] necropolis in [[Ferigile]] ([[Vâlcea County]]).{{sfn| Vulpe | 1967|p=73}}

==== Spălnaca (Hopârta) ====
The bracelets from [[Hopârta|Spălnaca (Hopârta)]] are dated to Bronze Age IV (Iron Age I){{sfn|Coles|Harding|1979|p=409}} and have decorations of geometric characters. Although not directly influenced by the Hallstatt styles, the objects from Spalnaca pre-date the later tendencies for geometric surface decoration of chiseled or engraved lines.{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=12}} Such discoveries at Spalnaca, Guterita and Dipsa show that bronze craftsmanship still flourished in the North Thracians from the Carpathian-Black Sea and Danube areas at the beginning of the Iron Age.{{sfn|Popescu|1971|p=37}}{{sfn|Petrescu-Dâmbovita|1996|p=597}}

==== Multi-spiral types ====
[[File:ThumbTezaurMNIR.JPG|thumb|right|Multi-spirals type gold bracelet from Hinova, Late Bronze Age{{sfn|Leahu|2003|p=136}} or Early Hallstatt{{sfn|Laszlo|2001|p=350}}]]
This type of Dacian bracelet originated in the Bronze Age.{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=93}} The hoard found in 1980 at [[Hinova]] includes two such bracelets.{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=93}} Multi-spiral types can be dated to the early Hallstatt periodand comprises also open and closed-end bracelets.{{sfn|Laszlo|2001|p=350}} One of the spiral bracelets from Hinova weighed 261.55&amp;nbsp;grams and the other 497.13&amp;nbsp;grams.{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=93}} The former, made of a thinner and narrower gold leaf, had a decoration consisting of two furrows cut along the edges and separated by a median crest.{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=93}} A similar decoration, of a furrow along the median line, decorates a metal bracelet from the deposit found at [[Sânnicolau Român]], dated to the second period of the Bronze Age.{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=93}}

Finds from Dacia include spiral bracelets made of double gold wire, the largest of which weighed nearly a hundred grams. Gold spiral bracelets of this type have been discovered in Transylvania and [[Banat]], spanning a long period which begins with the very late phase of the Bronze Age and ends with the middle Hallstatt. Similar pieces made of bronze were discovered in the deposit of bronze objects at [[Slătioara, Vâlcea|Sacot-Slatioara]].{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=94}}

The multi-spiral bracelet type spans a long period of time that includes all Hallstattian stages.{{sfn|Popa|Berciu|1965|p=63}}

=== Spiral motif ===
[[File:Muzeuldeistorienaturalavienaaurdacic9 quandrangular and crenelated.jpg|thumb|Quadrangular bracelets ([[Sighetu Marmaţiei]]?) The small ones may have been used as currency.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 212}}]]
The traditional ornamental motifs of bracelets, the meander and the "whirling" spiral (i.e. Oradea, Firiteaz and Sacosul mare), are thought to follow the spread of a cult of the sun, their decorations suggesting the rotation of the sun on the heavenly vault.{{sfn|Dragut |Florea|1984|p=31}} This motif is recognized as one of the parallels between the artifact decorations of this North Thracian group and the ornamentations from the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[Shaft Graves]]. It is found in both the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean]] and east-central Europe from the Neolithic onwards.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=53}}

Scholars opinions are divided on the source of these comparable traits. One opinion states that the North Thracian spiral motifs originate from the local [[Eneolithic|Eneolithic (Chalcolithic)]] antecedents rather than from any imported influence.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=57}} There are specific forms widespread in northern Thrace that are unlikely inspired by the Mycenaeans.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=57}} It is also argued that these motifs apparently did not appear in the intervening territory of South Thrace.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=53}} With North Thracians, the spiral motif appears prominently in the form of massive armguard (armlet) terminals, offering physical as well as [[apotropaic]] protection.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=53}} Hoddinott states that the twin spiral terminals, as on the bowl from [[Şona|Biia]], would have been a natural development; either from a local single armlet type or from an [[Unetice culture|Unetice]] spectacle pendant.{{sfn| Hoddinott |1989|p=53}}

The other opinion attributes the spiral motif to a northward spread of Mycenaean influence.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|1972|p=258}} It is argued that the spiral of the Neolithic period disappeared during the transitional period towards the Bronze Age, and even during the Early Bronze Age; therefore, starting from the Middle Bronze Age the spiral would occur because of a Mycenaean sway to the north of the Danube.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|1972|p=258}} These comparable features might have occurred because of commercial relations between the Mycenaeans and Dacians relating to the gold mines of Transylvania.{{sfn|Samsaris|1989|p=169}}

==== Spiral ending types ====
===== Sacoşu Mare =====
Whatever may have been the origin of the spiral motif, the craftsmen of the late [[Bronze Age|Carpatho-Danubian Bronze Age IV]] and [[Hallstatt|Hallstatt A]] had a marked preference for bracelets with a spiral ending, as found at [[Sacosu Mare]].{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=94}} The same décor featuring the coiled disk endings of the single- or double-spiral bracelets is found on contemporary ceramics.{{sfn|Burda|1979|p=17}} There is also a striking resemblance between the gold bracelets from Sacoșu Mare, from [[Şagu|Firighiaz (or Firiteaz)]], and from other locations in Transylvania that suggest a spiritual affinity in the proto-Dacian world.{{sfn|Burda|1979|p=17}}

The hoard from Sacoşu Mare consists of bracelets and jewelry dated to the 13th to 12th centuries BC (Late Bronze Age and Hallstatt I).{{sfn| Leahu|2004|p=1}} The golden bracelets, around 74.15&amp;nbsp;grams (2.6 ounces), have open ends of approximately 6.6&amp;nbsp;cm (2.6&amp;nbsp;inches) in diameter. Some terminate with convex volute ends,{{sfn| Leahu|2004|p=1}} while others have double convex volute ends.{{sfn| Leahu|2011|p=1}} The bracelet's bar is decorated with engraved rows of diamonds flanked by dotted lines.{{sfn| Leahu|2011|p=1}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===== Firighiaz (Firiteaz) =====
The finds from [[Şagu|Firighiaz (Firiteaz)]], [[Arad County]], on left bank of the Lower [[Mureş River]], are representative of the spiral motif bracelets of this period.{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=57}} {{sfn|Dumitrescu H|1941|p=141}} The Firiteaz's treasure contains twenty-three bracelets made of gold bar, each weighing 0.2&amp;nbsp;kg (0.44 pounds), and the hoard is housed in the Vienna Museum.{{sfn|Burda |1979|p=17}} Bracelets made of bronze, similar to the Firiteaz ones made of gold, had been found in Transylvanian deposits dated to the Early Iron Age.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=215}}

The Firighiaz treasure comprises three types of bracelets:
* made of quadrangular cross-section bar; they are tapered at both ends (Type 1, dated to Late Bronze Age){{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=136}}
* made of quadrangular cross-section bar; inverted spirals ends (Type 2){{sfn|Dumitrescu H|1941|p=141}}
* made of semi-round cross section bar; these terminate with double volute spirals at each end (Type 3, dated to the 8th to 7th centuries BC){{sfn|Dumitrescu H|1941|p=141}}

The earliest type one bracelets did not have ornamentations, while the later ones are engraved with groups of lines and angles or group of lines that alternate with lozenges (i.e. those from Sălaj).{{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=133}} This type is also common to the sites in: [[Domanesti]] ([[Sălaj County]]), [[Tăuteni]] ([[Bihor County]]) and [[Şpălnaca]] ([[Alba County]]).{{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=136}} Bracelets with quadrangular cross-section had previously been made of bronze, such as those at the beginning of the Hallstatt period. The gold ones are numerous, but are mostly of small dimensions; these smaller ones are considered to have been used as currency.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 212}}

The type two bracelets coil into spiral discs at only one end (terminal). At a later time, between the 8th and 7th centuries BC, they coiled at both terminals similar to the type three bracelets.{{sfn|Dumitrescu H|1941|p=141}}

The designs in type 3 bracelets, double-coiled (one at each of the two terminals), have also been found in bracelets from [[Şona|Biia]] ([[Alba County]] Romania), [[Fokoru]] (Heves, Hungary) and [[Bilje]] (Croatia).{{sfn|Dumitrescu H|1941|p=141}}

Spiral types similar to the Firighiaz type two have been found in a large area of Central and North-Western Europe: [[Bohemia]], North-East Hungary, [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Poznań]], West Poland, [[Pomerania]], [[Lithuania]], North [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], Germany ([[Bavaria]], [[Wurttemberg]], [[Turing]], [[Mecklenburg]]) and [[Romania]]. Their prototypes may have been provided by the [[Lusatian Culture]].{{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=140}} Some scholars believe that these bracelets were a kind of defensive weapon. This view is supported by the fact that this type was found usually on weapons deposits in Germany,{{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=137}} and that they appear to have been worn on the upper arm, as the traces of wear indicate.{{sfn|Childe|1930|p=120}}{{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=137}}

These locally-made bracelets from Firighiaz (Firiteaz), and from other [[Transylvanian]] finds, are half the size of the armlets of the similar style found in Germany and they could not be worn. It seems they were simple ornamental objects, a common trait to many similar items found in [[Romania]].{{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=137}} Transylvanian bracelets of this type are described as nearly circular with 57 and 63&amp;nbsp;mm diameter. Their rods are of a circular cross-section (max. 10&amp;nbsp;mm thickness) gradually tapering towards the ends, where the cross-section becomes quadrangular and begins to curl in a spiral. The diameter of the spiral discs is 30–35&amp;nbsp;mm. Each of these discs are made from four spirals.{{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=137}}

===== [[Acâş]] and [[Săcueni]] =====
According to Pârvan (1928), the style of Firighiaz artifacts evolved over a considerable period of time into the later form styles of the Dacian [[Hallstatt]]ian bracelets as found at [[Săcueni]] ([[Bihor County]]), [[Pipea]] ([[Mureș County]]) and [[Şona|Biia]] ([[Alba County]]).{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=57}}

Bracelets with double-volute ends like with Firighiaz type two, but with a different style, have been found at [[Acâş]] and [[Săcueni]].{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 215}} These are made of lozenge bar with a décor made of relief globule (similar to bracelets found at [[Saint-Babel]]) with double-coiled terminals.{{sfn|Eluère|1982|p=163}} The gold bracelets from [[Săcueni]], as well as those from [[Acâş]] ([[Satu Mare County]]) and [[Hajdúszoboszló]] (Hungary) are typical Dacian bracelets of the Hallstatt period.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=330}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Bronze bracelets of this type had previously been found in deposits belonging to the first Hallstatt period. Their ornamentation and groups of motifs is similar to the Firighiaz (Firiteaz) type. Analogous bracelets had also been found at [[Oradea]].{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 215}} Two bracelets with spiral ends, dated to the Iron Age, have also been found in Dacian tombs of the Lower Danube.{{sfn|Linas|1887|p=288}}

=== "Horn motif" from Pipea, Biia and Boarta ===
[[File:Dacian goblet from Biia.jpg|thumb|right|The golden goblet from Biia with twin spiral terminals of the handles.{{sfn| Hoddinott |1989|p=53}}]]
Bracelets from [[Şona|Biia]] and [[Pipea]], found in the 19th century, have an unclear chronology.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=239}} This series comprises a find from [[Abrud]] and another from an unknown [[Transylvania]]n location.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=59}} Some archaeologists are reporting them as dating to the Hallstatt,{{sfn|Şandric|2003|p=2}}{{sfn|Şandric|2008|p=2}} though Márton (1933) dated them to the early La Tene period.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=222}} Popescu (1956) estimates these can be dated to the Hallstat phase B (1000–800 BC), but no later than C (800–650 BC).{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=239}} whereas Mozsolics (1970) dates them to 1,500 BC.{{sfn|Mozsolics|1970|p=143}} The so-called Biia bracelet was found with the Biia gold "[[kantharos]]" that can be dated between 1,500 and 1,000 BC.{{sfn|Eluère|1991|p=7o}} The handles of this goblet are also coiled into a double-spiral motif similar to other types of bracelets from the Carpathian area (i.e. Firigiaz 3, or Acas-Sacueni).{{sfn|Bouzek |1985|p=52}}

There, specimens are made of bronze and are prototypes of the Pipea–Biia–Boarta series of bracelets; therefore, scholars agree these bracelets had been made locally, in the Transylvanian goldsmith workshops. This opinion is supported by metal analysis.{{sfn|Kovacs|2001|p=48}}

These types of bracelets are possibly [[votive offering]]s, reminiscent of the [[Bull (mythology)|cult of the bull]].{{sfn|Eluère|1987|p=76}} Their common trait is the stylized motif of "horns". All of them have large C-shaped "horns" as terminals.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=59}}  As with the spiral, Hoddinott purports that the east-central European bronzesmiths used this horn symbol to provide the warrior with both physical and deistic protection.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=58}} In the Aegean Shaft Graves it occurs only on a stele, a gold bowl and three pairs of gold earrings, which Hoddinott considers to be possibly of central European origin.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=59}} This thematic motif of the Carpathian peoples is confirmed by other archaeological finds from Transylvania that include three large rings weighing between 0.20 kilograms (0.44 pounds) and 0.60 kilograms (1.32 pounds). Their terminals are animal heads facing each other, depicting the heads of horses in two cases and bulls-heads in the third.{{sfn|Eluère|1987|p=58}} Eluere (1987) identifies the endings of the Pipea-Biia bracelets with the cultic and religious powerful horns of the bull, and estimates that this myth was perpetuated for centuries.{{sfn|Eluère|1987|p=58}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

According to Hoddinott (1989), [[Horned deity|the horned animal cults]] that are attested with these horns motifs were brought by the transitional Indo-Europeanization period immigrants who adopted these stylized motifs as their main apotropaic symbol;{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=57}} however, the symbols of the horned animal replaced the local ones but were later associated with the sun-fire symbols of the earlier culture.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1981|p=165}}

The bracelet from [[Bilje]] (Croatia) belongs to the same Biia-Pipea type.{{sfn|Eluère|1987|p=76}}  Hartmann noted that the percentage of silver and tin in the bracelets from Belly (Croatia) and Pipea (Romania) is almost identical. This suggests both bracelets had been made in the same region.{{sfn|Kovacs|2001|p=48}} According to Marton, the armlets with semi-moon ends are part of an evolutionary series that terminates with the later silver snake-headed bracelets of the Classical Dacian times.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=222}}

==== Boarta type ====
The bracelet from [[Şeica Mare|Boarta (Şeica Mare-Sibiu County)]] was discovered in 1891 and is dated to 600 BC. It might be an example of the last phases in the evolution of the Biia-Pipea gold artifacts (For the photo of Boarta bracelet see the gallery of links {{sfn|Wittenberger|2010|p=1}}) A very similar copy of the Boarta type has been found with the treasure from [[Dalj]], [[Slavonia]].{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=217}}

Unlike the Biia-Pipe type bracelets, the Boarta bracelet is flat, band-shaped, and has three raised ribs resembling the body of two other bracelets from [[Oradea]]. Its semi moon-shape terminals are smaller than the Biia-Pipea terminals;{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=217}} thus, some scholars derive the type of the Boarta bracelet to be from some earlier bronze bracelets whose ends widen and whose bodies have more ridges.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=221}}

It seems that some other bracelets found at [[Bihor County|Bihor]], Oradea, [[Targu Mures]] and [[Timiș County|Făget]] could possibly belong to the Boarta type, and not to the Biia-Pipea type.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=217}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Mosna, Sibiu County ====
The terminal adornments of this gold bracelet look like animals' heads, but the zoomorphic motif almost disappeared because of the geometric stylization (see picture ''Mosna 1'' above). It is dated to the Hallstatt period. This is not an isolated item, since it is stylistically connected to the geometric and zoomorphism of a collar and two bracelets from [[Veliki Gaj]] (Hungarian Nagygáj, Romanian Gaiu Mare) in Serbia.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=345}}

== Zoomorphic bracelets ==
[[File:Muzeuldeistorienaturalavienaaurdacic4brasov.JPG|thumb|right|Gold bracelet with horse heads from [[Vad-Făgăraș]], [[Brașov County]] at [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=221}}{{sfn|Coles|Harding|1979|p=366}}]]
In the past, on the basis of a relatively small selection of archaeological finds, some scholars considered that the art of Geto-Dacians was geometrical and non-iconic. This led to the zoomorphic representations of Dacian bracelets being seen as an expression of the art of the steppes people, and Scythian art in particular. The majority of archaeological finds to date show that the main aspect of Geto-Dacian [[toreutics]] is in fact a zoomorphic motif style of its own.{{sfn|Gramatopol |1992|p=1}} This Dacian style of animal art occurs at the time when various ancient historical sources begin to record the Geto-Dacians as an ethnic entity of the larger Thracian family; therefore, this artistic expression might be considered as specific to the Dacian society of the last centuries BC.{{sfn|Gramatopol |1992|p=1}}

Some scholars sustain that the zoomorphic motifs of that particular time do not represent any kind of zoolatry of the Geto-Dacians. These would be iconographic motifs highlighting and multiplying certain attributes of the deities or of the kings.{{sfn| Sarbu| Florea |2000|p=152}}

=== Ox-headed bracelets (Târgu Mureş, Apoldu de Sus, Vad) ===
The tendency towards the apotropaic zoomorphism that crystallized at the end of the Iron Age I (i.e. bracelets from Biia, Pipea, Boarta etc.) is clearly manifested with the bracelets possessing ornamented ox heads of the Iron Age II (La Tene) from [[Târgu Mureş]] (Mureş County), [[Apoldu de Sus]] (Sibiu County), [[Şercaia|Vad]] (Braşov County) and one from an unknown Transylvanian find.{{sfn|Sanie|1995|p=24}} The bracelet from Apoldu de Sus seems to have an ox head at one terminus and a ram's head at the other end.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 218}}

The ox-head bracelets have been associated with the clay Hallstatian's [[Moon idol]], with which they  undoubtedly share a similarity.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=221}}

The wires of these series of bracelets are thick, and decorated with ornamental protrusions.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 218}} Their characteristic decor consists of [[relief]] or incised circles, while there are also those with cuts or incisions that form a fir-tree motif.{{sfn|Sanie|1995|p=24}}

A bracelet with ox-heads discovered in the 19th century at Târgu Mureş (see [http://www.lessing-photo.com/dispimg.asp?i=07020269+&amp;cr=44&amp;cl=1 picture]) had been dated by some scholars to La Tene.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=546}} Others such as Popescu (1956) dated this particular one to the last period of the Hallstatt, since it might have been deposited together with a semi-moon type bracelet of that period.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=239}} As for the technique, it is noted that the bracelet from Targu Mures show a control of three-dimensional modeling,{{sfn|Sherratt|1984|pp=22, 23}} with silver inlays.{{sfn|Popescu|1950|p=28}} There are two other bracelets of a similar type in the Transylvania Museum, though they are known to be discovered in Transylvania the original site is unknown.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=217}}

The religious meaning of the sacred horn had been lost over time, the circlets keeping this shape can only be described as decorative ornamentation.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=221}} The bracelet found in 1817 at Vad–Fagaras (Brasov County) terminating with horse heads depicted as wearing a bridle, is part of the general trend of bracelets replacing the sacred horn as a motif.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=221}}{{sfn|Macrea|1978|p=197}}

}}
In 1959 two bracelets terminating with "horned-horses", were found at [[Cucuteni|Băiceni (Cucuteni)]].{{sfn|Sanie|1995|p=151}} They are dated to the end of the Iron Age I{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}} and are found in the context of a hidden treasure of a Dacian nobleman.{{sfn|Makkay|1995|p=341}} The treasure comprised 2 kilograms of gold ornaments; a helmet, necklace, appliqués, harness, and buttons for vestments. They were ceremonial ensemble for kings or noblemen and their horses.{{sfn|Sîrbu|2004|pp=46, 47}} The bracelets and necklace terminate with [[protome]]s of horse heads and exhibit strong Thracian roots.{{sfn|Sîrbu|2004|p=47}}

The heads have also been interpreted as goat-heads ([[ibex]]).{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}} Each head is very made of embossed gold foil with a filigree composition,{{sfn|Burda|1979|p=30}} and had sun-symbols on the middle of the forehead. They also have what may be seen as ram's- or goats-horns (see picture "''Head 1''" on the right).{{sfn|Sanie|1995|p=151}} These Băiceni gold artworks of the 4th century BC are viewed as one of the links transferring the Thracian and North Thracian Art forms and motifs across to the Dacian silversmiths.{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=27}}

== Iron Age II (La Tene) ==
Dacians replaced gold, the popular Transylvanian metal during the Iron Age I period, with silver during Iron Age II.{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=187}} The types of ornaments also changed, perhaps due to new social structures and hierarchy or due to changes of the preferences of the populous and [[sacerdotal]] aristocracy.{{sfn|Sîrbu|2004|p=54}}

Dacians absorbed influences from the western Celts and eastern Scythians, but also proved their artistic originality.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=540}} The bracelet style of the former is more individual, as they synthesized the older local elements originating from the Bronze Age into a new combination adapted to include the contemporary decorative forms and motifs.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=540}}

Objects specific to warriors (armors, harnesses etc.) became preponderant from the 5th century BC onwards, in contrast to the decorative objects (bracelets, torques and pendants) that predominated in the Bronze Age, and in the transition period leading up to the Iron Age.{{sfn| Gramatopol | 1992|p= 1}} In the 2nd and 1st centuries BC gold and silver military objects are replaced so that the treasures of the late Dacian La Tene comprise ceremonial ensembles of silver ornaments and clothing accessories, bracelets along with some [[Typology of Greek vase shapes|mastos or footed cup]] vases .{{sfn|Sîrbu| 2007| p= 864}}{{sfn|Sîrbu| 2004| p=54}}

The geometrical and spiral motif ornamentation of earlier bracelets is more often replaced with zoomorphic and vegetal representations.{{sfn| Gramatopol | 1992|p= 1}} The decorations of bracelets that have been found, across the whole territory inhabited by Dacians, consist of lines cut into fir-tree shapes, dots, circlets, [[palmette]]s, waves, and bead motifs.{{sfn|Daicoviciu|1971|p=63}}

=== Toteşti bracelet ===
[[File:Gold snake-head bracelet Totesti-Hateg.jpg|thumb|left|Snake-headed Dacian bracelet from [[Totesti]]. Transitional Hallstatt-La Tene period{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=546}}]]
Various single-spiral bracelets made of solid quadrangular (rhombic) gold bars, whose overlapping ends represent the head of a snake, were found in 1889 at [[Toteşti]] in [[Hunedoara County]].{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=545}}{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=339}} The head is geometrically stylized but clearly defined by decorative details. This artifact belongs to the so-called "Classic Dacian" period{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=339}} and described as a "primitive work done by a not skilful hand".{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} It was noted that the snake head is realistically depicted by the representation of the eyes, ears and other elements of the [[vipera ammodytes]] that is so commonly found in the area. The same scholars related these gold circlets to the later silver multi-spirals snake [[protome]] and palmette bracelets from [[Romos|Vaidei-Romos]], [[Bălăuşeri|Senereuş]], [[Hetur]], [[Marca, Sălaj|Marca]] and [[Oradea Mare]].{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=545}} Other scholars consider that [[Toteşti]] snake-headed ornaments should be interpreted on the basis of an abstract contemporary stylistic type, and not as an imitation of reality. In this interpretation [[Toteşti]] bracelets are not connected with the snakes from the region of Deva, but they are a tradition that began in Hallstatt times with the "Scythian rings" and continued into the La Tène period.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=546}}

In the [[Scythian tombs]] of Northern Hungary that are related to the Scythian invasions from around 700 BC, as well as in those of central Romania, spiral-shaped rings known as the "Scythian rings" have been found; with one end forming a fantastic animal, such as a dragon or serpent. These apotropaic creatures, themselves [[Turano-Siberian]] varieties of old [[Mesopotamian monsters]], might have provided the model for the Dacian protome bracelet from [[Toteşti]]{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=58}}—but neither the Scythian animals nor the Greek decorations appear to have had great success in Dacia, since the native geometric style continued to predominate.{{sfn|Henry|1928|p=288}}

Analogies to the Totesti bracelets can be found not only to the multi-spiral bracelets, but also in the overlapping-end bracelets whose ends  sometimes terminate with stylized animal heads.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 227}}

== Bracelets in the "Classical Dacian" period of the Dacian State ==
The Dacian silver bracelet is one of the characteristic artworks of this period, and the most representative ornament on them is the snake protome.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1986|p=87}}{{sfn|Popescu|1959|p=22}} Dacian bracelets have mainly been thought of as women's adornments but it can not be excluded that some types of bracelets, especially the multi-spirals ones, represented insignia of politico-military and [[sacerdotal]] functions and therefore worn by men.{{sfn | Berindei | Candea | 2001|p=749}}

Bracelets became part of the objects that Dacians selected as votive offerings deposited outside settlements. Such offerings have been found in a fountain at [[Ciolanestii din Deal]], Teleorman County, where silver bracelets and vases dated to 2nd or 1st century BC were found, and finds beside a lake in a forest at [[Contesti, Argeş|Contesti]], Argeş County, where bracelets, pearls, and a [[drachma]] were found.{{sfn|Sârbu|2007|p=862}}

Types of the La Tene II  period (150 BC – 100 AD) include:
* Bracelets with the ends curled back around the bracelet's wire i.e. [[Cerbal]] (Hunedoara County) and Remetea (Timis County){{sfn|Popescu|1948|p=54}} {{sfn|Turcu|1979|p=153}}
* Bracelets made of multiple twisted wires i.e. at [[Cerbăl]]{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=542-543}} In the La Tène Age, this type appears to have been developed from the twisted types of the Bronze Age IV from Spalnaca.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=550}}
* Bracelets with double torsade i.e. [[Cerbăl]]{{sfn| Spanu | 2003|p=11}}

=== Regional finds ===
According to Horedt (1973), silver Dacian treasure finds can be typologically categorized into north and south groups, divided by the [[Târnava River]]. In the contact zone between them the artifacts are common to both zones.{{sfn|Rustoiu|2002|p=97}} In this classification the silver multi-spiral bracelets that are ornamented with palmettes and snake protomes would belong to the southern group.{{sfn|Rustoiu|2002|p=97}}

==== East of the Carpathian Mountains ====
The Dacian bracelets that have been found East of the Carpathians can be categorized into two main types:
* Non-joined ends i.e. those found at [[Poiana, Galaţi|Poiana]] (Galati County) and Gradistea ([[Brăila County]]). Numerous specimens are made of bronze, such as those found at Brad, Racatau and Poiana.{{sfn|Rustoiu|2002|p=102}}{{sfn|Condraticova|2010|p=117}}
* Overlapped ends that are coiled onto the wire itself.{{sfn|Rustoiu|2002|p=102}} {{sfn|Condraticova|2010|p=117}} This type has ornamentation consisting of geometrical motifs and sometimes of snake protomes.{{sfn|Condraticova|2010|p=117}}

The characteristic metals used for bracelets found in the area of the [[Siret River]] valley are bronze and iron,{{sfn|Rustoiu|2002|p=102}} though silver was also probably used; a silver bracelet was found with a treasure of coins buried after 119–122 AD.{{sfn|Rustoiu|2002|p=97}}

In the Prut-Dniester region sub-types have been  identified such as:
* Bronze bracelets such as those found at [[Trebujeni]], [[Maşcăuţi]] and [[Hansca]]
* Non-joined ends, bar with vegetal décor such as those from [[Tudora, Ştefan Vodă|Palanca-Tudora]]
* Bracelets made of 3–6 twisted bronze wires with flattened ornaments in the middle.{{sfn|Condraticova|2010|p=118}}
* Multi-spiral types, such as the bracelets from the treasure found at [[Mateuţi]] ([[Rezina District]]) dated to the 4th century BC. This treasure includes two silver bracelets, one with five spirals and one with three.{{sfn| Arnăut|Naniu|1996| p= 44}}

==== Moesia Superior ====
Dacian bracelets have been found in deposits from [[Tekija (Kladovo)|Tekija]], [[Bare (Požarevac)|Bare]],{{sfn|Popović|2004|p=41}} [[Veliko Središte]]{{sfn| Mărghitan | 1979|p= 164}} and [[Paraćin]].{{sfn|Kolaric|1970|p=22}}

The style and type of the bracelets from Tekija and Bare are similar to the Dacian silver types; i.e. bracelets made of twisted wire and bracelets with overlapped ends that are coiled around the wire itself.{{sfn|Popović|2004|p=41}} Even though the origins of this type should not necessarily be located in Dacia itself, since bracelets of this type are scattered throughout the entire Balkan-Danube area, the earliest dated bracelets from Tekija and Bare are very large, as were those typical of the Dacian cultural complex.{{sfn|Popović|2004|p=42}} Bracelets with ends shaped as a head of, or tail of, a serpent are well represented in the Dacian deposits that are found at the Bare.{{sfn|Popović|2004|p=42}}

The Dacian bracelets that are decorated with spiral end-pieces, i.e. Belgrad—[[Guberevac (Leskovac)]], along with thin Dacian silver necklaces found in East Serbia, characterize the presence of a Dacian La Tene culture at [[Paraćin]] in Serbia.{{sfn|Kolaric|1970|p=22}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Bracelets with cord ornaments ===
An important category of the jewelry in the Daco-Getic environment are bronze bracelets with cord ornaments, whose typology consists of three types held in the Blaj Museum and in Simleul Silvaniei. Such [[circlet]]s had been discovered at Ardeu, Cuciulata (Brasov), Costesti (Hunedoara), Ocnita (Valcea), Pecica (Arad), Simleul Silvaniei (Sălaj), Tilisca (Sibiu) and in the Orăstie Mountains.{{sfn| Plantos | 2005|p=77}} These ornaments do not seem to be specific to pre-Roman Dacia, as they were widely spread in contemporary Germany, Poland, Czech, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia—all during the La Tene period.{{sfn| Plantos | 2005|p=78}} Since their diameter is around 10&amp;nbsp;cm, apart from those found in Simleul Silvaniei and Orăstie which are 6&amp;nbsp;cm and 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm, they were probably worn on the arm or as anklets.{{sfn| Plantos | 2005|p=79}} They have been found mainly in fortresses or important centers of pre-Roman Dacia, and appear to have been prestige items of the local aristocracy.{{sfn| Plantos | 2005|p=79}}

=== Bracelets with a double torsade ===
This type have been found with treasures from Cerbăl (Hunedoara County), Bistrita (Bistriţa-Năsăud County), [[Drăgeşti]] (Bihor County), [[Oradea-Sere]] (Bihor County), [[Saracsău]] (Alba County), and [[Tilişca]] (Sibiu County). The bracelets are made of wire turned two or three times to form a semicircular terminal. The three-turns style is seen only with a single bracelet from Cerbăl. These terminals are always decorated with stamped-dotted lines and are dated to the 1st century BC.{{sfn| Spanu | 2003|p=11}}

This type was designed and preferred by the intra-Carpathian regions. Only one presence occurs in the Danube area, at Iron Gates.{{sfn| Spanu | 2003|p=12}} Since this bracelet appears to have been a prestige ornament, its presence south of the Carpathians is seen as a component of the relationships between the elites of the two neighboring regions.{{sfn| Spanu | 2003|p=12}}

=== The material of bracelets ===
[[File:KunsthistorischesMuseumDacianGold3.jpg|thumb|right| Dacian silver ornaments ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum]])]]
[[File:KunsthistorischesMuseumDacianGold6.jpg|thumb|right|Silver Dacian treasures (dated to La Tene) found in Transylvania Romania (Kunsthistorisches Museum)]]

In the Bronze Age IV and Hallstatt periods Dacia was characterized by gold treasures and by a particular gold art, whereas archaeological finds dated to the La Tene period are mostly made of silver.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 244}}{{sfn|Glodariu|Sima|Iaroslavschi|Gheorghiu|2008|p=146}} This is a common characteristic of the Illyrian and Eastern Alps regions of the time, and not limited to the Dacian area.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 244}} Some scholars, such as Glodariu, explain the scarcity of gold ornaments and bracelets in Dacian treasures by a custom of the Dacians, Celts, Germans and Romans in reserving golden ornaments for the king alone.{{sfn|Glodariu|Sima|Iaroslavschi|Gheorghiu|2008|p=146}} Other scholars, such as Florescu, put forth the hypothesis of religious restrictions regarding the use of gold in the period of the Dacian state.{{sfn|Florescu|1970|p=135}}

The golden Dacian bracelets, and indeed most of the jewelry, that has been found so far are made of unrefined gold from the [[Apuseni Mountains]].{{sfn|Oberländer-Târnoveanu|Gheorghe|Migdonia|Tudor|2010|p=9}}

The silver of the Dacian bracelets and other ornaments of the time always contain between 0.63 and 6.35% gold.{{sfn|Seculici|2008|p=69}} In some scholars opinions, such as Oberländer-Târnoveanu, it was obtained by melting Greek and Roman coins as well as importing from Balkan sources.{{sfn|Oberländer-Târnoveanu|Gheorghe|Migdonia|Tudor|2010|p=9}} Others, Popescu for example, support the thesis of a local extraction of silver from the Apuseni Mountains.{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=197}}

The work and typology of the silver multi-spirals snake-headed bracelets suggests the existence of a large manufacturing center, located most probably near the Dacian sites of the [[Orastie Mountains]].{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=188}} From there silver artifacts spread throughout the entire area of modern-day Transylvania; and, as archaeological finds prove, these art works become later known in areas that encompass the modern regions of [[Moldavia]], [[Muntenia]] and [[Oltenia]].{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=188}}

In the second phase of La Tène, reasoned on the basis of finds, Dacia appears to have experienced a temporary "silver crisis", probably related to an increase in the minting of silver [[denarii]]; therefore, bracelets dated to that time had been made of mild alloy and only plated with a silver layer about 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm (0.004&amp;nbsp;inch) thick. The layer was so well welded that the welding can not be identified by the naked eye, even in cross sections.{{sfn|Glodariu|1997|p=25}} Specimens of the group include finds from [[Sarmasag]] (Salaj County) and [[Dersca]] (Botosani County). There were also similar finds at [[Slimnic]] (Sibiu County) and Herastrau Bucuresti.{{sfn|Rustoiu|1996|p=47}}
[[File:KunsthistorischesMuseumDacianGold1.jpg|thumb|left|A gilded silver belt fragment Cioara – Alba County dated [[La Tene]] depicts warriors wearing bracelets{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=532}}]]

=== Representations depicting the wearing of Dacian bracelets ===
The Dacian phalera from [[Cergău|Lupu-Cergău, Alba County]], depicts a feminine divinity wearing some circlets on her arms. Some scholars identified these with a representation of the Dacian bracelet types.{{sfn|Spânu|1998|p=49}}{{sfn|Crișan|1993|p=45}}

In 1820 at [[Săliştea|Cioara (today Săliştea)]] a fragmentary gilded silver plaque was discovered, dated to La Tène III, and primitively decorated ''[[au repousse]]'' ("by embossing"), with representations of two human characters, probably warriors.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=106}} Hatched bands are visible on the arms and wrists  that resemble regular bracelets.{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=16}} Even though the motifs of the plaque do not seem to be local, since it differs in some respects from those depicted on [[Trajan's Column]], the silver-work itself seems to be Dacian. Other than the Dacians, no-one was working in this style at that time. The silversmith who made it is probably the same one who made the well known Dacian snake-headed bracelets from Hunedoara County.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=534}}

A fragment from the Forum of Roman Emperor Trajan (2nd century AD) in Rome has a relief of a seated female, probably a Dacian (''Dacia Capta'' – "the conquered Dacia"). She is depicted wearing a bracelet on each arm below the shoulder.{{sfn|Packer|Sarring |1997|p=377}}

===Bracelets with a snake-motif===
This motif is found with both the multi-spiral bracelets and also with the simple bracelets.{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=641}}
[[File:Dacian bracelet type Slimnic1.jpg|thumb|left|Dacian bracelet from Transylvania; [[Slimnic]] type (La Tene Age){{sfn|Popescu|1948|p=54}}]]

* Multi-spiral silver bracelets terminating with portions of [[palmette]]s and snake [[protome]] terminals at each end, i.e. those found at [[Cojocna]], [[Mărunţei|Bălăneşti (Mărunţei)]], [[Rociu]], [[Coada Malului]]{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}}{{sfn| Spanu |Cojocaru|2009|p=99}} [[Caţa|Drauseni (Caţa)]] (destroyed by 1941),{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=198}} [[Feldioara]] and [[Orastie]].{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=196}} The endings of some of the bracelets were gilded: i.e. [[Coada Malului]] {{sfn|Vauthey|Vauthey|1968|p=346}} and [[Orastie]].{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=196}}
* Multi-spiral bracelets with snake-heads at each terminal, but whose terminals do not have the palmettes, that are plaques decorated with large scales, i.e. those from [[Herastrau|Herastrau (Bucuresti)]] dated to the 1st century BC.{{sfn| Spanu |Cojocaru|2009|p=99}} A bracelet from [[Buneşti-Avereşti|Bunesti]] ([[Vaslui County]]) is similar to the one from Herastrau, but it is dated earlier than the 1st century BC.{{sfn| Bazarciuc |1983|p= 264}}
* Simple bracelets, where stylized snake heads terminate the ends.{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}} The ends are either in the shape of an animal's head summarily but adroitly stylized, as in the case of the [[Slimnic]] bracelets, or in other cases the animal's head is suggested by a few engraved lines, and the decorated ends were gilded.{{sfn|Popescu|1971|p=45}} Finds include those from: [[Ocnita]] (Valcea County),{{sfn|Rustoiu|1996|p=46}} [[Poiana, Galaţi|Poiana]] (Tecuci),{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=201}} Săcălăsău Nou (Bihor County),{{sfn|Gorun|Doina|Sever|Lucia|1988|p=116}} in Romania; and also from [[Jakabszállás]] in Hungary.{{sfn|Toma|2007|p=66}}
* Bronze bracelets cast and incised with snake [[protome]]s, i.e. those found in [[Râşnov]], [[Braşov County]], and dated to the 2nd or 1st century AD.{{sfn|Costea|2008|p=1}}

==== Description of the silver multi-spiral bracelets with palmettes and protomes at both terminals ====
There are about 27 known Dacian silver or silver-gilt multi-spiral bracelets terminating with rectangular plaques and snake head [[protome]]s. They are exhibited or kept in repositories and museums in Bucharest (Romania), Budapest (Hungary) and Belgrade (Serbia).{{sfn|Constantinescu|2009|p=1031}} Additionally the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] holds Dacian silver bracelets such as the one found at [[Orastie]] (Hunedoara County){{sfn| Candea| 2010|p= 52}} and the one from Feldioara (Brasov County).{{sfn| Candea| 2010|p= 52}}{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=21}}
[[File:Dacian Silver Bracelet at the National Museum of Romanian History 2011.jpg|thumb|left| Silver bracelet from [[Rociu]] ([[Arges County]])]]

All of these silver works are characterized by their large size. For example, the one found at [[Bălăuşeri|Senereuş]], now in the [[Brukenthal Museum]] weights aropund 0.4 kilograms (0.88 pounds). The wire used is 206&amp;nbsp;cm (6 feet 9&amp;nbsp;inches) long and 0.4&amp;nbsp;cm (0.157&amp;nbsp;inches) thick, while the heads are 21&amp;nbsp;cm each (8.26&amp;nbsp;inches). The inside diameter of the coils is 12.5&amp;nbsp;cm (4.92&amp;nbsp;inches) with an outside diameter of 13.3&amp;nbsp;cm (5.2&amp;nbsp;inches). These large diameters and the heavy weight of these armlets would suggest wearing them on the upper arm or on the leg.{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=548}}{{sfn|Oberländer-Târnoveanu|2011|RAN ID=115691.01}} The coils of the specimen from [[Cluj Napoca]] have an even bigger outside diameter at 16&amp;nbsp;cm (6.3&amp;nbsp;inches);{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=196}} therefore, it is supposed that it was worn on the thigh or forearm over clothes{{sfn|Popescu|1971|p=45}}

The specimen from the Transylvanian Museum at Cluj weighs 0.358 kilograms (0.79 pounds). It has been made by hammering a silver bar of a circular cross-section. It has 4 spirals and the ends are flattened, decorated with seven palmettes made by punching. The surfaces of the palmettes, and their extremities, are decorated with the "fir-tree" motif and incised circles.{{sfn|Pupaza|2010|p=1}}

The multi-spiral from Belgrad Museum has an interesting particularity in that the impression of the palmette motif has two [[puncheon (barrel)|puncheon]]s of different dimensions. This might have been done in order to avoid the stereotypy of models.{{sfn| Mărghitan | 1979|p= 164}}

===== Origins =====
Snakes are depicted in Dacian toreutics from the 6th and 5th centuries BC, and also in the later period.{{sfn | Sanie| 1995|p=145}} Both types of bracelets with snake protomes, those of simple and multiple spirals, show an ancient Thracian tradition from the Hallstatt period (the Geto-Thracian period) of Geto-Dacian art evolution.{{sfn|Berciu|1974|p=217}} Snake-shaped bracelets, and other ornaments of the same kind, speak not only of the spread of the decorative motif but also of a symbol and significance of this motif in the Dacian period.{{sfn|Ispas|1980|p=279}}

Some scholars suppose that the Scythians provided the model of the snake décor found in the Classical Dacian bracelets, on the basis that the semi-spiraled Scythian snake type rings, were common in Dacia after the Hallstatt period. Those rings might have been continuously used until the La Tène period, or perhaps until the Roman era, as can be seen with a necropolis from [[Roşia, Sibiu|Caşolţ]], Sibiu County.{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=641}}{{sfn| Banateanu| 1971|p=38}} If this was the case, Shchukin suggests it was a matter of transferred ideas rather than of imports.{{sfn| Shchukin| 1989|p=89}}

These bracelets types can be explained by the typology of the local tradition of the Hallstattian period; and there were similar bracelets in the Thracian world of today's Romania and Bulgaria.{{sfn|Berciu|1974|p=217}}{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=27}} Such examples include a mid-3rd-century BC spiral dragon-headed ring; a spiral snake-headed ring from [[Nesebar|Nesebar (Messembria)]]; 4th century BC spiraled bracelets from [[Aitos]]; and a 3rd-century BC snake-headed ring of unknown origin in the British Museum.{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=27}}

The manufacture of the spirals, by wrapping the silver wire several times, belongs to the traditions of the Bronze Age;{{sfn|Henry|1928|p=290}} but those with their ends flattened, and decorated on the outside with [[intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] palmettes, belong to a more modern style according to Popescu.{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=193}} The way in which these dragon patterned bracelets were developed by the Dacians was new, while its resemblance to the workmanship and style of other countries are so few, that these bracelets might very well be considered as specifically Dacian. It can be distinguished as a Dacian style since they remained faithful to their own geometric representations,{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=141}} and the palmette motif is not found in the neighboring areas.{{sfn | Mărghitan | 1979|p=164}}

==== The dragon and snake-head motif ====
Within the multi-spiral  group of bracelets with palmette scales, two sub-groups can be stylistically identified – one represented by the Feldioara find and the other by the Orastie find. These sub-groups show that the snake and dragon types were not absolutely immutable in the imagination of the Dacian silversmiths. Two variants were introduced: mammal head – snake head and crest – mane,{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=27}} as well as some transitional versions.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=22}}
[[File:Dacians bearing the draco on Trajan's Column.jpg|thumb|right| The Dacian symbol [[Dacian Draco]] as depicted on the [[Trajan's Column]]]]
[[File:Dacian bracelet-ends snake-heads.jpg|thumb|left|Details of the "dragon" head of both ends; Silver bracelets from [[Hetur]], [[Romos|Vaidei (Romos)]] and [[Darlos]] Romania{{sfn|Hampel|1888|p=278}}]]

The bracelet discovered around 1856 at [[Orăștie]] consists of a single silver wire, with a circular cross-section, coiled into eight equal spirals terminating in a dragon head at both ends. It is analogous to the bracelet from Feldioara but its head is different in that the head is almost triangular.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=25}} It has been made in a richer figurative manner than others.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=14}}

The multi-spiral bracelet with zoomorphic (snake?) ends, found in 1859 with a treasure from [[Feldioara]], is different because of the widened muzzle of the [[protome]] terminals. In the middle of the snake head the Dacian silversmith engraved braids, by the use of puncheons, consisting of two rows of small, oblique, divergent traits. The snake's eyes are depicted as two circles. A strong profile separates the head from a relatively rectangular plaque with rounded corners, and slightly arched edges representing the mane of the [[Dacian Draco|Dacian dragon]]. The profiled relief edges of the bracelet's rectangular plaque and its decoration with two rows of divergent slashes are suggestive of the mane of a dragon or wolf.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=87}}

The bracelets from the Museum of Transylvania found in Cluj, Hetiur ([[Mureș County]]) and [[Ghelința]] are characterized by a more [[wikt:trenchant|trenchant]] cutting and a more prominent relief for modeling the head. These traits are unlikely to represent a specific ophidian form and the longitudinal axis is marked by a stylistically different means.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=22}}

The zoomorphic motif of the bracelets depicts a fantastic animal with the head and body of a serpent but the muzzle of a mammal, pointed or square, with a thick mane flowing on its back prolonged by a poly-lobed (multiple palmettes) body. {{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=87}}{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=141}} The analysis of these Dacian symbols, performed by scholars—such as Florescu (1979), Pârvan (1926), and Bichir (1984)—conclude that the symbol of the snake or dragon appears on the Geto-Dacian La Tene bracelets and on the [[Dacian Draco|Dacian standard (flag)]] that can be seen on [[Trajan's Column]].{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=87}}{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=141}}{{sfn|Bichir|1984|p=54}} The Dacians dragon probably combines two meanings: the agility and redoubtable ferocity of the wolf with the protective role of the snake.{{sfn|Sârbu|2000|p=170}} It was supposed to encourage the [[Getae]] and to scare their enemies.{{sfn| Sirbu | 1997|p= 89}} It also appeared to have been the only one known representation of the religious character of the Dacians of the time.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=641}} Scholastic interpretations vary between considering this a representation of a "flying dragon", related to a [[Sky God]],{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=520}} or a [[chthonic]] symbol.{{sfn|Tutilă|2004|p=5}}

Some bracelets from south of the Carpathians, such as those from [[Coada Malului]], [[Dâmbovița County|Bălăneşti]] and [[Rociu]]; and some from north of the Carpathians such as those from [[Dârlos]] and [[Romos|Vaidei (Romos)]]) do not have decorative elements to mark the median line on the rectangular plaque (the wider and flat portion coming next to the head). They instead have wavy lines, finely engraved, suggesting a mane or ridge.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=26}} A similar style is seen in specimens from [[Bălăuşeri|Senereuş]], [[Dupuş]] (Sibiu County) and from the unknown Transylvanian site, the fragment of which is kept at the Budapest Museum. On the latter, the beam of wavy lines has been replaced by horizontal, short and dense, finely engraved lines.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=26}}

The rectangular portion of the bracelets from Bălăneşti and Transylvania show a tendency to split into two teardrop-shaped lobes.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=26}} On the subgroup of bracelets from [[Coada Malului]], the fir-tree is depicted only schematically.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=26}}

It was also noted that the snakes from the Agighiol artifacts of the 4th century BC, especially the depicted heads of snakes, have a stylization similar to that of the Dacian bracelet protomes; they have the same triangular form, and the same distribution of the decorations that mark the eye of the snake.{{sfn|Berciu|1974|p=217}}

====The leaf motifs of the multi-spiral bracelets====

The flattened bands of the bracelets are decorated externally with a chain of geometrized palmettes that have been struck in much the same way as coins.{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=141}} It seems that the leaf-like ornaments have been made by impression, using ready-made moulds, as used in the manufacture of Dacian cups from the La Tène [[Balaciu|Crasani (com. Balaciu)]] site. Scholars, such as Popescu, related the chain of successive palmettes of the Dacian bracelets to the decoration of the borders on the Scythian Melgunov dagger sheath from the 6th century BC.{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=193}} Others consider that several multi-spiral bracelets, i.e. from [[Mărunţei|Balanesti]] (Olt), have the same palmette motif as the typical decorations of the 4th-century BC Thracian-Getic helmet from [[Valea Nucarilor|Agighiol (com. Valea Nucarilor)]], [[Tulcea]].{{sfn|Berciu|1974|p=210}} In the opinion of Berciu, the palmette motif was adopted from the Greeks of the Black Sea coast during the Geto-Thracian Art period.{{sfn|Berciu|1974|p=217}}

Dacian bracelets exhibit four decorative types of leaf-like triangular lobes: first is the most complex is of oval or triangular palmettes; the second is interpreted as representing fern leaves (e.g. the Orastie bracelet); the third is the fir-tree motif, where the rounded lobes become straight lines resembling a fir-tree branch; and the fourth whose shape preserves only the medial [[Leaf#Veins|vein]] and the circles, suggesting the spiral arching of the lobes (e.g. the Feldioara bracelet).{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=87}}

The palmettes are more precisely outlined and more faithfully preserve the original lobes and palmette character, with several bracelets such as those from the Cluj Museum, Hetiur and Ghelinta. They are farthest away from a schematic fir-tree motif.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=22}} A stylized ivy leaf-like style is common to the group of bracelets from Coada Malului, Rociu and Bălăneşti ([[Arges County]]), and Dupuş. It is formed using carved lines doubled with a fine series of dots.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=27}}

===== The same motif seen in other ornaments =====
The decorative snake style has been adopted in other types of ornaments, such as earrings from [[Blandiana|Răcătău]] and spiral rings from [[Sprâncenata]] and [[Mihăileşti|Popeşti-Novaci]].{{sfn|Sîrbu|Florea| 2000|p=169}}

The silver ring from [[Măgura, Teleorman]] has four-and-a-half multi-spirals with snake-head terminals and a chain of five palmettes.{{sfn|Mirea|2008|p=1}} It belongs to a small silver treasure—comprising three [[denarii]] that could be dated between 148–106 BC, and one ornament (the ring) —fortuitously discovered in 2005 and 2006 in a spot 330&amp;nbsp;m from Măgura village.{{sfn|Mirea|2009|p=99}} The ring is considered by some, e.g. Mirea (2009), to be a miniaturized representation of the typical multi-spiral bracelets terminating with palmettes and snake protomes.{{sfn|Mirea|2009|p=100}} There are particular analogies with the bracelets from Bălăneşti–Olt and Rociu–Argeş; as well as analogies with the spiral rings from Sprâncenata and Popeşti.{{sfn|Mirea|2009|p=100}} The decorations are similar to a motif of the gold multi-spiral bracelets discovered in 1999–2001 at [[Sarmizegetusa Regia]].{{sfn|Mirea|2009|p=100}}

The multi-spiral bracelets made of plates with zoomorphic extremities, all of them made of silver and sometimes gilded, are characteristic of the north-Danubian Dacian elite, in particular ones from Transylvania.{{sfn|Arsenescu|Sirbu|2006|p=170}} Also, according to Medelet (1976), one Dacian silver bracelet from [[Malak Porovets]] ([[Isperih Municipality]] Bulgaria) and one Dacian silver bracelet from [[Velika Vrbica]] (Serbia), belong to the same typology.{{sfn|Spânu|Cojocaru|2009|p=111}} Some of this type of bracelets, such as the one in the [[Cluj-Napoca Transilvanias History Museum]] and the two others in the National Museum Budapest (Hungary), are from unknown Transylvanian sites.{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=27}}

It is possible the big silver multi-spirals were used with clothes worn for special celebrations,{{sfn|Sîrbu|Florea| 2000|p=169}} though they do not seem to have a simply decorative use.{{sfn|Crișan|1986|p=26}} {{sfn| Sârbu |2007|p=864}} The context of burying these prestige aristocratic insignia suggests that the treasures they compound were rather votive deposits than funeral offerings ([[cenotaph]]?).{{sfn|Spânu|1998|p=52}}

The silver snake-headed multi-spiral bracelets are found in the context of the so-called Dacian silver treasures.{{sfn| Sârbu| Florea|1997|p=32}} A significant fact regarding these treasures is the specificity of the time frame, from around 125 BC – 25 AD (one century).{{sfn|Spânu|1998|p=46}} In historical terms, they are contemporary to the reigns of [[Burebista]], [[Deceneus]] and [[Comosicus]]. It is probable that the hoards of silver bracelets and ornaments of the late Geto-Dacian began to be produced just prior to the reign of [[Burebista]], a possible example being the one from Sâncrăieni. The manufacturing of silver ornaments continued during his reign, although to a lesser extent (perhaps due to his authoritarian, despotic and purist nature), and mostly after his suppression of the manufacture (44 BC – 46 AD); therefore the silver hoard production lasted almost a century.{{sfn|Gramatopol|2008|p=1}} The burying of these Dacian silver jewelry items and bracelets (those made between 44 BC and 46 AD) occurred in the same period of time that was characterized by a scarcity of silver due to the turbulent situation in Dacia.{{sfn|Gramatopol|2008|p=1}}

This particular type of design has a unitary typology and a highly standardized character. It does not contain goods that had been accumulated over years, but only sets of certain objects.{{sfn|Spânu|1998|p=46}} Also, they have not been found in the context of settlements but outside them, on carefully prepared deposits.{{sfn|Spânu|1998|p=47}} These objects had not been temporarily concealed or hidden, because of some exposure to dangerous situations, but they were rather supposed to preserve the symbolic attributes of the social status in the afterlife.{{sfn|Spânu|1998|p=49}}

Several Dacian bracelets reached the collections of the Kunsthistorisches Vienna Museum through various channels: administrative, auctions, purchases, and donations. Though they were found in Transylvania, and belong to the similar archaeological context of the other Dacian silver treasures, they are rather accidental discoveries from the west and south of the Transylvanian plateau—both in the areas of the greatest concentration of Dacian culture in the [[Orăştie Mountains|Orăştie]] and [[Apuseni Mountains]], where precious metal mineral deposits were, and are, to be found.{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=85}}

[[File:Dacian Bracelet IMG 7402.JPG|thumb|left|Dacians gold bracelet from Sarmizegetusa Regia]]

Gold artifacts in general, and gold bracelets in particular, have been scarce archaeological finds during excavations. An explanation could be that the Romans collected all gold objects by force after conquering Dacia.{{sfn|Manaila|1976|p=90}} Some, including Manaila, explained the scarcity of these kinds of archaeological finds as due to Dacian religious reasons, all gold being collected by the priests and given to the Dacian king.{{sfn|Manaila|1976|p=90}} Numerous researchers, including Rustoiu, argued the existence of a royal monopoly of the gold and silver exploitation in Dacia;{{sfn|Rustoiu|1996|p=51}} and that after the Roman conquest, this monopoly passed to the Roman Emperor.{{sfn|Popescu|1971|p=44}}

=== Description ===
These gold bracelets, adorned with leaves and snake heads, weigh around 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) each.{{sfn|Watson|2011|p=1}} There are remarkable analogies between the gold armlets and those made of silver from [[Măgurele, Prahova|Coada Malului]] (Prahova County), Senereuş (Hunedoara County), [[Orăştie]] (Hunedoara County) and [[Herăstrău]]-[[Bucureşti]].{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2007|p=12}} Most of them exhibit similar design and artistic themes, but there are no two identical bracelets.{{sfn|Constantinescu|2008|p=1}}
The decorations on these bracelets is similar to the style of the ring from Magura ([[Teleorman County]]).{{sfn|Mirea|2009|p=100}}

One such bracelet recovered in 2007 has both terminals depicting a stylized animal head, which represents a snake with a long muzzle, and is decorated with arched lines. The rectangular plaque's surface is decorated with transverse rows of arched incisions, grouped in four and a half [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]]. The body is composed of seven palmettes, consisting of a fir tree-shape, and a dotted line in the middle, while the terminals oppose each other.{{sfn|Trohani |2007|p=1}}

The number of spirals varies from six to eight. When uncoiled, some bracelets measure 2.30 m and others 2.80 m. The outside diameters range from 91 to 123&amp;nbsp;mm. The spirals consist of flat rectangular strips with richly incised decorations and stylized palmettes. In most of them, seven palmettes decorate both ends of the bracelets.{{sfn|Constantinescu|2009|p=1031}} The bracelets terminate with a decorative [[protoma]], a beast-head motif which looks like the head of an animal (a wolf, a snake or a dog).{{sfn|Constantinescu|2008|p=1}} The [[goldsmith]] technique, used for manufacturing all of these gold armlets, was the cold hammering of a rectangular-shaped gold ingot, followed by punching and engraving for their decorations. This was a typical method used by Dacians from the 4th century BC to 1st century AD.{{sfn|Constantinescu|2009|p=1031}}

A bracelet recovered in 2009 has ten spirals. The terminals depict a stylized snake protome. The long muzzle is straight cut and the eyes and eyebrows are represented by curved lines. The head continues onto a rectangular plaque of 3.4&amp;nbsp;cm in length whose relief edges are decorated with incised oblique lines in a "V" shape, separated by a medial line. This is followed by a series of six triangular-oval palmettes, made by three puncheons, and with a length of 14.3&amp;nbsp;cm. The first puncheon made the first two palmettes, the second made the next two palmettes, and the third was used for the last—which is also the smallest palmette. The palmettes have a foliage design and their edges are raised and decorated with small incised oblique lines.{{sfn|Trohani |2009|p=1}}

=== Context ===
[[File:Sarmizegetusa temples.jpg|thumb|right| Ruins of temple of the ancient [[Dacian language|Dacian]] fortress of Sarmizegetusa (Hunedoara County – Romania)]]
Some two dozen of the gold multi-spiral zoomorphic-headed bracelets were discovered by archaeological looting in different spots in the area of Sarmisegetusa Regia, in the Orăștie Mountains.{{sfn|Constantinescu|2009|p=1028}} By 2011, twelve out of the twenty-four looted gold bracelets had been recovered and are housed at the Romanian National History Museum in Bucharest.{{sfn|Watson|2011|p=1}}

An archaeological context has been reconstituted on the basis of a forensic science approach, technical description, and archaeological interpretation. The multi-spiral bracelets had been uncovered from pits near to the "Sacred area" of the Dacian capital at [[Sarmizegetusa Regia]] (Hunedoara County), around 600&amp;nbsp;m from the sacred enclosure. The pits are located on the steep rocky slopes outside the ancient settlements, in a narrow valley.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=109}} The bracelets site is located on a very steep and rocky area that involves a difficult climb and hinders "classical" archaeological approaches and research.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=109}}

The treasure hunters discovered a spot where they found ten golden bracelets in a pit dug into natural rock on a 70° slope.{{sfn|Glodariu|Sima|Iaroslavschi|Gheorghiu|2008|p=146}}  The pit had two distinct overlapped cavities of triangular shape made of slabs, one containing six  gold multi-spiral bracelets and the other four, that had each been deposited in pairs; the smaller bracelets were inserted into the larger ones.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=99}} The finding of bracelets on such steep sloping cliffs, and at the outer limits (eastern) of the settlements, provides a new perspective regarding the ancient sites used for depositing artifacts with special religious significance.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=109}} These deposits are composed of the same type of ornaments that have identical function and significance.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=109}}

The general circumstances of the placement of these bracelets, deposited by the ancient populous, in these specially constructed pits and covered with uncut slabs imply that these artifacts were components of votive offerings.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=110}}{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2010|p=1040}} It seems as if these bracelets were used during initiations, or occult ceremonies, restricted to a certain category of people that had very important positions in the state: the king; the leaders of cities; the nobles from the royal entourage; and the priests.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=110}} This explains the existence of similar pieces made of silver for the leading nobles and rulers of the cities, and the lack of similar specimens made of bronze, iron or other metals. It also explains why these types of bracelet do not appear in written sources, nor the figurative representations of the time.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=110}}

=== Chronology and authentication ===
Based on typological analogy and stylistic analysis, historians believe that these bracelets are authentic Dacian artifacts.{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2007|p=11}} Some chronological evidence is provided by dark blotches that indicate a long period of time underground, and also by the ancient coins that were found along with bracelets. These coins point to the late 2nd century BC and the first decades of the 1st century BC. It appears that the bracelets were buried, if not necessarily crafted, during a time frame between 100 – 70 BC.{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2010|p=1040}}

The chronology of these bracelets corresponds to the emergence of the building of religious sanctuaries, digging and arranging pits with a religious purpose where deposits of offerings to the [[chthonic|chthonian]] gods had been made.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2010|p=110}}

In 2007 a compositional analysis of these gold objects was performed using a non-destructive method, [[particle-induced X-ray emission]] (micro-PIXE measurements) and synchrotron [[X-Ray fluorescence]] (SR-XRF) analysis.{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2007|p=26}} More studies were performed in 2008 and 2009 by a team consisting of members from the National Institute for Nuclear Physics and Engineering, Romania, the National History Museum of Romania, and the BAM Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing, Germany. Researchers compared the gold composition, examining the trace [[platinum group]] elements, [[Tin]], [[Tellurium]], [[Antimony]], [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]], and [[Lead]] and comparing them with the corresponding elements of natural gold from [[Transylvania]]. This was done since these trace-elements are more significant for provenancing archaeological metallic-artifacts than the main element components.{{sfn|Constantinescu|2008|p=1}} For these studies, several small fragments of natural Transylvanian gold – placer and primary – were analyzed using: the micro-PIXE technique at the Legnaro National Laboratory AN2000 micro-beam facility, Italy, and at the AGLAE accelerator, C2RMF, Paris, France; and by using micro-synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (micro-SR-XRF) at the BESSY synchrotron, Berlin, Germany.{{sfn|Constantinescu|2008|p=1}} The studies of the teams concluded that the gold multi-spiral bracelets found between 1999–2001 at Sarmizegethusa had been made of native Transylvanian gold and not refined gold.{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2007|p=26}}{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2010|p=1041}}

Because of the adverse conditions surrounding the hoard's discovery, their origins may never be authenticated to the full satisfaction of archaeologists and scientists.{{sfn|Watson|2011|p=1}} Sceptics suggest that the bracelets could have been produced in modern times from metal obtained by melting ancient gold coins, Dacian coins of the KOSON type or Greek Lysimachus coins; however, the analyses performed so far do not confirm the use of gold from these coins in the bracelets' manufacture.{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2010|p=1038}}

It is most likely that no other group of ancient goldwork has been more thoroughly examined by scientists, technologists and scholars in various countries and various institutions than the Dacian gold spirals with dragon terminals found between 1999–2001 at Sarmizegethusa. In each case-study, and completely independent from each other, their examinations led to the same conclusion.{{sfn|Deppert-Lippitz|2008|p=1}}

'''''Delicatessen''''' is a 1991 French [[post-apocalyptic]] [[black comedy]] film directed by [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]] and [[Marc Caro]], starring [[Dominique Pinon]] and [[Karin Viard]]. It was released in North America as "presented by [[Terry Gilliam]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mike | last=Clark | title=New on DVD | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2006-05-04-new-on-dvd_x.htm | work=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] | date=5 May 2006 | accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In a dilapidated [[apartment building]] in a [[post-apocalyptic]] country, food is in short supply and grain is used as currency. On the ground floor is a [[butcher]]'s shop, run by the [[landlord]], Clapet, who posts job opportunities in the ''Hard Times'' paper as means to lure victims to the building, whom he murders and butchers as a cheap source of meat to sell to his tenants.

Following the murder of the last worker, unemployed [[circus]] [[clown]] Louison applies for the vacant position. During his routine maintenance, he befriends Clapet's daughter, Julie, a relationship which slowly blossoms into romance. Louison proves to be a superb worker with a spectacular trick knife and the butcher is reluctant to kill him too quickly. During this time several of the tenants fall under Louison's boyish charms, worrying others who are more anxious for their own safety should they require meat. Aware of her father's motives, Julie descends into the sewers to make contact with the feared Troglodistes, a group of vegetarian rebels, whom she persuades to help rescue Louison.

During the apparent butchering of an old woman, the Troglodistes attack but are repelled, and Clapet, with the unsympathetic tenants, storms Louison's room in an attempt to murder him. Louison and Julie resist by flooding themselves, floor to ceiling, in an upper floor bathroom until Clapet opens the door releasing the flood and washing the attackers away. Clapet returns with Louison's knife and inadvertently kills himself. Louison and Julie play music together on the roof of the now peaceful apartment building.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=February 2016}}
The film was received well critically. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "a zany little film that's a startling and clever debut."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Delicatessen | url=https://variety.com/1990/film/reviews/delicatessen-1200428946/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803025218/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790343.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |author=Variety Staff | date=31 December 1990 | archivedate=3 August 2008 | dead-url=no | accessdate=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' called it a "fair bet for cultdom, a lot more likeable than its subject matter suggests, and simply essential viewing for vegetarians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Jack | last=Yeovil | title=Delicatessen Review | url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/delicatessen/review/ | work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date=1 January 2000 | accessdate=31 August 2009 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015032836/http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?DVDID=7845 | archivedate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all reviews were positive, however, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' saying "its last half-hour is devoted chiefly to letting the characters wreck the sets, and quite literally becomes a washout when the bathtub overflows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Janet | last=Maslin | publisher=The New York Times Company | title=Review/Film Festival; Please, How Many Lentils for Your Musical Saw? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/05/movies/review-film-festival-please-how-many-lentils-for-your-musical-saw.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=5 October 1991 | accessdate=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Seal of Ireland''' was the [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] used until 1922 by the [[Dublin Castle administration]] to authenticate important state documents in Ireland, in the same manner as the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] in England. The Great Seal of Ireland was used in the [[Lordship of Ireland]] (1180s–1534) and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1534–1800), and remained in use when the island was part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (1801–1922),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1927/mar/30/royal-and-parliamentary-titles-bill#S5LV0066P0_19270330_HOL_30|title=Royal and Parliamentary Titles Bill|date=30 March 1927|work=Hansard HL Deb|pages=vol 66 c886|quote=When the Union with Ireland took effect in 1801, and from that time onwards, the Great Seal was frequently described in Acts of Parliament as the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, but the old Great Seal of Ireland continued to be used for many documents relating solely to Ireland. |nopp=Y |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; just as the [[Great Seal of Scotland]] remained in use after the [[Act of Union 1707]].

==Use==
The office of "Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of Ireland" was held by the [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]]. The Chancellor was presented with the physical seal upon taking his [[oath of office]], and it was otherwise kept in the [[Court of Chancery (Ireland)|Court of Chancery]].&lt;ref name="oflanagan1870v1p16"/&gt; When the Chancellor was absent, Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal were appointed.&lt;ref name="oflanagan1870v1p16"&gt;O'Flanagan 1870, Vol.1 p.16&lt;/ref&gt; The seal was affixed to documents issued by the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] and its head the [[chief governor of Ireland|chief governor]] (latterly called the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]]). In the fifteenth century, the Chief Governor was generally non-resident and was represented by a [[Lord Deputy of Ireland|Lord Deputy]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood 1922, p.208&lt;/ref&gt; The Governor or Deputy would issue a type of [[writ]] called a [[fiant]] to the Lord Chancellor, mandating the issue of a patent ("[[letters patent]]") under the Great Seal.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 1922, p.217&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourteenth century, the Chancellor was entitled to a guard of six [[man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and twelve mounted archers, in part to protect the seal in his custody.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert 1865, pp.209–10; O'Flanagan 1870, Vol.1 p.47&lt;/ref&gt; The Chief Governor was appointed in London under the Great Seal of England, but a 1498 Act allowed a vacancy to be temporarily filled by the Dublin administration under the Irish seal.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert 1865, pp.464–5&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was applied several times in the 1690s.&lt;ref name="jstor25506334p4"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sainty|first=J.

Before the [[Act of Union 1800]], any [[bill (law)|bill]] passed by the [[Parliament of Ireland]] and approved by the Privy Council of Ireland was sent to London under the Great Seal of Ireland and, if approved by the [[Privy Council of England]] (later the [[Privy Council of Great Britain]]), was returned under the Great Seal of the Realm to be [[enactment of a bill|enacted]].&lt;ref name="irparl1782"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gilbert455"&gt;Gilbert 1865, pp.455–6&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure was required both under [[Poynings' Law]] (1495) and under the [[Constitution of 1782]] which amended it.&lt;ref name="irparl1782"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestryireland.com/history-of-the-irish-parliament/background-to-the-statutes/the-constitutional-position/|title=Background to the Statutes &gt; The Constitutional Position|work=History of the Irish Parliament|publisher=Ulster Historical Foundation|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YelvertonsAct"/&gt; Parliament was summoned under the Great Seal of England rather than that of Ireland,&lt;ref name="gilbert455"/&gt; even after 1782.&lt;ref name="YelvertonsAct"&gt;{{cite book |title=Statutes Passed in the Parliaments Held in Ireland: 1782–1785 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4FRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA154 |accessdate=5 June 2015|year=1794|publisher=George Grierson, printer to the King's Most Excellent Majesty |pages=154–5 |chapter=21 &amp; 22 George III c.47: An Act to regulate the Manner of passing Bills, and to prevent Delays in summoning of Parliament }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
An [[Court of Chancery (Ireland)|Irish chancery]] was established in 1232 separate from the [[Court of Chancery|English chancery]], and all documents issued from the Irish chancery were sealed with the "great seal of the king used in Ireland".&lt;ref name="CIRCLEintro"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chancery.tcd.ie/content/irish-chancery-rolls|title=The Irish Chancery Rolls|work=CIRCLE: A Calendar of Irish Chancery Letters c.1244–1509|publisher=Department of History, Trinity College Dublin|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most thirteenth-century land grants continued to be issued in England with the English seal, and then sent to the Irish chancery to be enrolled.&lt;ref name="CIRCLEintro"/&gt; In 1256, King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] granted the Lordship of Ireland to his heir, the future [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], and ordered that Edward's personal seal should have "royal authority" there.&lt;ref name="gilbert103"&gt;Gilbert 1865, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Studd2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Studd|first=J.

In 1417, the Chancellor, [[Laurence Merbury]], refused to authenticate with the seal a petition to the King from the Parliament on the state of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert 1865, p.310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Statute Law Revision Act 2007; 1421 (9 Hen. 5) c. 5: "Complaint as to Sir Laurence Merbury, Chancellor, having refused to affix the Great Seal to a message for the King"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1423, the Chancellor [[Richard Talbot (archbishop of Dublin)|Richard Talbot, archbishop of Dublin]], refused to acknowledge Edward Dantsey, [[Bishop of Meath]], as Deputy because the Governor, [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]], had appointed Dantsey with his privy seal instead of the Great Seal.&lt;ref name="wood212"/&gt; In 1460, [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard of York]], under threat of arrest in England, fled to Ireland and persuaded the parliament to pass a [[declaration of independence]] stating in part that Ireland was "corporate of itself" and that "henceforth no person or persons being in the said land of Ireland shall be, by any command given or made under any other seal than the said seal of the said land, compelled to answer to any appeal or any other matter out of the said land".&lt;ref name="lydon1995popular"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lydon|first=James|date=Summer 1995|title=Ireland corporate of itself|journal=History Ireland|volume=3|issue=2|url=http://www.historyireland.com/medieval-history-pre-1500/ireland-corporate-of-itself/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert 1865, pp.367–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lydon1995scholarly"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lydon|first=James|date=May 1995|title=Ireland and the English Crown, 1171–1541|journal=Irish Historical Studies|publisher=Irish Historical Studies Publications|volume=29|issue=115|pages=290–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Deputy [[Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare]] refused [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]'s command to annul this, and it was not until [[Edward Poynings]] in 1495 that this was done.&lt;ref name="lydon1995scholarly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ireland1765"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ireland|first=|title=The Statutes at Large: From the third year of Edward the Second, A.D. 1310, to the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth years of James the First, A.D. 1612, inclusive |volume=Vol.1 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXhaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA57|accessdate=29 May 2015|year=1765|publisher=B.

In 1478, after Kildare was replaced as Lord Deputy by [[Henry Grey, 4th (7th) Baron Grey of Codnor]], the Lord Chancellor [[Rowland FitzEustace, 1st Baron Portlester]], who was Kildare's father-in-law, organised a campaign of non-co-operation with the new Deputy and refused to hand over the Great Seal, making the conduct of official business impossible. Kildare argued that Grey had been appointed under the privy [[Signet ring|signet]] instead of the Irish Great Seal.&lt;ref name="wood212"/&gt; King Edward IV ordered [[Thomas Archbold]], the Master of the [[Royal Mint]] in Ireland, to strike a new Great Seal, "as near as he could to the pattern and fabric of the other, with the difference of a rose in every part". The king decreed that the Seal held by Portlester was annulled, and that all acts passed under it under it were utterly void;&lt;ref&gt;Statute Law Revision Act 2007; 1478 (18 Edw. 4 sess. 3) c. 11: "All writs under the Great Seal to be void until Sir Roland Fitz Eustace restore it to the Lord Deputy; meanwhile a new seal to be made"&lt;/ref&gt; but to no avail.  So effective was the campaign of obstruction that after a few months Lord Grey was forced to return to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Otway-Ruthven|first=Annette Jocelyn|title=A History of Medieval Ireland|year=1980|publisher=E.

One of the developments which [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and the [[Tudor Reconquest of Ireland]] sought to reverse was that the Lord Deputy's private seal, kept by his secretary, was being used in place of the Great Seal of Ireland.&lt;ref name="Ellis2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Steven G.|title=Ireland in the Age of the Tudors, 1447–1603: English Expansion and the End of Gaelic Rule|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXPXAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=2 June 2015|date=17 June 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317901433|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1638, Lord Chancellor [[Adam Loftus, 1st Viscount Loftus|Adam Loftus]] refused to kneel before Lord Deputy [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth]] when delivering the Great Seal to him, contributing to the breakdown in their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Dougal|date=June 2006|title=Thomas Wentworth and Monarchical Ritual in Early Modern Ireland|journal=The Historical Journal|publisher=Cambridge University Press  |jstor=4091618|volume=49|issue=2|pages=331–355: 349, fn.57}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1662, the fee to the Lord Chancellor for patents under the Great Seal was increased to 10 [[Shilling (English coin)|shilling]]s [[Pound sterling|sterling]] per patentee.&lt;ref name="Ireland1794"&gt;{{cite book|title=Statutes Passed in the Parliaments Held in Ireland|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=ymlBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA610|accessdate=26 August 2016|volume=I: 1310–1662|year=1794|publisher=G.

The [[Constitution of 1782]] removed the role of the British great seal in Irish legislation. [[Napper Tandy]] of the [[Society of United Irishmen]] challenged his 1792 arrest on the grounds that government officials, from the Lord Lieutenant down, had been appointed under the British rather than the Irish seal. This was intended not to persuade the judges, who vehemently rejected the argument, but to increase public sympathy.&lt;ref name="Coughlan1976"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coughlan|first=Rupert J.|title=Napper Tandy|year=1976|publisher=Anvil Books|isbn=9780900068348|pages=89–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Act of Union 1800]] provided that the Great Seal of Ireland could continue to be used in Ireland, and that at [[UK general election|elections to the Westminster parliament]] for constituencies in Ireland, the [[writ of election|writs]] and certified returns would be under the Irish rather than the British seal.&lt;ref&gt;Act of Union (Ireland) 1800, Article 8, sections 8 and 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

(On the accession of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] in 1377, the seal of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] was re-used to save money, with only the king's name being updated.&lt;ref name="gilbert243"&gt;Gilbert 1865, p.243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Flanagan 1870, Vol.1 p.48&lt;/ref&gt;) The seal included the [[arms of Ireland]]: until 1536, three crowns; after that, an [[Irish harp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dykes|first=David Wilmer|year=1966|title=The Anglo-Irish Coinage and the Ancient Arms of Ireland|journal=The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland|publisher=Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland|volume=96|issue=2|page=118|jstor=25509618}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From [[Queen Victoria]] on, the Great Seal of Ireland had the same design as the Great Seal of the Realm except for the inclusion of the Irish harp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mernick.org.uk/seals/other/greatsealireland.htm|title=Ireland|last=Mernick|first=Harold M|work=Great Seals of Britain|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1906/jun/27/great-seal-of-ireland|title=Great Seal of Ireland|date=27 June 1906|nopp=Y|work=Hansard HC Deb|pages=vol 159 cc940–1|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Roderick O'Flanagan described the contemporary seal in 1870:&lt;ref name="oflanagan1870v1p16"/&gt;

The villages of '''Großwilsdorf''' and the Rödel Plateau are situated in [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in the middle of [[Germany]].  It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]] is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called [[Landesausbau]] and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

=== Wilsdorf ===
The farming community of Gross-Wilsdorf consists of two [[villages]]. It is an example of a circular village structure in the [[Slav]]-[[Germans|German]] settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Namenkundliche Beiträge zur Siedlungsgeschichte des Saale- und Mittelelbegebietes bis zum Ende des 9. Jahrhunderts (Deutsch-Slawische Forschungen zur Namenkunde und Siedlungsgeschichte 26).|date=1971|publisher=Berlin|language=German|trans-title=The history of names in the settlement in the area of the Saale and the Elbeuntil the end of the 9th century (German-Slav research on the history of names and settlements 26).|author=Walter, Hans}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The entrance of the high medieval village was traditionally marked by a [[pond]]. This pond was kept for use as service water in everyday life and for fire fighting in cases of emergency. In the village of Gross-Wilsdorf, you can also find a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] choir tower church, which had been erected between the two high medieval settlement nucleuses of Gross-Wilsdorf and Kleinwilsdorf and which has partly been preserved. The [[tombstones]] of the church were ornamented with engraved crosses and a stick-like image deemed to be a walking stick. Since medieval tombstones in places other than large [[cathedral]]s and [[minsters]] have rarely been preserved, the tombstones in Gross-Wilsdorf can be considered special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1913|language=German|trans-title=On the history of the so-called ″circular villages" in the region of Naumburg.

[[File:Sandstone,_Saale-Unstrut.jpg|thumb|Sandstone, Saale-Unstrut]]
The villages of Großwilsdorf demonstrate the cultural exchange of neighboring [[settler]]s in the region, who all relied at first on their traditional settlement forms.  [[Sorbs]], [[Thuringians]], and other groups created three individual round villages in the [[12th century]], that all shared the same village church built right in the middle between these settlements.  During the [[High Middle Ages]] these settlers from different regions and ethnicities mixed and the villages grew together, forming nowaday Großwilsdorf. The layouts of houses and streets are still well preserved and dated to the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Siedlungsformen und -entwicklung – neue analytische, systematische und planungsrelevante Aspekte.|date=2012|language=German|trans-title=Forms of settlement and development - new analystical relevant aspects.|author=Liesenberg, Carsten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rödel ===

Adjoining the village lies the Rödel [[Plateau]] with its porous [[limestone]] layers. The important limestone quarry “Rödel” served for producing large-sized cut stones of highest quality and supplied the [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut|Naumburg Cathedral]] with building material. [[Neuenburg Castle]] was almost entirely built using the local shell limestone. Structural elements of higher quality were made using shell limestone from the surrounding quarries. This [[quarry]] also is visible and unchanged until today, as are the transport paths for the limestone to Naumburg.

In the year 1032, [[Conrad II|King Conrad II]] gave the royal court of Balgstädt to the Cathedral of Naumburg, including all accessories such as rocks and cliffs (molis). The monastery was granted the permission to dig out suitable rock material there freely, to break it up, roll it out and carry it away. The great number of pits identified by way of laser scans clearly reflect that there was likely a multitude of entitled parties and producers because of the highly fragmented nature of medieval stone [[quarrying]].  Parcels could be identified in the forests on the Rödel Plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geologie von Thüringen.|date=1974|publisher=Haack|pages=15–79|language=German|trans-title=Geology of Thuringia.|author=Seidel, Gerd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hasina''' is the concept of [[sanctity]] and imbued authority in the traditional culture of [[Madagascar]]. An individual is believed to be imbued with ''hasina'', which can be augmented or diminished by their actions or by the tribute or authority conceded to them by others. Rulers in traditional society were the ultimate embodiment of ''hasina'', whereas community leaders and heads of families possessed relatively less. The same term, ''hasina'', was used to describe tributes given to political leaders, which in the 19th century [[Kingdom of Imerina]] typically took the form of a silver coin and accompanying prayer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/divers4/010017390.pdf Hasina in Madagascar]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Horrors of Malformed Men'''''|江戸川乱歩全集　恐怖奇形人間|''Edogawa Rampo Zenshū: Kyoufu Kikei Ningen''}} is a 1969 Japanese [[horror film]] directed by [[Teruo Ishii]], who also co-wrote the film. It is based on the novels ''Strange Tale of Panorama Island'' (''パノラマ島奇談 Panorama-tō Kidan'') and ''The Demon of the Lonely Isle'' (孤島の鬼 ''Kotō no Oni'') by [[Edogawa Rampo]].

==Plot==
{{more plot|date=August 2018}}
Hirosuke (Teruo Yoshida), a medical student with almost no recollection of his past, is trapped in an asylum, despite being perfectly sane. After escaping from the loony bin, and being framed for the murder of a circus girl, he spots the photo of a recently deceased man, Genzaburo Komoda, to whom he bears an uncanny resemblance. By pretending to have been resurrected, Hirosuke assumes the dead man's identity, fooling everyone, including Komoda's widow and mistress. Whilst at the Komoda household, Hirosuke recalls memories that convince him to travel to a nearby island, home of Jogoro, the web-fingered father of Genzaburo. Whilst on the island, Hirosuke not only discovers Jogoro's plans to build his 'ideal community' (by transforming perfectly normal humans into hideous freaks), but also the awful truth behind his own identity.

'''''Idylls of the King''''', published between 1859 and 1885, is a [[Literature cycle|cycle]] of twelve [[narrative poem]]s by the English poet [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] (1809–1892; [[Poet Laureate]] from 1850) which retells the legend of [[King Arthur]], his knights, his love for [[Guinevere]] and her tragic betrayal of him, and the rise and fall of Arthur's kingdom. The whole work recounts Arthur's attempt and failure to lift up mankind and create a perfect kingdom, from his coming to power to his death at the hands of the traitor [[Mordred]]. Individual poems detail the deeds of various knights, including [[Lancelot]], [[Geraint]], [[Galahad]], and [[Sir Balin|Balin]] and [[Sir Balan|Balan]], and also [[Merlin]] and the [[Lady of the Lake]]. There is little transition between Idylls, but the central figure of Arthur links all the stories. The poems were dedicated to the late [[Albert, Prince Consort]].
The ''Idylls'' are written in [[blank verse]]. Tennyson's descriptions of nature are derived from observations of his own surroundings, collected over the course of many years. The dramatic narratives are not an [[Epic poetry|epic]] either in structure or tone, but derive [[elegy|elegiac]] sadness in the style of the [[idyll]]s of [[Theocritus]]. ''Idylls of the King'' is often read as an allegory of the societal conflicts in Britain during the mid-[[Victorian era]].

==Tennyson's sources and idealism==
Tennyson based his retelling primarily on Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' and the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', but with many expansions, additions, and several adaptations, a notable example of which is the fate of Guinevere. In Malory she is sentenced to be burnt at the stake but is rescued by [[Lancelot]]; in the ''Idylls'' Guinevere flees to a convent, is forgiven by Arthur, repents, and serves in the convent until she dies. Tennyson amended the traditional spellings of several names to fit the metre.

==Place of writing==
Part of the work was written in the Hanbury Arms in [[Caerleon]], where a plaque commemorates the event.

== Publishing chronology ==
The first set of ''Idylls'', "Enid", "Vivien", "Elaine", and "Guinevere", was published in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Tennyson |first=Alfred |year=1859 |title= Idylls of the King |publisher=Edward Moxon &amp; Co. |place=London |edition= 1 |page=  |url=https://books.google.bg/books?id=xXn6CZ2k3pQC&amp;pg=PP9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 March 2016}} via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;  "Enid" was later divided into "The Marriage of Geraint" and "Geraint and Enid", and "Guinevere" was expanded. ''The Holy Grail and Other Poems'' appeared ten years later. "The Last Tournament" was published in ''Contemporary Review'' in 1871. "Gareth and Lynette" was published the following year. The final idyll, "Balin and Balan", was published in ''Tiresias and Other Poems'' in 1885. The Dedication was published in 1862, a year after the Prince Consort had died; the epilogue, "To the Queen," was published in 1873.

== The Idylls ==
=== The Coming of Arthur ===
[[File:La Dame du Lac.jpg|thumb|The [[Lady of the Lake]] taking the infant [[Lancelot]], in the ''Idylls of the King'']]
The first of the Idylls covers the period following Arthur's coronation, his accession, and marriage. The besieged [[Leodegrance|Leodogran]], King of Cameliard, appeals to Arthur for help against the beasts and heathen hordes. Arthur vanquishes these and then the Barons who challenge his legitimacy. Afterwards he requests the hand of Leodogran's daughter, [[Guinevere]], whom he loves. Leodogran, grateful but also doubtful of Arthur's lineage, questions his chamberlain, Arthur's emissaries, and Arthur's half-sister [[Morgause|Bellicent]] (the character known as Anna or Morgause in other versions), receiving a different account from each. He is persuaded at last by a dream of Arthur crowned in heaven. [[Lancelot]] is sent to bring Guinevere, and she and Arthur wed in May. At the wedding feast, Arthur refuses to pay the customary tribute to the Lords from [[Roman Empire|Rome]], declaring, “The old order changeth, yielding place to new.” This phrase is repeated by Arthur throughout the work. Tennyson's use of the phrase in both the first and last Idyll, and throughout the work, is indicative of the change in Britain's, and Arthur's, fortunes. At this point, the phrase indicates the passing of Rome and the Heathens; In ''The Passing of Arthur'', it indicates the downfall of Arthur's kingdom.

=== Gareth and Lynette ===
Tennyson based "Gareth and Lynette" on the fourth ([[William Caxton|Caxton]] edition: seventh) book of Malory's ''Le Morte d'Arthur''. No version of the story earlier than Malory's is known; it is possible that Malory created the tale himself, though he may have relied on an older work that is now lost.

Of all the Idylls, “Gareth and Lynette” is sweetest and most innocent. [[Gareth]], Bellicent and [[King Lot|Lot]]'s last son, dreams of knighthood but is frustrated by his mother. After a lengthy argument she clinches the matter, or so she thinks, by ordering him to serve as an anonymous scullion in Arthur's kitchens for a year and a day. To her disappointment, he agrees. Upon his arrival incognito at [[Camelot]], Gareth is greeted by a disguised [[Merlin]], who tells him the city is never built at all, and therefore built forever, and warns him that Arthur will bind him by vows no man can keep. Gareth is angered by his apparent tomfoolery, but is himself rebuked for going disguised to the truthful Arthur.

Arthur consents to the boy's petition for kitchen service. After Gareth has served nobly and well for a month, Bellicent repents and frees him from his vow. Gareth is secretly knighted by Arthur, who orders Lancelot to keep a discreet eye on him. Gareth's first quest comes in the form of the cantankerous [[Lynette and Lyonesse|Lynette]], who begs Arthur for Lancelot's help in freeing her sister Lyonors. Rather than Lancelot, she is given Gareth, still seemingly a kitchen servant. Indignant, she flees, and abuses Gareth sorely when he catches up. On their journey he proves himself again and again, but she continues to call him knave and scullion. Gareth remains courteous and gentle throughout. Throughout the journey to the Castle Perilous, he overthrows the soi-disant knight of the Morning Star, knight of the Noonday Sun, knight of the Evening Star, and finally the most terrible knight of Death, who is revealed as a boy coerced into his role by his older brothers. Tennyson concludes: “And he [Malory] that told the tale in older times / Says that Sir Gareth wedded Lyonors, / But he, that told it later [Tennyson], says Lynette.”

===Enid===
[[File:Idylls of the King 9.jpg|thumb|[[Gustave Doré|Doré]]'s illustration "[[Geraint]] and [[Enide|Enid]] Ride Away"]]

"Enid" was initially written as a single poem but was later divided into two parts: "The Marriage of Geraint" and "Geraint and Enid". It is based on one of the [[Three Welsh Romances|Welsh Romances]], ''[[Three Welsh Romances#Geraint and Enid|Geraint and Enid]]'', of the ''[[Mabinogion]]''.

==== The Marriage of Geraint ====
[[Geraint]], tributary prince of Devon and one of Arthur's bravest knights, is married to [[Enide|Enid]], the only daughter of Yniol. He loves his wife deeply and she responds with equal affection; her only wish is to please him. At this time, the first rumours about Lancelot and Guinevere begin to spread throughout the court, but as yet there is no proof that any romance really exists. Geraint believes the stories and begins to fear that Enid will follow the bad example of her friend, the queen. His worries begin to plague him and he finally asks Arthur's permission to return to Devon.

After they arrive home, Geraint is very affectionate and attentive to his wife. He totally neglects his duties as a ruler and a knight, for he is obsessed with the idea that Enid has left a lover behind at the palace. Made suspicious by his jealousy, he stays at Enid's side at all times. Before long, Geraint's reputation begins to suffer. His people secretly scoff at him and jeer that his manliness is gone. Enid also is upset by his new and disgraceful way of life, but she is afraid to criticise him since she does not want to cause him any pain.

One morning as they lie in bed, she muses out loud about her sad dilemma and berates herself as a bad wife for remaining silent. Geraint awakens and overhears her last few words. He jumps to the conclusion that she is confessing her infidelity and is infuriated. He angrily shouts that he is still a warrior, despite all rumours, and that he will at once go on a quest to prove his prowess. She alone is to accompany him, taking no baggage and wearing her oldest and most shabby dress.

==== Geraint and Enid ====
Geraint and Enid set out on their journey that very morning. Geraint orders Enid to ride in front of him and not to speak, whatever the provocation. Perhaps, Tennyson hints, this command is because he still loves her and is afraid that in some outburst of his brooding jealousy he will harm her. The two ride on slowly into the bandit-infested wilderness adjoining Devon. Neither speaks, and both look pale and unhappy.

After a while, Enid notices three knights and overhears them planning to attack Geraint. He is riding so listlessly that he inspires no fear in them. She does not wish to disobey his order to her, but is afraid that he might be harmed. Finally she rides back and warns him. Rather than show any gratitude, Geraint criticises Enid for her disobedience and needles her about his suspicion that she really wants him to be defeated. Geraint engages the knights and is victorious. He piles the armour of the dead knights on their horses and makes Enid lead them as she rides.

The same episode is repeated again with three other knights, and once more Geraint chastises Enid for her disobedience. He is triumphant in each fight. Now Enid is forced to lead six captured horses. Geraint has some sympathy for her difficulty handling them, but does not offer to help.

In the afternoon, Geraint and Enid dine with some farm workers and are then guided to an inn for the night. After arranging for accommodations, Geraint continues to be sullen and nasty. Later that evening, they are visited at the inn by the local ruler, Earl Limours, who, by chance, happens to have once been a suitor of Enid's. Limours is a crude drunkard, and Geraint callously allows him to make all sorts of coarse jokes, much to the distress and embarrassment of Enid. Before leaving for the night, Limours informs Enid that he still loves her and plans the next morning to rescue her from her cruel husband.

When day breaks, Enid warns Geraint of the plot. He, of course, suspects her of having encouraged the earl and is angry. They leave the inn immediately but are pursued by Limours and his followers. In a running fight, Geraint is able to drive them off.

Soon the unhappy couple enters the lawless territory of Earl Doorm the Bull. Suddenly Geraint collapses from his wounds. Enid is powerless to aid him and she sits by his side, weeping while he lies unconscious. After a while, Doorm and his soldiers ride past, returning from a raid. The outlaw earl's curiosity is aroused by the lovely maiden and he questions her. Doorm insists that the wounded knight is dead, but Enid refuses to believe him. The outlaw chieftain has his soldiers bring Geraint's body and Enid to his stronghold.

As they gallop off together on one horse, they meet Edyrn, son of Nudd. He informs them that he is an advance scout for an army led by Arthur to rid this province of thieves and outlaws. He offers to guide them to the king's camp where Geraint reports to Arthur. After Geraint is shamed by the praise Arthur gives him, he and Enid are reconciled in their tent. When Geraint is well again they all return to Caerleon. Later on, the happy couple returns to Devon. Geraint's chivalrous and commendable behaviour as ruler and knight ends all rumours about him.

=== Balin and Balan ===
"Balin and Balan" is based on the tale of [[Sir Balin]] in Book II of ''Le Morte d'Arthur''. Malory's source was the [[Old French]] [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]], specifically the text known as the ''Suite du Merlin''.

The brothers Sir Balin "the Savage" and [[Sir Balan|Balan]] return to Arthur's hall after three years of exile, and are welcomed warmly. When Arthur's envoys return, they report the death of one of Arthur's knights from a demon in the woods. Balan offers to hunt the demon, and before he departs warns Balin against his terrible rages, which were the cause of their exile. Balin tries to learn gentleness from Lancelot, but despairs and concludes that Lancelot's perfect courtesy is beyond his reach. Instead, he takes the Queen's crown for his shield. Several times it reminds him to restrain his temper.

Then, one summer morning, Balin beholds an ambiguous exchange between Lancelot and the Queen that fills him with confusion. He leaves Camelot and eventually arrives at the castle of [[Pellam]] and Garlon. When Garlon casts aspersions on the Queen, Balin kills him and flees. Ashamed of his temper, he hangs his crowned shield in a tree, where [[Lady of the Lake|Vivien]] and her squire discover it, and then Balin himself. She spins lies to Balin that confirm his suspicions about Guinevere. He shrieks, tears down his shield, and tramples it. In that same wood, Balan hears the cry and believes he has found his demon. The brothers clash and only too late recognise each other. Dying, Balan assures Balin that their Queen is pure and good.

=== Merlin and Vivien ===
Having boasted to [[Mark of Cornwall|King Mark]] that she will return with the hearts of Arthur's knights in her hand, [[Lady of the Lake|Vivien]] begs and receives shelter in Guinevere's retinue. While in Camelot, she sows rumours of the Queen's affair. She fails to seduce the King, for which she is ridiculed, and turns her attentions to Merlin. She follows him when he wanders out of Arthur's court, troubled by visions of impending doom. She intends to coax out of Merlin a spell that will trap him forever, believing his defeat would be her glory. She protests her love to Merlin, declaring he cannot love her if he doubts her. When he mentions Arthur's knights' gossip about her, she slanders every one of them. Merlin meets every accusation but one: that of Lancelot's illicit love, which he admits is true. Worn down, he allows himself to be seduced, and tells Vivien how to work the charm. She immediately uses it on him, and so he is imprisoned forever, as if dead to anyone but her, in a hollow, nearby oak tree.

=== Lancelot and Elaine ===
"Lancelot and Elaine" is based upon the story of [[Elaine of Astolat]], found in ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', the [[Lancelot-Grail]] Cycle, and the Post-Vulgate Cycle. Tennyson had previously treated a similar subject in "[[The Lady of Shalott]]", published in 1833 and revised in 1842; however, that poem was based on the thirteenth-century Italian novella ''Donna do Scalotta'', and thus has little in common with Malory's version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/tennyson/los1.html|title="The Lady of Shalott"|website=Victorianweb.org|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long ago, Arthur happened upon the skeletons of two warring brothers, one wearing a crown of nine diamonds. Arthur retrieved the crown and removed the diamonds. At eight annual tourneys, he awarded a diamond to the tournament winner. The winner has always been Lancelot, who plans to win once more and give all nine diamonds to his secret love Queen Guinevere. Guinevere chooses to stay back from the ninth tournament, and Lancelot then tells Arthur he too will not attend. Once they are alone, she berates Lancelot for giving grounds for slander from court and reminds Lancelot that she cannot love her too-perfect king, Arthur. Lancelot then agrees to go to the tournament, but in disguise. He borrows armour, arms and colours from a remote noble, the Lord of [[Astolat]], and as a finishing touch, agrees to wear Astolat's daughter Elaine's token favour, which he has never done "for any woman". Lancelot's flattering chivalry wins over the impressionable young Elaine's heart. Here the Idyll repeats [[Elaine of Astolat|Malory's account]] of the tournament and its aftermath.

Elaine has thus fallen in love with Lancelot. When he tells her that their love can never be, she wishes for death. She later becomes weak and dies. As per her request, her father and brothers put her on a barge with a note to Lancelot and Guinevere. Lancelot has returned to Camelot to present the nine diamonds to Guinevere. In an unwarranted jealous fury, the Queen hurls the diamonds out the window into the river, just as Elaine's funeral barge passes below. This is fulfilling of a dream Elaine spoke of in which she held the ninth diamond, but it was too slippery to hold and fell into a body of water. Elaine's body is brought into the hall and her letter read, at which the lords and ladies weep. Guinevere privately asks Lancelot's forgiveness. The knight muses that Elaine loved him more than the Queen, wonders if all the Queen's love has rotted to jealousy, and wishes he was never born.

=== The Holy Grail ===
This Idyll is told in flashback by Sir [[Percival]]e, who had become a monk and died one summer before the account, to his fellow monk Ambrosius. His [[Dindrane|pious sister]] had beheld the [[Holy Grail|Grail]] and named [[Galahad]] her "knight of heaven", declaring that he, too, would behold it. One summer night in Arthur's absence, Galahad sits in the [[Siege Perilous]]. The hall is shaken with thunder, and a vision of the covered Grail passes the knights. Percivale swears that he will quest for it a year and a day, a vow echoed by all the knights. When Arthur returns, he hears the news with horror. Galahad, he says, will see the Grail, and perhaps Percivale and Lancelot also, but the other knights are better suited to physical service than spiritual. The Round Table disperses. Percivale travels through a surreal, allegorical landscape until he meets Galahad in a hermitage. They continue together until Percivale can no longer follow, and he watches Galahad depart to a heavenly city in a boat like a silver star. Percival sees the grail, far away, not as close or real an image as Galahad saw, above Galahad's head. After the period of questing, only a remnant of the Round Table returns to Camelot. Some tell stories of their quests. Gawain decided to give up and spent pleasant times relaxing with women, until they were all blown over by a great wind, and he figured it was time to go home. Lancelot found a great, winding staircase, and climbed it until he found a room which was hot as fire and very surreal, and saw a veiled version of the grail wrapped in samite, a heavy silk popular in the Middle Ages, which is mentioned several times throughout the Idylls. "The Holy Grail" is symbolic of the Round Table being broken apart, a key reason for the doom of Camelot.

=== Pelleas and Ettare ===
Tennyson's source for "Pelleas and Ettare" was again Malory, who had himself adapted the story from the Post-Vulgate Cycle.

In an ironic echo of "Gareth and Lynette", the young, idealistic [[Pelleas]] meets and falls in love with the lady Ettare. She thinks him a fool, but treats him well at first because she wishes to hear herself proclaimed the "Queen of Beauty" at the tournament. For Pelleas' sake, Arthur declares it a "Tournament of Youth", barring his veteran warriors. Pelleas wins the title and circlet for Ettare, who immediately ends her kindness to him. He follows her to her castle, where for a sight of her he docilely allows himself to be bound and maltreated by her knights, although he can and does overthrow them all. [[Gawain]] observes this one day with outrage. He offers to court Ettare for Pelleas, and for this purpose borrows his arms and shield. When admitted to the castle, he announces that he has killed Pelleas.

Three nights later, Pelleas enters the castle in search of Gawain. He passes a pavilion of Ettare's knights, asleep, and then a pavilion of her maidens, and then comes to a pavilion where he finds Ettare in Gawain's arms. He leaves his sword across their throats to show that, if not for Chivalry, he could have killed them. When Ettare wakes, she curses Gawain. Her love turns to Pelleas, and she pines away. Disillusioned with Arthur's court, Pelleas leaves Camelot to become the Red Knight in the North.

=== The Last Tournament ===
Guinevere had once fostered an infant found in an eagle's nest, who had a ruby necklace wrapped around its neck. After the child died, Guinevere gave the jewels to Arthur to make a tournament prize. However, before the tournament, a mutilated peasant stumbles into the hall. He was tortured by the [[Red Knight]] in the North, who has set up a parody of the Round Table with lawless knights and harlots. Arthur delegates the judging of the Tournament to Lancelot and takes a company to purge the evil. "The Tournament of the Dead Innocence" becomes a farce, full of discourtesies, broken rules, and insults. Sir [[Tristran|Tristram]] wins the rubies. Breaking tradition, he rudely declares to the ladies that the "Queen of Beauty" is not present. Arthur's fool, [[Dagonet]], mocks Tristram. In the north, meanwhile, Arthur's knights, too full of rage and disgust to heed their King, trample the Red Knight, massacre his men and women, and set his tower ablaze.

Tristram gives the rubies to [[Iseult#Iseult of Ireland|Queen Isolt]], Mark's wife, who is furious that he has married [[Iseult#Iseult of Brittany|Isolt of Brittany]]. They taunt each other, but at the last he puts the necklace about her neck and bends to kiss her. At that moment Mark rises up behind him and splits his skull.

=== Guinevere ===
Guinevere has fled to the convent at Almesbury. On the night that she and Lancelot had determined to part forever, [[Mordred]], tipped off by Vivien, watched and listened with witnesses to their farewells. Guinevere rejects Lancelot's offer of sanctuary in his castle overseas, choosing instead to take anonymous shelter in the convent. She is befriended by a little novice. But when rumours of war between Arthur and Lancelot and Mordred's usurpation reach the convent, the novice's careless chatter pricks the Queen's conscience. She describes to Guinevere the glorious kingdom in her father's day, "before the coming of the sinful Queen."

The King comes. She hears his steps and falls on her face. He stands over her and grieves over her, himself, and his kingdom, reproaches her, and forgives her. She watches him leave and repents, hoping they will be reunited in heaven. She serves in the abbey, is later chosen Abbess, and dies three years later.

===The Passing of Arthur===
This section of the ''Idylls'' is a much expanded and altered version of Thomas Malory's ''Morte d'Arthur''.

In the disastrous last battle, Arthur kills [[Mordred]], and, in turn, receives a mortal wound. The entire Round Table has been killed with the exception of Sir [[Bedivere]], who carries the King to a church ([[Avalon]]), where Arthur first received [[Excalibur]] from the [[Lady of the Lake]]. Arthur orders Bedivere to throw the sword into the lake to fulfill a prophecy written on the blade. Sir Bedivere resists twice, but on the third time obeys and is rewarded by the sight of an arm "clothed in white [[samite]], mystic, wonderful" rising from the water to catch the sword. This was the Lady of the Lake. Sir Bedivere returns to Arthur in the church and tells him what he saw. Arthur believes him and passes with Sir Bedivere watching, as the new sun rises on a new year.

==Allegory for Victorian society==
Tennyson sought to encapsulate the past and the present in the ''Idylls.''  Arthur in the story is often seen as an embodiment of Victorian ideals; he is said to be "ideal manhood closed in real man" and the "stainless [[gentleman]]."  Arthur often has unrealistic expectations for the Knights of the Round Table and for Camelot itself, and despite his best efforts he is unable to uphold the Victorian ideal in his Camelot.  ''Idylls'' also contains explicit references to [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] interiors, [[Romanticism|Romantic]] appreciations of nature, and anxiety over [[gender role]] reversals—all pointing to the work as a specifically Victorian one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tucker, Herbert F.|title="The Epic Plight of Troth in Idylls of the King."|journal=ELH|volume=58|date=1991|pages=701–720|jstor=2873461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Victorian age there was a renewed interest in the idea of [[courtly love]], or the finding of spiritual fulfilment in the purest form of romantic love. This idea is embodied in the relationship between Guinevere and Arthur in the poem especially; the health of the state is blamed on Guinevere when she does not live up to the purity expected of her by Arthur as she does not sufficiently serve him spiritually. Tennyson's position as [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|poet laureate]] during this time and the popularity of the ''Idylls'' served to further propagate this view of women in the Victorian age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ahern, Stephen|title="Listening to Guinevere:  Female Agency and the Politics of Chivalry in Tennyson’s Idylls." |journal=Studies in Philology|volume=101|date=2004|pages=88–112|jstor=4174780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imigongo''' ({{IPA-rw|imiɡoːŋɡo|Kinyarwanda:}}) is an [[art form]] popular in [[Rwanda]] traditionally made by women using [[cow dung]]. Often in the colors black, white and red, popular themes include spiral and geometric designs that are painted on walls, pottery, and canvas. 

The images are produced using cow dung which is put onto wooden boards in spiral and geometric designs.  The dung is left to harden and is then decorated using colours made from organic material. The traditional colours are black, white, red, grey and beige-yellow but increasingly other colours are used.

The imigongo images were originally found in [[Kibungo]] inside the walls of huts as "magical" decorations during the 18th century.

During the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide|Genocide]] the skills involved almost disappeared. However, a women's cooperative on the road to [[Rusumo, Rwanda|Rusumo]] in the [[Eastern Province, Rwanda|Eastern Province]] near [[Kirehe]] has rescued and revived this uniquely Rwandan art form.  Traditionally geometric designs are produced but as the women artists have grown in confidence they have begun to experiment with more modern, innovative images that convey the spirit of the Rwandan landscape, its flora and fauna and its people.

{{Yishuv haYashan}}

'''Jacob Saphir''' (1822&amp;ndash;1886) ({{lang-he|יעקב הלוי ספיר}}) was a [[Meshulach]] and [[travel]]er of [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jewish]] descent, born in [[Ashmyany]], government of [[Wilna]].

While still a boy, he went to Ottoman [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] with his parents, who settled at [[Safed]], and at their death in 1836, he moved to [[Jerusalem]]. In 1848, he was commissioned by the Jewish community of the latter city to travel through the southern countries to collect alms for the poor of Jerusalem. In 1854 he undertook a second tour to collect funds for the construction of the [[Hurva Synagogue]] in the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]], which led him in 1859 to [[Yemen]], [[British India]], [[Egypt]], and [[Australia]].

The result of this journey was his momentous ethnographic work, ''`Even Sapir'',&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Saphir, ''Iben Safir'' (vol. 1 &amp; 2) Lyck 1866 (Hebrew). [Yesovev ʼAdmat Ḥam (masaʼ Miṛayim) Yam Suf, Ḥadre Teman, Mizraḥ Hodu kulo, ʼErets ha-ḥadashah ʼOsṭralya u-teshuvato ha-ramatah Yėrushalayim. ha-ʼAratsot ʼasher sovavti ṿe-tarti ... matsav ṿe-toʼ ar aḥenu ... ṿeha-mosaʻot ʼotam me-az ʻad ha-yom, ṿe-nilṿah ʼelehem sipurim ṿe-ʻinyanim toranim ṿa-ḥaḳirot ṿe-heʻarot ... ṿe-tsiyune ṿe-reshimot matsevot ʻatiḳot ... ṿe-shire ḳodesh ... / [meʼet] Yaʻaḳov Sapir ha-Leṿi']; Second edition published in Mainz in 1874&lt;/ref&gt; a travel diary in which he gave the history, and a vivid though uncritical description of the condition of the Jews in the above-mentioned countries. Saphir published also ''Iggeret Teman'' (Wilna, 1868, consciously titled after [[Rambam]]'s letter of centuries earlier), a work on the appearance in Yemen of the [[False Messiah|pseudo-Messiah]] [[Judah ben Shalom]], and which was largely responsible for ending Judah ben Shalom's career. Saphir died in Jerusalem in 1886.

Saphir was the first Jewish researcher to recognize the significance of the [[Cairo geniza]], as well as the first to publicize the existence of the [[Midrash ha-Gadol]], both later studied with great panache by [[Solomon Schechter]].

Sapir also did a lot of research and writings on [[Diamante citron|Yanover]], [[Balady citron|Israeli]] and [[Greek citron|Greek]] [[etrog]]s. He dedicated a collection of poetry to [[Moses Montefiore|Sir Moses and Lady Montefiore]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld, Hartwig; Montefiore Library. Jews' College. (1904).

'''Katharine Peabody Loring''' (May 21, 1849&amp;nbsp;– August 16, 1943) was an American educator. She was head of the history department at the [[Society to Encourage Studies at Home]], the first [[correspondence school]] in the United States, where she developed a lifelong companionship with well-known [[Diary|diarist]] [[Alice James]].{{sfn|James|James|1997|p=99}}{{sfn|Strouse|2011|p=164}} She was also a trustee of the [[Beverly, Massachusetts|Beverly Public Library]] in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]], and president of the [[Beverly Historical Society]] from 1918 to 1941.

== Early life ==
[[File:From left to right, Katharine Peabody, William Caleb, Louisa Putnam and Augustus Peabody Loring.jpg|thumb|left|From left to right: Katharine Peabody, William Caleb, Louisa Putnam and Augustus Peabody Loring.]]

Katharine Peabody Loring was born in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]], on May 21, 1849, to Caleb William Loring, president of the Plymouth Cordage Company, and Elizabeth Peabody.{{sfn|James|James|1997|p=536}} Her name was occasionally misspelled as Katherine in many letters.{{sfn|James|James|1997|pp=135–313}} The Loring family were descendants of [[Thomas Loring]], who came to [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham, MA]], from Devonshire, England, and they were influential in Massachusetts. Her grandfather Charles Greeley Loring was a landowner in [[Prides Crossing, Beverly, Massachusetts]], which was passed on to Loring's father, Caleb, who built a new house in 1852. The family often moved between the Prides Crossing home, Burnside, and the family house in Boston until 1872, when they all moved permanently to Beverly.{{sfn|Strouse|2011|p=164}}

In the spring of 1888, while travelling to Florida and South Carolina with her father and sister, Loring met [[Annie Adams Fields]] and [[Sarah Orne Jewett]], with whom she was a lifelong friend.&lt;ref name="Jewett"&gt;{{cite web|title=Correspondence of Sarah Orne Jewett|url=http://www.public.coe.edu/~theller/soj/let/Corresp/1-persons.html|website=Coe College department|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As educator ==
[[File:Study in Greens.jpg|thumb|Katharine (reading) and Louise Loring in Study in Greens, by John Singer Sargent, inscribed "To my friend Miss Louisa Loring, Prides Crossing, October, 1917." The original was destroyed by a fire in 1969.]]

Despite lacking formal education, Loring was an avid reader and travelled widely, unusual for women at the time.{{sfn|Strouse|2011|p=164}} Both her brothers, William Caleb Loring, a [[judge|justice]] of [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], and Augustus Peabody Loring, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician and member of the Constitutional Convention of 1917, often consulted with her.{{sfn|Strouse|2011|p=164}}

Because of her interest in politics and foreign affairs, Loring helped [[Anna Ticknor]] found the [[Society to Encourage Studies at Home]] in 1873 to contribute to women's education. She became head of the history department, the largest of the society's departments, a position she held for 20 years. Her sister, Louisa Putnam Loring, also helped out at the school. Louisa suffered from [[tuberculosis]] and often had to be taken care of by Loring. Loring and her sister were involved in the [[American Red Cross]] locally together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loring family. Papers of the Loring family, 1830–1943: A Finding Aid|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00151|publisher=Harvard University Library|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--this hastily(?) added ref still does not support all preceding info--&gt; Louisa was also a good friend of [[John Singer Sargent]] who took a watercolor of Louisa and Katharine Loring, ''Study in Green'', destroyed by fire in 1969.{{sfn|Strouse|2011|p=164}}

In 1871 Katharine Loring, together with [[Julia Ward Howe]], founded the [[Saturday Morning Club]], an organization for women's communal and intellectual growth in Boston.{{sfn|Strouse|2011|p=164}}&lt;ref name="Radcliffe Institute"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Saturday Morning Club of Boston|url=https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/schlesinger-library/blog/saturday-morning-club-boston|website=Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study|publisher=Radcliffe Institute|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to women's organizations, Loring was also a key stakeholder for the establishment of the [[Beverly, Massachusetts|Beverly Public Library]], of which she was also a trustee;{{sfn|Beverly Historical Society|2010|p=43}} other organizations she was involved with were: the Mayflower Club in Boston, the [[Royal Red Cross]] during World War I, the Women's Education Association, the [[Radcliffe College|Harvard Annex]] (a private program for the instruction of women by Harvard faculty),&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/12/29/101911635.pdf Obituary of Arthur Gilman, founder of Radcliffe College, The New York Times, Dec. 29, 1909]&lt;/ref&gt; the Beverly Improvement Society and the Massachusetts Library Club. She was also president of the [[Beverly Historical Society]] for 23 years, from 1918 to 1941, advocating the acquisition of the [[John Balch House]] and the [[John Hale House]], both properties currently in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].{{sfn|Beverly Historical Society|2010|p=43}}

== Influence on Alice James ==
[[File:Alice James (reclining) and Katharine Loring, taken at the Royal Leamington Spa (England), c. 1890.jpg|thumb|Alice James (reclining) and Katharine Peabody Loring, taken at the Royal Leamington Spa (England), c. 1890]]

{{see also|Alice James}}

Loring and James first met in December 1873. In 1875, James joined the Society and taught history alongside Loring, who was the head of the department.{{sfn|Fisher|2013|p=334}} In the summer of 1879, Alice James wrote to Sara Darwin: {{quote|"I wish you could know Katharine Loring [...] she is a most wonderful being. She has all the mere brute superiority which distinguishes man from woman combined with all the distinctively feminine virtues. There is nothing she cannot do from hewing wood and drawing water to driving runaway horses and educating all the women in North America".{{sfn|Novick|2011|p=327}}}}

Loring and James journeyed to the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] in New Hampshire in the spring of 1880. During the journey they also visited [[Lake Winnepesaukee]], [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and [[Cape Cod]].{{sfn|Complete Letters of Henry James|2016|p=xli}} On May 21, 1881, Loring and James left for England, arriving on May 30. Initially staying in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] at the Star and Garter Hotel, on July 18 they moved temporarily to [[Kew]] to the house of [[Asa Gray]], a [[Harvard]] botanist, and Jane Loring Gray, Loring's aunt. The Kew arrangements were unsuitable to James' needs, and they relocated to [[Sevenoaks]] at the end of July, and London, at 10 Clarges Street, in mid-August. In the beginning of September, with Henry James leaving for Scotland, James and Loring moved to his rooms at 4 Bolton Street. At the end of the month, they were back to the United States. Loring and James moved to England in 1884. James died on March 6, 1892.{{sfn|Complete Letters of Henry James|2016|p=xli}}

According to [[Leon Edel]], Henry James loosely based his characters Olive Chancellor and Verena Tarrant in ''[[The Bostonians]]'' upon Loring and his sister.{{sfn|Edel|2008|pp=308–314}}

== Later life ==
[[File:Katharine Peabody Loring and unidentified friend, c. 1890.jpg|right|thumb|Katharine Peabody Loring (left) and unidentified friend, c. 1890]]

At the beginning of the 20th century, when the [[nouveau riche]] arrived to Beverly from New York, they started to buy the old-Bostonian family mansions. [[Henry Clay Frick]] proposed to Katharine Loring to buy their Prides Crossing property, to which Loring replied, "Goodness! what on earth would I do with a million dollars?"{{sfn|Moore|2009|p=137}}

The Loring sisters participated in humanitarian activities throughout World War I.{{sfn|Beverly Historical Society|2010|p=43}} They also did relief work after the [[Great Salem fire of 1914]] and were active in combatting tuberculosis: Louise Loring was the founder and president of the [[Aiken, South Carolina]] Sanitarium, director of the Beverly Hospital, and founder of the Anti-Tuberculosis Society in Beverly.{{sfn|Pope|1917|p=264}}{{sfn|Beverly Historical Society|2010|p=43}} In 1917, Katharine helped compile the Loring family genealogy and in 1932 she wrote ''The Earliest Summer Residents of the North Shore and Their Houses''.&lt;ref name="Jewett" /&gt;

Always low-sighted, Katharine Loring became completely blind in old age, and taught herself [[braille]]. She died 94 years old, on August 16, 1943.{{sfn|Strouse|2011|p=164}} She was buried with her sister Louisa, who died earlier in 1924, at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Katharine Loring Born: Unknown Died: 11/26/1943 Burial Date: 11/26/1943 Path: Holly Path Lot: 3904|url=http://mountauburn.org/|website=Mount Auburn Cemetery|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Nihongo|'''''Kokumin-fuku'''''|国民服||}} (literally: "national uniform") was the European-style men's civil attire introduced in [[Japan]] in 1940 during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=更新日：2010年11月25日 |url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/horei_jp/kakugi/txt/txt00477.htm |title=戦時衣生活簡素化実施要綱 |publisher=Ndl.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616143836/http://www.ndl.go.jp/horei_jp/kakugi/txt/txt00477.htm |archivedate=2008-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2015/07/27/language/crash-course-wartime-japanese-terminology-foreign-demons "A crash course in wartime Japanese terminology for foreign demons"], ''[[Japan Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''live streaming of crimes''' is a phenomenon arising in the 2010s in which criminals deliberately commit crimes while [[live stream]]ing the act on [[social media]].

In April 2016, Marina Lonina (18) and Raymond Gates (29) were arrested in Ohio on charges that Gates raped an underage friend of Marina's while Lonina [[live-streamed]] the crime on [[Periscope (app)|Periscope]].&lt;ref name="McPhteLive"&gt;{{cite news

By May ''[[The New York Times]]'' was including the Ohio Periscope rape as one of a series of recent cases in which crimes were live streamed, including one in which a young woman in [[Égly]], France speaks via Periscope about her distress and suicidal thoughts and is apparently encouraged by viewers to kill herself, which she does by throwing herself under a train, and the case of two teenagers who live stream themselves bragging and laughing as they beat up a drunken man in a bar in [[Bordeaux, France]].&lt;ref name="Blaise"&gt;{{cite news

'''Stick charts''' were made and used by the Marshallese to [[navigate]] the [[Pacific Ocean]] by [[canoe]] off the coast of the [[Marshall Islands]]. The charts represented major [[swell (ocean)|ocean swell]] patterns and the ways the [[islands]] disrupted those patterns, typically determined by sensing disruptions in ocean swells by islands during sea navigation. Most stick charts were made from the midribs of coconut fronds that were tied together to form an open framework. Island locations were represented by shells tied to the framework, or by the lashed junction of two or more sticks. The threads represented prevailing [[ocean surface wave]]-crests and directions they took as they approached islands and met other similar wave-crests formed by the ebb and flow of breakers. Individual charts varied so much in form and interpretation that the individual navigator who made the chart was the only person who could fully interpret and use it. The use of stick charts ended after [[World War II]] when new electronic technologies made navigation more accessible and travel among islands by canoe lessened.

==Significance of stick charts to the history of cartography==

The stick charts are a significant contribution to the history of [[cartography]] because they represent a system of [[map]]ping [[ocean swell]]s, which was never before accomplished. They also use different materials from those common in other parts of the world. They are an indication that ancient [[map]]s may have looked very different, and encoded different features from the earth, than the maps we use today.

The charts, unlike traditional [[map]]s, were studied and memorized prior to a voyage and were not consulted during a trip, as compared to traditional navigation techniques where consultation of a map is frequent and points and courses are plotted out both before and during navigation. Marshallese navigators used their senses and memory to guide them on voyages by crouching down or lying prone in the canoe to feel how the canoe was being pitched and rolled by underlying swells.

==Ocean swells recognized by Marshallese==

The Marshallese recognized four main ocean swells: the ''rilib'', ''kaelib'', ''bungdockerik'' and ''bundockeing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SiCCMB6xQJoC&amp;pg=PA404&amp;lpg=PA404#v=onepage|title=We, the Navigators: The Ancient Art of Landfinding in the Pacific|first=David|last=Lewis|author-link=David Henry Lewis|edition=Second|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1994|page=404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navigators focused on effects of islands in blocking swells and generating counterswells to some degree, but they mainly concentrated on [[refraction]] of swells as they came in contact with undersea slopes of islands and the bending of swells around islands as they interacted with swells coming from opposite directions. The four types of ocean swells were represented in many stick charts by curved sticks and threads.

===''Rilib'' swells===

The ''rilib'' swell is the strongest of the four ocean swells and was referred to as the "backbone" swell. It is generated by the northeast [[trade winds]] and is present during the entire year, even when they do not penetrate as far south as the Marshall Islands. Marshallese considered the ''rilib'' swells to come from the east, even though the angle of the winds as well as the impact of the ocean currents varied the swell direction.

===''Kaelib'' swells===

The ''kaelib'' swell is weaker than the ''rilib'' and could only be detected by knowledgeable persons, but it is also present year round.

===''Bungdockerik'' swells===

The ''bungdockerik'' is present year round as well and arises in the southwest. This swell is often as strong as the ''rilib'' in the southern islands.

===''Bundockeing'' swells===

The ''bundockeing'' swell is the weakest of the four swells, and is mainly felt in the northern islands.

==Stick chart categories==

The stick charts typically fall into three main categories:  ''mattang'', ''meddo'' (or ''medo''), and ''rebbelib'' (or ''rebbelith'').

===''Mattang'' charts===

The ''mattang'' stick chart was an abstract chart used for instruction and for teaching principles of reading how islands disrupt swells.

===''Meddo'' charts===

The ''meddo'' chart showed actual islands and their relative or exact positions.  ''Meddo'' charts also showed the direction of main deep ocean swells, the way the swells curved around specific islands and intersected with one another, and distance from a canoe at which an island could be detected. The ''meddo'' chart portrayed only a section of one of the two main island chains.

===''Rebbelib'' charts===

''Rebbelib'' charts portrayed the same information as a meddo chart, but the difference lies in inclusiveness of the islands.  ''Rebbelib'' charts, unlike ''meddo'' charts, included all or most of one or both chains of islands.

==Passing on stick chart knowledge==

Stick charts were not made and used by all Marshall Islanders. Only a select few rulers knew the method of making the maps, and the knowledge was only passed on from father to son. So that others could utilize the expertise of the navigator, fifteen or more canoes sailed together in a [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]], accompanied by a leader pilot skilled in use of the charts.

It was not until 1862 that this unique piloting system was revealed in a public notice prepared by a resident [[missionary]]. It was not until the 1890s that it was comprehensively described by a naval officer, [[Korvettenkapitän|Captain]]  Winkler of the [[Imperial German Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|language=German|journal=Marine-Rundschau|volume=10 (Juli bis Dezember)|year=1898|title=Ueber die in früheren Zeiten in den Marschall-Inseln gebrauchten Seekarten, mit einigen Notizen über die Seefahrt der Marschall-Insulaner im Allgemeinen|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_MIE_AAAAYAAJ#page/n619/mode/2up|last=

Malcolm|editor2-last=Lewis|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winkler had been the commander of the {{SMS|Bussard}}, stationed in 1896 in the Marshall Islands which, during that period, were under [[List of former German colonies|German rule]]; he subsequently described the system in an 1898 publication. Winkler became so intrigued by the stick charts that he made a major effort to determine navigational principles behind them and convinced the navigators to share how the stick charts were used.

A '''mia-mia''' is a temporary [[Shelter (building)|shelter]] made of bark, branches, leaves and grass used by some [[Indigenous Australians]]. The word is also used in [[Australian English]] to mean "a temporary shelter". It comes from the [[Wathaurong|Wada Wurrung]] language. The term is also used in New Zealand, where it is usually spelt ''mai-mai'' and has the slightly different meaning of a [[Waterfowl_hunting#Blinds|shelter or hide used by a duck-hunter]].

'''''Short Subject''''' (commonly known as ''Mickey Mouse in Vietnam'') is a [[16 mm film|16mm]] American underground animated short film. The director was Whitney Lee Savage (father of [[Adam Savage]], of ''[[MythBusters]]'' fame);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doctorow|first1=Cory|title=Mickey Mouse in Vietnam|url=http://boingboing.net/2013/06/22/mickey-mouse-in-vietnam.html|website=Boing Boing|accessdate=1 June 2016|date=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the producer and head designer was [[Milton Glaser]]. The short was produced under the auspices  of a studio named Max Cats and Whittesey Sledge Studios. It features the [[Disney]] character [[Mickey Mouse]] being shipped to Vietnam during [[Vietnam War|the war]]. Moments after arriving, he is shot dead. It was produced independently in 1969 and has a total running time of one minute.&lt;ref&gt;
John Grant, ''Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters: from Mickey Mouse to Hercules'', 3rd Edition, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; It received an award from the [[International Short Film Festival Oberhausen]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XPcSAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22mickey+mouse+in+vietnam%22 ''Filmmakers Newsletter''], vol. 4, p. 55 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;  The film was lost for many years until April 22, 2013 when a [[YouTube]] user uploaded the video.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/24/mickey-mouse-in-vietnam_n_3491245.html "Mickey Mouse In Vietnam: Anti-War Animation By Milton Glaser Shows Character's Sad Demise"], ''[[Huffington Post]]'', June 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Haglund, [http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/06/21/mickey_mouse_in_vietnam_watch_long_lost_1968_short_film_by_milton_glaser.html "Watch the Long Lost Anti-War Short 'Mickey Mouse in Vietnam'"], ''[[Slate (magazine)]]'', June 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18345">[[File:Monomacho's crown - circa 1042 Budapest.JPG|thumb|320px|The Monomachus Crown]]
The '''Monomachus Crown''' ({{lang-hu|Monomakhosz-korona}}) is a piece of engraved [[Byzantine]] goldwork, decorated with [[cloisonné]] enamel, in the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. It consists of seven gold plates depicting Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine IX Monomachus]], his wife [[Zoe Porphyrogenita|Zoe]], her sister [[Theodora (11th century)|Theodora]], two dancers and two [[allegory|allegorical figures]]. The piece has puzzling aspects that have long made it the subject of scholarly debate; it was probably made in [[Constantinople]] in 1042.

It was unearthed in 1860 by a farmer in what is now called [[Ivanka pri Nitre]] in [[Slovakia]], then Nyitraivánka in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Kiss, 62&lt;/ref&gt;  If it is a crown, it is, with the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] of a few decades later (also in Budapest), one of the only two Byzantine crowns to survive with the [[kamelaukion]] of [[Constance of Aragon]].&lt;ref name="Beckwith, 214"&gt;Beckwith, 214&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Crown of Konstantinos IX Monomakhos DSCF8087 09.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The central panel, depicting [[Constantine IX Monomachus]]]]

In 1860 a farmer near Nyitraivánka discovered the treasure while plowing. The objects passed to a member of the local landowning nobility, who sold them in four transactions to the Hungarian National Museum between 1861 and 1870, the last sale posthumously via a dealer named Markovits.  Also sold were the two smaller cloisonee medallions found with the crown plaques, with busts of the [[apostle]]s [[Simon Peter|Peter]] and [[Andrew]]. These medallions lack holes for nails, unlike the gold plates. In the view of Magda von Bárány-Oberschall and most scholars they almost certainly do not belong to the Monomachus Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Kiss, 60-64&lt;/ref&gt;

The general assumption was for long that the crown "seems almost certainly to be a female crown and was presumably a gift to the wife of a Hungarian king",&lt;ref name="Beckwith, 214"/&gt; or to the king himself. In 1045 the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] King [[Andrew I of Hungary|Andrew I]] married [[Anastasia of Kiev]],&lt;ref&gt;Also called Agmunda, she would become the mother of King [[Solomon, King of Hungary|Solomon]]&lt;/ref&gt; a daughter of Grand Prince [[Yaroslav the Wise]],&lt;ref name=nasurus&gt;Alexander Nasarenko&lt;!--Александр Васильевич Назаренко--&gt;, [http://www.europainstitut.hu/pdf/beg15/Nazarenko.pdf "Ungarn und Rus' um das Jahr 1000."]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF-Datei; 370&amp;nbsp;kB) in Ferenc Glatz (Ed.): ''Die ungarische Staatsbildung und Ostmitteleuropa.'' Europa Institut Budapest, Budapest 2002, {{ISBN|963-202-773-6}}, S. 199&lt;/ref&gt; whose brother [[Vsevolod I of Kiev|Vsevolod I]] had been married to Irene (Maria), a daughter of Constantine IX since 1046.&lt;ref name=nasurus/&gt;&lt;ref name=vacor&gt;Szabolcs de Vajay, [http://epa.oszk.hu/01500/01536/00007/pdf/UJ_1976_037-064.pdf "Corona Regia – Corona Regni – Sacra Corona."] (PDF-Datei; 2,56&amp;nbsp;MB) ''Ungarn-Jahrbuch. Zeitschrift für interdisziplinäre Hungarologie'', Band 7, 1976. S. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the traditional account, Andrew or his queen would have received the crown from Constantine IX at this juncture. He was in need of a new crown, since [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] had captured the original crown (supposedly donated to king [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]] by [[Pope Silvester II]] in 1000) from King [[Samuel Aba]] in 1045 after the [[Battle of Ménfő]] and had sent it back to [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=vacor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julius Grexa, "Die Probleme der ungarischen Königskrone." in Josef Gerhard Farkas (Ed.): ''Überlieferung und Auftrag. Festschrift für Michel de Ferdinandy zum sechzigsten Geburtstag.'' Pressler, Wiesbaden 1972, {{ISBN|3-87646-025-5}}, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;  According to popular legend this was the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]], or some version of it, though it seems unlikely that any elements of the present crown are that old.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josef Deér]] casts doubt on the idea that this original crown was made in Rome in ''Die heilige Krone Ungarns.'' Wien 1966, pp. 199-200; the oldest elements of the present Holy Crown are now usually dated to the 1070s.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Andrew, who had taken power near the end of September 1046, was first able to be crowned in February 1047 could by attributed to the need for a royal embassy to travel from Hungary to Constantinople and back in winter in order to bring the Manomachus crown to Hungary.&lt;ref name=vacor/&gt; In 1057 the young King [[Solomon of Hungary|Solomon]] was also crowned with this crown.&lt;ref name=vacor/&gt;  Other, very different, possibilities have been suggested and are covered below.

In 1057 Solomon was besieged by [[Geza I]] and escaped with the crown and treasure in the direction of [[Pozsony]] in order to seek the protection of his brother-in-law Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]]. Soldiers of Geza apprehended him as he was fording the [[Váh]] near Ivanka pri Nitre. Solomon had the treasure and the crown buried and barricaded himself behind the walls of Pozsony.&lt;ref name=vacor/&gt; When Henry IV launched an expedition in September 1074 to restore Solomon to the Hungarian throne, the army of the Emperor abandoned him and rode along the Valley of the Váh in the direction of [[Nitra]] and [[Šintava]]. Possibly this was a futile attempt to recover the buried crown near the ford of Ivanka pri Nitre.&lt;ref name=vacor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julius Grexa, '"Die Probleme der ungarischen Königskrone." In Josef Gerhard Farkas (Ed.): ''Überlieferung und Auftrag. Festschrift für Michel de Ferdinandy zum sechzigsten Geburtstag.''

== Description ==
[[File:Танцующая Девушка с короны Константина1.jpg|thumb|upright|Dancer with veil]]
The seven gold plates are 3.5&amp;nbsp;cm wide and between 10 and 4.5&amp;nbsp;cm tall. They have asymmetrically cut holes whose size and arrangement suggests that the plates were originally connected by a fabric or leather band. It is possible that remains of golden bands for connecting the plates were found.&lt;ref&gt;Magda von Bárány-Oberschall, "Konstantinos Monomachos császár koronája. The Crown of the Emperor Constantine Monomachos." Budapest 1937, pp. 86 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that the seven plates were fastened to a fabric cap. the coarse finish of the decoration, the low purity of the gold plates and the presence of errors in the depiction of the clothing and in the inscriptions are notable.&lt;ref name=kiss/&gt;

The central and largest plate shows Emperor Constantine IX Monomachus, who was Byzantine Emperor from 1042 to 1055. A Greek inscription on the panel reads: Κῶνστάντινος Αυτοκράτο&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ρ&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Ρομεον ο Μονομαχο&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ς&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, ''Constantine, [[Autokrator|Emperor]] of the Romans, the Monomachos''. On the plate to his right is his wife and on the plate to the left, her sister.  On the smaller panels to the right and left of the Empresses are two dancing female figures. The smallest plates depict the personifications of two [[Virtue]]s. The figures have [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] on their heads and (except for the Virtues) are surrounded by flowering vines, birds and [[cypress]]es.

The Emperor is depicted standing, with the ''[[labarum]]'' in his right hand and in his left the ''[[akakia]]'', a fabric pouch which held dust and symbolised the transience of the material world. The Emperor's crown is decorated at its peaks with three balls. The Empresses wear the same crown. They hold a sceptre in their inner hand and point to Emperor Constantine with their outer hand. He wears the ceremonial robes of a Byzantine ruler with [[ivy]] decoration and the ''[[loros]]'' and ''maniakion'', Byzantine symbols of rulership.&lt;ref name=mbomon&gt;Magda von  Bárány-Oberschall, ''Konstantinos Monomachos császár koronája.'' ''The Crown of the Emperor Constantine Monomachos.'' Budapest 1937 pp. 60–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[loros]]'' is a sash, richly decorated with gemstones, pearls and embroidery which wraps around the shoulders and hips. One end of the ''loros'' falls to his hem, the other is tied around it. The ''maniakion'' is a broad collar decorated with pearls and gemstones. The three members of the imperial family wear red shoes on their feet and stand atop a ''suppedion''. Both women wear the complete [[regalia]] of an Empress with the female version of the loros costume, including the shield-like ''thorakion'' hanging diagonally from a belt.&lt;ref name=mbomon/&gt; Zoe, who was 64 years old in 1042 is depicted in an idealised way as a young woman. Their inscriptions read: "Θέοδώρα ἡ ἐυσαιβεστατι Αυγουστα," ''Theodora the Most Pious [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' and "Ζώη οι ευσαιβαῖστάτη Αυγουστα," ''Zoe the Most Pious Augusta''. The Greek of both is full of errors.
[[File:Crown of Konstantinos IX Monomakhos DSCF8087 03.JPG|thumb|Personification of Humility (left) and Dancer (right)]]

The two smaller plates depicting dancing women are identical rather than symmetrical. Their backgrounds are also decorated with foliage, but they lack identifying inscriptions. The dancers wave their veils over their heads and bend their right leg sharply backwards.&lt;ref name=mbomon/&gt; The idea that they are professional dancers may be contradicted by the haloes on their heads, which indicates that they belong to the sacred realm.  However, sacred dancing is rare in Christianity, at least before the Renaissance, and the [[iconography]] is most unusual in a context to do with public imperial ceremony and coronation, where the Byzantines placed great stress on the emperor as God's agent on earth.&lt;ref name="Beckwith, 214"/&gt;

Two even smaller panels each depict a female figure with a halo on a plain golden background, with [[cypress]]es on either side of them, symbolising the [[Garden of Eden]]. According to their inscriptions they represent the Virtues of "η αλιθηα" (ἡ ἀλήθεια, Sincerity) and "η τα&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;π&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;ινοσις" (ἡ ταπείνωσις, Humility).&lt;ref name=mbomon/&gt; Sincerity holds a cross in one hand and points to her mouth, while Humility crosses her arms over her chest.

John Beckwith saw in the crown a change in style from the enamels of the previous century: "All the figures are visualized in terms of pattern rather than form; the sense of space and depth so typical of the tenth-century enamels has been jettisoned for intricate detail and superficial charm."&lt;ref name="Beckwith, 214"/&gt;

== Authenticity and function ==
In 1937 Magda von Bárány-Oberschall investigated the enameled gold plates. The size of the crown formed from the plates led her to argue that it had to be a Byzantine consort's crown from the eleventh century.&lt;ref name=mbomono&gt;Magda von Bárány-Oberschall: Konstantinos Monomachos császár koronája. The Crown of the Emperor Constantine Monomachos. Budapest 1937&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Crown of Konstantinos IX Monomakhos DSCF8087 06.JPG|thumb|The crown from behind]]
In 1994, the [[Greeks|Greek]] Byzantinist [[Nicolas Oikonomidès]] expressed the view that the Monomachus Crown might be a nineteenth-century forgery. He was led to this opinion by the plain design, coarse finish and the erroneous and unusual captions, when combined with the circumstances of the discovery and plausible models for a forgery. In all these respects the crown contrasts strongly with the Holy Crown of Hungary. He suspected the forger came from [[Venice]], without however being able to put a name to him.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Tinnefeld: [http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de/html/da512.htm Nicolas Oikonomidès, La couronne dite de Constantin Monomaque, Travaux et Mémoires (Centre de Recherche d'Histoire et Civilisation de Byzance) 12 (1994) S.  241–262,] ''Deutsches Archiv für Erforschung des Mittelalters Jahrgang'' 51. 1995, Heft 2, Besprechungen und Anzeigen, Nr. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article, "The State of Research into the Monomachos Crown and Some Further Thoughts,"&lt;ref name=kiss&gt;Etele Kiss, "The State of Research into the Monomachos Crown and Some Further Thoughts." in Olenka Z. Pevny (Ed.):  ''Perceptions of Byzantium and Its Neighbours (843–1261).'' New York 2000, {{ISBN|0-300-08929-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which addresses Nicolas Oikonomidès' theory in detail and largely argues against it, Etele Kiss of the Hungarian National Museum mentioned that the crown could have been made for the emperor, to be presented in a [[Roman Triumph|triumphal procession]], thus explaining the presence of the dancers, one area of debate.  Another problem is that the seven plates form a circle with a diameter of ca. 22&amp;nbsp;cm, too small even for a woman's head, and the plain plaques, lacking jewelled surrounds, are unlike other Byzantine crowns.

Already in 1997, Henry Maguire had argued that the plaques were intended to be sewn to a leather or cloth backing, and suggested a belt, for which there are some sources, or diadem.  He related the dancers to a "chorus of graces" supposed, at least in Byzantine [[rhetoric]], to form a ring around the emperor, dancing and singing his praises. The motifs of birds and plants are metaphors for the virtues of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, 210&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Timothy Dawson elaborated on these arguments, proposing that the crown was actually a ceremonial armband, a grand version of an ''[[Armilla (military decoration)|armilla]]'' given to soldiers as an [[Roman military decorations and punishments|award]].&lt;ref name=dawres&gt;Dawson&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[De Ceremoniis]]'' of [[Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos]] written a century earlier describes how the emperor was presented with a crown on returning after a victory, which he then wore on his right arm. Dawson suggested that the most likely recipients in Constantine IX's reign were Stephanos Pergamos, a court [[eunuch]] who was a surprising success as a general, for his victory over [[George Maniakes]] at the Battle of Ostrobos on 2 February 1043, or the emperor himself on the same occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, 188-189&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Psellos]] records that the emperor sat between the two empresses to view the procession, which the placement of the plaques may reflect.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, 189&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[armill]] is a medieval variation, more often part of coronation regalia, which may also be relevant. 

The triumph of Stephanos Pergamos was approved by the Emperor at the last moment&lt;ref&gt;[[Zonaras]], 17.22.19&lt;/ref&gt; and Dawson argued that rushed production could explain the coarse finish and spelling errors; if it was given to Pergamos, the lower quality and relative plainness of the piece are explicable. The same would apply to the depiction of the emperor, odd on a piece he would wear himself, as is the depiction of a figure representing Humility.&lt;ref name="Dawson, 190"&gt;Dawson, 190&lt;/ref&gt; If it belonged to the emperor, or came to do so when Pergamos' possessions were later confiscated, then after the celebrations it would have been stored in the Imperial treasure chamber and then later sent to Hungary as a diplomatic gift.  Alternatively it may have escaped Byzantium in the wake of the downfall of Pergamos. Another possibility is that it is simply loot from the Crusaders' [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople in 1204]], or the [[Latin Empire|period of Latin rule]] thereafter. All these are speculative accounts.&lt;ref name="Dawson, 190"/&gt;

'''Mother Svea''' or '''''Mother Swea''''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Moder Svea'') is the female [[National personification|personification]] of [[Sweden]] and a [[national emblem|patriotic emblem]] of the Swedish nation.

==Background==
Mother Svea is normally depicted as a powerful [[Women warriors in literature and culture|female warrior]], [[valkyrie]] or [[shieldmaiden]], frequently holding a shield and standing beside a lion. Svea is a Swedish female [[personal name]] which derives from ''svea'', an old plural genitive form meaning "of the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]]" or the ''Swea''. It appears in ''Svea rike'', a translation of the old Swedish word ''Sverige'', the Swedish name for Sweden. 

The popular image is considered to have been created by Swedish writer, {{Interlanguage link multi|Anders Leijonstedt|sv}} (1649–1725) when first introduced in his poem ''Svea Lycksaligheets Triumph'' (1672).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofberg |first1=Herman |last2=Heurlin |first2=Frithiof |last3=Millqvist |first3=Viktor |last4=Rubenson |first4=Olof |title=Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon: alfabetiskt ordnade lefnadsteckningar af Sveriges namnkunniga män och kvinnor från reformationen till nuvarande tid |url=http://runeberg.org/sbh/b0035.html |edition=Ny uppl. /grundligt genomsedd, omarbetad och till våra dagar framförd af Frithiof Heurlin ... |year=1906 |publisher=Bonnier |location=Stockholm |language=sv |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a patriotic symbol,  Moder Svea  gained widespread popularity in ''Kunga Skald'' (1697), written by Swedish poet [[:sv:Gunno Dahlstierna|Gunno Eurelius]] (1661–1709) in honor of King [[Charles XI of Sweden]]. Eurelius was later ennobled with the name of Dahlstjerna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Meijer |editor-first1=Bernhard |editor-last2=Westrin |editor-first2=Theodor |title=Nordisk familjebok: konversationslexikon och realencyklopedi.

Mother Svea appeared frequently as a national symbol in 19th-century Swedish literature and culture. She appeared on various [[Swedish krona|Swedish banknote]]s for over seventy years, such as both the 5-kronor banknote printed between 1890–1952 and the 5-kronor banknote printed between 1954-1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riksbank.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=15373 |title=5-kronor banknote |publisher=Riksbank |date= |accessdate=2013-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927171612/http://www.riksbank.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=15373 |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish singer [[Lena Philipsson]] and  composer [[Torgny Söderberg]] wrote a song entitled ''Moder Swea'' which was introduced in the 1995 album ''[[Lena Philipsson (album)|Lena Philipsson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jango.com/music/Lena+Philipsson/_full_bio?l=0 |title=Lena Philipsson - Bio (All Media Guide, LLC.) |publisher=Jango.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museum Ethnographers Group''' ('''MEG''') is a [[United Kingdom]]-based collective for those working with and researching [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] collections in [[museum]]s. It is registered as a [[Charitable organization|charity]] in [[England]] and [[Wales]] (no. 1023150) and is recognised in the UK museum sector as a subject specialist network. It is often known to its members by its [[acronym]] MEG. Its most obvious functions are the annual [[Academic conference|conference]] it organises and the journal it publishes.

== History ==
MEG was founded in 1975 at a meeting in [[Liverpool]] on ''Communicating Anthropology — the role of museums'', when its first Chair was Peter Gathercole.&lt;ref&gt;Museum Ethnographers Newsletter No. 1 (19 July 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/ancestors/gathercole.html Interview of Peter Gathercole by Alan Macfarlane and Ami Henare]. Filmed by Alan Macfarlane at King's College, 8 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== MEG conference ==
MEG holds an annual conference, normally hosted by a UK museum. Recent conferences have been at the [[Museum of English Rural Life]], [[University of Reading]] (2010), [[Bristol Museum]]/[[University of Bristol|University]] (2009), [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], [[University of Oxford]] (2008), [[National Maritime Museum]], [[Greenwich]] (2007), [[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery]] (2006), [[Manchester Museum]] (2005), [[Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge]] (2004), [[University of Leicester]] (2003).

== Journal of Museum Ethnography ==
The MEG [[newsletter]] for many years functioned as a kind of journal, containing scholarly articles despite its photocopied pages.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} In 1989, MEG began to publish the ''[[Journal of Museum Ethnography]]'' (JME), and has done so every year since. In 2010, MEG reached an agreement with [[JSTOR]] to digitise all past issues of JME, as well as the early newsletters.

[[File:Karwar Pictures - Yogesa 19.JPG|thumb|Modern depiction of Vyasa narrating the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' to [[Ganesha]] at the [[Murudeshwara]] temple, Karnataka.]]
A '''national epic''' is an [[epic poetry|epic poem]] or a literary work of epic scope which seeks or is believed to capture and express the essence or spirit of a particular [[nation]]; not necessarily a [[nation state]], but at least an ethnic or linguistic group with aspirations to [[independence]] or [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]].  National epics frequently recount the origin of a nation, a part of its history, or a crucial event in the development of national identity such as other [[national symbol]]s.  In a broader sense, a national epic may simply be an epic in the national language which the people or government of that nation are particularly proud of. It is distinct from a [[pan-national epic]] which is taken as representative of a larger cultural or linguistic group than a nation or a nation-state.

==History==
[[File:Beowulf Cotton MS Vitellius A XV f. 132r.jpg|thumb|150px|left|First page of ''[[Beowulf]]'' in Cotton Vitellius A. xv]]
[[File:Jan Holly Vilimek.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Ján Hollý]] - author of the Slovak national epic poem ''Svatopluk''.]]
[[File:Dante Alighieri01.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Dante Alighieri]] - author of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.]]

In medieval times Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' was taken to be based on historical facts, and the [[Trojan War]] came to be considered as seminal in the genealogies of European monarchies.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cohen, "In search of the Trojan Origins of French", in ''Fantasies of Troy, Classical Tales and the Social Imaginary in Medieval and Early Modern Europe'', Alan Shepard, Stephen David Powell eds.,  published by the Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies, 2004, p. 65 sq., {{ISBN|0-7727-2025-8}}. "Like many of their counterparts across Europe, seventh-century scholars in France had invented a myth of the Trojan origins of Gaul" (p. 67)&lt;/ref&gt; Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' was taken to be the Roman equivalent of the ''Iliad'', starting from the Fall of Troy and leading up to the birth of the young Roman nation. According to the then prevailing conception of history{{vague|date=May 2013}}, empires were born and died in organic succession and correspondences existed between the past and the present. [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s 12th century classically inspired ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', for example, fulfilled this function for the [[Britons|British]] or [[Welsh People|Welsh]]. Just as kings longed to emulate great leaders of the past, Alexander or Caesar, it was a temptation for poets to become a new Homer or Virgil. In 16th century Portugal, [[Luis de Camões]] celebrated Portugal as a naval power in his ''[[Os Lusíadas]]''  while [[Pierre de Ronsard]] set out to write ''La Franciade'', an epic meant to be the Gallic equivalent of Virgil's poem that also traced back France's ancestry to Trojan princes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ditl.info/arttest/art352.php Epic]{{fr}} Liliane Kesteloot, University of Dakar&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of a national ''ethos'', however, preceded the coining of the phrase ''national epic'', which seems to originate with [[Romantic nationalism]].  Where no obvious national epic existed, the "Romantic spirit" was motivated to fill it. An early example of poetry that was invented to fill a perceived gap in "national" myth is [[Ossian]], the narrator and supposed author of a cycle of poems by [[James Macpherson]], which Macpherson claimed to have translated from ancient sources in [[Scottish Gaelic]].  However, many national epics (including Macpherson's ''Ossian'') antedate 19th-century romanticism.

In the early 20th century, the phrase no longer necessarily applies to an epic poem, and occurs to describe a literary work that readers and critics agree is emblematical of the literature of a nation, without necessarily including details from that nation's historical background. In this context the phrase has definitely positive connotations, as for example in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' where it is suggested ''[[Don Quixote]]'' is Spain's national epic while Ireland's remains as yet unwritten: &lt;blockquote&gt;They remind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says. Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;James Joyce. ''Ulysses'', Vintage Books, New York, 1961, 189 (p.192)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Noken Indonesia.jpg|thumb|A ''noken'' bag]]
'''''Noken''''' is a multifunctional knotted or woven [[bag]], native to the [[Papuan people|Papua]]. Its distinctive usage, which involves being hung from the head, is traditionally used to carry various goods, and also children. In 2012, ''noken'' was listed in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]] as a cultural heritage of [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title="Noken multifunctional knotted or woven bag, handcraft of the people of Papua", Inscribed in 2012 (7.COM) on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;USL=00619 |publisher= UNESCO |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women carrying noken are still a common sight in [[Wamena]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/26/transforming-wamena-papua%E2%80%99s-tourism-icon.html Transforming Wamena into Papua’s tourism icon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510062132/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/26/transforming-wamena-papua%E2%80%99s-tourism-icon.html |date=2013-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several areas of Papua, ''noken'' – instead of the usual ballot box – is preferred as a way to place ballots, where it is recognized as a ballot tool in the Papua regional leadership elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/02/05/papuans-remote-areas-prefer-noken039-ballot-box.html Papuans in remote areas prefer `noken' to ballot box]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/01/22/s-sulawesi-set-vote-papua-rules-noken.html Papua rules on ‘noken’]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43785">The '''Republic of Letters''' (''Respublica literaria'') is the long-distance  intellectual community in the late 17th and 18th centuries in Europe and the Americas. It fostered communication among the intellectuals of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], or ''[[philosophes]]'' as they were called in France.  The Republic of Letters emerged in the 17th century as a self-proclaimed community of scholars and literary figures that stretched across national boundaries but respected differences in language and culture.{{Sfn | Dalton | 2003 | p = 7}}  These communities that transcended national boundaries formed the basis of a metaphysical Republic.  Because of societal constraints on women, the Republic of Letters consisted mostly of men. As such, many scholars use "Republic of Letters" and "[[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]]" interchangeably.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The circulation of handwritten letters was necessary for its function because it enabled intellectuals to correspond with each other from great distances. All citizens of the 17th-century Republic of Letters corresponded by letter, exchanged published papers and pamphlets, and considered it their duty to bring others into the Republic through the expansion of correspondence.{{Sfn | Goodman | 1994 | p = 17}}

The first known occurrence of the term in its Latin form (''Respublica literaria'') is in a letter by [[Francesco Barbaro (politician)|Francesco Barbaro]] to [[Poggio Bracciolini]] dated July 6, 1417;&lt;ref&gt;Hans Bots, Françoise Waquet, ''La Rèpublique des Lettres'', Paris: Belin - De Boeck, 1997, pp. 11-13 (on the first uses of the term).&lt;/ref&gt; it was used increasingly in the 16th and 17th, so that by the end of that century it featured in the titles of several important journals.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | p = 2}}  Currently, the consensus is that [[Pierre Bayle]] first translated the term in his journal ''[[Nouvelles de la République des Lettres]]'' in 1684.  But there are some historians who disagree and some have gone so far as to say that its origin dates back to Plato's ''Republic''.{{Sfn | Lambe | 1988 | p = 273}}  Part of the difficulty in determining its origin is that, unlike an academy or literary society, it existed only in the minds of its members.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | p = 2}}

Historians are presently debating the importance of the Republic of Letters in influencing the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10835.html|title=Mokyr, J.: A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy. (eBook and Hardcover)|website=press.princeton.edu|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most Anglo-American historians, whatever their point of entry to debate, occupy a common ground: the Republic of Letters and the Enlightenment were distinct.{{Sfn | Brockliss | 2002 | p = 8}}

==Academies==
{{Main article |Academy}}
[[File:Institut de France - Académie française et pont des Arts.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Institut de France building]]
The mid-17th century had seen the community of the curious take its first tentative steps towards institutionalization with the establishment of permanent literary and scientific academies in Paris and London under royal patronage. The foundation of the [[Royal Society]] in 1662, with its open door, was particularly important in legitimizing the Republic of Letters in England and providing a European center of gravity for the movement. The Royal Society primarily promoted science, which was undertaken by gentlemen of means acting independently. The Royal Society created its charters and established a system of governance. Its most famous leader was [[Isaac Newton]], president from 1703 until his death in 1727. Other notable members include diarist [[John Evelyn]], writer [[Thomas Sprat]], and scientist [[Robert Hooke]], the Society's first curator of experiments.  It played an international role to adjudicate scientific findings, and published the journal "Philosophical Transactions" edited by [[Henry Oldenburg]].{{Sfn | Michael | 2010 | pp = 34–40}}{{Sfn | Brockliss | 2002 | p = 10}}

The seventeenth century saw new academies open in France,&lt;ref&gt;Alice Stroup, ''A company of scientists: Botany, patronage, and community at the seventeenth-century Parisian Royal Academy of Sciences'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = R.J.W. | year = 1977 | title = Learned societies in Germany in the seventeenth century | url = | journal = European History Quarterly | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 129–151 | doi=10.1177/026569147700700201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and elsewhere.  By 1700 they were found in most major cultural centers. They helped local members contact like-minded intellectuals elsewhere in the Republic of Letters and thus become cosmopolitans.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob, ''Strangers nowhere in the world: the rise of cosmopolitanism in early modern Europe'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  In Paris specialization was taken to new heights where, in addition to existing [[Académie Française]] and the [[Académie des Sciences]] founded in 1635 and 1666, there were three further royal foundations in the 18th century: the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] (1701), the Académie de Chirurgie (1730), and the Société de Médecine (1776).{{Sfn | Brockliss | 2002 | p = 10}}

By the second half of the 18th century universities abandoned [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] natural philosophy and Galenist medicine in favor of the mechanist and [[vitalist]] ideas of the moderns, so they placed a greater emphasis on learning by seeing. Everywhere in teaching science and medicine the monotonous diet of dictated lectures was supplemented and sometimes totally replaced by practical courses in experimental physics, astronomy, chemistry, anatomy, botany, ''[[materia medica]]'', even geology and [[natural history]].{{Sfn | Brockliss | 2002 | p = 11}}  The new emphasis on practical learning meant that the university now offered a much more welcoming environment to the Republic of Letters. Although most professors and teachers were still uninterested in membership, the ideological and pedagogical changes across the century created the conditions in which the pursuit of curiosity in the university world became much more possible and even attractive.{{Sfn | Brockliss | 2002 | p = 11}}

Institutions – academies, journals, literary societies – took over some of the roles, duties, and activities of scholarship.  Communication, for example, did not have to be from individual to individual; it could take place between academies, and pass thence to scholars, or be encapsulated in literary journals, to be diffused among the whole scholarly community. Literary agents, working for libraries but sharing the values of the learned community, demonstrate this professionalization on the most fundamental level.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | p = 11}}

==Salons==
The salonnière played a prominent role in establishing order within the Republic of Letters during the Enlightenment period. Beginning in the 17th century, salons served to bring together nobles and intellectuals in an atmosphere of civility and fair play in order to educate one, refine the other, and create a common medium of cultural exchange based on the shared notion of ''[[honnêteté]]'' that combined learning, good manners, and conversational skill.{{Sfn | Kale | 2004 | p = 24}}  But government was needed because, while the Republic of Letters was structured in theory by egalitarian principles of reciprocity and exchange, the reality of intellectual practice fell far short of this ideal. French men of letters in particular found themselves increasingly engaged in divisive quarrels rather than in constructive debate.{{Sfn | Goodman | 1991 | p = 183}}  With the establishment of Paris as the capital of the Republic, French men of letters had enriched traditional epistolary relations with direct verbal ones. That is, finding themselves drawn together by the capital, they began to meet together and make their collaboration on the project of Enlightenment direct, and thus suffered the consequences of giving up the mediation that the written word provided. Without this traditional kind of formal mediation, the ''philosophes'' needed a new kind of governance.{{Sfn | Goodman | 1991 | p = 184}}

The Parisian salon gave the Republic of Letters source of political order in the person of the salonnière, for she gave order both to social relations among salon guests and to the discourse in which they engaged. When [[Marie Thérèse Rodet Geoffrin|Marie-Thérèse Geoffrin]] launched her weekly dinners in 1749, the Enlightenment Republic of Letters found its ‘center of unity’. As a regular and regulated formal gathering hosted by a woman in her own home, the Parisian salon could serve as an independent forum and locus of intellectual activity for a well-governed Republic of Letters. From 1765 until 1776, men of letters and those who wanted to be counted among the citizens of their Republic could meet in Parisian salons any day of the week.{{Sfn | Goodman | 1991 | p = 184}}

[[File:Presumed Portrait of Madame Geoffrin.jpg|thumb|Presumed portrait of [[Madame Geoffrin|Mme Geoffrin]], by [[Marianne Loir]] ([[National Museum of Women in the Arts]], Washington, D.C.)]]
The salons were literary institutions that relied on a new ethic of polite sociability based on hospitality, distinction, and the entertainment of the elite. The salons were open to intellectuals, who used them to find protectors and sponsors and to fashion themselves as 'hommes du monde.' In the salons after 1770 there emerged a radical critique of worldliness, inspired by Rousseau. These radicals denounced the mechanisms of polite sociability and called for a new model of the independent writer, who would address the public and the nation.{{Sfn | Lilti | 2005 | pp = 415–45}}

Lilti (2005) argues that the salon never provided an egalitarian space. Rather, salons only provided a form of sociability where politeness and congeniality of aristocrats maintained a fiction of equality that never dissolved differences in status but nonetheless made them bearable.  The ''"grands"'' (high-ranking nobles) only played the game of mutual esteem as long as they kept the upper hand. Men of letters were well aware of this rule, never confusing the politeness of the salons with equality in conversation.{{Sfn | Lilti | 2005b | p = 5}}

As well, the advantages that writers gained from visiting salons extended to the protection by their hosts.  The salons provided crucial support in the career of an author, not because they were literary institutions, but, on the contrary, because they allowed men of letters to emerge from the circles of the Republic of Letters and access the resources of aristocratic and royal patronage.{{Sfn | Lilti | 2005b | p = 7}}  As a result, instead of an opposition between the court and the Republic of Letters they are instead a collection of spaces and resources focused around the court as a center of power and distribution of favors.{{Sfn | Lilti | 2005b | p = 8}}

Antoine Lilti paints a picture of a reciprocal relationship between men of letters and salonnières. Salonnières attracted the finest men of letters through gift-giving or regular allowance in order to boost the reputation of the salons.{{Sfn | Lilti | 2005b | pp = 5–6}}  For salon hosts and hostesses, they were not merely sources of information, but also important points of relay in the circulation of praise. From one salon to the next, in conversation as in correspondence, men of letters gladly praised the social groups who welcomed them.{{Sfn | Lilti | 2005b | p = 11}}  In turn, the salon hostess had to be able to prove their capacity to mobilize as many high society contacts as possible in favor of their protégés. Consequently, correspondences openly display network of influence, and the woman of high society employed all their know-how to help benefit those men of letters whose elections to the academies they supported.{{Sfn | Lilti | 2005b | p = 9}}

===American salons===
Mixed intellectual company was also found in 18th-century [[Philadelphia]] for those who sought it, sometimes in social gatherings modeled upon the salons of London and Paris. Where mixed social intercourse of a literary nature was concerned, Americans were virtuously and patriotically inclined to be wary of European examples. Conscious of the relative purity as well as the provinciality of their society, Americans did not seek to replicate what they perceived as the decadent societies of London and Paris. Nevertheless, to facilitate social intercourse of a literary nature where women were involved, Americans, led by certain strong-minded women, did draw upon and domesticate two models of such mixed intellectual company, one French and the other English.{{Sfn | Ostrander | 1999 | p = 65}}

In America intellectually motivated women consciously emulated these two European models of sociability: the ever fashionable French model of mistress of the salon, drawing upon feminine social [[adroitness (personality trait)|adroitness]] in arranging meetings of minds, chiefly male, and the ever unfashionable English bluestocking model of no-nonsense, cultivated discourse, chiefly among women. Outside literary salons and clubs, society at large was mixed by nature, as were the families that constituted it. And whether or not men of letters chose to include ''femme [[Expert|savants]]'' in the Literary Republic, literary women shared such sociability as society at large afforded. This varied widely in America from one locality to one another.{{Sfn | Ostrander | 1999 | p = 66}}

==Printing press==
{{Main article |Printing press}}
Very soon after the introduction of printing with moveable type, the Republic of Letters became closely identified with the press.{{Sfn | Lambe | 1988 | p = 273}}  The printing press also played a prominent role in the establishment of a community of scientists who could easily communicate their discoveries through the establishment of widely disseminated journals. Because of the printing press, authorship became more meaningful and profitable. The main reason was that it provided correspondence between the author and the person who owned the printing presses – the publisher. This correspondence allowed the author to have a greater control of its production and distribution. The channels opened up by the great publishing houses provided a gradual movement towards an international ''Respublica'' with set channels of communication and particular points of focus (e.g. university towns and publishing houses), or simply the home of a respected figure.{{Sfn | Lambe | 1988 | p = 274}}

===Journals===
[[File:1665 journal des scavans title.jpg|thumb|right|The first issue of the ''Journal des Sçavans'' (title page)]]
Many learned periodicals began as imitations or rivals of publications originating after the mid-17th century. It is generally acknowledged that the ''[[Journal des Sçavans]]'', a French journal started in 1665, is the father of all journals.{{Sfn | Fiering | 1976 | p = 644}}  The first of the Dutch-based ones, and also the first of the genuinely "critical" journals, the ''[[Nouvelles de la République des Lettres]]'', edited by [[Pierre Bayle]], appeared in March 1684, followed in 1686 by the ''[[Bibliothèque Universelle]]'' of [[Jean Leclerc (theologian)|Jean Le Clerc]]. While French and Latin predominated, there was also soon a demand for book news and reviews in German and Dutch.{{Sfn | Israel | 2001 | p = 143}}

[[File:Pierre Bayle.jpg|left|frame|Pierre Bayle]]
Journals did represent a new and different way of conducting business in the Republic of Letters. Like the printed book before them, journals intensified and multiplied the circulation of information; and since they consisted largely of book reviews (known as ''[[extraits]]''), they enormously increased scholars’ potential knowledge about what was going on in their own community.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | p = 56}}  In the beginning, the audience and authorship of literary journals was largely the Republic of Letters itself.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | p = 59}}

The evolution of a true periodical press was slow, but once this principle was established it was only a matter of time before printers would perceive that the public was also interested in the world of scholarship.{{Sfn | Lambe | 1988 | p = 277}}  As readership increased, it was clear that the tone, language, and content of journals implied that journalists defined their audience under a new form of Republic of Letters: either those who took an active role by writing and instructing others, or those who contented themselves with reading books and following the debates in the journals.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | pp = 64–65}}  Formerly the domain of "les [[Expert|savants]]" and "[[érudits]]," the Republic of Letters now became the province of "les [[curieux]]."{{Sfn | Lambe | 1988 | p = 277}}

The ideals of the Republic of Letters as a community thus come out in journals, both in their own statements of purpose in prefaces and introductions, and in their actual contents. Just as one goal of a ''commerce de lettres'' was to inform two people, the goal of the journal was to inform many.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | p = 65}}  In acting out this public role in the Republic of Letters, journals became a personification of the group as a whole. Attitudes of both journalists and readers suggest that a literary journal was regarded as in some sense an ideal member of the Republic of Letters.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | p = 98}}

It is also important to note that there has been some disagreements with [[Goldgar]]'s sense of the importance of journals in the Republic of Letters.  [[Françoise Waquet]] has argued that literary journals did not in fact replace the ''commerce de lettres''. Journals depended on letters for their own information. Moreover, the periodical press often failed to satisfy the scholarly desire for news. Its publication and sale were often too slow to satisfy readers, and its discussions of books and news could seem incomplete for such reasons, as specialization, religious bias, or simple distortion. Letters clearly remained desirable and useful. Yet it is certain that, from the time journals became a central feature of the Republic of Letters, many readers gained their news primarily from that source.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | p = 57}}

==Transatlantic Republic of Letters==
[[File:STEELE Richard.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The author of the ''Spectator'', Richard Steele]]
Historians have long understood that the English and French periodicals had a strong influence on colonial American letters.{{Sfn | Fiering | 1976 | p = 642}}  During this period, the variety of institutions used for transmitting ideas did not exist in America. Aside from the largely arbitrarily assembled booksellers' stocks, an occasional overseas correspondence, and the publisher's or printer's advertisements to be found in the back of the books, the only way colonial intellectuals could keep alive their philosophical interests was through the reporting in [[periodical literature]].{{Sfn | Fiering | 1976 | p = 643}}

Examples include [[Benjamin Franklin]], who cultivated his perspicuous style in imitation of the ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]''. [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]'s manuscript ''Catalogue of reading'' reveals that he not only knew the ''Spectator'' before 1720 but was so enamored of [[Richard Steele]] that he tried to get his hands on everything: the ''Guardian'', the ''Englishman'', the ''Reader'', and more. At Harvard College in 1721 a weekly periodical entitled the ''[[Telltale (magazine)|Telltale]]'' was inaugurated by a group of students, including [[Ebenezer Pemberton]], [[Charles Chauncy]], and [[Isaac Greenwood]]. As the ''Telltale's'' subtitle – "Criticisms on the Conversation and Behaviours of Scholars to promote right reasoning and good manners" – made explicit, it was a direct imitation of the English genteel periodical.{{Sfn | Fiering | 1976 | p = 642}}

[[File:Acta2.jpg|thumb|right|Title Page of an issue for ''Acta Eruditorum'']]
One of the best examples of a transatlantic Republic of Letters began about 1690, when [[John Dunton]] launched a series of journalistic ventures, nearly all of them under the aegis of a forward-looking "club" called the [[Athenian Society]], an English predecessor of Harvard's Telltale Club, Franklin's [[Junto (club)|Junto]], and other such associations dedicated to mental and moral improvement. The Athenian society took it as one of their particular goals to spread learning in the vernacular.  One of the plans of this group in 1691 was the publication of translations from the ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]'', the ''[[Journal des Sçavans]]'', the ''[[Bibliothèque Universelle]]'', and the ''[[Giornale de Letterati]]''.{{Sfn | Fiering | 1976 | p = 649}}  The outcome was the formation of ''The Young Students Library, containing Extracts and Abridgements of the Most Valuable Books Printed in England and in the Foreign Journals from the year Sixty-Five to the Present Time''.{{Sfn | Fiering | 1976 | p = 650}}  The ''Young Students Library'', like the ''Universal Historical Bibliothèque'' of 1687, was made up almost entirely of translated pieces, in this case mostly from the ''Journal des Sçavans'', Bayle's ''Nouvelles de la République des Lettres, and Le Clerc's and La Crose's ''Bibliothèque Universelle et Historique''.{{Sfn | Fiering | 1976 | p = 650}}

The ''Young Students Library'' of 1692 was exemplary of the kind of material to be found in later forms of the learned periodical in England. Expressly lamenting the absence in England of periodicals, the ''Young Students Library'' was designed to fill the need in America for periodical literature.{{Sfn | Fiering | 1976 | p = 651}}

For Americans it served, according to David D Hall, as:
{{quote | An expansive vision of learnedness, articulated especially during the Revolutionary period, as a means of advancing 'liberty' and thereby fulfilling the promise of a republican America. It drew together political radicals and religious dissenters on both sides of the Atlantic, who drew from their shared struggles against a corrupted Parliament and the Church of England a common agenda of constitutional reform.{{Sfn | Konig | 2004 | p = 180}}}}

==Historiographical debates==
Anglo-American historians have turned their attention to the Enlightenment's dissemination and promotion, inquiring into the mechanisms by which it played a role in the collapse of the [[Ancien Régime]].{{Sfn | Brockliss | 2002 | p = 6}}  This attention to the mechanisms of dissemination and promotion has led historians to debate the importance of the Republic of Letters during the Enlightenment.

===Enlightenment as a rhetoric===
In 1994, [[Dena Goodman]] published ''[[The Republic of Letters: A Cultural History of the French Enlightenment]]''. In this feminist work, she described the Enlightenment not as a set of ideas but as a rhetoric. For her, it was essentially an open-minded discourse of discovery where like-minded intellectuals adopted a traditionally feminine mode of discussion to explore the great problems of life.  Enlightenment discourse was purposeful gossip and indissolubly connected with the Parisian salons.{{Sfn | Brockliss | 2002 | p = 7}}  Goodman questions as well the degree to which the public sphere is necessarily masculine. Under the influence of [[Habermas]]'s ''[[Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'', she proposes an alternative division that defines women as belonging to an authentic public sphere of government critique through [[Salon (gathering)|salons]], [[Masonic lodges]], [[academies]], and the [[News media|press]].{{Sfn | Dalton | 2003 | p = 4}}

Like the French monarchy, the Republic of Letters is a modern phenomenon with an ancient history. References to the ''Respublica literaria'' have been found as early as 1417. Nevertheless, the concept of the Republic of Letters emerged only in the early 17th century, and became widespread only at the end of that century.{{Sfn | Goodman | 1994 | p = 14}}  Paul Dibon, cited by Goodman, defines the Republic of Letters as it was conceived in the 17th-century as:
{{quote|An intellectual community transcending space and time, [but] recognizing as such differences in respect to the diversity of languages, sects, and countries&amp;nbsp;...  This state, ideal as it may be, is in no way utopian, but... takes form in [good] old human flesh where good and evil mix.{{Sfn | Goodman | 1994 | p = 15}}}}

According to Goodman, by the 18th century, the Republic of Letters was composed of French men and women, philosophes and salonnières, who worked together to attain the ends of philosophy, broadly conceived as the project of Enlightenment.{{Sfn | Goodman | 1994 | p = 9}}  In her opinion, the central discursive practices of the Enlightenment Republic of Letters were polite conversation and letter writing, and its defining social institution was the Parisian salon.{{Sfn | Goodman | 1994 | p = 3}}

Goodman argues that, by the middle of the 18th-century, French men of letters used discourses of sociability to argue that France was the most civilized nation in the world because it was the most sociable and most polite.  French men of letters saw themselves as the leaders of a project of Enlightenment that was both cultural and moral, if not political. By representing French culture as the leading edge of civilization, they identified the cause of humanity with their own national causes and saw themselves as at the same time French patriots and upstanding citizens of a cosmopolitan Republic of Letters. [[Voltaire]], both a zealous champion of French culture and the leading citizen of the Enlightenment Republic of Letters, contributed more than anyone else to this self-representation of national identity.{{Sfn | Goodman | 1994 | p = 4}}

Over the course of the 17th and 18th centuries the growth of the Republic of Letters paralleled that of the French monarchy. This history of the Republic of Letters is interwoven with that of the monarchy from its consolidation after the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] until its downfall in the [[French Revolution]]. Dena Goodman finds this to be very important because this provides a history of the Republic of Letters, from its founding in the 17th century as an apolitical community of discourse through its transformation in the 18th century into a very political community whose project of Enlightenment challenged the monarchy from a new public space carved out of French society.{{Sfn | Goodman | 1994 | p = 12}}

===Engendering the Republic of Letters===
In 2003, [[Susan Dalton]] published ''[[Engendering the Republic of Letters: Reconnecting Public and Private Spheres]]''. Dalton supports Dena Goodman's view that women played a role in the Enlightenment. On the other hand, Dalton does not agree with Goodman for using Habermas's idea of the public and private spheres. While the public sphere has the capacity to include women, it is not the best tool for mapping the full range of political and intellectual action open to them because it provides an overly restrictive definition of what is properly political and/or historically relevant. In fact, this is the wider problem with relying on any public/private division: it shapes and even limits the vision of women's political and intellectual action by defining it in relation to specific venues and institutions because these are identified as the arenas of power and, ultimately, historical agency.{{Sfn | Dalton | 2003 | p = 4}}

To study in a wider form of Republic of Letters, Dalton analyzed the correspondence of salon women to display the link between intellectual institutions and the various types of sociability. In particular, she examined the correspondence of two French and two Venetian salon women at the end of the 18th century in order to understand their role in the Republic of Letters. These women were [[Julie de Lespinasse]] (1732–76), [[Marie-Jeanne Roland]] (1754–93), [[Giustina Renier Michiel]] (1755–1832) and [[Elisabetta Mosconi Contarini]] (1751–1807).{{Sfn | Dalton | 2003 | p = 5}}

To engage in literary commerce, to send news, books, literature – even compliments and criticism – was to show one's commitment to the community as a whole. Given the importance of these exchanges for ensuring the perpetuation of the republic of letters as a community, Lespinasse, Roland, Mosconi, and Renier Michiel worked to reinforce cohesion through friendship and loyalty.  Thus sending a letter or procuring a book was a sign of personal devotion that engendered a social debt to be fulfilled.  In turn, one's ability to fulfill these charges marked one as a good friend and therefore a virtuous member of the Republic of Letters. The fact that both qualities had to overlap explains the practice of recommending one's friends and acquaintances for literary prizes and governmental posts. If women were able to make recommendations that carried weight for both political posts and literary prizes, it was because they were thought capable of evaluating and expressing the values integral to relation in the Republic of Letters. They could judge and produce not only grace and beauty but also friendship and virtue.{{Sfn | Dalton | 2003 | p = 7}}

By tracing the nature and extent of their participation in intellectual and political debates, it was possible to show the degree to which women's actions diverged not only from conservative gender models but also from their own formulations concerning women's proper social role. Although they often insisted on their own sensibility and lack of critical capacities, the salon women Susan Dalton studied also defined themselves as belonging to the Republic of Letters not only with reference to the very different conception of gender offered by the ''[[gens de lettres]]'' but also with reference to a wider, gender-neutral vocabulary of personal qualities revered by them even when it contradicted their discourse on gender.{{Sfn | Dalton | 2003 | p = 8}}

===Conduct and community===
In 1995, [[Anne Goldgar]] published ''[[Impolite Learning: Conduct and Community in the Republic of Letters, 1680–1750]]''. Goldgar sees the Republic as a cluster of learned scholars and scientists, whose correspondence and published works (usually in Latin) reveal a community of conservative scholars with preference for substance over style. Lacking any common institutional attachments and finding it difficult to attract aristocratic and courtly patrons, the community created the Republic of Letters to boost morale as much as for any intellectual reason.{{Sfn | Brockliss | 2002 | p = 6}}  Goldgar argues that, in the transitional period between the 17th century and the Enlightenment, the most important common concern by members of the Republic was their own conduct. In the conception of its own members, ideology, religion, political philosophy, scientific strategy, or any other intellectual or philosophical framework were not as important as their own identity as a community{{Sfn | Brockliss | 2002 | p = 7}}

The [[philosophes]], by contrast, represented a new generation of men of letters who were consciously controversial and politically subversive. Moreover, they were urbane popularizers, whose style and lifestyle was much more in tune with the sensibilities of the aristocratic elite who set the tone for the reading public.{{Sfn | Brockliss | 2002 | p = 7}}

Certain broad features can, however, be painted into the picture of the Republic of Letters. The existence of communal standards highlights the first of these: that the scholarly world considered itself to be in some ways separate from the rest of society. Contemporary scholars of the 17th and 18th-centuries felt that, at least in the academic realm, they were not subject to the norms and values of the wider society. Unlike their non-scholarly counterparts, they thought they lived in an essentially egalitarian community, in which all members had equal rights to criticize the work and conduct of others. Moreover, the Republic of Letters in theory ignored distinctions of nationality and religion.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | p = 3}}

The conventions of the Republic of Letters were a great convenience to scholars throughout Europe.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | p = 19}}  Scholars in correspondence with each other felt free to ask for assistance in research whenever it was necessary; indeed one of the functions of the ''[[commerce de lettres]]'', the purely literary correspondence, was to promote opportunities for research.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | p = 15}}  Even cities which could in no sense be called isolated, such as Paris or Amsterdam, always lacked certain amenities of [[scholarship]]. Many books published in the Netherlands, for example, only found their way to Dutch presses because they were prohibited in France. [[Manuscripts]] necessary for research were often in libraries inaccessible to people in other towns. Literary journals usually could not provide enough information with sufficient rapidity to satisfy the needs of most scholars.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | p = 19}}

The role of intermediary was also prominent in the Republic of Letters. Scholars wrote on behalf of others asking for hospitality, books, and help in research. Often the involvement of an intermediary was a matter of simple convenience.  However, the use of an intermediary frequently had underlying sociological meaning.  A request ending in failure can be both embarrassing and demeaning; refusal to perform a service could mean that the solicited part prefers not to enter into a reciprocal relationship with someone of lower status.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | p = 31}}

But an intermediary did not merely bear the brunt of refusal; he also contributed to a transaction's success. The ability to use an intermediary indicated that a scholar had at least one contact in the Republic of Letters. This gave proof of his membership in the group, and the intermediary would usually attest to his positive scholarly qualities. In addition, the intermediary usually had wider contacts and consequently higher status within the community.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | p = 31}}

Although status differences did exist in the Republic of Letters, such differences in fact strengthened rather than weakened the community. The ethos of service, combined with the advantage of gaining status by obliging others, meant that someone of higher ranking was moved to assist his subordinates.  In doing so, he reinforced ties between himself and other scholars. By arranging help for a scholar, he forged or hardened links with the person served, while at the same time reinforcing his reciprocal ties with the final provider of the service.{{Sfn | Goldgar | 1995 | p = 32}}

===Intellectual transparency and laicizations===
Goodman's approach has found favor with the medical historian [[Thomas Broman]]. Building on Habermas, Broman argues that the Enlightenment was a movement of intellectual transparency and laicization. While members of the Republic of Letters lived hermetically sealed from the outside world, talking only to one another, their enlightened successors deliberately placed their ideas before the bar of a nascent public opinion. Broman essentially sees The Republic of Letters as located in the cabinet and the Enlightenment in the market-place.{{Sfn | Brockliss | 2002 | p = 7}}

[[File:Paul Hazard.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Paul Hazard]]
For most Anglo-American historians, the classic Enlightenment is a forward-looking movement. To these historians, the Republic of Letters are an outdated construction of the 17th century. But in [[J. G. A. Pocock|John Pocock]]'s eyes there are two Enlightenments: one, associated with [[Edward Gibbon]], the author of the ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', which is erudite, serious, and scholarly grounded in the Republic of Letters; the other, the trivial Enlightenment of the Parisian ''philosophes''. The first is a product of a peculiarly English/British and Protestant liberal political and theological tradition and points to the future; the second lacks the anchor of socio-historical analysis and leads unintentionally to Revolutionary mayhem.{{Sfn | Brockliss | 2002 | p = 7}}

In the 1930s, the French historian [[Paul Hazard]] homed in on the age of [[Pierre Bayle]] and argued that the cumulative effect of the many different and mordant strands of intellectual curiosity in the last quarter of the 17th century created a European cultural crisis, whose negative harvest the ''philosophes'' were to reap.  The Republic of Letters and the Enlightenment were insolubly interconnected. Both were movements of criticism.{{Sfn | Brockliss | 2002 | p = 5}}

According to [[Peter Gay]], building on [[Ernst Cassirer]]'s much earlier study of the intellectual progenitors of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the Enlightenment was the creation of a small group of thinkers, his family of ''philosophes'' or ‘party of humanity’, whose coherent anti-Christian, ameliorist, and individualistic programme of reform developed from very specific cultural roots. The Enlightenment was not the offspring of the Republic of Letters, let alone the culmination of three centuries of anti-[[Augustinian]] critique, but rather the result of the singular marriage of [[Lucretius]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. When a handful of French freethinkers in the second quarter of the 18th century encountered the methodology and achievements of Newtonian science, experimental philosophy and unbelief were mixed together in an explosive cocktail, which gave its imbibers the means to develop a new science of man. Since Gay's work was published, his interpretation of the Enlightenment has become an orthodoxy in the Anglo-Saxon world.{{Sfn | Brockliss | 2002 | p = 5}}

In [[medicine]], '''rural health''' or '''rural medicine''' is the [[interdisciplinary]] study of [[health]] and [[health care]] delivery in [[rural]] environments. The concept of rural health incorporates many fields, including [[geography]], [[midwifery]], [[nursing]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], and [[telehealth]] or [[telemedicine]].

Research shows that the healthcare needs of individuals living in rural areas are different from those in urban areas, and rural areas often suffer from a lack of access to healthcare. These differences are the result of geographic, demographic, [[socioeconomic]], workplace, and personal health factors. For example, many rural communities have a large proportion of elderly people and children. With relatively few people of working age (20–50 years of age), such communities have a high [[dependency ratio]]. People living in rural areas also tend to have poorer socioeconomic conditions, less education, higher rates of tobacco and alcohol use, and higher [[mortality rates]] when compared to their urban counterparts.&lt;ref name=initiative&gt;{{cite book|title=How healthy are Rural Canadians? An Assessment of Their Health Status and Health Determinants|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/rural06/pdf/rural_canadians_2006_report_e.pdf|year=2006|publisher=Canadian Institute for Health Information|location=Ottawa|isbn=978-1-55392-881-2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308025204/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/rural06/pdf/rural_canadians_2006_report_e.pdf|archivedate=2010-03-08 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also high rates of poverty amongst rural dwellers in many parts of the world, and poverty is one of the biggest [[social determinants of health in poverty|social determinants of health]].

Many countries have made it a priority to increase funding for research on rural health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|isbn=07308 56844|agency=National Rural Health Alliance|year=2003|title=Healthy Horizons- Outlook 2003-2007: A Framework for Improving the Health of Rural, Regional, and Remote Australians|publisher=Australian Health Ministries’ Advisory Council’s National Rural Health Policy Sub-committee and the National Rural Health Alliance for the Australian Health Minister’s Conference|url=http://www.ruralhealth.org.au/sites/default/files/healthy-horizons/healthy%20horizons%20outlook%202003-2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.srpc.ca/PDF/rural_hands.pdf|author=Ministerial Advisory Council on Rural Health|year=2002|title=Rural Health in Rural Hands: Strategic Directions for Rural, Remote, Northern and Aboriginal Communities|location=Ottawa|publisher=Health Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts have led to the development of several research institutes with rural [[Health maintenance organization#Regulation|health mandates]], including  the [[Centre for Rural and Northern Health Research]] in [[Canada]], [[Countryside Agency]] in the [[United Kingdom]], the Institute of Rural Health in [[Australia]], and the [[New Zealand]] Institute of Rural Health. These research efforts are designed to help identify the healthcare needs of rural communities and provide policy solutions to ensure those needs are met. The concept of incorporating the needs of rural communities into government services is sometimes referred to as ''rural proofing''.

==Definitions==
There is no international standard for defining rural areas, and standards may vary even within an individual country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Population density and urbanization|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sconcerns/densurb/densurbmethods.htm#B|work=United Nations Statistics Division|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pong, R. W.|author2=Pitbaldo, R, J|year=2001|title=Don't take "geography" for granted! Some methodological issues in measuring geographic distribution of physicians|journal=Canadian Journal of Rural Medicine|volume=6|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly used methodologies fall into two main camps: population-based factors and geography-based factors. The methodologies used for identifying rural areas include [[population size]], [[population density]], distance from an urban centre, settlement patterns, [[labor market]] influences, and postal codes.&lt;ref name=Pitblado_2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pitblado|first=JR|title=So, what do we mean by "rural," "remote" and "northern"?|journal=The Canadian Journal of Nursing Research|date=March 2005 |volume=37|issue=1|pages=163–8|pmid=15887771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reported number of individuals living in rural areas can vary greatly depending on which set of standards is applied. Canada’s rural population can be identified as anywhere from 22% to 38%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=du Plessis, V.|author2=Beshiri, R.|author3=Bollman, R.|author4=Clemenson, H.|year=2001|title=Definitions of Rural|journal=Rural and Small Town Canada Analysis Bulletin|volume=3|number=3|url=http://www.communityaccounts.ca/communityaccounts/ca_google_maps/PDF_Links/Stats_Canada_Definition_of_Rural_2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the population. In the [[United States]] the variation is greater; between 17% and 63% of the population may be identified as living in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United-States Department of Agriculture|year=2007|title=Rural Definitions: Data Documentation and Methods|accessdate=January 31, 2008|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/Ruraldefinitions/documentation.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of consensus makes it difficult to identify the number of individuals who are in need of rural healthcare services.

==Life expectancy==
Studies show that in many parts of the world [[Life expectancy|life expectancy rates]] are higher in urban areas than in rural areas.&lt;ref name=initiative /&gt; There is some evidence to suggest that the gap may be widening in these countries as economic conditions and health education has improved in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stephens|first=Stephanie|title=Gap in Life Expectancy Between Rural and Urban Residents Is Growing|url=http://www.cfah.org/hbns/2014/gap-in-life-expectancy-between-rural-and-urban-residents-is-growing|work=Center for Advancing Health|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, life expectancy in men ranged from 74 years in the most remote areas to 76.8 years in its urban centers. For women, life expectancy was also lowest in rural areas, with an average of 81.3 years. Those living in rural areas adjacent to urban centers also experience higher life expectancies (with men at 77.4 years and women at 81.5 years). Australian life expectancies ranged from 78 years in major cities to 72 years in remote locations.&lt;ref name="welfare2005"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|year=2005|title=Rural, regional, and remote health: Indicators of health|accessdate=February 19, 2008|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/index.cfm/title/10123|isbn=9781740244671}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the life expectancy of females is 73.59 years in urban areas and 72.46 in rural areas. Male life expectancy varies from 69.73 years in urban areas and 58.99 in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shen|first=J|title=Analysis of urban-rural population dynamics of China: a multiregional life table approach|journal=Environment and Planning|date=February 1993|volume=25|issue=2|pages=245–53|pmid=12286564|doi=10.1068/a250245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are countries such as the United Kingdom, where life expectancy in rural areas exceeds that of urban areas. Life expectancy there is two years greater for men and one-and-a-half years greater for women in rural areas when compared to urban areas. This may be due, in part, to smaller economic disparities in rural areas as well as an increasing number of well-educated and wealthy individuals moving to rural areas in retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramesh|first=Randeep|title=Country dwellers live longer, report on 'rural idyll' shows|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/may/25/rural-idyll-boots-life-expectancy|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a significant departure to the [[rural poverty]] found in many countries.

==Health determinants==

===Access to healthcare===
[[File:Telemedicine Consult.jpg|thumb|Telemedicine consult: Dr. Juan Manuel Romero, a cardiologist in [[Sonora, Mexico]], engages in a pre-op consultation with Alma Guadalupe Xoletxilva, who is {{convert|640|km|abbr=on}} away in [[La Paz, Baja California]]. Telemedicine helps deliver care to patients in rural and remote areas.]]
People in rural areas generally have less access to healthcare than their urban counterparts. Fewer medical practitioners, mental health programs and healthcare facilities in these areas often mean less preventative care and longer response times in emergencies. The lack of healthcare workers has resulted in unconventional ways of delivering healthcare to rural dwellers, including medical consultations by phone or internet as well as mobile preventative care and treatment programs. There have been increased efforts to attract health professionals to isolated locations, such as increasing the number of medical students from rural areas and improving financial incentives for rural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1503/cmaj.070293|pmc=2211345|author=Rourke, J.|year=2008|title=Increasing the number of rural physicians|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=178|pages=322–325|pmid=18227453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadians living in rural areas and small towns have access to half as many physicians (1 per 1000 residents) as their urban counterparts. On average, these individuals have to travel five times the distance (an average of {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=x| [|]}})to access these services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ng, E.|author2=Wilkins, R.|author3=Pole, J.|author4=Adams, O.|year=1999|title=How far to the nearest physician|journal=Rural and Small Town Analysis Bulletin|volume=1|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have fewer specialized health care services such as dentists, dental surgeons, and [[social workers]]. One study found [[Emergency medical services|ambulance service]] was available in only 40% of the selected sites, [[blood testing|blood]] and [[urinalysis|Urine]] testing services in one third of the sites, and only one of the 19 sites had [[Neonatal intensive care unit|neonatal services]]. [[Nursing|Nursing service]] had reduced from 26.3% in 1998 to 21.1% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Halseth, G.|author2=Ryser, L.|url=http://www.jrcd.ca/include/getdoc.php?id=75&amp;article=48&amp;mode=pdf|year=2006|title=Trends in service delivery: Examples from rural and small town Canada, 1998 to 2005|journal=Journal of Rural and Community Development|volume=1|pages=69–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gap in services is due, in part, to the focus of funding on higher-population areas. In [[China]] only 10% of the rural population had [[medical insurance]] in 1993, compared with 50% of urban residents.&lt;ref name=brant2006&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Brant, S.|author2=Garris, M.|author3=Okeke, E.|author4=Rosenfeld, J.|url=http://www.umich.edu/~ipolicy/IEDP/2006china/1%29%20Access%20to%20Health%20Care%20in%20Rural%20China,%20A%20Policy%20Discussion.pdf|year=2006|title=Access to Care in Rural China: a Policy Discussion|publisher=The Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, University of Michigan|pages=1–19|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, only 20% of the government's [[Public health system|public health]] spending went to the rural health system, which served 70% of the Chinese population.&lt;ref name="brant2006"/&gt; In the United States, between 1990 and 2000, 228 rural hospitals closed, leading to a reduction of 8,228 hospital beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=U.S Department of Health and Human Services|year=2003|title=Trends in rural hospital closure 1990–2000|accessdate=February 19, 2008|url=http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-02-00610.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, patients living in rural areas of the United States were transferred to other facilities for care at a rate three times higher than that of patients in large central metropolitan areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kindermann|first=D|author2=Mutter, R |author3=Pines, JM |title=Emergency Department Transfers to Acute Care Facilities, 2009: Statistical Brief #155|date=February 2006|pmid=24006549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural areas, especially in Africa, have greater difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified and skilled professionals in the healthcare field.&lt;ref Name=TheWorldBank2008&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The World Bank|year=2008|title=Health Workers Needed: Poor Left Without Care in Africa’s Rural Areas|accessdate=February 27, 2009|url=http://go.worldbank.org/IUY3J2M0A0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], urban and more prosperous areas have disproportionately more of the countries’ skilled health care workers.&lt;ref Name="TheWorldBank2008"/&gt; For example, urban [[Zambia]] has 20 times more doctors and over five times more nurses and [[midwife|midwives]] than the rural areas. In [[Malawi]], 87% of its population lives in rural areas, but  96.6% of doctors are found in urban health facilities. [[Burkina Faso]] has one midwife per 8,000 inhabitants in richer zones, and one per nearly 430,000 inhabitants in the poorest zone.&lt;ref Name="TheWorldBank2008"/&gt; In [[South Africa]] alone, half of their population lives in rural areas, but only 12% of doctors actually practice there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Atlantic Philanthropies|year=2012|title=Bring Health Care Services to Rural Africa|accessdate=Dec 13, 2013|url=http://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/bringing-health-care-services-rural-south-africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; One solution has been to develop programs designed to train women to perform home-based health care for patients in Rural Africa. One such program is African Solutions to African Problems (ASAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=African Solutions to African Problems|year=2013|title=Health|accessdate=December 2, 2013|url=https://africansolutions.org/health/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working conditions===
Rural areas often have fewer job opportunities and higher unemployment rates than urban areas. The professions that are available are often physical in nature, including farming, forestry, fishing, manufacturing, and mining.&lt;ref name=BollmanBiggs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bollman|first=Ray D.|title=An Overview of Rural and Small Town Canada|journal=Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics|date=13 Nov 2008|volume=39|issue=4|pages=805–817|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7976.1991.tb03642.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S Congress, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; These occupations are often accompanied by greater health and safety hazards due to the use of complex machinery, exposure to chemicals, working hours, noise pollution, harsher climates, and physical labor. Rural work forces thus report higher rates of life-threatening injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9805522|author1=Gerberich S.G.|author2=Gibson, R.W.|author3=French, L.R.|author4=Lee, T.Y.|author5=Carr, W.P.|author6=Kochevar, L.|author7=Renier, C.M.|author8=Shutske, J.|year=1998|title=Machinery-related injuries: Regional Rural Injury Study-I (RRIS-I)|journal=Accident Analysis and Prevention|volume=30|pages=93–804|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10405669|pmc=1230438|author1=Pickett, W.|author2=Hartling, L.|author3=Brison, R.

===Personal health===
Lifestyle and personal health choices also affect the health and expected longevity of individuals in rural areas. Persons from rural areas report higher rates of smoking, exposure to second-hand smoke, and obesity than those in urban areas. Additionally, rural areas often have low rates of fruits and vegetable consumption even where farming is prevalent.&lt;ref name=initiative /&gt;

While homicide rates are lower in rural areas, death by injury, suicide and poisoning are significantly more prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Bryan|title=In Town vs. Country, It Turns Out That Cities Are the Safest Places to Live|url=http://science.time.com/2013/07/23/in-town-versus-country-it-turns-out-that-cities-are-the-safest-places-to-live/|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=Time|date=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Butterfield|first=Fox|title=Social Isolation, Guns and a 'Culture of Suicide'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/13/health/13rural.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare also reports higher rates of interpersonal violence in rural communities.&lt;ref name=welfare2005 /&gt;

===Physical environment===
In many countries a lack of critical infrastructure and development in rural areas can impair rural health. Insufficient [[wastewater]] treatment, lack of paved roads, and exposure to agricultural chemicals have been identified as additional environmental concerns for those living in rural locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aday, L. A.|author2=Quill, B. E.|author3=Reyes-Gibby, C. C.|year=2001|chapter=Equity in rural health and health care|editor1=Loue, Sana|editor2=Quill, B.E.|title=Handbook of Rural Health|location=New York City|publisher=Kluwer Academic-Penum Publishers|pages=45–72|isbn=9780306464799}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reports lower water quality and increased crowding of households as factors affecting disease control in rural and remote locations.&lt;ref name=welfare2005 /&gt;

==A Renewed Focus on Rural Health Worldwide==

=== National Systems ===
Since the mid-1980s, there has been increased attention on the discrepancies between healthcare outcomes between individuals in rural areas and those in urban areas. Since that time there has been increased funding by governments and non-governmental organizations to research rural health, provide needed medical services, and incorporate the needs of rural areas into governmental healthcare policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Era of Responsibility|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/fy2010_new_era/A_New_Era_of_Responsibility2.pdf|publisher=United States Office of Management and Budget}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphreys|first=J|author2=Hegney, D |author3=Lipscombe, J |author4=Gregory, G |author5= Chater, B |title=Whither rural health?

Research centers (such as the Center for Rural and Northern Health Research at [[Laurentian University]], the Center for Rural Health at the [[University of North Dakota]], and the RUPRI Center) and rural health advocacy groups (such as the [[National Rural Health Association]], National Organization of State Offices of Rural Health, [[National Rural Health Alliance]]) have been developed in several nations to inform and combat rural health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218092137/http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/798A711D-DC30-4E27-8DD6-19561EB969CC/0/ottawa_charter.pdf|archivedate=February 18, 2012|publisher=World Health Organization|title=Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion|date=November 21, 1986|conference=First International Conference on Health Promotion|accessdate=February 15, 2009|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/798A711D-DC30-4E27-8DD6-19561EB969CC/0/ottawa_charter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, many provinces have started to [[decentralize]] primary care and move towards a more regional approach. The [[Local Health Integration Network]] was established in [[Ontario, Canada|Ontario]] in 2007 order to address  the needs of the many Ontarians living in rural, northern, and remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Population health profile: North East LHIN|url=http://www.health.gov.on.ca/transformation/providers/information/resources/profiles/profile_northeast.pdf|location=North Bay, Ontario: North East LHIN|publisher=North East Local Health Integration Network|accessdate=January 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, a US $50 million pilot project was approved in 2008 to improve public health in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-10/20/content_7122784.htm|title=China launches rural health project|newspaper=China Daily|accessdate=March 2, 2009|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; China is also planning to introduce a national health care system.

===[[World Health Organization]]===
The WHO has done many studies on rural health statistics including for example, showing that urban heath centers score significantly higher in service readiness than rural health centers, and the population of health workers across India where on can see the comparative numbers of workers in urban vs rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Service readiness of health facilities in Bangladesh, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nepal, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/11/17-191916/en/|journal=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|doi=10.2471/BLT.17.191916|volume=95|year=2017|pages=738–748 | last1 = Leslie | first1 = Hannah H | last2 = Spiegelman | first2 = Donna | last3 = Zhou | first3 = Xin | last4 = Kruk | first4 = Margaret E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hrh/resources/hwindia_health-obs16/en/|title=The health workforce in India|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research studies like these exemplify the major problems needing attention in rural health systems and help lead to more impactful improvement projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/dg/speeches/2017/address-university-washington/en/|title=Grand challenges for the next decade in global health policy and programmes|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO also works on evaluation health system improvements  and proposing better health system improvements. An article published in March 2017 highlighted the large improvement to be made in the Solomon Islands health system in a plain laid out by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, supported by the WHO. These large scale changes move to bring health services need by the rural population "closer to home".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/features/2017/health-solomon-islands/en/|title=Health closer to home: transforming care in the Solomon Islands|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non Governmental Organizations ([[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]) ===
Lack of government intervention in failing health systems has led to the need for NGOs to fill the void in many rural health care systems. NGOs create and participate in rural health projects worldwide.

==== Rural Health Projects ====
Rural health improvement projects world wide tend to focus on finding solutions to the three basic problems associated with a rural health system. These problems center around communication, transportation of services and goods, and lack of doctors, nurses, and general staff.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strasser|first=Roger|date=2003-08-01|title=Rural health around the world: challenges and solutions*|url=https://academic.oup.com/fampra/article/20/4/457/625248|journal=Family Practice|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=457–463|doi=10.1093/fampra/cmg422|issn=0263-2136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====[[Telemedicine]] and rural health=====
For residents of rural areas, the lengthy travel time and distance to larger, more developed urban and metropolitan health centers present significant restrictions on access to essential health care services.  [[Telemedicine]] has been suggested as a way of overcoming transportation barriers for patients and health care providers in rural and geographically isolated areas. According to the Health Resources Services Administration, telemedicine may be defined as the use of electronic information and telecommunication technologies to support long-distance healthcare and clinical relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Telehealth use in Rural Healthcare.

In rural communities, medical professionals may utilize pre-recorded lectures for medical or health care students at remote sites.&lt;ref name="rose" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hun" /&gt; Also, healthcare practitioners in urban and metropolitan areas may utilize teleconferences and diagnostic simulations to assist understaffed healthcare centers in rural communities diagnose and treat patients from a distance.&lt;ref name="bambi" /&gt; In a study of rural Queensland health systems, more developed urban health centers used video-conferencing to educate rural physicians on treatment and diagnostic advancements for breast and prostate cancer, as well as various skin disorders, such as eczema and chronic irritations.&lt;ref name="bambi" /&gt; Thirdly, telemedicine may pose significant administrative benefits to rural areas.&lt;ref name="rose" /&gt; Not only does telemedicine aid in the collaboration among health providers with regard to the utilization of electronic medical records, but telemedicine may pose benefits for interviewing medical professionals in remote areas for position vacancies and the transmission of necessary operation-related information between rural health systems and larger, more developed healthcare systems.&lt;ref name="hun" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bambi" /&gt;

[[Image:Seal of Solomon (Simple Version).svg|thumb|One simple form of the Seal{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}]]
[[File:Moroccan 4 Falus Coin (AH 1290).jpg|thumb|A hexagram on the obverse of Moroccan 4 falus coin, dated AH 1290 (AD 1873/4).
The current [[flag of Morocco]], introduced in 1915 (r. [[Yusef of Morocco|Yusef]]) displays a green [[pentagram]] in reference to Solomon.]]The '''Seal of Solomon''' (or '''Ring of Solomon'''; {{lang-ar|خاتم سليمان}} ''{{transl|ar|Khātam Sulaymān}}'') is the [[signet ring]] attributed to [[King Solomon]] in medieval Jewish tradition and in Islamic and [[Western occultism]]. It was often depicted in either a [[pentagram]] or [[hexagram]] shape; the latter also known as the [[Star of David]] in Jewish tradition.

This  ring  variously gave Solomon the power to command demons,  [[jinn]] (genie), or to speak with animals.
Due to the proverbial [[wisdom]] of Solomon, his signet ring, or its supposed design, it came to be seen as an   [[amulet]] or [[talisman]], or a [[symbol]] or [[character (symbol)|character]]  in medieval and Renaissance-era [[Renaissance magic|magic]], [[occultism]], and [[alchemy]].

The legend of the Seal of Solomon was developed primarily by medieval Arabic writers, who related that the ring was engraved by [[tetragrammaton|God]] and was given to the king directly from heaven. The ring was made from brass and iron, and the two parts were used to seal written commands to good and evil spirits, respectively.  In one tale, a demon, either ''[[Asmodeus]]'', or ''Sakhr'', obtained possession of the ring and ruled in Solomon's stead for forty days. In a variant of the  tale of the ring of [[Polycrates]] from [[Herodotus]], the demon eventually threw the ring into the sea,  where it was swallowed by a fish, caught by a fisherman, and served to Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=895&amp;letter=S "Solomon" ], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]: "Solomon is represented as having authority over spirits, animals, wind, and water, all of which obeyed his orders by virtue of a magic ring set with the four jewels given him by the angels that had power over these four realms.  [...] It was Solomon's custom to take off the ring when he was about to wash, and to give it to one of his wives, Amina, to hold. On one occasion, when the ring was in Amina's keeping, the rebellious spirit Sakhr took on Solomon's form and obtained the ring. He then seated himself on the throne and ruled for forty days, during which time the real king wandered about the country, poor and forlorn. On the fortieth day Sakhr dropped the ring into the sea; there it was swallowed by a fish, which was caught by a poor fisherman and given to Solomon for his supper. Solomon cut open the fish, found the ring, and returned to power. His forty days' exile had been sent in punishment for the idolatry practised in his house for forty days, although unknown to him, by one of his wives" [[Baidawi|Baiḍawi]], ii. 187; [[History of the Prophets and Kings|Ṭabri, "Annales,"]] ed. De Goeje, i. 592 et seq.)."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islamic eschatology]], the [[Beast of the Earth]] is equipped with both the [[Staff of Moses]] and the Seal of Solomon and uses the latter to stamp the nose of the [[Kafir|unbelievers]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean Anthony, ''The Caliph and the Heretic: Ibn Saba' and the Origins of Shi`ism'', 2011, 
[https://books.google.ch/books?id=jeYxAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA220 p. 220].&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The date of origin legends surrounding the Seal of Solomon is difficult to establish. 
It is known that a legend of a [[magic ring]] with which the possessor could command demons was already current in the 1st century ([[Josephus]] 8.2 telling of one Eleazar who used such a ring in the presence of [[Vespasian]]), but the association of the name of Solomon with such a ring is medieval notwithstanding the 2nd century apocryphal text the [[Testament of Solomon]].
The [[Nashim|Tractate Gittin]] (fol. 68) of the [[Mishnah]] has a story involving Solomon, Asmodeus, and a ring with the divine name engraved.&lt;ref&gt;
The story involves Solomon giving a ring and a chain to one Benaiahu son of Jehoiada to catch the demon Ashmedai, using the demon's help to build the temple; Ashmedai later tricks Solomon into giving him the ring and swallows it.
"Solomon thereupon sent thither Benaiahu son of Jehoiada, giving him a chain on which was graven the [Divine] Name and a ring on which was graven the Name and fleeces of wool and bottles of wine. Benaiahu went and dug a pit lower down the hill and let the water flow into it13  and stopped [the hollow] With the fleeces of wool, and he then dug a pit higher up and poured the wine into it14  and then filled up the pits. He then went and sat on a tree. When Ashmedai came he examined the seal, then opened the pit and found it full of wine. He said, it is written, Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler, and whosoever erreth thereby is not wise,15  and it is also written, Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding.16  I will not drink it. Growing thirsty, however, he could not resist, and he drank till he became drunk, and fell asleep. Benaiahu then came down and threw the chain over him and fastened it. When he awoke he began to struggle, whereupon he [Benaiahu] said, The Name of thy Master is upon thee, the Name of thy Master is upon thee. [...] Solomon kept him [Ashmedai] with him until he had built the Temple. One day when he was alone with him, he said, it is written, He hath as it were to'afoth and re'em ["the strength of a wild ox"],   and we explain that to'afoth means the ministering angels and re'em means the demons. What is your superiority over us?  He said to him, Take the chain off me and give me your ring, and I will show you. So he took the chain off him and gave him the ring. He then swallowed him, [viz. "it", the ring]  and placing one wing on the earth and one on the sky he hurled him four hundred parasangs. In reference to that incident Solomon said, What profit is there to a man in all his labour wherein he laboureth under the sun." [http://www.halakhah.com/gittin/gittin_68.html trans. M. Simon].
&lt;/ref&gt;

The specification of the design of the seal as   a [[hexagram]]   seems to arise from a medieval Arab tradition.
The name "Solomon's seal" was given to the hexagram engraved on the bottom of drinking-cups in Arab tradition. In the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' (chapter 20), [[Sindbad]] presented [[Harun al-Rashid]] with such a cup, on which the "Table of Solomon" was engraved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward William Lane|Lane]], "Arabian Nights" (1859; 1883), note 93 to chapter 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Hexagrams feature prominently in Jewish esoteric literature from the early medieval period, and some authors have hypothesized that the tradition of Solomon's Seal may possibly predate Islam and date to early Rabbinical esoteric tradition, or to early alchemy in [[Hellenistic Judaism]] in [[Roman Egypt|3rd-century Egypt]], but there is no positive evidence for this, and most scholars assume that the symbol entered the [[Kabbalistic]] tradition of medieval Spain from Arabic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Leonora Leet , "The Hexagram and Hebraic Sacred Science" in :''The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah'', 1999, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=61hpoogearsC&amp;pg=PA212 212-217].&lt;/ref&gt;
The representation as a [[pentagram]], by contrast, seems to arise in the Western tradition of [[Renaissance magic]] (which was in turn strongly influenced by medieval Arab and Jewish occultism); [[White Kennett]] (1660–1728) makes reference to a "pentangle of Solomon" with the power of exorcising demons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13843-solomon-seal-of "Solomon, Seal of"], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hexagram or "[[Star of David]]", which became a symbol of Judaism in the modern period and was placed on the [[flag of Israel]] in 1948, 
has its origins in 14th-century depictions of the Seal of Solomon. 
In 1354, [[King of Bohemia]] [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] prescribed for the Jews of [[Prague]] a red flag with both David's shield and Solomon's seal, while the red flag with which the Jews met [[King Matthias]] of Hungary in the 15th century showed two pentagrams with two golden stars.&lt;ref&gt;Schwandtner, ''Scriptores Rerum Hungaricarum,'' ii. 148. Facsimile in M. Friedmann, ''Seder Eliyahu Rabbah ve-Seder Eliyahu Ztṭa,'' Vienna, 1901&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pietro d'Abano|Peter de Abano's]]  ''Heptameron'' (1496) makes reference to the "Pentacle of Solomon" (actually a hexagram drawn on the floor in which the magician has to stand) to invoke various demons.&lt;ref&gt;''Per Pentaculum Salomonis advocavi, dent mihi responsum verum''; [http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/heptamer.htm Heptameron], ed.  [[Agrippa von Nettesheim]],  '' Henrici Cornelii Agrippae liber qvartvs De occvlta philosophia, seu de cerimonijs magicis'', 1565.   ed: Heinrich Cornelius,   Karl Anton Nowotny. ''De occulta philosophia''. Graz: Akademische Druck u. Verlagsanstalt, 1967, digital edition by Joseph H. Peterson,  1998, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lippmann Moses Büschenthal]]  (d. 1818) wrote a tragedy with the title ''Der Siegelring Salomonis'' ("the signet-ring of Solomon"). An "[[Order of the Seal of Solomon]]" was established in 1874 in [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], where the [[Solomonic dynasty|ruling house]] claimed descent from Solomon. 

What distinguishes a Seal of Solomon from a Star of David is the two triangles are interlaced giving the appearance of a 3-dimensional figure. This was said in the [[Testament of Solomon]] to make demons confused and dizzy, unable to do Solomon any harm.

'''''Shamans: Siberian Spirituality and the Western Imagination''''' is a [[history|historical]] study of how westerners have viewed the [[shamanism|shamans]] of [[Siberia]]. It was written by the English historian [[Ronald Hutton]], then working at the [[University of Bristol]], and first published by [[Hambledon and London]] in 2001. Prior to writing ''Shamans'', Hutton had authored a series of books on such subjects as Early Modern Britain, pre-Christian religion, British folklore and [[Paganism (contemporary)|Contemporary Paganism]].

The book is divided into three sections. The first, entitled "Why we think we know about shamans", looks at how Russians and other westerners have understood Siberia and its shamanic practitioners from the Middle Ages to the present day. Specifically, it looks at how the concept of Siberia was created by the invading Russians, and how the governments of the [[Russian Empire]] and then the [[Soviet Union]] interacted with the many ethnic groups who lived there, and how they dealt with its indigenous shamanic beliefs. In the second section, "What we think we know about shamans", he proceeds to highlight the difficulty with the concept of shamanism, which has never been definitively defined by scholars. He goes on to explore the various traits associated with shamanic beliefs and practices in Siberia, looking at [[cosmology]], equipment and costume, and their ritual performances; throughout, he emphasises the great diversity among the shamans of this region. In the third and final section, "Siberia in the shamanic world", Hutton looks at the historical development of shamanic beliefs both in Siberia and outside of it, in other parts of Eurasia. Finally, he turns his attention to the current state of shamanism in Siberia and the influence of [[Neoshamanism]].

Academic reviews published in peer-reviewed journals such as ''[[The Folklore Society|Folklore]]'' and the ''Journal for the Academic Study of Magic'' were predominantly positive. The archaeologist [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]] however noted a problem in Hutton's discussion of shamanistic beliefs in Scandinavia.

==Background==
Born in 1953, Ronald Hutton studied History at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], before going on for postgraduate study at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. In 1981, he was hired as a Reader in History at the [[University of Bristol]], where he wrote a series of four books devoted to 17th century Britain. In 1991, he published his first study of pre-Christian religion, ''[[The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles]]'', based on his longstanding interest in British archaeology. He followed this with two studies of British folkloric customs, ''The Rise and Fall of Merry England'' (1994) and ''The Stations of the Sun'' (1996), and then a history of [[Wicca]], entitled ''[[The Triumph of the Moon]]'' (1999). With ''Shamans'' he continued his research into pre-Christian religious beliefs and the manner in which they altered and interacted following Christianisation.

==Synopsis==
In the introduction, Hutton notes that since the 1970s, four distinct definitions of "shamanism" have been adopted by [[anthropology|anthropologists]] and scholars of [[religious studies]]. The first holds that shamanism refers to any practice in which an individual "contacts a spirit world while in an [[altered state of consciousness]]." The second reserves the term for those professionals who perform such practices at the request of others. A third definition attempts to distinguish shamans from other magico-religious specialists such as "[[mediumship|mediums]]", "[[witch doctors]]", "spiritual healers" and "prophets" by certain techniques; Hutton notes that this is the definition most commonly used by modern scholars. The fourth definition makes use of the term purely to refer to the religious beliefs of Siberia and neighbouring parts of Asia, but Hutton criticises such a definition, considering it illogical.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. vii&amp;ndash;ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part One: Why we think we know about shamans===
Chapter one, "The Creation of Siberia", looks at how the region of [[Siberia]] in central and eastern Russia first came to be defined by the Europeans living in the west. Hutton then discusses the immense size of the region, its climate and also its geography.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. 03–08.&lt;/ref&gt; The second chapter, entitled "The Creation of Shamans", looks at how the Russian authorities came to categorise the [[indigenous peoples of Siberia]], transforming 120 distinct linguistic groups into 35 "nationalities" for the purposes of ruling over them. It proceeds to discuss the cultural and ethnic genocide of Siberian native groups by the Russian government, and then highlights the great flexibility and change that occurred within indigenous Siberian society over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. 09–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Witsen's Shaman.JPG|thumb|left|300px|The earliest known depiction of a Siberian shaman, produced by the Dutch explorer [[Nicolaes Witsen]], who authored an account of his travels among Samoyedic- and Tungusic-speaking peoples in 1692. Witsen labelled the illustration as a "Priest of the Devil" and gave this figure clawed feet to highlight his demonic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the third chapter, "The Transformation of Siberians", Hutton discusses the Russian conquest of Siberia, which largely took place between  ''circa'' 1580 and 1650. He highlights the economic reasons for the invasion, which were largely the result of the [[fur trade]], and notes that under Russian rule, the overall population of indigenous peoples in Siberia increased. He goes on to discuss how the increasing eastward migration of European populations from Russia affected the natives, as well as examining the impact of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Buddhism]], all foreign religions which were introduced and interacted with the indigenous Siberian beliefs, often creating a syncretic blend. In the last part of the chapter, he looks at the persecution of shamans and other indigenous magico-religious practitioners by both Christian Russian authorities and later the Marxist–Leninist administration of the [[Soviet Union]], noting that such traditional practices had been entirely eradicated by the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. 15–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth chapter, "The Records of Shamanism", deals with the many European accounts of shamanic and related practices in Siberia. Hutton opens it by reference to [[Marco Polo]]'s 13th-century account of a magico-religious practitioner in south-west China, which bore similarities with later accounts from neighbouring Mongolia and Siberia. Carrying on with this approach, he refers to the Franciscan friar [[William of Rubruck]]'s 1254 account of a Mongol magician. He then discusses the earliest European account of Siberian shamans, produced by the Englishman Richard Johnson in 1557, and the later 1692 account by Dutchman [[Nicolaes Witsen]]. Moving on, Hutton looks at various 18th-century accounts, most of which were produced by scientists sent by the Russian government to report on the human and natural resources of the Siberian region, and highlights the negative attitude in which they discuss the shamans, largely viewing them as tricksters and con men. Hutton proceeds to discuss the emergence of [[anthropology]] and the manner in which anthropologists began to study the shamans of Siberia, explaining that they usually took a more sympathetic attitude than their predecessors. He finally deals with the role of Soviet anthropologists in not only documenting the vestiges of shamanism, but also aiding in its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. 29–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part Two: What we think we know about shamans===
[[Image:SB - Altay shaman with drum.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Russian postcard based on a photo taken in 1908 by S. I. Borisov, showing a female shaman, of probable [[Khakas people|Khakas]] ethnicity.]]
Chapter five, "What Shamans Did", offers Hutton's exploration of what can be said for certain about the shamans of Siberia. He notes that the term "shaman" was a "crude" label that has been used to refer to a wide variety of different magico-religious practitioners within the Siberian region, and also highlights the fact that the role of the shaman was rarely central to Indigenous Siberian religion. He emphasises that among different tribal groups, shamans served different individuals, and performed different functions in society, although were typically involved in healing and divinatory practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. 47–58.&lt;/ref&gt; In the sixth chapter, entitled "Shamanic Cosmologies", Hutton notes that there were three cosmological concepts widespread among Indigenous Siberians: "the beliefs that even apparently inanimate objects were inhabited by spirit-forms; that the world was structured on a number of different levels; and that living beings possessed more than one 'soul' or animating force." Noting that scholars can only truly discuss shamanism based on evidence from the 19th and 20th centuries, when such beliefs had already begun to syncretically mix with incoming foreign religious movements, he then goes on to discuss the myriad different types of spirit assistants found in the cosmologies of Siberia. Throughout this, he emphasises the huge variation within the Siberian region, with different cultural and ethnic groups holding different beliefs about the structure of the cosmos and the relationship between the shaman and those spirits with whom they worked. Criticising the Romanian historian of religion [[Mircea Eliade]] for claiming that all Siberian shamans controlled spirits rather than being possessed and controlled by them, Hutton provides evidence to the contrary, highlighting that in certain areas, shamans simply placated spirits rather than controlling them. He then goes on to discuss the [[Scientific realism|western rationalist]] view that the spirits worked with by shamans were actually [[altered states of consciousness|altered states of mind]] existing within the shaman's imagination.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. 59-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter seven, "Shamanic Apprenticeship and Equipment", explores the nature of hereditary apprenticeships among Siberian shamans, as well as looking at the concept of a "shamanic illness" through which the individual had to undergo great suffering before they could gain their powers. Exploring the training of a shaman, Hutton criticises Eliade's idea that a vision of death and rebirth was universally intrinsic to shamanism, highlighting that it wasn't even found across the entirety of Siberia, let alone the world. Instead, he states that the "truly universal pattern" was that of the "period of withdrawal" that the trainee shaman undertook before entering the profession, when their [[rite of passage]] would come to an end and they would be recognised by both pre-existing shamans and their clientele. Moving on to a discussion of paraphernalia and costume, he argues that the inclusion of at least one shamanic item was standard across Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. 68&amp;ndash;83.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eighth chapter, "Shamanic Performance", Hutton describes Siberian shamans as "performing artists", although notes that there was great variation in what these performances actually entailed. Discussing whether some of their performances were improvised, he then looks at the involvement of either apprentices or specialist shamanic assistants. Exploring the role of the audience, he then rounds off the chapter by looking at the alleged superhuman feats that shamans could perform &amp;ndash; such as levitation and acts of extreme self-harm &amp;ndash; and while explaining that some of these can be shown to be illusions, in the case of others, he remarks that the explanation remains a "disturbingly open question."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. 85&amp;ndash;98.&lt;/ref&gt; In the final chapter of Part Two, "Knots and Loose Ends", Hutton explores a variety of different elements to shamanism in Siberia. Discussing the role of payment, he highlights that in some areas, shamans were always paid for their services, but that in others it was customary for them to give their aid for free; for this reason he considers Siberian shamanism to be "a vocation rather than a profession". Proceeding to discuss the role of [[entheogens]] in Siberian shamanism, he supports Eliade's position that they were only rarely used. Highlighting that there is limited evidence for either shamanic beliefs in [[shape shifting]] or in spirit tracks in Siberian shamanism, he then moves on to explore concepts of [[biological sex]] and [[gender]]. Arguing that in recorded contexts, men rather than women were usually dominant within the shamanic vocation, Hutton then explores the existence of [[transgender]] or [[third gender]] shamans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. 99&amp;ndash;110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenth chapter, "The Discovery of a Shamanic World", deals with the origins of Siberian shamanism, exploring both of the primary theories that have been put forward; that shamanism in Siberia has its origins in prehistory, or that it developed in the Middle Ages as Siberian indigenous religion adopted elements of Buddhism. Although highlighting that both are possible, Hutton maintains that the first is more plausible because of the existence of similar shamanic beliefs in northern Scandinavia, far from Buddhist influence. Exploring the [[etymology]] of the word "shaman", he then looks at the different approaches adopted by historians studying Siberian shamanism, beginning with the [[Marxism|Marxist]] approach adopted by Soviet scholars in the 20th century. Moving on to discuss the [[comparative religion|comparative religious]] approach taken by Mircea Eliade in his seminal study, ''[[Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy]]'', Hutton remains highly critical of Eliade's work, and his theory that shamanism was an early form of global [[Palaeolithic]] religion. He finally moves on to examine the work of [[Ioan Lewis]] on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. 113&amp;ndash;127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter eleven, "The Discovery of a Shamanic Past", explores scholarly arguments for the existence of shamanism in European prehistory and history, focusing in on such regions as the ancient Near East and ancient Greece, before looking at shamanistic elements in the [[cave art]] of the Upper Palaeolithic and the comparisons with South African artworks that have been made by the archaeologist [[David Lewis-Williams]]. Exploring potential post-Palaeolithic survivals of shamanism in Europe, he looks at the idea that shamanistic elements can be detected in [[Neolithic]] art or in Early Mediaeval Welsh and Irish literature. He then looks at the existence of shamanism among the [[Saami people]] of northern Scandinavia. In the latter part of the chapter, Hutton explores the theories that shamanistic elements survived in parts of Southern Europe into the Early Modern period, looking at the ideas of historians [[Éva Pócs]] and Gabór Klaniczay that the Hungarian ''[[táltos]]'' continued in a shamanic tradition, as well as the ideas of [[Carlo Ginzburg]] regarding the Italian ''[[benandanti]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. 129&amp;ndash;149.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final chapter, "The Discovery of a Shamanic Future", Hutton reminisces about his own travels in the Soviet Union during the 1980s, noting how most of those he talked to were either reluctant to discuss shamanism or were dismissive of the subject. He contrasts this with the contemporary situation in the [[Russian Federation]], where shamanism is once more being talked about in a positive manner by Siberian Indigenous leaders wishing to reclaim and reassert their cultural and religious heritage. Discussing any possible genuine survivals of shamanism into the 1980s and even into the post-Soviet period, he also looks at the development of the [[Neoshamanism|Neoshamanic]] movement in the [[western world]], and the way in which various Siberians have adopted neoshamanism and claimed it as the genuine continuance of Siberian shamanism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. 151&amp;ndash;162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic reception and recognition==

===Academic reviews===
In his review for the academic ''Folklore'' journal, Jonathan Roper of the [[University of Sheffield]] noted that the work "could profitably have been twice as long and have provided a more extended treatment of the issues involved" and that it suffered from a lack of images. On the whole however he thought it "certainly [should] be recommended to readers as an important work" on the subject of shamanism, and he hoped that Hutton would "return to treat this fascinating topic in even greater depth in future."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rop02|Roper 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shamans'' was also reviewed by Neil L. Inglis in the ''Journal for the Academic Study of Magic''. Inglis proclaimed Hutton's work to be "that special gem", a work that can have a wide appeal despite its specialist nature. Outlining a synopsis of the book, he rounds off his review not by reference to it, but by exclaiming that there is much that we still fail to understand about shamanism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ing04|Inglis 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular reviews===
On his website, the book reviewer Anthony Campbell turned his attention to Hutton's ''Shamans'', describing it as a "sympathetic" discussion of the topic. Considering Hutton to be "something of a [[cultural relativism|cultural relativist]]", he highlights his suspicion that Hutton believes the shamanic claim that they have genuine abilities to contact the spirit world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cam08|Campbell 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider influence===
Writing in his pioneering study of Norse magical practices, ''[[The Viking Way (book)|The Viking Way: Religion and War in Late Iron Age Scandinavia]]'' (2002), the English archaeologist [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]] briefly discussed Hutton's ''Shamans'' in his own summary of published studies of shamanism. Remarking that the book offered an "excellent study" of Siberian religion, Price however believed that Hutton had been "woefully misinformed about the Scandinavian source material" regarding ''[[Seiðr]]'', or Norse magic. He criticised Hutton for treating Norse and Sámi practices as a "seamless continuum", and for incorrectly asserting that ''Eiríks saga rauða'' contained the sole reference to a ''[[vǫlva]]'' within Old Norse literature. Price lamented that on this occasion, Hutton's "usually exemplary scholarship" had been "spread a little thin."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pri02|Price 2002]]. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''soul cake''', also known as a '''soulmass-cake''', is a small round [[cake]] which is traditionally made for [[Halloween|All Hallows' Eve]], [[All Saints' Day]] and [[All Souls' Day]] to commemorate the dead in the Christian tradition.&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simoons|first=Frederick J.|title=Plants of Life, Plants of Death|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin Press]]|year=1998|isbn=0-299-15904-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cakes, often simply referred to as souls, are given out to soulers (mainly consisting of children and the poor) who go from door to door during the days of [[Allhallowtide]] singing and saying [[Christian prayer|prayers]] "for the souls of the givers and their friends".&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt; The practice in England dates to the medieval period,&lt;ref name="Carmichael2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carmichael|first=Sherman|title=Legends and Lore of South Carolina|year=2012|publisher=[[The History Press]]|language=English |isbn=9781609497484|page=70|quote=The practice of dressing up and going door to door for treats dates back to the middle ages and the practice of souling.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was continued there until the 1930s,&lt;ref name="Hood2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hood|first=Karen Jean Matsko|title=Halloween Delights|date=1 January 2014|publisher=Whispering Pine Press International|language=English |isbn=9781594341816|page=33|quote=The tradition continued in some areas of northern England as late as the 1930s, with children going from door to door “souling” for cakes or money by singing a song.}}&lt;/ref&gt; by both Protestant and Catholic Christians.&lt;ref name=Mosteller&gt;{{cite book|last=Mosteller|first=Angie |title=Christian Origins of Halloween |date=2 July 2014|publisher=Rose Publishing |language=English |isbn=1596365358|quote=In Protestant regions souling remained an important occasion for soliciting food and money from rich neighbors in preparation for the coming cold and dark months.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;{{cite book|title=[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]|editor=[[Mary Mapes Dodge]]|year=1883|publisher=Scribner &amp; Company|language=English |page=93|quote="Soul-cakes," which the rich gave to the poor at the Halloween season, in return for which the recipients prayed for the souls of the givers and their friends.

The tradition of giving soul cakes was celebrated in [[Great Britain|Britain]] or [[Ireland]] during the [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first =Nicholas |last =Rogers |title =Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night |publisher =Oxford University Press |year =2002 |pages =28–30 |isbn =0-19-514691-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; although similar practices for the souls of the dead were found as far south as Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Castella |first=Krystina |title=A World of Cakes: 150 Receipes for Sweet Traditions from Cultures Near and Far |year=2010 |publisher=Storey Publishing |isbn=978-1-60342-576-6 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cakes are usually filled with [[allspice]], [[nutmeg]], [[cinnamon]], [[ginger]] or other sweet spices, [[raisins]] or [[Zante currant|currant]]s, and before baking are topped with the mark of a cross to signify that these were [[alms]].  They were traditionally set out with glasses of wine, an offering for the dead as in early Christian tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Eason, Cassandra  (1997)  The Mammoth Book of Ancient Wisdom.

==Souling==
[[File:Souling on Halloween.png|thumb|Souling was a Christian practice carried out in many English towns on [[Halloween]] and [[Christmas]].]]
Souling is a Christian practice carried out during [[Allhallowtide]] and [[Christmastide]]. The custom was popular in England and is still practised to a minor extent in Sheffield and Cheshire during [[Allhallowtide]]. The custom was also popular in Wales and has counterparts in the Philippines and Portugal that are practiced to this day.&lt;ref name="Fieldhouse2017"/&gt;

According to Morton (2013), Souling was once performed throughout the British Isles and the earliest activity was reported in 1511.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Lisa (2013) Trick or Treat: A History of Halloween.Reaktion Books [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h6vDoVs5aioC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=lisa+morton+trick+or+treat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibt8Tv2dbeAhXKKcAKHUmTAz0Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=caking&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of the 19th century, the extent of the practice during [[Allhallowtide]] was limited to parts of England and Wales.

According to Gregory (2010), Souling involved a group of people visiting local farms and cottages. The merrymakers would sing a "traditional request for apples, ale, and soul cakes.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, David (2010) The Late Victorian Folksong Revival: The Persistence of English Melody, 1878-1903 Scarecrow Press  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xMoCmsn4UGYC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=souling+oswestry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwicsZCUxsneAhXRN8AKHQobCEAQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=souling%20oswestry&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The songs were traditionally known as Souler's songs and were sung in a lamentable tone during the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Fleische (1826) An Appendix to His Dramatic Works.

====Traditions====
[[File:TurnipJackolantern.jpg|thumb|right|Turnip lantern]]
According to Harrowven (1979), Souling is "a fusion of pagan and Christian ritual".&lt;ref&gt;Harrowven, Jean, (1979) The Origins of Rhymes, Songs and Sayings. Kaye &amp; Ward [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pMvXAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%27Soul+cake%27+is+again+a+fusion+of+pagan+and+Christian+ritual&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%27Soul+cake%27+]&lt;/ref&gt; The customs associated with Souling during [[Allhallowtide]] include or included consuming and/or distributing soul cakes, singing, carrying lanterns, dressing in disguise, bonfires, playing divination games, carrying a horse's head and performing plays.

As an alternative to bonfires, in Lancashire, candles were carried between 11 pm and midnight on Halloween in a procession up the hills in a custom known as 'lating the witches'.

=====Old Hob=====
In some parts of Cheshire, during the 19th century, adults and children went Souling performing plays and carrying an Old Hob which consisted of a horse's head enveloped in a sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the British Archaeological Association (1850)  British Archaeological Association [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Kh4pAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=chester+souling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQy5W1887eAhWIxYsKHQ3bAoM4ChDoAQhMMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=chester%20souling&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The head would be put on a pole and sometimes, a candle would be lit inside, in which case the pole bearer would be covered in a sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Cuhulain, Kerr  (2011) Pagan Religions: A Handbook for Diversity Training.

====Modern observances====
By the latter half of the 19th century, states Simpson (1976), it was more usual for children to go out Souling. Further, by the 19th century, memories of begging for bread "for the sake of souls  departed" had faded, "leaving  only the name soul-cake".&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Jacqueline  (1976) The Folklore of the Welsh Border. B. T. Batsford[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=c86BAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=souling++iona&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=souling]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The educational reforms of 1870 meant that children, other than very small children, went to school which was when Souling would be carried by children and this affected the extent of the practice. However, the custom persisted in "rural Cheshire, northern Shropshire and adjoining part of Staffordshire" up to the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald (2001) Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain.

They visit the houses and sing one or other of the traditional Souling-songs, and are then rewarded with gifts of money, or cakes, or sweets".&lt;ref&gt;Hole, Christina (1975) English Traditional Customs.

=====Souling plays=====
[[File:Antrobus Soul Cakers.jpg|thumb|right|Antrobus Soul Cakers (Cheshire)]]
In the county of Cheshire, Souling plays were traditionally performed. This involved groups of soulers visiting farmhouses performing a death and resurrection play. One of the members would wear a horse-skull without which the play could not be performed.&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, Ben (2010) Trials of the Moon: Reopening the Case for Historical Witchcraft.

A link between Souling and the deceased was made by Wilfred Isherwood, leader of the Antrobus cast, when he said in 1954 that they believed in Souling and ghosts.&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, Ben (2010) Trials of the Moon: Reopening the Case for Historical Witchcraft.

Rogers (2003) believes  Souling took place in Monmouth and Caenarvonshire in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Nicholas (2003) Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night. Oxford University Press.

Parishioners donated the candles and "when they were lit, the way in which the flame burned, faintly or brightly, would serve as a prognosis of the future". The ceremony also involved preparing sole cakes which were known as pice rhanna.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Anne (2001) Folklore of Wales.

Souling was known as hel solod and hel bwyd cennady meirw, "collecting the food of the messenger of the dead". This custom took place in many parts of Wales on All Souls' Eve. In 1823, it was noted that there was a tradition in Wales for the messenger, known as cennad ymeirw, to knock on doors and say 'Deca, Deca, dowch i'r drws, a rhowch . . . igennady meirw'. [Deca, Deca, come to the door... and give to the messenger of death].

===Versions===
In 1891, Rev. M. P. Holme of Tattenhall, Cheshire, collected the song traditionally sung during souling, from a little girl at the local school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=E. David |title=The Late Victorian Folklore Revival |year=2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-6988-2 |page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the text and tune were published by folklorist [[Lucy Broadwood]], who commented that souling was still practised at that time in Cheshire and Shropshire.&lt;ref name="Broadwood"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Lucy Etheldred |last1=Broadwood |authorlink1=Lucy Broadwood|first2=John Alexander |last2=Fuller-Maitland |title=English County Songs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_c4AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PA30 |year=1893|publisher=Leadenhall Press|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further recordings of the traditional soul-cake song were collected in various parts of England until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.efdss.org/cgi-bin/query.cgi?index_roud=on&amp;output=List&amp;op=precise&amp;query=304&amp;field=20&amp;output=List&amp;length=50&amp;submit=Submit+query |title=Roud Folksong Index entry on "Souling Song (Roud 304)" |publisher=Ralph Vaughan Williams Memorial Library, English Folk Dance and Song Society |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604104605/http://library.efdss.org/cgi-bin/query.cgi?index_roud=on&amp;output=List&amp;op=precise&amp;query=304&amp;field=20&amp;output=List&amp;length=50&amp;submit=Submit+query |archivedate=2012-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Versions collected later may have been influenced by folk revival recordings of the song by such groups as [[The Watersons]].

The 1891 version contains a chorus and three verses:&lt;ref name="Broadwood"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
[Chorus]
A soul! a soul! a soul-cake!
Please good Missis, a soul-cake!
An apple, a pear, a plum, or a cherry,
Any good thing to make us all merry.
One for Peter, two for Paul
Three for Him who made us all.

[Verse 1]
God bless the master of this house, 
The misteress also, 
And all the little children 
That round your table grow. 
Likewise young men and maidens, 
Your cattle and your store ; 
And all that dwells within your gates, 
We wish you ten times more.

[Verse 2]
Down into the cellar, 
And see what you can find, 
If the barrels are not empty, 
We hope you will prove kind. 
We hope you will prove kind, 
With your apples and strong beer, 
And we'll come no more a-souling 
Till this time next year.

[Verse 3]
The lanes are very dirty, 
My shoes are very thin, 
I've got a little pocket 
To put a penny in. 
If you haven't got a penny, 
A ha'penny will do ; 
If you haven't get a ha'penny, 
It's God bless you&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
In 1963, the American folk group [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] recorded this as "A' Soalin", including all the verses as well as parts of "Hey, Ho, Nobody Home" and "God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen" (which are traditionally associated with Christmas). The musical arrangement (including the accompaniment, chords, and interpolations from the other traditional songs) is quite different from the published 1893 version and was copyrighted by members of the group.&lt;ref name="Keyes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genekeyes.com/Souling/Souling.html |title=The Souling Song [Soul-Cake] |year=2014 |publisher=Gene Keyes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[Hallowe'en]] composer [[Kristen Lawrence]] found two historical tunes associated with soul cakes as she was researching souling songs for her 2009 ''A Broom With A View'' album.  As Lawrence heard the traditional Cheshire tune, she was struck that the beginning notes were the same as the mediaeval [[plainchant]] [[Dies Irae]], "Day of Judgment", calling the people to repent and pray for the dead. It seemed plausible that the Cheshire tune could be a folk corruption of the chant as children and beggars asked for cakes in return for praying for the dead.&lt;ref name="Broom Liner notes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lawrence |first=Kristen |section=Hallowe'en Carols – Music for the Autumnal Season |year=2009 |title=A Broom With A View |type=CD Booklet |location=Santa Ana |publisher=Vörswell Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The song "Soul Cake" from British rock musician [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]'s 2009 album ''[[If on a Winter's Night...]]'' seems to be an adaptation of the Peter, Paul, and Mary version, in that both depart from historical accuracy by referring to Christmas rather than All Saints' Day or All Souls' Day. But the 1893 version of the song already shares lines from similar Christmas carols: "Here We Come A-Wassailing" and "Christmas is A-Coming".&lt;ref name="Keyes"/&gt;

===Philippines and Portugal===
In the Philippines, the practice of souling is called [[Pangangaluwa]] and is practiced on All Hallow's Eve among children in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Fieldhouse2017"/&gt; People drape themselves in white cloths to represent souls and then visit houses, where they sing in return for prayers and sweets.&lt;ref name="Fieldhouse2017"/&gt; 

In Portugal, groups of children go souling on All Hallow's Day, collecting ''[[Pão-por-Deus]]'' (bread for God's sake) from their neighbours.&lt;ref name="MuirWood"&gt;{{cite book|author= Robert Muir-Wood|title=The Cure for Catastrophe|date=17 April 2017|publisher=Oneworld Publications|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Speak White''''' is a racist insult used by English-speaking Canadians against those who speak other languages in public, especially French Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/38/1/parlbus/chambus/senate/deb-e/029db_2005-02-01-E.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=38&amp;Ses=1 Debates - Issue 29 - February 1, 2005, SENATORS' STATEMENTS]&lt;/ref&gt; The slur inspired a French language [[poem]] composed by [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] writer [[Michèle Lalonde]] in 1968. It was first recited in 1970 during the landmark ''Nuit de la Poésie'' and was published in 1974 by Éditions de l'Hexagone, [[Montreal]].  It denounced the poor situation of [[francophone|French-speakers]] in [[Quebec]] and takes the tone of a collective complaint against [[English-speaking Quebecer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

The poem "Speak White" is an integral part of a one-man play  by Robert Lepage  "887" which premiered in Toronto in 2015, and was also performed in August 2015 at the Edinburgh International Arts Festival in Scotland.

{{refimprove||date=November 2013}}

A '''story generator''' or '''plot generator''' is a tool that generates basic [[narratives]] or [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] ideas. The generator could be in the form of a computer program, a chart with multiple columns, a book composed of panels that flip independently of one another, or a set of several adjacent reels that spin independently of one another, allowing a user to select elements of a [[narrative]] plot. The tool may allow the user to select elements for the narrative, or it may combine them randomly, a specific variation known as a '''random plot generator'''. Such tools can be created for virtually any [[genre]], although they tend to produce formulaic and hackneyed situations.

== History ==
Plot generators were described as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Derek |last=Rowntree |title=Do You Really Need a Home Computer? |publisher=Scribner |year=1985 |isbn=0-684-18182-7 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article originally published in 1935 and reprinted in 2002, [[Robert J. Hogan (author)|Robert J. Hogan]] described a book-based device called the ''Plot Genie'' which consisted of three lists of 180 items each: murder victims in the first list, crime locations in the second list, and important clues in the third list. The item to use from each list was chosen by spinning a dial with 180 numbers on it. Hogan also mentions other similar devices called ''The 36 Dramatic Situations'' and ''Plotto: The Master Book of All Plots''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inside an Author's Brain: The Birth of a Book Length Mystery Novelette |first=Robert J.|last=Hogan |journal=[[Writer's Digest]] |date=October 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pulp Masters |first=James |last=van Hise |year=2002| pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Plotto'' by William Wallace Cook is a non-random plot generator. The reader makes all the decisions within the framework set out by the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/plottonewmethodo00cook|title=Plotto|last=Cook|first=William Wallace|date=1928|publisher=Ellis Publishing Company|year=|isbn=|location=Battle Creek, MI|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eger, Markus, Colin M. Potts, Camille Barot, and R. Michael Young. 2015. “[http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AIIDE/AIIDE15/paper/download/11602/11402 Plotter: Operationalizing the Master Book of All Plots].” In ''Eleventh Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment Conference'', 30–33. Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest computerized story generator was TALE-SPIN, an [[artificial intelligence]] program developed in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Selmer |last1=Bringsjord |first2=David A. |last2=Ferrucci |title=Artificial Intelligence and Literary Creativity: Inside the Mind of BRUTUS, a Storytelling Machine |location=Mahwah, New Jersey |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=2000 |isbn=0-8058-1986-X |pages=122, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=TALE-SPIN |first=James |last=Meehan |editor1-first=Roger C. |editor1-last=Schank |editor2-first=Christopher K. |editor2-last=Riesbeck |title=Inside Computer Understanding: Five Programs Plus Miniatures |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1981 |isbn=0-89859-071-X |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently in the 1990s, the computer program MEXICA was developed for academic research into automated plot generation. It produces plots related to the [[Mexica]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rafael |last=Pérez y Pérez |title=Computational Creativity Research: Towards Creative Machines |chapter=From MEXICA to MEXICA-Impro: The Evolution of a Computer Model for Plot Generation |editor1-first=Tarek Richard |editor1-last=Besold |editor2-first=Marco |editor2-last=Schorlemmer |editor3-first=Alan |editor3-last=Smaill |publisher=Atlantis Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-94-6239-084-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using an approach similar to that of MEXICA, the program ProtoPropp generates stories related to [[Russian folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://tomcat-stable.hcmc.uvic.ca:8080/ach/site/xhtml.xq?id=105 |title=Story Generators: Models and Approaches for the Generation of Literary Artefacts |first1=Birte |last1=Lönneker |first2=Jan Christoph |last2=Meister |first3=Pablo |last3=Gervás |first4=Federico |last4=Peinado |first5=Michael |last5=Mateas |conference=Joint Conference of the Association for Computers and the Humanities/Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing |conference-url=http://tomcat-stable.hcmc.uvic.ca:8080/ach/site/index.htm |date=June 2005 |location=[[University of Victoria]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a large number of "random plot generators" available on the internet—generic and relating to specific [[fandom]]s, with a certain amount of academic research into the subject.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Plot generators have also been portrayed in fiction, as in [[Fritz Leiber]]'s ''The Silver Egghead''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Story Generator Algorithm ==
The term story generator algorithms (SGAs) refers to computational procedures resulting in an artifact that can be considered a story. In the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the automated generation of stories has been a subject of research for over fifty years. An algorithm is understood as a set of instructions that, when applied to a given input, produces an output. In the present context, the desired output is a story. The underlying concept of “story” in SGAs is functional and does not imply any aesthetic notion. This is important because it sets the context for evaluation of generated stories, for which having a surface realization as a readable and appealing text is not necessarily a core issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gervás|first1=Pablo|title=Story Generator Algorithms|url=http://wikis.sub.uni-hamburg.de/lhn/index.php/Story_Generator_Algorithms|website=The living book of narratology|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Tales of Berseria'''''|テイルズ オブ ベルセリア|Teiruzu Obu Beruseria|lead=yes}} is a [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] for [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is the sixteenth main entry in the [[Tales (video game series)|''Tales'' series]] and a prequel of ''[[Tales of Zestiria]]''.&lt;ref name="ANNberseria"/&gt; It was released in Japan in August 2016,&lt;ref name="BerDetails"/&gt; and was released worldwide in January 2017.&lt;ref name=ReleaseDate/&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Tales of Berseria gameplay.jpg|left|thumb|230px|A battle sequence from ''Tales of Berseria'', demonstrating the HUD, character skills, and general setup of the ''Liberation Linear Motion Battle System'']]
''Tales of Berseria'' is a [[role-playing video game]], where players navigate the game's world through the game's characters from a third-person perspective.&lt;ref name="TalesBlogA"/&gt; As with previous ''Tales'' games, characters can interact through Skits, animated clips that play outside cutscenes and battle: characters are represented by head-and-shoulder portraits, and conversations can range from serious to comedic. New to the series' Skit systems is a cut-in effect, where at certain moments within skits characters in various poses will appear in response to the dialogue.&lt;ref name="TalesBlogB"/&gt;

As with previous ''Tales'' titles, the game uses a variation of the [[Tales (video game series)|Linear Motion Battle System]] (LMBS). ''Berseria''{{'}}s version is dubbed the "Liberation-LMBS": when in the battle zone, players can freely move around the arena and rotate the camera at will. Characters fight using physical and magical attacks, along with performing skills known as Artes that have various effects on enemies such as stunning them or causing status ailments. Artes can be directly mapped to different control buttons. Abilities outside attacking include guarding against attacks, side-stepping around opponents, and escaping from battle.&lt;ref name="TalesBlogA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="InsideTales"/&gt;

A key element in battles is the Soul Gauge, which replaces the move-governing mechanics of earlier ''Tales'' games: each character has a separate gauge showing up to five Souls, which are used up when Artes are used. While characters can still attack with a depleted Soul Gauge, their attacks can be easily deflected by enemies, but the Soul Gauge automatically recharges with time. Souls are dropped by enemies in battle that can be "stolen" to refill the gauge, a mechanic that enemies can also use to steal Souls from the player.&lt;ref name="TalesBlogA"/&gt; If enough of the Soul Gauge is full characters can activate unique states called the Break Soul, where they can exceed their combo limit and bring unique effects into battle: for instance, Velvet's Break Soul triggers her arm to become bestial and different elemental attacks are triggered depending on enemy type.&lt;ref name="TalesBreak"/&gt;

The main party consists of four characters, which can all be assigned as the controlled character during battle, with the other available playable characters held in reserve.&lt;ref name="TalesBreak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TalesBlogC"/&gt; While primarily designed for [[Single-player video game|single-player]], local [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] for battles is supported.&lt;ref name="IGNrev"/&gt; A mechanic called the Switch Blast can be used when changing characters: by consuming a portion of the Blast Gauge, the controlled party member switches out for a reserve member, who delivers a free attack. The Blast Gauge is also depleted by performing power attacks called Mystic Artes.&lt;ref name="TalesBlogC"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
''Berseria'' takes places in the Holy Midgand Empire, a powerful country that rules over this world's archipelago of a continent. The game's world is shared with ''[[Tales of Zestiria]]'', although the events occur before the latter. There are countless numbers of islands around, and Midgand's rule crosses even the seas. Areas of land and islands in the game are divided into "territories."&lt;ref name="BerDetails"/&gt; Along with humans, one of the other main races is the Malakhim (singular: Malak), supernatural spirits whose wills are sealed and used by humans as slaves to utilize their magical abilities after being made visible to even normal humans due to the Advent, an incident 3 years prior to Velvet's escape from her prison. Throughout the empire, a disease known as Daemonblight causes those infected to lose their humanity and sense of rationality and transform into monsters known as Daemons, who pose a threat to the world. Along with the rulers of the Holy Midgand Empire exists a theocratic order known as the Abbey, who are of great political and religious importance and are influential in imperial affairs. The Exorcists, soldiers from the Abbey, are tasked with bringing peace and order by purging the world of Daemons and are willing to go to extremes to reach their goal.

===Story===
When she was a child, Velvet Crowe and her younger brother Laphicet were saved by her brother-in-law Artorius when a Scarlet Night happened and daemons attacked their village; Velvet's pregnant older sister Celica was killed during the event known as the "Opening". Seven years later, Velvet takes care of her sickly brother with Artorius. The Scarlet Night returns, with the entire village succumbing to the Daemonblight: when Velvet finds Artorius, she sees him sacrifice her brother as part of a ritual, known as the "Advent". Artorius attempts to use her for the Advent as well, but she fights back and the Daemonblight possesses her arm, mutating it and turning her into a Daemon called a "Therion", with the ability to absorb Daemons. In a rage, she slaughters the nearby Daemons before passing out. She awakes in a prison for Daemons on the island Titania, swearing to kill Artorius and avenge her brother's murder. A group of beings known as Malakhim, who were previously only visible to "resonant" individuals, become visible to most people of the world after the "Advent". Over the next three years, Artorius forms the Abbey to bring peace to the Holy Midgand Empire, becoming the Abbey's "Shepherd" and is seen as a savior by the people for establishing the Exorcists using the malakhim.  

After three years in prison, Velvet is freed by Seres, Artorius' former malak, who has broken away from him. During her escape, Velvet aids fellow prisoners Rokurou and Magilou and fights against the Praetor Exorcist Oscar Dragonia.  Seres takes a fatal attack when Oscar turns one of his Malakhim servants into a dragon to face them. Absorbing Seres at her own request, Velvet makes a final attack on Oscar that blinds him in one eye before he escapes.  Velvet realizes at this point that Seres must be a reincarnation of her deceased sister, Celica. Velvet and company then escape the island. Over the course of her journey to get her revenge, she also meets Laphicet, a Malak formerly in service to Praetor Exorcist Teresa Linares until being kidnapped and named by her; Eleanor, an Abbey Exorcist who questions their methods; and Eizen, a Malak who travels with pirates who grant the group sanctuary. They are also joined by Bienfu, a Normin Malak originally contracted with Magilou and who had since been bound to Eleanor while Magilou was imprisoned. Eleanor is initially reluctant to join Velvet, attempting suicide before being asked to spy on the group and then learning the Abbey's full plans.

The group learn that Artorius, Oscar, Teresa, and Legate Exorcists Shigure Rangetsu and Melchior Mayvin are trying to purge the Daemonblight by erasing all emotion from humankind: to do this, they needed to summon Innominat, one of five powerful Malakim called the Empyreans, into the world. The Abbey has been creating Therions and feeding their power to Innominat to awaken him. The Abbey is ultimately successful, with Innominat taking on the form of Velvet's deceased brother. It is also revealed to the group early on that Daemonblight is actually an impurity called "malevolence" generated by the negative emotions of humanity, which can turn humans into Daemons, and that Daemons and Malakhim are visible to only humans who possess "resonance" in them. Artorius' actions caused humanity's latent resonance to be amplified, revealing Malakhim and Daemons. Laphicet is revealed to be the reincarnation of Celica's unborn son. Initially disheartened by the revelations, Velvet embraces her role as the "Lord of Calamity" who will topple the Abbey.

In order for the group to defeat Artorius and Innominat, they pursue each of the Exorcists, defeating them and using their souls as sacrifices to awaken the four Empyreans. They then face Artorius, who merges with Innominat in the final battle before Velvet kills him once and for all. Innominat begins going berserk, and Velvet decides to seal herself away with him so that Laphicet and the other Therions (whose lives are linked to Innominat's) can survive. Laphicet becomes Innominat's replacement with the help of the four Empyreans who would serve Laphicet as his Lords. Laphicet then transforms into a benevolent dragon and purifies the land of malevolence, at the cost of humans not being able to see the Malakhim. Eleanor decides to become a Shepherd to guide the people, Magilou records the events of the world in her role as a scribe, while Laphicet renames himself as "Maotelus"—these events foreshadow and set the scene for ''[[Tales of Zestiria]]''.

:Once addressed by Velvet with the nickname of "Arthur" and her brother-in-law, Artorius is the head of the Abbey and the Exorcists who is deemed the world's savior and the game's primary antagonist for having acquired a power that would allow him to save the world from the Daemonblight. He favors the use of reason over emotion as part of his battle tactics, and has used this as the prime teaching for all Exorcists. The true reason over his action is his desire to be reunited with Celica again, as her reincarnation into a Malak and losing her emotion and memories over her time with Artorius drive him insane.

==Development==
Development for ''Tales of Berseria'' began in the fall of 2014 at Bandai Namco Studios, after active development had finished on ''Zestiria''. A notable change was Hideo Baba not acting as producer, his role instead being filled by Yasuhiro Fukaya while Baba himself took over general supervision of the ''Tales'' series.&lt;ref name="FukayaInterview"/&gt; Yoshimasa Tanaka acted as director; the music was composed by [[Motoi Sakuraba]]; the battle system was designed by Tatsuro Udo; while the characters were designed by [[Mutsumi Inomata]], [[Kōsuke Fujishima]], Minoru Iwamoto and Daigo Okumura.&lt;ref name="JPstaff"/&gt; While it is the first original ''Tales'' title to be developed for the [[PlayStation 4]], it will also release on the [[PlayStation 3]] in Japan: the game was first developed on PS3, then upgraded to PS4. Using a similar engine to past ''Tales'' titles, the majority of updating went into technical improvements to ensure smooth performance on all platforms.&lt;ref name="FukayaInterview"/&gt; ''Berseria'' is intended to be the last mainline ''Tales'' title for seventh-generation consoles.&lt;ref name="WiredInterview"/&gt;

The scenario was written by Naoki Yamamoto, who had previously worked on ''Zestiria''.&lt;ref name="TOBfanInterview"/&gt; Despite being a distant prequel to ''Tales of Zestiria''—taking place in the distant past and containing references—the game's story was designed to be able to work on its own. This distant connection concept was inspired by the developer's wish to emulate the similar distant narrative connection between ''[[Tales of Phantasia]]'' and ''[[Tales of Symphonia]]''.&lt;ref name="FukayaInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WiredInterview"/&gt; It also featured nods to earlier entries in the series, such as the party's ship being named after a similar transport ship in ''[[Tales of Eternia]]''.&lt;ref name="Sil2017"/&gt; The main theme of ''Tales of Berseria'' is the conflict between emotion and reason, with Velvet being the incarnation of emotion and rage.&lt;ref name="BerDetails"/&gt; This theme is represented in the game's title, which stems from the term "[[Berserker]]", legendary warriors who were imbued with uncontrollable power.&lt;ref name="Sil2017"/&gt; The game was the first in the ''Tales'' series to feature a sole female protagonist, with the previous leading female character being Milla Maxwell from ''[[Tales of Xillia]]'', who shared her role as a main dual protagonist with male protagonist character Jude Mathis. As Milla had been popular with the ''Tales'' fanbase, it was decided that ''Berseria'' would have a female lead. The decision was also influenced by the growing demands for female lead characters in gaming, particularly from the West.&lt;ref name="WiredInterview"/&gt;

Bandai Namco Entertainment had filed a trademark for the title, along with two other titles, on April 20, 2015.&lt;ref name="BersTrademark"/&gt; On June 6, 2015, the game was officially announced, including details on the protagonist Velvet, voiced by [[Rina Satou]] and designed by Mutsumi Inomata. It was revealed that [[ufotable]] would animate the anime cutscenes.&lt;ref name="ANNberseria"/&gt; The game was described as the final part of the company's 20th anniversary celebrations for the ''Tales'' series.&lt;ref name="20thFinal"/&gt; The game's year of release was announced in December 2015, while its western release for PS4 and Microsoft Windows was confirmed the following week.&lt;ref name="BerDetails"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BerWest"/&gt; The game's theme song, "Burn", was composed and performed by [[Flow (band)|Flow]].&lt;ref name="BersFlow"/&gt; Its [[Tales (video game series)|characteristic genre name]], a recurring feature of the series, is {{nihongo3|lit. "RPG of Discovering your Own Reason to Live"|君が君らしく生きるためのRPG|Kimi ga kimirashiku ikiru tame no ārupījī}}.&lt;ref name="BerCGN"/&gt; For the game's Western release, the scene where Artorius kills Velvet's brother Laphicet was altered: rather than stabbing him directly with his sword, Artorius sacrifices him through a magical ceremony, reducing the level of violence while keeping the dramatic significance of the scene intact. This alteration was made to keep the game's age rating within acceptable levels, with particular reference being given to preserving the "16" rating given by Europe's [[Pan European Game Information]] board. In a later statement Bandai Namco stated that, aside from text and dialogue variations standard for the game's Japanese-to-English localization, no other content had been altered for the Western release.&lt;ref name="BerseriaAlteration"/&gt;

The game received a positive reception overall. Aggregate site [[Metacritic]] gave the PS4 and PC versions of the game scores of 79/100 and 80/100 respectively.&lt;ref name="metaPS4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metaPC"/&gt; ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave ''Tales of Berseria'' a score of 35 out of 40 based on four reviews. Among the positive comments made were towards its story and characters, along with aspects of its gameplay. The reviewers' main criticisms were leveled against some lack of originality in the gameplay and disappointment that the game did not better utilize the graphical power of the PS4.&lt;ref name="FamReview"/&gt; ''[[Dengeki PlayStation]]'' praised the story and characters, particularly noting Satō's performance as Velvet, and said the battles were the most enjoyable in the series to date. It did criticize the tutorials as being too long, wanted faster character movement earlier in the game, and said that series newcomers might be overwhelmed by the number of aspects to learn.&lt;ref name="DengReview"/&gt;

Meghan Sullivan from ''[[IGN]]'' gave ''Tales of Berseria'' a score of 8.8/10, praising the emotional storytelling, diverse cast of characters, and how Velvet felt more like an [[anti-hero]] compared to protagonists of prior entries of the ''Tales'' series.&lt;ref name="IGNrev"/&gt; Some criticisms were about the generic look of some of the game's environment and how much backtracking was required through old locations to advance through the game.&lt;ref name="IGNrev"/&gt;

''[[Destructoid]]'' gave it a score of 8/10.&lt;ref name="destruct"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-tales-of-berseria-415695.phtml |title=Review: Tales of Berseria |publisher=Destructoid |date= |accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5437">'''Terministic screen''' is a term in the theory and criticism of [[rhetoric]]. It involves the acknowledgment of a language system that determines an individual's perception and symbolic action in the world.

==Overview==
[[Kenneth Burke]] develops the terministic screen in his book of essays called ''[[Language as Symbolic Action]]'' in 1966. He defines the concept as "a screen composed of terms through which humans perceive the world, and that direct attention away from some interpretations and toward others".&lt;ref&gt;Stob, Paul. " 'Terministic Screens', Social Constructionism, and the Language of Experience: Kenneth Burke's Utilization of William James". Philosophy and Rhetoric 42, no. 2 (May 1, 2008): 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke offers the metaphor to explain why people interpret messages differently, based on the construction of symbols, meanings, and, therefore, reality.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "Terministic Screens". In Language as Symbolic Action, 45. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Words convey a particular meaning, conjuring images and ideas that induce support toward beliefs or opinions. Receivers interpret the intended message through a metaphorical screen of their own vocabulary and perspective to the world.&lt;ref&gt;Blakesley, David, ed. The Terministic Screen: Rhetorical Perspectives on Film. Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain terms may grab attention and lead to a particular conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Palczewski, Catherine Helen, Richard Ice, and John Fritch. "Terministic Screen." In Rhetoric in Civic Life, 39. State College, PA: Strata Publishing, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; "Language reflects, selects, and deflects as a way of shaping the symbol systems that allow us to cope with the world".{{sfn|Stob|p=139}} Every word chosen says something about the society we live in. The language we choose to use will be a representation of our reality, our world, our culture, and our beliefs, even without intention.

== Scientistic versus dramatistic ==
Burke describes two different types of terministic screens: scientistic and dramatistic. Scientistic begins with a definition of a term; it describes the term as what it is or what it is not, putting the term in black and white. When defining, the essential function is either attitudinal or hortatory. In other words, the focus is on expressions or commands. When terms are treated as hortatory, they are developed. Burke comments on why he uses developed rather than another word. "I say 'developed'; I do not say 'originating'. The ultimate origins of language seem to me as mysterious as the origins of the universe itself. One must view it, I feel, simply as the 'given' ". {{sfn|Burke|p=44}} The dramatistic approach concerns action: thou shalt or thou shalt not.{{sfn|Burke|p=45}} This screen directs the audience toward action based on interpretation of a term. Via terministic screens, the audience will be able to associate with the term or dissociate from it.{{sfn|Burke|p=49}}

== Social constructionism ==
"[[Social constructionism]] is a metaphor that attempts to capture the way Burke viewed the nature of the world and the function of language therein." Symbols, terms, and language build our view of life. Social constructionism allows us to look at Burke's theory in terms we recognize and are comfortable with. {{sfn|Stob|p=131}}

== Examples ==
When a person says gender, most people, based on their individual beliefs, normally think of male or female. However, some could think of intersex individuals. If someone says they think of male, female, and intersex, more would be reflected about the person based on their terminology. Still others would recognize gender as different from biological sex, and say they think of man, woman, and other genders. Another example occurs within the abortion controversy. A pro-choice advocate would most likely use the word "fetus" but pro-life advocates would use the word "baby", because the term stirs more realistic and relatable images and has a bearing on the legal status. Using the word "baby" versus "fetus" defines reality differently (scientistic) and guides people to act in a certain way (dramatistic) solely based on term selection that may be unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Ian. " 'The Human Barnyard' and Kenneth Burke's Philosophy of Technology". KB Journal 5, no. 2 (Spring 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==
Words are absolute for thought and action.{{sfn|Palczewski, Ice, and Fritch|p=39}} According to Burke, individuals create terministic screens consciously and unconsciously, as they perceive the world and share perspectives.  Burke contends these screens set up a network of beliefs through which all ideas will be interpreted. Communication scholar Paul Stob contends that the language we use is thus not just a direct reflection of our intelligence, but also of perception and culture.  David Blakesley posits that the terministic screen enables the further understanding of rhetorical perspectives. In each of these ways, the terministic screen allows for concepts to be interpreted in different ways by different people and contribute to the complexity of meaning.

There are two pseudo-Chaucerian texts called '''''The Plowman's Tale (aka Brent's Story)'''''. 

In the mid-15th century a [[rhyme royal]] ''Plowman's Tale'' was added to the text of ''The Canterbury Tales'' in the Christ Church MS. This tale is actually an orthodox [[Roman Catholic]], possibly anti-[[Lollard]] version of a [[Virgin Mary|Marian]] miracle story written by [[Thomas Hoccleve]] called ''Item de Beata Virgine''. Someone composed and added a prologue to fit Hoccleve's poem into [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s narrative frame. This bogus tale did not survive into the printed editions of Chaucer's ''Works''.

The better-known ''Plowman's Tale'' was included in printed editions of Chaucer's ''Works''. It is a decidedly [[John Wycliffe|Wycliffite]] anti-fraternal tale that was written ''ca.'' 1400 and circulated among the Lollards. Sometimes titled ''The Complaynte of the Plowman'', it is 1380 lines long, composed of eight-line stanzas (ababbcbc with some variations suggesting interpolation) like Chaucer's ''[[Monk's Tale]]''. There is no clear internal/design connection in ''The Plowman's Tale'' with Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' or ''[[Piers Plowman]]''. [[Anthony Wotton]], who was probably the editor of the 1606 edition of ''The Plowman's Tale'', suggested that ''The Plowman's Tale'' makes a reference to ''[[Jack Upland]]'' or, more likely, ''[[Pierce the Ploughman's Crede]]'', since main character in ''The Plowman's Tale'' says, "Of Freres I haue told before / In a making of a Crede..." (1065–66). ''The Plowman's Tale'' also borrows heavily from the ''Crede''.

Some sections of ''The Plowman's Tale'', such as the prologue, were added in the 16th century to make it fit better as one of Chaucer's tales. The prologue announces that a sermon is to follow in the tale. Instead, a traveller with none of the characteristics of Chaucer's plowman (or any literary plowman of the era) overhears a Pelican and a [[Griffin]] debating about the clergy. Most of the lines are the Pelican's, who attacks the typical offences in an evangelical manner, discusses Antichrist, and appeals to the secular government to humble the church. The Pelican is driven off by force but is then vindicated by a Phoenix. The tale ends with a disclaimer wherein the author distinguishes his own views from those of the Pelican, stating that he will accept what the church requires.

The association of this and other texts with Chaucer was possible because Chaucer's ''[[General Prologue]]'' to ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' introduces a Plowman who never receives a tale. This omission seems to have sparked the creativity of others from an early date. In the ''General Prologue'', the Host jokes about the Plowman's brother, who is the Parson. In [https://web.archive.org/web/20050220092306/http://www.lib.rochester.edu/CAMELOT/TEAMS/chauplow.htm some surviving manuscripts] the Host suggests that the Parson is a "Lollere." As early as 1400, Chaucer's courtly audience grew to include members of the rising literate, middle-/merchant class, which included many Lollard sympathizers who would have been inclined to believe in a Lollard Chaucer.

==Printed Editions and their interpretation==
The sole surviving manuscript of ''The Plowman's Tale'' (written in a sixteenth-century hand) was inserted at the end of ''The Canterbury Tales'' in a copy of [[Thomas Godfray (printer)|Thomas Godfrey/Godfray]]'s 1532 printed edition of Chaucer's ''Works'' (STC 5068), edited by [[William Thynne]]. (This is in PR 1850 1532 cop. 1 at the University of Texas Harry Ransom Center.) According to [[Thomas Speght]], [[John Stow]] had a manuscript copy that is now lost. William Thynne's son, [[Francis Thynne]], wrote in his ''Animadversions'' that ''The Plowman's Tale'' was not printed along with the other tales in 1532 because of suppression started by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Thomas Wolsey]] (ca. 1475-1529/30). However, Francis Thynne's views are often discounted, largely because he was only an infant when his father was working on his Chaucer editions.

Some scholars have argued that ''The Plowman's Tale'' was part of a Henrician propaganda effort. Godfrey was probably working with the King's Printer, [[Thomas Berthelet]], and he was protected by [[Thomas Cromwell]] (c. 1485–1540), earl of Essex, who was responsible for the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] (1536–39). But ''The Plowman's Tale'' could also be used as criticism against the king, since the Pelican marvels at the ignorance of parliament and of the lords and the king concerning the plight of the commons. In the mildest interpretation, ''The Plowman's Tale'' makes a bid for the necessity and appropriateness of heeding the concerns of the commons.

''The Plowman's Tale'' was successfully printed on its own in an octavo edition by Godfray ca. 1533–36 (STC 5099.5). In 1542, [[William Tyndale|Tyndale]]'s [[New Testament]] and other vernacular books were banned – essentially everything printed in English before 1540 – with the exception of "Canterburye tales, Chaucers bokes, Gowers bokes and stories of mennes lieves" according to a royal statute, the ''Act for the Advancement of True Religion''. ''The Plowman's Tale'' was printed again as a duodecimo volume in London by William Hyll ca. 1548 (STC 5100) as "The Plouumans tale compylled by syr Geffray Chaucher knyght." In the year of the ban it was printed in Thynne's second (1542) edition of Chaucer's ''Works'', under the imprints of William Bonham (STC 5069) and John Reynes (STC 5070).

After 1542, ''The Plowman's Tale'' appeared in new and reprinted editions of Chaucer's ''Works'' based on Thynne's text for some two centuries, during which the Chaucer canon and order of the ''Canterbury Tales'' was quite fluid. [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] finally excluded ''The Plowman's Tale'' from his 1775 edition of the poet's work.

==Associated with Chaucer and Piers Plowman from 1500–1700==
The king's [[antiquary]] (under Henry VIII), [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] (c. 1506–52), seems to have confused ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' and ''The Plowman's Tale'', referring to ''Petri Aratoris Fabula'' (Peter/Piers Plowman's Tale) as a Canterbury tale. [[John Bale]] similarly included ''Arator Narratio'' (Plowman's Tale) in his list of the ''Canterbury Tales'' in his ''Scriptorum Illustrium Maioris Brytanniae . . . Catalogus'' (Basle, 1557, 1559). Corroborating Francis Thynne, Leland's remarks on ''The Plowman's Tale'' are as follows: "But the tale of Piers Plowman, which by the common consent of the learned is attributed to Chaucer as its true author, has been suppressed in each edition, because it vigorously inveighed against the bad morals of the priests" (''Commentarii de Scriptoribus Britannicis'' ed. [[Anthony Hall (antiquarian)|Anthony Hall]]. Like Bale's Chaucer, Leland's Chaucer is a reformer and follower of Wycliffe.

[[John Foxe]] praised ''The Plowman's Tale'' in his first (1563) and second (1570) editions of the immensely influential ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Acts and Monuments]]''. Foxe implies that Chaucer was a [[proto-Protestantism|proto-Protestant]] Lollard and assumes he was the author of ''The Plowman's Tale''. (''[[The Testament of Love]]'' and ''[[Jack Upland]]'' are also mentioned.) ''The Plowman's Tale'' was again printed by itself in 1606 by Anthony Wotton. The full title of Wotton's edition reads: "The Plough-mans Tale. Shewing by the doctrine and liues of the Romish Clergie, that the pope is AntiChrist and they his Ministers. Written by Sir Geffrey Chaucer, Knight, amongst his Canterburie tales: and now set out apart from the rest, with a short exposition of the words and matters, for the capacitie and understanding of the simpler sort of Readers."

[[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Shepheardes Calender]]'' (1579) makes references to and borrows from ''The Plowman's Tale'' (attributing it to Chaucer), possibly ''[[Pierce the Plowman's Crede]]'', and, more obscurely, perhaps to ''Piers Plowman''. [[Gabriel Harvey]]'s copy of the Speght 1598 edition of Chaucer's ''Works'' (BL Additional 42518) summarises ''The Plowman's Tale'' with the note "Ecclesiastical abuses."

[[William Vaughan (writer)|Sir William Vaughan]]'s ''Golden Fleece'' (1626) presents Chaucer as Wycliffe's master and the author of ''The Plowman's Tale'', which is used to give lines to [[Duns Scotus]] and Chaucer in a debate between them that centres on the Pope (Is he Antichrist?) just as in the 1606 Wotton edition. This work promotes the colony at Newfoundland over against the vices of contemporary England. Famous historical figures, including Chaucer and Scotus, are brought to the court of Apollo to discuss English society. Apollo ultimately proclaims that all the problems that are exposed will be cured by the Golden Fleece, which is in Newfoundland.

Other seventeenth-century citations of ''The Plowman's Tale'' are: Anthony Wotton's ''A Defense of Mr. Perkins Booke, Called a Reformed Catholike'' (1606), [[Simon Birkbeck]]'s ''The Protestant's Evidence Taken Ovt of Good Records'' (1635), ''John Favour's Antiquitie Trivmphing Over Noveltie'' (1619), and [[John Milton]]'s ''Of Reformation'' (1641) and ''An Apology Against a Pamphlet'' (1642).

[[John Dryden]] remarks in ''Fables Ancient and Modern'' (1700) that Chaucer had "some little Byas toward the Opinions of Wycliff . . . somewhat of which appears in the Tale of Piers Plowman [an interesting conflation of Langland and pseudo-Chaucer]: Yet I cannot blame him for inveighing so sharply against the Vices of the Clergy of his Age: Their Pride, their Ambition, their Pomp, their Avarice, their Worldly Interest, deserv'd the lashes which he gave them, both in that, and in most of his Canterbury Tales." The phrase "inveighed . . . against the clergy" is possibly derived from Leland; similar synopses appear in the editions of Chaucer's ''Works'' starting with Thynne. Another eighteenth-century commentator, [[John Dart]], rejected ''The Plowman's Tale'' as Chaucer's but still agreed that Chaucer "bitterly inveighs against the Priests and Fryars", although he "expresses his regard for the secular clergy who lived up to their profession".

Austen's death in 1805) and married Austen's brother Frank late in life.&lt;ref&gt;Le Faye. ''Family Record'', 68–69, 74, 111, 149, 178; Honan, 41, 77–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Jane and Cassandra were also friends for many years with three sisters, Alethea, Elizabeth and Catherine Bigg, who lived at Manydown Park.&lt;ref&gt;Le Faye. ''Family Record'', 117; Honan, 85–86, 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Brydges Lefroy, wife of Rev. George Lefroy, "became Jane Austen's best-loved and admired mentor, the person she would always run to for advice and encouragement" after the Lefroys moved to nearby Ashe in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Her death in a riding accident in 1804 left Jane grief-stricken.&lt;ref&gt;Honan, 210-11.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Austen met, danced with, and perhaps fell in love with [[Thomas Langlois Lefroy|Thomas Lefroy]] during the Christmas holidays in 1795. However, Lefroy departed to begin his law studies in January 1796 and he and Jane never saw each other again.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 12–120; Honan, 105–111.&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Blackall, a Fellow of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], and a friend of Mrs. Anne Lefroy, was seriously interested in marrying Austen in 1797.&lt;ref&gt;Honan, 113–114; Tomalin, 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt; Austen family tradition holds that Jane and an unnamed young clergyman fell in love while the Austen family visited the seaside at Sidmouth in the summer of 1801. Cassandra is said to have approved of this young man, but he died unexpectedly several months later, before he and Jane could be together again.&lt;ref&gt;Honan, 185–186; Tomalin, 178. The travel to Sidmouth, but not the relationship, is described in Le Faye. ''Family Record'', 135–136.&lt;/ref&gt; Austen received her only proposal of marriage from Harris Bigg-Wither, brother of her friends Alethea, Elizabeth and Catherine Bigg, while visiting them at their home in December 1802. Austen at first accepted the proposal, then realized she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 178–181; Honan, 189–198.&lt;/ref&gt; Austen biographer [[Park Honan]] suggests that Jane may have received a proposal of marriage from Edward Bridges, a brother of Edward Austen's wife Elizabeth, in 1805, but biographer [[Claire Tomalin]] dismisses this claim.&lt;ref&gt;Honan, 121; Tomalin, 309, note 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane Austen was primarily educated at home by her father and older brothers and through her own reading.&lt;ref&gt;Isobel Grundy, "Jane Austen and Literary Traditions", ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', Eds. Edward Copeland and Juliet McMaster. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1997), {{ISBN|0-521-49867-8}}, 190–91; Tomalin, 28–29, 33–43, 66–67; Honan, 31–34; Lascelles, 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Her apprenticeship as a writer lasted from her teenage years until she was about thirty-five years old. During this period, she wrote three major novels and began a fourth.&lt;ref&gt;These included the original versions of and revisions to the novels later published as ''Sense and Sensibility'', ''Pride and Prejudice'' and ''Northanger Abbey'', and a novel fragment, ''The Watsons''.  Kathryn Sutherland, "Chronology of Composition and Publication", ''Jane Austen in Context'', Ed. Janet Todd. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (2005),  {{ISBN|0-521-82644-6}}, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1811 until 1815, with the release of ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1811), ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813), ''[[Mansfield Park (novel)|Mansfield Park]]'' (1814), and ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' (originally written in 1798–1799 and revised later) and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'', both published after her death in 1817, and began a third (eventually titled ''[[Sanditon]]''), but died before it could be completed. A product of 18th-century literary traditions, Austen's works were influenced most by those of renowned writer and critic [[Samuel Johnson]] and novelists [[Frances Burney]] and [[Maria Edgeworth]]. She considered poet and novelist Sir [[Walter Scott]] a rival. Family theatricals, which included plays by [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] and other 18th-century dramatists, shaped Austen's writing from an early age.&lt;ref&gt;George Holbert Tucker, "Amateur Theatricals at Steventon", ''The Jane Austen Companion'', Ed.

Austen's engagement with [[sensibility]] illustrates her debt to sentimental writers such as [[Laurence Sterne]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Stabler, "Literary influences", ''Jane Austen in Context''. Ed.

Austen published all of her novels in the [[English Regency|Regency]] period, during which King [[George III]] was declared permanently insane and his son was appointed as [[Prince Regent]], and the novels are firmly rooted in the [[Georgian society in Jane Austen's novels|social context]] of the time. Throughout most of Austen's adult life, Britain was at war with [[French revolution|revolutionary France]]. Fearing the spread of revolution and violence to Britain, the government tried to repress political [[Radicalism (historical)|radicals]] by suspending ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and passing the [[Seditious Meetings Act 1795|Seditious Meetings Act]] and the [[Treasonable Practices Act]], known as the "Gagging Acts". Many reformers still held out hope for change in Britain during the 1790s, but by the first two decades of the 19th century, the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] had exhausted the country and a deep conservative reaction had set in. While Austen's novels rarely explicitly touch on these events, she herself was personally affected by them, as two of her brothers served in the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet Todd, ''The Cambridge Introduction to Jane Austen''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (2006),  {{ISBN|978-0-521-67469-0}}, 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Napoleon]] was finally defeated at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815, Britain rejoiced. However, economic hardships in the 1810s increased the income disparity in the country and class conflict rose as the [[Industrial Revolution]] began.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tombstone tourist''' (otherwise known as a "cemetery enthusiast", "cemetery tourist", "grave hunter", "graver", or "taphophile") describes an individual who has a passion for and enjoyment of [[cemetery|cemeteries]], [[epitaph]]s, [[Stone rubbing|gravestone rubbing]], photography, art, and history of (famous) deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rogak, Lisa |date=2004|title=Stones and Bones of New England: A guide to unusual, historic, and otherwise notable cemeteries|publisher= Globe Pequat |isbn= 0-7627-3000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been most notably used by author and biographer Scott Stanton as the title of his former website and book, ''The Tombstone Tourist: Musicians'' (2003), about the lives and gravesites of famous musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tombstone Tourist: Musicians|authors=Stanton, Scott &amp; Stanton, Robin W. |isbn= 9780965996693|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cemetery tourists are particularly interested in the historical aspects of cemeteries or the historical relevance of their inhabitants. [[La Recoleta Cemetery]] in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina and [[Zentralfriedhof]] (Central Cemetery) in [[Vienna, Austria]] carry a large array of famous inhabitants and their tombs, that make the cemeteries significant tourist destinations.

[[Genealogy tourism|Genealogy tourists]] make considerable effort to search out cemeteries and their records, to verify grave records and ancestral burial locations.

==History==
For centuries, people have made [[pilgrimages]] to the burial sites of religious icons and leaders.  In fact, such was common during medieval times when people went to gravesites or to shrines to venerate saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/NORpilgrimage.htm|title=Pilgrimage|author=Simkin, John|website=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the ancient tradition of [[Ancestor Worship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/a/ancestor_worship.html|title=Ancestor Worship|website=Themystica.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; also involved a veneration of dead relatives with visitations to shrines and gravesites.

During the 19th century, garden cemeteries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timetravel-britain.com/05/April/cemeteries.shtml|title=London's Victorian Garden Cemeteries|website=Timetravel-britain.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to appear that encouraged visitors to stay and visit in the cemetery. Famous among these is the [[Père Lachaise cemetery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pere-lachaise.com/perelachaise.php?lang=en|title=Cimetière du Père Lachaise -Visite virtuelle - Cemetery's virtual tour - Jim Morrison - Edith Piaf|website=Pere-lachaise.com|accessdate=4 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230091818/http://www.pere-lachaise.com/perelachaise.php?lang=en|archivedate=30 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Paris, France]], which continues to invite tourists to visit and see elaborate memorials not only to the world famous, but to lesser known individuals as well.

Cemetery records have also been a way of verifying genealogical data. Making gravestone rubbings was in practice for centuries as a way of providing this documentation and appreciating the carvings on the tombstones. Among genealogists, scouring cemeteries looking for the graves of dead ancestors is a common and longstanding practice with individuals often relying on limited and outdated information to find burial sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alsirat.com/silence/rubbings.html|title=City of the Silent - Tombstone Rubbings|website=Alsirat.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
{{original research|section|date=July 2016}}
The appreciation of cemeteries has evolved along with science and technology.  The Internet allows enthusiasts to visit cemeteries (and in some cases the gravesites of their own ancestors) on websites such as [[Find a Grave]]. There are also many websites and books devoted to people's personal explorations into cemeteries, particularly ones that contain the remains of famous individuals. There are also tour companies that organize and plan tours to famous cemeteries.

The hunting of graves has become digital as many cemetery transcribers and ancestor hunters have begun using [[GPS]] equipment to locate the area where a graveyard or gravesite is reputed to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guerrero|first1=Russell|title=Plotting a Grave Project|url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/public_relations/on_campus/cemetary_project/|website=Trinity University|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40230">'''Traditional stories''', or [[narrative|stories]] about [[tradition]]s, differ from both [[fiction]] and [[nonfiction]] in that the importance of transmitting the story's [[worldview]] is generally understood to transcend an immediate need to establish its categorization as [[imagination|imaginary]] or [[fact]]ual. In the academic circles of literature, religion, history, and anthropology, categories of traditional story are important [[terminology]] to identify and interpret stories more precisely. Some stories belong in multiple categories and some stories do not fit into any category.

==Anecdote==
{{main|Anecdote}}
An ''anecdote'' is a short and amusing or interesting [[narrative|story]] about a [[biographical]] incident. It may be as brief as the setting and provocation of a ''[[List of French phrases#B|bon mot]]''. An anecdote is always presented as based on a real incident involving actual persons, whether famous or not, usually in an identifiable place; whether authentic or not, it has [[verisimilitude]] or [[truthiness]]. Over time, modification in reuse may convert a particular anecdote to a fictional piece, one that is retold but is "too good to be true". Sometimes humorous, anecdotes are not [[joke]]s, because their primary purpose is not simply to evoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, or to delineate an institutional or character trait in such a light that it strikes in a flash of insight to the very essence. [[Novalis]] observed, "An anecdote is a historical element — a historical molecule or epigram."&lt;ref&gt;"Eine Anekdote ist eines historisches Element — ein historisches Molekül oder Epigramm": the quote is the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] to Gossman 20030&lt;/ref&gt; A brief monologue beginning "A man pops in a bar ..." will be a joke. A brief monologue beginning "Once [[J. Edgar Hoover]] popped in a bar ..." will be an anecdote. An anecdote thus is closer to the tradition of the [[parable]] than the patently invented [[fable]] with its animal characters and generic human figures &amp;mdash; but it is distinct from the parable in the historical specificity which it claims.

Anecdotes are often of [[satire|satirical]] nature. Under the [[totalitarianism|totalitarian regime]] in the [[Soviet Union]] numerous political anecdotes circulating in society were the only way to reveal and denounce vices of the political system and its leaders. They made fun of such personalities as [[Lenin]], [[Khrushchev]], [[Brezhnev]], and other Soviet leaders. In contemporary Russia there are many anecdotes about [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://samlib.ru/editors/j/jacko_w_a/anecdotes.shtml Yatsko V. Russian folk funny stories]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word 'anecdote' (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: "unpublished", literally "not given out") comes from [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the biographer of [[Justinian I]], who produced a work entitled {{lang|grc|Ἀνέκδοτα}} (''Anekdota'', variously translated as ''Unpublished Memoirs'' or ''Secret History''), which is primarily a collection of short incidents from the private life of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] court.  Gradually, the term ''anecdote'' came to be applied&lt;ref&gt;Its first appearance in English is of 1676 (''[[OED]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; to any short tale utilized to emphasize or illustrate whatever point the author wished to make.&lt;ref&gt;Note that in the context of [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Russian humor]] ''anecdote'' refers to any short humorous story without the need of factual or biographical origins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apologue==
{{main|Apologue}}
An ''apologue'' or ''apolog'' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀπόλογος, a "statement" or "account") is a brief fable or allegorical story with pointed or exaggerated details, meant to serve as a pleasant vehicle for a moral doctrine or to convey a useful lesson without stating it explicitly. It is like a parable, except that it contains supernatural elements like a fable, often the personification of animals or plants. Unlike a [[fable]], the moral is more important than the narrative details. As with the [[parable]], the apologue is a tool of [[rhetoric]]al [[argument]] used to convince or persuade.

Among the best known ancient and classical examples are that of [[Jotham]] in the [[Book of Judges]] (9:7-15); "The Belly and its Members," by the patrician [[Agrippa Menenius Lanatus (consul 503 BC)|Agrippa Menenius Lanatus]] in the second book of [[Livy]]; and perhaps most famous of all, those of [[Aesop]]. Well-known modern examples of this literary form include [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and the [[Br'er Rabbit]] stories derived from African and Cherokee cultures and recorded and synthesized by [[Joel Chandler Harris]].  The term is applied more particularly to a story in which the actors or speakers are either various kinds of animals or are inanimate objects. An apologue is distinguished from a [[fable]] in that there is always some moral sense present in the former, which there need not be in the latter. An apologue is generally dramatic, and has been defined as "a satire in action."

An apologue differs from a [[parable]] in several respects. A parable is equally an ingenious tale intended to correct manners, but it can be ''true'' in the sense that "when this kind of actual event happens among men, this is what it means and this is how we should think about it", while an apologue, with its introduction of animals and plants, to which it lends ideas, language and emotions, contains only metaphoric truth: "when this kind of situation exists anywhere in the world, here is an interesting truth about it."  The [[parable]] reaches heights to which the apologue cannot aspire, for the points in which animals and nature present analogies to man are principally those of his lower nature (hunger, desire, pain, fear, etc.), and the lessons taught by the apologue seldom therefore reach beyond prudential morality (keep yourself safe, find ease where you can, plan for the future, don't misbehave or you'll eventually be caught and punished), whereas the parable aims at representing the relations between man and existence or higher powers (know your role in the universe, behave well towards all you encounter, kindness and respect are of higher value than cruelty and slander).  It finds its framework in the world of nature as it actually is, and not in any parody of it, and it exhibits real and not fanciful analogies. The apologue seizes on that which humans have in common with other creatures, and the parable on that which we have in common with a greater existence. Still, in spite of the difference of moral level, [[Martin Luther]] thought so highly of apologues as counselors of virtue that he edited and revised Aesop and wrote a characteristic preface to the volume.  The parable is always blunt and devoid of subtlety, and requires no interpretation; the apologue by nature necessitates at least some degree of reflection and thought to achieve understanding, and in this sense it demands more of the listener than the parable does.

The origin of the apologue is extremely ancient and comes from the Middle East and its surrounding area (Persia, Asia Minor, Egypt, etc.), which is the Classical fatherland of everything connected with [[allegory]], [[metaphor]] and [[imagination]]. Veiled truth was often necessary in the Middle East, particularly among the [[slave]]s, who dared not reveal their minds too openly. It is noteworthy that the two fathers of apologue in the West were slaves, namely [[Aesop]] and [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]]. [[La Fontaine]] in France; [[John Gay|Gay]] and [[Robert Dodsley|Dodsley]] in England; [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert|Gellert]], [[Lessing]] and [[Friedrich von Hagedorn|Hagedorn]] in Germany; [[Tomás de Iriarte y Oropesa|Tomas de Iriarte]] in Spain, and [[Ivan Krylov|Krylov]] in Russia, are leading modern writers of apologues.

Length is not an essential matter in the definition of an apologue. Those of La Fontaine are often very short, as, for example, "Le Coq et la Perle" ("The Cock and the Pearl"). On the other hand, in the romances of Reynard the Fox we have medieval apologues arranged in cycles, and attaining epical dimensions. An Italian fabulist, [[Corti]], is said to have developed an apologue of "The Talking Animals" reaching twenty-six [[canto]]s.

[[Antoine Houdar de la Motte|La Motte]], writing at a time when this species of literature was universally admired, attributes its popularity to the fact that it manages and flatters [[amour-propre]] by inculcating virtue in an amusing manner without seeming to dictate or insist. This was the ordinary 18th-century view of the matter, but [[Rousseau]] contested the educational value of instruction given in this indirect form.

A work by P. Soullé, ''La Fontaine et ses devanciers'' (1866), is a history of the apologue from the earliest times until its final triumph in France.

[[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] wrote a propos his ''[[Persian Letters]]'' "There are certain truths of which it is not enough to persuade, but which must be made to be ''felt''.  Such are the moral verities. Perhaps a bit of history will be more touching than subtle philosophy."

==Chivalric romance==
{{main|Romance (heroic literature)}}
As a [[literary genre]] of [[high culture]], ''romance'' or ''chivalric romance'' is a style of heroic [[prose]] and [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] [[narrative]] that was popular in the aristocratic circles of [[High Middle Ages|High Medieval]] and [[Early Modern Europe]]. They were fantastic stories about marvel-filled [[adventure]]s, often of a [[knight errant]] portrayed as having [[hero]]ic qualities, who goes on a [[quest]]. Popular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with [[Irony|ironic]], [[Satire|satiric]] or [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] intent. Romances reworked [[legend]]s, [[fairy tale]]s, and history to suit the readers' and hearers' tastes, but by ''c''.1600 they were out of fashion, and [[Miguel de Cervantes]] famously satirised them in his novel ''[[Don Quixote]]''.  Still, [[Medievalism|the modern image of "medieval"]] is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre, and the word ''medieval'' invokes knights, distressed damsels, dragons, and other romantic tropes.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis]], ''[[The Discarded Image]]'', p. 9 {{ISBN|0-521-47735-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, romance literature was written in [[Old French]], [[Anglo-Norman literature|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Occitan]], later, in [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. During the early 13th century romances were increasingly written as prose. In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of [[courtly love]], such as faithfulness in adversity.

During the [[Gothic Revival]], from ''ca.'' 1800 the connotations of "romance" moved from the magical and fantastic to somewhat eerie [[Gothic fiction|"Gothic" adventure narratives]].

==Creation myth==
{{main|Creation myth}}
A ''creation myth'' is a symbolic narrative of how the world began and how people first came to inhabit it.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="womack"&gt;{{harvnb|Womack|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MQi5x7_-eksC&amp;pg=PA81 81]}}, "Creation myths are symbolic stories describing how the universe and its inhabitants came to be. Creation myths develop through oral traditions and therefore typically have multiple versions."&lt;/ref&gt; They develop in [[oral tradition]]s and therefore typically have multiple versions;&lt;ref name="womack"/&gt; and they are the most common form of [[myth]], found throughout human [[culture]].&lt;ref name="kimball"&gt;{{harvnb|Kimball|2008}}{{page needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the society in which it is told, a creation myth is usually regarded as conveying profound [[truth (religious)|truths]], metaphorically, symbolically and sometimes even in a [[history|historical]] or literal sense.&lt;ref name="kimball"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|pp=xvii-xviii; 465}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are commonly, although not always, considered ''[[cosmogonical]] myths''—that is they describe the ordering of the [[cosmos]] from a state of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] or amorphousness.&lt;ref&gt;''See:''

*{{harvnb|Weigle|1987}}
*{{harvnb|Leonard|McClure|2004}}
*{{harvnb|Honko|1984|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creation myths often share a number of features. They often are considered [[sacred]] accounts and can be found in nearly all known [[religion|religious traditions]].&lt;ref name="johnston"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are all stories with a [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and [[character (arts)|characters]] who are either [[deity|deities]], human-like figures, or animals, who often speak and transform easily.&lt;ref&gt;''See:''

==Etiological myth==
{{Main|Myth of origins}}
An etiological myth, or origin myth, is a [[mythology|myth]] intended to explain the origins of [[Cult (religious practice)|cult practices]], natural phenomena, proper names and the like, or create a mythic history for a place or family. For example, the name [[Delphi]] and its associated deity, ''[[Apollo|Apollon Delphinios]]'', are explained in the [[Homeric Hymn]] which tells of how Apollo carried [[Crete|Cretans]] over the sea in the shape of a [[dolphin]] (''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphis}}'') to make them his priests. While Delphi is actually related to the word ''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphus}}'' ("womb"), many etiological myths are similarly based on [[folk etymology]] (the term "[[Amazons|Amazon]]", for example). In the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (published circa 17 BC), [[Vergil]] claims the descent of [[Augustus Caesar]]'s [[Julian clan]] from the hero [[Aeneas]] through his son Ascanius, also called Iulus. 
The story of [[Prometheus]]' sacrifice-trick in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' relates how Prometheus tricked [[Zeus]] into choosing the bones and fat of the first sacrificial animal rather than the meat to justify why, after a sacrifice, the Greeks offered the bones wrapped in fat to the gods while keeping the meat for themselves.

==Fable==
{{main|Fable}}
A ''fable'', as a literary genre, is a succinct fictional story, in prose or verse, that features [[animal]]s, [[mythical creatures]], [[plant]]s, [[inanimate|inanimate objects]], or [[nature|forces of nature]] that are [[anthropomorphized]] (given [[human]] qualities), and that illustrates a [[moral]] lesson (a "moral"), which may at the end be expressed explicitly in a pithy [[maxim (saying)|maxim]].

A fable differs from a [[parable]] in that the latter ''excludes'' animals, plants, inanimate objects, and forces of nature as actors that assume speech and other powers of humankind.

Usage has not always been so clearly distinguished.  In the [[King James Version]] of the [[New Testament]], "''μύθος''" ("''[[mythos]]''") was rendered by the [[Translation|translators]] as "fable"&lt;ref&gt;For example, in ''[[First Epistle to Timothy|First Timothy]]'', "neither give heed to fables...", and "refuse profane and old wives' fables..." (1 Tim 1:4 and 4:4, respectively).&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[First Epistle to Timothy|First]]'' and ''[[Second Epistle to Timothy|Second Timothy]]'', in ''[[Titus]]'' and in ''[[First Epistle of Peter|First Peter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
Strong's 3454. μύθος muthos moo'-thos; perhaps from the same as 3453 (through the idea of tuition); a tale, i.e. &lt;U&gt;fiction&lt;/U&gt; ("myth"):—fable.&lt;BR /&gt;"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty." (2nd Peter 1:16)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factoid==
{{main|Factoid}}
A ''factoid'' is a questionable or [[:wikt:spurious|spurious]] (unverified, [[falsity|false]], or fabricated) statement presented as a [[fact]], but with no [[wikt:veracity|veracity]]. The word can also be used to describe a particularly insignificant or novel fact, in the absence of much relevant context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Steve Wright's Book of Factoids |publisher=Harper |year=2006 |isbn=978-0007240296}} As read on his hit BBC Radio show "Steve Wright in the Afternoon".&lt;/ref&gt; The word is defined by the ''[[Compact Oxford English Dictionary of Current English|Compact Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as "an item of unreliable information that is repeated so often that it becomes accepted as fact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Simpson JA &amp; Weiner ESC |title=The Compact Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=2008 |isbn=0-19-861258-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Factoid'' was [[neologism|coined]] by [[Norman Mailer]] in his 1973 biography of [[Marilyn Monroe]]. Mailer described a factoid as "facts which have no existence before appearing in a magazine or newspaper",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mailer |first=Norman |title=Marilyn: A Biography |publisher=Grosset &amp; Dunlap |year=1973 |isbn=0-448-01029-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created the word by combining the word ''[[wikt:fact|fact]]'' and the ending ''[[wikt:-oid|-oid]]'' to mean "similar but not the same". The ''[[Washington Times]]'' described Mailer's new word as referring to "something that looks like a fact, could be a fact, but in fact is not a fact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/jan/23/20070123-121624-9376r/|title=Ah, there's joy in Mudville's precincts|last=Pruden|first=Wesley|authorlink=Wesley Pruden|date=January 23, 2007|work=[[The Washington Times]]|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factoids may give rise to, or arise from, [[list of common misconceptions|common misconceptions]] and [[urban legend]]s.

==Fairy tale==
{{main|Fairy tale}}
A fairy tale (pronounced /ˈfeəriˌteɪl/) is a type of short story that typically features [[folklore|folkloric]] [[fantasy]] characters, such as [[Fairy|fairies]], [[goblin]]s, [[Elf|elves]], [[troll]]s, [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]], [[giant (mythology)|giants]], [[mermaid]]s or [[gnome]]s, and usually [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[incantation|enchantments]]. However, only a small number of the stories refer to fairies. The stories may nonetheless be distinguished from other folk narratives such as [[legend]]s (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described)&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Stith. Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology &amp; Legend, 1972 s.v. "Fairy Tale"&lt;/ref&gt; and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables.

In less technical contexts, the term is also used to describe something blessed with unusual happiness, as in "fairy tale ending" (a [[happy ending]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://m-w.com/dictionary/fairy%20tale Merriam-Webster definition of "fairy tale"]&lt;/ref&gt; or "fairy tale [[romance (love)|romance]]" (though not all fairy tales end happily). Colloquially, a "fairy tale" or "''fairy story''" can also mean any far-fetched story or [[tall tale]].

In cultures where [[demon]]s and [[witch]]es are perceived as real, fairy tales may merge into [[legend]]s, where the narrative is perceived both by teller and hearers as being grounded in historical truth. However, unlike [[legend]]s and [[Epic poems|epic]]s, they usually do not contain more than superficial references to [[religion]] and actual places, people, and events; they take place [[once upon a time]] rather than in actual times.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Orenstein, ''Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked'', p. 9. {{ISBN|0-465-04125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairy tales are found in oral and in literary form. The history of the fairy tale is particularly difficult to trace because only the literary forms can survive. Still, the evidence of literary works at least indicates that fairy tales have existed for thousands of years, although not perhaps recognized as a [[genre]]; the name "fairy tale" was first ascribed to them by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]] in the late 17th century. Many of today's fairy tales have evolved from centuries-old stories that have appeared, with variations, in multiple cultures around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Richard. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/6142964/Fairy-tales-have-ancient-origin.html "Fairy tales have ancient origin."] Telegraph.co.uk. 5 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Fairy tales, and works derived from fairy tales, are still written today.

The older fairy tales were intended for an audience of adults, as well as children, but they were associated with children as early as the writings of the ''[[précieuses]]''; the [[Brothers Grimm]] titled their collection ''[[Children's and Household Tales]]'', and the link with children has only grown stronger with time.

Folklorists have classified fairy tales in various ways. The [[Aarne-Thompson classification system]] and the morphological analysis of [[Vladimir Propp]] are among the most notable. Other folklorists have interpreted the tales' significance, but no school has been definitively established for the meaning of the tales.

A fairy tale with a tragic rather a happy ending is called [[anti-fairy tale]].

==Folklore==
{{main|Folklore}}
''Folklore'' (or ''lore'') consists of [[legend]]s, [[music]], [[oral history]], [[proverb]]s, [[joke]]s, [[popular belief]]s, [[fairy tales]], [[narrative|stories]], [[tall tales]], and customs that are the [[tradition]]s of a culture, [[subculture]], or [[group (sociology)|group]]. It is also the set of practices through which those expressive genres are shared. The study of folklore is sometimes called [[folkloristics]]. The word 'folklore' was first used by the English antiquarian [[William Thoms]] in a letter published in the London journal ''The Athenaeum'' in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Georges, Robert A., Michael Owens Jones, "Folkloristics: An Introduction," [[Indiana University Press]], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In usage, there is a continuum between folklore and [[mythology]]. [[Stith Thompson]] made a major attempt to index the [[motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] of both folklore and mythology, providing an outline into which new [[motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] can be placed, and scholars can keep track of all older motifs.

Folklore can be divided into four areas of study: [[Cultural artifact|artifact]] (such as voodoo dolls), describable and transmissible entity (oral tradition), culture, and behavior ([[ritual]]s). These areas do not stand alone, however, as often a particular item or element may fit into more than one of these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Georges, Robert A., Michael Owens Jones, "Folkloristics: An Introduction," pp.313 Indiana University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folkloristics==
{{main|Folkloristics}}
''Folkloristics'' is the term preferred by academic folklorists for the formal, academic discipline devoted to the study of [[folklore]]. The term itself derives from the nineteenth-century German designation ''folkloristik'' (i.e., folklore). Ultimately, the term ''folkloristics'' is used to distinguish between the materials studied, folklore, and the study of folklore, folkloristics. In scholarly usage, ''folkloristics'' represents an emphasis on the contemporary, social aspects of expressive culture, in contrast to the more literary or historical study of cultural texts.

==Ghost story==
{{main|Ghost story}}
A ''ghost story'' may be any piece of [[fiction]], or [[drama]], or an account of an experience, that includes a [[ghost]], or simply takes as a [[premise]] the possibility of ghosts or characters' belief in them. Colloquially, the term can refer to any kind of scary story. In a narrower sense, the ghost story has been developed as a [[short story]] format, within [[genre fiction]]. It is a form of [[supernatural fiction]] and specifically of [[weird fiction]], and is often a [[horror story]]. While ghost stories are often explicitly meant to be scary, they have been written to serve all sorts of purposes, from comedy to [[morality tale]]s. Ghosts often appear in the narrative as sentinels or [[prophet]]s of things to come. Whatever their uses, the ghost story is in some format present in all cultures around the world, and may be passed down orally or in written form.

==Joke==
{{main|Joke}}
A ''[[wikt:joke|joke]]'' is something spoken, written, or done with [[humour|humorous]] intention. Jokes may have many different forms, e.g., a single word or a gesture (considered in a particular context), a question-answer, or a whole [[short story]]. The word "joke" has [[wikt:Wikisaurus:joke|a number of synonyms]].

To achieve their end, jokes may employ [[irony]], [[sarcasm]], [[word play]] and other devices.  Jokes may have a [[punch line]], i.e. an ending to make it humorous.

A [[practical joke]] or [[prank]] differs from a spoken one in that the major component of the humour is physical rather than verbal (for example placing salt in the sugar bowl).

==Legend==
{{main|Legend}}
A ''legend'' ([[Latin]], ''legenda'', "things to be read") is a [[narrative]] of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and to possess certain qualities that give the tale [[verisimilitude (literature)|verisimilitude]]. Legend, for its active and passive participants includes no happenings that are outside the realm of "possibility", defined by a highly flexible set of parameters, which may include [[miracle]]s that are perceived as actually having happened, within the specific tradition of [[indoctrination]] where the legend arises, and within which it may be transformed over time, in order to keep it fresh and vital, and [[realism (arts)|realistic]].

The [[Brothers Grimm]] defined legend as [[Folklore|folktale]] historically grounded.&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Krapf, ''Beneath the Cherry Sapling: Legends from Franconia'' (New York: Fordham University Press) 1988, devotes his opening section to distinguishing the [[genre]] of legend from other narrative forms, such as [[fairy tale]]; he "reiterates the Grimms' definition of legend as a folktale historically grounded", according to Hans Sebald's review in ''German Studies Review'' '''13'''.2 (May 1990), p 312.&lt;/ref&gt; A modern [[folklore|folklorist]]'s professional definition of ''legend'' was proposed by Timothy R. Tangherlini in 1990:&lt;ref&gt;Tangherlini, "'It Happened Not Too Far from Here...': A Survey of Legend Theory and Characterization" ''Western Folklore'' '''49'''.4 (October 1990:371-390) p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Legend, typically, is a short (mono-) episodic, traditional, highly ecotypified&lt;ref&gt;That is to say, specifically located in place and time.&lt;/ref&gt; historicized narrative performed in a conversational mode, reflecting on a psychological level a symbolic representation of folk belief and collective experiences and serving as a reaffirmation of commonly held values of the group to whose tradition it belongs."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Myth of origins==
{{main|Myth of origins}}
An ''origin myth'' is a [[myth]] that purports to describe the origin of some feature of the natural or social world. One type of origin myth is the [[creation myth|cosmogonic myth]], which describes the creation of the world. However, many cultures have stories set after the cosmogonic myth, which describe the origin of natural phenomena and human institutions within a preexisting universe.

In [[classics|Western classical scholarship]], the word ''aition'' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] αἴτιον, "cause") is sometimes used for a myth that explains an origin, particularly how an object or custom came into existence.

==Mythology==
{{main|Mythology}}
The term ''mythology'' can refer either to the ''study'' of myths, or to a ''body or collection'' of myths.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, p. 8; "myth", ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, [[comparative mythology]] is the study of connections between myths from different cultures,&lt;ref name="Littleton, p. 32"&gt;Littleton, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[Greek mythology]] is  the body of myths from [[ancient Greece]]. In the field of [[folkloristics]], a ''myth'' is defined as a [[sacred]] [[narrative]] explaining how the world and humankind came to be in their present form&lt;ref name = "dundesintro"&gt;Dundes, Introduction, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dundes, Binary, p. 45"&gt;Dundes, "Binary", p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "madness"&gt;Dundes, "Madness", p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; and how [[norm (social)|customs]], [[institution]]s and [[taboo]]s were established.&lt;ref name = "mythnature"&gt;Bascom, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "originmyth"&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars in other fields use the term "myth" in somewhat different ways.&lt;ref name = "madness"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doty, p. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In a very broad sense, the word can refer to any story originating within traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, "Defining", p. 57; Kirk, ''Myth'', p. 74; Simpson, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oral tradition==
{{main|Oral tradition}}
''Oral tradition'' and ''oral lore'' is cultural material and tradition transmitted orally from one generation to another.&lt;ref name = "Vansina"&gt;[[Jan Vansina|Vansina, Jan]]: ''Oral Tradition as History'', 1985, James Currey Publishers, {{ISBN|0-85255-007-3}}, 9780852550076; at page 27 and 28, where Vasina defines oral tradition as "verbal messages which are reported statements from the past beyond the present generation" which "specifies that the message must be oral statements spoken, sung or called out on musical instruments
 only"; "There must be transmission by word of mouth over at least a generation". He points out that "Our definition is a working definition for the use of historians. Sociologists, linguists or scholars of the verbal arts propose their own, which in, e.g., sociology, stresses common knowledge.  In linguistics, features that distinguish the language from common dialogue (linguists), and in the verbal arts features of form and content that define art (folklorists)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ki-Zerbo"&gt;Ki-Zerbo, Joseph: "Methodology and African Prehistory", 1990, ''UNESCO International Scientific Committee for the Drafting of a General History of Africa''; James Currey Publishers, {{ISBN|0-85255-091-X}}, 9780852550915; see Ch. 7; "Oral tradition and its methodology" at pages 54-61; at page 54: "Oral tradition may be defined as being a testimony transmitted verbally from one generation to another.  Its special characteristics are that it is verbal and the manner in which it is transmitted."&lt;/ref&gt; The messages or testimony are verbally transmitted in speech or song and may take the form, for example, of folktales, sayings, ballads, songs, or chants. In this way, it is possible for a society to transmit [[oral history]], [[oral literature]], [[oral law]] and other [[knowledges]] across generations without a [[writing system]].

A narrower definition of oral tradition is sometimes appropriate.&lt;ref name = "Vansina"/&gt; Sociologists might also emphasize a requirement that the material is held in common by a group of people, over several generations, and might distinguish oral tradition from [[testimony]] or [[oral history]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Henige|Henige, David]]. "Oral, but Oral What? The Nomenclatures of Orality and Their Implications" ''Oral Tradition'', 3/1-2 (1988): 229-38. p 232; Henige cites Jan Vansina (1985). Oral tradition as history. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press&lt;/ref&gt; In a general sense, "oral tradition" refers to the transmission of [[culture|cultural]] material through vocal utterance, and was long held to be a key descriptor of [[folklore]] (a criterion no longer rigidly held by all folklorists).&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Degh|Degh, Linda]]. ''American Folklore and the Mass Media''. Bloomington: IUP, 1994, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[academic discipline]], it refers both to a set of objects of study and a [[Scientific method|method]] by which they are studied&lt;ref&gt;Dundes, Alan, "Editor's Introduction" to ''The Theory of Oral Composition'', [[John Miles Foley]]. Bloomington, IUP, 1988, pp. ix-xii&lt;/ref&gt;—the method may be called variously "oral traditional theory", "the theory of [[Oral-Formulaic Composition]]" and the "Parry-Lord theory" (after two of its founders; see below)  The study of oral tradition is distinct from the academic discipline of [[oral history]],&lt;ref&gt;Henige, David. "Oral, but Oral What? The Nomenclatures of Orality and Their Implications" ''Oral Tradition'', 3/1-2 (1988): 229-38. p 232; Henige cites Jan Vansina (1985). Oral tradition as history. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press&lt;/ref&gt; which is the recording of personal memories and histories of those who experienced historical eras or events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/oral_history.html Oral History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also distinct from the study of [[orality]], which can be defined as thought and its verbal expression in societies where the technologies of [[literacy]] (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, Walter, S.J., ''Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word''. London: Methuen,  1982 p 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parable==
{{main|Parable}}
A ''parable'' is&lt;ref name="Die Gleichnisreden Jesu"&gt;Adolf Jülicher, ''Die Gleichnisreden Jesu'' (2 vols; Tübingen: Mohr [Siebeck], 1888, 1899).&lt;/ref&gt; a succinct story, in [[prose]] or [[verse (poetry)|verse]], that illustrates one or more [[moral]], [[religious]], instructive, or [[normative]] principles or lessons. It differs from a [[fable]] in that fables use animals, plants, inanimate objects, and forces of nature as actors that assume speech and other powers of humankind, while parables generally feature human characters. It is a type of [[analogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSjRcQSE2uQC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=parable+is+analogy+-.com+-blog+.edu&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=parable%20is%20analogy%20-.com%20-blog%20.edu&amp;f=false |title=What are they saying about the parables |accessdate= |author=David B.

Some scholars of the [[Canonical gospels]] and the [[New Testament]] apply the term "parable" only to the [[parables of Jesus]],&lt;ref name="A Marginal Jew"&gt;[[John P. Meier]], ''[[A Marginal Jew]]'', volume II, Doubleday, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; though that is not a common restriction of the term. Parables such as "[[Parable of the Prodigal Son|The Prodigal Son]]" are central to Jesus' teaching method in both  the [[canon law|canonical]] narratives and the [[apocrypha]].

==Political myth==
{{main|Political myth}}
A ''political myth'' is an ideological explanation for a political phenomenon that is believed by a social group.

In 1975, Henry Tudor defined it in ''Political Myth'' published by Macmillan. He said {{cquote|A myth is an interpretation of what the myth-maker (rightly or wrongly) takes to be hard fact. It is a device men adopt in order to come to grips with reality; and we can tell that a given account is a myth, not by the amount of truth it contains, but by the fact that it is ''believed'' to be true, and above all, by the dramatic form into which it is cast ... What marks a myth as being political is its subject matter ... [P]olitical myths deal with politics ... A political myth is always the myth of a particular group. It has a hero or protagonist, not an individual, but a tribe, a nation, a race, a class ... [and] it is always the group which acts as the protagonist in a political myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Yolanda Flores |editor1-last=Niemann |editor2-first=Susan |editor2-last=Armitage |editor3-first=Patricia |editor3-last=Hart |editor4-first=Karen |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Weathermon |title=Chicana leadership: the Frontiers reader |year=2002 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location= |isbn=0803283822 |page=52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdxTkGIL1osC&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=%22political%20myth%22%20and%20nationalism&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q=Henry%20Tudor's%20definition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2001, Christopher G. Flood described a working definition of a political myth as {{cquote|an ideologically marked narrative which purports to give a true account of a set of past, present, or predicted political events and which is accepted as valid in its essentials by a social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political Myth |last=Flood |first=Christopher |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location= |isbn=0415936322 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WoS7q5nTY78C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=political%20myth&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q=working%20definition&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Tall tale==
{{main|Tall tale}}
A ''tall tale'' is a story with unbelievable elements, related as if it were true and factual. Some such stories are [[exaggeration]]s of actual events, for example [[wikt:fish story|fish stories]] such as, "That fish was so big, why, I tell ya, it nearly sank the boat when I pulled it in!" Other tall tales are completely fictional tales set in a familiar setting, such as the [[European countryside]], the [[American Old West]], the [[Canadian Northwest]], or the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Tall tales are often told so as to make the narrator seem to have been a part of the story. They are usually [[humor]]ous or good-natured. The line between myth and tall tale is distinguished primarily by age; many myths exaggerate the exploits of their heroes, but in tall tales the exaggeration looms large, to the extent of becoming the whole of the story.

==Urban legend==
{{main|Urban legend}}
An ''urban legend'', ''urban myth'', ''urban tale'', or ''contemporary legend'', is a form of modern [[folklore]] consisting of stories that may or may not have been believed by their tellers to be true.&lt;ref name="believed"&gt;Brunvand, p.423&lt;/ref&gt; As with all folklore and mythology, the designation suggests nothing about the story's veracity, but merely that it is in circulation, exhibits variation over time, and carries some significance that motivates the community in preserving and propagating it.

Despite its name, an urban legend does not necessarily originate in an [[urban area]]. Rather, the term is used to differentiate modern legend from traditional [[folklore]] in pre-industrial times. For this reason, [[sociologist]]s and [[folklorist]]s prefer the term ''contemporary legend''.

Urban legends are sometimes repeated in news stories and, in recent years, distributed by [[e-mail]]. People frequently allege that such tales happened to a "[[friend of a friend]]"; so often, in fact, that "friend of a friend" ("FOAF") has become a commonly used term when recounting this type of story.

Some urban legends have passed through the years with only minor changes to suit regional variations. One example is the story of a woman killed by spiders nesting in her elaborate hairdo. More recent legends tend to reflect modern circumstances, like the story of people ambushed, anesthetized, and waking up minus one kidney, which was [[Organ theft|surgically removed]] for [[organ transplant|transplantation]] (a story which folklorists refer to as "The Kidney Heist").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mikkelson|first=Barbara|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/robbery/kidney.asp|title=snopes.com:Kidney Thief|publisher=''[[Snopes|Urban Legends Reference Pages]]''|date=2008-03-12|accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Variation''' is a characteristic of language: there is more than one way of saying the same thing. Speakers may vary pronunciation ([[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]), word choice ([[lexicon]]), or morphology and syntax (sometimes called "[[grammar]]").&lt;ref name="Meecham2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Linguistics|last1=Meecham|first1=Marjory|last2=Rees-Miller|first2=Janie|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2001|isbn=0-312-24738-9|editor1-last=O'Grady|editor1-first=William|edition=Fourth|chapter=Language in social contexts|editor2-last=Archibald|editor2-first=John|editor3-last=Aronoff|editor3-first=Mark|editor4-last=Rees-Miller|editor4-first=Janie}}&lt;/ref&gt; But while the diversity of variation is great, there seem to be boundaries on variation – speakers do not generally make drastic alterations in sentence word order or use novel sounds that are completely foreign to the language being spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Sociolinguistics|last=Wardhaugh|first=Ronald|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-3559-7|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language variation does not equate with language ungrammaticality, but speakers are still (often unconsciously) sensitive to what is and is not possible in their native tongue.

Variationists study how a language changes by observing it. This is accomplished by looking at authentic data. For example, variation is studied by looking at linguistic and social environments, then the data is analyzed as the change occurs.  Variation in research programs must be malleable due to the nature of language itself. This is because language is also fluid in transition and does not shift from one state to another instantaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Preston|first=Dennis R.|date=1993-06-01|title=Variation linguistics and SLA|journal=Second Language Research|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=153–172|doi=10.1177/026765839300900205|issn=0267-6583}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Language variation is a core concept in sociolinguistics. Sociolinguists investigate whether this linguistic variation can be attributed to differences in the ''social'' characteristics of the speakers using the language, but also investigate whether elements of the surrounding ''linguistic'' context promote or inhibit the usage of certain structures.

Studies of language variation and its correlation with [[Sociology|sociological]] categories, such as [[William Labov]]'s 1963 paper "The social motivation of a sound change," led to the foundation of sociolinguistics as a subfield of [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Labov |first=William |title=The social motivation of a sound change |doi=10.1080/00437956.1963.11659799|journal=Word |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=273–309 |year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chambers |first=J.K. |title=Sociolinguistic Theory: Linguistic Variation and its Social Significance |publisher=Blackwell |year=2003 |isbn=0-631-22882-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although contemporary sociolinguistics includes other topics, language variation and change remains an important issue at the heart of the field.

== Sociolinguistic variables ==
Studies in the field of [[sociolinguistics]] typically take a sample population and interview them, assessing the realisation of certain sociolinguistic variables. Labov specifies the ideal sociolinguistic variable to
* be high in frequency,
* have a certain immunity from conscious suppression,
* be an integral part of larger structures, and
* be easily quantified on a linear scale.&lt;ref name="Labov662"&gt;Labov, William (1966), ''The Social Stratification of English in New York City'', Diss. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Phonetics|Phonetic]] variables tend to meet these criteria and are often used, as are morphosyntactic variables, [[morphophonological]] variables, and, more rarely, lexical variables. Examples for phonetic variables are: the frequency of the [[glottal stop]], the height or backness of a [[vowel]] or the realisation of word-endings. An example of a morphosyntactic variable is the frequency of negative concord (known colloquially as a [[double negative]]). Two well-known and frequently studied morphophonological variables are T/D deletion, the optional deletion of the sound /t/ or /d/ at the end of a word, as in "I kep' walking" (Wolfram 1969;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Walt. 1969. ''A Sociolinguistic Description of Detroit Negro Speech''. Washington, DC: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Labov et al. 1968&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William, Cohen, Paul, Robins, Clarence, &amp; Lewis, John. 1968. ''A Study of the Non-standard English of Negro and Puerto Rican Speakers in New York City''. Co-operative Research Report 3288, Vol. 1. Philadelphia: U.S. Regional Survey.&lt;/ref&gt;); and the [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#G-dropping|ING variable]], the optional pronunciation of ''-ing'' at the end of a word as ''-in''', as in "I kept walkin'" (e.g. Fisher 1958;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00437956.1958.11659655|pages=47–56|title=Social Influences on the Choice of a Linguistic Variant|journal=''word''|volume=14|year=2015|last1=Fischer|first1=John L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labov 1966/1982;&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William. 1966 [1982]. ''The Social Stratification of English in New York City''. Washington, DC: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Trudgill 1974&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, Peter. 1974. ''The social differentiation of English in Norwich''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Analysis and methodology ==
Analyzing sociolinguistic variation often involves the use of statistical programs to handle its multi-variable nature. One essential part of the methodology is to count up the number of tokens of a particular variant and compare it to the number of times the variant ''could have'' occurred. This is called the "Principle of Accountability" in [[Sali Tagliamonte|Tagliamonte]] (2012). Comparing the tokens to the total number of words in a corpus or comparing one corpus to another leads to erroneous results.&lt;ref name=Tagliamonte2012&gt;Tagliamonte, Sali A. (2012). ''Variationist Sociolinguistics: Change, observation, interpretation''. UK: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19–21}} This count of the possible occurrences can be difficult at times because some variants alternate with zero (such as relative pronouns ''that'', ''who'', and zero).&lt;ref name=Tagliamonte2012 /&gt;{{rp|11–12}}

== Association with age ==
There are several different types of age-based variation one may see within a population. They are: vernacular of a subgroup with membership typically characterized by a specific age range, age-graded variation, and indications of linguistic change in progress.

One example of subgroup vernacular is the speech of street youth.  Just as street youth dress differently from the "norm", they also often have their own "language".  The reasons for this are the following: (1) To enhance their own cultural identity (2) To identify with each other, (3) To exclude others, and (4) To invoke feelings of fear or admiration from the outside world.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Strictly speaking, this is not truly age-based, since it does not apply to all individuals of that age bracket within the community. [[Age-graded variation]] is a stable variation which varies within a population based on age. That is, speakers of a particular age will use a specific linguistic form in successive generations. This is relatively rare. J.K. Chambers cites an example from southern Ontario, Canada where the name of the letter 'Z' varies.&lt;ref name="Chambers2"&gt;Chambers, J.K. (1995). ''Sociolinguistic Theory'', Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the English-speaking world pronounces it 'zed'; however, in the United States, it is pronounced 'zee'. A linguistic survey found that in 1979 two-thirds of the 12-year-olds in Toronto ended the recitation of the alphabet with the letter 'zee' where only 8% of the adults did so. Then in 1991, (when those 12-year-olds were in their mid-20s) a survey showed only 39% of the 20- to 25-year-olds used 'zee'. In fact, the survey showed that only 12% of those over 30 used the form 'zee'. This is hypothesized&lt;ref name="Chambers2" /&gt; to be tied to an American children's song frequently used to teach the alphabet. In this song, the rhyme scheme matches the letter Z with V 'vee', prompting the use of the American pronunciation. As the individual grows older, this marked form 'zee' is dropped in favor of the standard form 'zed'.&lt;ref name="Chambers2" /&gt;

People tend to use linguistic forms that were prevalent when they reached adulthood. So, in the case of linguistic change in progress, one would expect to see variation over a broader range of ages. [[William Bright]] provides an example taken from American English, where in certain parts of the country there is an ongoing merger of the vowel sounds in such pairs of words as 'caught' and 'cot'.&lt;ref name="Bright19972"&gt;Bright, William (1997). "Social Factors in Language Change." In Coulmas, Florian (ed) ''The Handbook of Sociolinguistics''. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; This merger used to be distinctive of the western United States, but since World War II, it has developed independently in two other regions: western Pennsylvania and southwestward, and the New England coast from Boston north.&lt;ref&gt;University of Pennsylvania. circa 2005. ''Phonological atlas of North America'', [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/Map1.html Map 1].&lt;/ref&gt;  Examining the speech across several generations of a single family, one would find the grandparents' generation would never or rarely merge these two vowel sounds; their children's generation may on occasion, particularly in quick or informal speech; while their grandchildren's generation would merge these two vowels uniformly. This is the basis of the [[apparent-time hypothesis]] where age-based variation is taken as an indication of linguistic change in progress.

== Association with geography ==
{{Main|Dialectology}}
A commonly studied source of variation is regional dialects. [[Dialectology]] studies variations in language based primarily on geographic distribution and their associated features. Sociolinguists concerned with grammatical and phonological features that correspond to regional areas are often called dialectologists.

== Association with gender ==
{{Main|Language and gender}}
Men and women, on average, tend to use slightly different language styles. These differences tend to be quantitative rather than qualitative. That is, to say that women use a particular speaking style more than men do is akin to saying that men are taller than women (i.e., men are on average taller than women, but some women are taller than some men).

The initial identification of a ''women's register'' was by [[Robin Lakoff]] in 1975, who argued that the style of language served to maintain women's (inferior) role in society ("female deficit approach").&lt;ref name="Lakoff2"&gt;Lakoff, R.  (1975).  ''Language and Women’s Place''.  New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; A later refinement of this argument was that gender differences in language reflected a power difference ("dominance theory").&lt;ref name="OBarr2"&gt;O’Barr, William and Bowman Atkins. (1980) "'Women’s Language' or 'powerless language'?" In McConnell-Ginet et al. (eds) ''Women and languages in Literature and Society.'' pp. 93-110. New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both these perspectives have the language style of men as normative, implying that women's style is inferior.

More recently, [[Deborah Tannen]] has compared gender differences in language as more similar to 'cultural' differences ("cultural difference approach"). Comparing conversational goals, she argued that men have a ''[[report]]'' style, aiming to communicate factual information, whereas women have a ''[[rapport]]'' style, more concerned with building and maintaining relationships.&lt;ref name="Tannen912"&gt;Tannen, Deborah. (1991). ''You Just Don’t Understand: Women and Men in Conversation.'' London: Virago.&lt;/ref&gt;

People tend to [[Communication Accommodation Theory|accommodate]] their language towards the style of the person they are interacting with. Thus, in a mixed-gender group, gender differences tend to be less pronounced. A similarly important observation is that this accommodation is usually towards the language style, not the gender of the person . That is, a polite and empathic male will tend to be accommodated to on the basis of their being polite and empathic, rather than their being male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00329|pages=171–175|title=Where is the Gender in Gendered Language?|journal=Psychological Science|volume=12|issue=2|year=2016|last1=Thomson|first1=Rob|last2=Murachver|first2=Tamar|last3=Green|first3=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Association with race ==
{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}

'''''African American English (AAE)'''''

Communities of African Americans and Whites have been popular{{To whom?|date=December 2017}} groups with particular attention to their linguistic variation. This variation helps inform much about the origins and evolution of other varieties, especially African American English.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fix|first1=Sonya|date=2014|title=AAE as a bounded ethnolinguistic resource for white women with African American ties|journal=Language &amp; Communication|volume=35|pages=55–74|doi=10.1016/j.langcom.2013.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=how does it help inform?|date=December 2017}} Understanding the sociohistorical background of the settlement of the southern colonies is a crucial{{To whom?|date=December 2017}} step in understanding the origins of AAE.&lt;ref name=":1222"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of African American Language|last=Lanehart|first=Sonja|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-19-979539-0|location=New York|pages=1–895}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[African American English]] and [[Southern American English|Southern White American English]] both had origins in the British settler dialects introduced into the South within the colonial period (1607 and 1776).&lt;ref name=":1222" /&gt; With time these two varieties continued to evolve and influences one another. However, research on African American English did not become continuously and overwhelming explored until the 1960s and 1970s with many linguists including [[Robbins Burling]], [[Ralph Fasold]], [[Joey Dillard]], [[William Labov]], Williams Stewart, [[Geneva Smitherman]], and [[Walt Wolfram]] to name a few.&lt;ref name=":1222" /&gt; While African American English is still not considered an official variety by the dominant culture and educational system in the United States, it is a legitimate and verified variety by many scholars. The Ebonics Controversy help to influence the way America thinks about African American English. In December 1996 the Ebonics Controversy erupted from the Oakland School Board's resolution to identify [[African American Vernacular English|Ebonics]] as the first language of African American students and take it into account in their Language Arts lessons{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. There have been many different perspectives{{Vague|date=December 2017}} to engaging with African American English as a variety. Although there is some evidence that linguistically sensitive approaches are helpful, there are gaps in and questions about these approaches which require new research{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. However, AAE is a rule-governed, valid language variety that adequately and uniquely expresses the collective experiences of its speakers.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shollenbarger|first=Amy|date=2017|title=How African American English-Speaking First Graders Segment and Rhyme Words and Nonwords With Final Consonant Clusters|doi=10.1044/2017_LSHSS-16-0062|journal=Language, Speech &amp; Hearing Services in Schools|volume=48|issue=4|pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Asian English'''''

Very little attention has been paid to Asian American speech despite the rise in [[Asian Americans|Asian American]] immigrants to the United States.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Wolfram, W., &amp; Schilling-Estes, N. (2005). American English: Dialects and variation. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Fought, Carmen. (2006). Language and Ethnicity. Cambridge,. UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Asian Americans are perceived as a distinct racial group, their speech has not been categorized as an individualized ethnolect. Asian Americans in particular have been seen as the “[[model minority]]”,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Kim, P. S., &amp; Lewis, G.B. 1994. “Asian-Americans in the Public-Service: Success, Diversity, and Discrimination.” Public Administration Review 54 (3): 285–90.&lt;/ref&gt; in which they are stereotyped as being comparable to whites in academic achievement and economic success. However, this assumption neglects Asian Americans who are less fortunate and may experience poverty. Furthermore, the term “Asian Americans” cover a vast diaspora of individuals from various national and ethnic origins (Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, etc.). However, this is a group in which “the dominant ideology treats as a single entity".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The homogenization of Asian Americans is problematic due to their distinct cultural and national backgrounds as well as history of immigration to the U.S. Therefore, research on Asian American speech is often homogenized because of racial homogenization. Research on Asian Americans in particular have noted the variation of Asian American speech.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21572">The '''viable system model''' ('''VSM''') is a [[model (abstract)|model]] of the organisational structure of any [[autonomous]] [[system]] capable of producing itself. A viable system is any system organised in such a way as to meet the demands of surviving in the changing environment. One of the prime features of systems that survive is that they are adaptable. The VSM expresses a model for a viable system, which is an abstracted [[cybernetic]] (regulation theory) description that is claimed to be applicable to any organisation that is a viable system and capable of autonomy.

== Overview ==
The model was developed by [[operations research]] theorist and [[cybernetics|cybernetician]] [[Anthony Stafford Beer|Stafford Beer]] in his book ''Brain of the Firm'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;''Brain of the Firm'', Beer Allen Lane, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Beer's earlier works on cybernetics applied to management, this book effectively founded [[management cybernetics]].

The first thing to note about the cybernetic theory of organizations encapsulated in the VSM is that viable systems are [[recursion|recursive]]; viable systems contain viable systems that can be modeled using an identical cybernetic description as the higher (and lower) level systems in the containment hierarchy (Beer expresses this property of viable systems as ''cybernetic isomorphism'').
A development of this model has originated the theoretical proposal called [[viable systems approach]].
[[File:VSM Default Version English with two operational systems.png|thumb|An exemplary model of a corporation as a viable system. Assumption: There is one System 1 purchasing external resources and one System 1 which produces the value, delivered to the customers. The VSM applies for all kinds of organizations.]]

== Components ==
Here we give a brief introduction to the cybernetic description of the organization encapsulated in a single level of the VSM.&lt;ref&gt;''Brain of the Firm'', 2nd Edition, Pg 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

A viable system is composed of five interacting subsystems which may be mapped onto aspects of organizational structure. In broad terms Systems 1–3.&lt;ref&gt;''Brain of the Firm'', 2nd Edition, Pg 167.&lt;/ref&gt; are concerned with the 'here and now' of the organization's operations, System 4 is concerned with the 'there and then' – strategical responses to the effects of external, environmental and future demands on the organization.&lt;ref&gt;''Brain of the Firm'', 2nd Edition, Pg 181.&lt;/ref&gt; System 5 is concerned with balancing the 'here and now' and the 'there and then' to give policy directives which maintain the organization as a viable entity.&lt;ref&gt;''Brain of the Firm'', 2nd Edition, Pg 201.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''System 1'' in a viable system contains several primary activities. Each System 1 primary activity is itself a viable system due to the recursive nature of systems as described above. These are concerned with performing a function that implements at least part of the key transformation of the organization.
* ''System 2'' represents the information channels and bodies that allow the primary activities in System 1 to communicate between each other and which allow System 3 to monitor and co-ordinate the activities within System 1.  Represents the scheduling function of shared resources to be used by System 1.
* ''System 3'' represents the structures and controls that are put into place to establish the rules, resources, rights and responsibilities of System 1 and to provide an interface with Systems 4/5. Represents the big picture view of the processes inside of System 1.
* ''System 4'' is made up of bodies that are responsible for looking outwards to the environment to monitor how the organization needs to adapt to remain viable.
* ''System 5'' is responsible for policy decisions within the organization as a whole to balance demands from different parts of the organization and steer the organization as a whole.
In addition to the subsystems that make up the first level of recursion, the environment is represented in the model. The presence of the environment in the model is necessary as the domain of action of the system and without it there is no way in the model to contextualize or ground the internal interactions of the organization.

''Algedonic alerts'' (from the Greek αλγος, pain and ηδος, pleasure) are alarms and rewards that escalate through the levels of recursion when actual performance fails or exceeds capability, typically after a [[Timeout (telecommunication)|timeout]].

The model is derived from the architecture of the brain and nervous system. Systems 3-2-1 are identified with the ancient brain or [[autonomic nervous system]]. System 4 embodies cognition and conversation. System 5, the higher brain functions, include introspection and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;''Brain of the Firm'' Chapters 6 and 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules for the viable system ==
In "Heart of Enterprise"&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Wiley 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; a companion volume to "Brain...", Beer applies [[William Ross Ashby|Ashby's]] concept of (Requisite) [[Variety (cybernetics)|Variety]]: the number of possible states of a system or of an element of the system.  There are two aphorisms that permit observers to calculate Variety; four Principles of Organization; the Recursive System Theorem; three Axioms of Management and a Law of Cohesion. These rules ensure the Requisite Variety condition is satisfied, in effect that resources are matched to requirement.

=== Regulatory aphorisms ===
These aphorisms are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11469665|title=Diagnosing the system for organizations|last=Stafford.|first=Beer,|date=1985|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0471906751|location=Chichester [West Sussex]|oclc=11469665}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beer|first=Stafford|date=1984|title=The Viable System Model: Its Provenance, Development, Methodology and Pathology|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2581927|journal=The Journal of the Operational Research Society|volume=35|issue=1|pages=7–25|doi=10.2307/2581927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It is not necessary to enter the black box to understand the nature of the function it performs.
* It is not necessary to enter the black box to calculate the variety that it potentially may generate.

=== Principles of organization ===
(Principles are 'primary sources of particular outcome')

These principles are:
* Managerial, operational and environmental varieties diffusing through an institutional system, tend to equate; they should be ''designed'' to do so with minimum damage to people and cost.
* The four directional channels carrying information between the management unit, the operation, and the environment must each have a higher capacity to transmit a given amount of information relevant to variety selection in a given time than the originating subsystem has to generate it in that time.
* Wherever the information carried on a channel capable of distinguishing a given variety crosses a boundary, it undergoes [[Transducer|transduction]] (converting energy from one form to another); the variety of the transducer must be at least equivalent to the variety of the channel.
* The operation of the first three principles must be cyclically maintained without delays.''

=== Recursive system theorem ===
This theorem states:
* In a [[recursion|recursive]] organizational structure any viable system contains, and is contained in, a viable system.

=== Axioms ===
(Axioms are statements 'worthy of belief')

These axioms are:
* The sum of horizontal variety disposed by ''n'' operational elements (systems one) equals the sum of the vertical variety disposed by the six vertical components of corporate cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in "The Heart of Enterprise" pp 214- 217&lt;/ref&gt; (The six are from Environment, System Three*, the System Ones, System Two, System Three and Algedonic alerts.)
* The variety disposed by System Three resulting from the operation of the First Axiom equals the variety disposed by System Four.
* The variety disposed by System Five equals the residual variety generated by the operation of the Second Axiom.

=== The law of cohesion for multiple recursions of the viable system ===
This law ('something invariant in nature') states:
* The System One variety accessible to System Three of recursion ''x'' equals the variety disposed by the sum of the metasystems of recursion ''y'' for every recursive pair.&lt;ref&gt;"The Heart of Enterprise" page 353: ''x'' belongs to metasystem (5, 4, 3, 2) ''y'' and are one level apart.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring performance==
[[Image:performance.png|thumb|360px|Three measures of capacity producing three measures of achievement]]
In ''Brain of the Firm'' (p.&amp;nbsp;163) Beer describes a triple vector to characterize activity in a System 1. The components are:
* Actuality: "What we ''are'' managing to do now, with existing resources, under existing constraints."
* Capability: "This is what we ''could'' be doing (still right now) with existing resources, under existing constraints, if we really worked at it."
* Potentiality: "This is what we ought to be doing by developing our resources and removing constraints, although still operating within the bounds of what is already known to be feasible."

Beer adds "It would help a lot to fix these definitions clearly in the mind." System 4's job is essentially to realize potential. He then defines 
* Productivity: is the ratio of actuality and capability;
* Latency: is the ratio of capability and potentiality;
* Performance: is the ratio of actuality and potentiality, and also the product of latency and productivity.
Consider the management of a process with cash earnings or savings for a company or government: 
:Potentially £100,000 but aiming to make £ 60,000. Actually sales, savings or taxes of £40,000 are realized.
:So Potentiality = £100,000; Capability = £60,000; Actuality = £40,000.
:Thus latency = 60/100 = 0.6; Productivity = 40/60 = 0.67; And performance = 0.6 &amp;times; 0.67 = 0.4 (or actuality/potential 40/100).
These methods (also known as normalisations) can be similarly applied in general e.g. to hours worked in the performance of tasks or products in a production process of some kind.

When actuality deviates from capability, because someone did something well or something badly, an algedonic alert is sent to management. If corrective action, adoption of a good technique or correction of an error, is not taken in a timely manner the alert is escalated. Because the criteria are applied in an [[Order theory|ordered]] hierarchy the management itself need not be, but the routine response functions must be ordered to reflect best known [[heuristic]] practice. These heuristics are constantly monitored for improvement by the organization's System 4s.

Pay structures reflect these constraints on performance when capability or potential is realized with, for example, productivity [[Performance-related pay|bonuses]], [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]] agreements and [[intellectual property]] rights.

==Metalanguage==
[[Image:Beer Metalnaguage.PNG|thumb|right|150px|Resolving undecidability by raising the metalanguage]]
In ascending the recursions of the viable system the context of each autonomous 5-4-3-2 [[metasystem]] enlarges and acquires more [[Variety (cybernetics)|variety]].

This defines a [[metalanguage]] stack of increasing capability to resolve [[undecidable problem|undecidability]] in the autonomous lower levels. If someone near process level needs to innovate to achieve potential, or restore capability, help can be secured from management of higher variety.

An algedonic alert, sent when actuality deviates by some [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] amount from capability, makes this process automatic.

The notion of adding more variety or states to resolve [[ambiguity]] or undecidability (also known as the [[decision problem]]) is the subject of [[Chaitin]]'s [[metamathematics|metamathematical]] conjecture [[algorithmic information theory]] and provides a potentially rigorous theoretical basis for a general management heuristic. If a process is not producing the agreed product more information, if applicable, will correct this, resolve ambiguity, [[conflict resolution|conflict]] or undecidability.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Thesis- Total System.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Thesis: The Total System]] --&gt;

In "Platform for Change" (Beer 1975) the thesis is developed via a collection of papers to learned bodies, including UK Police and Hospitals, to produce a visualization of the "Total System". Here a "Relevant ethic" evolves from "Experimental ethics" and the "Ethic with a busted gut" to produce a sustainable earth with reformed "old institutions" becoming "new institutions" driven by approval (eudemonic&lt;ref&gt;[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/asc/EUDEMONY.html Eudemony] -sustainable, ethical pleasure c.f. immediate [[hedonic|hedonistic]] pleasure. See also [[Eudaimonia]]&lt;/ref&gt; criteria "Questions of Metric" in Platform... pp 163– 179) from the "software milieu" while culture adopts the [[systems approach]] and "[[Homo faber]]" (man the maker) becomes "Homo Gubernator"  (self-steering).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Stokes Bio - Homo Gubernator: Emotions and Human Self-Steering |url=http://www.ucd.ie/sociolog/sociologyinfo/html/pstokesbio.htm |publisher=University College Dublin |accessdate=26 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209180202/http://www.ucd.ie/sociolog/sociologyinfo/html/pstokesbio.htm |archivedate=February 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applying VSM==
In applying the VSM [[Variety (cybernetics)|variety]] measures are used to match people, machines and money to jobs that produce products or services. In a set of processes some jobs are done by one person. Some are done by many and often many processes are done by the same person. Throughout the working day a participant, in completing a task, may find the focus shifts between internal and external Systems 1–5 from moment to moment.

The choices, or decisions discriminated, and their cost (or effort) defines the variety and hence resources needed for the job. The processes (Systems 1) are operationally managed by System 3 by monitoring performance and assuring (System 2) the flow of product between System 1s and out to users.

System 3 is able to audit (via 3*) past performance so "bad times" for production can be compared to "good times". If things go wrong and levels of [[risk]] increase the System 3 asks for help or puts it to colleagues for a remedy. This is the pain of an algedonic alert, which can be automatic when performance fails to achieve capability targets. The autonomic 3–2–1 homeostatic loop's problem is absorbed for solution within the autonomy of its metasystem. Development (the System 4 role of research and marketing) is asked for recommendations.

If more resources are required System 5 has to make the decision on which is the best option from System 4. Escalation to higher management (up the metalinguistic levels of recursion) will be needed if the remedy requires more resources than the current level of capability or variety can sustain. The pleasure of an algedonic alert which are performance improving innovations can also be handled in this way.

In a small business all these functions might be done by one person or shared between the participants. In larger enterprises roles can differentiate and become more specialized emphasizing one or more aspects of the VSM. Local conditions, the environment and nature of the service or product, determines where warehousing, sales, advertising, promotion, dispatch, taxation, finance, salaries etc., fit into this picture. Not all enterprises charge for their transactions (e.g. some schools and medical services, policing) and voluntary staff may not be paid. Advertising or shipping might not be part of the business or they might be the principal activity. Whatever the circumstances, all enterprises are required to be useful to their users if they are to remain viable. For all participants the central question remains: "Do I do what I always do for this transaction or do I innovate?"  It is embodied in the calls on System 4. The VSM describes the constraints: a knowledge of past performance and how it may be improved.

Beer dedicated ''Brain of the Firm'' to his colleagues past and present with the words "''absolutum obsoletum''" which he translated as "If it works it’s out of date".

Oversized fashion, distinct from [[plus-size clothing|plus-sized fashion]], consists of clothing and other accessories that are larger than normal and reflect some sort of attitude, message, or trend of the period at hand. While oversized fashion trends from the 1920s to the turn of the century vary from decade to decade, there are many overarching themes that have been expressed during the past one hundred or so years. [[Masculinity]], for example, has played a large role in many of the underlying communications of the fashions, although virility is manifested differently in the clothing depending on the era. Oversized fashion production, furthermore, runs largely parallel with the states of the [[Economic history of the United States|American]] and [[Economic history of the world|global economies]]. Modernly, oversized fashion has taken on a new form - primarily in the realm of oversized [[Fashion accessory|accessories]].

==The 1920s==
[[File:Gloriaswanson.jpg|thumb|left|Chiffon Evening Dress 1921]]

The 1920s were marked by a post-war aesthetic. After World War I, the fashion world experienced a great switch: from tight corsets and hobble skirts—to shapeless, oversized, and sparsely decorated garments.&lt;ref&gt;Peacock, J. (1997). ''The 1920s''. London, UK: Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; Women began to wear more comfortable fashions, including blousy skirts and trousers. Further, this era gave birth to sportswear fashion. Sportswear, previously recognized as America’s main contribution to fashion, consisted of a casual more relaxed style.&lt;ref&gt;Peacock, J. (1993). ''20th-Century Fashion: The complete sourcebook''. London, UK: Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coco Chanel]], known as the first modern dressmaker, made one of the greatest contributions to style in the 1920s: the two-piece dress. She created two-piece dresses out of [[jersey (fabric)]], a comfortable stretchy fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, A., &amp; Gold, A. (1991). ''90 Years of Fashion''. New York, NY: Fairchild Fashion Group.&lt;/ref&gt; The American public was receptive, embracing this relaxed style, which was perfect for the active woman on the go. The combination of these new ideas yielded this loosely fitted, modernized style.

The "boyish figure", moreover, became a prevalent trends of the era, with shapeless silhouettes and dropped [[waistline (clothing)|waistlines]] giving a more masculine look to the female figure. The emphasis on a flattened chest revolutionized the construction of undergarments. Along with this new silhouette, 1920s fashions were further modernized by the coming of a new generation of sewing-machines, each with an individual electric motor, enabling designers to create more oversized fashions, while saving time and resources.

In contrast to the "boyish figure" were the types of hats and accessories women wore in "the roaring twenties".&lt;ref&gt;Milbank, C. R. (1989), ''90 Years of Fashion''. New York, NY: Fairchild Fashion Group.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flapper dress]]es were juxtaposed with oversized hats, often trimmed with large bows, feathers, ribbons, or sequins. Furthermore, bold headbands were often worn to compliment women's customarily shorter hair lengths. Since a lot of women's fashion from this decade were quite masculine in style, many women adorned them with accessories that were rather feminine.

Music also had an influence in the ways in which fashions evolved. The [[Jazz Age]] saw the popularization of flaps in dresses; and stars such as the entertainer [[Josephine Baker]] became known for their semi-translucent flapper frocks.

==The 1930s==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10027, Pariser Modell.jpg|thumb|right|Model sporting altered flowy ensemble 1930]] 
The 1930s started in depression and ended with the onset of [[World War II]]. With rising unemployment and despair, no industry was left unaffected. In the fashion industry, designers cut their prices and produced new lines of ready-to-wear clothes, along with clothing made of more economical and washable fabrics, such as [[rayon]] and [[nylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Costantino, M., &amp; Price, R. (1992), ''Fashions of a Decade: The 1930s''. New York, NY: Facts on File.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Coco Chanel]] showed a collection of evening dresses made of cotton and sold dresses reduced by 50%. The fashions of the 1930s were stylish and elegant, with flowing lines and Paris-based coutures.

Since many women could not afford to update their wardrobes, women changed their look by resorting to alterations to exemplify the oversized fashion of the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Peacock2007&gt;Peacock, J., &amp; Peacock, J. (2007), ''Fashion Since 1900: The complete sourcebook''. London, UK: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; They used lengthening bands of contrasting fabric and added fur to their hems. This inventive way to put together new articles of clothing gave birth to the "Feedsack Dress"; constructed from the material of a sack of animal feed, these frocks were typically cut similarly to shift dresses. This [[A-line (clothing)|A-line]] cuts were boxy and contrasted the slinky and sensual [[bias (textile)|bias]]-cut dresses that became famous during the same era for their ability to cover the woman's body while clinging to each curve. Furthermore, material was added to collars and sleeves. Another trend rising from the 1930s was the "Banjo Sleeve", created by sewing two rectangular pieces of fabric with the top seam only sewn halfway to allow the arm to flow out. The boxy shape was oversized and blousy. As the era progressed, skirts that flared out fell to the bottom of the calf and sleeves were loosely tied as they fell from the elbow to wrist.

From the harsh economic conditions of the time came about the glamorous [[1930s in film]], and the glamorous clothing worn seen on the screen grew in popularity. Dresses constructed from [[Chiffon (fabric)|Chiffon]] fabric were rather loose-fitting as they flew away from the body,&lt;ref&gt;Peacock, J. (1997). ''The 1930s''. London, UK: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; and embodied the elegance that was maintained throughout the 1930s despite the economic struggles.

==The 1940s==
[[File:US Naval Hospital San Diego Nurses Modeling Uniforms ca1944.jpg|thumb|left|[[San Diego]] nurses in A-line skirts 1944]]
During the first half of the 1940s, many clothing-related commodities were in short supply due to [[World War II]]; the United States Government relinquished numerous products for utilization in warfare. [[Leather]], for example, was much used in the uniforms of American servicemen—so the material, to a large extent, went out of use in mainstream fashion.&lt;ref name="Lansdell"&gt;Lansdell, A. (1999). ''Everyday Fashions of the 20th Century''. Pembrokeshire, UK: Shire Publications, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, oversized fashion utilizing excessive amounts of material was not in style.

Designers such as [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]], Digby Morton, and [[Norman Hartnell]], however, utilized oversized fashion practices in their early 1940s collections to manifest the consequential happenings of the war.&lt;ref name=Peacock2007 /&gt; While men were abroad taking up arms, many women took on their positions in factories and offices. Accordingly, women’s fashion became more masculine. Wide-legged slacks and pronounced shoulder pads became all the rage, and most American women embraced the virile style.&lt;ref name="Lansdell"/&gt;

Not until the second half of the decade, though, with the introduction of [[Christian Dior S.A.|Dior’s “New Look,”]] was oversized fashion widely put to use. [[Christian Dior S.A.|Dior’s “New Look,”]] which first grew in popularity in [[Europe]], featured full skirts that reached the mid-calves.&lt;ref name="Lansdell"/&gt; When Dior initially set in motion this new style, the fashion house received a lot of criticism. [[Stafford Cripps|Sir Stafford Cripps]], then President of the [[Board of Trade|Britain’s Board of Trade]], was quoted as saying that the “New Look” was “utterly stupid” and an enormous waste of labor and materials.&lt;ref&gt;Kennett, F. (1983), ''The Collector's Book of Fashion''. New York, NY: Crown Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; He was not the only one opposed to the excessive usage of material. In the U.S, legislation was passed that restricted yardage in fabric for clothing, under a policy entitled L-85.

Many American citizens resisted the new legislation, with groups being formed such as the “A Little Below the Knee Club” in Texas. However, in the U.S, [[Christian Dior S.A.|Dior’s "New Look"]] was also shaping the trends of the time. [[Claire McCardell|Designer Claire McCardell]], influenced by Parisian design, created the monastic dress, in jersey, featuring a criss-cross string belt at midriff and a draped full skirt. A few years later, however, once World War II ended, the “New Look” and its oversized flair was relished both within the fashion world and the consumer market.

==The 1950s==
[[File:Audrey Hepburn screentest in Roman Holiday trailer.jpg|thumb|right|Audrey Hepburn in "[[Roman Holiday]]"]]
The post-war era of the 1950s brought a change to the family dynamic as well as to the fashion world. In 1947, [[Christian Dior]] launched as the first collection from his fashion house his "Corelle line",&lt;ref&gt;Peacock, J. (1997). ''The 1950s''. London, UK: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; which featured oversized designs. The "Corelle line" became the look of the decade, ushering femininity, luxury and grace into the era, and making a great impacct on the female silhouette. This change implemented by Christian Dior dominated the decade.&lt;ref name=Peacock2007 /&gt;

Clothes transformed from boxy styles, with square shoulders, to feminine and luxurious, with soft shoulder lines, corseted waists, round padded hips, and long skirts, leading to the knee-length "sack" dress. The knee-length skirts and dresses were the most oversized items of this 1950s. The introduction of new fabrics, including [[Terylene]], [[Orlon]], [[Banlon]], [[Acrilan]] and [[Poplin]], allowed for new fashion styles to be both created and introduced. Among these were the "wash-and-wear" sweater, the permanently pleated skirt, and the "drip-dry" skirt. Skirts of this era known as circle skirts were supported by layers of petticoats, creating a circular look that accentuated the waist line. Essentially, the petticoat reinforced the femininity of this period.&lt;ref&gt;Milbank, C. R. (1989). ''New York Fashion: The evolution of American style''. New York, NY: Abrams.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s woman also tended to be influenced by the fashions worn by movie stars such as [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Audrey Hepburn]]. Hepburn in her roles in various movies such as ''Roman Holiday'' famously wore an oversized skirt that accentuated her waist, together with a tighter shirt.

==The 1960s==
[[File:White House Dinner in honor of President of Tunisia. President Habib Bourguiba, Mrs. Bourguiba, Mrs. Kennedy... - NARA - 194199.jpg|thumb|left|Mrs.Kennedy and President of Tunisia (Mr. Habib Bourguiba) with Wife (Mrs. Bourguiba)]]
The look of the 1960s was in marked contrast to the “New Look” developed in the end of the 1940s that heavily influenced trends of the 1950s with femininity and sensuality. The look of the 1960s reflected the main issue of that time: Civil Rights. The 1960s woman “demanded equal rights and equal pay, wanted to be free, to look young and to have fun”.&lt;ref&gt;Peacock, J. (1998). ''The 1960s''. London, UK: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; Oversized fashions were utilized in more subtle ways in this decade, giving rise to trends that revolutionized the working woman and gave a voice to more conservative feminines.

To achieve this youthful and flirty look, skirts were shortened, creating a look reminiscent of the 1920s. During this era, in 1965, the [[miniskirt]] was developed. An alternative to this exposed look was in high demand, thus leading to the creation of the [[midi skirt]]. This new "midi" mainly featured a pleated A-line bodice, which allowed it to flow away from the body. This oversized fashion began to make its way to the workplace as it provided both femininity and formality. Evening wear was also affected, and both long and short dresses could be seen at engagements. Designs embraced the oversized look through more elegant silhouettes, specially in evening wear, which boasted loose forms and fluid fabrics. The change in fashion during this period was also due to international influences such as from London and France, where designers were young. A notable point about this period is that women also began to wear pants-suits and jeans.&lt;ref&gt;Connikie, Y. (1990). ''Fashions of a Decade: The 1960s''. New York, NY: Facts on File.&lt;/ref&gt;

The materials used for both clothing and accessories changed during this era. Increasingly used were easy-care synthetic fabrics such as [[Crimplene]], [[Dacron]] and Terylene. The benefits of such synthetic fabrics were that they were crease-resistant, easy to wash, and required little to no ironing. Designers such as [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]] embraced these new types of materials, using them in oversized dolman-sleeve jackets. The pattern for this piece was cut in a rectangular shape forming a boxy blousy look.&lt;ref&gt;Rasche, A., &amp; Ringena, H. (2010). ''Sixties Fashion: Modefotografie &amp; -illustration = fashion photography &amp; illustration''.  Cologne, GR: Walther Konig.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, synthetic yarns that took dyes easily were used. Leather-look plastic also helped to create a vibrant feel to accessories such as shoes, umbrellas and additional clothing items such as mini-skirts.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D. (1998), ''Fashionable Clothing from the Sears' Catalogs: Late 1960s''. Atglen, PA: Schiffer Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; While in this era, clothing became split along lines of age, there were overriding oversized trends including: midi skirts, [[Dolman sleeve]]s, loose jackets and shapeless frocks. Another factor contributing to the trends of this period was the “post-industrial boom” that helped to generate wealth in the United States. [[Jackie Kennedy]], wife of President John F. Kennedy, became a model of French fashions and helped to spur the spread of the miniskirt, along with [[Twiggy]], who gained iconic status as the face and body of the era wearing the shapeless mod dresses that were a huge trend. Jackie Kennedy’s “beehive” hairstyle also highlighted oversized fashion.

==The 1970s==
[[File:1970sgirl2.jpg|thumb|right|Fashion circa 1973]]
The 1970s is often referred to as the “Me Decade”,&lt;ref&gt;Herald, J. (1992). ''Fashions of a Decade: The 1970s''. New York, NY: Facts on File.&lt;/ref&gt; a term originally coined by writer [[Tom Wolfe]]. There were many groups, such as political and extremist groups, wanting a piece of the action. With respect to dress, it was an “anything goes” era, without rules. This manifested in some ways via the production of oversized fashion.

Fashion styles were inspired by previous decades, hinting at both nostalgia and an interest in other cultures. The current political and economic situation of the United States, including the civil rights, [[Unemployment|unemployment levels]], war and terrorism, were reflected in the manner in which individuals dressed. With the women’s movement of the 1970s, radical feminists could be stereotyped for their anti-high fashion sentiments; these women required low maintenance and made a statement. With regards to high fashion, established fashion houses produced more ready-to-wear collections and casual attire.

With nostalgia a big theme of this period, secondhand clothes were key. Similar to the 1950s, 1920s clothing also influenced this decade, along with fashions of the '30s, '40s and '50s. Television and movies such as ''[[The Godfather]]'' and ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' also played homage to styles of the past. When not inspired by nostalgia, fashion took another turn whereby "the idea was to appear as if your body had been spray painted". To achieve this look, leotards were worn and were accessorized with short frilled skirts, cap sleeves and [[leg-warmers]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D. (1998), ''Fashionable Clothing from the Sears' Catalogs: Early 1970s''. Atglen, PA: Schiffer Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; “[[Hot pants]]” or skimpy shorts were also popular in the beginning of the '70s. By the mid-1970s, we see the reemergence of “unstructured design” from the fashion houses.&lt;ref&gt;Peacock, J. (1997), ''The 1970s''. London, UK: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; These were considered the simplest cuts, appearing to look as if no skilled cutting was required. Typical of this cut is [[Issey Miyake]]’s wool cowboy look for winter 1978-79, an example of experimentation in textured knitting. The unstructured design of the 1970s highlights the oversized fashion of the decade.

==The 1980s==

The beginning of the 1980s was the first time when [[Women in the workplace|women assumed high-status roles in the workplace]]. Akin to the 1940s, women’s fashion in the 1980s was quite masculine, which was a reflection of women wanting to be taken seriously as working professionals. The three most important designers at the start of this decade, [[Calvin Klein (fashion designer)|Calvin Klein]], [[Giorgio Armani]], and [[Ralph Lauren]], were designing clothing that was characterized by broad and square shoulders.&lt;ref name="Carnegy"&gt;Carnegy, V. (1990), ''Fashions of a Decade: The 1980s''. New York, NY: Facts on File.&lt;/ref&gt; This use of oversized shoulders was largely a demonstration of women not wanting to be viewed by their feminine figures, but rather to be viewed equally in their careers.

Designers such as [[Rei Kawakubo]] of [[Comme des Garçons]] and [[Yohji Yamamoto]] began designing with a Japanese-inspired aesthetics. Clothing became much more oversized to better resemble [[kimono]]s and other flowing Japanese garments.&lt;ref name="Carnegy"/&gt; As with oversized shoulders, this Japanese style had the effect of disguising the womanly shape. [[Donna Karan]], who became known at the time as [[Donna Karan|“the Queen of 7th Avenue,”]], also began utilizing this Japanese style of dress.

Figures both within and outside the fashion world took on this [[gender neutrality|gender-neutral]] style and made the look ever more popular. Singer, actress, and model [[Grace Jones]] was a key figure in furthering this type of fashion—keeping her hair short and wearing manly, oversized clothing. Scottish singer [[Annie Lennox]] did the same, but had much more of an effect in the musical realm.&lt;ref name="Carnegy"/&gt;

Another essential person who helped further the style of oversized fashion in the 1980s was [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]], who for her [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer|wedding]] to [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] in July 1981 wore an oversized wedding dress—making the tailor popular all around the world for the remainder of the decade.

==The 1990s==
[[File:Ciara Live.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ciara|Singer Ciara]] performing in oversized T-shirt and sports bra]]
The 1990s was one of the most diverse eras for fashion. As the fashion world began to experience technological modernization, along with a widespread support from mainstream consumers, the industry felt the need to appeal to different types of audiences. Some of the women’s fashion trends included neon and pastel colors, legging and exercise wear, the hippie look, and a [[hip-hop]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, R., Cumming, V., &amp; Price, R. (1992). ''Fashions of a Decade: The 1990s''. New York, NY: Facts on File.&lt;/ref&gt; The last of those examples, hip-hop style, is identifiable as the oversized fashion of the '90s. The influence of hip-hop on urban fashion was overtly strong. Urban fashion was distinctly designed for African-American youth.

The 1990s urban style heavily influenced by [[Black Nationalism]] and African trends began with the blousy pant sported by famous figures in the rap world such as [[MC Hammer]], who popularized oversized "[[Hammer pants]]", and [[Fez (hat)|fezzes]]. However, men were not the only ones to embrace this new form of street wear. Women too began to explore the trend. The group [[TLC (band)]] and R&amp;B singer [[Aaliyah]] created their own urban fashion for women.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, E. (2012). ''Free Stylin': How hip-hop changed the fashion industry''. Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; The trend consisted of wearing oversized pants and big flannel shirts. The hardcore aspect of rap did not fully permit the women to embrace a feminine look that might make them appear weaker.&lt;ref&gt;Light, A. (1999), ''The Vibe History of Hip-Hop'', New York, NY: Three Rivers Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some femininity was maintained by the wearing of more fitted shirts, bare midsections and sports bras, while still being hard with the blousy pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Welters, L., &amp; Cunningham, P. A. (2005). ''Twentieth-Century American Fashion''. Oxford, UK: Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the upheaval of the streetwear fashion, models of color began to make their mark in the industry. It was during the 1990s that [[Tyra Banks]] found fame. After being rejected by six modeling agency the young Banks was signed by [[Elite Model Management]], and in her first season as a model she booked 25 shows in [[Paris Fashion Week]]. Banks' seductive walk impressed designers and made her a hot commodity. Designers who were influenced by the new oversized streetwear were more likely to book models of color to show their designs. Other famous models of color during the time include [[Naomi Campbell]] and [[Iman (model)|Iman]]. Undoubtedly, oversized fashion marked the beginning of a new trend for urban youth during the 1990s.

==The 2000s==
[[File:Rachel Zoe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rachel Zoe]] in oversized sunglasses]]
Women’s oversized fashion at the turn of the century is largely displayed in various [[Fashion accessory|accessories]]. At the beginning of the 2000s, many designers began using sizable and bulky glasses and jewelry in their lines, and women in the spheres of fashion, music, and film began wearing these oversized decorations. Celebrities such as [[Nicole Richie]] and [[Rachel Zoe]] helped to further this wearing of oversized [[fashion accessory|accessories]], and assisted in making the items popular in everyday wear.&lt;ref&gt;"Rachel Zoe Will Have a Fashion Line — and Then a Child, If Her Schedule Allows". nymag.com. June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As the decade progressed, the utility of oversized accessories did not wane, but rather became even more widely used.

Since the year 2006, three designers have garnered massive amounts of attention for their adoption of oversized fashion: [[Stella McCartney]], [[Alexander McQueen]], and [[Marc Jacobs]]. In 2006, [[Alexander McQueen|McQueen]] put on a show in which an enormous hologram of [[Kate Moss]] dressed in yards of rippling fabric adorned the backdrop of [[Runway (fashion)|catwalk]];&lt;ref&gt;Foley, B. (2008). "Hail McQueen". ''W magazine''. Archived from the original on 20 November 2008. Retrieved 25 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; this move furthered the attention of oversized fashion and made [[Kate Moss|Moss]] the poster model for oversized styling. The death of [[Alexander McQueen|McQueen]] in February 2010 led to his style of fashion accruing even more attention, which put oversized fashion even more on the map.

Another exhibition of the trend is the oversized handbag. Designers such as [[Balenciaga]], [[Betsey Johnson]], and [[Michael Kors]] began producing [[Handbag|purses]] and satchel-like bags that were larger than usual and complied with the oversized aesthetic. As a result of the enormous increase in influence of the internet and social media, these bags quickly became very popular after pictures of celebrities carrying them were posted online for many to see and then emulate.

The reviews of oversized fashion use in the new millennium have been mixed. Some designers and critics have welcomed the utilization of oversized accessories, while others view the trend as prodigal. Young designers and fashion houses such as [[Stella McCartney|McCartney]], [[Alexander McQueen|McQueen]], and [[Marc Jacobs|Jacobs]] generally esteem oversized accessories, while older and more established couturiers such as [[Chanel]] find much oversized [[Fashion accessory|accessories]] distasteful and extravagant.
