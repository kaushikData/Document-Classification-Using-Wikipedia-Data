An '''academic''' or '''scholarly journal''' is a [[periodical publication]] in which scholarship relating to a particular [[list of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] is published. Academic journals serve as permanent and transparent forums for the presentation, scrutiny, and discussion of research. They are usually [[peer-review]]ed or refereed.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Content typically takes the form of articles presenting [[original research]], [[review article]]s, and [[book reviews]]. The purpose of an academic journal, according to [[Henry Oldenburg]] (the first editor of ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]''), is to give researchers a venue to "impart their knowledge to one another, and contribute what they can to the Grand design of improving natural knowledge, and perfecting all Philosophical Arts, and Sciences."&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Society: [https://royalsociety.org/news/2011/Royal-Society-journal-archive-made-permanently-free-to-access/ Royal Society journal archive made permanently free to access], 26 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''academic journal'' applies to scholarly publications in all fields; this article discusses the aspects common to all academic field journals. [[Scientific journal]]s and journals of the [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] [[social sciences]] vary in form and function from journals of the [[humanities]] and [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] social sciences; their specific aspects are separately discussed.

The first academic journal was ''[[Journal des sçavans]]'' (January 1665), followed soon after by ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' (March 1665), and ''[[Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences]]'' (1666). The first fully [[peer-review]]ed journal was ''[[Medical Essays and Observations]]'' (1733&lt;!--Source says 1731 for the "launch", but it was published in 1733 --&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mudrak |first=Ben |title=Scholarly Publishing: A Brief History |url=https://www.aje.com/en/arc/scholarly-publishing-brief-history/ |publisher=American Journal Experts |access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of a published journal with the purpose of "[letting] people know what is happening in the [[Republic of Letters]]" was first conceived by [[Eudes de Mazerai]] in 1663. A publication titled ''Journal littéraire général'' was supposed to be published to fulfill that goal, but never was. [[Denis de Salo]], under the [[pseudonym]] "Sieur de Hédouville", took Mazerai's idea and obtained a [[royal privilege]] from [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]], granted to [[Jean Cusson (publisher)|Jean Cusson]] on 8 August 1664, to establish the ''[[Journal des sçavans]]''. The journal's first issue was published on 5 January 1665. It was aimed at [[Intellectual#"Man_of_letters"|people of letters]], and had four main objectives:&lt;ref name=JDS-history&gt;"[https://archive.org/details/indexjournaldess181658acaduoft Histoire du Journal des Savants]", p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;
#review newly published major European books,
#publish the [[obituary|obituaries]] of famous people, 
#report on discoveries in [[arts]] and [[science]], and
#report on the [[proceedings]] and [[censure]]s of both [[secular]] and [[ecclesiastical court]]s, as well as those of Universities both in France and outside.
Soon after, the [[Royal Society]] established [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] in March 1665, and the [[Académie des Sciences]] established the ''[[Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences]]'' in 1666, which more strongly focused on scientific communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Philosophical Transactions – The Secret History of the Scientific Journal |url=https://arts.st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophicaltransactions/brief-history-of-phil-trans/ |website=arts.st-andrews.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the [[18th century]], nearly 500 such periodical had been published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kronick |first1=David A. |title=A history of scientific and technical periodicals:the origins and development of the scientific and technological press, 1665-1790 |date=1962 |publisher=The Scarecrow Press |location=New York |chapter-url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31210000062164;view=1up;seq=76 |chapter=Original Publication: The Substantive Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; the vast majority coming from [[Germany]] (304 periodicals), [[France]] (53), and [[England]] (34). Several of those publications however, and in particular the German journals, tended to be short lived (under 5 years). A.J. Meadows has estimated the proliferation of journal to reach 10,000 journals in 1950, and 71,000 in 1987. However, Michael Mabe warns that the estimates will vary depending on the definition of what exactly counts as a scholarly publication, but that the growth rate has been "remarkably consistent over time", with an average rates of 3.46% per year from 1800 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mabe |first1=Michael |title=The growth and number of journals |journal=Serials: The Journal for the Serials Community |date=1 July 2003 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=191–197 |doi=10.1629/16191 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6db2/9a25afd79a3cea90c4bab129060676bd8710.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1733, ''[[Medical Essays and Observations]]'' was established by the [[Medical Society of Edinburgh]] as the first fully [[peer-review]]ed journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mudrak |first=Ben |title=Scholarly Publishing: A Brief History |url=https://www.aje.com/en/arc/scholarly-publishing-brief-history/ |publisher=American Journal Experts |access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer review was introduced as an attempt to increase the quality and pertinence of submissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Preface |journal=Medical Essays and Observations |date=1737 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=BLRTGMkfZIMC&amp;pg=PR1&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=T. and W. Ruddimans |edition=2nd |pages=v-xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important events in the history of academic journals include the establishment of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' (1869) and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' (1880), the establishment of ''[[Postmodern Culture]]'' in 1990 as the first [[online journal|online-only journal]], the foundation of [[arXiv]] in 1991 for the dissemination of [[preprint]]s to be discussed prior to publication in a journal, and the establishment of ''[[PLOS One]]'' in 2006 as the first [[megajournal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mudrak |first=Ben |title=Scholarly Publishing: A Brief History |url=https://www.aje.com/en/arc/scholarly-publishing-brief-history/ |publisher=American Journal Experts |access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly articles==

There are two kinds of [[manuscript|article or paper]] submissions in [[academia]]: solicited, where an individual has been invited to submit work either through direct contact or through a general submissions call, and unsolicited, where an individual submits a work for potential publication without directly being asked to do so.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon receipt of a submitted article, editors at the journal determine whether to reject the submission outright or begin the process of [[peer review]]. In the latter case, the submission becomes subject to review by outside scholars of the editor's choosing who typically remain anonymous. The number of these peer reviewers (or "referees") varies according to each journal's editorial practice – typically, no fewer than two, though sometimes three or more, experts in the subject matter of the article produce reports upon the content, style, and other factors, which inform the editors' publication decisions. Though these reports are generally confidential, some journals and publishers also practice [[public peer review]]. The editors either choose to reject the article, ask for a revision and resubmission, or accept the article for publication. Even accepted articles are often subjected to further (sometimes considerable) editing by journal editorial staff before they appear in print. The peer review can take from several weeks to several months.&lt;ref&gt;

==Reviewing==

===Review articles===
{{main|Review article}}
Review articles, also called "reviews of progress," are checks on the research published in journals. Some journals are devoted entirely to review articles, some contain a few in each issue, and others do not publish review articles. Such reviews often cover the research from the preceding year, some for longer or shorter terms; some are devoted to specific topics, some to general surveys. Some journals are [[enumeration|enumerative]], listing all significant articles in a given subject; others are selective, including only what they think worthwhile. Yet others are evaluative, judging the state of progress in the subject field.  Some journals are published in series, each covering a complete subject field year, or covering specific fields through several years. Unlike original research articles, review articles tend to be solicited submissions, sometimes planned years in advance. They are typically relied upon by students beginning a study in a given field, or for current awareness of those already in the field.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book reviews===
{{distinguish|Literary book review}}
Reviews of scholarly books are checks upon the research books published by scholars; unlike articles, book reviews tend to be solicited. Journals typically have a separate book review editor determining which new books to review and by whom. If an outside scholar accepts the book review editor's request for a book review, he or she generally receives a free copy of the book from the journal in exchange for a timely review. Publishers send books to book review editors in the hope that their books will be reviewed. The length and depth of research book reviews varies much from journal to journal, as does the extent of textbook and trade book review.&lt;ref&gt;

==Prestige and ranking==
{{main|Journal ranking}}

An [[academic]] journal's prestige is established over time, and can reflect many factors, some but not all of which are expressible quantitatively. In each [[academic discipline]], there are dominant journals that receive the largest number of submissions, and therefore can be selective in choosing their content. Yet, not only the largest journals are of excellent quality.&lt;ref name=DDD&gt;
{{cite book

 |title=Writing for Academic Journals
 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]]
 |edition=2nd |pages=42–45
 |isbn=978-0-335-23458-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[natural sciences]] and in the [[social sciences]], the [[impact factor]] is an established proxy, measuring the number of later articles citing articles already published in the journal. There are other quantitative measures of prestige, such as the overall number of citations, how quickly articles are cited, and the average "[[half-life]]" of articles. [[Clarivate Analytics]]' ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', which among other features, computes an [[impact factor]] for academic journals, draws data for computation from  the [[Science Citation Index Expanded]] (for natural science journals), and from the [[Social Sciences Citation Index]] (for social science journals).&lt;ref name=DDD /&gt; Several other metrics are also used, including the [[SCImago Journal Rank]], [[CiteScore]], [[Eigenfactor]], and [[Altmetrics]].

In the [[Anglosphere|Anglo-American]] [[humanities]], there is no tradition (as there is in the sciences) of giving impact-factors that could be used in establishing a journal's prestige. Recent moves have been made by the European Science Foundation (ESF) to change the situation, resulting in the publication of preliminary lists for the [[ranking]] of academic journals in the humanities.&lt;ref name=DDD /&gt; These rankings have been severely criticized, notably by history and sociology of science British journals that have published a common editorial entitled "Journals under Threat."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=2629173|year=2009|title=Journals under Threat: A Joint Response from History of Science, Technology and Medicine Editors|journal=Medical History|volume=53|issue=1|pages=1–4|pmid=19190746|doi=10.1017/s0025727300003288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it did not prevent ESF and some national organizations from proposing [[journal ranking]]s, it largely prevented their use as evaluation tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.3152/095820210X12809191250889|title=The controversial policies of journal ratings: Evaluating social sciences and humanities|journal=Research Evaluation|volume=19|issue=5|page=347|year=2010|last1=Pontille|first1=David|last2=Torny|first2=Didier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some disciplines such as [[knowledge management]]/[[intellectual capital]], the lack of a well-established journal ranking system is perceived by academics as "a major obstacle on the way to tenure, promotion and achievement recognition".&lt;ref name=CCC&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, a significant number of scientists and organizations consider the pursuit of [[impact factor]] calculations as inimical to the goals of science, and have signed the [[San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment]] to limit its use.

The categorization of journal prestige in some subjects has been attempted, typically using letters to rank their academic world importance.

Three categories of techniques have developed to assess journal quality and create journal rankings:&lt;ref&gt;

==Costs==
{{main|Academic publishing#Publishers and business aspects}}
{{see also|Scientific journal#Cost}}

Many academic journals are [[subsidy|subsidized]] by universities or professional organizations, and do not exist to make a profit. However, they often accept advertising, page and image charges from authors to pay for production costs. On the other hand, some journals are produced by commercial publishers who do make a profit by charging subscriptions to individuals and libraries. They may also sell all of their journals in discipline-specific collections or a variety of other packages.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom-2001&gt;
{{Cite journal

 |doi=10.1257/jep.15.4.183
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journal editors tend to have other professional responsibilities, most often as teaching professors. In the case of the largest journals, there are paid staff assisting in the editing. The production of the journals is almost always done by publisher-paid staff. Humanities and social science academic journals are usually subsidized by universities or professional organization.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New developments==
The [[Internet]] has revolutionized the production of, and access to, academic journals, with their contents available online via services subscribed to by [[Academic library|academic libraries]]. Individual articles are subject-indexed in databases such as [[Google Scholar]]. Some of the smallest, most specialized journals are prepared in-house, by an academic department, and published only online – such form of publication has sometimes been in the blog format. Currently, there is a movement in higher education encouraging [[open access]], either via [[self-archiving|self archiving]], whereby the author deposits a paper in a [[disciplinary repository|disciplinary]] or [[institutional repository]] where it can be searched for and read, or via publishing it in a free [[open access journal]], which does not charge for [[subscription business model|subscriptions]], being either subsidized or financed by a [[article processing charge|publication fee]]. Given the goal of sharing scientific research to speed advances, open access has affected science journals more than humanities journals.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Commercial publishers are experimenting with open access models, but are trying to protect their subscription revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=James Hendler|year=2007|title=Reinventing Academic Publishing-Part 1|journal=[[IEEE Intelligent Systems]]|volume=22|issue=5|pages=2–3|doi=10.1109/MIS.2007.4338485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The much lower entry cost of on-line publishing has also raised concerns of an increase in [[predatory open-access publishing|publication of "junk" journals]] with lower publishing standards. These journals, often with names chosen as similar to well-established publications, solicit articles via e-mail and then charge the author to publish an article, often with [[Who's Afraid of Peer Review?|no sign of actual review]]. [[Jeffrey Beall]], a research librarian at the [[University of Colorado]], has compiled a list of what he considers to be "potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers"; the list numbered over 300 journals as of April 2013, but he estimates that there may be thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/08/health/for-scientists-an-exploding-world-of-pseudo-academia.html|title=Scientific Articles Accepted (Personal Checks, Too)|last=Kolata|first=Gina|date=April 7, 2013|work=New York Times|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[OMICS Publishing Group]], which publishes a number of the journals on this list, has [[OMICS Publishing Group#Legal threat to Jeffrey Beall|threatened to sue Beall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-08-29/medical-journals-have-a-fake-news-problem|title=Medical journals have a fake news problem|last=Deprez|first=Esme|date=August 29, 2017|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academic journals use the [[registered report]] format, which aims to counteract issues such as [[data dredging]] and hypothesizing after the results are known. For example, ''[[Nature Human Behaviour]]'' has adopted the registered report format, as it "shift[s] the emphasis from the results of research to the questions that guide the research and the methods used to answer them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Promoting reproducibility with registered reports|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|date=10 January 2017|volume=1|issue=1|pages=0034|doi=10.1038/s41562-016-0034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[European Journal of Personality]]'' defines this format: "In a registered report, authors create a study proposal that includes theoretical and empirical background, research questions/hypotheses, and pilot data (if available). Upon submission, this proposal will then be reviewed prior to data collection, and if accepted, the paper resulting from this peer-reviewed procedure will be published, regardless of the study outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Streamlined review and registered reports soon to be official at EJP|url=https://www.ejp-blog.com/blog/2017/2/3/streamlined-review-and-registered-reports-coming-soon|website=THE EJP BLOG|publisher=European Journal of Personality|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lists of Academic Journals ==
Wikipedia has many [[Lists of academic journals|Lists of Academic Journals]] by discipline, such as [[List of African studies journals|List of African Studies Journals]] and [[List of forestry journals|List of Forestry Journals]]. The largest database providing detailed information about journals is [[Ulrich's Periodicals Directory|Ulrichs Global Serials Directory]]. Other databases providing detailed information about journals are the Modern Language Association Directory of Periodicals and [[Genamics JournalSeek]]. Journal hosting websites like [[Project MUSE]], [[JSTOR]], [[PubMed|Pubmed]], I[[Web of Science|ngenta Web of Science]], and [[Informaworld]] also provide journal lists. Some sites evaluate journals, providing information on such things as how long the journal takes to review articles and what types of articles they want.&lt;ref&gt;For example the [https://journalreviews.princeton.edu/ Reviews of Peer-Reviewed Journals in the Humanities and Social Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ball State '''Center for Energy Research/Education/Service (CERES)''' is an interdisciplinary academic support unit at [[Ball State University]] focused on enhancing research and education on issues of energy usage and conservation. The center was established in 1982 as an addition to the existing [[Ball State University College of Architecture and Planning|College of Architecture and Planning]]. The center currently states the following as its mission: "To maintain ongoing programs for the examination of state-of-the-art energy conservation and end-use practices; To investigate alternative solutions to contemporary energy problems; To develop projections and implications of the results of these solutions; To devise means of implementing these ideas; To disseminate findings to the appropriate publics—professionals, educators, policy planners, students and laypersons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CERES, Center for Energy Research/Education/Service|url=http://cms.bsu.edu/academics/centersandinstitutes/ceres|accessdate=April 5, 2018|website=[[Ball State University|BSU.edu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Concerns about environmentalism and conservation became popularized in the 1970s following the successes of the inaugural [[Earth Day]] that allowed for a sort of fusion between radical counterculture ideas regarding environmentalism and more mainstream ideas presented by politicians such as [[Gaylord Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Adam|last=Rome|author-link=Adam Rome|date=2013|title=The Genius of Earth Day: How a 1970 Teach-In Unexpectedly Made the First Green Generation|location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Hill and Wang]]|isbn=9780809040506}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, energy crises, such as the [[1973 Oil Crisis]] and the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] caused concern about the way contemporary energy sources were being utilized, prompting some to begin research in alternative forms of energy or better forms of energy conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Gottlieb|date=2005|title=Forcing the Spring: The Transformation of the American Environmental Movement|location=[[Washington DC]]|publisher=[[Island Press]]|isbn=1559638052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hal K.|last=Rothman|author-link=Hal Rothman|date=1998|title=The Greening of a Nation? Environmentalism in the United States Since 1945|location=[[Fort Worth, Texas|Forth Worth]]|publisher=[[Harcourt Brace College Publishers]]|isbn=0155028553}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Ball State University started their efforts to implement energy education into the college; in 1979, with funding from the [[Indiana General Assembly]], the university began planning of the Center for Energy Research/Education/Service, with construction beginning in the summer of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|first=Michael|last=Beattie|title=CERES: The Facility|url=http://libx.bsu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/CERESPubs/id/499/rec/30|publisher=Ball State University Center for Energy Research/Education/Service|accessdate=April 5, 2018|location=[[Muncie, Indiana]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, [[Ball State University]] began planning for incorporating this sort of education about conservation and energy education into their curriculum, including proposed courses in environmental architecture and in utilizing [[solar energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Designing the Future: Comprehensive Planning for Energy Education and Research Group|date=November 1980|publisher=[[Ball State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, CERES was completed and opened for usage for Ball State's campus. 

Since its inception in Ball State's campus, CERES has served as a means to incorporate energy education into Ball State's campus. By 1986, even, this had become one of its missions, with the Center becoming focused on placing Ball State as a leader in reaching a "sustainable future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Continued Implementation of a Sustainable Future: The 86/87 Plan|date=December 2, 1985|publisher=Ball State University Center for Energy Research/Education/Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center also had national significance; from the period between 1985 and 1988, CERES was one of only five test laboratories accredited by the Solar Rating and Certification Corporation for their solar research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=A Ten-Year Synopsis|publisher=Ball State University Center for Energy Research/Education/Service|date=1992|accessdate=April 5, 2018|url=http://libx.bsu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/CERESPubs/id/115/rec/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going forward, the center has remained an integral part of energy and conservation research and education, both on Ball State's campus and in the greater [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]] community.

'''Blanche Marchesi''' (4 April 1863 – 15 December 1940) was a [[France|French]] [[mezzo-soprano]] and voice teacher best known for her interpretations of the works of [[Richard Wagner]]. She was the daughter of [[Mathilde Marchesi|Mathilde Graumann Marchesi]], a German voice instructor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Mi Contra Fa: The Immoralisings of a Machiavellian Musician |last= Sorabji |first= Kaikhosru Shapurji|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1986 |publisher= Da Capo Press |location= |isbn= |page= 133 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who taught a variety of well-known [[opera]] singers, including [[Emma Eames]], [[Nellie Melba]], and [[Emma Calvé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1899/01/26/archives/music-heard-yesterday-miss-blanche-marchesis-first-song-recital-at.html |title= Music Heard Yesterday.; Miss Blanche Marchesi's First Song Recital at Mendelssohn Hall.  |accessdate=2009-01-28 |last= |first= |vauthors= |date= 1899-01-26 |work= New York Times |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Marchesi was born in [[Paris]] in February 1863. For her education, she attended boarding schools in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] and then [[Paris]].
Although she initially was educated as a [[violin]]ist, she decided to pursue a [[singing]] career in 1881. Her first concert was held at [[Queen's Hall]] in 1896.&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;{{cite book |title= My Life of Music |last= Wood |first= Joseph Henry |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1871  |publisher= Ayer Publishing |location= |isbn= 0-8369-5820-9 |page= 148 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opera critics at the time criticized her technical skill but praised her interpretive ability. During her career as a voice teacher, Marchesi instructed such singers as [[United Kingdom|British]] [[contralto]]s [[Muriel Brunskill]] and [[Astra Desmond]].&lt;ref name="wood"/&gt; She premiered a work of [[Cecile Chaminade]] in [[England]] in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=NAXOS&gt;{{cite web|last=Summers|first=Jonathan|title=CECILE CHAMINADE|url=http://www.naxos.com/person/Cecile_Chaminade_25943/25943.htm|work=NAXOS|publisher=NAXos|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Shaw's song "Heffle Cuckoo Fair" is dedicated to her. She held a farewell concert in 1938, two years before her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |vauthors= |year= 1973 |month= |title= Blanche Marchesi |journal= Opera News |volume= 37 |issue= 19 |pages= |id= |url= |quote= Blanche Marchesi gave her farewell concert in 1938, aged seventy-five...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Marchesi had two sisters, Therése and Stella. Her parents were Mathilde Graumann Marchesi of Frankfurt and Salvatore De Castrone (Marchese di Palermo, hence the stage name Marchesi), who was also an opera singer and a voice instructor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Melba: a Biography |last= Hetherington|first= John Aikman |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1967 |publisher= Faber &amp; Faber |location= |isbn= |page= 62 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved as a key figure in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|Italian Revolution of 1848]] where he initiated the uprising at the Palazzo Raimondi in Milan. She was first married to Baron Alexander Popper von Podhragy, Vienna, with whom she had 3 sons. Leopold, Fritz and Ernst. Leopold was declared enemy of the state by the Nazis and the Democratic Republic of Austria and expropriated. Fritz was killed by Austrian Nazis in 1948 in Austria. Ernst was deported to Dachau, freed and fled to the United States of America. Baron André Anzon Caccamisi,London, was her second husband as of 1894 with whom she had one son, Baron Jerome Anzon-Caccamisi, who was murdered by the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] in February 1945 as a Resistance and French intelligence officer in the  [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] in Austria.

{{Infobox medical condition|Name=Developmental Disability |ICD9= |MeshID=D002658
| Field        = [[Psychiatry]] }}
'''Developmental disability''' is a diverse group of chronic conditions that are due to mental or physical impairments that arise before adulthood. Developmental disabilities cause individuals living with them many difficulties in certain areas of life, especially in "language, mobility, learning, self-help, and independent living".&lt;ref name =cdc&gt;Center for Disease Control and Prevention. (2013). [https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/dd Developmental disabilities.] Retrieved October 18, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Developmental disabilities can be detected early on and persist throughout an individual's lifespan. Developmental disability that affects all areas of a child's development is sometimes referred to as [[global developmental delay]].

Most common developmental disabilities:

* [[Down syndrome]] is a condition in which people are born with an extra copy of chromosome 21. Normally, a person is born with two copies of chromosome 21. However, if they are born with Down syndrome, they have an extra copy of this chromosome. This extra copy affects the development of the body and brain, causing physical and mental challenges for the individual.
* [[Fragile X syndrome]] (FXS) is thought to cause [[autism]] and intellectual disability, usually among boys. 
* [[Pervasive developmental disorders]] (PDD) are a group of developmental disabilities that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges.  
* [[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder|Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders]] (FASD) are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. 
* [[Cerebral palsy]] (CP) is a group of disorders that affect a person’s ability to move and maintain balance and posture. CP is the most common motor disability in childhood.&lt;ref name =cdc/&gt;
* [[Intellectual disability]], also (sometimes proscriptively) known as mental retardation,&lt;!--see talk page: there is currently consensus to mention this synonym but need to distinguish it from general DD--&gt; is defined as an IQ below 70 along with limitations in adaptive functioning and onset before the age of 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;DSM-IV - Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision, published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The causes of developmental disabilities are varied and remain unknown in a large proportion of cases. Even in cases of known etiology the line between "cause" and "effect" is not always clear, leading to difficulty in categorizing causes.&lt;ref&gt;Improving health outcomes for children and youth with developmental disabilities, A literature review/Surrey Place Services 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic factors have long been implicated in the causation of developmental disabilities. There is also a large environmental component to these conditions, and the relative contributions of [[nature versus nurture]] have been debated for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Finucane, B.(2012) Introduction to special issue on developmental disabilities. National Society of Genetic Counselors, Inc. 749-751.&lt;/ref&gt;

Current theories on causation focus on genetic factors, and over 1,000 known genetic conditions include developmental disabilities as a symptom.&lt;ref&gt;OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) (2012). Retrieved October 2013 from http://www.omim.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Developmental disabilities affect between 1 and 2% of the population in most western countries, although many government sources acknowledge that statistics are flawed in this area. The worldwide proportion of people with developmental disabilities is believed to be approximately 1.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inclusion-international.org/en/|title=Enable, Scotland -|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is twice as common in males as in females, and some researchers have found that the prevalence of mild developmental disabilities is likely to be higher in areas of poverty and deprivation, and among people of certain ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm50/5086/5086.htm |title=Valuing People&amp;nbsp;— A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century |page=16 |publisher=Secretary of State (UK) for Health |date=March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis and quantification==
Developmental disabilities can be initially suspected when a child does not reach expected [[child development stages]]. Subsequently, a [[differential diagnosis]] may be used to diagnose an underlying disease, which may include a [[physical examination]] and [[genetic test]]s.

The degree of disability can be quantified by assigning a ''developmental age'' to a person, which is age of the group into which test scores place the person. This, in turn, can be used to calculate a ''{{visible anchor|developmental quotient}}'' (DQ) as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/developmental%20quotient |title=Definition of DEVELOPMENTAL QUOTIENT |website=[[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary |publisher= |accessdate=2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/developmental+quotient |title=developmental quotient (DQ) |publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]] |accessdate=2014-11-09}}, in turn citing Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; DQ = \frac{Developmental\ age}{Chronological\ age} * 100 &lt;/math&gt;

==Associated issues==

===Physical health issues===
There are many physical [[health]] factors associated with developmental disabilities. For some specific syndromes and diagnoses, these are inherent, such as poor heart function in people with Down syndrome. People with severe [[communication]] difficulties find it difficult to articulate their health needs, and without adequate support and education might not recognize [[illness|ill health]]. [[Epilepsy]], sensory problems (such as poor [[visual perception|vision]] and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]]), [[obesity]] and poor [[oral hygiene|dental health]] are over-represented in this population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intellectualdisability.info/mental_phys_health/health_guide_adlt.htm |title=Health Guidelines for Adults with an Intellectual Disability |publisher=St. George's University of London/Down's Syndrome Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Life expectancy]] among people with developmental disabilities as a group is estimated at 20 years below average, although this is improving with advancements in adaptive and medical technologies, and as people are leading healthier, more fulfilling lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nswcid.org.au/systemic/position/health.html |title=Health and People with Intellectual Disability |publisher=NSW Council for Intellectual Disability}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some conditions (such as [[Freeman-Sheldon syndrome]]) do not impact life expectancy.

===Mental health issues (dual diagnoses)===
[[Mental health]] issues, and [[mental illness|psychiatric illnesses]], are more likely to occur in people with developmental disabilities than in the general population. A number of factors are attributed to the high incidence rate of dual diagnoses:
* The high likelihood of encountering [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] events throughout their lifetime (such as abandonment by loved ones, [[abuse]], [[bullying]] and [[harassment]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martorell|first=A.|author2=Tsakanikos E.|title=Traumatic experiences and life events in people with intellectual disability|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|year=2008|volume=21|issue=5|pages=445–448|doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e328305e60e|pmid=18650684|url=http://journals.lww.com/co-psychiatry/Abstract/2008/09000/Traumatic_experiences_and_life_events_in_people.4.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The social and developmental restrictions placed upon people with developmental disabilities (such as lack of [[education]], [[poverty]], limited [[employment]] opportunities, limited opportunities for fulfilling relationships, boredom)
* Biological factors (such as brain injury, [[epilepsy]], illicit and prescribed drug and alcohol misuse)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chaplin|first=E. |author2=Gilvarry, C. |author3=Tsakanikos E.|title=Recreational substance use patterns in adults with intellectual disability and co-morbid psychopathology|journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities|year=2011|volume=32|issue=6|pages=2981–6|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2011.05.002|pmid=21640553|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891422211001612}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Developmental factors (such as lack of understanding of [[social norms]] and appropriate behavior, inability of those around to allow/understand expressions of grief and other human [[emotions]])
* External monitoring factor: all people with developmental disabilities that are in a federal- or state-funded residence require the resident to have some form of behavioral monitoring for each person with developmental disability at the residence. With this information psychological diagnoses are more easily given than with the general population that has less consistent monitoring.
* Access to health care providers: in the United States, all people with developmental disabilities that are in a federal- or state-funded residence require the residence to have annual visits to various health care providers. With consistent visits to health care providers more people with developmental disabilities are likely to receive appropriate treatment than the general population that is not required to visit various health care providers.

These problems are exacerbated by difficulties in diagnosis of mental health issues, and in appropriate treatment and medication, as for physical health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mind.org.uk/Information/Factsheets/Learning+disabilities/#Mental_health_problems|title=Learning Disabilities: Mental Health Problems |publisher=Mind (UK National Association for Mental Health)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intellectualdisability.info/mental_phys_health/classification_ac.html |title=CLASSIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN ADULTS WITH LEARNING [INTELLECTUAL] DISABILITIES |author=Sally-Ann Cooper |publisher=St. George's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse and vulnerability===
[[Abuse]] is a significant issue for people with developmental disabilities, and as a group they are regarded as [[vulnerability|vulnerable]] people in most jurisdictions. Common types of abuse include:
* [[Physical abuse]] (withholding food, hitting, punching, pushing, etc.)
* [[Neglect]] (withholding help when required, e.g., assistance with personal hygiene)
* [[Sexual abuse]] is associated with psychological disturbance. Sequeira, Howlin &amp; Hollins found that sexual abuse was associated with increased rates of mental illness and behavioural problems, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Psychological reactions to abuse were similar to those observed in the general population, but with the addition of stereotypical behaviour. The more serious the abuse, the more severe the symptoms that were reported.&lt;ref&gt;Psychological disturbance associated with sexual abuse in people with learning disabilities. Case-control study. / Sequeira, H; Howlin, P; Hollins, S.In: British Journal of Psychiatry, Vol. 183, No. NOV., 11.2003, p. 451–456.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/bjprcpsych/183/5/451.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Psychological or [[emotional abuse]] ([[verbal abuse]], [[shaming]] and belittling)
* Constraint and restrictive practices (turning off an electric wheelchair so a person cannot move)
* [[Financial abuse]] (charging unnecessary fees, holding onto pensions, wages, etc.)
* [[Legal abuse|Legal]] or civil abuse (restricted access to services)
* Systemic abuse (denied access to an appropriate service due to perceived support needs)
* Passive neglect (a caregiver's failure to provide adequate food, shelter)
Lack of education, lack of [[self-esteem]] and self-advocacy skills, lack of understanding of [[social norms]] and appropriate behavior and communication difficulties are strong contributing factors to the high incidence of abuse among this population.

In addition to abuse from people in positions of power, [[peer abuse]] is recognized as a significant, if misunderstood, problem. Rates of criminal offense among people with developmental disabilities are also disproportionately high, and it is widely acknowledged that criminal justice systems throughout the world are ill-equipped for the needs of people with developmental disabilities—as both perpetrators and victims of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thearc.org/faqs/sexualabuse.doc |title=Sexual Abuse FAQ |format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ncfv-cnivf/publications/fvmentalhandicap-eng.php |title=Family Violence and People with a Mental Handicap |publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada |work=National Clearinghouse on Family Violence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thearc.org/faqs/crimjustice.doc |title=Criminal Justice FAQ |publisher=The Arc of the United States |format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Failings in care have been identified in one in eight deaths of people with learning difficulties under NHS England.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44001170 Failings in learning disability deaths, report finds] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenging behavior===
{{Main|Challenging behaviour}}
Some people with developmental disabilities exhibit challenging behavior, defined as "culturally abnormal behaviour(s) of such intensity, frequency or duration that the physical safety of the person or others is placed in serious jeopardy, or behaviour which is likely to seriously limit or deny access to the use of ordinary community facilities".&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, E. 1995. ''Challenging behaviour: analysis and intervention with people with learning difficulties''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Common types of challenging behavior include self-injurious behavior (such as hitting, headbutting, biting), aggressive behavior (such as hitting others, shouting, screaming, spitting, kicking, swearing, hairpulling), inappropriate sexualized behavior (such as public masturbation or groping), behavior directed at property (such as throwing objects and stealing) and stereotyped behaviors (such as repetitive rocking, [[echolalia]] or elective incontinence). Such behaviors can be assessed to suggest areas of further improvement, using assessment tools such as the [[Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (NCBRF)]].

Challenging behavior in people with developmental disabilities may be caused by a number of factors, including biological (pain, medication, the need for sensory stimulation), social (boredom, seeking social interaction, the need for an element of control, lack of knowledge of community norms, insensitivity of staff and services to the person's wishes and needs), environmental (physical aspects such as noise and lighting, or gaining access to preferred objects or activities), psychological (feeling excluded, lonely, devalued, labelled, disempowered, living up to people's negative expectations) or simply a means of communication. A lot of the time, challenging behavior is learned and brings rewards and it is very often possible to teach people new behaviors to achieve the same aims. Challenging behavior in people with developmental disabilities can often be associated with specific mental health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hemmings|first=C. |author2=Underwood, L. |author3=Tsakanikos E. |author4=Holt, G. |author5=Bouras, N. |title=Clinical predictors of challenging behaviour in intellectual disability|journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology|year=2008|volume=43|issue=10|pages=824–830|doi=10.1007/s00127-008-0370-9|pmid=18488127|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/v18g5123g4gw6326/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experience and research suggests that what professionals call "challenging behavior" is often a reaction to the challenging environments that those providing services create around people with developmental disabilities. "Challenging behavior" in this context is a method of communicating dissatisfaction with the failure of those providing services to focus on what kind of life makes most sense to the person, and is often the only recourse a developmentally disabled person has against unsatisfactory services or treatment and the lack of opportunities made available to the person. This is especially the case where the services deliver lifestyles and ways of working that are centered on what suits the service provider and its staff, rather than what best suits the person.

In general, behavioral interventions or what has been termed [[applied behavior analysis]] has been found to be effective in reducing specific challenging behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neef|first= N. A. |year=2001 |title=The Past and Future of Behavior Analysis in Developmental Disabilities: When Good News is Bad and Bad News is Good. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 2 (4) ' |pages=336–343|url= http://www.baojournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, efforts have been placed on developing a developmental pathway model in the behavior analysis literature to prevent challenging behavior from occurring.&lt;ref&gt;Roane, H.S., Ringdahl, J.E., Vollmer, T.R.,  Whitmarsh, E.L. and  Marcus, B.A. (2007).  A Preliminary Description of the Occurrence of Proto-injurious Behavior in Typically Developing Children. ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention, 3(4),'' 334-347. [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal attitudes==
Throughout history, people with developmental disabilities have been viewed as incapable and incompetent in their capacity for decision-making and development. Until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe, care and asylum was provided by families and the Church (in monasteries and other religious communities), focusing on the provision of [[Maslow's hierarchy|basic physical needs]] such as food, shelter and clothing. Stereotypes such as the dimwitted [[village idiot]],  and potentially harmful characterizations (such as [[demonic possession]] for people with epilepsy) were prominent in social attitudes of the time.

Early in the twentieth century, the [[eugenics]] movement became popular throughout the world. This led to the [[forced sterilization]] and prohibition of marriage in most of the developed world and was later used by [[Hitler]] as rationale for the mass murder of mentally challenged individuals during the [[Holocaust]]. The eugenics movement was later thought to be seriously flawed and in violation of human rights and the practice of forced sterilization and prohibition from marriage was discontinued by most of the developed world by the mid 20th century.

The movement towards individualism in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the opportunities afforded by the [[Industrial Revolution]], led to housing and care using the asylum model. People were placed by, or removed from, their families (usually in infancy) and housed in large institutions (of up to 3,000 people, although some institutions were home to many more, such as the [[Philadelphia State Hospital]] in Pennsylvania which housed 7,000 people through the 1960s), many of which were self-sufficient through the labor of the residents. Some of these institutions provided a very basic level of education (such as differentiation between colors and basic word recognition and numeracy), but most continued to focus solely on the provision of basic needs. Conditions in such institutions varied widely, but the support provided was generally non-individualized, with aberrant behavior and low levels of economic productivity regarded as a burden to society. Heavy tranquilization and assembly line methods of support (such as "birdfeeding" and cattle herding){{clarify|date=November 2015}} were the norm, and the [[medical model of disability]] prevailed. Services were provided based on the relative ease to the provider, not based on the human needs of the individual.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Ignoring the prevailing attitude, [[Civitan International|Civitans]] adopted service to the developmentally disabled as a major organizational emphasis in 1952. Their earliest efforts included workshops for special education teachers and daycamps for disabled children, all at a time when such training and programs were almost nonexistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Armbrester |first=Margaret E. |title=The Civitan Story |year=1992 |publisher=Ebsco Media |location=Birmingham, AL |pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the segregation of people with developmental disabilities wasn't widely questioned by academics or policy-makers until the 1969 publication of [[Wolf Wolfensberger]]'s seminal work "The Origin and Nature of Our Institutional Models",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Wolf Wolfensberger |title=The Origin and Nature of Our Institutional Models |url=http://www.disabilitymuseum.org/lib/docs/1909.htm?page=print |date=January 10, 1969 |publisher=President's Committee on Mental Retardation, Washington, D.C. |work=Changing Patterns in Residential Services for the Mentally Retarded}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on some of the ideas proposed by SG Howe 100 years earlier. This book posited that society characterizes people with disabilities as [[deviant]], sub-human and burdens of charity, resulting in the adoption of that "deviant" role. Wolfensberger argued that this dehumanization, and the segregated institutions that result from it, ignored the potential productive contributions that all people can make to society. He pushed for a shift in policy and practice that recognized the human needs of "retardates" and provided the same basic human rights as for the rest of the population.

The publication of this book may be regarded as the first move towards the widespread adoption of the [[social model of disability]] in regard to these types of disabilities, and was the impetus for the development of government strategies for desegregation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}Successful [[lawsuit]]s against governments and an increasing awareness of human rights and self-advocacy also contributed to this process, resulting in the passing in the U.S. of the [[Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act]] in 1980.

From the 1960s to the present, most U.S. states have moved towards the elimination of segregated institutions. Along with the work of Wolfensberger and others including Gunnar and Rosemary Dybwad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.disabilitymuseum.org/beyond-affliction/ba_shows.dir/revoluti.dir/highlights/subject/ng0002tx.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711075247/http://www.disabilitymuseum.org/beyond-affliction/ba_shows.dir/revoluti.dir/highlights/subject/ng0002tx.html |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of scandalous revelations around the horrific conditions within state institutions created public outrage that led to change to a more community-based method of providing services.&lt;ref name=arcmass&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arcmass.org/StateHousePolicy/RegulationandPolicyDebates/FernaldSchoolClosingandRICCIClass/FernaldNews/WhyTheFernaldCenterShouldClose/ChristmasinPurgatoryWillowbrook/tabid/692/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711170039/http://www.arcmass.org/StateHousePolicy/RegulationandPolicyDebates/FernaldSchoolClosingandRICCIClass/FernaldNews/WhyTheFernaldCenterShouldClose/ChristmasinPurgatoryWillowbrook/tabid/692/Default.aspx |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the mid-1970s, most governments had committed to de-institutionalization, and had started preparing for the wholesale movement of people into the general community, in line with the principles of [[normalisation (people with disabilities)|normalization]]. In most countries, this was essentially complete by the late 1990s, although the debate over whether or not to close institutions persists in some states, including Massachusetts.&lt;ref name = arcmass/&gt;

Individuals with developmental disabilities are not fully integrated into society.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Person Centered Planning and Person Centered Approaches are seen as methods of addressing the continued labeling and exclusion of socially devalued people, such as people with a developmental disability label, encouraging a focus on the person as someone with capacities and gifts, as well as support needs.

==Services and support==
Today, support services are provided by government agencies, [[non-governmental organizations]] and by [[private sector]] providers. Support services address most aspects of life for people with developmental disabilities, and are usually theoretically based in community inclusion, using concepts such as [[social role valorization]] and increased self-determination (using models such as [[Person Centred Planning]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kormann &amp; Petronko|year=2003|title= Crisis and Revolution in Developmental Disabilities: The Dilemma of Community Based Services. ''The Behavior Analyst Today,  3 (4,'' |pages=434–443 |url=http://www.baojournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support services are funded through government block funding (paid directly to service providers by the government), through individualized funding packages (paid directly to the individual by the government, specifically for the purchase of services) or privately by the individual (although they may receive certain subsidies or discounts, paid by the government). There also are a number of non-profit agencies dedicated to enriching the lives of people living with developmental disabilities and erasing the barriers they have to being included in their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.JARC.org|title=Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and training===
{{Main|Special education}}
Education and training opportunities for people with developmental disabilities have expanded greatly in recent times, with many governments mandating universal access to educational facilities, and more students moving out of [[special school]]s and into [[mainstreaming in education|mainstream]] classrooms with support.

[[Post-secondary education]] and [[vocational education|vocational training]] is also increasing for people with these types of disabilities, although many programs offer only segregated "access" courses in areas such as [[literacy]], [[numeracy]] and other basic skills. Legislation (such as the UK's [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]]) requires educational institutions and training providers to make "reasonable adjustments" to curriculum and teaching methods in order to accommodate the learning needs of students with disabilities, wherever possible. There are also some vocational training centers that cater specifically to people with disabilities, providing the skills necessary to work in integrated settings, one of the largest being [[Dale Rogers Training Center]] in [[Oklahoma City]]. (See also [[Intensive interaction]])

===At-home and community support===
Many people with developmental disabilities live in the general community, either with family members, in supervised-group homes or in their own homes (that they rent or own, living alone or with [[flatmate]]s). At-home and community supports range from one-to-one assistance from a support worker with identified aspects of daily living (such as [[budgeting]], [[shopping]] or paying bills) to full 24-hour support (including assistance with household tasks, such as [[cooking]] and [[Housekeeping|cleaning]], and personal care such as showering, dressing and the administration of medication). The need for full 24-hour support is usually associated with difficulties recognizing safety issues (such as responding to a fire or using a telephone) or for people with potentially dangerous medical conditions (such as asthma or diabetes) who are unable to manage their conditions without assistance.

In the [[United States]], a support worker is known as a [[Direct Support Professional]] (DSP). The DSP works in assisting the individual with their ADLs and also acts as an [[advocate]] for the individual with a developmental disability, in communicating their needs, self-expression and [[objective (goal)|goals]].

Supports of this type also include assistance to identify and undertake new hobbies or to access community services (such as education), learning appropriate behavior or recognition of community norms, or with relationships and expanding circles of friends. Most programs offering at-home and community support are designed with the goal of increasing the individual's independence, although it is recognized that people with more severe disabilities may never be able to achieve full independence in some areas of daily life.

===Residential accommodation===

Some people with developmental disabilities live in residential accommodation (also known as '''group homes''') with other people with similar assessed needs. These homes are usually staffed around the clock, and usually house between 3 and 15 residents. The prevalence of this type of support is gradually decreasing, however, as residential accommodation is replaced by at-home and community support, which can offer increased choice and self-determination for individuals. Some U.S. states still provide institutional care, such as the [[Texas State Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dads.state.tx.us/services/stateschools/index.html Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206001450/http://www.dads.state.tx.us/services/stateschools/index.html |date=February 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of residential accommodation is usually determined by the level of developmental disability and mental health needs.&lt;ref&gt;Chaplin, E., Paschos, D. O’Hara, J., McCarthy, J., Holt, G.Bouras, N. Tsakanikos E. (2010). Mental ill-health and care pathways in adults with intellectual disability across different residential settings. Research in Developmental Disabilities, 31, 458-63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment support===
Employment support usually consists of two types of support:
* Support to access or participate in integrated employment, in a workplace in the general community. This may include specific programs to increase the skills needed for successful employment (work preparation), one-to-one or small group support for on-the-job training, or one-to-one or small group support after a transition period (such as advocacy when dealing with an employer or a bullying colleague, or assistance to complete an application for a promotion).
* The provision of specific employment opportunities within segregated '''business services'''. Although these are designed as "transitional" services (teaching work skills needed to move into integrated employment), many people remain in such services for the duration of their working life. The types of work performed in business services include mailing and packaging services, cleaning, gardening and landscaping, timberwork, metal fabrication, farming and sewing.

Workers with developmental disabilities have historically been paid less for their labor than those in the general workforce, although this is gradually changing with government initiatives, the enforcement of anti-discrimination legislation and changes in perceptions of capability in the general community.

In the United States, a variety of initiatives have been launched in the past decade to reduce unemployment among workers with disabilities—estimated by researchers at over 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Richard Burkhauser |author2=Mary Daly |title=United States Disability Policy in a Changing Environment |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives  |volume=16 |issue=1 |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these initiatives are directed at employment in mainstream businesses. They include heightened placement efforts by the community agencies serving people with developmental disabilities, as well as by government agencies.

Additionally, state-level initiatives are being launched to increase employment among workers with disabilities. In California, the state senate in 2009 created the Senate Select Committee on Autism and Related Disorders. The Committee has been examining additions to existing community employment services, and also new employment approaches. Committee member Lou Vismara, chairman of the MIND Institute at [[University of California, Davis]], is pursuing the development of a planned community for persons with autism and related disorders in the [[Sacramento]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.disabilityrightsca.org/news/Sacramento_Bee-2009-09-18.htm |title=With Housing that Caters to All, We all Win |publisher=Sacramento Bee |date=2008-09-18 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another committee member, [[Michael S. Bernick|Michael Bernick]], the former director of the state labor department, has established a program at the California state university system, starting at [[California State University East Bay]], to support students with autism on the college level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/08/04/EDPN193F67.DTL |title=College for Autistics |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Committee efforts include mutual support employment efforts, such as disability job networks, job boards, and identifying business lines that build on the strengths of persons with disabilities.

===Day services===
Non-vocational day services are usually known as '''day centers''', and are traditionally segregated services offering training in life skills (such as meal preparation and basic literacy), center-based activities (such as crafts, games and music classes) and external activities (such as day trips). Some more progressive day centers also support people to access vocational training opportunities (such as college courses), and offer individualized outreach services (planning and undertaking activities with the individual, with support offered one-to-one or in small groups).

Traditional day centers were based on the principles of [[occupational therapy]], and were created as [[respite care|respite]] for family members caring for their loved ones with disabilities. This is slowly changing, however, as programs offered become more skills-based and focused on increasing independence.

===Advocacy===
[[Advocacy]] is a burgeoning support field for people with developmental disabilities. Advocacy groups now exist in most jurisdictions, working collaboratively with people with disabilities for systemic change (such as changes in policy and legislation) and for changes for individuals (such as claiming welfare benefits or when responding to abuse). Most advocacy groups also work to support people, throughout the world, to increase their capacity for [[self-advocacy]], teaching the skills necessary for people to advocate for their own needs.

===Other types of support===
Other types of support for people with developmental disabilities may include:
* therapeutic services, such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, massage, aromatherapy, art, dance/movement or music therapy
* supported holidays
* short-stay respite services (for people who live with family members or other unpaid carers)
* transport services, such as dial-a-ride or free bus passes
* specialist behavior support services, such as high-security services for people with high-level, high-risk challenging behaviors
* specialist relationships and sex education

Programs are set up around the country in hopes to educate individuals with and without developmental disabilities. Studies have been done testing specific scenarios on how what is the most beneficial way to educate people. Interventions are a great way to educate people, but also the most time consuming. With the busy schedules that everybody has, it is found to be difficult to go about the intervention approach. Another scenario that was found to be not as beneficial, but more realistic in the time sense was Psychoeducational approach. They focus on informing people on what abuse is, how to spot abuse, and what to do when spotted. Individuals with developmental disabilities don't only need the support programs to keep them safe, but everybody in society needs to be aware of what is happening and how to help everybody prosper.&lt;ref&gt;Lund, Emily, and Marilyn Hammond. “Single-Session Intervention for Abuse Awareness Among
People with Developmental Disabilities.” Sexuality and Disability 32.1 (n.d.): 99-105. Proquest Central. Web. 24 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASA career==
Metcalf-Lindenburger was selected by NASA in May 2004 as an Astronaut Candidate. Astronaut Candidate Training includes orientation briefings and tours, numerous scientific and technical briefings, intensive instruction in [[Space Shuttle program|Shuttle]] and [[International Space Station]] systems, [[physiological]] training, [[T-38 Talon|T-38]] flight training, and water and wilderness survival training. Successful completion of this training in February 2006 qualified her as a NASA Astronaut.  She served as a Mission Specialist on [[STS-131]], an April 2010 Space Shuttle mission to the [[International Space Station]]. The mission's primary payload was the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module.

On July 20, 2009, Metcalf-Lindenburger sang the [[National Anthem]] at the [[Houston Astros]] game against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in celebration of the 40th anniversary of the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing. She has been a long-time lead singer with the all-astronaut rock band, "[[Max Q (Astronaut band)|Max Q]]".

On April 16, 2012, NASA announced that Metcalf-Lindenburger would command the [[NEEMO#NEEMO 16: June 11–22, 2012|NEEMO 16]] undersea exploration mission aboard the [[Aquarius (laboratory)|Aquarius]] [[Underwater habitat|underwater laboratory]], scheduled to begin on June 11, 2012 and last twelve days.&lt;ref name="sixteen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2012/apr/HQ_12-116_NEEMO.html |title=NASA – NASA Announces 16th Undersea Exploration Mission Dates and Crew |author=NASA |date=April 16, 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NEEMO 16 crew successfully "splashed down" at 11:05 am on June 11.&lt;ref name="sixteen2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/659389main_Topside%20Report-MD01-Final.pdf |title=NEEMO 16 Mission Day 1 – Status Report |author=The NEEMO Mission Management and Topside Support Team |date=June 11, 2012 |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the morning of June 12, Metcalf-Lindenburger and her crewmates officially became aquanauts, having spent over 24 hours underwater.&lt;ref name="sixteen3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/659661main_Topside-Report-MD02-Final.pdf |title=NEEMO 16 Mission Day 2 – Status Report |author=The NEEMO Mission Management and Topside Support Team |date=June 12, 2012 |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The crew safely returned to the surface on June 22.&lt;ref name="sixteen4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/662324main_Topside-Report-MD12-Final.pdf |title=NEEMO 16 Mission Day 12 – Status Report |author=The NEEMO Mission Management and Topside Support Team |date=June 22, 2012 |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metcalf-Lindenburger retired from NASA on June 13, 2014, to live and work in the Seattle area.

===Spaceflights===
STS-131 Discovery (April 5 to April 20, 2010), a resupply mission to the International Space Station, was launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida.  On arrival at the station, Discovery’s crew dropped off more than 27,000 pounds of hardware, supplies and equipment, including a tank full of ammonia coolant that required three spacewalks to hook up, new crew sleeping quarters and three experiment racks.  On the return journey, Leonardo, the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) inside Discovery’s payload bay, was packed with more than 6,000 pounds of hardware, science results and trash.   The STS-131 mission was accomplished in 15 days, 02 hours, 47 minutes and 10 seconds and traveled 6,232,235 statute miles in 238 Earth orbits.

==Biography==

Hilderbrand spent her summers on [[Cape Cod]], "playing touch football at low tide, collecting sea glass, digging pools for [[hermit crabs]], swimming out to the wooden raft off shore," until her father died in a plane crash when she was sixteen. She spent the next summer working, doing piecework in a factory that made Halloween costumes; she promised herself that the goal for the rest of her life would be that she would always have a real summer. She moved to [[Nantucket]] in July 1993, took a job as "the classified ads girl" at a local paper, and later started writing.&lt;ref name = "Oprah.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=What I Know for Sure about Sand in My Sheets  |journal="Oprah" |url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/What-Elin-Hilderbrand-Knows-for-Sure-about-Summer#ixzz2RbtV0xgM |author=Elin Hilderbrand |date=June 23, 2011, 2013 |accessdate=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth Marney Conner''' ([[pen name]] '''Paul Veronique'''; February 26, 1856 – ?) was a 19th-century American dramatic reader and educator, and the founder of the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] School of [[Elocution]]. She published recitations in both prose and verse, and was also the author of an [[operetta]].

==Early years and education==
Elizabeth Marney was born in [[Rouses Point, New York]], February 26, 1856.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=200}} 

==Career==
At the age of 18, she married Marcus A. Conner, of [[Burlington, Vermont]],{{sfn|Moulton|1890|p=18}} who died in 1881 in a drowning accident,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shocking Fatality|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12428088/shocking_fatality_the_burlington_free/|accessdate=17 July 2017|publisher=''[[The Burlington Free Press]]''|date=9 July 1881|location=Burlington, Vermont|page=3|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving her with two young sons to care for and educate. It was then Conner began to consider her ambitions. With decided abilities for music, literature and the drama, circumstances led her to choose some form of dramatic work, and she began the careful study of elocution. In January, 1884, the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] School of Elocution and Literature was opened by Conner,{{sfn|Moulton|1890|p=18}} and after then, she rapidly succeeded as teacher and artist in her profession, having gained for herself and school an enviable local reputation, and being well-known in a far wider territory. Her lecture on "Expression" with illustrative readings was in demand from school, pulpit and platform. 

She published recitations in both prose and verse under the pen-name "Paul Veronique," a strong poem, "Death of Samson". She also composed a song entitled "Be not so Sure", which was well received,{{sfn|Werner's Magazine Company|1894|p=112}} and was also the author of the operetta "Eulalie, a Fairy Operetta in Two Acts, for Children" (libretto by Conner, music by Mary M. Howard).{{sfn|Werner's Magazine|1887|p=36}} Although her success as a teacher and reader was exceptional, it was considered by many that her true place was on the stage. She had a strong personality and magnetic presence, intense dramatic fervor, a fine voice and versatile powers of expression.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=200}}

==Buffalo School of Elocution and Literature==
Conner came to Buffalo with the object of establishing a training school of elocution and English literature. She made arrangements with the [[Young Men's Christian Association|YMCA]], and secured the necessary rooms for her venture before the outside doors were on the new building, which was nearing completion. The Buffalo School of Elocution and Literature was opened on the January 10, 1884, and was, from the beginning, a success. Establishing an institution of learning in a large city necessitated long hours; but the results were exemplary.{{sfn|Moulton|1888|p=307}}

The methods employed by Conner were far advanced than any ever before attempted in Buffalo. The physical and vocal drill class was a novelty, and was, from the first, highly prized by the students. The vocal practice eradicated all nasal, shrill, and guttural tones, while the [[François Delsarte|Delsarte]] method of exercising every muscle of the frame was beneficial to the body. As a preliminary to graduation from the Training School of Elocution, each pupil was required to give a public reading, the audience consisting of invited friends. These entertainments, in Association Hall, afforded a literary treat to the audience, and were an index of the accomplishments to be achieved by a course of study in such a school and under a teacher whose refining influence left an indelible impression on the pupil.{{sfn|Moulton|1888|p=307}}

At the close of the second year of the school, three pupils were graduated with honor. One became a teacher of elocution in the Buffalo High School. Another was for a long time associated with Conner in the school work. The third became a professional reader. On the completion of the third year, three more pupils received diplomas. One of that number, subsequently received the degree of Bachelor of Oratory at the Monroe School in [[Boston]]. The following year witnessed the graduation of six more pupils, some of whom became employed in the theatrical profession, in lecturing, reading, and teaching. Seven pupils were graduated in the class of 1888, and a larger number of juniors received certificates than at any previous year. Aside from the graduates' and postgraduates' recitals, the school gave frequent entertainments, such as "Shakespeare" and "Longfellow" afternoons, "Dickens," "Bryant,"' and "Whittier" evenings. Special lectures were given in connection with the regular course of study.{{sfn|Moulton|1888|p=307}}

Owing to the constant increase of business, it became necessary for Conner to seek larger and more commodious quarters than the WMCA building afforded. A new location, located at the junction of Mohawk, Genesee and Pearl streets, was secured. It was enlarged by establishing a second department, the Conservatory of Music under the able direction of Mary M. Howard, of Buffalo.{{sfn|Moulton|1888|p=307}} After operating the school for more than a decade, Conner left Buffalo in 1898 to give elocution recitals on a tour of the Pacific coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Social Chronicle|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252021%2FBuffalo%2520NY%2520Evening%2520News%2FBuffalo%2520NY%2520Evening%2520News%25201898%2FBuffalo%2520NY%2520Evening%2520News%25201898%2520-%25203381.pdf%23xml%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FdtSearch%2Fdtisapi6.dll%3Fcmd%3Dgetpdfhits%26u%3Dffffffffecf20d67%26DocId%3D7598361%26Index%3DZ%253a%255cIndex%2520I%252dE%252dV%26HitCount%3D5%26hits%3D6bb%2B6bc%2B6bd%2B6e2%2B6f1%2B%26SearchForm%3D%252fFulton%255fNew%255fform%252ehtml%26.pdf&amp;uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252021%2FBuffalo%2520NY%2520Evening%2520News%2FBuffalo%2520NY%2520Evening%2520News%25201898%2FBuffalo%2520NY%2520Evening%2520News%25201898%2520-%25203381.pdf&amp;xml=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FdtSearch%2Fdtisapi6.dll%3Fcmd%3Dgetpdfhits%26u%3Dffffffffecf20d67%26DocId%3D7598361%26Index%3DZ%253a%255cIndex%2520I%252dE%252dV%26HitCount%3D5%26hits%3D6bb%2B6bc%2B6bd%2B6e2%2B6f1%2B%26SearchForm%3D%252fFulton%255fNew%255fform%252ehtml%26.pdf&amp;openFirstHlPage=false|accessdate=17 July 2017|publisher=''[[The Buffalo Evening News]]''|date=4 June 1898|location=Buffalo, New York|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She remained in the west for several years, working with a western college, before returning to New York in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Elizabeth Marney Conner’s Work|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252021%2FBuffalo%2520NY%2520Courier%2FBuffalo%2520Ny%2520Courier%25201905%2FBuffalo%2520Ny%2520Courier%25201905%2520a%2520-%25200436.pdf%23xml%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FdtSearch%2Fdtisapi6.dll%3Fcmd%3Dgetpdfhits%26u%3D3dcd242c%26DocId%3D6890500%26Index%3DZ%253a%255cIndex%2520I%252dE%252dV%26HitCount%3D6%26hits%3Da42%2Ba43%2Ba44%2Ba49%2Ba4a%2Ba4b%2B%26SearchForm%3D%252fFulton%255fNew%255fform%252ehtml%26.pdf&amp;uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252021%2FBuffalo%2520NY%2520Courier%2FBuffalo%2520Ny%2520Courier%25201905%2FBuffalo%2520Ny%2520Courier%25201905%2520a%2520-%25200436.pdf&amp;xml=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FdtSearch%2Fdtisapi6.dll%3Fcmd%3Dgetpdfhits%26u%3D3dcd242c%26DocId%3D6890500%26Index%3DZ%253a%255cIndex%2520I%252dE%252dV%26HitCount%3D6%26hits%3Da42%2Ba43%2Ba44%2Ba49%2Ba4a%2Ba4b%2B%26SearchForm%3D%252fFulton%255fNew%255fform%252ehtml%26.pdf&amp;openFirstHlPage=false|accessdate=17 July 2017|publisher=''[[Buffalo Courier-Express|The Buffalo Courier]]''|date=11 February 1905|location=Buffalo, New York|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follower of [[Christian Science]], in 1906, in Buffalo, she was one of the founders of the International Progressive Thought League, along with [[Grace Carew Sheldon]].

The '''Hinckley Institute of Politics''' is a nonpartisan institute located on the [[University of Utah]] campus in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. Its purpose is "to engage students in transformative experiences and provide political thought leadership"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/mission/|title=Mission|website=Hinckley Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; through involving students in practical [[politics]] and in governmental, civic and political processes.

Known for its internship program which has sent thousands of students to local, national, and global internship opportunities, the Hinckley Institute also provides educational programs for students, public school teachers and the general public.

==History==
The Hinckley Institute was founded by [[Robert H. Hinckley]] in 1965 as a way to engage students in government and “encourage the youngest and best minds to enter into politics.” Since that time, the Hinckley Institute has helped to provide more than 7,000 students with internships opportunities. Students have been placed with various organizations, such as public offices, elected officials, non-government organizations, for-profit corporations, political campaigns, and non-profits.

In addition to internships, the Hinckley Institute offers publicly available political forums, [[scholarships]], classes, excursions to [[Washington DC]]  and a campaign management minor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/campaign-management-minor/|title=Campaign Management Minor|website=Hinckley Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership ==
Since its founding in 1965, the Hinckley Institute has been led by five directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/directors/|title=Directors|website=Hinckley Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Kirk Jowers, J.D. 2005-2015
* Jason Perry, J.D. 2016–present

==Internships==
The Hinckley Institute has provided University of Utah students with internship opportunities since 1966 and currently sends around 350 students every year to local, legislative, national, and global internships.

===Local===
The Hinckley Institute sends approximately 150 students each year to the most prestigious organizations in the Salt Lake City area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/local-internships|title=Local-Overview|website=Hinckley Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students must register for at least three hours of course credit to participate. HNKLY classes are subject to standard tuition rates.  Students can calculate their tuition costs here. Internships are available all semesters and open to students of all majors. Hinckley interns who have worked in local internships have done things like: serve as campaign managers, scheduling coordinators, and volunteer supervisors for races in Utah and have worked in local offices for [[List of United States Senators from Utah|U.S. Senators]] and [[List of United States Representatives from Utah|Congressmen]], mayors, the Utah [[Lieutenant Governor of Utah|Lt. Governor]]’s office, the Attorney General’s office and the [[Chamber of Commerce]]. They have also worked in a number of non-profit organizations such as the [[American Cancer Society]] and the Utah Disability Law Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/internships/local/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623190644/http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/internships/local/index.html |archivedate=2008-06-23 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislative ===
Hinckley Interns function as support staff to aid legislators''' '''during the spring semester of each year. An intern may be asked to track legislation, write speeches, attend committee meetings, research issues, and analyze bills. Hinckley interns at the Utah State Legislature must adapt to a rigorous work schedule, take initiative in planning and organizing, and develop an effective working relationship with legislators. The Utah State Legislature Internship program offers students unparalleled access to the Utah legislative process. Interns serve as '''full-time staff to legislators, lobbyists, and the media''' during the 45-day legislative session that begin in late January and work on a part-time basis in the weeks preceding the start of the session. Legislative interns '''are not able to take other classes during this session''' due to the full-time work schedule. Each legislative intern is '''paid $2,775''' by the Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel. State legislative interns represent the University of Utah and the Hinckley Institute of Politics, and therefore, the highest conduct is expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/legislative-internships|title=Legislative Internships|website=Hinckley Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National===
The Hinckley Institute of Politics has sent interns to [[Washington, D.C.]] since 1973, providing more than 100 students annually with full-time, paid internships in a variety of government institutions, public advocacy groups, and media/consulting firms. Hinckley interns are provided internship scholarships to cover expenses (if internship is unpaid), subsidized housing in central DC apartments, and up to 12 hours of academic credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/nationa-overview/|title=National-Overview|website=Hinckley Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These interns work for members of the [[United States congressional delegations from Utah|Utah delegation]] on [[Capitol Hill]], the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], and major think tanks that affect American national policy. Offices that have hosted Hinckley interns include the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], the [[Democratic National Committee]], the [[Republican National Committee]], the [[House Committee on International Relations]], and the [[White House]]. Students shadow legislators, congressmen and senators as well as learn the methods of [[lobbying]], media coverage, and communication within the U.S. national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/internships/washington/index.html |title=Internships: Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2008-06-06 |publisher=Hinckley Institute |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512160435/http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/internships/washington/index.html |archivedate=2008-05-12 |df= }}  &lt;/ref&gt;

==== Notable National Internship Opportunities ====
In 2008 the Hinckley Institute of Politics teamed up with the [[Li Ka-shing]] Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lksf.org/|title=Li Ka Shing Foundation|website=www.lksf.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Hong Kong, China to send five students from the University of Utah and seven students from Shantou University in Shantou, China to work as student journalists during the 2008 presidential election. The students were led by Frank Folwell, former photography editor of ''[[USA Today]]'' and his wife Sherry Riccardi. The students attended both the [[2008 Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[2008 Republican National Convention|Republican Conventions]]. From there they traveled to Washington, D.C. where they established their headquarters in the offices of Policy Impact,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.policyimpact.com/|title=Policy Impact Communications – Influence Where it Matters Most|website=www.policyimpact.com|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lobbying and public relations organization under the leadership of William Nixon (a Fellow of the Hinckley Institute of Politics).

===Global===
The Hinckley Institute runs the University of Utah’s Global Internship Program for all [[University of Utah]] students. The program has grown into what is considered in U.S. academia one of the most comprehensive and prestigious international internship programs. Global internships are available for undergraduate and graduate students of all disciplines in more than 50 countries. Academic credit and funding are available for fall, spring, and summer semesters. The goal of the Hinckley Institute's global internship program is to provide students with full-time, global work, cultural immersion, and career development opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/global-internships-overview/|title=Global-Overview|website=Hinckley Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of internships include working with the Scottish or Australian parliament, doing humanitarian work in [[South America]] and [[Africa]], and teaching women and children in [[India]] about [[AIDS]] prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/internships/international/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623104140/http://www.hinckley.utah.edu/internships/international/index.html |archivedate=2008-06-23 |df= }}  &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Housekeeping''' refers to the management of duties and chores involved in the running of a [[household]], such as [[cleaner|cleaning]], [[cooking]], [[home maintenance]], [[shopping]], [[laundry]] and [[Invoice|bill]] pay. These tasks may be performed by any of the household members, or by other persons hired to perform these tasks. The term is also used to refer to the money allocated for such use.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/housekeeping?q=housekeeping "housekeeping"] ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|Oxford Dictionaries Online]]''. Retrieved 2 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, an office or organization, as well as the [[Housekeeping (computing)|maintenance]] of [[computer storage]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/housekeeping?showCookiePolicy=true "housekeeping"] ''[[The Collins English Dictionary]]''. Retrieved 2 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] is a person employed to manage a household,&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/housekeeper "housekeeper"] ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|Oxford Dictionaries Online]]''. Retrieved 2 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[domestic staff]]. According to the Victorian Era ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'', the housekeeper is second in command in the house and "except in large establishments, where there is a house steward, the housekeeper must consider his/herself as the immediate representative of her mistress".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/beeton/isabella/household/chapter2.html#chapter2  ''Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management''] Web version of the book at the [[University of Adelaide]] Library.

==Housecleaning==
[[File:Broom, sponge and towel.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Broom, sponge and duster]]
[[File:A Day in the Life of a Wartime Housewife- Everyday Life in London, England, 1941 D2366.jpg|thumb|Part of the housework of a London housewife, 1941]]
It includes activities such as housecleaning, that is, disposing of [[rubbish]], cleaning dirty surfaces, dusting and [[Vacuum cleaner|vacuuming]]. It may also involve some outdoor chores, such as removing leaves from rain gutters, washing windows and sweeping doormats. The term housecleaning is often used also figuratively in politics and business, for the removal of unwanted personnel, methods or policies in an effort at reform or improvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/housecleaning The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language] Retrieved 2011-01-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Housecleaning is done to make the home look and smell better and be safer and easier to live in. Without housecleaning [[lime scale]] can build up on [[Tap (valve)|tap]]s, [[mold]] grows in wet areas,  smudges on glass surfaces, dust forms on surfaces, [[bacteria]]l action make the garbage disposal and toilet smell and [[spider|cobwebs]] accumulate. Tools used in housecleaning include [[vacuum cleaner|vacuums]], [[broom]]s, [[mop]]s and [[Sponge (material)|sponges]], together with cleaning products such as [[detergent]]s, [[disinfectant]]s and [[bleach]].

===Removal of litter===
Disposal of rubbish is an important aspect of house cleaning. Plastic bags are designed and manufactured specifically for the collection of litter. Many are sized to fit common waste baskets and trash cans. Paper bags are made to carry aluminum cans, glass jars and other things although most people use plastic bins for glass since it could break and tear through the bag. [[Recycling]] is possible with some kinds of litter.&lt;ref&gt;Dellutri, Laura. 2005. Speed Cleaning 101. Meredith Books, Des Moines, Iowa.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dusting===
[[File:Some dusting tools.PNG|right|thumb|95px|Some dusting tools]]
Over time [[dust]] accumulates on household surfaces. As well as making the surfaces dirty, when dust is disturbed it can become suspended in the air, causing sneezing and breathing trouble. It can also transfer from furniture to clothing, making it unclean. Various tools have been invented for dust removal; [[Feather duster|Feather and lamb’s wool dusters]], cotton and polyester dust cloths, furniture spray, disposable paper "dust cloths", dust mops for smooth floors and vacuum cleaners. Vacuum cleaners often have a variety of tools to enable them to remove dirt not just from carpets and rugs, but from hard surfaces and upholstery.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Rose.  2006. 10-Minute Housekeeping. Beverly, MA: Fair Winds Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Dusting is very important in hospital environments.&lt;ref&gt;''Executive Housekeeping Today'' (2004), Volumes 23-25, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal of dirt===
[[File:US Army 51089 Unsung heroes.jpg|thumb|Two women cleaning the floor]]
Examples of dirt or "soil" are [[detritus]] and common spills and stains that exists in the home. Equipment used with a cleaner might be a bucket and sponge or a rag. A modern tool is the spray bottle, but the principle is the same.

===Household chemicals===

Various household cleaning products have been developed to facilitate the removal of dust and dirt, for surface maintenance, and for disinfection.&lt;ref name="Wolkoff P 1998 pg. 135–156"&gt;Wolkoff P, Schneider T, Kildeso J, Degerth R, Jaroszewski, and Schunk H. Science of the Total Environment, 215, (1998) pg. 135–156&lt;/ref&gt; Products are available in powder, liquid or spray form. The basic ingredients determine the type of cleaning tasks for which they are suitable. Some are packaged as general purpose cleaning materials while others are targeted at specific cleaning tasks such as drain clearing, oven cleaning, lime scale removal and polishing furniture. Household cleaning products provide aesthetic and hygiene benefits but are also associated with health risks for the users, and building occupants.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon KD, Jo WK, Lim JH, and Jcong WS. Environ Sci Pollut Res 15, (2008) pg. 521–526&lt;/ref&gt; The US Department of Health and Human Services offers the public access to the Household Products Database.  This database provides consumer information for over 4,000 products based on information provided by the manufacturer through the [[material safety data sheet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hpd.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/household/prodtree?prodcat=Inside+the+Home | title=Household Products Database | publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Surfactant]]s lower the surface tension of water, making it able to flow into smaller tiny cracks and crevices in soils making removal easier. [[Alkaline]] chemicals break down known soils such as grease and mud. [[Acid]]s break down soils such as lime scale, [[soap scum]], and stains of mustard, coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages. Some [[solvent]]-based products are flammable and some can dissolve paint and varnish. [[Disinfectants]] stop smell and stains caused by bacteria.

When multiple chemicals are applied to the same surface without full removal of the earlier substance, the chemicals may interact. This interaction may result in a reduction of the efficiency of the chemicals applied (such as a change in [[pH]] value caused by mixing alkalis and acids) and in cases may even emit toxic fumes. An example of this is the mixing of ammonia-based cleaners (or acid-based cleaners) and bleach.&lt;ref name="Nazaroff, WW. 2004"&gt;Nazaroff, WW., Weschler, CJ., Atmospheric Environment. 38 (2004) pg. 2841–2865&lt;/ref&gt; This causes the production of [[chloramines]] that volatilize (become gaseous) causing acute [[inflammation]] of the lungs (toxic pneumonitis), long-term respiratory damage, and potential death.&lt;ref&gt;Reisz, GR., Gammon, RS. Toxic Pneumonitis from mixing household chemicals. CHEST 89 (1986) pg. 49–52&lt;/ref&gt;

Residue from cleaning products and cleaning activity (dusting, vacuuming, sweeping) have been shown to impact [[indoor air quality]] (IAQ) by redistributing [[particulates|particulate matter]] (dust, dirt, human skin cells, organic matter, animal [[dander]], particles from [[combustion]], fibers from insulation, [[pollen]], and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]]) that gaseous or liquid particles become adsorbed to. The particulate matter and chemical [[residue (chemistry)|residual]] will be of highest concentrations right after cleaning but will decrease over time depending upon levels of contaminants, air exchange rate, and other sources of chemical residual.&lt;ref name="Nazaroff, WW. 2004"/&gt;  Of most concern are the family of chemicals called VOCs such as [[formaldehyde]], [[toluene]], and [[limonene]].&lt;ref&gt;Burton, A. Environmental Health Perspectives – Indoor Air Quality.  Vol. 115 #7 (2007) pg. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) are released from many household cleaning products such as disinfectants, polishes, floor waxes, air-freshening sprays, all purpose cleaning sprays, and glass cleaner.  These products have been shown to emit irritating vapors.&lt;ref name="Wolkoff P 1998 pg. 135–156"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raizenne M. 1998"&gt;Raizenne M., Dales R., Burnett, R., Canadian Jour of Public Health.  Air Pollution Exposures and Children's Health. Vol. 89, Suppl. 1 May–June 1998. pg. S43–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zock, JP. 2007 pg. 735–741"&gt;Zock, JP., Plana, E., Jarvis D. et al.  Am J Resipir Crit Care Medicine. Vol. 176. (2007) pg. 735–741&lt;/ref&gt; VOCs are of most concern due to their tendency to evaporate and be inhaled into the lungs or [[adsorbed]] to existing dust, which can also be inhaled.&lt;ref name="Wolkoff P 1998 pg. 135–156"/&gt; It has been found that aerosolized (spray) cleaning products are important risk factors and may aggravate symptoms of adult [[asthma]],&lt;ref name="Zock, JP. 2007 pg. 735–741"/&gt; respiratory irritation,&lt;ref name="Wolkoff P 1998 pg. 135–156"/&gt; childhood asthma, wheeze, bronchitis, and allergy.&lt;ref name="Raizenne M. 1998"/&gt;

Other modes of exposure to potentially harmful household cleaning chemicals include absorption through the skin (dermis), accidental ingestion, and accidental splashing into the eyes.  Products for the application and safe use of the chemicals are also available, such as nylon scrub sponge and [[rubber glove]]s.
&lt;ref&gt;Bredenberg, Jeff et al. 1998. Clean it Fast, Clean it right. Emmaus, PA, USA:Rodale. {{ISBN|0-87596-509-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is up to the consumer to keep themselves safe while using these chemicals. Reading and comprehending the labels is important.

Chemicals used for cleaning toilet, sinks, and bathtubs can find their way into our sewage water and can often not be effectively removed or filtered.

There is a growing consumer and governmental interest in [[natural]] cleaning products and [[green cleaning]] methods. The use of nontoxic household chemicals is growing as consumers become more informed of the health effects of many household chemicals, and municipalities are having to deal with the expensive disposal of [[household hazardous waste]] (HHW).&lt;ref&gt;Adams, D., Werner, CM., Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy. Changing Homeowners' Behaviors Involving Toxic Household Chemicals: A psychological, multilevel approach. (2001) pg. 1–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slack, RJ., Gronow, JR., Voulvoulis N. Science of the Total Environment. 337 (2005) 119–137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tools===
[[Broom]]s remove debris from floors and [[dustpan]]s carry dust and debris swept into them, [[bucket]]s hold cleaning and rinsing solutions, [[vacuum cleaner]]s and [[carpet sweeper]]s remove surface dust and debris, [[chamois leather]] and [[squeegee]]s are used for window-cleaning, and [[mop]]s are used for washing floors.&lt;ref&gt;Bredenberg, Jeff et al. 1998. ''Clean It Fast, Clean It Right.'' Emmaus, PA: Rodale&lt;/ref&gt; Protective gear including rubber [[gloves]], [[Mask|face cover]]s, and [[Eye protection|protective eyewear]] is also used when dealing with cleaning products.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Yard===
A home's yard and exterior are sometimes subject to cleaning. Exterior cleaning also occurs for safety, upkeep and usefulness. It includes removal of paper litter and grass growing in sidewalk cracks.

==House chores==
House chores, or chores are components of housekeeping, and are usually in reference to specific tasks to be completed.   Examples of house chores are: washing dishes; taking out trash after dinner.

==Social significance==

While housekeeping can be seen as an objective activity that can be done by either men or women, some people have argued that housekeeping is a site of historical oppression and gender division between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/The-Politics-of-Housework.html | title=The Politics of Housework | publisher=Redstockings | date=1970 | accessdate=3 February 2015 | author=Mainardi, Pat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housekeeping also has a role in maintaining certain parts of the capitalist economy, including the division of home and work life, as well as industries that sell chemicals and household goods.

A survey conducted by the U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in 2014 came to the result that approximately 43 percent of men did food preparation or cleanup on any given day, compared with approximately 70 percent of women. In addition, 20 percent of men did housekeeping chores (including cleaning and laundry) on any given day, compared to approximately 50 percent of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm|title=American Time Use Survey|date=June 24, 2015|publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24243">"'''Inside the Ivory Tower'''" is a [[College and university rankings|ranking]] of the world's best [[university]] programs in [[international relations]]. The ranking is published by the ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine in collaboration with the Teaching, Research, and International Policy (TRIP) Project at the [[College of William &amp; Mary]]. The survey is based on input from "all international relations scholars employed at a college or university who have an affiliation with a political science department or school of public policy and who teach or conduct research on issues that cross international borders."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trip.wm.edu/home/index.php/surveys/faculty-survey|title=Faculty Survey|last=|first=|date=2014|website=TRIP|language=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first TRIP Faculty Survey was conducted in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wmpeople.wm.edu/asset/index/smpete/insidetheivorytower2005|title=Inside the Ivory Tower|last=Peterson|first=Susan|last2=Maliniak|first2=Dan|date=|website=Foreign Policy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Tierney|first3=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the questions asked respondents to rank International Relations graduate schools in the U.S. The survey has since expanded to include undergraduate programs.&lt;ref name="AllPubs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Academic Publications |url=https://trip.wm.edu/home/index.php/publications |work=Institute for the Theory and Practice of International Relations, TRIP |publisher=College of William &amp; Mary |accessdate=12 December 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey began including universities outside of the U.S. in 2009.&lt;ref name="ivorytower"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/15/inside-the-ivory-tower/|title=Inside the Ivory Tower|author1=Daniel Maliniak|author2=Amy Oakes|date=March–April 2009|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|accessdate=20 December 2017|author3=Susan Peterson|author4=Michael J.

'''John Allyn McAlpin Berryman''' (born '''John Allyn Smith, Jr.'''; October 25, 1914 – January 7, 1972) was an American poet and scholar, born in [[McAlester, Oklahoma|McAlester]], [[Oklahoma]]. He was a major figure in American poetry in the second half of the 20th century and was considered a key figure in the [[Confessional poetry|Confessional]] school of poetry. His best-known work is ''[[The Dream Songs]]''.

==Life and career==
John Berryman was born '''John Allyn Smith, Jr.''' in Oklahoma where he was raised until the age of ten, when his father, John Smith, a banker, and his mother, Martha (also known as Peggy), a schoolteacher, moved to Florida. In 1926, in Clearwater, Florida, when Berryman was eleven years old, his father shot and killed himself. Smith was jobless at the time, and he and Martha were both filing for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19260628&amp;id=U_RPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6VQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1995,4881277&amp;hl=pt-BR|title = Tampa man killed self, coroner's jury state|date = June 28, 1926|work = The Independent (Florida)|access-date = June 16, 2015|via = Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berryman was haunted by his father's death for the rest of his life and would later write about his struggle to come to terms with it in much of his poetry.

In "Dream Song #143", he wrote, "That mad drive [to commit suicide] wiped out my childhood. I put him down/while all the same on forty years I love him/stashed in Oklahoma/besides his brother Will". In "Dream Song #145", he also wrote the following lines about his father: 
{{poemquote|
he only, very early in the morning,
rose with his gun and went outdoors by my window
and did what was needed.

I cannot read that wretched mind, so strong
&amp; so undone. I've always tried. I&amp;ndash;I'm
trying to forgive
whose frantic passage, when he could not live
an instant longer, in the summer dawn
left Henry to live on.&lt;ref&gt;Berryman, John. "Dream Song #145". ''The Dream Songs''. New York: Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Similarly, in Dream Song #384, Berryman wrote:
{{poemquote|
The marker slants, flowerless, day's almost done,
I stand above my father's grave with rage,
often, often before
I've made this awful pilgrimage to one
who cannot visit me, who tore his page
out: I come back for more,

I spit upon this dreadful bankers grave
who shot his heart out in a Florida dawn
}}

For two years, Berryman also studied overseas at [[Clare College]], Cambridge, on a Kellett Fellowship, awarded by Columbia.&lt;ref name="Ellman 1973"/&gt; He graduated in 1936.

Regarding Berryman's earliest success in poetry, the ''Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry'' editors note that "Berryman's early work formed part of a volume entitled ''Five Young American Poets'', published by [[New Directions Publishing|New Directions]] in 1940".&lt;ref name="Ellman 1973"/&gt; One of the other young poets included in the book was [[Randall Jarrell]].

Berryman would soon publish some of this early verse in his first book, also with New Directions Publishing, simply titled ''Poems'', in 1942. However, his first mature collection of poems, ''The Dispossessed'', appeared six years later, published by William Sloane Associates. The book received largely negative reviews from poets like [[Randall Jarrell]] who wrote, in ''[[The Nation]]'', that Berryman was "a complicated, nervous, and intelligent [poet]" whose poetry in ''The Dispossessed'' was too derivative of [[W.B. Yeats|W. B. Yeats]].&lt;ref name="Mariani 1990"/&gt; Berryman would later concur with this assessment of his early work, stating, "I didn't want to be ''like'' Yeats; I wanted to ''be'' Yeats."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, James D. (1984) ''The stock of available reality: R.P. Blackmur and John Berryman'' Bucknell University Press p61 {{ISBN|0-8387-5066-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1942, Berryman married [[Eileen Simpson|Eileen Mulligan]] (later Simpson) in a ceremony at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], with Van Doren as his best man. The couple moved to [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]], where Berryman lectured at Harvard. The marriage ended in 1953 (a divorce was formalized in 1956), when Simpson finally grew weary of tolerating Berryman's affairs and acting as "net-holder" throughout his self-destructive personal crises. Simpson would memorialize her time with Berryman and his circle in her 1982 book ''Poets in Their Youth''.&lt;ref name="yardley"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yardley|first1=Jonathan|title=In the Beginning, Such a Happy Couplet|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/15/AR2006101501018.html|accessdate=29 April 2016|publisher=Washington Post|date=October 16, 2006|ref=yardley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Berryman started an affair with a married woman named Chris, documented in a long sonnet sequence that he refrained from publishing, in part, because publication of the sonnets would have revealed the affair to his wife. However, he did eventually decide to publish the work, titled ''Berryman's Sonnets'', in 1967. The work included over one hundred sonnets.&lt;ref name="Mariani 1990"/&gt;

In 1950, Berryman published a biography of the fiction writer and poet [[Stephen Crane]] whom he greatly admired, becoming "the only biography by a leading American poet of the great American writer, Stephen Crane."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us.macmillan.com/stephencrane/johnberryman|title=Stephen Crane {{!}} John Berryman {{!}} Macmillan|last=Macmillan|website=Macmillan|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book was followed by his next significant poem, ''Homage to Mistress Bradstreet'' (1956), which featured illustrations by the artist [[Ben Shahn]] and was Berryman's first poem to receive "national attention" and a positive response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/john-berryman Poetry Foundation profile]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Wilson]] wrote that it was "the most distinguished long poem by an American since [[T.S. Eliot|T. S. Eliot's]] ''[[The Waste Land]]''." When "Homage to Mistress Bradstreet and Other Poems" was published in 1959, the poet [[Conrad Aiken]] praised the shorter poems in the book which he thought were actually better than "Homage to Mistress Bradstreet".&lt;ref&gt;Berryman, John. ''Homage to Mistress Bradstreet and other poems.'' New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the relative success of his third book of verse, Berryman's great poetic breakthrough occurred after he published ''[[The Dream Songs|77 Dream Songs]]'' in 1964. It won the 1965 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for poetry and solidified Berryman's standing as one of the most important poets of the post-World War II generation that included [[Robert Lowell]], [[Elizabeth Bishop]], and [[Delmore Schwartz]]. Soon afterwards, Berryman started receiving a great deal of national attention from the press, from arts organizations, and even from the White House which sent him an invitation to dine with President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (though Berryman had to decline because he was in [[Ireland]] at the time).&lt;ref name="Mariani 1990"/&gt; Berryman was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1967,&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=2011-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that same year ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine ran a feature story on him. Also, that year the newly created [[National Endowment for the Arts]] awarded him a ten thousand dollar grant (though he admitted, when asked about the award by a Minneapolis reporter, that he had never heard of the organization before).&lt;ref name="Mariani 1990"/&gt;

Berryman also continued to work on the "dream song" poems at a feverish pace and published a second, significantly longer, volume entitled ''[[The Dream Songs|His Toy, His Dream, His Rest]]'', in 1968, which won the [[National Book Award for Poetry]] and the [[Bollingen Prize]].&lt;ref name=nba1969&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;(With acceptance speech by Berryman and essay by Kiki Petrosino from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.)&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Berryman republished ''77 Dreams Songs'' and ''His Toy, His Dream, His Rest'' as one book titled ''[[The Dream Songs]]'', in which the character Henry serves as Berryman's alter ego. But in ''Love &amp; Fame'' (1970), he dropped the mask of Henry to write more plainly about his life. Responses to the poems from critics and most of Berryman's peers ranged from tepid, at best, to hostile; now the collection is generally "considered a minor work".&lt;ref name="poetrymagazines.org.uk"&gt;Galassi, Jonathan. "John Berryman: Sorrows and Passions of His Majesty the Ego." Poetry Nation, No. 2, 1974. 117-124. {{cite web |url=http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=3558 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519042931/http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=3558 |archivedate=2011-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Henry reappeared in a couple of poems published in ''Delusions Etc.,'' (1972), Berryman's last collection, which focused on his religious concerns and his own spiritual rebirth. The book was published posthumously and, like its predecessor, ''Love &amp; Fame'', it is considered a minor work.&lt;ref name="poetrymagazines.org.uk"/&gt;

Berryman taught or lectured at a number of universities including [[University of Iowa]] (in their [[Iowa Writer's Workshop|Writer's Workshop]]), [[Harvard University]], [[Princeton University]], the [[University of Cincinnati]], and the [[University of Minnesota]], where he spent the majority of his career, except for his sabbatical year in 1962-3, when he taught at [[Brown University]]. Some of his illustrious students included [[W. D. Snodgrass]], [[William Dickey (poet)|William Dickey]], [[Donald Justice]], [[Philip Levine (poet)|Philip Levine]], [[Robert Dana]], [[Jane Cooper]], [[Donald Finkel]], and [[Henri Coulette]]. Philip Levine stated, in a recorded interview from 2009, that Berryman took his class extremely seriously and that "he was entrancing ... magnetic and inspiring and very hard on [his students'] work ... [and] he was [also] the best teacher that I ever had".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|W9CLUCuX90w|Philip Levine in conversation with Naomi Jaffa at Aldeburgh Poetry Festival in November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berryman was fired from the University of Iowa after a fight with his landlord led to him being arrested, jailed overnight, and fined for disorderly conduct and public intoxication.&lt;ref name="Mariani 1990"/&gt; He turned to his friend, the poet [[Allen Tate]], who helped him get his teaching job at the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=CityPages&gt;Healy, Steve (September 9, 1998). [https://web.archive.org/web/20100520044308/http://www.citypages.com/1998-09-09/feature/john-berryman/ "John Berryman: The Dreamer Awakes."] ''[[City Pages]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Berryman was married three times. According to the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry'', he lived turbulently.&lt;ref name="Ellman 1973"/&gt; During one of the many times he was hospitalized in order to detox from alcohol abuse, in 1970, he experienced what he termed "a sort of religious conversion". According to his biographer [[Paul Mariani]], Berryman experienced "a sudden and radical shift from a belief in a transcendent God ... to a belief in a God who cared for the individual fates of human beings and who even interceded for them."&lt;ref name="Mariani 1990"/&gt;  Nevertheless, Berryman continued to abuse alcohol and to struggle with depression, as he had throughout much of his adult life, and on the morning of January 7, 1972, he killed himself by jumping from the [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], Minnesota, onto the west bank of the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name=CityPages/&gt;

==Poetry==
Berryman's poetry, which often revolved around the sordid details of his personal problems (in ''The Dream Songs'' but also in his other poems as well) is closely associated with the [[Confessional poetry]] movement. In this sense, his poetry had much in common with the poetry of his friend, [[Robert Lowell]]. The editors of ''The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry'' note that "the influence of [[W.B. Yeats|Yeats]], [[W.H. Auden|Auden]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins|Hopkins]], [[Hart Crane|Crane]], and [[Ezra Pound|Pound]] on him was strong, and Berryman's own voice—by turns nerve-racked and sportive—took some time to be heard."&lt;ref name="Ellman 1973"/&gt;

Berryman's first major work, in which he began to develop his own unique style of writing, was ''Homage to Mistress Bradstreet'', published in 1956. In the long, title poem, which first appeared in ''[[Partisan Review]]'' in 1953, Berryman addressed the 17th century American poet [[Anne Bradstreet]], combining the history of her life with his own fantasies about her (and inserting himself into the poem). Joel Athey noted, "This difficult poem, a tribute to the [[Puritan]] poet of [[colonial America]], took Berryman five years to complete and demanded much from the reader when it first appeared with no notes. ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' hailed it as a path-breaking masterpiece; poet [[Robert Fitzgerald]] called it 'the poem of his generation.'"&lt;ref&gt;Athey, Joel. ''American National Biography''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. Copyright © 1999 by the American Council of Learned Societies.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Hirsch]] observed that "the 57 [[stanza]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of ''Homage to Mistress Bradstreet'' combine the concentration of an extended lyric with the erudition and amplitude of a historical novel".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/08/books/taking-glee-in-his-wayward-past.html?ref=bookreviews Hirsch, Edward. "Taking glee in the past"]. ''The New York Times''  October 8, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berryman's major poetic breakthrough came after he began to publish the first volume of ''[[The Dream Songs]]'', ''77 Dream Songs'', in 1964. The dream song form consisted of short, eighteen-line lyric poems in three [[stanza]]s. The poems are written in free verse although some stanzas contain irregular rhyme. ''77 Dream Songs'' (and its sequel ''His Toy, His Dream, His Rest'') centers on a character named "Henry" who bears a striking resemblance to John Berryman. However, Berryman was careful about making sure that his readers realized that "Henry" was not his equivalent, but rather a fictional version of himself (or a literary [[alter ego]]). In an interview, Berryman stated, "Henry does resemble me, and I resemble Henry; but on the other hand I am not Henry. You know, I pay income tax; Henry pays no income tax. And bats come over and they stall in my hair — and fuck them, I'm not Henry; Henry doesn't have any bats."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/berryman/interviews.htm "An Interview with John Berryman"] conducted by John Plotz of the Harvard Advocate on Oct. 27, 1968. In Berryman's Understanding: Reflections on the Poetry of John Berryman. Ed. Harry Thomas. Boston: Northeastern UP, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of ''77 Dream Songs'', [[John Malcolm Brinnin]] praised the book, declaring that "[the book's] excellence calls for celebration".&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/08/23/97413583.pdf Brinner, John Malcolm. "The Last Minstrel."] ''New York Times''. 23 August 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; And in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', [[Robert Lowell]] also reviewed the book, writing, "At first the brain aches and freezes at so much darkness, disorder and oddness. After a while, the repeated situations and their racy jabber become more and more enjoyable, although even now I wouldn't trust myself to paraphrase accurately at least half the sections."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/berryman/dreamsongs.htm Robert Lowell, "John Berryman" in Robert Giroux, Ed., ''Collected Prose''] (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1987) 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the perceived difficulty of the dream songs, in his 366th "Dream Song", Berryman facetiously wrote, "These Songs are not meant to be understood, you understand. / They are only meant to terrify &amp; comfort".

In ''His Toy, His Dream, His Rest'', many of the dream songs are elegies for Berryman's recently deceased poet friends, including [[Delmore Schwartz]], [[Randall Jarrell]], and [[Theodore Roethke]]. Since this volume contained four times the number of poems that appeared in the previous volume, Berryman covered a lot more subject matter. For instance, in addition to the elegies, Berryman writes about his trip to Ireland as well as his own burgeoning literary fame.

Berryman's last two volumes of poetry, ''Love &amp; Fame'' and ''Delusions, Etc.'' featured [[Free verse|free-verse]] poems that were much more straightforward and less idiosyncratic than ''The Dream Songs''. Prior to the publication of ''Love &amp; Fame'', Berryman sent his manuscript to several peers for feedback, including the poets [[Adrienne Rich]] and [[Richard Wilbur]], both of whom were disappointed with the poems which they considered inferior to the poems in ''The Dream Songs''.&lt;ref name="Mariani 1990" /&gt; However, a number of Berryman's old friends and supporters, including the novelist [[Saul Bellow]] and the poets [[Robert Lowell]] and [[William Morris Meredith, Jr.|William Meredith]], offered high praise for a number of the ''Love &amp; Fame'' poems. Both ''Love &amp; Fame'' and ''Delusions, Etc.'' were more openly "confessional" than Berryman's earlier verse, and since he embraced religion when he wrote these volumes, he also explored the nature of his spiritual rebirth in poems like "Eleven Addresses to the Lord" (which Lowell thought was one of Berryman's best poems and "one of the great poems of the age"),&lt;ref name="Mariani 1990" /&gt; as well as "Certainty Before Lunch".

In 1977 John Haffenden published ''Henry's Fate &amp; Other Poems'', a selection of dream songs that Berryman wrote after ''His Toy, His Dream, His Rest'', but had never published. In reviewing the book, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine noted, "Posthumous selections of unpublished poetry should be viewed suspiciously. The dead poet may have had good aesthetic reasons for keeping some of his work to himself. Fortunately, ''Henry's Fate'' does not malign the memory of John Berryman".&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Paul. "A Quartet of Poets Singing Solo." ''Time''. 21 March 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berryman's ''Collected Poems--1937-1971'' edited and introduced by Charles Thornbury, was published in 1989. However, Robert Giroux decided to leave out ''The Dream Songs'' from the collection. In his review of the ''Collected Poems'', [[Edward Hirsch]] commented on this decision, stating, "It is obviously practical to continue to publish the 385 dream songs separately, but reading the ''Collected Poems'' without them is a little like eating a seven-course meal without a main course."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Hirsch also notes that, "[''Collected Poems'' features] a thorough nine-part introduction and a chronology as well as helpful appendixes that include Berryman's published prefaces, notes and dedications; a section of editor's notes, guidelines and procedures; and an account of the poems in their final stages of composition and publication."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

In 2004, the [[Library of America]] published ''John Berryman: Selected Poems'', edited by the poet [[Kevin Young (poet)|Kevin Young]]. In ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine, [[David Orr (journalist)|David Orr]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Young includes all the Greatest Hits [from Berryman's career] ... but there are also substantial excerpts from Berryman's ''Sonnets'' (the peculiar book that appeared after ''The Dream Songs'', but was written long before) and Berryman's later, overtly religious poetry. Young argues that "if his middle, elegiac period ... is most in need of rediscovery, then these late poems are most in need of redemption." It's a good point. Although portions of Berryman's late work are sloppy and erratic, these poems help clarify the spiritual struggle that motivates and sustains his best writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/176088 Orr, David]. "Eight Takes: Winters, Whittier, Hollander, Lowell, Fearing, Rukeyser, Shapiro, Berryman". ''Poetry''. December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After surveying Berryman's career and accomplishments, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry'' stated, "What seems likely to survive of his poetry is its pungent and many-leveled portrait of a complex personality which, for all its eccentricity, stayed close to the center of the intellectual and emotional life of the mid-century and after."&lt;ref name="Ellman 1973"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15983">The '''Joint Academic Coding System''' (JACS) system is used by the [[Higher Education Statistics Agency]] (HESA) and the [[Universities and Colleges Admissions Service]] (UCAS) in the [[United Kingdom]] to classify academic subjects. It is due to be replaced by the Higher Education Coding System (HECoS) and the Common Aggregation Hierarchy (CAH) for the 2019/20 academic year.&lt;ref name=farewell&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hesa.ac.uk/blog/28-04-2017/farewell-jacs-and-hello-hecos|title=Farewell to JACS, and hello to HECoS|publisher=HESA|date=27 April 2017|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A JACS code for a single subject consists of a letter and three numbers. The letter represents the broad subject classification, e.g. F for physical sciences. The first number represents the principal subject area, e.g. F3 for physics, and subsequent numbers represent further details, similar to the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]]. The principal subject of physics, for example, is broken into 19 detailed subjects, represented by a letter plus three numbers: e.g., F300 represents physics, F330 environmental physics and F331 atmospheric physics.

==History==

HESA and UCAS used to operate two different (though similar) subject coding systems - HESAcode and Standard Classification of Academic Subjects (SCAS) respectively. In 1996 a joint project was launched to bring these two system together to create a unified structure. A project team was established with two people from each of the two organisations. The project team became known as JACS since this was an acronym of their names (Jonathan Waller and Andy Youell from HESA, Clive Sillence and Sara Goodwins from UCAS).&lt;ref name=farewell/&gt;

The first operational version (v1.7) of the Joint Academic Coding System (retaining the JACS acronym) was published in 1999 and became operational in UCAS and HESA systems for the year 2002/03.

An update exercise took place in 2005 and JACS 2 was introduced for the academic year 2007/08. JACS 3 was introduced for the 2012/13 year.

==Codes==
The letter codes assigned to the subject areas and the letter + number codes assigned to the principal subjects in JACS 3 are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hesa.ac.uk/support/documentation/jacs/jacs3-principal|title=JACS 3.0: Principal subject codes|publisher=HESA|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Y codes (combined studies) are only used at the Course level in the HESA database and are not used to describe individual modules.

==JACS Codes in the UCAS system==
Course codes in the UCAS system are assigned by course providers and do not necessarily correspond to the JACS codes of the course subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucas.com/file/36576/download%3Ftoken%3DwKnv0Ur_|title=Full list of the current variables |publisher= UCAS|date=November 2016|quote=Please note: the course code is assigned to each course by the host provider and does not necessarily relate to JACS subject codes.|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; UCAS course codes are four characters in length but, unlike JACS codes, may consist of any combination of letters and numbers in any order. However, historically UCAS created course codes from the JACS subject code and many institutions continue to do this, which can lead to confusion between the two concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hediip.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/JACS_Report_2013-07.pdf|title=Classifying subject of study: A roadmap to a new Joint Academic Coding System| date=July 2013|publisher=Higher Education Data and Information Improvement Programme|accessdate=10 May 2017|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a course involves more than one subject, UCAS historically created the course code based on an aggregation of the JACS codes. For courses which are split 50:50 between two subjects, a code with two letters and two numbers is used, which combines the principal subject codes which would be used for the two subjects if studied as individual degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220214158/https://www.ucas.com/he_staff/courses/jacs/codingprinciples|archive-date=20 December 2010|url=https://www.ucas.com/he_staff/courses/jacs/codingprinciple|publisher=UCAS|title=Course coding principles|accessdate=10 May 2017|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
Consider the BSc course '''Mathematics and Physics''':
*The principal subject code for Mathematics is '''G1''', and the principal subject code for Physics is '''F3'''.
*The combined codes used are '''GF13'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.ucas.com/courses/details?coursePrimaryId=971ecf84-8baf-0c4e-9e6c-86af084bca98&amp;courseOptionId=42a85295-0a17-343c-680a-6eda9fe5f58a|title=Mathematics and Physics – University of Edinburgh|publisher=UCAS|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''FG31'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.ucas.com/courses/details?coursePrimaryId=fc9d5b6d-0a2d-9475-b3b8-7fd46cb95966&amp;courseOptionId=d643d300-cacf-39b7-7655-f0698b0fc757|title=Mathematics and Physics – University of Manchester |publisher=UCAS|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The codes '''GFD3''', '''GF1H''' and '''GFH1''' are also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.ucas.com/courses/details?coursePrimaryId=2717f1c0-6716-2247-6427-bd91cce346d3&amp;courseOptionId=2715730a-7cc2-8b9c-7ec1-a93e89e9dd7b|title=Mathematics and Physics – University of Bristol |publisher=UCAS|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.ucas.com/courses/details?coursePrimaryId=7de40e6d-6e82-ee6c-b270-89d7f4a91016&amp;courseOptionId=549a2e3e-b1ab-f49d-780a-7928b0c2b5c2|title=Mathematics and Physics – University of Surrey |publisher=UCAS|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.ucas.com/courses/details?coursePrimaryId=7c8421b9-c8f2-c7fc-f16e-332f11b96dae&amp;courseOptionId=7902fe7d-93b7-80b4-46bf-96385ab31d3b|title=Mathematics and Physics – University of Surrey (sandwich)|publisher=UCAS|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is '''Music and Philosophy'''. The principal subject codes are '''W3''' (Music) and '''V5''' (Philosophy). The combined codes used are  '''WV35'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.ucas.com/courses/details?coursePrimaryId=4cda0d62-c344-54ff-4366-6923d47a1c16&amp;courseOptionId=d1355c12-0f5c-0226-bccb-960dd320e0ec|title=Music and Philosophy – University of Nottingham|publisher=UCAS|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''VW35''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.ucas.com/courses/details?coursePrimaryId=e36cff50-021c-36d0-e37a-4131d3ce26ad&amp;courseOptionId=4f560230-1ba8-9164-05e7-b642636809a2|title=Music and Philosophy – University of Sheffield |publisher=UCAS|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while '''WV53''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.ucas.com/courses/details?coursePrimaryId=ba5c79da-fe87-a452-7220-8a1d5dd10b07&amp;courseOptionId=446cc56a-7a90-ee90-ffd2-7069e1f4d695|title=Music and Philosophy – Durham University|publisher=UCAS|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also used.

The same letter can be used twice (if the two subjects are within the same general subject area), such as '''FF53''' for '''Astronomy and Physics'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.ucas.com/courses/details?coursePrimaryId=da6c889b-6c5d-7cb8-734e-ccd169d6f63a&amp;courseOptionId=e71c28df-bce5-5dd0-5703-0b3850ef8c1c|title=Astronomy and Physics – University of Glasgow|publisher=UCAS|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courses with major/minor subjects===
Coding is done differently for courses such as "Mathematics '''with''' Physics", which is not the same as "Mathematics '''and''' Physics".

The format for such courses is Y1Z9 where:
*Y1 is the "major" subject which represents most of the degree course
*Z9 is the "minor" subject which represents less of the course.

For example, Mathematics with Physics would be represented by G1F3, but Physics with Mathematics would be represented by F3G1. Hence the order in which the two subjects are notated was important historically.

'''Le Cordon Bleu''' {{IPA-fr|lə kɔʁdɔ̃ blø|}} ([[French language|French]] for "[[blue ribbon|The Blue Ribbon]]") is a hospitality education institution, with 23 schools on five continents. Its education focus is on [[hospitality management studies|hospitality management]], [[culinary art]]s, and [[gastronomy]].

== History ==

[[File:Le duc de Saint-Aignan donnant à Rome au prince Vaini le cordon de l'ordre du Saint-Esprit.jpg|thumb|[[Duc de Saint-Aignan]] holding the Blue Ribbon with the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]].]]
The origin of the school name may come from the French Royal and Catholic ''[[Order of the Holy Spirit|Ordre des Chevaliers du Saint Esprit]]''. This was a select group of the French Nobility that had been [[knight]]ed. The first creation of Royal Knights at the French Court was performed in 1576. The French Order of the Holy Spirit was for many centuries the most important highest distinction of the French Kingdom. Each member was awarded the [[Order of the Holy Spirit|Cross of the Holy Spirit]], which hung from a blue silk ribbon.  According to one story, this group became known for its extravagant and luxurious banquets, known as "''cordons bleus''". 
At the time of the [[French Revolution]], the monarchy and the Order were abolished, but the name remained synonymous with the excellent French cooking. Another theory has it that the blue ribbon simply became synonymous with excellence, and this was later applied to other fields such as cooking.&lt;ref name= brief /&gt;

The name was adopted by a French culinary magazine, ''[[La Cuisinière Cordon Bleu]]'', founded by [[Marthe Distel]] in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name= brief&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/restaurant/history.html |title=A Brief History |author= Le Cordon Bleu |publisher=Ibiblio.org |date= | accessdate= 2012-01-23}} correlates to accounts in the school's introductory text of ''Le Cordon Bleu at Home'' and other books.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine began offering lessons by some of the best chefs in France. This grew to become a cooking school that opened in [[Paris]] in 1895 and which became recognized as one of the most elite cooking schools in the world. The school closed during the German occupation of Paris (1940–44). After the war, [[Madame Elisabeth Brassart]] relaunched the school both on [[rue du Faubourg Saint Honoré]] in Paris and at the Chateau de Montjean.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Brassart managed the school until 1984; at the age of 87 she retired. She sold the school to the previous owner, [[André J. Cointreau]], a descendant of both the [[Cointreau]] and [[Rémy Martin]] dynasties.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==International campuses==
In 1933, former student [[Dione Lucas]] helped to open a school under the Le Cordon Bleu name in [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adgitadiaries.blog-city.com/dione_lucas_and_lecole_du_cordon_bleu.htm |title=Dione Lucas - A tribute |publisher=Adgitadiaries.blog-city.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219113315/http://adgitadiaries.blog-city.com/dione_lucas_and_lecole_du_cordon_bleu.htm |archivedate=2012-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, shortly after buying Le Cordon Bleu, Cointreau&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cordonbleu.edu/about/en A message from school president André J.

Le Cordon Bleu was due to open its first rural outpost with partner UCOL in [[Martinborough]], [[New Zealand]] in early 2009, but the deal fell through, causing controversy there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.times-age.co.nz/localnews/storydisplay.cfm?storyid=3771649&amp;thesection=localnews&amp;thesubsection=&amp;thesecondsubsection= Wairarapa Times-Age: UCOL pulls plug on cuisine school] {{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, more than 20,000 students attend a Cordon Bleu school each year. 

===United States closure===

In the [[United States]], 16 schools operated under the "Le Cordon Bleu North America" name through a licensing agreement with [[Career Education Corporation]] (CEC), a for-profit education company based in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;ref name=lcbusa&gt;[https://www.cordonbleu.edu/usa/home/en Cordonbleu.edu/usa:  Official Le Cordon Bleu USA website]. accessed 21 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ined/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordonbleu.edu/lcb-usa/en |title=Le Cordon Bleu schools in the U.S |publisher=cordonbleu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the license was estimated to be worth $135 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.careered.com/press-room/press-releases/culinary/cec-announces-purchase-of-lcb-brand&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in light of the gainful employment rules implemented by the US Department of Education in 2015, CEC, which owned and operated the US schools, made the decision to sell the 16 campuses. When they failed to find a buyer&lt;ref name=ined/&gt;&lt;ref name=discont&gt;[https://www.cordonbleu.edu/usa/home/en Cordonbleu.edu/usa: Le Cordon Bleu USA discontinuing in the USA acknowledgment]. accessed 21 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=davis&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Janel|title=Le Cordon Bleu culinary colleges for sale|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local-education/le-cordon-bleu-culinary-colleges-for-sale/njXNn/|accessdate=January 22, 2015|work=ajc.com|publisher=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; they announced on 16 December 2015 that they will close all 16 Cordon Bleu campuses in the United States teaching out the program through September 2017.&lt;ref name=discont/&gt;&lt;ref name=usclosure&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Le-Cordon-Bleu-to-End-Culinary-Classes-in-US-362705821.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219040742/http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Le-Cordon-Bleu-to-End-Culinary-Classes-in-US-362705821.html |archivedate=2015-12-19 |df= }} |Retrieved December 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ined&gt;[https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/12/17/career-ed-closing-down-le-cordon-bleu-operations Inside Higher Ed Blog: "Career Ed Corp Closing Down Le Cordon Bleu Operations"], 17 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Classic Cycle and other programs==
Le Cordon Bleu is renowned for its Classic Cycle program that dates back to its founding at the start of the 20th century. This is the foundation program that continue to offer at their international campuses. 

The Classic Cycle offered at a majority of the international campuses consists of six courses taught at three succeeding levels;  three in "[[cuisine]]" and three in "[[pâtisserie]]" (pastry making). Each course leads to the award of a certificate at basic, intermediate, or advanced level. Students who complete all three levels in the same field are awarded the ''Diplôme de Cuisine'' or the ''Diplôme de Pâtisserie''. Those who complete all six courses are awarded the ''Grand Diplôme''. The "Grand Diplome" is one of the few culinary credentials that signify mastery of both pastry and culinary fundamentals.

Since the mid-1990s, Le Cordon Bleu has been offering hospitality management degrees with up to 2000 students studying bachelor's or master's degrees level. Master's degrees are offered in Korea and Australia as well as an online degree in [[gastronomy]] tourism. Their Bachelor programs in Hotel Management, Restaurant Management, Food Entrepreneurship and Wine Entrepreneurship programs are delivered in France, Mexico, Australia, Peru, and Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.cordonbleu.edu/programs/en |title=Le Cordon Bleu course information |publisher=cordonbleu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the CEC-run schools, each Cordon Bleu school offers its own list of culinary short courses open to the public, matching local demand. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In addition to its growing network of schools and programs, Le Cordon Bleu has an active products program through the publication of [[cookbooks]], select food items and a line of [[kitchenware]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

== Modern issues ==
[[File:Paris 06 2012 Cordon Bleu 3149.jpg|thumb|Le Cordon Bleu school in [[Paris]]]]
Following Cointreau's purchase of the school, Le Cordon Bleu began to clamp down on unauthorized use of its name. As one example, in 2006, Cordon Bleu threatened legal action against a small family-owned restaurant in [[Ste. Anne, Manitoba|Ste. Anne]], [[Manitoba]], Canada, for [[trademark]] infringement. Although the restaurant had been operating under the name "Cordon Bleu" since 1963, and the owners asserted that no one could have mistakenly believed any connection between their "little hick restaurant" with the corporate giant, they felt that taking the issue to court would have bankrupted them. As a result, the Ste. Anne owners agreed to change their name and reached an undisclosed settlement with the larger company to pay for new signage and other costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/01/23/4788548-sun.html Cordon Bleu sues Manitoba eatery], ''[[Winnipeg Sun]]'', January 23, 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20080125115536/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2008/01/23/4788548-sun.html |date=January 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a student at the London school reportedly pulled out a chef's knife and threatened to kill himself after being told that he'd failed his Basic Cuisine exam. London papers reported that the ordeal led to a four-hour standoff with police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Neil |last= Sears |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1024366/Cookery-school-siege-chef-threatens-kill-failing-exam.html |title=Cookery school siege standoff |work= Daily Mail |date=2008-06-06 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, another student, who had spent her life savings of £40,000 in fees for the course, sued the college citing constant criticism, bullying, a money making attitude, and unfairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Alison |last= Smith-Squire |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4146556/How-lemon-tart-bullies-ruined-40-000-Cordon-Bleu-dream.html |work= Daily Mail |date=2017-01-23 |accessdate=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In books and films ==
In her memoir ''[[My Life in France]]'' (Knopf), [[Julia Child]], aided by her husband's great-nephew [[Alex Prud'homme]], discusses her experiences attending the school in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, William. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/08/books/review/08grim.html?ex=1302148800&amp;en=3dbb83414e8ab2e8&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss "Julia Child's Memoir of When French was Scary"], ''The New York Times'', 8 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This is one part of Julia Child's life portrayed in the feature film ''[[Julie &amp; Julia]]'' (2009).

Le Cordon Bleu culinary school served as the set for the [[Sabrina (1954 film)|1954 movie “Sabrina,”]] in which Audrey Hepburn's character attends the famous French cooking school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allculinaryschools.com/articles/le-cordon-bleu-culinary-school/|title=5 Things About Le Cordon Bleu Culinary School {{!}} All Culinary Schools|work=All Culinary Schools|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, an American writer, [[Kathleen Flinn]], wrote ''[[The Sharper Your Knife, the Less You Cry]]'', the first insider's account of attending the modern Paris flagship school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flinn |first=Kathleen |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15732097 |title=NPR's Talk of the Nation: 'The Sharper Your Knife, the Less You Cry' |publisher=NPR.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flinn's best-selling memoir recounts the modern day-to-day trials of the program, and provides a further history of the school. The film rights for Flinn's book were purchased by the TV division of [[20th Century Fox]]; an adaptation is expected to be filmed in [[Paris]]. Another book about attending Le Cordon Bleu was published in 2008 in the United Kingdom, ''Sacré Cordon Bleu: What the French Know About Cooking'' by [[Michael Booth]] (Jonathan Cape). Like Flinn's book, it also features numerous classic French recipes.
[[File:London 12 2012 Le Cordon Bleu 4939.JPG|thumb|Le Cordon Bleu school in [[London]]]]

In 1991, Le Cordon Bleu published its first English-language cookbook, ''Le Cordon Bleu at Home''. As printed in the inside cover, the book: {{cquote|provides a solid understanding of the philosophy and skills taught for nearly a century in the school's nine-month 'Classic Cycle' course. Moving through three stages, from basic to advanced techniques, this approach to classical French cuisine offers a series of menus and recipes that correspond to classes at the school. Nearly three hundred color photographs depict finished dishes, serving ideas, and cooking techniques at each stage through completion.}}

'''Lois Graham''' (known early in her career as '''Lois Graham McDowell''' or '''Lois G. McDowell''') (1925 – November 4, 2013) was a professor of [[thermodynamics]] and [[cryogenics]]. She was the first woman to earn a mechanical engineering [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.rpi.edu/luwakkey/129|title=Edwards, New York Resident Lois Graham Inducted into Rensselaer's Alumni Hall of Fame|last=Jenkins|first=Caroline|date=2003-10-03|website=|publisher=[[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|RPI]] News|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120222238/https://news.rpi.edu/luwakkey/129|archive-date=2018-11-20|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://northcountrynow.com/news/canton-woman-nominated-womens-history-honoree-being-first-woman-country-earn-doctorate-aerospac|title=Canton woman nominated as women's history honoree for being first woman in country to earn doctorate in aerospace engineering {{!}} NorthCountryNow|last=|first=|date=2013-02-01|publisher=North Country Now|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120221418/http://northcountrynow.com/news/canton-woman-nominated-womens-history-honoree-being-first-woman-country-earn-doctorate-aerospac|archive-date=2018-11-20|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham is remembered for her lifelong work recruiting young women into careers in science and engineering. She taught for nearly 40 years in the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]'s Mechanical, Materials and Aerospace Engineering program. Graham founded IIT's Women in Science and Engineering program, which recruited female high school students into science and engineering careers.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://alumni.iit.edu/alumni-awards-2015-graham|title=Alumni Awards 2015: Lifetime Achievement Award: Lois Graham (M.S.

== Early life and education ==
Graham was born in 1925 and grew up in Troy, NY, one of three siblings. She initially wanted to be a doctor but could not afford medical school. An admirer of [[Amelia Earhart]], Graham also wanted to be a pilot or flight attendant, but those professions at the time had height limitations of 5'3" and weight limitations of 125 pounds. "Well, unfortunately," Graham said in an interview, "I outgrew that career."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ethw.org/Oral-History:Lois_Graham|title=Dr. Lois Graham: An interview conducted by Lauren Kata for the Society of Women Engineers, June 6, 2003|last=Kata|first=Lauren|date=2003-06-06|website=[[Society of Women Engineers]]|language=en|via=[[Engineering and Technology History Wiki]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120222620/https://ethw.org/Oral-History:Lois_Graham|archive-date=2018-11-20|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interested in aviation, Graham considered [[aerospace engineering]], but as with medical school, she could not afford the tuition.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ===
By the time she graduated high school in the spring of 1942, Graham had settled on attending a [[Public university|state college]] for teachers  in nearby Albany, NY. That summer, [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI), where Graham's father taught, announced that it would admit female students for the first time, and children of employees could attend for free. Graham enrolled, first attending summer classes, and then enrolling full-time, one of the first four women to be admitted. She followed an accelerated schedule that was available during World War II. Graham became one of the first two women to graduate with a degree at RPI (Class of 1946), and the first woman from the university to graduate with a degree in mechanical engineering.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YeO2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Girls Coming to Tech!: A History of American Engineering Education for Women|last=Bix|first=Amy Sue|date=2014-01-31|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=|isbn=9780262320276|location=Cambridge, MA, USA|pages=111|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120051247/https://books.google.com/books?id=YeO2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-date=2018-11-20|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illinois Institute of Technology ===
After graduating from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Graham worked as a test engineer at the [[Carrier Corporation]], leaving after 18 months to pursue a master's degree. According to Graham, she was turned away by [[MIT]] (who requested "every single textbook I had used when I was in college and every portion of that textbook I had covered"), [[CalTech]] (who sent her a postcard stating, "We do not accept women"), and the [[University of Illinois]] (who told her, "we cannot accept out-of-state students at this time"), but was offered a [[Teaching assistant|teaching assistantship]] by the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (IIT).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Quote|text=I was at Carrier for a year and a half, and I think after about a year I was starting to get bored. I didn’t feel I had enough responsibility. And so I talked to my immediate boss and told him that. And he said, “Well, you’re too young.” Too young? (Laughs) Well, I don’t know whether that was the real reason or not, but in any case, I figured, all right, I’m going to go back to school and get older.|sign=Lois Graham|source=2003 SWE interview&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;}}

== Career ==
[[File:Lois G. McDowell Woman Engineer.png|thumb|1953 photograph of Lois Graham in ''Popular Science''|alt=|left]]In 1949, Graham became the first female faculty member in IIT's engineering department, and the first female graduate student accepted into its Mechanical, Materials and Aerospace Engineering program. IIT had to make an adjustment upon her arrival: converting a small closet into a ladies restroom. Later that year, Graham earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering, the first woman at IIT to do so.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;

Even early in her career, Graham received attention for being a woman in a male-dominated field. In September 1953, Graham was featured in [[Popular Science]], which ran a picture of her, identified as "Lois G. McDowell," with the caption:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bi0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;hl=&amp;amp;source=gbs_api|title=Popular Science|last=Corporation|first=Bonnier|date=September 1953|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=159|language=en|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Bi0DAAAAMBAJ/page/n161|archive-date=2015-01-22|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SWE and ''Women in Engineering'' ===
[[File:Society of Women Engineers 1953.jpg|thumb|1953 Society of Women Engineers board meeting; Lois Graham is standing, on the right]]Graham was a fellow life member of the [[Society of Women Engineers]], which she joined in 1952, two years after it was founded. At SWE, Graham's worked focused on increasing the number of women pursuing careers in engineering, science, and math. She wrote articles published by SWE advocating for improving the career counseling available to young women, and for increasing the recruitment of young women into the engineering field in order to end a shortage of engineers in the country. To bolster her arguments, Graham marshaled allies by citing other influential people, from outside academia, who had spoken favorably about women in engineering. For example, in one article, Graham employed a quote by [[Arthur Sherwood Flemming]] (then the Director of the [[Office of Defense Mobilization]], and later US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare), in which he said, "[W]e haven't got a chance in the world of taking care of that deficit of engineers . . . unless we get women headed in the direction of engineering schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDowell|first=Lois G.|date=September 1953|title=Professional Guidance and Education|url=|journal=Journal of the [[Society of Women Engineers]]|volume=|page=2-5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham argued that young women could not only help themselves, but also help their country, by pursuing careers in engineering.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=The Educational Work of Women’s Organizations, 1890–1960|last=Puaca|first=Laura Michelitti|date=2008-03-18|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year=|isbn=9780230610125|editor-last=Knupfer|editor-first=A.|location=New York|pages=68|language=en|chapter=Cold War Women: Professional Guidance, National Defense, and the Society of Women Engineers|editor-last2=Woyshner|editor-first2=C.|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OoOHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121053121/https://books.google.com/books?id=OoOHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-date=2018-11-21|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSOiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Searching for Scientific Womanpower: Technocratic Feminism and the Politics of National Security, 1940-1980|last=Puaca|first=Laura Micheletti|date=2014-06-02|publisher=[[UNC Press Books]]|year=|isbn=9781469610825|location=|pages=75|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121175158/https://books.google.com/books?id=PSOiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-date=2018-11-21|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://societyofwomenengineers.swe.org/component/content/article/?id=129&amp;Itemid=78|title=Lois Graham, 1925–2013|last=|first=|date=2008-03-21|website=Society of Women Engineers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham served as SWE's fourth national president from 1955 until 1956. In 1955, SWE released a 40-page report entitled ''Women in Engineering'', aimed at influencing how female engineers were viewed by the public. Graham has said in an interview that an early title under consideration for the booklet was "Petticoats and Slide Rules."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The report listed accredited engineering programs, their curricula and prerequisites. It also included information about scholarships for women, statistics about women in the engineering field, and suggested reading lists. SWE distributed the ''Women in Engineering'' booklet to over 400 high schools around the United States, as well as colleges and universities, corporations and government agencies, and engineering societies. Ultimately, the enthusiastic response led to SWE running out of copies of ''Women in Engineering'', and a new edition was issued in 1958.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://societyofwomenengineers.swe.org/k-12-outreach/high-school-resources/2-uncategorised/42-lois-graham|title=SWE Pioneer - Lois Graham|last=|first=|date=2016-08-19|publisher=[[Society of Women Engineers]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First woman in US to earn mechanical engineering PhD ===
In 1959, Graham was awarded a PhD by IIT and became the first US woman to earn a mechanical engineering PhD.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; Her doctoral work focused on the field of combustion,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and her dissertation thesis was entitled ''Effect of adding a combustible to atmosphere and surrounding diffusion flame''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Graham|first=Lois|title=Effect of adding a combustible to atmosphere surrounding diffusion flame|date=1959|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/effect-of-adding-a-combustible-to-atmosphere-surrounding-diffusion-flame/oclc/45226021|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Graham became assistant director for Engineering and Science. The following year, she was promoted to full professor, a rare rank for a woman to hold at the time.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In 1977, she was named Program Director for IIT's Education and Experience in Engineering Program. She also served as the Director of IIT's Minorities in Engineering Program. In 1979, she was listed as a [[NSF-GRF|National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eZQrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Lois+Graham%22+mechanical+engineering&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WmufkeTBzN&amp;sig=uWV8YXG0aeX87ofUbDxn9p5lKYA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifiIntmeLeAhUinOAKHVVXDK44ChDoATAIegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lois%20Graham%22%20mechanical%20engineering&amp;f=false|title=Annual Report on Awards|last=Resources|first=National Research Council (U S. ) Commission on Human|last2=Personnel|first2=National Research Council (U S. ) Office of Scientific and Engineering|first3=|date=1979|publisher=National Academies|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120230527/https://books.google.com/books?id=eZQrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Lois+Graham%22+mechanical+engineering&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WmufkeTBzN&amp;sig=uWV8YXG0aeX87ofUbDxn9p5lKYA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifiIntmeLeAhUinOAKHVVXDK44ChDoATAIegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lois%20Graham%22%20mechanical%20engineering&amp;f=false|archive-date=2018-11-20|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, she received the IIT Professional Achievement Award, and in 1991, the IIT Julie Beveridge Award.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;

=== IIT's Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) Program ===
In 1981, Graham founded IIT's Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program. WISE employed women engineers in the private, public, and academic sectors, as well as graduate and undergraduate students, to engage directly with female high school students in order to increase enrollment of women into college engineering programs. WISE has a three-prong approach: encouraging high school girls in a supportive environment to pursue what are today termed [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] careers; engaging them in hands-on activities that expose them to various math- and science- related fields; and preparing them to pursue an undergraduate engineering degree by advising on course selection, college applications, and similar matters. Fall, winter, and summer programs were offered, usually free of charge, in which female high school students attended college lectures, networked with engineering students, faculty, and professionals, and participated in hands-on projects inside and outside of the laboratory, such as building a generator or planning a moon colony. WISE also educated parents, teachers, and counselors about the opportunities available to young women to pursue math and science careers.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J17WAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22lois+graham%22+engineer&amp;dq=%22lois+graham%22+engineer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE9JqP0eTeAhWNTN8KHUCsBMs4ChDoAQhIMAc|title=Women in Engineering Conference: A National Initiative, Conference Proceedings : Holiday Inn--Crowne Plaza, Washington, D.C., May 30-June 1, 1990|last=Taylor|first=Beth|date=1990|publisher=Purdue University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=119–124|language=en|chapter=Encouraging high school girls' interests in math and science|chapter-url=https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57499/57187|chapter-format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121061232/https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57499/57187|archive-date=2018-11-21|dead-url=no|via=[[Penn State]] Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retirement ==
After 39 years at IIT, Graham retired in 1985 and moved back to upstate New York.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; On December 8, 1999, Graham was awarded the Person of the Millennium award by IIT students,&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; an award, Graham said, she "prized above all others."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

On June 6, 2003, Graham was interviewed for SWE's Oral History Project.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On September 19, 2003, Graham was inducted to the RPI Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Graham died on November 4, 2013, at the age of 88. An obituary in ''Watertown Daily Times'' wrote, "To her beloved grandchildren she was simply 'Grandma Lois.' But to thousands of female mechanical engineers in this country, she was a pioneer and role model."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In 2010–2011, Graham was an [[American Association of University Women]] named scholarship honoree.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stlawrence.aauw-nys.org/inhonor.htm|title=In Honor:  Lois Graham, 2010-11 Named Scholarship Honoree (1925-2013)|last=Briggs|first=Kay|date=|publisher=[[American Association of University Women]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120221634/http://stlawrence.aauw-nys.org/inhonor.htm|archive-date=2018-11-20|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also nominated to be a [[National Women's History Project]] National Women's History Month honoree in 2013.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwhp.org/womens-history-month/past-womens-history-months/2013-honorees/|title=2013 Honorees|last=|first=|date=|website=[[National Women's History Project]]|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120230637/http://www.nwhp.org/womens-history-month/past-womens-history-months/2013-honorees/|archive-date=2018-11-20|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Graham was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by IIT.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;

== Impact and legacy ==

The '''Malcolm Knapp Research Forest''' is located in the [[Coast Mountains]], about 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Vancouver]], in [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia]]. The forest is approximately 5,157 hectares and has many different types of terrain. The forest is home to some 400-year-old trees, though the vast majority of trees are 70–120 years old. It was a site of major logging from the 1800s to 1931, but was officially established as the UBC/Malcolm Knapp Research Forest in 1949 because of the major influence from the late UBC professor [[Malcolm Knapp]]. Although today it is dedicated to research and education, it is also a popular destination for trail hiking and camps. 

__TOC__

==Historic influence and UBC research==

In 1922 when the forestry program at UBC was just two years old, [[Malcolm Knapp]], a professor of forestry, had a vision to conduct research for forestry. He taught courses on logging, wood technology and forestry products. At this time, the university only had a small forest on the edge of campus for research, so his influence was immense{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2015}} when the [[University of British Columbia]] took over management of the forest in 1949. His vision of having a large and vast forest became reality. This vision, along with his passion for [[salvage archaeology|salvaging]] and [[silviculture]] for the Forestry Program at UBC, was of great importance{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2015}} as his 41 years of service for the university ended in 1963. After his many years of service to the forest and the university, the Research Forest officially changed its name to Malcolm Knapp/UBC Research Forest in 1988, and then he died a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malcolm Knapp&amp;#124; History|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UBC also holds a spot at the top of one of the mountains for a [[liquid mirror telescope]] observatory (UBC LMTO). It was established in 1995 as part of development for liquid-mirror technology. The telescope overlooks the [[Fraser Valley]] and is far enough away from the city lights to provide a great{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2015}} research facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UBC LMTO|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/research/liquid-mirror-telescope/|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently{{When|date=June 2015}} 84 research projects going on at the forest, all related to riparian management, silviculture, wildlife, hydrology, ecology, and other applied science fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UBC Research Projects Database|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/research/research-projects-database/}}&lt;/ref&gt; UBC also releases annual reports in which one can see what is going on in the forest, what research they are conducting and any updates on projects. Staff changes, silviculture reports (including clear-cuts, thinning, etc.), along with major events for the forest are all summarized in these reports. Please see external links for archives.

==Ecology==

[[File:Old growth Douglas-fir, Malcolm Knapp Research Forest, BC, Canada.jpg|thumb]]

[[File:Blooming Skunk Cabbage.JPG|thumb]]

The forest is about {{convert|5,157|ha}}. It measures 13&amp;nbsp;km from west to east and 4&amp;nbsp;km north to south. It contains every type of terrain found on Coastal B.C which means that it has a wide variety of many plants, animals and trees. The highest elevation is in the north-east corner and is about 1000m above sea level in the [[Golden Ears (peaks)|Golden Ears Mountains]], and it spans down to sea level, touching [[Pitt Lake]]. Typically, the most precipitation that is seen at the forest is rain, which averages about 2200mm in the northern end of the forest. This end also receives snow in the winter. However, the south end is closer to sea level and receives around 3000mm of rain per year.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malcolm Knapp Research Forest|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/about/location-and-ecology/|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm Knapp Research Forest is categorized in the [[Biogeoclimatic zones of British Columbia|Coast Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic zone]], with the lower portion of the forest in the dry maritime subzone and the upper portion in the very wet maritime subzone. It has a vast collection of trees, plants and animals including [[Douglas fir]], [[western red cedar]], [[western hemlock]] and [[amabilis fir]] trees. The forest still has some patches of intact old growth forest that is over 400 years old, but since ongoing research is being done, some of the forest is as young as 40 years old, though most of the forest is covered in trees that are about 70 years old.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some other trees and plants you can find are [[bigleaf maple]], [[vine maple]], [[Lysichiton americanus|skunk cabbage]] (yellow flower pictured beside), [[Oregon grape]], [[salmonberry]], and many ferns like [[Polystichum munitum|sword fern]] and [[Dryopteris expansa|spiny wood fern]].

==Recreation==
[[File:Trails at Malcolm Knapp.JPG|thumb]]
The maximum trail length is about 8&amp;nbsp;km; that will take the average hiker around 3 hours to walk. The trails at Malcolm Knapp are categorized as an intermediate hike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vancouver Trails &amp;#124; UBC Malcolm Knapp|url=http://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/ubc-malcolm-knapp-research-forest/|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Malcolm Knapp hiking===
[[File:Markers.JPG|thumb]]
The south part of Malcolm Knapp Research Forest has an abundance of trails which are all colour coded into Red, Green, Yellow, and blue, with red being the easiest and blue being the hardest. Please see external links for a map of the trails.

===Loon Lake hiking===
The Loon Lake Trail is for guests of Loon Lake Research and Education Centre wishing to embark on this 6&amp;nbsp;km hike. Please see external links for a map of the trails.

====Loon Lake Research and Education Center====

On the trails at Loon Lake, there is a research and education center. Loon Lake is the largest lake in the forest, which has its own trail around the lake that will take about 6 hours to complete as it is 6&amp;nbsp;km in length. The lake opened an outdoor education camp in 2000, and now provides an area for forestry and environmental education, as well as outdoor recreation with activities such as:&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Loon Lake Lodge and Retreat Center|url=http://loonlake.ubc.ca/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Canoe &amp; Water Adventures
* SKY Helicopter Tours
* Eco-Tours and Hiking
* Inspired Learning educational programs
* Pinnacle Pursuits
* Rock-climbing, rappelling, high/low ropes, team building

====Camp Goodtimes====
Loon Lake also houses Camp Goodtimes, a summer recreation program for children and teens affected by cancer and their families. It is divided into six weeks throughout July and August: four weeks for kids' camp, one week for teen, and one week for family. It is held at Loon Lake at no cost to participants. Camp Goodtimes is accredited by the [[British Columbia Camping Association]] and the [[Canadian Association of Pediatric Oncology Camps]] (CAPOC).&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6459">The '''National Classification of Levels of Training''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Nomenclature des niveaux de formation'') is a system used in [[France]] for statistical purposes to measure an individual's training. Two classifications are commonly used:&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.education.gouv.fr/cid23200/definitions-des-termes-indicateurs-statistiques-education-nationale.html#N Les définitions des termes et indicateurs statistiques de l'éducation nationale - Niveau de formation]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nomenclature des niveaux de formation'' (national classification of levels of training),&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.insee.fr/fr/methodes/default.asp?page=definitions/niveaux-formation.htm Insee - Définitions et méthodes - Niveaux de formation]&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1969 by the ''Commission statistique nationale'' (national statistical commission), and the [[International Standard Classification of Education]] (ISCED), validated by [[UNESCO]] in 1997 and used for international comparisons.

The first one is used by the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of National Education]], but also by the French [[employment agency]], to classify jobseekers by education level, and by [[INSEE]] for the census,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.recensement.insee.fr/chiffresCles.action?zoneSearchField=FRANCE&amp;codeZone=M-METRODOM&amp;idTheme=1 France métropolitaine - Thême « Diplômes - Formation »]&lt;/ref&gt; ...

The issue of classification reform arises from [[Bologna Process|European degrees harmonization]], including the phasing of final diplomas of undergraduate higher education (level III). However, even after the phasing, there are still many graduates. Thus, although the ''[[Certificat d'études primaires]]'' was officially abolished in 1989, which does not prevent to find today, in the French population, individuals who had stopped at this level of training.{{clarify|date=May 2012}}

== National classification of levels of training (1967) ==
It defines the levels of training in terms of duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.paysdelaloire.fr/uploads/tx_oxcsnewsfiles/Nomenclature_des_niveaux_de_formation.pdf Nomenclature des niveaux de formation]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Level VI ===

Staff with a job which not requires training beyond compulsory schooling.

=== Level V Bis ===

Staff with a job assuming a specialized training for a maximum of one year beyond the first cycle of secondary education, level of the ''certificat de formation professionnelle'' (vocational training certificate).

=== Level V ===

Staff with a job normally requiring a level of training equivalent to the ''Brevet d'études professionnelles'' (BEP) (two years of education beyond the first cycle of secondary education) and to the ''Certificat d'aptitude professionnelle'' (CPC ). Provisionally, the training of the [[National diploma (France)|National diploma]] acquired.

=== Level IV ===

==== IV a ====

Staff with a job normally requiring a [[Baccalauréat]], a ''brevet de technician'' (BT), a ''brevet supérieur d'enseignement commercial'' (BSEC) (three years of education beyond the first cycle of secondary education) . Provisionally, a ''brevet d'enseignement industrial'' (EIB), a ''brevet d'enseignement commercial'' (BEC).

==== IV b ====

Staff holding a ''brevet professionnel'' or a ''brevet de maîtrise'' (two years of training minimum and professional practice after acquiring a level V degree).

=== Level III ===

Staff with a job normally requiring training a ''Brevet de technician supérieur'' (technician's diploma), a ''Diplôme universitaire de technologie'', or end of the first cycle of higher education (three years of post-[[Baccalauréat|baccalaureat]] education since the reform aimed for a European harmonization of higher education)

=== Levels I and II ===

Staff with a job normally requiring training of equal or higher than that of the ''[[grandes écoles]]'' or [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]].

== National classification of levels of training (1969) ==

Built in reference to the one of 1967, this classification refers to a skill level (responsibility in employment).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.cncp.gouv.fr/gcp/pages/cache/offonce/lang/fr/Accueil35701/Glossaire?lettreCourante=N Niveau(x)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Level V ===

Staff with a job normally requiring a level of training equivalent to the ''brevet d'études professionnelles'' (BEP) or the ''certificat d'aptitude professionnelle'' (CAP), and by equivalence, of the ''certificat de formation professionnelle des adultes'' (CFPA).

This level corresponds to a full qualification for the practice of a specific activity, with the ability to use instruments and techniques relating thereto. This activity involves chiefly the performance of a work which may be independently conduct within the limits of the techniques related thereto.

=== Level IV ===

Staff with a jobs of control or highly skilled worker and can attest a level of training equivalent to that of the ''brevet professionel'' (BP), the ''brevet de technicien'' (BT), a ''Baccalauréat professionel'' or a ''Baccalauréat technologique''.

A degree of level IV requires more theoretical knowledge than the previous level. This activity involves chiefly technical work which can be performed independently and/or entail executive coaching (control).

=== Level III ===

Staff with a jobs that normally requires a ''Diplôme universitaire de technologie'' (DUT) or a ''Brevet de technicien supérieur'' (BTS) or end of undergraduate higher education.
A degree of Level III corresponds to the knowledge and skills level, though lacking the knowledge of the scientific basis of the areas concerned. Capabilities and knowledge required ensure to be able to work autonomously or independently  responsibilities of design and/or coaching and/or management.

=== Level II ===

Staff with a [[middle management]] job that normally requires a training of a [[Bachelor's degree]] level or a first-year [[Master's degree]] level.

At this level, the practice of an employment contract or independent means knowing the scientific foundations of the job, generally leading to autonomy in carrying out this activity.

=== Level I ===

Staff with a [[middle management]] job that normally requires a training above the first-year [[Master's degree]] level.

In addition to strong knowledge of scientific basis of the job, a level I requires knowledge of process design and research.

The '''National Tournament of Academic Excellence''' (NTAE) (formerly known as the '''Panasonic Academic Challenge''' [PAC]) is a national high school academic competition run by the [[Florida Department of Education]]. The tournament resembles the Florida's own [[Commissioner's Academic Challenge]], which is a type of [[quiz bowl]] format. The NTAE had been run in June starting in 1988. Sponsorship from [[Panasonic]] ended in 2008 and after 2009 the tournament was not held for several years until was it revived again in 2014.

== Match Format ==

The format used in the NTAE is unique among all other national tournaments, and is based on the format used for the [[Commissioner's Academic Challenge]], which is Florida's quizbowl state tournament for [[List of school districts in Florida|school districts]]. This is also the tournament used to select the team that represents Florida at the NTAE.

While most tournaments involve two teams playing in a head-to-head format, the NTAE involves matches of between four and six teams playing against each other in the same competition room. Each team starts with 100 points.

Each match is divided into three untimed periods. The first period consists of 20 questions, each worth five points. The second period consists of 20 questions, each worth ten points, and the final round consists of 25 questions, each worth fifteen points. Each question has a one-minute time limit in which teams may answer. Teams answering incorrectly are penalized the point value of the question. A team is eliminated from competition if their point total reaches zero, but this a very rare occurrence.

At the end of each period, each team participates in a written team question which has a variable time limit, and a variable number of questions. The written team question after each of the three periods is worth (respectively) a maximum of ten, twenty, and thirty points. There are no penalties for incorrect answers in this phase of the competition. These written questions are non-competitive, and each team may earn the maximum number of points.

At the end of each match, teams are ranked according to their point totals. A tie-breaker occurs only if a tie results among teams that will be advancing to a future match.

Aside from the written team questions, there are no bonus questions which are prevalent in most other quizbowl formats. There is also the absence of "rebounding" a missed question. That is, once a question is attempted, whether the answer given is correct or incorrect, the question ends, and no other team is given the opportunity to answer.

Adding to the challenge, each team is permitted only one button to indicate they are ready to answer, and to lock out other teams from responding (aka "buzzer"). Most other formats allow each player to have their own buzzer.

== Topic and Question Formats ==

The questions used in the NTAE are wholly unique among national tournaments. Unlike most other tournaments there are multiple choice and matching questions, some of which can be deceptively difficult. There are also "fill-in-the-blank style questions," as well as free response questions (standard to high school quizbowl).

While topics range across the academic canon, there is an overall de-emphasis of pop culture questions, and a marked increase in the number of mathematics questions (teams are provided calculators). Foreign language is also utilized often, with teams usually choosing from amongst French or Spanish questions (in the past, German and Latin were options, but these have been discontinued).

There are also visual questions displayed on a television monitor, and audio questions played from recordings. While these two question formats can be used for any question category, audio questions are most often used for music and foreign language questions, while video questions are most often used for art questions.

== Tournament Format ==

The tournament is usually held during the second or third week of June, starting on a Sunday, and ending on a Tuesday. The tournament is usually held at the convention center of the [[Disney's Contemporary Resort|Contemporary Resort Hotel]] at [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Orlando, Florida]].

Teams are randomly assigned to a first round match (historically, each first round match has either four or five teams in each competition room). Winning teams automatically advance to the semifinals. Teams not winning in the first round are randomly assigned to a consolation match, and compete on Monday. Winners of each consolation match also advance to the semifinals.

There are usually three semifinal matches played on Tuesday morning. The top two teams from each semifinal advance to the championship round, held on Tuesday afternoon.

Coaches are not permitted to challenge the game officials, though players are permitted to do so. Each match generally has at least one judge who is a specialist in each academic area.

== Team Qualifications ==
An unusual feature of this tournament is that teams do not necessarily qualify based on performance during the past season, as is the case in most other national quizbowl tournaments. The Board of Education (or equivalent body) of each U.S. state and territory is given the power to select a team in any way they see fit. Some teams come from a single school, and are usually the quizbowl champion of that state.  In other cases, the Board of Education gives selection power to a committee who chooses an all-star team from among that state's best players. Thus each state or territory can enter only one team, and is referred to at the tournament as (for example) Team Alabama or Team Oklahoma.

== Sponsorship &amp; Prizes ==

Another unique fixture of this tournament are the resources committed by corporate and government sponsorship. Since its inception, the tournament has been sponsored by the school systems of the Florida counties of [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas]] and [[Polk County, Florida|Polk]], with the Florida Department of Education joining in the tournament's third year. [[Herff Jones]] has also been sponsors since the first year of the tournament. Other past corporate sponsors have included [[Publix Supermarkets]] and [[Disney]].

From 1992 to 2008, [[Panasonic]] was the title sponsor of the event. The [[Pepsi]] Bottling Group was also a longtime sponsor.

This corporate sponsorship allows for one of the largest prize packages in high school quizbowl. The top six teams each earn trophies, which are sent to the governors of the respective states or territories. The members of each of the top three teams earn scholarships ($2000, $1000, and $500 per team member, respectively), and earn championship rings. An "all-tournament" team is selected based on geography and individual performance in the first round of competition. These players earn medals and scholarship money.

'''''O''''' is a 2001 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]], and a [[List of modernized retellings of old stories|modern adaptation]] of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'', set in an American high school. It stars [[Mekhi Phifer]] and [[Josh Hartnett]].

The film's intended release date was April 1999, but due to the [[Columbine High School massacre]], the film was shelved for two years by its original distributor, [[Miramax Films]]. Ultimately, it was sold along with director [[Kevin Smith]]'s film ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'' to [[Lionsgate]]. It was directed by [[Tim Blake Nelson]] and written by Brad Kaaya. It contains many different styles of music, ranging from [[Rap music|rap]] to [[opera]]. It was filmed in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].

==Plot==
During a high school basketball game, Odin James ([[Mekhi Phifer]]) scores the basket that wins the game for his team. Later at an awards ceremony, the coach, Duke Goulding ([[Martin Sheen]]) presents the [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] award to Odin for his efforts, an award he shares with his teammate Michael Cassio ([[Andrew Keegan]]). In giving Odin the award, Duke passes over his son Hugo ([[Josh Hartnett]]), Odin's teammate and best friend. At a party celebrating the victory, Hugo plans with school outcast Roger Calhoun ([[Elden Henson]]) to go to the school's dean, Bob Brable ([[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]]) and tell him that Odin raped his daughter, Desi ([[Julia Stiles]]), whom Odin has been dating. Hugo promises Roger that Desi will be his after Odin is out of the way, but Roger is only a pawn in Hugo's ultimate plan to destroy Odin.

Later, in another game, Odin's team wins once again. At the celebration party, Hugo engineers a fight between Roger and a very drunk Michael, who is temporarily suspended from the team. Hugo tells Michael to ingratiate himself with Desi so that she will talk to Odin on his behalf. Soon afterward, Hugo tells Odin that Michael and Desi have been spending a lot of time together, and that she may be cheating on him. Odin doesn't believe this at first, but gradually comes to suspect them. Odin questions Desi, but she calms him down and he believes her. Nevertheless, the stress of the situation drives Odin to begin using drugs.

Hugo manipulates his girlfriend Emily ([[Rain Phoenix]]) into stealing a scarf for him that Odin had given to Desi. Hugo, in turn, gives it to Michael in hopes that Odin will believe that Desi gave Michael the scarf, and so is cheating on him.

Meanwhile, Odin and Desi are having sex at a motel, during which Odin sees an image of Michael on top of Desi in the mirror; angered, he becomes very rough with Desi, to the point that she cries out for him to stop, a plea he ignores as he continues to rape her. Afterward, they lie together staring in opposite directions.

After Odin assaults another student during a game in a drug-fueled rage, Hugo tells him about the scarf, convincing him that Desi is cheating on him. Enraged, Odin vows to kill her; Hugo then promises to kill Michael. Hugo, with Odin and Roger, plans to kill Michael and Desi. Hugo and Roger attempt to kill Michael in a [[carjacking]], but it does not go as planned: Roger and Michael struggle, Hugo hits Michael with a crowbar, knocking him unconscious. Roger shoots Michael in the leg, and then Hugo turns the gun on Roger and kills him after telling him that Desi is dead.

Odin and Desi are in Desi's room talking and Odin is pretending to make up with her. They are making out on the bed when suddenly Odin attacks her; Desi fights back, but he finally strangles her to death. Emily rushes into the room and sees Desi's corpse; she soon finds out what Hugo has done. She begins telling Odin that Hugo told her to steal the scarf and exposes his plot. Hugo shoots her when she refuses to be quiet, resulting in her death. Odin finally realizes that Hugo has been manipulating him the entire time, and demands to know why; Hugo refuses to answer. When the police arrive, Odin tells them what happened and commits [[suicide]]. As Hugo is taken into police custody, he says in voice over that he will have his day in the spotlight.

'''Quodlibet''' ([[Latin|lat.]]: "what pleases") is a traditional [[card game]] associated with central European [[Studentenverbindung|student fraternities]] that is played with [[William Tell deck|William Tell pattern cards]] and in which the dealer is known as the 'beer king'.&lt;ref name=Badenia&gt;[http://www.badenia.at/files/Sommersemester_94-2_Quodlibet.pdf "Quodlibet" in ''Badeneruf''] at www.badenia.at. Retrieved 31 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=frw&gt;[http://www.frw.or.at/Quodlibet.pdf ''Quodlibet''] at www.frw.or.at. Retrieved 31 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[compendium game|compendium]], [[trick-taking game]] for 4 players using a 32-card pack of [[double German playing cards]].&lt;ref name=Badenia/&gt; 

== History ==
Quodlibet is an old student drinking game which is described in an 1862 source as comprising around 20 different deals (''Touren'') each, in itself, almost childish, but collectively making for an enjoyable variety. The well known children's game, [[Schwarzer Peter]] (or [[Old Maid]] in Britain), was originally a Quodlibet deal.{{sfn|Lese-Stübchen|1862|p=238}}

== Overview ==
[[File:Wilhelm Tell na igraćim kartama.jpg|thumb|William Tell featured on the Ober of Acorns]]
Quolibet is a four-hander played with a pack of 32 German-suited cards that is popular with students.{{sfn|Kastner|Folkvord|2005|p=381}}

The rules given here are based on those used by two [[student fraternities]] from the [[Austria]]n region: KÖStV Frankonia Wien from [[Vienna]], founded in 1919, and KÖStV Badenia from [[Baden bei Wien]] in [[Lower Austria]], founded in 1928, both of which are members of the [[Mittelschüler-Kartellverband]], the umbrella organisation for all such high school fraternities in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frw.or.at/ ''KÖStV Frankonia Wien''] at www.frw.or.at. Retrieved 24 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badenia.at/ ''KÖStV Badenia''] at www.badenia.at. Retrieved 24 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[partie]]'' in Quodlibet consists of 12 games which, in some circles are divided into three 'wheels' (''Rädern'') or rounds, each of four deals (''Touren'').&lt;ref&gt;e.g. see [http://wuerstchenundbier.com/2671295f36e6735f.html ''Quodlibet''] at wuerstchenundbier.com; and [http://www.pasttimes.de/thema/kartenspiel-100 ''100 Karten''] at www.pasttimes.de. Retrieved 3 Oct 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Quodlibet is played anti-clockwise&lt;ref name=frw/&gt; and is a [[trick-taking game]] in which players must follow suit (''[[Farbzwang]]''), but there is no [[trump suit (cards)|trump suit]] or requirement to win the trick.&lt;ref name=Badenia/&gt;

The aim is to score as few penalty points as possible.&lt;ref name=frw/&gt;

The dealer in Quodlibet is called the 'beer king' (''Bierkönig''). The first beer king deals 8 cards to each player (normally 3-3-2 or 3-2-3), picks up his hand, chooses a contract from the first round (see below) and leads to the first trick.&lt;ref name=Badenia/&gt; When the first deal has been played out, the player to the dealer's right becomes the next beer king; he may now select one of the three remaining contracts and so on. 

At the end of each round, the player with the most penalty points becomes the new beer king and may select the first contract. The player with the fewest penalty points at the end of the ''partie'' is the winner.&lt;ref name=frw/&gt;

== Playing ==
=== First round  ===
The first round (''das erste Rad'') has the following contracts:

==== Plus ====
The aim is to win as many tricks as possible. Every trick that a player does not win scores 10 penalty points; if a player takes no tricks at all, he scores 100 penalty points – this is recorded with the [[Roman numerals|Roman number]] ''C''.&lt;ref name=frw/&gt;

==== Minus ====
The aim is to lose as many tricks as possible. Winning a trick costs 10 points; if a player takes all tricks, it costs 100 points.&lt;ref name=Badenia/&gt;&lt;ref name=frw/&gt;

==== Bad Neighbour ====
Bad Neighbour (''Böser Nachbar'') uses the same scoring as ''Minus'', but the penalty points go to the player on the right&lt;ref name=frw/&gt; (or left in another variant).&lt;ref name=Badenia/&gt;

==== Alarich ====
Alarich, also called Ahmed and the Red Ruffian (''Achmed und der rote Rülps''),&lt;ref name=frw/&gt; is a game in which the player who takes the 'Red Ruffian', i.e. the King of Hearts, in his tricks, scores 50 penalty points; the player who captures 'Ahmed', i.e. the Ober of Bells, scores 30 penalty points. If a player captures both in one trick, it costs 100 points.&lt;ref name=Badenia/&gt;

=== Second round  ===
The contracts in the second round (''das zweite Rad'') are:

==== First Three and Last ====
First Three and Last (''Erste drei, letzter'') is also called 1238, pronounced "Twelve Thirty-Eight" (''Zwölf Achtunddreißig''), or Wall (''Mauer''). 1238 is the [[Postleitzahl|post code]] of the [[Vienna|Viennese]] quarter of [[Mauer (Vienna)|Mauer]].&lt;ref name=Badenia/&gt;

Whoever takes the first trick scores 10 points. The second trick is worth 20 points, the third 30 and the last or eighth trick scores 50 (or 80) points.&lt;ref name=Badenia/&gt;

==== No Reds ====
Players aim to take no reds (''Keine Roten'') i.e. no Hearts cards in their tricks. The 'lower' Hearts (7 to 10) each score 20 points; the 'higher' ones (Unter to Deuce) each 10 points.&lt;ref name=Badenia/&gt; Taking all Hearts in one trick scores 100 points.&lt;ref name=Badenia/&gt;&lt;ref name=frw/&gt;

==== Ober/Unter ====
In Ober/Unter the aim is to avoid taking any Obers or Unters. Every Ober captured costs 30 points, every Unter 20 points. If a player takes an Ober and an Unter in the same trick, it costs 100 penalty points.&lt;ref name=Badenia/&gt;

==== Bribe ====
In Bribe (''Schmiergeld'') every trick scores 30 points and the player who plays the lowest card to the trick scores 20 points. If a player takes the trick with the lowest card, it costs 100 points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasttimes.de/thema/kartenspiel-100 ''Quodlibet''] at 100 Karten. Retrieved 3 Oct 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third round ===
In the third round (''das dritte Rad'') or Wheel of Fortune (''Glücksrad'') the beer king must announce his chosen contract before dealing.{{Cn|date=October 2018}}

==== Open Trousers ====
Open Trousers (''Offene Hose'') is negative contract in which the cards are held with their backs to the players, as in [[Skat (card game)|Idiotic Skat]]. For this contract, the requirement to follow suit is, of course, suspended. Each trick scores minus 10; taking all the tricks costs 100 penalty points.&lt;ref name=Badenia/&gt;

==== Good Hunting! ====
Good Hunting! (''Waidmannsheil'') is a negative game with open cards. Players lay their cards face up on the table for the duration of the contract and try to take as few tricks as possible. Every trick taken costs 10 penalty points; If a player takes all 8 tricks, it costs 100 points.&lt;ref name=Badenia/&gt;

==== Quadrature ====
Each player is dealt eight cards. A card is only beaten by the card of the same suit that is exactly three ranks higher. This card must be played and not cards that are four or more ranks higher. If someone plays a so-called Quadrature (''Quadratur''), e. g. an Eight and Unter of the same suit, the other players must play the Nine and Ten of that suit to the trick. Scoring is the same as in Snack below.&lt;ref name=frw/&gt;

==== Snack ====
Snack (''Kleinfraß'') is always played last. It is a variant of [[Sevens (card game)|Sevens]]. Every player is dealt 4 cards; five packets of 3 cards and a singleton are placed face down on the table.&lt;ref name=Badenia/&gt;

Initially only the Unters may be played. On an Unter, other cards may be built in the corresponding suit. If a player cannot meld any of his cards, he picks up a packet. Unters have to be played and must not be held back.&lt;ref name=Badenia/&gt;

As soon as the first player has laid all his cards out, he calls "Census!" and the first 'census' (''Volkszählung'') is held. The remaining players score 10 penalty points for each card still held.&lt;ref name=frw/&gt; 

The game continues. When the second player is 'out', the next census is taken. Each remaining card now costs 20 points. In the third census the player who still has hand cards receives 30 penalty points per card and must also count the packets remaining on the table.&lt;ref name=frw/&gt;

== Variations ==
Quodlibet is played in many variations that deviate in their details from the above description.  The 1888 ''Meyers Konversationslexikon'' describes Quodlibet as "''a card game that consists of 13'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[sic]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''different deals that is especially popular in student circles''".&lt;ref&gt;''Meyers Konversations-Lexikon (1888–1889)'', 4th completely revised edition. Bibliographisches Institut, Leipzig, p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- The rules are not binding in the same way as, for example, the rules of [[chess]].--&gt;

'''''Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books''''' is a [[book]] by [[Iran]]ian author and professor [[Azar Nafisi]]. Published in 2003, it was on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller list]] for over one hundred weeks and has been translated into 32 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Steven Barclay Agency: Azar Nafisi| url=http://www.barclayagency.com/nafisi.html | accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The book consists of a memoir of the author's experiences about returning to Iran during the [[Iranian Revolution|revolution (1978–1981)]] and living under the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] government until her departure in 1997. It narrates her teaching at the [[University of Tehran]] after 1979, her refusal to submit to the rule to wear the veil and her subsequent expulsion from the University, life during the [[Iran–Iraq War]], her return to teaching at the [[University of Allameh Tabatabei]] (1981), her resignation (1987), the formation of her book club (1995–97), and her decision to emigrate. Events are interlaced with the stories of book club members consisting of seven of her female students who met weekly at Nafisi's house to discuss works of [[Western culture|Western]] literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adriana Wilner: Women of the World. It’s the turn of Muslim women to speak. |url=http://www.muslim-refusenik.com/news/marie-claire-br-eng-05-05.html |accessdate=2008-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060506160923/http://www.muslim-refusenik.com/news/marie-claire-br-eng-05-05.html |archivedate= 2006-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, including the controversial ''[[Lolita]]'', and the texts are interpreted through the books they read.

=== Structure ===
The book is divided into four sections: "Lolita", "Gatsby", "James", and "Austen".

"Lolita" deals with Nafisi as she resigns from The University of Allameh Tabatabei and starts her private literature class with students Mahshid, Yassi, Mitra, Nassrin, Azin, Sanaz and Manna. They talk not just about ''[[Lolita]]'', but ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' and ''[[Invitation to a Beheading]]''. The main themes are oppression, jailers as revolutionary guards try to assert their authority through certain events such as a vacation gone awry and a runaway convict.

"Gatsby" is set about eleven years before "Lolita" just as the Iranian revolution starts. The reader learns how some Iranians' dreams, including the author's, became shattered through the government's imposition of new rules. Nafisi's student Mr. Nyazi puts the novel on trial, claiming that it condones adultery. Chronologically this is the first part of Nafisi's story. ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' and [[Mike Gold]]'s works are discussed in this part. The reader meets Nassrin.

Nafisi states that the Gatsby chapter is about the [[American dream]], the Iranian dream of revolution and the way it was shattered for her; the James chapter is about uncertainty and the way [[totalitarian]] mindsets hate uncertainty; and Austen is about the choice of women, a woman at the center of the novel saying no to the authority of her parents, society, and welcoming a life of dire poverty in order to make her own choice.

"James" takes place right after "Gatsby", when the [[Iran–Iraq War]] begins and Nafisi is expelled from the University of Tehran along with a few other professors. The veil becomes mandatory and she states that the government wants to control the liberal-minded professors. Nafisi meets the man she calls her "magician", seemingly a literary academician who had retired from public life at the time of the revolution. ''[[Daisy Miller]]'' and ''[[Washington Square (novel)|Washington Square]]'' are the main texts. Nassrin reappears after spending several years in prison.

"Austen" succeeds "Lolita" as Nafisi plans to leave Iran and the girls discuss the issue of marriages, men and sex. The only real flashback (not counting historical background) is into how the girls and Nafisi toyed with the idea of creating a Dear Jane society. While Azin deals with an abusive husband and Nassrin plans to leave for England, Nafisi's magician reminds her not to blame all of her problems on the Islamic Republic. ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', while the main focus, is used more to reinforce themes about blindness and empathy.

Throughout the whole novel Nafisi tackles the question of what is a hero and a villain in literature. Each independent section of the book examines notions of heroism and villainy by connecting characters from books such as ''Invitation to a Beheading'' or ''The Great Gatsby'' to others. The basis of her definition of heroism and villainy is the connection between characters who are "blind to other's problems" &lt;ref&gt;Azar Nafisi, Reading Lolita in Tehran, (Random House, New York.2004), p.132&lt;/ref&gt; such as Humbert Humbert in ''Lolita'' and characters who can empathize. This theme is intertwined with that of oppression and blindness.

== Title ==
The title refers to [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s novel, ''[[Lolita]]'', a story about a middle aged man who has a sexual relationship with a 12-year-old pubescent girl. The book ''Lolita'' is used by the author as a metaphor for life in the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]. Although the book states that the metaphor is not allegorical (p.&amp;nbsp;35) Nafisi does want to draw parallels between "victim and jailer" (p.&amp;nbsp;37). The author implies that, like the principal character in ''Lolita'', the regime in Iran imposes their "dream upon our reality, turning us into his figments of imagination."&lt;ref name="booknotes"&gt;{{cite web | title= Booknotes: An interview of the author| url=http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/176400-1/Azar+Nafisi.aspx | accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the protagonist commits the "crime of solipsizing another person's life."&lt;ref name="booknotes"/&gt;

==Background ==
Nafisi's account flashes back to the early  days of the [[Iranian revolution|revolution]], when she first started teaching at the University of Tehran amid the swirl of protests and demonstrations. In 1980, Nafisi claims she was dismissed from the [[University of Tehran]] for refusing to wear a veil; she subsequently pursued an independent writing career, bore two children, and, after a long hiatus from teaching, took a full-time job at [[Allameh Tabatabaii University]] where she resumed the teaching of fiction.&lt;ref name=random&gt;{{cite web | title= Random House: Reading Lolita in Tehran. Teacher's Guide.| url=http://www.randomhouse.com/rhpg/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780812971064&amp;view=tg | accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also discusses issues concerning the [[politics of Iran]] during and after the [[Iranian revolution]], the [[Iran–Iraq War]], and the Iranian people in general. In one instance, for example, Nafisi's students ridicule Iranian soldiers who served and died during Iran–Iraq War. She writes: "[The students] were making fun of the dead student and laughing. They joked that his death was a marriage made in heaven – didn't he and his comrades say that their only beloved was God?"

Nafisi also describes how her freedom was restricted and why she had to leave Tehran University in 1981: "I told her I did not want to wear the veil in the classroom. Did I not wear the veil, she asked, when ever I went out? Did I not wear it in the grocery store and walking down the street? It seemed I constantly had to remind people that the university was not a grocery store."&lt;!--1. Needs page reference. 2. Following needs source: "Nafisi had already taught for 15 years without refusing the veil."--&gt; Later making a compromise and accepting the veil, Nafisi came back to academia and resumed her career in Iranian universities until 1995.&lt;ref name=random/&gt;

The issue of the headscarf in Iranian society is a running theme in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bookclubs: Note for Teachers| url=http://www.bookclubs.ca/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780812971064&amp;view=printtg | accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nafisi's words: "My constant obsession with the veil had made me buy a very wide black robe with kimonolike sleeves, wide and long. I had gotten to the habit of withdrawing my hands into the sleeves and pretending that I had no hands." [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] decreed Iranian women must follow the Islamic dress code on March 7, 1979.  In Nafisi’s view, the headscarf was the icon of oppression in the aftermath of the revolution.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  In referring to Khomeini's funeral, she writes that "[t]he day women did not wear the scarf in public would be the real day of his death and the end of his revolution."  The Ayatollah Khomeini had established the new regime after a [[referendum]] on March 30 and 31, 1979, in which more than 98% of the Iranian people voted for the creation of the republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Living under Muslim Law: Dossier 23-24: Chronology of Events Regarding Women in Iran since the Revolution of 1979 |url=http://www.wluml.org/english/pubsfulltxt.shtml?cmd%5B87%5D=i-87-2796 |accessdate=2001-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050326052156/http://wluml.org/english/pubsfulltxt.shtml?cmd[87]=i-87-2796 |archivedate=March 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before this revolution, Iranian women had not been obliged to wear a veil for almost 60 years;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranian.com/Women/2003/May/Veil/ |title=Covered in messages. The veil as a political tool |author=Azadeh Namakydoust |date=2003-05-08 |publisher=The Iranian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130111002/http://iranian.com/Women/2003/May/Veil/p.html|archive-date=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrarily, women who did wear headscarves had been banned from most universities and could not work as government employees.

Although Nafisi criticizes the Iranian government, she also calls for self-criticism. In her speech at the 2004 National Book Festival, she declared that "[i]t is wrong to put all the blame on the Islamic regime or ... on the Islamic fundamentalists. It is important to probe and see what ... you [did] wrong to create this situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/cyberlc/feature_wdesc.php?rec=3617 |author=Library of Congress |title=Bookfest 04: Azar Nafisi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To ''[[The New York Times]]'', Nafisi stated that "[p]eople from my country have said the book was successful because of a Zionist conspiracy and U.S. imperialism, and others have criticized me for washing our dirty laundry in front of the enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranian.com/Books/2004/September/Writers/ |title=Off the grid.

==Derivative works==
February 2011 saw the premiere of a concert performance of an opera based on  ''Reading Lolita in Tehran'' at the University of Maryland School of Music with music by doctoral student Elisabeth Mehl Greene and a libretto co-written by Iranian-American poet Mitra Motlagh. Azar Nafasi was closely involved in the development of the project, and participated in an audience Q&amp;A session after the premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tbd.com/blogs/tbd-arts/2011/02/how-reading-lolita-in-tehran-became-an-opera-8681.html |title=How 'Reading Lolita in Tehran' became an opera |author= Andrew Beaujon |date=February 18, 2011  |work= |publisher=TBD Arts |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Nafisi's memoir of her life during the revolution and the years following caused many reactions from a wide range of perspectives—from the libertarian [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'']] magazine, the conservative [[The American Enterprise|''American Enterprise'']], to the liberal [[The Nation|''Nation'']]. Most of critics comment Nafisi's defiance of the norms of the oppressive government. On the other hand, others put emphasis on position and hardships of women in contemporary Iran. Some negative reviews, among others, appeared in the neoconservative [[Commentary (magazine)|''Commentary'']].&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;DePaul, Amy. “Re-Reading ‘Reading Lolita in Tehran.’” MELUS, vol. 33, no. 2, 2008, pp. 73–92., www.jstor.org/stable/20343467.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Positive criticism of this readership often includes the book's depiction of great literature. For example, [[Margaret Atwood]] in her review in ''Amnesty'' magazine calls the reading "enthralling," while Heather Hewett of the [[The Christian Science Monitor|''Christian Science Monitor'']] notes the book's "passionate defense of literature" that will "resonate with anyone who loves books, or who wants (or needs) to be reminded why books matter." Many comments and reviews alike note the importance of the existence of literature as a mode of refuge from tyranny and oppression, in turn giving faith to the voice of an individual. According to them, the influence of this book is two-fold. Firstly, it serves as a source of comfort for readers in hardships. Secondly, the book depicts the ways that literature speaks to readers according to the particularities of their circumstances and locations. &lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;DePaul, Amy. “Re-Reading ‘Reading Lolita in Tehran.’” MELUS, vol. 33, no. 2, 2008, pp. 73–92., www.jstor.org/stable/20343467.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a critical article published in the academic journal [[Comparative American Studies]] titled 'Reading Azar Nafisi in Tehran', Head of the North American Studies Department at [[University of Tehran]] Professor Seyed Mohammad Marandi argued that "Nafisi constantly confirms what orientalist representations have regularly claimed" and argued she "has produced gross misrepresentations of Iranian society and Islam and that she uses quotes and references which are inaccurate, misleading, or even wholly invented."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/cas/2008/00000006/00000002/art00006  |title=Reading Azar Nafisi in Tehran  |author=Seyed Mohammed Marandi |journal=Comparative American Studies| volume = 6 |issue =  2|date= June 2008 |pages= 179–189(11) |doi=10.1179/147757008x280768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fatemeh Keshavarz, Director of the Roshan Center for Persian Studies at the University of Maryland and creator of "Windows on Iran," titled her analysis of Iranian culture JASMINE AND STARS: READING MORE THAN LOLITA IN TEHRAN (UNC 2007) in response to what she saw as systematic orientalism in Nafisi's book.

A significant number of unforgiving pieces of criticism of the book brought to attention a potential predisposition to adopt neoconservative sentiments for the   large group of American readers. It is suggested that, in a way, this book offers justifications for the involvement of the United States and Bush's foreign policy goals. One of the most active and unsparing of Nafisi's critics is [[Hamid Dabashi]].

===Dabashi's criticism===
Nafisi's book drew sharp criticism by Columbia Professor [[Hamid Dabashi]], who wrote a critical essay in the June 1 edition of the Egyptian English weekly [[Al-Ahram]].&lt;ref name=ahram&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/797/special.htm  |author=Hamid Dabashi  |title=Native informers and the making of the American empire  |publisher=Al-Ahram, # 797  |date=06-01-2006  |accessdate=09-01-2008  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110012256/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/797/special.htm  |archivedate=2008-01-10  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he used the late literary scholar [[Edward Said's]] work on [[Orientalism]] to critique Nafisi's memoir as evidenced in this quote: "By seeking to recycle a kaffeeklatsch version of English literature as the ideological foregrounding of American empire, ''Reading Lolita in Tehran'' is reminiscent of the most pestiferous colonial projects of the British in India, when for example, in 1835 a colonial officer like [[Thomas Macaulay]] decreed: 'We must do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern, a class of persons Indian in blood and color, but English in taste, in opinions, words and intellect.' Azar Nafisi is the personification of that native informer and colonial agent, polishing her services for an American version of the very same project."

In a subsequent interview with ''Z Magazine'', Dabashi compared Nafisi to former American soldier [[Lynndie England]], who was convicted of abusing Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib.&lt;ref name=bookclubbed/&gt;

Dabashi and several other scholars have also noted the ways that the overly simplistic portrayal of Iranian society and framing of Afghan women as helpless victims sustains momentum for U.S. intervention in the Middle East. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banita|first=Georgiana|date=2009|title=Affect, Kitsch, and Transnational Literature: Azar Nafisi's 'Portable Worlds'|url=|journal=Contemporary Literary Criticism|volume=358|pages=87-102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to Dabashi===

Nafisi responded to Dabashi's criticism by stating that she is not, as Dabashi claims, a neoconservative, that she opposed the Iraq war, and that she is more interested in literature than in politics. In an interview, Nafisi stated that she's never argued for an attack on Iran and that democracy, when it comes, should come from the Iranian people (and not from US military or political intervention). She added that while she is willing to engage in "serious argument...Debate that is polarized isn't worth my time." She stated that she did not respond directly to Dabashi because "You don't want to debase yourself and start calling names."&lt;ref name=bookclubbed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fulford&gt;[http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/columnists/story.html?id=9837485b-aef9-49aa-b04d-8c73c804862e Reading Lolita at Columbia] by Robert Fulford, National Post, November 6, 2006 (retrieved on October 21, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali Banuazizi, the co-director of [[Boston College]]’s Middle East studies program, stated that Dabashi's article was very "intemperate" and that it was  "not worth the attention" it had received. [[Marty Peretz]], a writer of ''[[The New Republic]]'' also defended Nafisi against Dabashi's claims, asking rhetorically "Over what kind of faculty does [Columbia University president] [[Lee Bollinger]] preside?" Christopher Shea of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' argued that while Dabashi spent "several thousand words...eviscerating the book," his main point was not about the specific text but rather the book’s black-and-white portrayal of Iran.&lt;ref name=bookclubbed&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/10/29/book_clubbed/?page=2 Book clubbed] by Christopher Shea, The Boston Globe, October 29, 2006 (retrieved on October 21, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In an article posted on Slate.com, Gideon Lewis-Kraus described Dabashi's article as "a less-than-coherent [[pastiche]] of stock anti-war sentiment, strategic misreading, and childish [[calumny]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2154700/ Pawn of the Neocons?] by Gideon Lewis-Kraus, Slate.com, November 30, 2006 (retrieved on October 21, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Fulford (journalist)|Robert Fulford]] sharply criticized Dabashi in the [[National Post]], arguing that "Dabashi's frame of reference veers from [[Joseph Stalin]] to [[Edward Said]]. Like a Stalinist, he tries to convert culture into politics, the first step toward [[totalitarianism]]. Like the late Edward Said, he brands every thought he dislikes as an example of imperialism, expressing the West's desire for [[hegemony]] over the downtrodden (even when oil-rich) nations of the Third World. While imitating the attitudes of Said, Dabashi deploys painful cliches."&lt;ref name=Fulford/&gt;

Firoozeh Papan-Matin, Director of Persian and Iranian Studies at the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle, also criticized Dabashi's characterization of Nafisi, stating that Dabashi's accusation that Nafisi is promoting a "'kaffeeklatsch' worldview... callously ignores the extreme social and political conditions that forced Nafisi underground." Papan Matin also argued that "Dabashi’s attack is that whether Nafisi is a collaborator with the [United States]" was not relevant to the legitimate questions set forth in her book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1190886485566&amp;pagename=Zone-English-Muslim_Affairs%2FMAELayout Reading &amp; Misreading Lolita in Tehran] by Dr. Firoozeh Papan-Matin, IslamOnline, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regulation 17''' ({{lang-fr|Règlement 17}}) was a regulation of the [[Ontario]]  Conservative government designed to shut down French-language schools at a time when Francophones from Quebec were moving into eastern Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Craig Brown,  and Ramsay Cook, ''Canada, 1896-1921: A nation transformed'' (1974) pp 253-62&lt;/ref&gt; It was a regulation written by the [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|Ministry of Education]], issued in July 1912 by the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Conservative]] government of [[Premier of Ontario|premier]] Sir [[James P. Whitney]].&lt;ref name="tce"&gt;Barber, Marilyn. "[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/ontario-schools-question/ Ontario Schools Question]", in ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'', retrieved November 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It restricted the use of [[French language|French]] as a language of instruction to the first two years of schooling. It was amended in 1913, and it is that version that was applied throughout Ontario.&lt;ref name="slmc"&gt;SLMC. "[http://www.salic-slmc.ca/showpage.asp?file=legislations_ling/documents_hist/1912_reglement_17&amp;language=en&amp;updatemenu=false&amp;noprevnext Regulation 17: Circular of Instruction No. 17 for Ontario Separate Schools for the School Year 1912–1913]", in ''Site for Language Management in Canada'', retrieved November 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;   French Canadians reacted vehemently, and lost, dooming its French-language Catholic schools.{{citation needed|reason=French Catholic schools still exist.|date=August 2016}}  This was a reason why French Canadians distanced itself from the subsequent [[Canada in World War I|World War I]] effort, as its young men refused to enlist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon L. Heath|title=Canadian Churches and the First World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4INBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT82|year=2014|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|pages=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French reaction==
[[French Canadians]] reacted with outrage. Quebec journalist [[Henri Bourassa]] in November 1914 denounced the "Prussians of Ontario."  With the World War raging, this was a stinging insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Craig Brown and David Clark MacKenzie|title=Canada and the First World War: Essays in Honour of Robert Craig Brown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqtjsLl292oC&amp;pg=PA107|year=2005|publisher=U. of Toronto Press|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The policy was strongly opposed by [[Franco-Ontarian]]s, particularly in the national capital of [[Ottawa]] where the [[École Guigues]] was at the centre of the controversy. The newspaper ''[[Le Droit]]'', which is still published today as the province's only francophone daily newspaper, was established by the [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate]] in 1913 to oppose the ban. Faced with separate school boards' resistance and defiance of the new regulation, the Ministry of Education issued Regulation 18 in August 1913 to coerce the school boards' employees into compliance.&lt;ref&gt;Leclerc, Jacques. "[http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/amnord/ontario_reglement18.htm Circular of Instructions No. 18]", in ''L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde'', retrieved November 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Ontario's Catholics were led by the Irish Bishop Fallon, who united with the Protestants in opposing French schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jack|last=Cecillon|title=Turbulent Times in the Diocese of London: Bishop Fallon and the French-Language Controversy, 1910–18|journal=Ontario History|date=December 1995|volume=87|issue=4|pages=369–395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation 17 was repealed in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Marilyn|last=Barber|title=The Ontario Bilingual Schools Issue: Sources of Conflict|journal=Canadian Historical Review|date=September 1966|volume=47|issue=3|pages=227–248|doi=10.3138/chr-047-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack D. Cecillon, ''Prayers, Petitions, and Protests: The Catholic Church and the Ontario Schools Crisis in the Windsor Border Region, 1910-1928'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, the provincial government of Sir [[William Howard Hearst|William Hearst]] replaced Ottawa's elected [[separate school]] board with a government-appointed commission. After years of litigation from [[AFO (Canada)|ACFÉO]], however, the directive was never fully implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25040/25040-h/25040-h.htm The Project Gutenberg EBook of Bilingualism, by Hon. N. A. Belcourt K.C., P.C. Bilingualism Address delivered before the Quebec Canadian Club, at Quebec, Tuesday, March 28th, 1916]&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulation was eventually repealed in 1927 by the government of [[Howard Ferguson]] following the recommendations of the Merchant-Scott-Côté report.&lt;ref name="slmc" /&gt; Ferguson was an opponent of [[bilingualism]], but repealed the law because he needed to form a political alliance with Quebec premier [[Louis-Alexandre Taschereau]] against the [[Government of Canada|federal government]]. The Conservative government reluctantly recognized bilingual schools, but the directive worsened relations between Ontario and Quebec for many years and is still keenly remembered by the French-speaking minority of Ontario.

Despite the repeal of Regulation 17, however, French-language schools in Ontario were not officially recognized under the provincial Education Act until 1968.

The [[Ontario Heritage Trust]] erected a plaque for L’École Guigues and Regulation 17 in front of the former school building, 159 Murray Street, Ottawa. "L’École Guigues became the centre of minority-rights agitation in Ontario when in 1912 the provincial government issued a directive, commonly called Regulation 17, restricting French-language education. Mounting protests forced the government to moderate its policy and in 1927 bilingual schools were officially recognized."

'''Self-Financing Higher Education in Hong Kong''' refers to educational programmes at the sub-degree level and above provided by local self-financing entities. Since the government announced the target of enabling 60% of secondary school graduates to receive higher education, the self-financing post-secondary education sector has experienced significant expansion with the aim of accommodating the emerging needs of the society.&lt;ref&gt;Tung, C. H. 2000. Policy Address 2000. Hong Kong: Government Printer. http:// www.policyaddress.gov.hk/pa00/hlight_e.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Changing needs of knowledge-based economy ===
The emergence of [[Knowledge economy|knowledge-based economy]] has often been highlighted by the government in explaining its initiatives in the Higher Education sector.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;University Grants Committee (2010). "Aspirations for the Higher Education System in Hong Kong: Report of the University Grants Committee", December.&lt;/ref&gt; The changing manpower needs of a knowledge-based economy increases the demand for higher education around the world. As a knowledge-based economy depends upon knowledge and its agile applications, it requires an educated population and the corresponding massification of post-secondary education.

=== Massification since 1990s ===
During the early period of [[History of Hong Kong (1800s–1930s)|British colonial rule]], higher education served as a platform for the British Empire to train Chinese elites who were likely to become government officials in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, B. 1992. Lugard in Hong Kong: Empires, Education and a Governor at Work 1907–1912. Hong Kong: University of Hong Kong Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 2579 students (2.2% of the relevant age groups) were enrolled as first-year students in local university degree programmes in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Siu-yau(2015). ''Massification without equalisation: the politics of higher education, graduate employment and social mobility in Hong Kong.'' Journal of Education and Work. DOI: 10.1080/13639080.2015.1049024&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the higher education sector began to experience rapid massification since the 1990s. The most significant move in massification is encapsulated by the Chief Executive’s policy in 2000, which sets the target of raising the participation rate in post-secondary education from 33% to 60% in ten years’ time.&lt;ref&gt;Education and Manpower Bureau (2008). "Steering Committee Report of the Phase Two Review of the Post Secondary Education Sector", April.&lt;/ref&gt; The objective has been achieved in the middle of the decade due to the rapid expansion of the self-financing post-secondary institutions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lo, J., Yung W. K. and Feng, Q. (2014). The Development and Challenges of Self-financing Higher Education in Hong Kong. Public Administration and Policy, 18(1), 75-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth of self-financing institutions ===
In 2017, 61,600 secondary school graduates attended the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]] (HKDSE) Examination. Around 28,000 achieved results that met the admission criteria for a university degree, while only 12,700 of them could enrol in the government-funded degree programmes offered by eight universities in Hong Kong through the [[Joint University Programmes Admissions System|Joint University Programmes Admission System]] (JUPAS).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipass.gov.hk/eng/postsec_keystat.pdf|title=Key Statistics on Post-secondary Education|last=|first=|date=|website=Information Portal for Accredited Post-secondary Programmes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the large number of academically qualified candidates, the government-funded bachelor's degree cannot provide sufficient places for the graduates, which gives the self-financing institutions a crucial role in meeting the rising demand.

== Modes of operation ==

=== Publicly-funded post-secondary education institutions ===
[[File:HKAPA logo.svg|thumb|HKAPA, one of the publicly-funded post-secondary education institutions]]
They offer programmes through their self-financing continuing and professional education arms or member institutions under their aegis. These institutions include the eight UGC-funded institutions, and the [[Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts|Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Legislative Council Panel on Education (2012).

#1200 non-local courses registered or exempted under the Non-local High and Professional Education (Regulation) Ordinance (Cap.493)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Key government policies ==
=== Financial Support ===
Over the years, the Government has provided a series of financial schemes to support self-financing higher education institutions, including:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Start-up Loan Scheme (2001)'''
* Interest-free loans provided to self-financing higher education institutions for the construction of new premises or renovation/extension of existing premises.
'''Self-financing Higher Education Fund (2011)'''
* A $2.5 billion fund is established for awarding scholarships to outstanding students who study full-time in locally accredited self-financing programmes.
'''Quality Enhancement Grant Scheme (2012)'''
* A scheme aiming to support initiatives or projects which promote better teaching and learning experience of self-financing programmes.
'''Research Endowment Fund (2012)'''
* A $3 billion fund established to support academic enhancement and research development for a total of eleven institutions which provide locally accredited self-financing degree programmes.
'''Student Financial Assistance Schemes'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wfsfaa.gov.hk/sfo/en/postsecondary/index.htm|title=Financial Assistance Schemes|last=|first=|date=|website=Student Finance Office, Working Family and Student Financial Assistance Agency, Hong Kong|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Student Finance Office provides both means-tested and non-means-tested financial assistance schemes for students attending self-financing programmes. These schemes include Financial Assistance Scheme for Post-secondary Students (FASP) (for full-time students, means-tested) and Non-means-tested Loan Scheme for Post-secondary Students (NLSPS).
'''Study Subsidy Scheme for Designated Professions/Sectors (SSSDP)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jupas.edu.hk/en/sssdp/about-sssdp/objectives/|title=About SSSDP|last=|first=|date=|website=Joint University Programmes Admissions System|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scheme was first launched in the 2015/16 academic year. It subsidized around 1000 students per cohort to pursue designated full-time locally accredited self-financing undergraduate programmes in selected disciplines. The scheme will increase the number of subsidized places to around 3000 students per cohort in the 2018/19 academic year.

=== Quality Assurance ===
Currently in Hong Kong, three bodies are responsible for quality assurance of programmes offered by higher education institutions. In order to receive local accreditation, the programme has to satisfy the standards of the Hong Kong Qualifications Framework (QF) to ensure credibility and recognition.
# [[Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications]] (HKCAAVQ): It is responsible for accreditation and qualification registration of programmes offered by all non-UGC-funded institutions. It monitors the compliance of both the operation (e.g. governance structure, financial condition, etc.) and programme quality (e.g. quality of teaching and learning, academic standard, etc.) with the requirements stipulated in the Hong Kong Qualification Framework.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Quality Assurance Council (QAC): QAC was established in 2007 under the [[University Grants Committee (Hong Kong)|University Grants Committee]] (UGC). The main responsibility of QAC is to conduct quality audits of all programmes, both Government-funded and self-financed programmes included, offered by UGC-funded institutions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Joint Quality Review Committee (JQRC): JQRC was established in 2005 by the Heads of Universities Committee. It is responsible for providing peer review on the quality assurance processes of self-financing sub-degree programmes offered by UGC-funded institutions. The objective is to ensure quality assurance assessments achieve the requirements of the Hong Kong Qualification Framework.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Recognition of Associate Degrees ===
The qualification of associate degree is recognized by around 26 professional bodies in Hong Kong, such as  information technology, logistics, financial services, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov.hk/english/info/2170.html|title=Acceptance of qualifications under the new academic structure for civil service appointment purposes|last=|first=|date=|website=Civil Service Bureau|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For recruitment in the civil service, the Civil Service Bureau started accepting locally accredited associate degree qualifications (as broadly equivalent to Higher Diploma qualifications) since 2001. There are more than 70 grades that accept applications from associate degree holders (who hold associate degree as one’s highest qualification), including 13 grades that require higher diploma qualifications or below, and other grades that require qualifications below sub-degree level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov.hk/mobile/tc_chi/info/1500.html|title=LCQ3:Recognition of associate degree qualification for civil service appointment|last=|first=|date=|website=Civil Service Bureau|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-means-tested Subsidy Scheme for Self-financing Undergraduate Studies ===
Under [[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Carrie Lam's administration]], the government introduced a non-means-tested annual subsidy for eligible students pursuing full-time locally accredited self-financing undergraduate programmes in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/2098888/who-benefits-hk5-billion-pledged-carrie-lam-hong|title=Who benefits from the HK$5 billion pledged by Carrie Lam for Hong Kong’s education sector?|last=Chiu|first=Peace|date=18 June 2017|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidy scheme provides a $30,000 subsidy to Hong Kong students who have either attained (a) “3322” in Hong Kong Diploma for Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE) or (b) sub-degree qualifications at the time when they are enrolled in the selected self-financing undergraduate degree programs.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201708/04/P2017080400405.htm|title=Non-means-tested Subsidy Scheme for Self-financing Undergraduate Studies in Hong Kong announced|last=|first=|date=|website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the scheme does not cover UGC-funded degree and sub-degree programs, self-financing degree programs at UGC-funded universities and sub-degree programs, including associate degrees and higher diplomas, offered by private universities and colleges.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to [[Kevin Yeung Yun-hung]], Deputy Education Chief, sub-degree programs are not covered in the subsidy scheme as the government has to evaluate their value and orientation in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theowl.hk/2017/07/07/%E8%87%AA%E5%8A%A9%E5%AD%B8%E4%BD%8D%E5%AD%B8%E5%88%B8%E5%88%B6-%E7%82%BA%E4%BA%86%E5%AD%B8%E7%94%9F%E9%82%84%E6%98%AF%E7%82%BA%E4%BA%86%E7%94%A2%E6%A5%AD%E5%8C%96%EF%BC%9F-%E4%B8%98%E8%80%81/|title=自資學位學券制 為了學生還是為了產業化？ {{!}} 丘老二|last=|first=|date=|website=The Owl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the subsidy scheme had led to the reduction of the tuition fees level in private universities and colleges. Prior to the subsidy scheme, most of the self-financing degree programs charged students HKD $60,000 - $130,000 a year.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Under the new subsidy scheme, the tuition fees for most self-financing degree programs drop to HKD$24,000 - $99,030.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Some institutions even have a tuition fee level lower than the one at publicly-funded universities. Students reading eligible private college degree programs will therefore benefit directly from reduced tuition fees and financial burden.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The economic incentive may encourage more students to apply for self-financing higher degree offered by the selected private universities and colleges. After the release of HKDSE result, some candidates expressed their interests in applying to self-financing degree program instead of the self-financing associate degree programs, mainly because of the lower tuitions fees of the former under the new subsidy scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/2102401/following-money-hong-kong-self-financing-degrees|title=Following the money: Hong Kong self-financing degrees gain more students with new education subsidy|last=Chiu|first=Peace|date=12 July 2017|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Kevin Yeung Yun-hung]] revealed in mid-November 2017 that there was no major shift in the proportion of students between self-financing degree and sub-degree programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1365545-20171118.htm|title=Over 20,000 sign up for degree subsidy|last=|first=|date=18 November 2017|work=RTHK English News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ng Po-shing, Director of the Student Guidance Centre of Hok Yau Club, explained that most of the self-financing degree programs offered by the selected private universities and colleges have a relatively low recognition in the society and in the job market, and that students would prefer reading a sub-degree to seek admission to public universities.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hk01.com/%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E/102804/-%E6%95%99%E8%82%B250%E5%84%84-%E8%87%AA%E8%B3%87%E8%AA%8D%E5%8F%97%E8%BC%83%E5%85%AB%E5%A4%A7%E5%89%AF%E5%AD%B8%E4%BD%8D%E4%BD%8E-%E4%BA%BA%E5%8A%9B%E9%A1%A7%E5%95%8F-%E8%B3%87%E5%8A%A9%E5%AE%89%E6%8E%92%E4%B8%8D%E7%8F%BE%E5%AF%A6|title=【教育50億】自資認受較八大副學位低　人力顧問：資助安排不現實|last=何|first=敬淘|date=6 July 2017|work=Hong Kong 01|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly the case when students reading sub-degree programs can apply for the subsidized self-financing degree programs even if they cannot be admitted to public universities after graduation.  Therefore, Ng predicted that the $30,000 subsidy has little influence on students’ decision in choosing between self-financing degree and sub-degree programmes.&lt;ref&gt;何, 敬淘 (6 July 2017).

== Challenges ==

=== Declining number of secondary school graduates ===
With the reduction of school-age population, a persistent decline in the number of local secondary school graduates is projected in the next few years. The number will continuously decrease from 71,700 in 2014 to 45,100 in 2022,  and is anticipated to climb to 69,900 in 2030.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is projected that starting from 2017, the number of post-secondary intake places will be more than the number of eligible candidates. There will be insufficient number of prospective student among self-financing higher educational institutions, resulting in the low demand for post-secondary education.

Meanwhile, the supply of both publicly-funded and self-financing post-secondary education programs are anticipated to increase in the coming years.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hk.on.cc/hk/bkn/cnt/news/20160601/bkn-20160601123551973-0601_00822_001.html|title=82%學位收生遜預期　自資院校恐陸續送死|last=|first=|date=|website=on.cc|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surplus of post-secondary education programmes suggests a more fierce competition for eligible candidates within the expanding self-financing higher education sector. In 2016, the Education Bureau found that 82% of the self-financing higher education programs had the actual intake of students lower than their expected number.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, Chu Hai College of Higher Education expected to recruit 1030 students in the first year of admission, but only 169 were eventually accepted.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Similarly, Centennial College provided 440 intake places while only 75 students were admitted at the end.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Since the funding of self-financing higher education institutions depends upon their tuition fee income, the intensified competition will drive some private universities and colleges  into financial difficulties. In 2016, it was revealed that Centennial College faced serious financial difficulties such that it was taken over by and currently managed by HKU School of Professional and Continuing Education (HKU SPACE).&lt;ref&gt;Tse, Wai-Man (2016). ''An Analysis of the Current Private Higher Education and the Role of University Governance in Hong Kong''. Chu Hai College of Higher Education.1-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the figure of secondary school population climbs up again, it is expected that self-financing post-secondary institutions will face grave problems in terms of admission and finance.

Members from the education sector criticised the government for failing to foresee the future decline of secondary population, and wrongly encouraged the private sector to expand the self-financing post-secondary sector.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Financial constraints ===
Different financial schemes (such as Self-financing Higher Education Fund and Quality Enhancement Grant Scheme) have been implemented to support the development of self-financing higher education institutions. However, no recurrent funds are provided for daily operation of facilities, salaries of teaching and non-teaching staff, and extra-curricular activities for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.synergynet.org.hk/2016/08/%E5%BC%B5%E5%9C%8B%E8%8F%AF%EF%BC%9A%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E5%B9%B3%E7%AD%89%EF%B8%B0%E8%B3%87%E5%8A%A9%E8%88%87%E8%87%AA%E8%B3%87%E9%99%A2%E6%A0%A1/|title=Cheung Kwok-wah:Education Equality: Funded and Self-financing Institutions|last=Cheung|first=Kwok-wah|date=|website=SynergyNet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to UGC-funded universities, which receive Government’s subsidy of $242,260 per student every year since the 2015/16 academic year, the major income source of self-financing institutions comes from tuition fees, which is around $60,000-$85,000 per student every year, but this cannot cover their operational expenses. Despite the financial difficulties, they are also reluctant to have significant increase in their tuition fees due to the concern of negative publicity. The lack of alumni network and reputation also aggravates the difficulty for the institutions to obtain donations from society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.master-insight.com/%E8%87%AA%E8%B3%87%E9%99%A2%E6%A0%A1%E9%9D%A2%E5%B0%8D%E8%B3%87%E6%BA%90%E5%9B%B0%E9%9B%A3%E8%88%87%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E5%85%AC%E5%B9%B3/|title=Self-financing institutions face with resource difficulties and education equality|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ineffective peer review mechanism  ===
The 2012 ‘CCLU’ incident aroused public concern towards the quality of teaching and learning offered by self-financing higher education institutions.

First, there was the problem of excess admission of students. The original number of placements for all programmes in the 2012/13 academic year was 1900 students, but over 5400 students were being admitted in total. Owing to insufficient classroom facilities, lessons were cut from three hours to two hours in order to accommodate all registered students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://the-sun.on.cc/cnt/news/20120926/00407_067.html|title=嶺大副學士超收兩倍|last=|first=|date=|website=on.cc news|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the tutor-student ratio exceeded the Education Bureau’s requirement. The maximum capacity for language courses was 25 students, but the class size at most reached 40 students. Given the limited resources regarding classroom facilities and qualified tutors, it would be difficult for the institution to maintain the quality of teaching and learning.

Second, unregistered courses were being offered. In the ‘CCLU’ incident, it was discovered that CCLU offered 25 unregistered courses which were not listed on the Information Portal for Accredited Post-secondary Programmes (IPASS), a website launched by the Government in 2007 to provide information on programmes and courses offered by higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hkptu.org/6677|title=嶺大超收副學位學生 教協會促政府嚴正介入|last=|first=|date=|website=Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ‘CCLU’ incident revealed the ineffectiveness of JQRC’s peer review mechanism. There was a lack of transparency on the manner in which peer reviews on quality assurance processes were being conducted. Impartiality of the mechanism was also doubted owing to the absence of an independent third party in the review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.mingpao.com/pns/%E5%BC%B5%E8%B6%85%E6%B0%91%EF%B9%95%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E8%87%AA%E8%B3%87%E5%B0%88%E4%B8%8A%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E7%9A%84%E5%8D%B1%E5%B1%80/web_tc/article/20150710/s00012/1436464114012|title=張超民﹕香港自資專上教育的危局|last=Cheung|first=Chiu-man|date=|website=Ming Pao|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insufficient recognition ===
In promoting self-financing higher education institutions, the government emphasizes the broad coverage of both general and professional education offered by these institutions, together with the recognition of higher diploma and associate degree qualifications by various professional bodies. However, the problem of insufficient recognition remains due to the inconsistency between curriculum design and the skills required for human resources in Hong Kong. The learning outcome of these programmes do not match with current demands of  techniques and soft skills in the labour market, which has adversely affected the employability of graduates and the recognition of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, T. (2013). "Seminar on Closer Alignment between Post-secondary Education Institutions and Industries", &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.cspe.edu.hk/PDFs/Alignment/CSPE_Banking_Teresa.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons is that there is inadequate communication and collaboration between institutions and the industry, leading to weak alignments in curriculum design and actual skills needed in the real world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The socio-economic prospect of graduates, especially associate degree graduates, reflects the recognition issue of self-financing higher education institutions from another perspective. Although associate degree is an independently recognized qualification, it is commonly perceived as stepping stones to bachelor's degree programmes. For those aged 30–34 earning a monthly salary over $30,000, 42.3% have a bachelor's degree, while only 6.3% obtain associate degree as one’s highest qualification.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.mingpao.com/pns/dailynews/web_tc/article/20171114/s00003/1510595830434|title=社評：高教失策亡羊補牢 副學士須重新定位|last=|first=|date=|website=Ming Pao|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, reports showed that 63.7% associate degree holders aged 20–34 earn an income lower than the overall median income in Hong Kong, with a significant discrepancy with bachelor's degree holders.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The recognition of self-financing higher education institutions is also affected by Government’s accreditation. Under the Post-Secondary Colleges Ordinance (Cap. 320), the accreditation process is conducted by Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications (HKCAAVQ). The process is criticised for its expensive cost and the duration that it takes for self-financing institutions to be upgraded to private universities, which involves two rounds and usually takes an institution ten years for the upgrading process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Recommendations ==

=== Reform of Quality Assurance Mechanism ===
[[File:University Grants Committee.svg|thumb|Reform of Quality Assurance Mechanism mentioned in the 2010 report of the University Grants Committee]]
In pursuance of coherence and consistency in quality assurance practice, the University Grants Committee proposed in 2010 the integration of HKCAAVQ, Joint Quality Review Committee and the Quality Assurance Council.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The rationale lies in the fragmented division of responsibilities among the three quality assurance bodies, with different bodies regulating certain parts of the oversight system. Considering the quality-assurance agencies for sub-degree programmes, programmes offered by UGC-funded are monitored by the Joint Quality Review Committee, while others are quality-assured by the Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

From the student's viewpoint, it is difficult to compare the quality of self-financing sub-degree programme provided by a UGC-funded institution and a private institution, as they are quality-regulated by two different bodies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For education providers, the fragmented oversight mechanism casts doubt upon the consistencies in the quality assurance practices applied to different institutions. The differences in regulatory frameworks, for example, allow UGC-funded institutions to offer new programmes in a faster manner as compared to other institutions, which have to go through the HKCAAVQ process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Institutional Governance ===
With reference to overseas examples, the Committee on Self-financing post-secondary Education translated the principles into concrete recommendation for governance practices.

Firstly, it proposes the development of strategic and operational plans that are aligned with the missions and visions of the institutions.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;University Grants Committee (2015). "Governance in UGC-funded Higher Education Institutions in Hong Kong", December.&lt;/ref&gt; The abstract plan should be translated into detailed analysis of the institution’s strengths and weaknesses, and assessment of the risk and opportunities in the external environment.

Also, the institutions should publish annual reports that reviews their performance against the published strategic and operational plans.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Financial information should be made available to current students and the general public.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In respect of the governing structures, the governing body should include different stakeholders and a mix of expertise. An institution should establish a system of appointment of members to its governing body and key committees, which enhances the transparency and accountability of its governance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Code of Practice ===
To standardize the benchmark of these institutions, the Steering Committee on the Review of Post-secondary Education Sector proposes the introduction of a code of practice that broadly outlines the arrangements for good governance and quality assurance.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Committee on Self-financing Post-secondary Education (2015). "Consultation Document on Code of Good Practices on Governance and Quality Assurance", February.&lt;/ref&gt; The code assures student, employers and the public that the governance and quality assurance of self-financing post-secondary education institutions will stay within the stipulated ambit of the code.

The committee suggests that the code should be based on principles of good governance and quality assurance derived from academic studies and overseas examples, which include:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
# Participation and accountability: (Appointment of external member to the governing body; Training programme for governing body; accountability mechanism)
# Inclusiveness: (Diverse composition of governing body and relevant committees; Involvement of different stakeholders in the QA processes)
# Performance-based: (Compilation of performance indicators)
# Transparency (public accessibility to key information)

As the principles and processes of governance and QA are closely related, it gives credence to the proposal of introducing one single code covering both governance and QA.

=== Curriculum ===
The convenor of Education and Training Sub-committee of Banking Industry Training Advisory Committee criticised the weak alignments and communications between educational institutions and industries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Currently, the curriculum focuses on generic banking and finance knowledge, which has to be adjusted to reflect the real world and puts more emphasis on technical and soft skills. There were rarely dialogues between institutions and the industry on knowledge, skills and attributes that banks require.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, T. (2013). "Seminar on Closer Alignment between Post-secondary Education Institutions and Industries", &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.cspe.edu.hk/PDFs/Alignment/CSPE_Banking_Teresa.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Education Bureau urges self-financing higher education institutions to conduct in-depth research on the  current needs of society, and engage employers and professional bodies to participate in the curriculum design.&lt;ref&gt;Education Bureau (2013). "Self-financing Post-secondary Education Programmes", EDB(FE)1/12/2041/00, August.&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of the rise of economic power in Asia, the University Grants Committee highlights the need of incorporating the Asian context in building the new curricula.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The additional focus would provide a distinctive character to part of Hong Kong higher education and enhance the learning horizons of local and non-local students alike.

=== Extension of the Subsidy Scheme ===
Some criticise that the scheme covers only self-financing degree programs offered by private universities and colleges, excluding those offered by UGC-funded universities. A number of students reading self-financing degree programmes in public universities complained that the scheme is unfair to them, since they have to pay even higher level of tuition fees than their counterparts in private universities.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.inmediahk.net/node/1050824|title=自資學士3萬資助不包八大 學生：不公平 教協：應先通過|last=|first=|date=18 July 2017|work=Inmedia Hong Kong|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isabella Ng Fung-sheung, Assistant Professor at Education University, considered that the government deliberately drew a demarcation between self-financing degree programs offered by public universities and those offered by private universities.&lt;ref name="Inmedia Hong Kong 2017"&gt;自資學士3萬資助不包八大 學生：不公平 教協：應先通過". Inmedia Hong Kong. 18 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  She argued that the subsidy scheme was introduced to assist those “weak” private universities to survive amidst the declining number of secondary 6 population, and therefore the relatively “strong” UGC-operated self-financing degree programs with sufficient intake of students are not covered under the scheme.&lt;ref name="Inmedia Hong Kong 2017"/&gt; Such a distinction would impede benign competition in self-financing higher education market, therefore failing to weed out those substandard degree programs offered by private post-secondary institutions.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; President of the Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union, Dr. Fung Wai-wah, also criticized the demarcation deprives students of the choice to choose between quality self-financing degree programs offered by public universities and those substandard programs offered by private colleges.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Political commentator, Albert Cheng opts for the proposal of extending the subsidy scheme to programmes offered by UGC-funded institutions.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2108128/why-carrie-lams-hk30000-subsidy-may-hurt-quality-higher|title=Why Carrie Lam’s HK$30,000 subsidy may hurt the quality of higher education in Hong Kong|last=Cheng|first=Albert|date=24 August 2017|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By providing economic incentives to students applying for self-financing degree programs offered by private universities, Cheng worried that those better-quality UGC-funded degree programs will be marginalized after the introduction of the subsidy scheme.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; He considered that it is “ridiculous” to expend valuable public resources to fund substandard programs at private universities and compel students to accept poor-quality education.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Such substandard programs, as he argued, shall not receive any subsidization so that they can be weeded out in the market to raise the overall quality of the degree programs in self-financing higher education market.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Nevertheless, Ng Po-shing submitted that Cheng’s worry may be exaggerated, since the new $30,000 subsidy scheme does not appear to affect students’ decision in the 2017/2018 intake, and most students opt to either read a UGC-funded degree program, or a sub-degree program, which provides less capable performers in HKDSE with an alternative route to public universities.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''Single-sex education''', also known as '''single-gender education''', is the practice of conducting [[education]] with male and female students attending separate classes, perhaps in separate buildings or schools. The practice was common before the 20th century, particularly in [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education]]. Single-sex education in many cultures is advocated on the basis of tradition as well as religion, and is practiced in many parts of the world. Recently, there has been a surge of interest and establishment of single-sex schools due to educational research.&lt;ref name="Riordan 2009"&gt;[http://www.alcedargentina.com.ar/images/libroponencias.pdf  Riordan, C. (2009). The Effects of Single Sex Schools: Alced. Argentina]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Single-sex education is practiced in many Muslim majority countries; while in the West it is most popular in [[Chile]], [[Israel]], [[South Korea]], and English-speaking countries such as [[Singapore]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]],&lt;ref name="rte.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0922/306498-education/|title=Single-sex schools not superior - study|date=22 September 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Kingdom]], [[Hong Kong]] in China, [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="Riordan 2011"&gt;C. Riordan (2011). The Value of Single Sex Education: Twenty Five Years of High Quality Research, Third International Congress of the European Association for Single Sex Education, Warsaw, Poland.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western world]], single sex education is primarily associated with the [[private school|private sector]], with the public (state) sector being overwhelmingly mixed sex; while in the [[Muslim world]] the situation is the opposite: public schools are usually single sex, while many private schools are mixed sex. Motivations for single sex education range from religious ideas of [[sex segregation]] to beliefs that the sexes learn and behave differently, and, as such, they thrive in a single sex environment. In the 19th century, in Western countries, single sex girls' [[finishing schools]], and [[women's college]]s offered women a chance of education at a time when they were denied access to mainstream educational institutions. The former were especially common in Switzerland, the latter in the US and the UK, which were pioneers in women's education.

==History==
[[File:New_England_Female_Medical_College.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[New England Female Medical College]]]]
[[File:Trabzon Yunan Okulu.JPG|thumb|left|200 px|Girls' school in Trebizond (modern [[Trabzon]]), early 20th century]]
[[File:StateLibQld_1_131467_Brisbane_Girls_Grammar_School_students_relaxing_on_the_grass,_1914.jpg|thumb|Girl students from [[Brisbane Girls Grammar School]], 1914]]
In 19th century Western Europe, the most common way for girls to access education was at home, through [[Tutor|private tutoring]], and not at school. This was especially the case in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], which strongly resisted women's involvement in schools. By contrast, in the US, early feminists were successful in establishing women's educational institutions. These were different from and considered inferior to men's institutions, but they created some of the first opportunities to formalized higher education for women in the Western world. The [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters colleges]] offered unprecedented emancipation for women. The pioneer [[Salem College]] of [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] was founded in 1772, originally as a primary school, later becoming an academy (high school) and finally a college. The [[New England Female Medical College]] (1848) and the [[Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania]] (1850) were the first medical institutions in the world established to train women in medicine and offer them the M.D. degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peitzman|first=Steven J.|title=A new and untried course : Woman's Medical College and Medical College of Pennsylvania, 1850 - 1998|year=2000|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, N.J [u.a.]|isbn=0-8135-2815-1|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, ideas about education started to change: modern ideas that defined [[right to education|education as a right]], rather than as a privilege available only to a small elite, started to gain support in North America and Europe. As such, mass [[elementary education]] was introduced, and more and more coeducational schools were set up. Together with mass education, the coeducation became standard in many places. Increased [[secularization]] in the 20th century also contributed to the acceptance of [[mixed sex education]]. In 1917 coeducation was mandated in the Soviet Union. According to Cornelius Riordan, "By the end of the nineteenth century, coeducation was all but universal in American elementary and secondary public schools (see Kolesnick, 1969; Bureau of Education, 1883; Butler, 1910; Riordan, 1990).  And by the end of the 20th century, this was largely true across the world. In the UK, Australia, and Ireland the tradition of single sex education remained quite strong until the 1960s. The 1960s and 1970s were a period of intense social changes, and during that era many anti-discrimination laws were passed, such as the 1972 [[Title IX]]. Wiseman (2008) shows that by 2003, only a few countries across the globe have greater than one or two percent single sex schools. But there are exceptions where the percent of single sex schools exceeds 10 percent: [[Belgium]], [[Chile]], [[Singapore]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Israel]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[South Korea]], and most Muslim nations.  Recently, however, there has been a resurgence of interest in single sex schools in modern societies across the globe, both in the public and private sector (Riordan, 2002)."&lt;ref name="Riordan 2011"/&gt;

==Effects==
The topic of single-sex education is controversial.  Advocates argue that it aids student outcomes such as test scores, graduation rates, and solutions to behavioral difficulties.  Opponents, however, argue that evidence for such effects is inflated or non-existent, and instead argue that such segregation can increase [[sexism]] and impairs the development of interpersonal skills.

Advocates of single-sex education believe that there are persistent [[gender differences]] in how boys and girls learn and behave in educational settings, and that such differences merit educating them separately. One version of this argument holds that male-female brain differences favor the implementation of gender-specific teaching methods, but such claims have not held up to rigorous scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eliot|first=Lise|date=2011-08-18|title=Single-Sex Education and the Brain|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-011-0037-y|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=69|issue=7–8|pages=363–381|doi=10.1007/s11199-011-0037-y|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, supporters of single-sex education argue that by segregating the genders, students do not become distracted by the other gender's actions in the classrooms, but most of the social distraction in classrooms is actually attributable to same-gender interactions.
===US 2005 systematic review and 2008 study ===
A systematic review published in 2005 covering 2221 studies was commissioned by the [[US Department of Education]] entitled ''Single-sex versus coeducational schooling: A systematic review''. The review, which had statistical controls for socio-economic status of the students and resources of the schools, etc., found that in the study on the effects of single-sex schooling

:"the results are equivocal. There is some support for the premise that single-sex schooling can be helpful, especially for certain outcomes related to academic achievement and more positive academic aspirations. For many outcomes, there is no evidence of either benefit or harm. There is limited support for the view that single-sex schooling may be harmful or that coeducational schooling is more beneficial for the student."

:"In terms of outcomes that may be of most interest to the primary stakeholders (students and their parents), such as academic achievement, self-concept, and long-term indicators of success, there is a degree of support for SS schooling." 

It also said that in general, most studies reported positive effects for single-sex schools on all-subject achievement tests and the preponderance of studies in areas such as academic accomplishment (both concurrent and long term) and adaptation or socioemotional development (both concurrent and long term) yields results lending support to single-sex schooling.&lt;ref name="DOE1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/other/single-sex/single-sex.pdf|title=U.S. Department of Education, "Single-sex versus coeducational schooling: A systematic review" (Department of Education, Washington, DC, 2005)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantitative data itself "finds positive results are three to four times more likely to be found for single sex schools than for coeducational schools in the same study for both academic achievement and socio-emotional development," said Cornelius Riordan, one of the directors of the research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easse.org/docs/1209565580_Congreso%204.07.%20Ponencias%20y%20comunicaciones.pdf Riordan, C.

Barcelona]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the US government sponsored another study, ''Early Implementation of Public Single-Sex Schools: Perceptions and Characteristics'', which listed the benefits of single-sex schools: (1) Decreases distractions in learning, (2) Reduces student behavior problems, (3) Provides more leadership opportunities, (4) Promotes a sense of community among students and staff, (5) Improves student self-esteem, (6) Addresses unique learning styles and interests of boys or girls, (7) Decreases sex bias in teacher-student interactions, (8) Improves student achievement, (9) Decreases the academic problems of low achieving students, (10) Reduces sexual harassment among students, (11) Provides more positive student role models, (12) Allows for more opportunities to provide social and moral guidance, (13) Provides choice in public education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/other/single-sex/characteristics/characteristics.pdf|title=Riordan, C., Faddis, B., Beam, M, Seager, A., Tanney, A., DiBiase R., Ruffin M., Valentine, J. (2008). Early Implementation of Public Single-Sex Schools: Perceptions and Characteristics. Washington D.C.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Later studies===
Australian researchers reported in 2009 that high school students' interpersonal relationships were positively associated with both academic and nonacademic achievement, although the interaction between boys and girls in a majority of cases resulted in less homework done, less enjoyment of school, and lower reading and math scores.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, A. J., Marsh, H. W., McInerney, D. M., Green, J. [http://www.tcrecord.org/Content.asp?ContentId=15593 Young People's Interpersonal Relationships and Academic and Nonacademic Outcomes: Scoping the Relative Salience of Teachers, Parents, Same-Sex Peers, and Opposite Sex Peers]. Teachers College Record. March 23, 2009, 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:North Sydney Girls High School, 2005 swim team.jpg|thumb|200px|An all-girls school swimming team from Sydney]]
A UCLA report commissioned by the National Coalition of Girls' Schools used data from a large national survey of U.S. college freshmen and found stronger academic orientations among women who had attended all-girls, compared to coeducational high schools, but the effects were small and the authors concluded "that the marginal benefits do not justify the potential threats to gender equity brought on by academic sex segregation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heri.ucla.edu/PDFs/Sax_FINAL%20REPORT_Sing_1F02B4.pdf|title=Women Graduates of Single-Sex and Coeducational High Schools: Differences in their Characteristics and the Transition to College|last=Sax|first=Linda|date=March 2009|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' published a study deeply critical of gender-segregated schooling, arguing that the movement towards single-sex education "is deeply misguided, and often justified by weak, cherry-picked, or misconstrued scientific claims rather than by valid scientific evidence".  The study goes on to conclude that "there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex (SS) education improves students' academic performance, but there is evidence that [[sex segregation]] increases gender stereotyping and legitimizes institutional sexism."&lt;ref name="Science1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Halpern | first1 = Diane F. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2011 | title = The Pseudoscience of Single-Sex Schooling | url = | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6050| pages = 1706–1707 | doi=10.1126/science.1205031 | pmid=21940879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of single-sex education, including the authors of the ''Science'' article, argue that it is not single-sex education that is producing positive results but rather, the ability of students who enter such programs and resources of the schools that are responsible.  They also argue that single-sex schooling does not adequately prepare students for adult workplaces and society, where males and females need to respect and communicate effectively with each other. Coeducational schools offer greater opportunity to break down [[sexism|sexist]] attitudes through purposeful interaction with the other sex.  Coeducational schools are also said to create greater feelings of safety and mutual respect among students across the gender spectrum.

[[Leonard Sax]], the President of National Association for Single-sex Public Education or NASSPE countered the ''Science'' article by saying that "ALL the studies cited in the SCIENCE article regarding 'negative impacts' were in fact studies involving a small number of PRE-SCHOOL students attending a COED pre-kindergarten" (capitalized letters in the original).&lt;ref name="diferenciada.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diferenciada.org/section.php?id=53&amp;id_element=770|title=DIFERENCIADA.org|publisher=|accessdate=2014-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104215357/http://www.diferenciada.org/section.php?id=53&amp;id_element=770|archive-date=2014-11-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further said that "these authors provide no evidence for their substantive claim that 'gender divisions are made even more salient in SS settings.'  In fact, this conjecture has been tested, and proven false, in multiple studies."  Sax cited a study which said that "girls in the all-girls classroom were less aware of 'being a girl' and less aware of gender stereotypes regarding science, compared to girls who were randomly assigned to the coed classroom."&lt;ref name="diferenciada.org"/&gt;

In January 2012, an unpublished study of the University of Pennsylvania, involving a [[randomized experiment]], considered the experiment with the highest level of scientific evidence. The data comes from schools in [[South Korea]], where a law was passed randomly assigning students to schools in their district. The study by Park, Berhman and Choi titled ''Causal Effects of Single-Sex Schools on College Entrance Exams and College Attendance: Random Assignment in Seoul High Schools'' concluded that "Attending all-boys schools or all-girls schools rather than attending coeducational schools is significantly associated with higher average scores."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Hyunjoon|last2=Behrman|first2=Jere R.|last3=Choi|first3=Jaesung|date=2012-01-01|title=Causal Effects of Single-Sex Schools on College Entrance Exams and College Attendance:  Random Assignment in Seoul High Schools|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/psc_working_papers/15/|journal=PSC Working Paper Series|language=en|via=University of Pennsylvania ScholarlyCommons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, E. Pahlke, J. S. Hyde, and C. M. Allison published a meta-analysis comparing achievement and attitudes in single-sex versus coeducational schools that included 1.6 million students in grades K-12.  The study concluded that "there is little evidence of an advantage of SS schooling for girls or boys for any of the outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pahlke|first=Erin|last2=Hyde|first2=Janet Shibley|last3=Allison|first3=Carlie M.|date=2014-07-01|title=The effects of single-sex compared with coeducational schooling on students' performance and attitudes: A meta-analysis.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycarticles/2014-03898-001|journal=Psychological Bulletin|language=English|volume=140|issue=4|pages=1042–1072|doi=10.1037/a0035740|issn=1939-1455|pmid=24491022}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 review of this study Cornelius Riordan observed that the authors "employ a 0.2 effect-size threshold in drawing these conclusions about there being no advantage to single-sex schooling. Despite the above conclusion, the research found that, in a separate analysis of just the best studies (well controlled) conducted in America, the effect size in mathematics was 0.14 for both boys and girls. The verbal performance was 0.22 for girls and 0.13 for boys.... Educational research has shown that a standard effect size of 0.10 on gains from sophomore to senior year of high school is equivalent to one full year of learning by the average public school student in the United States." Thus, he says, that "Applying this standard, a difference of 0.10 (or greater) between students in single-sex and in coeducational schools would be substantially important."&lt;ref&gt;Riordan, Cornelius, ''Schools, Single-Sex''. Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], most single sex schools are fee paying independent or Catholic schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/2f762f95845417aeca25706c00834efa/80fbc4826c05c115ca2570ec001b193c!OpenDocument |title=Australian Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a small number of single sex government schools, while within the independent sector the proportion of pupils attending single sex schools has dropped   from 31% in 1985 to 24% in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncgs.org/Pdfs/Resources/single-sex%20education%20in%20the%20UK%20and%20other%20English%20speaking%20countries.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712212556/http://www.ncgs.org/Pdfs/Resources/single-sex%20education%20in%20the%20UK%20and%20other%20English%20speaking%20countries.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, single sex education in Australia is much more popular than in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/education/no-benefit-to-singlesex-education-australian-psychological-society-congress-to-be-told-20160913-greydj.html|title=No benefit to single-sex education, Australian Psychological Society Congress to be told|first=Eryk|last=Bagshaw|date=13 September 2016|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001, the Australian Council for Educational Research after six years of study of more 270,000 students, in 53 academic subjects, showed that boys and girls from single-sex classrooms "scored on average 15 to 22 percentile ranks higher than did boys and girls in coeducational settings. The report also documented that boys and girls in single-sex schools were more likely to be better behaved and to find learning more enjoyable and the curriculum more relevant.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genderdifferences.org/research-singlesexvscoed.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126230247/http://www.genderdifferences.org/research-singlesexvscoed.htm |archivedate=2007-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
In [[Bangladesh]], a large number of city schools and [[college]]s are single-sex institutions except for universities. Notable all Cantonment schools (non-residential schools run directly by Military), Zilla Schools (run directly by Government [First starting in early colonial ages]), Cadet colleges (residential schools run directly by Military) are single-sex schools.

===India===
In India, boys are said to do better in single-sex classrooms because of the varying educational needs of boys when compared to girls. However, the number of single-sex state schools has dropped substantially over the past 40 years, from 2,500 to 400. Figures indicate that, as of 2002, 53%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smilefoundationindia.org/ourchildren.htm |title=Our Children |publisher=Smile Foundation |accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; of girls in the Indian population actually attend schools. Some conservative parents may decide to withdraw their daughters at the age of puberty onset because of fear of distraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Divya A |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-11-09/view-from-venus/27920229_1_free-education-schools-girls |title=Same-sex classrooms a problem or solution? |publisher=The Times of India |date=2008-11-09 |accessdate=2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that by having single-sex classrooms the students will be able to focus more on their education, as they will not have the distraction of the other sex. The study argues that co-education schools provide opportunities for students to interact with their peers which de-stresses students and creates a friendlier, more relaxed environment.

===Ireland===
[[File:Group_Pictures_(6441868855).jpg|thumb|left|Male students, De La Salle College, County Waterford, 1923]]
A country with conservative traditions, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] has significantly more pupils studying in  single-sex schools than other western countries: more than one third of second level schools are single sex. Even at primary level, single sex education is quite common: 17% of primary school children attend single-sex schools.&lt;ref name="rte.ie"/&gt;

===Middle East===
[[File:Iraqi_schoolgirls.jpg|thumb|School girls in [[Iraq]]]]
In the [[Middle East]] public schools are all gender-segregated, whereas private schools are coeducational. There are single-sex private schools as well. In Iran, single-sex public schools have been in place since the [[Islamic Revolution]]. Universities are mostly coeducational in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/adventuredivas/iran/groundwork/index.html|title=AdventureDivas: IRAN: Groundwork&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Arab Emirates]], private schools are mostly coeducational, while public schools are segregated.

In [[Syria]], private schools are coeducational, while public schools are mostly, but not exclusively, segregated. Universities are all coeducational.

In [[Israel]] the public schools (both secular and orthodox) are coeducational. Ultraorthodox as well as a few other private religious schools are single-sex.

In [[Lebanon]] most schools are coeducational schools

===Nigeria===
In Nigeria, public opinion regarding sexes in schools is influenced most by religious and cultural beliefs rather than the idea that students learn better separated into sexes. Because of this, the attitude towards the separation/integration of sexes varies depending on the ethnic makeup of the region. People in northern Nigeria are mostly Muslim and as a result, are more inclined to choose single-sex education over co-education in-line with their religious beliefs. However country-wide, co-education schools are more common than single-sex schools.

In contrast to the predominance of co-education schools, many prestigious educational institutions only accept one sex, major examples are, [[King's College, Lagos|King's College]] and [[Queen's College, Lagos|Queen's College]] situated in Lagos. At university level, although the sexes are not separated in the classroom, it is common practice to employ a single sex housing policy on university campuses e.g. [[Covenant University]].

===Pakistan===
Most of the private schools in [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]], [[Hyderabad, Pakistan|Hyderabad]], [[Islamabad]] and [[Rawalpindi]] are co-education but government schools are all single-sex education. Most colleges are also single-sex education institutions till graduation. There is one women's university in Rawalpindi as well. A few other universities also offer degree courses separately to both genders. In some cities, single-sex education is preferred, like [[Peshawar]] and [[Quetta]], where many schools are single-sex educational, but there are also schools which are co-educational. However, most of the higher education in Pakistan is co-education.

Around 1800, girls' middle-secondary schools begun to appear, and become more common during the 19th century. By the mid 1970s, most of them had been scrapped and replaced with [[mixed-sex education|coeducation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/12/94/34/1994d30d.pdf|title=Flickor och pojkar i skolan - hur jämställt är det?|publisher=Government of Sweden|language=Swedish|page=140|date=2009|accessdate=29 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915155300/http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/12/94/34/1994d30d.pdf|archive-date=2011-09-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By a law from 1575, girls as well as boys were expected to be given elementary schooling. The establishment for girl schools were left to each city's own authorities, and no school for girls were founded until the [[Rudbeckii flickskola]] in 1632, and that school were to be an isolated example. However, some schools for boys did occasionally accept female students, even on high levels: Ursula Agricola and [[Maria Jonae Palmgren]] were accepted at Visingsö [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in 1644 and 1645 respectively, and [[Aurora Liljenroth]] graduated from the same school in 1788.

During the 18th century, many girl schools were established, referred to as ''Mamsellskola'' ([[Mamsell]] School) or ''Franskpension'' (French Pension).&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"&gt;Gunhild Kyle (1972). Svensk flickskola under 1800-talet. Göteborg: Kvinnohistoriskt arkiv. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; These schools could normally be classified as [[finishing school]]s, with only a shallow education of polite conversation in French, embroidery, piano playing and other accomplishments, and the purpose was only to give the students a suitable minimum education to be a lady, a wife and a mother.&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"/&gt;

In the first half of the 19th century, a growing discontent over the shallow education of women eventually resulted in the finishing schools being gradually replaced by girl schools with a higher level of academic secondary education, called "Higher Girl Schools", in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"/&gt; At the time of the introduction of the compulsory [[elementary school]] for both sexes in Sweden in 1842, only five schools in provided academic secondary education to females: the [[Societetsskolan]] (1786), [[Fruntimmersföreningens flickskola]] (1815) and [[Kjellbergska flickskolan]] (1833) in [[Gothenburg]], [[Askersunds flickskola]] (1812) in [[Askersund]], and [[Wallinska skolan]] (1831) in Stockholm.&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"/&gt; During the second half of the 19th century, there were secondary education girl schools in most Swedish cities.&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"/&gt; All of these were private, with the exception of the [[Women's college]] ''[[Högre lärarinneseminariet]]'' in Stockholm from 1861, and its adjacent girl school ''Statens normalskola för flickor''.&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"/&gt;  The [[Girl School Committee of 1866]] organized the regulation of girl schools and female education in Sweden: from 1870, some girl schools were given the right to offer the [[Gymnasium (school)]] level to its students, and from 1874, those girl schools who met the demands were given governmental support and some were given the right to issue professional degrees.&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"/&gt; This was necessary to make it possible for women to enroll at the universities, which had been open to women in 1870, as female students were not accepted in the same schools as male

===United Kingdom===
[[File:MK17840_Eton_College.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Eton College]], a prestigious English independent school for boys]]
While England has a very strong tradition of single-sex education, Scottish education was largely mixed, and Wales introduced dual schools (a girls' side and a boys' side under one roof) in 1889. In England, most secondary education was single-sex until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304595611_Class_and_Religion_Great_Britain_and_Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;

Single-sex schooling was traditionally the norm for secondary schools in most parts of the United Kingdom, especially for private, grammar and secondary modern schools, but most UK schools are now [[coeducational]]. In the state sector of the U.K. education system, the only single-sex junior schools are [[Winterbourne Junior Boys' School]] and Winterbourne Junior Girls' School (both in the [[London Borough of Croydon]]). The number of single-sex state schools has fallen from nearly 2,500 to just over 400 in 40 years. According to [[Alan Smithers]], Professor of Education at [[Buckingham University]], there was no evidence that single-sex schools were consistently superior. A major longitudinal study of over 17,000 individuals examined whether single-sex schooling made a difference for a wide range of outcomes, including academic attainment, earnings, marriage, childbearing and divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/singlesexschools|title=Single-sex schooling - Centre for Longitudinal Studies|date=2013-05-31|publisher=|accessdate=2014-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors found that girls fared better in examinations at age 16 at single-sex schools, while boys achieved similar results at single-sex or co-educational schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sullivan | first1 = A. | last2 = Joshi | first2 = H. | last3 = Leonard | first3 = D. | year = 2010 | title = 'Single-sex Schooling and Academic Attainment at School and through the Lifecourse' | url = | journal = American Educational Research Journal | volume = 47 | issue = 1| pages = 6–36 | doi=10.3102/0002831209350106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Girls rated their abilities in maths and sciences higher if they went to a girls' school, and boys rated their abilities in English higher if they went to a boys' school, i.e. gender stereotyping was weaker in the single-sex sector.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, A. 2009.

Until the 19th century, single-sex education was the norm in the US, although this varied by region. In [[New England]] there was more mixed-sex education than in the South, and girls in New England had more access to education in general. With the generalization of [[elementary education]] in the 19th century, mixed-sex education started to spread rapidly. According to Cornelius Riordan, "By the end of the nineteenth century, coeducation was all but universal in American elementary and secondary public schools (see Kolesnick, 1969; Bureau of Education, 1883; Butler, 1910; Riordan, 1990). However, higher education was usually single-sex, and [[men's college]]s and [[women's college]]s were common well into the 20th century. A form of education strongly associated with sex-segregation is that of [[Catholic schools]], although many Catholic schools today are coeducational. The idea of educating students differently by sex, formally or informally, was common until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.feminist.org/education/pdfs/9%20Single%20Sex.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversy regarding single-sex education in the United States is its association with [[racist]] ideologies in the 1950s in the [[American South]]. After the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) ruled racial segregation in education unconstitutional, therefore paving the way to educating together black and white children, many conservatives reacted very negatively to the idea of black boys and white girls socializing together, potentially leading to [[Miscegenation|interracial romantic couples]]. As such, segregation by sex in schools became quite common during that era across the Southern US, with many single sex educational institutions being established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0125-williams-single-sex-schools-20160125-story.html|title=What's wrong with single-sex schools?

A major event that affected single-sex schooling in the US was when the [[Title IX]] amendments of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]] were passed. The Encyclopedia of Women and Gender explains Title IX as being, "Founded on the premises of equal opportunity, equal access, and full integration, it focused on providing complete access to participation in all functions of schooling, regardless of gender" (Sex Segregation In Education, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex Segregation in Education|year=2001|location=Encyclopedia of Women and Gender}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many feminists fought for the passage of this law. The goal was to ban all sex discrimination in any education program which received financial aid from the government. It was stated specifically on the Department of Education website as, "No person in the US, on the basis of sex, can be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance".

The main cause which led to the start of more public schools having single-sex classes or entire schools was when the reforms to the [[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]] were passed in 2006. Originally Title IX had allowed separation of males and females in certain areas in school prior to the new changes. For example, they were allowed to have single gender classes for physical-education when there were contact sports involved and also for sex-education classes. Kasic (2008) indicates that the new regulations allow nonvocational public schools to still receive funding if they offer single-sex classes or entire single-sex schools, but in order to start these programs they have to have a governmental or educational objective. These programs are also required to be voluntary, so public schools cannot be required to offer these single-sex programs and if they do they cannot force students to participate in them. Diana Schemo explains in a New York Times article, "Until now, publics school districts that offered a school to one sex generally had to provide a comparable school for students of the other sex. The new rules, however say districts can simply offer such students the option to attend comparable coeducational schools" (Schemo, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;2).  Since these regulations were approved the number of public schools offering single-sex programs has been on a steady incline due to the fact that the rules are more flexible.

In the [[United States]], the Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of single-sex public education in the 1996 case of ''[[United States v. Virginia]]''.  This ruling, written by Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] concluded that single-sex education in the public sector is constitutional only if comparable courses, services, and facilities are made available to both sexes.  The [[No Child Left Behind Act]] contains provisions (sections 5131.a.23. and 5131c, 20 U.S.C. section 7215(a)(23), and section 7215(c)) designed by their authors—senators [[Hillary Clinton]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[New York (state)|NY]]) and [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Texas|TX]])—to facilitate single-sex education in public schools.  These provisions led to the publication of new federal rules in October 2006 to allow districts to create single-sex schools and classes provided that 1) enrollment is voluntary, and 2) comparable courses, services, and facilities are available to both sexes. The number of public schools offering single-sex classrooms rose from 4 in 1998 to 540 in 2010, according to the web site of the National Association for Single Sex Public Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/education/25gender.html?ex=1319428800&amp;en=70f2ee029e27c6c3&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|title= Correction Appended|work=[[New York Times]]|author=Diana Jean Schemo|date=2006-10-25|accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education Next and the Program on Education Policy and Governance at Harvard University sponsored a nationwide survey conducted by Knowledge Networks in early 2008. According to the survey, "more than one-third of Americans feel parents should have the option of sending their child to a single-sex school".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatschools.org/find-a-school/defining-your-ideal/1139-single-sex-education-the-pros-and-cons.gs?page=2|title=Single-sex education: the pros and cons|work=GreatSchools|accessdate=2014-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gender segregation in American history ====
[[File:Class_of_1902_Classbook_(1902)_(14595006780).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Smith College]], class of 1902]]
In the United States, gender segregation in schools was initially a product of an era when traditional gender roles categorically determined scholastic, professional, and social opportunities based on sex.  For instance, leading experts supported gender segregation in higher education because they considered it "to be dangerous and inappropriate for women.  Experts claimed that scientific evidence established that women were physically and temperamentally not suited to the rigors of the academy . ... Separate education for men and women paralleled the separate spheres that each was expected to occupy."&lt;ref&gt;Valorjie K. Vojdik, ''Girls' Schools After VMI: Do They Make the Grade?'', 4 Duke J. Gender L. &amp; Pol'y 69, 84 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, colleges and universities did not consider female applicants until the second half of the nineteenth century when the women's rights movement began advocating for gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Nancy Levit, ''Separating Equals: Educational Research and the Long-Term Consequences of Sex Segregation'', 67 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 451, 514 (1999) (discussing historical lack of collegiate opportunities for women).&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to social progression "at the turn of the twentieth century, educators, particularly those in the South, fiercely resisted coeducation in elite all-male colleges, and most of the Ivy League institutions would drag their feet well into the twentieth century before becoming coeducational."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 515 (noting societal reluctance towards implementation of coeducation).  ''See'' ''also'' Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, ''The Myths and Justifications of Sex Segregation in Higher Education: VMI and the Citadel'', 4 Duke J. Gender L. &amp; Pol'y 101, 118 n. 150 ("Columbia . . . remained all-male until 1983.  Yale and Princeton became coeducational in 1969, followed in 1972 by Brown and Dartmouth, and Harvard in 1976.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Importance of history and culture in single-sex education determinations ====

Girls and boys segregation in schools is definitive of a sex-based classification, and, thus, it must be supported by an "exceedingly persuasive justification" to pass constitutional muster.&lt;ref&gt;''J.E.B. v. Alabama'', 511 U.S. 127 (1994) (exercising stricter standard of review for sex-based classifications).&lt;/ref&gt;  In light of this requisite standard, the legality of single-sex educational institutions depends on the accuracy of underlying assumptions and support.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Katharine T. Bartlett et al., ''Gender and Law'' 2 (6th  ed. 2013) (discussing legitimacy of sex-based classifications).&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, it is important to be aware that a majority of research used to advocate the benefits of single-sex education is cloaked in uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 503 ("The touted 'general consensus' about positive education and socialization effects of single-sex education simply does not exist.")&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, proponents "who want to build a case for single-sex education usually draw on ... uncontrolled studies, small samples, and anecdotal evidence; the positive findings are repeated but are not analyzed".&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' (noting proponents' refusal to rely on up-to-date studies).&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, opponents of single-sex education are able to gather tangible support from observable patterns of pervasive gender inequality in other social contexts.&lt;ref&gt;See Nancy Levit, Separating Equals: Educational Research and the Long-Term Consequences of Sex Segregation, 67 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 451, 514 (1999). According to Levit, "Supporters of single-sex education talk about the subject as if it were an isolated matter . . . without the recognition of either how pervasive sex segregation is in other contexts or the historical and cultural connotations attached to segregation. Those who favor single-sex education argue that we can vest it with new meaning.  This myopic optimism ignores the history, social meaning, and impact of segregation."  Id. See also Lucinda M. Finley, Sex-Blind Nation? The Uneasy Legacy of Plessy v. Ferguson for Sex and Gender Discrimination, 12 Ga. St. U. L. Rev. 1089, 1103-04 (1996) (explaining that "separate never really means equal.  All-girls schools usually have fewer academic offerings . . . . Women's sports events frequently offer less prize money.")&lt;/ref&gt;

The diversity of opinions that concurrently support gender segregation in education creates a complex and fragmented dynamic.  The miscellany of proponents includes: conservatives emphasizing innate gender differences, traditionalists favoring rigid gender roles, democrats striving to remedy past discrimination, progressives promoting diversity in academic choices, and feminists championing exclusively female support systems.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Nancy Levit, ''Separating Equals: Educational Research and the Long-Term Consequences of Sex Segregation'', 67 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 451, 452-53 (1999) (detailing rationales of varied proponents).&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the coalition of proponents consists of parties with dissimilar interests, the body of "educational research regarding the efficacy of single-sex schools is mixed at best".&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 454.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, advocates tend to bolster their respective positions by emphasizing specific aspects of educational research without addressing the remaining "array of evidence regarding institutions, structures, and processes that construct views on gender and equality".&lt;ref name="''id.''"&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Although educational research supporting gender segregation in schools is rife with ambiguity, "the social research is absolutely clear that separation on the basis of identity characteristics creates feelings of individual inadequacy and instills beliefs about group hierarchy".&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;

Studies used to make policy or legal arguments in the current debate over single-sex education narrowly "look only at the slice of the social picture that schooling represents".&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Nancy Levit, ''Separating Equals: Educational Research and the Long-Term Consequences of Sex Segregation'', 67 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 451, 511 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  An informed assessment regarding the appropriate role of gender segregation in contemporary and future education developments requires contemplation of potential implications beyond the direct, internal, and immediate influences that single-sex schools stand to exert on students.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' ("The contextual backdrop is missing from the single-sex education debate ... The studies themselves, and those persons using the studies to make political and legal arguments, fail to consider the social context of gender education.")&lt;/ref&gt;  It is undeniable that gender inequality exists, consciously or not, in contemporary social, professional, and domestic hierarchies or relationships.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''  (discussing importance of potential impact on existing gender inequalities). Specifically, "[t]he dimension of sociological evidence regarding sex-exclusivity that is often overlooked in the single-sex schools debate is the very obvious fact of pervasive and persistent sex segregation in all aspects of daily living."  ''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, "[g]ender separatism is so pervasive that it is almost invisible.  It is woven into the fabric of our daily social routines."&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;  Vestiges of past gender segregation and its connotations throughout American history validate questions concerning the likely effects of contemporary institutions of single-sex education on prevailing gender

==== Impact on female citizens' civil rights ====

Assessing the current single-sex education debate through a broad lens realizes contextual factors that effectively constitute the crux of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 454 (recognizing that current discourse fails to consider "the wider body of social science data concerning the role of sex segregation itself in the formation of gender role attitudes").&lt;/ref&gt;  Most discussions regarding the potential effects of single-sex education characterize future students of such institutions as the sole beneficiaries of resulting impacts.  An appropriate assessment, however, considers contextual implications and realizes that female citizens as a class will be the true beneficiaries if single-sex education developments reach fruition.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' ("The American tradition of sex-exclusivity in public education is a legacy that is tied inextricably to the exclusion of women from public and professional life.")&lt;/ref&gt;

If the multitude of diverging interests that influence the single-sex education dispute were distilled, the core concern of the discussion asks whether single-sex education will help remedy past gender discrimination or not.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;  In sum, &lt;blockquote&gt;[Gender] separatism originated in beliefs about innate differences between women and men in inclinations and abilities, sentiments that comported with 'widely held views about women's proper place.'  The existence of segregated higher education was itself, for centuries, a critical factor in the limitation of women's professional opportunities.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;The implications of reviving single-sex education in America could further erode outdated sex stereotypes and, thereby, facilitate gender equality in other social contexts.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Nancy Levit, ''Separating Equals: Educational Research and the Long-Term Consequences of Sex Segregation'', 67 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 451, 454 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  Incorporating the national history of gender segregation allows all sides to balance specious benefits of future students against the potential regression of gender equality in America.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''  "In determining whether sex-exclusive education will remedy existing educational disparities for girls or will aggravate a system of sex role stereotyping, courts must consider the historical and social meaning of sex segregation in American education."  ''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless of the outcome, female citizens will bear the brunt of effects and either reap the reward of societal progression or bear the burden of continued inequity.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' ("Supporters assume that we can vest single-sex education with new social meaning.  What they overlook, though, is the cultural significance that attaches to the relentless sex segregation in all other areas of life.")&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5918">In [[education]], a '''transcript''' is an inventory of the courses taken and grades earned of a student throughout a course of study. There are official transcripts and transcripts which can be made by the student and verified and attested by an authorized person.

== Synonyms ==

A transcript is sometimes referred to as a '''marksheet''', '''marklist''' or '''[[report card]]'''. 

In the [[United States]], a transcript is also called '''Cumulative Record File''' ('''CRF'''), '''permanent record''', or simply '''record'''.

In the European [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS system]], transcripts are called '''Transcript of Records''' ('''ToR''').

== United States ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
In [[United States]] [[education]], a transcript is a copy of a [[student]]'s permanent academic record, which usually means all [[course (education)|course]]s taken, all [[Grade (education)|grade]]s received, all [[Latin honors|honor]]s received and [[Academic degree|degree]]s conferred to a student from the first day of school to the current school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcripts|url=http://www.extension.harvard.edu/exams-grades-policies/transcripts|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A transcript may also contain the number of people in a class, and the average grade of the class.  An official transcript is prepared and sent by the issuing school usually by the  [[Registrar (education)|Student Registrar]] with an original signature of a school official on the school letterhead and is sealed by the school. When students are thinking about changing schools, the cumulative transcripts get mailed from school to school. Transcripts usually consist of grades 9-12 when applying to colleges. Transcripts are most often issued and used at the high school (grades 9-12) and university levels.

=== Holding transcripts ===
Colleges and universities that are owed money by a former student may "hold" the transcript, until they are paid. This may mean that former student cannot resume their education elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2016/06/17/one-simple-way-colleges-should-help-students-debt-right-now/koN0t1ccYhgA3qSYJBpFqK/story.html|title=Boston Globe: Colleges must stop holding student transcripts hostage|last=Swidey|first=Neil|date=June 17, 2016|work=The Boston Globe|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many colleges and universities will not allow a prospective student until receiving communication (in the form of a physical stamp or seal) that the prior school is satisfied with its debt collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/02/opinion/la-oe-lindorff-student-loan-default-20120502|title=LA Times: Holding Student Transcripts Hostage|last=Lindorff|first=Dave|date=May 2, 2012|work=The Los Angeles Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== European Union ==
&lt;!-- [[Tor (disambiguation)]] links to this section --&gt;
In the European [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS system]], a Transcript of Records (ToR) is used to document the performance of a student over a certain period of time by listing the course units or modules taken, the credits gained, and the grades awarded. The Transcript of Records provides a standard format for recording all study activities carried out by students. It is an essential tool for academic recognition.&lt;ref name="ECTS guide"&gt;
[[Directorate-General for Education and Culture]]: [http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/socrates/ects/doc/guide_en.pdf ECTS Users' Guide]. [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]] and the [[Diploma Supplement]], Brussels, 2005, p. 26;&lt;/ref&gt;

Transcript of Records and [[Diploma Supplement|Diploma Supplements]] are a fairly recent development in most European countries. Students who obtained academic degrees in Europe prior to the [[Bologna Process]] of 1999 typically will not have received transcripts or diploma supplements and they cannot be produced retroactively for these students. Even today there are still European universities that are not ready to issue Transcripts or [[Diploma Supplement|Diploma Supplements]]. Unlike in the US, there does not typically exist in Europe a system of schools directly mailing transcripts to other schools, something that also would be problematic in view of European privacy laws.

The ECTS Transcript of Records, created as part of the [[Bologna Process]], preferably includes, along with the local grades, the ECTS grades of the student. It is used for mobile students at two separate moments. First, it must be issued and sent to the host institution by the home institution for all outgoing students before their departure in order to provide information about the course units/modules that they already have completed and the results obtained. Secondly it must be issued and sent by the host institution to the home institution for all incoming students at the end of their period of study.&lt;ref name="ECTS guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ECTS Key features"&gt;
[[Directorate-General for Education and Culture]]: [http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/socrates/ects/index_en.html#8 What are the key documents of ECTS?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918053810/http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/socrates/ects/index_en.html#8 |date=2013-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcript fraud==
Transcript fraud is the alteration of a transcript issued by a legitimate school or university or the forgery of completely fake transcripts.  Transcript [[fraud]] is a growing problem for both educational institutions and employers.  This is related to [[diploma]] fraud, which is the forgery of school or university diplomas.

'''Turnitin''' is a commercial, [[Internet]]-based [[plagiarism detection]] service launched in 1997. [[Universities]] and [[high school]]s typically buy licenses to use the [[software as a service]] (SaaS) website, which checks submitted documents against its database and the content of other websites with the aim of identifying [[plagiarism]]. Results can identify similarities with existing sources, and can also be used in [[formative assessment]] to help students learn to avoid plagiarism and improve their writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264452242_Let_Them_Plagiarise_Developing_Academic_Writing_in_a_Safe_Environment|title=Let Them Plagiarise: Developing Academic Writing in a Safe Environment (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|doi=10.18552/joaw.v1i1.10|date=October 2011|author1=Christopher Ireland|author2=John English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students may be required to submit work to Turnitin as a requirement of taking a certain course or class. The software has been a source of controversy, with some students refusing to submit, arguing that requiring submission implies a [[presumption of innocence|presumption of guilt]]. Some critics have alleged that use of this [[proprietary software]] violates educational [[privacy]] as well as international [[intellectual property|intellectual-property]] laws, and exploits students' works for commercial purposes by permanently storing them in Turnitin's privately held [[database]].

Turnitin's parent company, iParadigms LLC, runs the informational website Plagiarism.org and also offers a similar plagiarism-detection service for newspaper editors and book and magazine publishers called [[iThenticate]]. Other tools included with the Turnitin [[Software suite|suite]] are GradeMark (online grading and feedback) and PeerMark (peer-review services). Turnitin released the WriteCycle Suite on February 3, 2009, which bundles the Originality Checking service with its GradeMark online grading tools and PeerMark tools.{{Technical statement|date=January 2018}} Turnitin released Turnitin2 on September 4, 2010, dropping the "WriteCycle" nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://turnitin.com/static/what_is_new.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704174249/http://turnitin.com/static/what_is_new.html |archivedate=2010-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
The Turnitin software checks for potentially unoriginal content by comparing submitted papers to several databases using a proprietary [[algorithm]]. It scans its own databases, and also has licensing agreements with large academic proprietary databases.

===Student-paper database===
The essays submitted by students are stored in a database used to check for plagiarism. This prevents one student from using another student's paper, by identifying matching text between papers. In addition to student papers, the database contains a copy of the publicly accessible Internet, with the company using a [[web crawler]] to continually add content to Turnitin's archive. It also contains commercial and/or copyrighted pages from books, newspapers, and journals.

===Classroom integration===
Students typically upload their papers directly to the service for teachers to access.  Teachers may also submit student papers to Turnitin.com as individual files, by bulk upload, or as a [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] file. Teachers can also set assignment-analysis options so that students can review the system's "originality reports" before they finalize their submission. A peer-review option is also available.

Some [[virtual learning environment]]s can be configured to support Turnitin, so that student assignments can be automatically submitted for analysis. [[Blackboard Inc.|Blackboard]], [[Moodle]], [[ANGEL Learning|ANGEL]], [[Instructure]], [[Desire2Learn]], [[Pearson Education|Pearson Learning Studio]], [[Sakai (software)|Sakai]], and [[Studywiz]] integrate in some way with the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turnitin.com/en_us/support/integrations/overview |title=Turnitin Integrations |year=2012 |accessdate=July 11, 2012|publisher=iParadigms, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Privacy===
The [[Dalhousie Student Union|Student Union]] at [[Dalhousie University]] has criticized the use of Turnitin at Canadian universities because the American government may be able to access the submitted papers and personal information in the database under the [[USA PATRIOT Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalgazette.ca/?cmd=displaystory&amp;story_id=1050&amp;format=html|title=DSU takes on Turnitin.com|accessdate=2009-03-20|last=McDiarmid|first=Jess|date=2006-03-16|work=Gazette|publisher=Dalhousie University}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mount Saint Vincent University]] became the first Canadian university to ban Turnitin's service partly because of implications of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://excal.on.ca/cms2//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2532&amp;Itemid=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192237/http://excal.on.ca/cms2//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2532&amp;Itemid=2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-07-06|title=Turnitin risks privacy|accessdate=2009-03-20|last=Halfnight|first=Drew |author2=Kristina Jarvis |author3=Josh Visser|date=2006-11-15|work=Excalibur Online|publisher=[[York University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation broken|date=February 2015}}

===Copyright-violation concerns===
Lawyers for the company claim that student work is covered under the theory of implied license to evaluate, since it would be pointless to write the essays if they were not meant to be graded. That implied license, the lawyers argue, thus grants Turnitin permission to copy, reproduce and preserve the works. The company's lawyers further claim that dissertations and [[thesis|theses]] also carry with them an implied permission to archive in a publicly accessible collection such as a university [[library]].&lt;ref name="Turnitin US legal document copyright"&gt;Foley &amp; Lardner, ''Id.'', pp. 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Minnesota Law School]] [[professor]] Dan Burk countered that the company's use of the papers may not meet the fair-use test for several reasons:
*The company copies the entire paper, not just a portion
*Students' work is often original, interpretive and creative rather than just a compilation of established facts
*Turnitin is a commercial enterprise&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Andrea L.; May 17, 2002; [http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i36/36a03701.htm Plagiarism-Detection Tool Creates Legal Quandary]; ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''; retrieved September 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

When a group of students filed suit against Turnitin on that basis, in ''Vanderhye et al. v. iParadigms LLC'', the district court found the practice fell within [[fair use]]; on appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-4th-circuit/1248473.html A.V. et al. v. iParadigms, LLC]'', 562 F.3d 630 (4th Cir. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presumption of guilt===
Some students argue that requiring them to submit papers to Turnitin creates a [[presumption of innocence|presumption of guilt]], which may violate scholastic disciplinary codes and applicable local laws and judicial practice. Some teachers and professors support this argument when attempting to discourage their schools from joining Turnitin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bedfordstmartins.com/technotes/techtiparchive/ttip060501.htm |title=Turnitin.com, a Pedagogic Placebo for Plagiarism |accessdate=2007-01-28 |last=Carbone |first=Nick |year=2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004205113/http://bedfordstmartins.com/technotes/techtiparchive/ttip060501.htm |archivedate=October 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation broken|date=February 2015}}

===WriteCheck===
iParadigms, the company behind Turnitin, runs another commercial website called WriteCheck, where students must pay a fee to have a paper tested against the database used by Turnitin, in order to determine whether or not that paper will be detected as plagiarism when the student submit that paper to the main Turnitin website through the account provided by the school. The economist [[Alex Tabarrok]] has complained that the company "are warlords who are arming both sides in this plagiarism war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/story/2011-09-09/college-cheating-plagiarism/50338736/1 |title=Plagiarism software WriteCheck troubles some educators |accessdate=2011-10-15 |last=Murphy |first=Elizabeth |date=2011-09-09 |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation==
In one well-publicized dispute over mandatory Turnitin submissions, Jesse Rosenfeld, a student at [[McGill University]] declined, in 2004, to submit his academic work to Turnitin.

A few other Canadian universities are currently{{When|date=January 2018}} in the process of either total or partial ban of this service. On March 6, 2006, the Senate at [[Mount Saint Vincent University]] in [[Nova Scotia]] prohibited the submission of students' academic work to Turnitin.com and any software that requires students' work to become part of an external database where other parties might have access to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msvu.ca/senate/2006/MinutesMarch6.pdf|title=Minutes of Meeting|accessdate=2009-03-20|date=2006-03-06|publisher=[[Mount Saint Vincent University Senate]]}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was granted after the students' union alerted the university community of their legal and privacy concerns associated with the use of Turnitin.com and other anti-plagiarism devices that profit from students' academic work.

At [[Ryerson University]] in [[Toronto]], students may decide whether to submit their work to Turnitin.com or make alternate arrangements with an instructor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ryerson.ca/senate/documents/students.doc|title=Turnitin.com Information for Students|accessdate=2009-03-20|date=2006-12-05|publisher=Ryerson University|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930185146/http://www.ryerson.ca/senate/documents/students.doc|archivedate=2012-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2007, with the help of an intellectual property attorney, two students from [[McLean High School]] in [[Virginia]] (with assistance from the Committee For Students' Rights) and two students attending [[Desert Vista High School]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], filed suit in [[United States Circuit Court]] (Eastern District, Alexandria Division) alleging copyright infringement by iParadigms, Turnitin's parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dontturnitin.com/images/iParadigms_Amended_Complaint.pdf|title=A.V., et. al. v. iParadigms, LLC: Amended Complaint for Copyright Infringement|accessdate=2009-03-20|last=Vanderhye|first=R.|date=2007-04-16|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320160405/http://www.dontturnitin.com/images/iParadigms_Amended_Complaint.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a year later, Judge Claude M.

'''''Universe''''' is a black-and-white short [[animated documentary]] made in 1960 by the [[National Film Board of Canada]].  It "creates on the screen a vast, awe-inspiring picture of the universe as it would appear to a voyager through space.  Realistic animation takes you into far regions of space, beyond the reach of the strongest telescope, past Moon, Sun, and Milky Way into galaxies yet unfathomed."

This visualization is grounded in the nightly work of Dr. Donald MacRae, an [[astronomer]] at the [[David Dunlap Observatory]] in [[Richmond Hill, Ontario]], a facility formerly owned and operated by the [[University of Toronto]], Canada, and now operated by the [[Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]].  Using the technology of his era, MacRae prepares his largely manually operated equipment and then photographs, by long exposure, one star.  He actually strikes an arc between iron electrodes and makes a simultaneous exposure, which he can compare to the star's spectrum to determine its movement relative to Earth.

The film was a nominee at the [[33rd Academy Awards]] in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)|Best Documentary Short Subject]] in 1961.

[[Douglas Rain]] did the narration for the English version; the French version was titled '''''Notre univers''''' with narration by [[Gilles Pelletier]]. [[Eldon Rathburn]] composed the musical score.&lt;ref name="coll"&gt;{{cite web|title=Universe|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=10842|work=Collection|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on ''2001''==
After this work, co-director [[Colin Low (filmmaker)|Colin Low]] worked with [[Stanley Kubrick]] on ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.  Kubrick chose ''Universe'' narrator Douglas Rain as the voice of the [[HAL 9000]] computer and also hired [[Wally Gentleman]], who did optical effects for the NFB documentary, to work on ''2001''.&lt;ref name="NFB.ca"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ohayon|first=Albert|title=The 1960s: An Explosion of Creativity|url=http://www.nfb.ca/playlists/albert_ohayon/1960s-explosion-creativity/|work=NFB.ca|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colombo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Colombo|first=John Robert |authorlink= John Robert Colombo | title=1000 Questions About Canada|publisher=[[Dundurn Group]]|page=326|isbn=0-88882-232-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmRI6_3da2sC&amp;pg=PA326&amp;dq=Universe+NFB+2001#v=onepage&amp;q=Universe%20NFB%202001&amp;f=false|date=June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lacey&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/colin-low-a-gentleman-genius-of-documentary-cinema/article29193112/|title=Colin Low: A gentleman genius of documentary cinema|last=Lacey|first=Liam|date=11 March 2016|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kubrick biographer Vincent Lobrutto:

{{Quote|As the film unspooled, Kubrick watched the screen with rapt attention while a panorama of the galaxies swirled by, achieving the standard of dynamic visionary realism that he was looking for. These images were not flawed by the shoddy matte work, obvious animation and poor miniatures typically found in science fiction films. ''Universe'' proved that the camera could be a telescope to the heavens. As the credits rolled, Kubrick studied the names of the magicians who created the images: Colin Low, Sidney Goldsmith, and Wally Gentleman.&lt;ref name=Lacey/&gt;}}

==Release==
[[NASA]] alone ordered over 300 prints of the film.  By 1976, the NFB had sold over 3100 copies of the film, and it was one of the most widely distributed [[educational film]]s ever made.&lt;ref name="Colombo"/&gt;

==Awards==
* [[Academy Awards]] [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)|Best Documentary Short Subject]] – nomination
* [[Canadian Film Awards]] – Film of the Year, Theatrical Short
* [[BAFTA]] – Animated Short
* [[Cannes Film Festival]] – Jury Prize for Animation

[[File:ITT Technical Institute campus Canton Michigan.JPG|thumb|right|Educational institution of this type in [[Canton, Michigan|Canton]], [[Michigan|MI]], United States]]
A '''vocational school''', sometimes also called a '''trade school''', '''career center''', or '''vocational college'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/vocational_schools.html|title=What are Vocational Schools?|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is a type of educational institution, which, depending on the country, may refer to [[secondary education|secondary]] or [[post-secondary]] education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs/web/95024-2.asp|title=Vocational Education in the US|website=nces.ed.gov|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to provide [[vocational education]], or technical skills required to perform the tasks of a particular and specific job. In the case of secondary education, these schools differ from academic high schools which usually prepare students who aim to pursue tertiary education, rather than enter directly into the workforce. With regard to post-secondary education, vocational schools are traditionally distinguished from four-year [[colleges]] by their focus on job-specific training to students who are typically bound for one of the [[skilled trade]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.adeccousa.com/employers/resources/skilled-trades-in-demand/|title=Skilled Trades in Demand (Infographic)|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, rather than providing academic training for students pursuing careers in a [[professional]] discipline. While many schools have largely adhered to this convention, the purely vocational focus of other trade schools began to shift in the 1990s "toward a broader preparation that develops the academic" as well as technical skills of their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Information Literacy in Vocational Education: A Course Model | date=2 Sep 2006 | publisher=White-Clouds.com | url=http://www.white-clouds.com/iclc/cliej/cl23XLH.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
Vocational schools were called "technical colleges" in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.studiesinaustralia.com/studying-in-australia/what-to-study-in-australia/types-of-education/technical-and-further-education|title=Technical and Further Education (TAFE) {{!}}  Study in Australia|work=Studies in Australia|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and there were more than 20 schools specializing in vocational educational training (VET)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtwd.wa.gov.au/training/vocational-education-and-training|title=Vocational education and training  {{!}} Department of Training and Workforce Development|website=www.dtwd.wa.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Only four technical colleges remain, and these are now referred to as "trade colleges". At these colleges, students complete a modified year 12 certificate and commence a school-based apprenticeship in a trade of their choice. There are two trade colleges in Queensland; Brisbane, the Gold Coast, [[Australian Industry Trade College]] and one in Adelaide, St. Patrick's Technical College, and another in Perth, Australian Trades College.

In Queensland, students can also undertake VET at private and public high schools instead of studying for their overall position (OP), which is a tertiary entrance score. However these students usually undertake more limited vocational education of one day per week whereas in the trade colleges the training is longer.

==Canada==
Vocational schools are sometimes called "[[college (Canada)|college]]s" in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vocationalschools.ca/|title=Canadian Vocational Schools &amp; Training Programs|website=www.vocationalschools.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, a college may also refer to an institution that offers part of a university degree, or credits that may be transferred to a university.

In Ontario, secondary schools were separated into three streams: technical schools, commercial or business schools, and collegiates (the academic schools). Those schools still exist; however, the curriculum has changed that no matter which type of school one attends, they can still attend any post-secondary institution and still study a variety of subjects and others (either academic or practical)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/secondary.html|title=Secondary Education|last=Ontario|first=Government of|website=www.edu.gov.on.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In Ontario, the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities have divided postsecondary education into universities, community colleges and private career colleges.

In the Province of Quebec, there are some vocational programs offered at institutions called [[CEGEP]]s (''collège d'enseignement général et professionnel'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/applying/requirements/qc|title=Quebec CEGEPs, colleges and high schools|website=Applying to Undergraduate Studies|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but these too may function as an introduction to university. Generally, students complete two years at a CEGEP directly out of high school, and then complete three years at a university (rather than the usual four), to earn an undergraduate degree. Alternatively, some CEGEPs offer vocational training, but it is more likely that vocational training will be found at institutions separate from the academic institutions, though they may still be called colleges.

==Central and Eastern Europe==
{{main|Education in the Soviet Union}}
In [[Central and Eastern Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schooleducationgateway.eu/en/pub/latest/news/vocational-education-and-train.htm|title=Vocational Education and Training throughout Europe|website=www.schooleducationgateway.eu|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a vocational education is represented in forms of (professional) [[Professional technical school|vocational technical school]]s often abbreviated as PTU and technical colleges (technikum).
;Vocational school (college)
Vocational school or Vocational college ([vyshche] uchylyshche - study school) is considered a post-secondary education type school, but combines coursework of a [[high school]] and [[junior college]] stretching for six years. In Ukraine, the term is used mostly for sports schools sometimes interchangeably with the term college. Such college could be a separate entity or a branch of bigger university. Successful graduates receive a [[specialist degree]].
;PTU
{{main|Professional technical school}}
PTUs are usually a preparatory [[vocational education]] and are equivalent to the general education of the third degree in the former Soviet education, providing a lower level of vocational education (apprenticeship). It could be compared to a trade [[high school]]. In the 1920-30s, such PTUs were called schools of factory and plant apprenticeship, and later 1940s - vocational schools. Sometime after 1959, the name PTU was established, however, with the reorganization of the Soviet educational system these vocational schools renamed into lyceums. There were several types of PTUs such as middle city PTU and rural PTU&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CV%5CO%5CVocational6technicalschools.htm|title=Vocational-technical schools|website=www.encyclopediaofukraine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
;Technicum
{{main|Tekhnikum|Technikum (Polish education)}}
Technical college (technicum) is becoming an obsolete term for a college in different parts of Central and Eastern Europe. Technicums&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=hMCCIJf-yhIC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=Technicums&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zybNHYfGP2&amp;sig=oTJN9ZnDOY09mMI8YlMDQie7Ung&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBw8egh_jbAhXaXSsKHRpMDA84ChDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Technicums&amp;f=false|title=Educational Reform in Post-Soviet Russia: Legacies and Prospects|last=Eklof|first=Ben|last2=Holmes|first2=Larry Eugene|last3=Kaplan|first3=Vera|date=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780714657059|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided a middle level of vocational education. Aside of technicums and PTU there also were vocational schools ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Профессиональные училища) that also provided a middle level of vocational education. In 1920-30s Ukraine, technicums were a (technical) vocational [[institute]]s, however, during the 1930-32s Soviet educational reform they were degraded in their accreditation.
;Institute
Institutes were considered a higher level of education; however, unlike universities, they were more oriented to a particular trade. With the reorganization of the Soviet education system, most institutes have been renamed as technical universities.

==Finland==
[[File:JAMI Lappajärvi 2015-06-18.JPG|thumb|right|Vocational school in [[Lappajärvi]], Finland]]
{{See also|Education in Finland}}
The Finnish system is divided between vocational and academic paths&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/finland-education-school-2011-12|title=26 Amazing Facts About Finland's Unorthodox Education System|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Currently about 47 percent of Finnish students at age 16 go to vocational school. The vocational school is a secondary school for ages 16–21, and prepares the students for entering the workforce. The curriculum includes little academic general education, while the practical skills of each trade are stressed. The education is divided into eight main categories with a total of about 50 trades. The basic categories of education are
* Humanist and educational branch (typical trade: youth- and free-time director)
*Cultural branch (typical trade: artisan, media-assistant)
*The branch of social sciences, business and merchandise (typical trade: vocational qualification in business and administration ({{lang-fi|merkonomi}}))
*Natural science (typical trade: IT worker ({{lang-fi|datanomi}}))
*Technology and traffic (typical trades: machinist, electrician, process worker)
*The branch of natural resources and environment (typical trade: rural entrepreneur, forest worker)
*The branch of social work, health care and physical exercise (typical trade: practical nurse ({{lang-fi|lähihoitaja}}))
*The branch of travel, catering and domestic economics (typical trade: institutional catering worker)

In addition to these categories administered by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Interior provides vocational education in the security and rescue branch for policemen, prison guards and firefighters.

The vocational schools are usually owned by the municipalities, but in special cases, private or state vocational schools exist. The state grants aid to all vocational schools on the same basis, regardless of the owner. On the other hand, the vocational schools are not allowed to operate for profit. The Ministry of Education issues licences to provide vocational education. In the licence, the municipality or a private entity is given permission to train a yearly quota of students for specific trades. The licence also specifies the area where the school must be located and the languages used in the education.

The vocational school students are selected by the schools on the basis of criteria set by the Ministry of Education. The basic qualification for the study is completed nine-year comprehensive school. Anyone may seek admission in any vocational school regardless of their domicile. In certain trades, bad health or invalidity may be acceptable grounds for refusing admission. The students do not pay tuition and they must be provided with health care and a free daily school lunch. However, the students must pay for the books, although the tools and practice material are provided to the students for free.

In tertiary education, there are higher vocational schools (''[[ammattikorkeakoulu]]'' which is translated to "polytechnic" or "university of applied sciences"), which give three- to four-year degrees in more involved fields, like engineering (see [[insinööri (amk)]]) and nursing.

In contrast to the vocational school, an academically orientated upper secondary school, or senior high school ({{lang-fi|lukio}}) teaches no vocational skills. It prepares students for entering the university or a higher vocational school.

A vocational school in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] is a type of [[secondary education]] school&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.education.ie/en/The-Education-System/|title=Irish Education System|work=Department of Education and Skills|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which places a large emphasis on [[vocational education|vocational]] and [[technical education]]; this led to some conflict in the 1960s when the [[Institutes of Technology in Ireland|Regional Technical College]] system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/regional-technical-college-in-cork-is-upgraded-to-institute-1.123679|title=Regional technical college in Cork is upgraded to institute|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; was in development. Since 2013 the schools have been managed by [[Education and Training Board]]s, which replaced [[Vocational Education Committee]]s which were largely based on [[Cities in Ireland|city]] or [[Counties of Ireland|county]] boundaries. Establishment of the schools is largely provided by the state; funding is through block grant system providing about 90% of necessary funding requirements.

Vocational schools typically have [[further education]] courses in addition to the traditional courses at secondary level. For instance, post [[Irish Leaving Certificate|leaving certificate]] courses which are intended for school leavers and pre-[[tertiary education|third level]] education students.

Until the 1970s the vocational schools were seen as inferior to the other schools then available in Ireland. This was mainly because traditional courses such as the leaving certificate were not available at the schools, however this changed with the ''Investment in Education'' (1962) report which resulted in an upgrade in their status. Currently about 25% of secondary education students attend these schools.

==Japan==
In [[Japan]] vocational schools are known as {{Nihongo|''senmon gakkō''|専門学校}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbcjpn.jp/english/guidance/speciality.html|title=What is a Professional Training College (Senmon Gakko)?｜神奈川県川崎市の日本語学校｜（CBC）外語ビジネス専門学校（東京・横浜近郊）|website=www.cbcjpn.jp|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They are a part of Japan's [[higher education]] system. There are two-year schools that many students study at after finishing high school (although it is not always required that students graduate from high school). Some have a wide range of majors, others only a few majors. Some examples are [[computer technology]], [[fashion]] and [[English language|English]].

{{See also|Education in the Netherlands}}
In the Middle Ages boys learned a vocation through an [[apprenticeship]]. They were usually 10 years old when they entered service, and were first called ''leerling'' ([[apprentice]]), then ''gezel'' ([[journeyman]]) and after an exam - sometimes with an example of workmanship called a ''meesterproef'' ([[masterpiece]]) - they were called ''meester'' ([[master craftsman]]). In 1795, all of the [[guilds]] in the Netherlands were disbanded by [[Napoleon]], and with them the guild vocational schooling system. After the French occupation, in the 1820s, the need for quality education caused more and more cities to form day and evening schools for various trades.
In 1854, the society ''Maatschappij tot verbetering van den werkenden stand'' (society to improve the working class) was founded in Amsterdam, that changed its name in 1861 to the ''Maatschappij voor de Werkende Stand'' (Society for the working class). This society started the first public vocational school (''[[Ambachtschool (Amsterdam)|De Ambachtsschool]]'') in [[Amsterdam]], and many cities followed. At first only for boys, later the ''Huishoudschool'' (housekeeping) was introduced as vocational schooling for girls. Housekeeping education began in 1888 with the [[Haagsche Kookschool]] in [[The Hague]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nuffic.nl/en/study-and-work-in-holland/dutch-education-system/vocational-education-and-training-vet|title=Vocational education and training (VET) — Nuffic English|website=www.nuffic.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1968 the law called the ''Mammoetwet''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://isgeschiedenis.nl/nieuws/mammoetwet-van-1968|title=Mammoetwet van 1968|date=2012-06-14|work=IsGeschiedenis|access-date=2018-06-29|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; changed all of this, effectively dissolving the Ambachtsschool and the Huishoudschool. The name was changed to LTS (''lagere technische school'', lower technical school), where mainly boys went because of its technical nature, and the other option, where most girls went, was LBO (''lager beroepsonderwijs'', lower vocational education). In 1992 both LTS and LBO changed to VBO (''voorbereidend beroepsonderwijs'', preparatory vocational education) and since 1999 VBO together with MAVO (''middelbaar algemeen voortgezet onderwijs'', intermediate general secondary education) changed to the current VMBO (''voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs'', preparatory intermediate vocational education).

==United States==
{{Main|Vocational education in the United States}}

In the [[United States]], there is a very large difference between career college and vocational college. The term ''career college'' is generally reserved for post-secondary for-profit institutions. Conversely, vocational schools are government-owned or at least government-supported institutions, occupy two full years of study, and their credits are by and large accepted elsewhere in the academic world and in some instances such as [[charter school|charter academies]] or [[magnet school]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://magnet.edu/about/what-are-magnet-schools|title=What are Magnet Schools  –  Magnet Schools of America|last=America|first=Magnet Schools of|website=magnet.edu|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; may take the place of the final years of [[high school]].

Career colleges on the other hand are generally not government supported in any capacity, occupy periods of study less than a year, and their training and certifications are rarely recognized by the larger academic world. In addition, as most career colleges are [[private school]]s, this group may be further subdivided into non-profit schools and proprietary schools, operated for the sole economic benefit of their owners.

As a result of this emphasis on the commercialization of education, a widespread poor reputation for quality was retained by a great number of career colleges for over promising what the job prospects for their graduates would actually be in their field of study upon completion of their program, and for emphasizing the number of careers from which a student could choose.

Even though the popularity of career colleges has exploded in recent years, the number of government-sponsored vocational schools in the United States has decreased significantly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/business/vocational-schools-face-deep-cuts-in-federal-funding.html|title=Vocational Schools Face Deep Cuts in Federal Funding|last=Rich|first=Motoko|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The [[Association for Career and Technical Education]] (ACTE) is the largest American national education association dedicated to the advancement of career and technical education or vocational education that prepares youth and adults for careers.

Earlier vocational schools such as [[California Institute of Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''WikiEducator''' is an international online community project for the collaborative development of learning materials, which educators are free to reuse, adapt and share without restriction. WikiEducator was launched in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Invites_Users_to_Take_Part_in_Open,_Collaborative_Video_Experiment | title = Article from wikimediafoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.csir.co.za/enews/2008_aug/ic_02.html | title = Article from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) website}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by the non-profit [[Open Education Resource Foundation]] (OER).&lt;ref name="COL1"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.col.org/news/Connections/2009jun/Pages/News.aspx| title = News from Commonwealth of Learning portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of learning resources are available on WikiEducator: direct instructional resources such as lesson plans and full courses, as well as learning-support resources, such as individual school portals and funding proposals.

WikiEducator's stated goal is to build a thriving and sustainable global community dedicated to the design, development and delivery of free content for learning in realisation of a free version of the education curriculum by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.wikieducator.org/WikiEducator:About#Strategy | title = About Wikieducator Strategy | date = 2008-10-29 | publisher = Wikieducator}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.canada.com/northshorenews/news/story.html?id=bfe6fdde-f3c8-4994-9c41-39c11f2ab085 | title = Taking knowledge around the globe | date = 2008-11-02 | publisher = north shore news}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project purports to focus on building capacity in the use of [[MediaWiki]] and related free software technologies, developing free content for use in educational institutions and elsewhere, facilitating the establishment of community networks and collaboration, and fostering new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://wikieducator.org/WikiEducator:About | title = About WikiEducator | date = 2008-03-11 | publisher = COL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Wayne Mackintosh created the prototype of WikiEducator on a desktop machine, making the very first edit on 13 February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://ww.wikieducator.org/WikiEducator_Early_History | title = Early History of WikiEducator | publisher = Wikieducator}}&lt;/ref&gt; He registered the WikiEducator domain name on 12 February 2006 in [[New Zealand]]. In April 2006, the prototype was moved onto a hosted server with the financial assistance of [[Commonwealth of Learning]] (COL). COL provided sponsorship and leadership for the project, including receipt of a $100,000 grant from [[Hewlett Foundation|The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]] to develop WikiEducator.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.hewlett.org/newsroom/from-greener-cities-to-tools-for-teachers | title = From Greener Cities to Tools for Teachers: Hewlett Foundation Awards $152.1 Million in New Grants | date = 2007-12-18 | publisher = Hewlett Foundation|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 2009, WikiEducator became an independent entity, headquartered at the new International Centre for Open Education at [[Otago Polytechnic]] in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand.&lt;ref name="COL1" /&gt; While COL continues to provide some financial support for WikiEducator, the Open Education Resource  Foundation maintains the technical and operational infrastructure of the WikiEducator community in accordance with the policies approved by the WikiEducator Community Council.&lt;ref name="wikieducator.org" /&gt;

== Participant training ==
WikEducator's training programme is called Learning4Content (L4C).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://wikieducator.org/Learning4Content/About| title = L4C details from WikiEducator}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this initiative, the WikiEducator project arranges free face-to-face as well as online wiki skills and OER development trainings. In return for participants' pledge to develop a learning resource on the wiki, the WikiEducator community supports them in their journey to acquire wiki editing skills and to experience the peer-based model for developing OERs. The WikiEducator community will also certify&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://wikieducator.org/WikiMaster| title = Certification details from WikiEducator}}&lt;/ref&gt; new WikiEducators who request certification of their skills under the L4C initiative.

== Recognition ==
WikiEducator was the inaugural recipient of the MERLOT Africa Network’s award for exemplary open educational resources (OERs) practices in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://man.merlot.org/meetings/MANeLA%20Awards_Win2008_wikiEd.html| title = News page from MERLOT Africa Network’s website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Seltzer Rice''' (June 23, 1873 – August 27, 1963) was an American [[Woodblock printing|woodblock print]] artist, [[Art education|art educator]] and author, associated with the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in [[Northern California]].

== Early life and education ==

Born and raised in [[Manheim, Pennsylvania|Manheim]] in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]], Pennsylvania, Rice grew up with his parents in his grandparent's home on Market Square that had been occupied by his family for four generations.  His parents were John Rice and Sara Seltzer Rice.  His grandfather, Samuel Rice, operated a carriage painting business in a shop at the back of the property.  Interested in painting from a young age, William Rice set up a small studio in the corner of his grandfather's shop.  He took occasional lessons from itinerant painters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Treseder|first=Roberta Rice|title=William S. Rice: California Block Prints|publisher=Pomegranate Communications, Inc|location=Petaluma, CA|year=2009|pages=7–8|isbn=978-0-7649-4803-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing high school, Rice himself began teaching drawing, saving his money to attend art school in Philadelphia, where he lived with a cousin. He won an art school scholarship, and also got a job with the ''Philadelphia Times'' as a staff artist. He began studies in 1893 at the newly founded [[Drexel University|Drexel Institute]], where [[Howard Pyle]] was among his teachers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/william-seltzer-rice/biography|title=William Seltzer Rice Biography|last=|first=|date=|website=ArtNet.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice also attended classes at the [[Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art]], now known as the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]]. There, he began a friendship with [[Frederick Meyer]], a German immigrant who later was hired as art supervisor for the [[Stockton Unified School District|Stockton public schools]].

== Career ==

=== Teaching ===
In 1900, Meyer hired Rice as an assistant art supervisor for Stockton public schools, and Rice relocated to [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], California.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 1902, Meyer moved to [[San Francisco]], and Rice was promoted to Meyer's job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Treseder|first=Roberta Rice|title=William S. Rice: California Block Prints|publisher=Pomegranate Communications, Inc|location=Petaluma, CA|year=2009|pages=8–12|isbn=978-0-7649-4803-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice began a personal exploration of scenic California, visiting [[Yosemite National Park]] in 1901 and [[Lake Tahoe]] in 1904. He also visited all of the [[Spanish missions in California]].

In 1910, Meyer convinced Rice to relocate to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to participate more actively in the Arts and Crafts Movement, and Rice obtained a job teaching art for the [[Alameda Unified School District|Alameda public schools]]. He fraternized with members of the Berkeley Art Colony and contributed his block prints to their ''Exhibition of California Artists'' at the [[Hillside Club]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Jennie V.

Rice spent the rest of his professional career teaching art in the Alameda and [[Oakland Unified School District|Oakland public schools]], including at [[Alameda High School]], [[Fremont High School (Oakland, California)|Fremont High School]] (1919-30), [[Castlemont High School]] (1930-40), and the [[University of California|UC Extension]] evening classes at [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1932-43).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He taught drawing and painting, as well as a variety of crafts, including [[metalworking]] and [[Leather crafting|leather working]]. 

Rice's friend Frederick Meyer had founded the [[California College of the Arts|School of the California Guild of Arts and Crafts]], originally located in Berkeley and later in Oakland. After receiving accreditation, the school was renamed in 1936 the California College of Arts and Crafts and in 2003 became the [[California College of the Arts]].&lt;ref name="edwards" /&gt; Meyer hired Rice to teach summer classes at his school and Rice was able to obtain his B.F.A. in 1929 from the School of the California Guild of Arts and Crafts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.askart.com/artist_bio/William_Seltzer_Rice/9946/William_Seltzer_Rice.aspx|title=Artist Biography for William Seltzer Rice|last=|first=|date=|website=AskArt.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fine art and commercial art ===
He began freelance writing and illustrating for [[Sunset Magazine]].

In 1913, Rice studied design with [[Ralph H. Johonnot]], an associate of [[Arthur Wesley Dow]], who was an early advocate of color block printing in the United States. Rice toured Europe in the summer of 1913, visiting [[Chartres]], [[Rothenberg]] and [[Venice]].

In 1915, Rice married Susan Steel, and they honeymooned at Lake Tahoe, California. That same year, the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition]] took place in San Francisco, and he was impressed by the [[Woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese woodblock prints]] he saw there.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He resolved to become a woodblock print artist. Instead of following the traditional Japanese team method, where an artist did an original painting, who then turned it over to a team of wood carvers and printers, he decided to take control of the entire creative process himself.

In 1918, Rice had his first major exhibition of wood and [[linocut|linoleum]] block prints at the [[Palace of Fine Arts]] in San Francisco, which was designed by [[Bernard Maybeck]] for the Panama Pacific International Exposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Treseder|first=Roberta Rice|title=William S. Rice: California Block Prints|publisher=Pomegranate Communications, Inc|location=Petaluma, CA|year=2009|pages=12–14|isbn=978-0-7649-4803-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gump's]] in San Francisco was one of his leading dealers.&lt;ref name=edwards/&gt; His work was displayed in the printmaker's exhibition at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/art/woo.htm|title=The Significance of Mount Shasta as a Visual Resource - Woodblock Artists: Early 1900s|last=Miesse|first=William C.|date=March 8, 1989|publisher=College of the Siskiyous|accessdate=25 April 2010|location=Weed, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice's artistic collaborators and influences included [[Pedro Joseph de Lemos|Pedro de Lemos]], Elizabeth Norton, [[Roi Partridge]], [[Gustave Baumann]], Lorenzo P. Latimer, [[Norma Bassett Hall]] and the sisters Mary &amp; [[Frances Gearhart]].

Rice's work was featured in a one-man show at [[Villa Montalvo]] in [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]], California in 1959.

== Death and legacy ==

Rice died at his home in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California on 27 August 1963 at the age of 90.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He is buried in his hometown at the Manheim Fairview Cemetery in [[Manheim, Pennsylvania|Manheim]], Pennsylvania.

=== Bibliography ===
Rice wrote two teaching texts, ''Block Printing in the Schools'' (1929) and ''Block Prints: How To Make Them'' (1941), both published by Bruce Publishing Company.
