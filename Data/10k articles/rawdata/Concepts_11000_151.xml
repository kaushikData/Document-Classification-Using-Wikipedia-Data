[[File:PassiveActive.JPG|thumb|310px|In the active transformation (left), a point moves from position P to P' by rotating clockwise by an angle θ about the origin of the coordinate system. In the passive transformation (right), point P does not move, while the coordinate system rotates counterclockwise by an angle θ about its origin. The coordinates of P' in the active case (that is, relative to the original coordinate system) are the same as the coordinates of P relative to the rotated coordinate system.]]

In [[physics]] and [[engineering]], spatial transformations in the 3-dimensional Euclidian space &lt;math&gt;\R^3&lt;/math&gt; are distinguished into '''active''' or '''alibi transformations''', and '''passive''' or '''alias transformations'''. An '''active transformation'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlibiTransformation.html Weisstein, Eric W. "Alibi Transformation." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]] which actually changes the physical position (alibi, elsewhere) of a point, or [[rigid body]], which can be defined in the absence of a [[coordinate system]]; whereas a '''passive transformation'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AliasTransformation.html Weisstein, Eric W. "Alias Transformation." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.]&lt;/ref&gt; is merely a change in the coordinate system in which the object is described (alias, other name) (change of coordinate map, or [[change of basis]]). By ''transformation'', [[mathematician]]s usually refer to active transformations, while [[physicist]]s and [[engineer]]s could mean either. Both types of transformation can be represented by a combination of a [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] and a [[linear transformation]].

Put differently, a ''passive'' transformation refers to description of the ''same'' object in two different coordinate systems.&lt;ref name= Davidson&gt;
{{cite book |title=Robots and screw theory: applications of kinematics and statics to robotics 
|author=Joseph K. Davidson, Kenneth Henderson Hunt 
|chapter=§4.4.1 The active interpretation and the active transformation |page=74 ''ff'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQq67Tr7D0cC&amp;pg=PA74 
|isbn=0-19-856245-4 |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, an ''active transformation'' is a transformation of one or more objects with respect to the same coordinate system. For instance, active transformations are useful to describe successive positions of a rigid body. On the other hand, passive transformations may be useful in human motion analysis to observe the motion of the [[tibia]] relative to the [[femur]], that is, its motion relative to a (''local'') coordinate system which moves together with the femur, rather than a (''global'') coordinate system which is fixed to the floor.&lt;ref name = Davidson/&gt;

== Example ==
[[File:Alias and alibi rotations.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Rotation considered as a passive (''alias'') or active (''alibi'') transformation]]
[[File:Alias and alibi transformations 1 en.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Translation and rotation as passive (''alias'') or active (''alibi'') transformations]]
As an example, let the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v_1,v_2)\in \R^2&lt;/math&gt;, be a vector in the plane.  A rotation of the vector through an angle θ in counterclockwise direction is given by the [[rotation matrix]]:
:&lt;math&gt;R=
\begin{pmatrix}
 \cos \theta &amp; -\sin \theta\\
 \sin \theta &amp;  \cos \theta
\end{pmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
which can be viewed either as an ''active transformation'' or a ''passive transformation'' (where the above matrix will be inverted), as described below.

==Spatial transformations in the Euclidian space &lt;math&gt;\R^3&lt;/math&gt;==
In general a spatial transformation &lt;math&gt;T:\R^3\to \R^3&lt;/math&gt; may consist of a translation and a linear transformation. In the following, the translation will be omitted, and the linear transformation will be represented by a 3×3-matrix &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.

===Active transformation===
As an active transformation, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; transforms the initial vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z)&lt;/math&gt; into a new vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}'=(v'_x,v'_y,v'_z)=T\mathbf{v}=T(v_x,v_y,v_z)&lt;/math&gt;. 

If one views &lt;math&gt;\{\mathbf{e}'_x=T(1,0,0),\ \mathbf{e}'_y=T(0,1,0),\ \mathbf{e}'_z=T(0,0,1)\}&lt;/math&gt; as a new basis, then the coordinates of the new vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}'=v_x\mathbf{e}'_x+v_y\mathbf{e}'_y+v_z\mathbf{e}'_z&lt;/math&gt; in the new basis are the same as those of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=v_x\mathbf{e}_x+v_y\mathbf{e}_y+v_z\mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt; in the original basis. Note that active transformations make sense even as a linear transformation into a different vector space. It makes sense to write the new vector in the unprimed basis (as above) only when the transformation is from the space into itself.

=== Passive transformation ===
On the other hand, when one views &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; as a passive transformation, the initial vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z)&lt;/math&gt; is left unchanged, while the coordinate system and its basis vectors are transformed in the opposite direction, i.e. with the inverse transformation &lt;math&gt;T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;ref name=Amidror&gt;
{{cite book |isbn=1-4020-5457-2 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer |title=The theory of the Moiré phenomenon: Aperiodic layers |first=Isaac|last=Amidror
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_QRomE5g3QC&amp;pg=PT361 |chapter=Appendix D: Remark D.12 |page=346 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This gives a new coordinate system XYZ with basis vectors:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_X=T^{-1}(1,0,0),\ \mathbf{e}_Y=T^{-1}(0,1,0),\ \mathbf{e}_Z=T^{-1}(0,0,1)&lt;/math&gt;

The new coordinates &lt;math&gt;(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the new coordinate system XYZ are given by: 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z)=v_Xe_X+v_Ye_Y+v_Ze_Z=T^{-1}(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)&lt;/math&gt;.

From this equation one sees that the new coordinates are given by
:&lt;math&gt;(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)=T(v_x,v_y,v_z)&lt;/math&gt;.

As a passive transformation &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; transforms the old coordinates into the new ones.

Note the difference between &lt;math&gt;(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(v'_x,v'_y,v'_z)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Alexithymia''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|l|ɛ|k|s|ə|ˈ|θ|aɪ|m|i|ə}} is a personality construct characterized by the [[Wikt:subclinical|subclinical]] inability to identify and describe emotions in the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sifneos PE | year = 1973 | title = The prevalence of 'alexithymic' characteristics in psychosomatic patients | url = | journal = Psychotherapy and psychosomatics | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 255–262 | doi=10.1159/000286529 | pmid=4770536}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core characteristics of alexithymia are marked dysfunction in emotional awareness, social attachment, and interpersonal relating.&lt;ref name = "Feldman"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=FeldmanHall O, Dalgleish T, Mobbs D | year = 2013| title = Alexithymia decreases altruism in real social decisions | url = | journal = Cortex | volume =  49| issue = | pages =  899–904| doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2012.10.015 | pmid=23245426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, people with alexithymia have difficulty in distinguishing and appreciating the emotions of others, which is thought to lead to [[Empathy|unempathic]] and ineffective emotional responding.&lt;ref name="Feldman" /&gt; Alexithymia occurs in approximately 10% of the population and can occur with a number of psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor GJ, Bagby, M.R., Parker, J.D.A.

==Lexicology==
The term ''alexithymia'' was coined by psychotherapists [[John Case Nemiah]] and Peter Sifneos in 1973.&lt;ref name="Duden Medizin"&gt;Stichwort ''Alexi|thymie''. In: ''[[Duden]]. Das Wörterbuch medizinischer Fachausdrücke. Software für PC-Bibliothek.''

Alexithymia. In M. McCallum &amp; W.E. Piper (Eds.) ''Psychological mindedness: A contemporary understanding''. Munich: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates pp. 28–31&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀ-}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|a-}}, 'not') + {{lang|grc|λέξις}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|léxis}}, 'words') + {{lang|grc|θῡμός}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|thȳmós}}, 'heart' or 'emotions'),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/alexithymic|title=alexithymic - definition of alexithymic in English |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |access-date=11 October 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011225303/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/alexithymic |archivedate=11 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; literally meaning "no words for emotions".&lt;ref name="Duden Medizin"/&gt;

==Classification==
Alexithymia is considered to be a [[personality trait]] that places affected individuals at risk for other medical and psychiatric disorders while reducing the likelihood that these individuals will respond to conventional treatments for the other conditions.&lt;ref name=Haviland&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haviland MG, Warren WL, Riggs ML |title=An observer scale to measure alexithymia |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=385–92 |year=2000 |pmid=11015624 |url=http://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/41/5/385#R26732 |accessdate=2007-08-10 |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.41.5.385}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexithymia is not classified as a mental disorder in the  [[DSM-IV|fourth edition of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'']]. It is a dimensional personality trait that varies in severity from person to person. A person's alexithymia score can be measured with questionnaires such as the [[Toronto Alexithymia Scale]] (TAS-20), the [[Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire]] (BVAQ),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vorst HC, Bermond B | year = 2001 | title = Validity and reliability of the Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 413–434 | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00033-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Online Alexithymia Questionnaire (OAQ-G2)&lt;ref name="revneurol.org"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Paula-Perez I | date = Mar 2010 | title = Alexitimia y sindrome de Asperger | url = http://www.revneurol.org/sec/resumen.php?or=web&amp;i=e&amp;id=2009770&amp;vol=50&amp;num=S03 | journal = Rev Neurol | volume = 50 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = S85–90 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727213524/http://www.revneurol.org/sec/resumen.php?or=web&amp;i=e&amp;id=2009770&amp;vol=50&amp;num=S03 | archivedate = 2011-07-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Observer Alexithymia Scale (OAS).&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;  It is distinct from the psychiatric personality disorders, such as [[antisocial personality disorder]] or [[borderline personality disorder]], with which it shares some characteristics, and is likewise distinct from the abnormal conditions of [[sociopathy]] or [[psychopathy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Alexithymia is defined by:&lt;ref name=Taylor29&gt;Taylor (1997), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;
# difficulty identifying feelings and distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal
# difficulty describing feelings to other people
# constricted imaginal processes, as evidenced by a scarcity of fantasies
# a stimulus-bound, externally oriented cognitive style.

In studies of the general population the degree of alexithymia was found to be influenced by age{{How|date=October 2018}}, but not by gender; the rates of alexithymia in healthy controls have been found at: 8.3%; 4.7%; 8.9%; and 7%. Thus, several studies have reported that the prevalence rate of alexithymia is less than 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fukunishi I, Berger D, Wogan J, Kuboki T |title=Alexithymic traits as predictors of difficulties with adjustment in an outpatient cohort of expatriates in Tokyo |journal=Psychological Reports |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=67–77 |year=1999 |pmid=10575975 |url=http://www.japanpsychiatrist.com/Abstracts/Expats1.html |accessdate=2007-08-10 |doi=10.2466/PR0.85.5.67-77 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812013705/http://www.japanpsychiatrist.com/Abstracts/Expats1.html |archivedate=2007-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A less common finding suggests that there may be a higher prevalence of alexithymia amongst males than females, which may be accounted for by difficulties some males have with "describing feelings", but not by difficulties in "identifying feelings" in which males and females show similar abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salminen JK, Saarijärvi S, Aärelä E, Toikka T, Kauhanen J |title=Prevalence of alexithymia and its association with sociodemographic variables in the general population of Finland |journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=75–82 |year=1999 |pmid=10088984 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3999(98)00053-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Psychologist [[R. Michael Bagby]] and psychiatrist Graeme J. Taylor have argued that the alexithymia construct is strongly related (negatively) to the concepts of [[psychological mindedness]]&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Taylor (1997), pp. 77–104&lt;/ref&gt; and emotional intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1997), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00014-3 | last1 = Parker | first1 = JDA | last2 = Taylor | first2 = GJ | last3 = Bagby | first3 = RM | year = 2001 | title = The Relationship Between Emotional Intelligence and Alexithymia | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 107–115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is "strong empirical support for alexithymia being a stable personality [[trait theory|trait]] rather than just a consequence of psychological distress".&lt;ref name="Taylor 1997, p. 37"&gt;Taylor (1997), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Other opinions differ and can show evidence that it may be state-dependent.&lt;ref name=Honkalampi&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Honkalampi K, Hintikka J, Laukkanen E, Lehtonen J, Viinamäki H |title=Alexithymia and depression: a prospective study of patients with major depressive disorder |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=229–34 |year=2001 |pmid=11351111 |url=http://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/42/3/229 |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.42.3.229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagby and Taylor also suggest that there may be two kinds of alexithymia, "primary alexithymia" which is an enduring psychological trait that does not alter over time, and "secondary alexithymia" which is state-dependent and disappears after the evoking stressful situation has changed. These two manifestations of alexithymia are otherwise called "trait" or "state" alexithymia.&lt;ref name="Taylor 1997, p. 37"/&gt;

==Description==
Typical deficiencies may include problems identifying, processing, describing, and working with one's own [[feeling]]s, often marked by a lack of understanding of the feelings of others; difficulty distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal;&lt;ref name=Bar-On/&gt; confusion of physical sensations often associated with emotions; few [[dream]]s or [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] due to restricted [[imagination]]; and concrete, realistic, [[logic]]al thinking, often to the exclusion of emotional responses to problems. Those who have alexithymia also report very logical and realistic dreams, such as going to the store or eating a meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krystal H |title= Alexithymia and psychotherapy |journal=American journal of psychotherapy |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=17–31 |year=1979 |pmid=464164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical experience suggests it is the structural features of [[dream]]s more than the ability to recall them that best characterizes alexithymia.&lt;ref name=Bar-On/&gt;

Some alexithymic individuals may appear to contradict the above-mentioned characteristics because they can experience chronic [[dysphoria]] or manifest outbursts of crying or rage.&lt;ref&gt;Nemiah et al.

According to Henry Krystal, individuals suffering from alexithymia think in an operative way and may appear to be superadjusted to reality. In psychotherapy, however, a cognitive disturbance becomes apparent as patients tend to recount trivial, chronologically ordered actions, reactions, and events of daily life with monotonous detail.&lt;ref&gt;Krystal (1988) pp. 246-247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nemiah | first1 = CJ | year = 1978 | title = Alexithymia and Psychosomatic Illness | url = | journal = Journal of Continuing Education | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 25–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these individuals lack [[imagination]], intuition, [[empathy]], and drive-fulfillment fantasy{{clarify|date=April 2015}}, especially in relation to objects. Instead, they seem oriented toward things and even treat themselves as robots. These problems seriously limit their responsiveness to psychoanalytic psychotherapy; psychosomatic illness or substance abuse is frequently exacerbated should these individuals enter psychotherapy.&lt;ref name=Taylor29/&gt;

A common misconception about alexithymia is that affected individuals are totally unable to express emotions verbally and that they may even fail to acknowledge that they experience emotions. Even before coining the term, Sifneos (1967) noted patients often mentioned things like anxiety or depression. The distinguishing factor was their inability to elaborate beyond a few limited adjectives such as "happy" or "unhappy" when describing these feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sifneos | first1 = PE | year = 1967 | title = Clinical Observations on some patients suffering from a variety of psychosomatic diseases | url = | journal = Acta Medicina Psychosomatica | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 1–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The core issue is that people with alexithymia have poorly differentiated emotions limiting their ability to distinguish and describe them to others.&lt;ref name=Bar-On/&gt; This contributes to the sense of emotional detachment from themselves and difficulty connecting with others, making alexithymia negatively associated with [[life satisfaction]] even when depression and other confounding factors are controlled for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattila AK, Poutanen O, Koivisto AM, Salokangas RK, Joukamaa M | year = 2007| title = Alexithymia and Life Satisfaction in Primary Healthcare Patients | url = | journal = Psychosomatics | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 523–529 | doi=10.1176/appi.psy.48.6.523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
It is unclear what causes alexithymia, though several theories have been proposed.

Early studies showed evidence that there may be an interhemispheric transfer deficit among people with alexithymia; that is, the emotional information from the right hemisphere of the brain is not being properly transferred to the language regions in the left hemisphere, as can be caused by a decreased [[corpus callosum]], often present in psychiatric patients who have suffered severe childhood abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoppe KD, Bogen JE |title=Alexithymia in twelve commissurotomized patients |journal=Psychotherapy and psychosomatics |volume=28 |issue=1–4 |pages=148–55 |year=1977 |pmid=609675 |doi=10.1159/000287057}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] study in 1997 indicated that alexithymia may be due to a disturbance to the right hemisphere of the [[Human brain|brain]], which is largely responsible for processing emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jessimer M, Markham R |title=Alexithymia: a right hemisphere dysfunction specific to recognition of certain facial expressions? |journal=Brain and cognition |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=246–58 |year=1997 |pmid=9220088 |doi=10.1006/brcg.1997.0900}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, another neuropsychological model suggests that alexithymia may be related to a dysfunction of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lane RD, Ahern GL, Schwartz GE, Kaszniak AW |title=Is alexithymia the emotional equivalent of blindsight? |journal=Biol. Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=834–44 |year=1997 |pmid=9347133 |doi= 10.1016/S0006-3223(97)00050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have some shortcomings, however, and the empirical evidence about the neural mechanisms behind alexithymia remains inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tabibnia G, Zaidel E |title=Alexithymia, interhemispheric transfer, and right hemispheric specialization: a critical review |journal=Psychotherapy and psychosomatics |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=81–92 |year=2005 |pmid=15741757 |doi=10.1159/000083166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French psychoanalyst [[Joyce McDougall]] objected to the strong focus by clinicians on neurophysiological at the expense of psychological explanations for the genesis and operation of alexithymia, and introduced the alternative term "[[disaffectation]]" to stand for psychogenic alexithymia.&lt;ref&gt;McDougall (1989), pp. 93, 103&lt;/ref&gt; For McDougall, the disaffected individual had at some point "experienced overwhelming emotion that threatened to attack their sense of integrity and identity", to which they applied psychological defenses to pulverize and eject all emotional representations from consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;McDougall (1989), pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar line of interpretation has been taken up using the methods of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maclaren K |title=Emotional Disorder and the Mind-Body Problem: A Case Study of Alexithymia |journal=Chiasmi International |volume=8 |pages=139–55 |year=2006 |doi=10.5840/chiasmi2006819}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDougall has also noted that all infants are born unable to identify, organize, and speak about their emotional experiences (the word ''infans'' is from the Latin "not speaking"), and are "by reason of their immaturity inevitably alexithymic".&lt;ref name=McDougall161&gt;McDougall (1985), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this fact McDougall proposed in 1985 that the alexithymic part of an adult personality could be "an extremely arrested and infantile psychic structure".&lt;ref name=McDougall161/&gt; The first language of an infant is nonverbal facial expressions. The parent's emotional state is important for determining how any child might develop. Neglect or indifference to varying changes in a child's facial expressions without proper feedback can promote an invalidation of the facial expressions manifested by the child. The parent's ability to reflect self-awareness to the child is another important factor. If the adult is incapable of recognizing and distinguishing emotional expressions in the child, it can influence the child's capacity to understand emotional expressions.

[[Molecular genetics|Molecular genetic]] research into alexithymia remains minimal, but promising candidates have been identified from studies examining connections between certain genes and alexithymia among those with psychiatric conditions as well as the general population. A study recruiting a test population of Japanese males found higher scores on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale among those with the [[5-HTTLPR]] homozygous long (L) allele. The 5-HTTLPR region on the [[serotonin transporter]] gene influences the transcription of the seretonin transporter that removes serotonin from the [[synaptic cleft]], and is well studied for its association with numerous psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kano|first1=Michiko|last2=Mizuno|first2=Tomoko|last3=Kawano|first3=Yuko|last4=Aoki|first4=Masashi|last5=Kanazawa|first5=Motoyori|last6=Fukudo|first6=Shin|title=Serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphism and alexithymia|journal=Neuropsychobiology|date=1 January 2012|volume=65|issue=2|pages=76–82|doi=10.1159/000329554|pmid=22222552|issn=1423-0224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study examining the [[5-HT1A receptor]], a receptor that binds [[serotonin]], found higher levels of alexithymia among those with the G allele of the Rs6295 [[Gene polymorphism|polymorphism]] within the HTR1A gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gong|first1=Pingyuan|last2=Liu|first2=Jinting|last3=Li|first3=She|last4=Zhou|first4=Xiaolin|title=Serotonin receptor gene (5-HT1A) modulates alexithymic characteristics and attachment orientation|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|date=1 December 2014|volume=50|pages=274–279|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.09.001|pmid=25247748|issn=1873-3360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a study examining alexithymia in subjects with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] found higher alexithymia levels associated with the Val/Val allele of the [[Rs4680]] polymorphism in the gene that encodes [[Catechol-O-methyltransferase]] (COMT), an enzyme which degrades [[catecholamine]] neurotransmitters such as [[dopamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koh|first1=Min Jung|last2=Kang|first2=Jee In|last3=Namkoong|first3=Kee|last4=Lee|first4=Su Young|last5=Kim|first5=Se Joo|title=Association between the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) Val¹⁵⁸Met Polymorphism and Alexithymia in Patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|journal=Yonsei Medical Journal|date=1 May 2016|volume=57|issue=3|pages=721–727|doi=10.3349/ymj.2016.57.3.721|pmid=26996573|issn=1976-2437|pmc=4800363}}&lt;/ref&gt; These links are tentative, and further research will be needed to clarify how these genes relate to the neurological anomalies found in the brains of people with alexithymia.

Although there is evidence for the role of environmental and neurological factors, the role and influence of genetic factors for developing alexithymia is still unclear.&lt;ref name= ReferenceA&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jørgensen MM, Zachariae R, Skytthe A, Kyvik K | year = 2007 | title = Genetic and Environmental Factors in Alexithymia: A Population-Based Study of 8,785 Danish Twin Pairs | url = | journal = Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics | volume = 76 | issue = | pages = 369–375 | doi = 10.1159/000107565 | pmid = 17917473 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A single large scale Danish study suggested that genetic factors contributed noticeably to the development of alexithymia.

[[Traumatic brain injury]] is also implicated in the development alexithymia, and those with [[traumatic brain injury]] are six times more likely to exhibit alexithymia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams C, Wood RL |title=Alexithymia and emotional empathy following traumatic brain injury |journal=J Clin Exp Neuropsychol |pages=1–11 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19548166 |doi= 10.1080/13803390902976940 |laysummary=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mouse-man/201001/traumatic-brain-injury-leads-problems-emotional-processing |laysource=Psychology Today |laydate=January 3, 2010 |volume=32 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogeveen|first1=J.|last2=Bird|first2=G.|last3=Chau|first3=A.|last4=Krueger|first4=F.|last5=Grafman|first5=J.|title=Acquired alexithymia following damage to the anterior insula|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=1 February 2016|volume=82|pages=142–148|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2016.01.021|pmid=26801227|publisher=Elsevier|issn=1873-3514|pmc=4752907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relationships==
Alexithymia creates interpersonal problems because these individuals tend to avoid emotionally close relationships, or if they do form relationships with others they usually position themselves as either dependent, dominant, or impersonal, "such that the relationship remains superficial".&lt;ref name=Vanheule&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanheule S, Desmet M, Meganck R, Bogaerts S |title=Alexithymia and interpersonal problems |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages= 109–17 |year=2007 |pmid=17016830 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inadequate "differentiation" between self and others by alexithymic individuals has also been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blaustein JP, Tuber SB | year = 1998 | title = Knowing the Unspeakable | url = | journal = Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 351–365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1997) pp. 26-46&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study, a large group of alexithymic individuals completed the 64-item Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-64) which found that "two interpersonal problems are significantly and stably related to alexithymia: cold/distant and non-assertive social functioning. All other IIP-64 subscales were not significantly related to alexithymia."&lt;ref name=Vanheule/&gt;

Chaotic interpersonal relations have also been observed by Sifneos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sifneos PE |title=Alexithymia: past and present |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=153 |issue=7 Suppl |pages=137–42 |year=1996 |pmid=8659637 |doi=10.1176/ajp.153.7.137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the inherent difficulties identifying and describing emotional states in self and others, alexithymia also negatively affects relationship satisfaction between couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yelsma P, Marrow S |title=An Examination of Couples' Difficulties With Emotional Expressiveness and Their Marital Satisfaction |journal=Journal of Family Communication |year=2003 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=41–62 |doi=10.1207/S15327698JFC0301_03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 study&lt;ref name="Colin Hesse 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hesse Colin |author2=Floyd Kory | year = 2008 | title = Affectionate experience mediates the effects of alexithymia on mental health and interpersonal relationships | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 793–810 | doi = 10.1177/0265407508096696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; alexithymia was found to be correlated with impaired understanding and demonstration of relational affection, and that this impairment contributes to poorer mental health, poorer relational well-being, and lowered relationship quality.&lt;ref name="Colin Hesse 2008"/&gt; Individuals high on the alexithymia spectrum also report less distress at seeing others in pain and behave less altruistically toward others.&lt;ref name = Feldman /&gt;

Some individuals working for organizations in which control of emotions is the norm might show alexithymic-like behavior but not be alexithymic. However, over time the lack of self-expressions can become routine and they may find it harder to identify with others.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries (2001) "Struggling with the Demon: Perspectives on Individual and Organizational Irrationality"&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexithymia frequently co-occurs with other disorders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3501">'''Algorithmic transparency''' is the principle that the factors that influence the decisions made by [[algorithms]] should be visible, or transparent, to the people who use, regulate, and are impacted by systems that employ those algorithms. Although the phrase was coined in 2016 by Nicholas Diakopoulos and Michael Koliska about the role of algorithms in deciding the content of digital journalism services&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Diakopoulos &amp; Michael Koliska (2016): Algorithmic Transparency in the News Media, Digital Journalism, DOI: 10.1080/21670811.2016.1208053&lt;/ref&gt;, the underlying principle dates back to the 1970s and the rise of automated systems for scoring consumer credit.

The phrases "algorithmic transparency" and "algorithmic accountability"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diakopoulos|first1=Nicholas|title=Algorithmic Accountability: Journalistic Investigation of Computational Power Structures.|journal=Digital Journalism|date=2015|volume=3|issue=3|page=398-415}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes used interchangeably – especially since they were coined by the same people – but they have subtly different meanings. Specifically, "algorithmic transparency" states that the inputs to the algorithm and the algorithm's use itself must be known, but they need not be fair.  "Algorithmic accountability" implies that the organizations that use algorithms must be accountable for the decisions made by those algorithms, even though the decisions are being made by a machine, and not by a human being.&lt;ref name="Dickey"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dickey|first1=Megan Rose|title=Algorithmic Accountability|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/30/algorithmic-accountability/|accessdate=4 September 2017|work=TechCrunch|date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current research around algorithmic transparency interested in both societal effects of accessing remote services running algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workshop on Data and Algorithmic Transparency|url=http://datworkshop.org/|accessdate=4 January 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as mathematical and computer science approaches that can be used to achieve algorithmic transparency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning|url=http://www.fatml.org/|accessdate=29 May 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Federal Trade Commission]]'s Bureau of Consumer Protection studies how algorithms are used by consumers by conducting its own research on algorithmic transparency and by funding external research.&lt;ref name="Noyes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noyes|first1=Katherine|title=The FTC is worried about algorithmic transparency, and you should be too|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2908372/the-ftc-is-worried-about-algorithmic-transparency-and-you-should-be-too.html|accessdate=4 September 2017|work=PCWorld|date=9 April 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Union]], the data protection laws that came into effect in May 2018 include a "right to explanation" of decisions made by algorithms, though it is unclear what this means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=False Testimony |journal=Nature |date=31 May 2018 |volume=557 |issue=7707 |page=612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], ''aufheben'' is used by [[Hegel]] to explain what happens when a thesis and [[antithesis]] interact, and in this sense is translated mainly as "sublate".&lt;ref name="hegel" /&gt;

==Hegel==
In Hegel, the term ''Aufhebung'' has the apparently contradictory implications of both preserving and changing, and eventually advancement (the German verb ''aufheben'' means "to cancel", "to keep" and "to pick up"). The tension between these senses suits what Hegel is trying to talk about. In sublation, a term or concept is both preserved and changed through its dialectical interplay with another term or concept. Sublation is the motor by which the dialectic functions.

Sublation can be seen at work at the most basic level of Hegel's system of logic. The two concepts ''Being'' and ''Nothing'' are each both preserved and changed through sublation in the concept ''Becoming''. Similarly, ''determinateness'', or ''quality'', and ''magnitude'', or ''quantity'', are each both preserved and sublated in the concept ''measure''.

Hegel's [[philosophy of history]] stresses the importance of negative (the antithesis) in history—negative includes wars, etc., but not only. His conception of historical [[progress (history)|progress]] follows a [[dialectic]] spiral, in which the thesis is opposed by the antithesis, itself sublated by the synthesis. Hegel stated that Aufheben is uniquely exempt from the historical process in that it is supposed to be true for all time and never changes or develops further as in ''das absolute Wissen'' ("[[absolute knowledge]]"). The synthesis both abolishes and preserves the thesis and the antithesis, an apparent contradiction which leads to difficulties in interpreting this concept (and to translate ''Aufheben'').{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In Hegel's logic, self-contradiction is legitimate and necessary.

For Hegel, history (like logic) proceeds in every small way through sublation. For example, the Oriental, [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Empires (in which the individual is ignored or annihilated, then recognized, and finally suppressed by the States) are preserved ''and'' destroyed in the [[First French Empire]], which, for Hegel, placed the individual in harmony with the State.

At the level of social history, sublation can be seen at work in the [[master-slave dialectic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hegel |first=Georg |title=The Difference Between the Fichtean and Schellingian Systems of Philosophy |date=1978 |publisher=Ridgeview Pub Co |location=New York |isbn=978-0917930126}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=December 2009}}

Hegel approached the history of philosophy in the same way, arguing that important philosophical ideas of the past are not rejected but rather preserved and changed as philosophy develops.

In Hegel's view, one can always find another thing in [[Human self-reflection|reflective philosophy]] upon which some "absolute" ground relies. With [[Fichte]]'s ultimate ground, the "I" or "[[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]", for example, one can immediately see the reliance upon the "non-I", which allows Fichte to distinguish what he means by the "I". Reflection is circular, as Fichte unapologetically acknowledged.

For Hegel, [[Human self-reflection|reflective thought]] is to be avoided due to its [[Circular definition|circularity]]. It leads to covering the same problems and ground ever and anon for each philosophical generation. It is a ''[[Perennial philosophy|philosophia perennis]].''

Instead, Hegel calls on [[speculative reason|speculative thought]]: two contradictory elements are held together, uplifted and sublated without completely destroying one another. Speculative thought seeks to avoid the [[idealism]] inherent in reflective thought and allows one to think in concrete terms about how things work, both in the present, real world and in history.

==Marx==

{{See also|Historical materialism}}

Marx identifies sublation as the manner in which [[materialism|material]], historical conditions develop. This is in stark contrast to the philosophical [[idealism]] of Hegel, for whom sublation reflects the agency of a specific ''[[Geist]]'' – a concept that has often been translated as "mind" or "spirit".

'''"Between the devil and the deep blue sea"''' is an [[idiom]] meaning a [[dilemma]]—i.e., to choose between two undesirable situations  (equivalent to "[[wiktionary:between a rock and a hard place|between a rock and a hard place]]").

The first recorded citation of "the Devil and the deep sea" in print is in [[Robert Monro]]'s ''His expedition with the worthy Scots regiment called Mac-keyes'', 1637: "I, with my partie, did lie on our poste, as betwixt the devill and the deep sea."

[[File:Black sheep-1.jpg|thumb|A black sheep stands out from the flock.]]
[[File:The Black sheep illustrated by William Wallace Denslow.jpg|thumb|The Black Sheep from a 1901 edition of ''Mother Goose'' by [[William Wallace Denslow]]]]
In the [[English language]], '''black sheep''' is an [[idiom]] used to describe an odd or disreputable member of a group, especially within a [[family]]. The term stems from the genetic effect in [[sheep]] whereby a [[recessive gene]] occasionally manifests in the birth of a sheep with black rather than white coloring; these sheep stand out in the flock and their wool was traditionally considered less valuable.

The term has typically been given negative implications, implying waywardness.&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{ cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9re1vfFh04sC&amp;pg=PA64 | title = American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms |accessdate=2007-11-13 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=978-0-395-72774-4 |author1=Ammer, Christine | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]], the ''black sheep effect'' refers to the tendency of group members to judge likeable ingroup members more positively and deviant [[ingroup]] member more negatively than comparable [[ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] members.&lt;ref name="Marques et al. (1988)"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Marques | first = J. M. |author2=Yzerbyt, V. Y.|author3=Leyens, J. | title = The 'Black Sheep Effect': Extremity of judgments towards ingroup members as a function of group identification | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | year = 1988 | volume = 18 | pages = 1–16 | doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2420180102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
In most [[sheep]], a white fleece is not [[albinism]] but a [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] gene that switches color production off, thus obscuring any other color that may be present.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} As a result, a black fleece in most sheep is [[recessive gene|recessive]], so if a white ram and a white ewe are each [[heterozygous]] for black, in about 25 percent of cases they will produce a black lamb. In fact in most white sheep breeds only a few white sheep are heterozygous for black, so black lambs are usually much rarer than this.

==Idiomatic usage==
The term originated from the occasional black [[sheep]] which are born into a flock of white sheep due to a [[Genetics|genetic]] process of [[recessive trait]]s. Black wool was considered commercially undesirable because it could not be dyed.&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt; In 18th and 19th century England, the black color of the sheep was seen as the mark of the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = Sykes | first = Christopher Simon | title = Black Sheep | publisher = [[Viking Press]] | location = New York | year = 1983 |page=11 |isbn=978-0-670-17276-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage, the expression has lost some of its negative connotations, though the term is usually given to the member of a group who has certain characteristics or lack thereof deemed undesirable by that group.&lt;ref name="black sheep"&gt;{{ cite book | title = The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | year = 1992 |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/black-sheep |accessdate=2008-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Mitford]] described herself as "the red sheep of the family", a [[communist]] in a family of aristocratic [[fascist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/16/061016crbo_books1?currentPage=all "Red Sheep: How Jessica Mitford found her voice" by Thomas Mallon 16 Oct 2007 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The idiom is also found in other languages, e.g. [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. During the [[Second Spanish Republic]] a weekly magazine named ''[[El Be Negre]]'', meaning 'The Black Sheep', was published in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciberniz.com/benegre.htm El be negre (1931-1936) - La Ciberniz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211051525/http://www.ciberniz.com/benegre.htm |date=2013-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same concept is illustrated in some other languages by the phrase "white crow": for example ''belaya vorona'' (белая ворона) in [[Russian language|Russian]] and ''kalāg-e sefīd'' (کلاغ سفید) in [[Persian language|Persian]].

==In psychology==
In 1988, Marques, Yzerbyt and Leyens conducted an experiment where Belgian students rated the following groups according to trait-descriptors (e.g. sociable, polite, violent, cold): unlikeable Belgian students, unlikeable North African students, likeable Belgian students, and likeable North African students. The results provided support that the favorability is the highest for likeable ingroup members and the lowest for unlikeable ingroup members, whereas the favorability of unlikeable and likeable outgroup members is between the both former ones.&lt;ref name="Marques et al. (1988)" /&gt; These extreme judgements of likeable and unlikeable (i.e., deviant) ingroup members, relatively to comparable outgroup members is called "black sheep effect". This effect has been shown in various [[intergroup]] contexts and under a variety of conditions, and in many experiments manipulating likeability and norm deviance.&lt;ref name="Branscombe et al.

===Explanations===
[[File:Mirosław Bałka - Czarny papież i czarna owca (1987)01.jpg|thumb|''Black Pope and Black Sheep'', a sculpture by [[Mirosław Bałka]], 1987]]
A prominent explanation of the black sheep effect derives from the social identity approach ([[social identity theory]]&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)"&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Worchel, S. |author2=Austin, W. G. | title = The Social psychology of intergroup relations. | year = 1979 | publisher = Brooks-Cole | location = Monterey, CA }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[self-categorization theory]]&lt;ref name="Turner et al. (1987)"&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Turner, J. C. |author2=Hogg, M. A. |author3=Oakes, P. J. |author4=Reicher, S. D. |author5= Wetherell, M. S. | title = Rediscovering the Social group: A self-categorization theory. | year = 1987 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Group members are motivated to sustain a positive and distinctive [[social identity]] and, as a consequence, group members emphasize likeable members and evaluate them more positive than outgroup members, bolstering the positive image of their ingroup ([[ingroup bias]]). Furthermore, the positive social identity may be threatened by group members who deviate from a relevant group norm. To protect the positive group image, ingroup members derogate ingroup deviants more harshly than deviants of an outgroup (Marques, Abrams, Páez, &amp; Hogg, 2001).&lt;ref name="Marques et al. (2001)"&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Hogg, M. A. |author2= Tindale, S. | title = Blackwell handbook of social psychology: group processes. | year = 2001 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, Mass }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Eidelman and Biernat showed in 2003 that personal identities are also threatened through deviant ingroup members. They argue that devaluation of deviant members is an individual response of ''interpersonal'' differentiation.&lt;ref name="Eidelman &amp; Biernat (2003)"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Eidelman | first = S. |author2=Biernat, M. | title = Derogating black sheep: Individual or group protection? | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | year = 2003 | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 602–609 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-1031(03)00042-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan and Lambert suggested in 1998 that [[cognitive process]]es such as assimilation and contrast, which may underline the effect, should be examined.&lt;ref name="Khan &amp; Lambert (1998)" /&gt;

===Limitations===
Even though there is widely support for the black sheep effect, the opposite pattern has been found, for example, that White participants judge unqualified Black targets more negative than comparable White targets (e.g. Feldman, 1972;&lt;ref name="Feldman (1972)"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Feldman | first = J. M. | title = Stimulus characteristics and subject prejudice as determinants of stereotype attribution | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | year = 1972 | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 333–340 | doi = 10.1037/h0032313 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linville &amp; Jones, 1980).&lt;ref name="Linville &amp; Jones (1980)"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Linville | first = P.

For instance, the higher the [[Identification (psychology)|identification]] with the ingroup, and the higher the [[entitativity]] of the ingroup, the more the black sheep effect emerges.&lt;ref name="Castano et al. (2002)"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Castano | first = E. |author2=Paladino, M.|author3=Coull, A.|author4=Yzerbyt, V.

[[File:SixteenPlayerSingleEliminationTournamentBracket.svg|thumb|240px|The partially-completed bracket for a 16-player [[single-elimination tournament]]. The quarterfinals have been completed, and the semifinals will be Lisa vs. Ernie, and Andrew vs. Robert.  The final will be between the two semifinal winners.]]

A '''bracket''' or '''tournament bracket''' is a [[tree structure|tree diagram]] that represents the series of games played during a [[knockout tournament]]. Different knockout tournament formats have different brackets; the simplest and most common is that of the [[single-elimination tournament]]. The name "bracket" is [[American English]], derived from the resemblance of the links in the tree diagram to the [[bracket]] punctuation symbol ] or [ (called a "square bracket" in [[British English]]).  The closest British term is '''draw''', although this implies an element of chance, whereas some brackets are determined entirely by [[Seed (sports)|seed]]ing.

In some tournaments, the full bracket is determined before the first match. In such cases, fans may enjoy trying to predict the winners of the initial round and of the consequent later matchups. This is called "[[bracketology]]", particularly in relation to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. This prediction is not possible in tournaments, such as the [[FA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]], in which the pairings for a later round are not made until after the previous round has been played.

==Usage in North America==

Brackets are commonly found in [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major North American professional sports leagues]] and in U.S. college sports. Often, at the end of the regular [[Season (sports)|season]], the league holds a post-season tournament (most commonly called a [[playoff]]) to determine which team is the best out of all of the teams in the league. This is done because often in American professional sports there are at least two different [[Conference (sports)|conferences]], and teams mostly play other teams in their own conference. Examples of this are the [[American Football Conference]] and the [[National Football Conference]] in the [[NFL]], the [[American League]] and the [[National League]] in [[Major League Baseball]], and the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern]] [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Conference]] and the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western]] [[Western Conference (NHL)|Conference]] in the [[NBA]] or [[NHL]].

When there are only two different conferences, there are two sides of the bracket. One conference is on one side, while the other is on the opposite side. Each side is organized according to a team's [[Seed (sports)|seeding]]; higher-seeded teams are matched against lower-seeded teams. Teams that qualify for the post-season tournament only compete against teams in their own conference, until only one team from each conference remains. These two teams, called the conference champions, play each other to determine the best in the league. Other leagues, like the NHL, have two conferences, each of which is divided into divisions, usually by region. In the post-season tournament, only the teams with the best records qualify, with the exception of the division leader (and also #2 and #3 in the division in the NHL) having an automatic entry into the tournament.

Most North American professional post-season tournaments are single-elimination format. If a [[bye (sports)|bye]] is required, the top seeded teams usually get the bye. There is usually no third place match to separate the third and fourth place teams.

The concept is even more visible in college sports, most notably in reference to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]], in which millions of casual and serious fans "fill out brackets"—predict the winners of each game in the tournament—in both formal contests, sponsored by various corporations, and informal betting pools among friends or colleagues. The brackets are much larger than those in North American professional leagues—while no more than 16 teams qualify for the postseason in any major North American league (this is the case in the NBA and NHL), 68 teams (out of over 350) advance to the NCAA men's tournament, with most bracket contests involving 64 of these teams.

'''Child Identity''' is not only a psychological structure, but also a complex subject of contemporary [[humanitarian science]]. Identity formation is a complex process that is never completed. When we research the problems of identity we want to answer questions 'Who we are?', 'Do we choose our identity?', 'Is identity given to us or do we create our own?', etc. In a world of change, children are faced with many questions and struggles as they sort out their multiple identities. Children begin to ask identity questions at an early age. Who am I? Who is my family? Where do I belong? Why does my family celebrate some holidays and not others? These are all standard questions children ask to determine how they fit into their world. 
 
[[Erik Erikson]] (1902–1994) became one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in problem of child identity. The child identity is a complex socio-cultural phenomenon, which includes a variety of representations of a child about themselves, about the world, about his place in this world. The Child Identity is a dynamic construct that is rapidly changing under the influence of the environment, education and family. In childhood, identity is a dependent phenomenon, there are a lot of the unconscious factors are affecting to behavior patterns, relationships child with world. Child Identity formed under influence of various factors and stereotypes.

== History of question ==

[[Erik Erikson]] was one of the first scientists who described the problems of identity of teenagers and [[crisis identity]]. The development of identity was one of Erikson's greatest concerns in his theory. When [http://www.freud.org.uk/education/topic/40053/anna-freud/ Anna Freud] worked with different children, she opened many original forms of their psychological life. For example, she was the first who described phenomenon 'Identification with the Aggressor' (The Ego, 1936). According to her it was a [[defense mechanism]] that was used to “protect the self from hurt and disorganization”.
Anthropologists have most frequently employed the term ‘identity’ to refer to this idea of selfhood in a loosely Eriksonian way (Erikson 1972) properties based on the uniqueness and individuality which makes a person distinct from others. Identity became of more interest to anthropologists with the emergence of modern concerns with ethnicity and social movements in the 1970s. One of the most interesting research about some elements of ethnic, cultural and gender children's identity was described by [[Margaret Mead]]. [[Jean S. Phinney]] developed a three stage model of ethnic identity development (1992) based on research with minority adolescents combined with other ego identity and ethnic identity models.

== Socialization and child identity ==

Societies are shared communities with complex codes and organizational structures. Socialization is the process by which individuals adapt to and internalize the norms, values, customs, and behaviors of a shared social group (see Lutfey &amp; Mortimer, 2006; Parsons, 1951). The degree to which children learn how to participate and be accepted by society has important consequences for their development and future lives. Importantly, the social codes that children and adolescents learn are specific not only to nation-states and regions of the globe, but also to historical periods and social groups within larger societies. The socio-historical context is a critical dimension of the socialization of children and adolescents, both with respect to their status within society (as compared to adults) as well as their social roles.

Child Identity is in its general sense self-awareness and other-awareness; how much child knows about his likes and dislikes, his beliefs about who he is and what he thinks his capabilities are. Identity is one of key part of child's development. As child's sense of self develops, so does her ability to be successful in school and in social relationships. Just as self-esteem is how he feels about himself, identity is how he thinks about herself. A child with a strong sense of identity might state, “I am a short person, I like pizza, and I am funny.” [9]
Relationships with family members, other adults and children, friends and members of his community play a key role in building child identity. Child Identity includes many questions such as problems of [[gender identity]], [[cultural identity]], [[social identity]], [[national identity]] and others forms of identities. ( [http://www.mediate.com/articles/adler3.cfm 1])

== New research directions ==
 
Today there are many new frames for forming identity of a child. The Child Identity is modern ontological construct. For example, hybrid identity is a result of globalization. Therefore we have phenomenon of [http://ckid.com/what-is-a-tck.html third culture kid (TCK, 3CK)] or '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIlpSavAeag children of global nomads]'. Children raised as global nomads can be the offspring of diplomatic, international business, government agency, international agency, missionary, or military personnel, or indeed of people living internationally mobile lives for any professional reason. Typically, global nomads share a unique cultural heritage.
For many global nomads, nationality will form but one part of a complex identity influenced also by the host countries in which they have lived, by the experience of mobility itself, and by a multicultural heritage forged within one or more international expatriate communities.
The internet has become a big part of contemporary children’s life.  In the 21st century, this typically involves engagement in virtual play worlds. As children play video game s, aspects of their real world and virtual identities interact and learning takes place. [http://video.canadianliving.com/2381748104001/How_to_help_your_kids_develop_a_safe_virtual_identity Children’s Construction of Identity] in Virtual Play Worlds (or online child identity) is one of new research aspects of child identity.
[http://digimed-jhi.pbworks.com/f/Stald%2BMobile%2BIdentity.pdf Mobile child identity] is influenced by his (her) use of media, in particular personal communication media such as the mobile phone. On the other hand, it also implies a view of adolescent identity as mobile, changing and developing moment by moment and over time, as very sensitive to changes in the relations between friends and families, and [http://www.childalert.co.uk/article.php?articles_id=365 to the emotional and intellectual challenges experienced and mediated through the use of the mobile phone] (among other factors).

== Development of identity ==
 {{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
Everybody has a sense of self or sense of personal identity. In fact most people have a number of important ways of thinking about themselves that are significant enough to be considered multiple senses of self. The sense of self includes those roles, attributes, behaviors, etc. These sense-of-self associations can be based on any combination of the following occupations, social relationships, familial relationships, abilities/disabilities, spirituality and others.
In the first few hours of life, children can tell one smell from another, one voice from another-and they prefer their mother's smell and voice to all others. Attachment is part of the process of identity formation. As infants grow emotionally close to certain people, they associate how those people smell, touch, sound; in this way, they are able to recognize their "special people" early on.

Children as young as four years old have a sense of self that is based on some salient attributes that the child considers important and is maintained over time, for example, “I am the strongest or fastest boy in my class” or “I am smart; I figure things out easily” or “I am good at helping people”. Identities are often imposed or at least encouraged by environmental or cultural forces.

Children acquire their sense of self and self-esteem slowly as they mature into adolescents. Furthermore, children do not always feel good about themselves or their behaviors in every situation. Identities are developed over time and may change from time to time and place to place. Furthermore, as children interact with their peers or learn to function in school or some other place, they may feel accepted and liked one moment and alienated the next. Emotional stability and acceptance at home and among school staff are important during these times.

“Construction of identity” is rarely a deliberate, self-conscious process. Early in life, sense of self is associated with the security, protection, and acceptance that infants, toddlers, and preschoolers feel when effectively cared for by adults to whom they feel an attachment. By the late preschool years and early school years, sense of self comes to be additionally associated – positively or negatively – with attributes that parents value and model for their children in the way they live their lives. Over the school years, peer values and peer pressure come to play an increasingly influential role in how older children and young adolescents think about themselves. “Cliques” – the “in crowd” versus the “out crowd” – become important components of identity. Identities that have been strongly developed prior to these years often protect against the developmental difficulties associated with these years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59253">'''Climate-friendly gardening''' is [[gardening]] in ways which reduce emissions of [[greenhouse gases]] from [[garden]]s and encourage the absorption of [[carbon dioxide]] by [[soil]]s and [[plant]]s in order to aid the reduction of [[Climate change|global warming]].&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"&gt;{{cite web |last=Union of Concerned Scientists |title=The Climate-Friendly Gardener: A guide to combating global warming from the ground up |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/climate-friendly-gardener.pdf |work=Union of Concerned Scientists |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To be a [[Sustainable living|climate-friendly]] [[gardener]] means considering both what happens in a garden and the materials brought into it and the impact they have on [[land use]] and [[climate]].&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sustainable Gardens |date=2009 |publisher=CSIRO |location=Collingwood, Australia |isbn=9780643094222 |first1=Rob |last1=Cross |first2=Roger |last2=Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardening"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sustainable Gardening |date=2011 |publisher=The Crowood Press |location=Marlborough |isbn=9781847972323 |first=Michael |last=Lavelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Land use and greenhouse gases ==

Most of the excess [[greenhouse gas]]es causing [[climate change]] have come from burning [[fossil fuel]]. But a special report from the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) estimated that in the last 150 years fossil fuels and [[Cement#CO2 emissions|cement production]] were responsible for only about two-thirds of climate change: the other third has been caused by human [[land use]].&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"&gt;{{cite book |title=Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report) |date=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=9780521800839 |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/land_use/index.php?idp=0 |first1=Robert T. |last1=Watson |first2=Ian R. |last2=Noble |first3=Bert |last3=Bolin |first4=N. H. |last4=Ravindranath |first5=David J. |last5=Verardo |first6=David J. |last6=Dokken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three main greenhouse gases produced by [[unsustainable]] land use are [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], and [[nitrous oxide]].&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitigating Climate Change through Food and Land Use"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mitigating Climate Change through Food and Land Use |date=2009 |publisher=Worldwatch Institute |location=Washington, United States of America |isbn=9781878071910 |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/179%20Land%20Use.pdf |first1=Sara J. |last1=Scherr |first2=Sajal |last2=Sthapit}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Black carbon]] or [[soot]] can also be caused by unsustainable land use, and, although not a gas, can behave like greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change.&lt;ref name="Ullstein editor 2011"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Ullstein  |editor-first=Bart |title=Integrated Assessment of Black Carbon and Tropospheric Ozone:  Summary for Decision-Makers |date=2011 |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme and World Meteorological Organisation |isbn=978-92-807-3142-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bond 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bond |first1=T.

=== Carbon dioxide ===

[[Carbon dioxide]], {{CO2}}, is a natural part of the [[carbon cycle]], but human [[land use]]s often add more, especially from [[habitat destruction]] and the [[Tillage|cultivation]] of [[soil]]. When [[woodland]]s, [[wetland]]s, and other natural [[habitat]]s are turned into [[pasture]], [[Arable land|arable fields]], buildings and roads, the [[Soil carbon|carbon held in the soil]] and vegetation becomes extra carbon dioxide and [[methane]] to trap more heat in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"&gt;{{cite book |title=Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report) |date=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=9780521800839 |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/land_use/index.php?idp=0 |first1=Robert T. |last1=Watson |first2=Ian R. |last2=Noble |first3=Bert |last3=Bolin |first4=N. H. |last4=Ravindranath |first5=David J. |last5=Verardo |first6=David J. |last6=Dokken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gardener]]s may cause extra carbon dioxide to be added to the atmosphere in several ways:

* Using [[peat]] or [[potting compost]] containing peat;&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Royal Horticultural Society |title=Peat and the Gardener: Conservation and Environment Guidelines |date=2009 |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society, Wisley, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |title=Towards Sustainable Growing Media: Chairman's Report and Roadmap |date=2013 |publisher=Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), London |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/221019/pb13867-towards-sustainable-growing-media.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=John |title=How to Create an Eco Garden: The Practical Guide to Greener, Planet-Friendly Gardening |date=2011 |publisher=Aquamarine |location=Wigston, Leicester |isbn=978-1903141892}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Buying [[garden furniture]] or other [[wood]]en products made from woodland which has been destroyed rather than taken as a [[Renewable resource|renewable crop]] from [[Sustainable land management|sustainably managed]] woodland;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;
* Digging soil and leaving it bare so that the carbon in soil organic matter is [[Oxidation|oxidised]];&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;
* Using [[power tool]]s which burn [[fossil fuel]] or [[electricity]] generated by burning fossil fuel;&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecological Gardening"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cunningham |first=Sally |title=Ecological Gardening |date=2009 |publisher=The Crowood Press |location=Marlborough |isbn=978 1 84797 125 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using [[patio heater]]s;
* Heating [[greenhouse]]s by burning fossil fuel or electricity generated by burning fossil fuel;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;
* Burning [[Pruning|garden pruning]]s and [[weed]]s on a [[bonfire]];
* Buying [[tools]], [[pesticide]]s, [[Fertilizer|synthetic nitrogen fertilizers]] (over 2 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent is produced in the manufacture of each kilogram of ammonium nitrate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sam |last1=Wood |first2=Annette  |last2=Cowie |title=A Review of Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors for Fertiliser Production |date=2004 |publisher=IEA Bioenergy}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and other materials which have been manufactured using fossil fuel;&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Julian Allwood and Jonathan Cullen 'Sustainable Materials - with both eyes open'"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sustainable Materials - with both eyes open |date=2011 |publisher=UIT |location=Cambridge |isbn=9781906860059 |url=http://www.withbotheyesopen.com/ |first1=Julian |last1=Allwood |first2=Jonathan |last2=Cullen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hammond |first=G.

* Heating and treating [[swimming pool]]s by burning fossil fuel or electricity generated by burning fossil fuel;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;
* [[Irrigation|Watering]] their gardens with [[tapwater]], which has been treated and pumped by burning fossil fuel, with a greenhouse gas impact of about 1&amp;nbsp;kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; water.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Livesley 2010 273–293"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Livesley |first=S. |first2=B. |last2=Dougherty |first3=A. |last3=Smith |first4=D. |last4=Navaud |first5=L. |last5=Wylie |first6=S. |last6=Arndt |title=Soil-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in urban garden systems: impact of irrigation, fertilizer and mulch |journal=Urban Ecosystems |date=2010 |volume=13 |pages=273–293 |doi=10.1007/s11252-009-0119-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantifying the energy and carbon effects of water saving full technical report |date=2009 |publisher=Environment Agency and Energy Saving Trust |url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Publications2/Housing-professionals/Heating-systems/Quantifying-the-energy-and-carbon-effects-of-water-saving-full-technical-report |first1=Alan |last1=Clarke |first2=Nick |last2=Grant |first3=Judith |last3=Thornton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardeners will also be responsible for extra carbon dioxide when they buy garden products which have been transported by vehicles powered by fossil fuel.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;

=== Methane ===
[[Methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, is a natural part of the [[carbon cycle]], but human [[land use]]s often add more, especially from [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] [[soil]], artificial [[wetland]]s such as [[Rice#Environmental impacts|rice fields]], and from the [[Digestion|guts]] of [[livestock|farm animals]], especially [[ruminant]]s such as [[cattle]] and [[sheep]].&lt;ref name="Dave Reay 2010"&gt;{{cite book |title=Methane and Climate Change |date=2010 |publisher=Earthscan |location=London |isbn=978-1844078233 |first1=Dave |last1=Reay |first2=Pete |last2=Smith |first3=Andre |last3=van Amstel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gardener]]s may cause extra methane to be added to the atmosphere in several ways:

* [[Soil compaction|Compacting]] soil so that it becomes anaerobic, for example by treading on soil when it is wet;
* Allowing [[compost]] heaps to become compacted and anaerobic;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harriet Kopinska |author2=Jane Griffiths |author3=Heather Jackson |author4=Pauline Pears |title=The Garden Organic Book of Compost|date=2011|publisher=New Holland|location=London|isbn=9781847734372}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Creating homemade liquid feed by putting the leaves of plants such as [[Comfrey#Fertilizer uses|comfrey under water]], with the unintended consequence that the plants may release methane as they [[Decomposition|decay]];
* Killing pernicious [[weed]]s by covering them with water, with the unintended consequence that the plants may release methane as they decay;
* Allowing [[pond]]s to become anaerobic, for example by adding unsuitable [[fish]] species which stir up sediment that then blocks light from and kills [[Water aeration#Natural aeration|submerged oxygenating plants]].&lt;ref name="Creating a Garden Pond for Wildlife"&gt;{{cite book |title=Creating a Garden Pond for Wildlife |date=2011 |publisher=Freshwater Habitats Trust |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-9537971-2-7 |author=Pond Conservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nitrous oxide ===

[[Nitrous oxide]], N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, is a natural part of the [[nitrogen cycle]], but human [[land use]]s often add more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith (editor) |first=Keith |title=Nitrous Oxide and Climate Change |date=2010 |publisher=Earthscan |location=London |isbn=978-1844077571}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The nitrogen cycle and its influence on the European greenhouse gas balance |date=2011 |publisher=Centre for Ecology and Hydrology |isbn=978-1-906698-21-8 |first1=Mark |last1=Sutton |first2=Stefan |last2=Reis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardeners may cause extra nitrous oxide to be added to the atmosphere by:

* Using synthetic nitrogen [[fertilizer]], for example "weed and feed" on [[lawn]]s, especially if it is applied when plants are not actively growing, the soil is compacted, or when other factors are limiting so that the plants cannot make use of the nitrogen;&lt;ref name="Livesley 2010 273–293"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 20"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change: be part of the solution Focus on: soil management (Fact Sheet 20) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS20_REV_Nov09%20%28final%29.pdf |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 21"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change: be part of the solution Focus on: nutrient management (Fact Sheet 21) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS21_REVOCT09WEB.pdf |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compacting the soil (for example by working in the garden when the soil is wet) which will increase the conversion of [[Nitrate#Uses|nitrates]] to nitrous oxide by soil bacteria;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 20"/&gt;
* Burning garden waste on [[bonfire]]s.

=== Black carbon ===

Black carbon is not a gas, but it acts like a greenhouse gas because it can be [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in the atmosphere and absorb [[Thermal energy|heat]].&lt;ref name="Ullstein editor 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bond 2013"/&gt;

Gardeners may cause extra black carbon to be added to the atmosphere by burning garden [[pruning]]s and [[weed]]s on bonfires, especially if the waste is wet and becomes black carbon in the form of soot.&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt; Gardeners will also be responsible for extra black carbon produced when they buy garden products which have been transported by vehicles powered by [[fossil fuel]] especially the [[Diesel exhaust|diesel]] used in most lorries.

== Gardening to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and absorb carbon dioxide ==

There are many ways in which climate-friendly gardeners may reduce their contribution to climate change and help their gardens absorb [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gardening in the Global Greenhouse: The impacts of climate change on gardens in the UK |date=2002 |publisher=UK Climate Impacts Programme |location=Oxford |citeseerx = 10.1.1.131.6205 |first1=Richard |last1=Bisgrove |first2=Paul |last2=Hadley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners can find good ideas in many other [[Sustainability|sustainable]] approaches:
* [[Agroforestry]];
* [[Forest gardening]];
* [[Orchard]]s;
* [[Organic gardening]];
* [[Permaculture]];
* [[Rain garden]];
* [[Vegan organic gardening]];
* [[Water-wise gardening]];
* [[Wildlife garden]].

== Protecting and enhancing carbon stores ==

=== Protecting carbon stores in land beyond gardens ===
[[File:Woodland and wetland in the New Forest.JPG|thumb|Woodland and wetland in the New Forest, Hampshire]]
[[File:Woodland and trees in Herefordshire landscape.JPG|thumb|Woodland and trees in Herefordshire]]
[[File:Waterbutt in kitchen garden at Charles Darwin's home, Down House, Kent.JPG|thumb|Kitchen garden at Charles Darwin's home, Down House, Kent, showing greenhouse, waterbutt, box hedging and vegetable beds.]]
[[File:Alliums in dry garden at Cambridge Botanic Garden.JPG|thumb|Alliums, lavender, box and other water-thrifty plants in the dry garden at Cambridge Botanic Garden]]

Climate-friendly gardening includes actions which protect [[Carbon cycle#Main components|carbon stores]] beyond gardens. The biggest carbon stores in land are in soil; the two habitat types with the biggest carbon stores per hectare are [[Woodland|woods]] and [[wetland]]s; and woods absorb more carbon dioxide per hectare per year than most other habitats. Climate-friendly gardeners therefore aim to ensure that nothing they do will harm these habitats.

According to Morison and Morecroft&amp;nbsp;(eds.)'s ''Plant Growth and Climate Change'',&lt;ref name="Plant Growth and Climate Change"&gt;{{cite book |title=Plant Growth and Climate Change |date=2006 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=978-14051-3192-6 |first1=James I. L. |last1=Morison |first2=Michael D. |last2=Morecroft}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[net primary productivity]] (the net amount of carbon absorbed each year) of various habitats &lt;!--not encyclopedic: (they don't give a figure for wetlands)--&gt; is:

* [[Tropical forest]]s: 12.5 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year;
* [[Temperate forest]]s: 7.7 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year;
* [[Grassland|Temperate grassland]]s: 3.7 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year;
* [[Cropland]]s: 3.1 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s Special Report ''[[Land use, land-use change, and forestry]]''&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt; lists the carbon contained in different global habitats as:

* Wetlands: 643 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 43 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 686 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Tropical forests: 123 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 120 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 243 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Temperate forests: 96 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 57 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 153 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Temperate grasslands: 164 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 7 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 171 tonnes carbon per hectare;
* Croplands: 80 tonnes carbon per hectare in soil&amp;nbsp;+ 2 tonnes carbon per hectare in vegetation&amp;nbsp;= total 82 tonnes carbon per hectare.

The figures quoted above are global averages. More recent research in 2009 has found that the habitat with the world's highest known total carbon density&amp;nbsp;- 1,867 tonnes of carbon per hectare&amp;nbsp;- is temperate moist forest of [[Eucalyptus regnans]] in the Central Highlands of south-east [[Australia]]; and, in general, that temperate forests contain more carbon than either [[boreal forest]]s or tropical forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keith |first1=Heather |first2=Brendan G. |last2=Mackey |first3=David B. |last3=Lindenmaye |title=Re-evaluation of forest biomass carbon stocks and lessons from the world's most carbon-dense forests |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=2009 |volume=106 |issue=28|doi=
10.1073/pnas.0901970106 |pages=11635–11640 |pmid=19553199 |pmc=2701447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon stores in Britain===
According to Milne and Brown's 1997 paper "Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Great Britain",&lt;ref name="Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Great Britain"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Milne |first1=R. |first2=T. A. |last2=Brown |title=Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Great Britain |journal=Journal of Environmental Management |date=1997 |volume=49 |pages=413–433 |doi=10.1006/jema.1995.0118}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s [[vegetation]] and soil are estimated to contain 9952 million tonnes of carbon, of which almost all is in the soil, and most in [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[bog|peatland]] soil:

* Soils in Scotland: 6948 million tonnes carbon;
* Soils in [[England]] and [[Wales]]: 2890 million tonnes carbon;
* Vegetation in British [[woodland|woods]] and [[plantation]]s (which cover only 11% of Britain's land area): 91 million tonnes carbon;
* Other vegetation: 23 million tonnes carbon.

A 2005 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Climate Change and British Woodland |date=2005 |publisher=Forestry Commission |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0-85538-658-4 |first1=Mark |last1=Broadmeadow |first2=Duncan |last2=Ray |url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcin069.pdf/$FILE/fcin069.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that British woodland soil may contain as much as 250 tonnes of carbon per hectare.

Many studies of [[soil carbon]] only study the carbon in the top 30 centimetres, but soil is often much deeper than that, especially below woodland. One 2009 study of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Carbon cycle#Main components|carbon stores]] by Keith Dyson and others gives figures for soil carbon down to 100&amp;nbsp;cm below the [[habitat]]s, including "Forestland", "Cropland" and "Grassland", covered by the [[Kyoto Protocol]] reporting requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dyson |first1=Keith |first2=A.

===Protecting carbon stores in wetland===

[[File:Symphytum grandiflorum, creeping comfrey, with Cotinus coggygria.JPG|thumb|A ground-cover and rain-garden plant - Symphytum grandiflorum, creeping comfrey (with Cotinus coggygria)]]
Climate-friendly gardeners choose [[peat]]-free [[Potting compost|compost]]s&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; because some of the planet's biggest [[Carbon cycle#Main components|carbon stores]] are in [[soil]], and especially in the [[Bog|peatland]] soil of [[wetland]]s.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s Special Report ''Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry'' gives a figure of 2011 gigatonnes of carbon for global carbon stocks in the top 1 metre of soils, much more than the carbon stores in the vegetation or the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners also avoid using [[tapwater]] not only because of the [[greenhouse gas]]es emitted when fossil fuels are burnt to treat and pump water,&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt; but because if water is taken from wetlands then carbon stores are more likely to be oxidised to [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt;

A climate-friendly garden therefore does not contain large [[Irrigation|irrigated]] [[lawn]]s, but instead includes [[water-butt]]s to collect [[rain]]water; water-thrifty plants which survive on rainwater and do not need watering after they are established; [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s and [[hedge]]s to [[Windbreak|shelter]] gardens from the drying effects of [[Sunlight|sun]] and [[wind]]; and [[groundcover]] plants and [[Mulch#Organic mulches|organic mulch]] to protect the soil and keep it moist.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;242&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;80–82&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardening Without Water"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gardening Without Water: Creating beautiful gardens using only rainwater |date=1999 |publisher=Search Press |location=Tunbridge Wells |isbn=0855328851 |first=Charlotte |last=Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners will ensure that any paved surfaces in their gardens (which are kept to a minimum to increase carbon stores) are [[Permeable paving|permeable]],&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and may also make [[rain garden]]s, sunken areas into which rainwater from buildings and paving is directed, so that the rain can then be fed back into [[groundwater]] rather than going into [[storm drain]]s. The plants in rain gardens must be able to grow in both dry and wet soils.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rain Gardens: Managing Water Sustainably in the Garden and Designed Landscape |date=2007 |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon, USA |isbn=978-0881928266 |first1=Nigel |last1=Dunnett |first2=Andy |last2=Clayden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protecting carbon stores in woodland===
Wetlands may store the most carbon in their soils, but woods store more carbon in their living [[biomass]] than any other type of vegetation, and their soils store the most carbon after wetlands.&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt; Climate-friendly gardeners therefore ensure that any wooden products they buy, such as [[garden furniture]], have been made of wood from [[Sustainable forest management|sustainably managed]] woodland.

=== Protecting and increasing carbon stores in gardens ===
[[File:Juglans major at Cambridge Botanic Garden.jpg|thumb|Juglans elaeopyren, an American walnut, at Cambridge Botanic Garden]]

After [[Carbonate rocks|rocks containing carbonate compounds]], soil is the biggest [[Carbon cycle#Main components|store of carbon]] on land.&lt;ref name="Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry"/&gt;
Carbon is found in [[soil organic matter]], including living organisms ([[Root|plant roots]], [[fungi]], [[animal]]s, [[protist]]s, [[bacteria]]), dead organisms, and [[humus]].&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt;
One study of the environmental benefits of gardens estimates that 86% of carbon stores in gardens is in the soil.&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cameron |first1=Ross W. F. |first2=Tijana |last2=Blanuša |first3=Jane E. |last3=Taylor |first4=Andrew |last4=Salisbury |first5=Andrew J. |last5=Halstead |first6=Béatrice |last6=Henricot |first7=Ken |last7=Thompson |title=The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure |journal=Urban Forestry &amp; Urban Greening |date=2012 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=129–137 |doi=10.1016/j.ufug.2012.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fragaria vesca, wild strawberry.JPG|thumb|Wild strawberries in flower below a British hedge.]]

The first priorities for climate-friendly gardeners are, therefore, to:
* Protect the soil's existing carbon stores;
* Increase the soil's carbon stores.

To protect the soil, climate-friendly gardens:
* Are based on [[plant]]s rather than buildings and paving;&lt;ref name="Ecological Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;
* Have soil that is kept at a relatively stable temperature by [[Windbreak|shelter]] from trees, shrubs and/or hedges;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Matthew |title=New Gardening: How to garden in a changing climate |date=2007 |publisher=Mitchell Beazley and the Royal Horticultural Society |location=London |isbn=9781845333058}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Have soil that is always kept covered and therefore moist and at a relatively stable temperature by [[groundcover]] plants, fast-growing [[green manure]]s (which can be used as an [[Intercropping|intercrop]] in [[kitchen garden]]s of [[Annual plant|annual]] vegetables) and/or [[Mulch#Organic mulches|organic mulches]].&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crawford |first=Martin |title=Creating a Forest Garden: Working with nature to grow edible crops |date=2010 |publisher=Green Books |location=Hartland, Devon |isbn=9781900322621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soil improvement and protection - wood chip mulch at Wisley.JPG|thumb|Mulch of woodchips protecting soil at the Royal Horticultural Society garden at Wisley in Surrey.]]

Climate-friendly gardeners avoid things which may harm soil. They do not tread on the soil when it is wet, because it is then most vulnerable to compaction. They [[Tillage|dig]] as little is possible, and only when the soil is moist rather than wet, because cultivation increases the [[oxidation]] of soil organic matter and produces [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;54–55&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 2013 12"&gt;{{cite book |last=Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |title=Protecting our Water, Soil and Air: A Code of Good Agricultural Practice for farmers, growers and land managers |date=2013 |publisher=The Stationery Office |location=London |isbn=978 0 11 243284 5 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase soil carbon stores, climate-friendly gardeners ensure that their gardens create optimal conditions for vigorous healthy growth of plants, and other garden organisms above and below ground, and reduce the impact of any [[limiting factor]]s.

In general, the more [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] that the plants can create each year, the more carbon will be added to the soil.&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;54–55&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
However, only some biomass each year becomes long-term [[soil carbon]] or humus. In ''Soil Carbon and Organic Farming'', a 2009 report for the [[Soil Association]], Gundula Azeez discusses several [[Environmental factor|factor]]s which increase how much biomass is turned into humus. These include good [[soil structure]], [[Soil biology|soil organisms]] such as fine [[root hair]]s, [[microorganism]]s, [[mycorrhiza]]s and [[earthworm]]s which increase [[Soil#Structure|soil aggregation]], residues from plants (such as trees and shrubs) which have a high content of resistant chemicals such as [[lignin]], and plant residues with a [[carbon to nitrogen ratio]] lower than about 32:1.&lt;ref name="Soil Carbon and Organic Farming"&gt;{{cite book |last=Azeez |first=Gundula |title=Soil Carbon and Organic Farming: A review of the evidence on the relationship between agriculture and soil carbon sequestration, and how organic farming can contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation |date=2009 |publisher=The Soil Association |location=Bristol |url=http://www.soilassociation.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=SSnOCMoqrXs%3D&amp;tabid=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soil fertility - nitrogen fixation by root nodules on Wistaria roots, with hazelnut to show size.JPG|thumb|Nitrogen-fixing nodules on Wisteria roots (hazelnut for scale)]]

Climate-friendly gardens therefore include:

* Hedges for shelter from wind;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
* A light canopy of late-leafing [[deciduous]] trees to let in enough [[sunlight]] for growth but not so much that the garden becomes too hot and dry&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt; (this is one of the principles behind many [[agroforestry]] systems, such as [[Paulownia]]'s use in China partly because it is late-leafing and its [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] is sparse so that [[crop]]s below it get shelter but also enough light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Temperate Agroforestry Systems |date=1997 |publisher=CAB International |location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire |isbn=9780851991474 |author=Yungying Wu |author2=Zhaohua Zhu |pages=170–172 |editor1-first=Andrew M. |editor1-last=Gordon |editor2-first=Steven M. |editor2-last=Newman |chapter=Temperate Agroforestry in China}}&lt;/ref&gt;);
* Groundcover plants and organic mulches (such as [[woodchips]] over [[compost]] made from kitchen and garden "waste") to keep soil moist and at relatively stable temperatures;&lt;ref name="New Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
* [[Nitrogen fixation#Root nodule symbioses|Nitrogen-fixing plants]], because soil nitrogen may be a limiting factor (but climate-friendly gardeners avoid [[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|synthetic nitrogen fertilizers]], because these may cause mycorrhizal associations to break down);&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
* Many layers&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt; of plants, including [[Lignin|woody]] plants such as trees&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and shrubs, other [[Perennial plant|perennials]], groundcover plants, deep-rooted plants, all chosen according to 'right plant, right place',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Nicola |title=Right Plant, Right Place |date=1986 |publisher=Pan |location=London |isbn=0 330 29656 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lancaster |first=Roy |title=Perfect Plant, Perfect Place |date=2010 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location=London |isbn=978-1405348133}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that they are suited to their growing conditions and will grow well;
* A wide [[biodiversity|diversity]] of [[Plant disease resistance|disease-resistant]], vigorous plants for [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] and to make the most of all available [[ecological niche]]s;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;
* Plants to [[Wildlife garden|feed and shelter]] wildlife, to increase total biomass, and to ensure [[Biological pest control|biological control]] of pests and diseases.&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden 54-55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker|first=John|title=How to Create an Eco Garden: The Practical Guide to Greener, Planet-Friendly Gardening|date=2011|publisher=Anness Publishing|location=Wigston, Leicestershire|isbn=9781903141892|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecological Gardening" /&gt;&lt;ref name="How to Make a Wildlife Garden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baines|first=Chris|title=How to Make a Wildlife Garden|date=2000|publisher=Frances Lincoln|location=London|isbn=9780711217119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compost made from garden and kitchen "waste".&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;

Lawns, like other grasslands, can build up good levels of [[soil carbon]],&lt;ref name="Soil Carbon and Organic Farming"/&gt; but they will grow more vigorously and store more carbon if besides [[Lawn#Grasses|grasses]] they also contain nitrogen-fixing plants such as [[clover]],&lt;ref name="Science and the Garden"/&gt; and if they are cut using a [[Lawn mower#Other notable types|mulching mower]] which returns finely-chopped mowings to the lawn. More carbon, however, may be stored by other perennial plants such as trees&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and shrubs. They also do not need to be maintained using [[power tool]]s.

Climate-friendly gardeners will also aim to increase biodiversity not only for the sake of the wildlife itself, but so that the garden ecosystem is resilient and more likely to store as much carbon as possible as long as possible. They will therefore avoid pesticides,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and increase the diversity of the habitats within their gardens.

== Reducing greenhouse gas emissions ==
Climate-friendly gardeners can directly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from their own gardens, but can also use their gardens to indirectly reduce greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere.

=== Using gardens to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ===

Climate-friendly gardeners can use their gardens in ways which reduce [[greenhouse gas]]es elsewhere, for example by using the [[sunlight|sun]] and [[wind]] to dry [[Laundry|washing]] on [[Clothes line|washing lines]] in the garden instead of using [[electricity]] [[Electricity generation|generated]] by [[fossil fuel]] to dry washing in [[Clothes dryer|tumble dryers]].

====From farmland====
[[File:Juglans regia, walnut, with ripening nuts.JPG|thumb|Walnut, Juglans regia, with ripening walnuts]]
Food is a major contributor to climate change. In the United Kingdom, according to Tara Garnett of the [http://www.fcrn.org.uk/ Food Food Climate Research Network], food contributes 19% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Cooking up a Storm"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garnett |first=Tara |title=Cooking up a Storm: Food, greenhouse gas emissions and our changing climate |date=September 2008 |publisher=Food Climate Research Network, Centre for Environmental Strategy, University of Surrey |location=Guildford, Surrey |url=http://www.fcrn.org.uk/sites/default/files/CuaS_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil is the biggest [[Carbon cycle#Main components|store of carbon]] on [[land]]. It is therefore important to protect the [[soil organic matter]] in [[Agricultural land|farmland]]. Farm animals, however, especially free-range pigs, may cause erosion, and cultivation of the soil increases the [[oxidation]] of soil organic matter into [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 2013 12"/&gt; Other sources of greenhouse gases from farmland include: compaction caused by farm machinery or overgrazing by [[Livestock|farm animals]] can make soil [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] and produce [[methane]]; farm animals produce methane; and [[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|nitrogen fertilizer]]s can be converted to [[nitrous oxide]].

Most farmland consists of [[Arable land|fields growing annual arable crops]] which are eaten directly by people or fed to farm animals, and [[grassland]] used as [[pasture]], [[hay]] or [[silage]] to feed farm animals. Some [[Perennial crop|perennial food plants]] are also grown, such as [[fruit]]s and [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s in [[orchard]]s, and [[watercress]] grown in water.

Although all cultivation of the soil in arable fields produces carbon dioxide, some arable crops cause more damage to soil than others. [[List of root vegetables|Root crops]] such as [[potato]]es and [[sugar-beet]], and crops which are harvested not just once a year but over a long period such as [[Leaf vegetable|green vegetables and salads]], are considered "high risk" in [[catchment-sensitive farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |title=Soil Protection Review 2010 |date=2009 |publisher=Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |location=London |pages=21–22 |url=http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/resources/000/145/513/PB13311.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 10"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Focus on arable crops (Fact Sheet 10) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS_REV_FS10_Arable%20crops.pdf |accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners therefore grow at least some of their food,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; and may choose [[Agriculture|food crops]] which therefore help to keep carbon in farmland [[soil]]s if they grow such high-risk crops in small [[Kitchen garden|vegetable plots]] in their gardens, where it is easier to protect the soil than in large fields under [[Commercial agriculture|commercial]] pressures. Climate-friendly gardeners may grow and eat plants such as sweet [[cicely]] which sweeten food, and so reduce the land area needed for sugar-beet.&lt;ref name="Plants for a Future"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fern |first=Ken |title=Plants for a Future: Edible and useful plants for a healthier world |date=1997 |publisher=Permanent Publications |location=Clanfield, Hampshire |isbn=9781856230117}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They may also choose to grow [[Perennial plant|perennial]] food plants to not only reduce their indirect greenhouse gas emissions from farmland, but also to increase carbon stores in their own gardens.&lt;ref name="Creating a Forest Garden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plants for a Future"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hart |first=Robert |title=Forest Gardening |date=1991 |publisher=Green Books |location=Hartland, Devon |isbn=1870098447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toensmeier |first=E. |title=Perennial Vegetables |date=2007 |publisher=Chelsea Green |location=Vermont, United States of America |isbn=9781931498401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grassland contains more carbon per hectare than arable fields, but farm animals, especially [[ruminant]]s such as [[cattle]] or [[sheep]], produce large amounts of [[methane]], directly and from manure heaps and slurry.&lt;ref name="Dave Reay 2010"/&gt; Slurry and manure may also produce nitrous oxide.&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 4"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change series: General ways to mitigate climate change (Fact Sheet 4) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS4_Mitigation_WEB_Oct%202008.pdf |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Gardeners who want to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions can help themselves to eat less [[meat]] and [[dairy produce]] by growing [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] trees which are a good source of [[Umami|tasty]], [[protein]]-rich [[food]], including [[walnut]]s which are an excellent source of the [[Omega-3|omega-3 fatty acid]] [[alpha-linolenic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lyle |first=Susanna |title=Ultimate Fruit &amp; Nuts: A comprehensive guide to the cultivation, uses and health benefits of over 300 food-producing plants |date=2006 |publisher=Frances Lincoln |location=London |isbn=978-0-7112-2593-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers and farmers are investigating and improving ways of farming which are more sustainable, such as [[agroforestry]], [[forest farming]], [[Conservation agriculture|wildlife-friendly farming]], [[soil management]], [[catchment-sensitive farming]] (or water-friendly farming&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Freshwater Habitats Trust |title=Water-Friendly Farming |url=http://www.freshwaterhabitats.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Water-Friendly-Farming-Introduction.pdf |website=Freshwater Habitats Trust |accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For example, the organisation [http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk Farming Futures] assists farmers in the United Kingdom to reduce their farms' greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Farming Futures Fact Sheet 23"&gt;{{cite web |last=Farming Futures |title=Climate change: be part of the solution Focus on energy efficiency (Fact Sheet 23) |url=http://www.farmingfutures.org.uk/sites/default/files/casestudy/pdf/FF_FS23_Energy%20efficiency.pdf |accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmers are aware that consumers are increasingly asking for "green credentials". Gardeners who understand climate-friendly practices can advocate their use by farmers.&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt;

====From industry====
[[File:Elaeagnus umbellatus at the Agroforestry Research Trust forest garden.JPG|thumb|Nitrogen-fixing and edible - Elaeagnus umbellatus at the Agroforestry Research Trust forest garden in Devon]]
Climate-friendly gardeners aim to reduce their consumption in general.&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; In particular, they try to avoid or reduce their consumption of tapwater because of the greenhouse gases emitted when fossil fuels are burnt to supply the energy needed to treat and pump it to them.&lt;ref name="The Climate-Friendly Gardener"/&gt; Instead, gardeners can garden using only rainwater.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardening Without Water"/&gt;

Greenhouse gases are produced in the [[Manufacturing|manufacture]] of many materials and products used by [[gardener]]s. For example, it takes a lot of [[Energy industry|energy]] to produce [[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|synthetic fertilizer]]s, especially nitrogen fertilizers. [[Ammonium nitrate]], for example, has an [[embodied energy]] of 67000 kilojoules/kilogramme,&lt;ref name="Sustainable Gardens"/&gt; so [[Sustainable living|climate-friendly]] gardeners will choose alternative ways of ensuring the soil in their gardens has optimal levels of nitrogen by alternative means such as [[Nitrogen fixation#Root nodule symbioses|nitrogen-fixing plants]].

Climate-friendly gardeners will also aim to follow "[[cradle-to-cradle design]]" and "[[circular economy]]" principles: when they choose to buy or make something, it should be possible to take it apart again and [[Recycling|recycle]] or [[compost]] every part, so that there is no waste, only [[Natural resource|raw materials]] to be made into something else.&lt;ref name="Cradle to Cradle: Re-making the Way We Make Things"&gt;{{cite book |last=Braungart and McDonough |first=Michael and William |title=Cradle to Cradle: Re-making the Way We Make Things |date=2009 |publisher=Vintage, Random House |location=London |isbn=9780099535478}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This will reduce the greenhouse gases otherwise produced when [[Natural resource#Extraction|extracting]] raw materials.

====From transport====
Gardeners can reduce not only their [[food miles]] by growing some of their own food, but also their "gardening miles" by reducing the amount of plants and other materials they import, obtaining them as locally as possible and with as little packaging as possible. This might include ordering plants by [[mail order]] from a specialist nursery if the plants are sent out [[Bare root|bare-root]], reducing transport demand and the use of [[peat]]-based composts; or growing plants from [[seed]], which will also increase [[genetic diversity]] and therefore [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]]; or growing plants [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]] from [[Cutting (plant)|cutting]]s or [[Offset (botany)|offset]]s from other local gardeners; or buying reclaimed materials from salvage firms.&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt;

====From houses====
[[File:Parthenocissus tricuspidata, Boston ivy, in autumn colours.JPG|thumb|Climbers as insulation - Boston ivy, Parthenocissus tricuspidata, Boston ivy, in autumn]]
Climate-friendly gardeners can use their gardens in ways which reduce greenhouse gas emissions from homes by:

* Using sunlight and wind to dry washing on washing lines instead of fossil fuel-generated electricity to run [[Clothes dryer|tumble dryer]]s;
* Planting [[deciduous]] [[Vine|climber]]s on houses and planting deciduous trees at suitable distances from the house to provide shade during the summer, reducing the consumption of electricity for [[HVAC#Air conditioning|air conditioning]], but also such that at cooler times of year, sunlight can reach and warm a house, reducing [[HVAC#Heating|heating]] costs and consumption;&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;
* Planting hedges, trees, shrubs and climbers to shelter houses from wind, reducing heating costs and consumption during the winter (as long as any planting does not create a [[Wind tunnel|wind-tunnel]] effect).&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;243&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="The domestic garden – its contribution to urban green infrastructure"/&gt;

Climate-friendly gardeners may also choose to reduce their own personal greenhouse gas emissions by growing and eating [[carminative]] plants such as [[fennel]] and [[garlic]] which reduce intestinal gases such as methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Living Gut |date=2008 |publisher=Nottingham University Press |isbn=9781904761570 |first1=W. N. |last1=Ewing |first2=Lucy |last2=Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from gardens ===
[[File:Taxus baccata, yew, as internal hedge at Down House.JPG|thumb|Slow-growing yew, Taxus baccata, as hedge at Charles Darwin's home, Down House, Kent]]
[[File:Trifolium pratense and Trifolium repens, red and white clover within meadow.JPG|thumb|Nitrogen-fixing red and white clover (Trifolium) as lawn plants]]
[[File:Soil improvement - leaf cage, compost heap and wormery at Wisley.JPG|thumb|Leaf cage, compost heap and wormery at the Royal Horticultural Society garden at Wisley]]

There are some patent sources of greenhouse gas emissions in gardens and some more latent.

[[Power tool]]s which are powered by [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] or [[petrol]], or [[electricity]] [[Electricity generation|generated]] by burning other [[fossil fuel]]s, emit [[carbon dioxide]]. Climate-friendly gardeners may therefore choose to use [[Garden tool|hand tool]]s rather than power tools, or power tools powered by renewable electricity,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; or [[Garden design|design their gardens]] to reduce or remove a need to use power tools. For example, they may choose dense, slow-growing species for [[hedge]]s so that the hedges only need to be cut once a year.&lt;ref name="Ecological Gardening"/&gt;

Lawns need[?] to be cut by lawn mowers and, in drier parts of the world, are often irrigated by tapwater. Climate-friendly gardeners will therefore do what they can to reduce this consumption by:

* Replacing part of or all lawns with other perennial planting such as trees and shrubs with less ecologically demanding maintenance requirements;
* Cut some or all lawns only once or twice a year, i.e. convert them into [[meadow]]s;
* Make lawn shapes simple so that they may be cut quickly;
* Increase the cutting height of mower blades;

Greenhouses can be used to grow crops which might otherwise be imported from warmer climates, but if they are heated by fossil fuel then they may cause more greenhouse gas emissions than they save. Climate-friendly gardeners will therefore use their greenhouses carefully by:

* Choosing only annual plants which will only be in the greenhouse during warmer months, or perennial plants which do not need any extra heat during winter;
* Using water tanks as heat stores and compost heaps as heat sources inside greenhouses so that they stay frost-free in winter.

Climate-friendly gardeners will not put woody prunings on bonfires, which will emit carbon dioxide and black carbon,&lt;ref name="Ecology for Gardeners"/&gt; but instead burn them indoors in a [[wood-burning stove]] and therefore cut emissions from fossil fuel, or cut them up to use as [[mulch]] and increase soil carbon stores,&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; or add the smaller prunings to compost heaps to keep them [[Aeration|aerated]], reducing [[methane emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harriet Kopinska |author2=Jane Griffiths |author3=Heather Jackson |author4=Pauline Pears |title=The Garden Organic Book of Compost|date=2011|publisher=New Holland|location=London|isbn=9781847734372}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the risk of fire, they will also choose fire-resistant plants from habitats which are not prone to [[wildfire]]s and which do not catch fire easily, rather than fire-adapted [[Wildfire#Plant adaptation|plants from fire-prone habitats]] which are flammable and adapted to encourage fires and then gain a competitive advantage over less resistant species.

Climate-friendly gardeners may use deep-rooted plants such as [[comfrey]] to bring nutrients closer to the surface topsoil, but will do so without making the leaves into a liquid feed, because the rotting leaves in the [[Hypoxia (environmental)#Aquatic hypoxia|anaerobic]] conditions under water may emit methane.

[[Fertilizer#Inorganic commercial fertilizer|Nitrogen fertilizer]]s may be [[Nitrous oxide#Soil|oxidised]] to [[nitrous oxide]],&lt;ref name="How to Create an Eco Garden"/&gt; especially if fertilizer is applied in excess, or when plants are not actively growing. Climate-friendly gardeners may choose instead to use [[Nitrogen fixation#Root nodule symbioses|nitrogen-fixing]] plants which will add nitrogen to the soil without increasing nitrous oxide emissions.

'''Collective effervescence''' ('''CE''') is a sociological concept introduced by [[Émile Durkheim]]. According to Durkheim, a community or society may at times come together and simultaneously communicate the same thought and participate in the same action. Such an event then causes collective effervescence which excites individuals and serves to unify the group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/durkheim/&lt;/ref&gt;

== In religion ==
Collective effervescence is the basis for [[Émile Durkheim]]'s [[theories of religions|theory of religion]] as laid out in his 1912 volume ''[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life|Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]''. Durkheim argues that the universal religious [[dichotomy of profane and sacred]] results from the lives of these tribe members: most of their life is spent performing menial tasks such as hunting and gathering. These tasks are profane. The rare occasions on which the entire tribe gathers together become sacred, and the high energy level associated with these events gets directed onto physical objects or people which also become sacred.

The force is thus associated with the [[totem]] which is the symbol of the clan, mentioned by Durkheim in his study of "elementary forms" of religion in Aboriginal societies. Because it provides the tribe's name, the symbol is present during the gathering of the clan. Its presence during these scenes, the totem comes to represent both the scene and the strong emotional felt, thus becoming a collective representation of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Griswold, Wendy, ''Cultures and Societies in a Changing World'', Pine Forge Press, 2008; 51-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Durkheim, religion is a fundamentally social phenomenon. The beliefs and practices of the sacred are a method of [[social organization]]. This explanation is detailed in ''Elementary Forms'' "Book 2/The Elementary Beliefs", chapter 7, "Origins of These Beliefs: Origin of the Idea of the [[Totem]]ic Principle or [[Mana]]". According to Durkheim, "god and society are one of the same…the god of the clan…can be none other than the clan itself, but the clan transfigured and imagined in the physical form of a plant or animal that serves as a totem."&lt;ref name=Durkheim&gt;Durkheim 1995, p. 208 (1965, p. 236).&lt;/ref&gt;

The group members experience a feeling of a loss of individuality and unity with the gods and according to Durkheim, thus with the group.&lt;ref&gt;Kunin, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14763">In [[particle physics]], '''composite Higgs models''' (CHM) are speculative extensions of the [[Standard Model]] (SM) where the [[Higgs boson]] is a [[bound state]] of new strong interactions. These scenarios are the leading alternative to [[supersymmetric]] models for physics beyond the SM presently tested at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) in Geneva.

According to CHM the recently discovered [[Higgs boson]] is not an [[elementary particle]] (or point-like)  but has finite size, typically around 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; meters. This dimension is related to the [[electroweak scale|Fermi scale]] (100 GeV) that determines the strength of the [[weak interactions]] such as in [[β-decay]]. Microscopically the composite Higgs will be made of smaller constituents in the same way as nuclei are made [[protons]] and [[neutrons]].

The main prediction of CHM are new particles with mass around a [[TeV]] that are [[excited state|excitations]] of the composite Higgs. This is  analogous to the resonances in [[nuclear physics]]. The new particles could be produced and detected in collider experiments if the energy of the collision exceeds their mass and/or could produce deviations from the SM predictions in "low energy observables" — results of experiments at lower energies. Within the most compelling scenarios each Standard Model particle has a partner with equal quantum numbers but heavier mass. For example, the [[photon]], [[W and Z bosons]] have heavy replicas with mass determined by the compositeness scale, expected around 1 TeV.

CHM are motivated by the so-called naturalness or [[hierarchy problem]] of the SM,&lt;ref&gt;G. F. Giudice, ''Naturalness after LHC8'',   PoS EPS HEP2013, 163 (2013)   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.7879.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; the difficulty to explain the different energy scales that appear in the fundamental interactions of particle physics, in particular, the large difference between the mass of the Higgs boson and the [[Planck scale]]. CHM can solve the naturalness problem because the Higgs boson is not an elementary particle so that a new energy scale exists that can be explained dynamically similarly to the mass of the proton. Naturalness requires that new particles exist with mass around a TeV and these could be discovered at LHC or future experiments. As of 2018, no direct or indirect signs that the Higgs or other SM particles are composite has been detected.

== History ==
CHM were introduced in the early '80s as an extension of [[Technicolor (physics)|technicolor]] theories to allow for the presence of a physical Higgs boson. At the time this was not required by the data but recent discoveries have shown the necessity of a physical Higgs doublet to break the [[electroweak interaction|electro-weak symmetry]]. This differs from ordinary technicolor theories where strong dynamics directly breaks the electro-weak symmetry without the need of a physical Higgs boson. The first CHM proposed by Georgi and Kaplan were based on known [[gauge theory]] dynamics&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Dugan, H. Georgi and D. B.Kaplan, ''Anatomy of a Composite Higgs Model'',   Nucl.  Phys.  B254, 299 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; that produces the Higgs doublet as a [[Goldstone boson]]. These models are very constrained and it is difficult to include [[fermion]] masses. The subject remained dormant for several years until it was realized that this type of models naturally arise in 5 dimensional theories known as [[Randall–Sundrum]] scenarios. Within these constructions enough freedom exists to build realistic models at the price of abandoning a full microscopic description. It was soon understood that these scenarios can also be realized in hypothetical strongly coupled [[conformal field theory|conformal field theories]] (CFT) also providing a dynamical explanation for the generation of hierarchies. The connection between Randall-Sundrum models and CFTs is rooted in the [[AdS-CFT|AdS-CFT correspondence]]. This spurred a great deal of activity in the field. At first the Higgs was a generic scalar bound state. In the highly influential work&lt;ref&gt;K. Agashe, R. Contino and A. Pomarol, ''The Minimal composite Higgs model'',   Nucl. Phys. B719, 165 (2005)   https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0412089.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; the Higgs as a Goldstone boson was realized in Randall-Sundrum models and in CFTs. Detailed phenomenological studies showed that within this framework agreement with experimental data can be obtained with a mild [[fine-tuning|tuning]] of parameters.

== Models ==
CHM can be characterized by the mass (M) of the lightest new particles and their coupling (g). The latter is expected to be larger than the SM couplings for consistency. Various realizations of CHM exist that differ for the mechanism that generates the Higgs doublet. Broadly they can be divided in two categories:
# Higgs is a generic bound state of strong dynamics.
# Higgs is a Goldstone boson of spontaneous symmetry breaking&lt;ref&gt;R. Contino, ''The Higgs as a Composite Nambu-Goldstone Boson'',   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.4269.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Redi, https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxyZWRpNzZ8Z3g6YjZlZDk5NDU4NTBjMmU5&lt;/ref&gt;
In both cases the electro-weak symmetry is broken by the [[Bose-Einstein condensate|condensation]] of a Higgs scalar doublet. In the first type of scenario there is no a priori reason why the Higgs boson is lighter than the other composite states and moreover larger deviations from the SM are expected.

=== Higgs as Goldstone boson ===
In this scenario the existence of the Higgs boson follows from the symmetries of the theory. This allows to explain why this particle is lighter than the rest of the composite particles whose mass is expected from direct and indirect tests to be around a TeV or higher. It is assumed that the composite sector has a global symmetry G [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] to a subgroup H where G and H are compact [[Lie groups]]. Contrary to [[technicolor]] models the unbroken symmetry must contain the SM electro-weak group SU(2)xU(1).  According to [[Goldstone's theorem]] the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry produces massless scalar particles known as [[Goldstone bosons]]. By appropriately choosing the [[global symmetry|global symmetries]] it is possible to have Goldstone bosons that correspond to the Higgs doublet in the SM. This can be done in a variety of ways&lt;ref&gt;J. Mrazek, A. Pomarol, R. Rattazzi, M. Redi, J. Serra and A. Wulzer, ''The Other Natural Two Higgs Doublet Model'',   Nucl. Phys. B853, 1 (2011)   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.5403.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; and is completely determined by the symmetries. In particular [[group theory]] determines the [[quantum numbers]] of the Goldstone bosons. From the decomposition of the adjoint representation one finds,
:&lt;math&gt;\rm{Adj}[G]={\rm Adj}[H]+{\rm R}[\Pi]&lt;/math&gt;
where R[Π] is the representation of the Goldstone bosons under H. The phenomenological request that a Higgs doublet exists selects the possible symmetries. Typical example is the pattern
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {SO(5)}{SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R}\rightarrow GB=(2,2)&lt;/math&gt;
that contains a single Higgs doublet as a Goldstone boson.

The physics of the Higgs as a Goldstone boson is strongly constrained by the symmetries and determined by the symmetry breaking scale f that controls their interactions. An approximate relation exists between mass and coupling of the composite states,
&lt;math&gt;M=g f&lt;/math&gt;
In CHM one finds that deviations from the SM are proportional to,
:&lt;math&gt;\xi=\frac {v^2}{f^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where v=246 GeV is the [[electro-weak]] vacuum expectation value. By construction these models approximate the SM to arbitrary precision if  ξ is sufficiently small.  For example, for the model above with SO(5) global symmetry the coupling of the Higgs to W and Z bosons is modified as,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{h_{VV}}{h_{VV}^{SM}}\approx 1-\frac {\xi} 2 &lt;/math&gt;
Phenomenological studies suggest f &gt; 1 TeV and thus at least a factor of a few larger than v. However the tuning of parameters required to achieve v &lt; f is inversely proportional to ξ so that viable scenarios require some degree of tuning.

Goldstone bosons generated from the spontaneous breaking of an exact global symmetry are ''exactly'' massless. Therefore if the Higgs boson is a Goldstone boson the global symmetry cannot be exact. In CHM the Higgs potential is generated by effects that explicitly break the global symmetry G. Minimally these are the SM Yukawa and gauge couplings that cannot respect the global symmetry but other effects can also exist. The [[top quark|top]] coupling is expected to give a dominant contribution to the Higgs potential as this is the largest coupling in the SM. In the simplest models one finds a correlation between the Higgs mass and the mass M of the top partners,&lt;ref&gt;M. Redi and A. Tesi, ''Implications of a Light Higgs in Composite Models'',   JHEP 1210, 166 (2012)   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.0232.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m_h^2\sim \frac {3}{2\pi^2} \frac {M^2}{f^2} v^2&lt;/math&gt;
In models with f~TeV as suggested by naturalness this indicates fermionic resonances with mass around 1 TeV. Spin-1 resonances are expected to be somewhat heavier. This is within the reach of future collider experiments.

=== Partial compositeness ===
One of the key ingredients of modern realizations of CHM is the hypothesis of partial compositeness originally proposed by D. B. Kaplan.&lt;ref&gt;D. B. Kaplan, ''Flavor at SSC energies: A New mechanism for dynamically generated fermion masses'',   Nucl. Phys. B 365, 259 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is automatically realized in Randall-Sundrum scenarios. Every SM particle has a heavy partner that can mix with it. In practice the SM particles are linear combinations of elementary and composite states:
:&lt;math&gt;|SM\rangle=\cos{\alpha} |El&gt;+\sin{\alpha}|Co\rangle &lt;/math&gt;
where α denotes the mixing angle. Partial compositeness is naturally realized in the gauge sector where an analogous phenomenon happens [[quantum chromodynamics]] and is known as [[photon]]–[[rho meson|ρ]] mixing. For fermions it is an assumption that in particular requires the existence of heavy fermions with equal quantum numbers to SM [[quarks]] and [[leptons]]. These interact with the Higgs through the mixing. One schematically finds the formula for the SM fermion masses,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{m_f}v\approx \sin \alpha_L \cdot Y \cdot \sin \alpha_R &lt;/math&gt;
where L and R refer to the left and right mixings, and Y is a composite sector coupling.

The composite particles are multiplets of the unbroken symmetry H. For phenomenological reasons this should contain the custodial symmetry SU(2)xSU(2) extending the electro-weak symmetry SU(2)xU(1). Composite fermions often belong to [[representation of a Lie group|representations]] larger than the SM particles. For example, a strongly motivated representation for left-handed fermions is the (2,2) that contains particles with exotic electric charge 5/3 or –4/3 with special experimental signatures.

Partial compositeness ameliorates the phenomenology of CHM providing a logic why no deviations from the SM have been measured so far. In the so-called anarchic scenarios the hierarchies of SM fermion masses are generated through the hierarchies of mixings and anarchic composite sector couplings. The light fermions are almost elementary while the third generation is strongly or entirely composite. This leads to a structural suppression of all effects that involve first two generations that are the most precisely measured. In particular flavor transitions and corrections to electro-weak observables are suppressed. Other scenarios are also possible&lt;ref&gt;M. Redi and A. Weiler, ''Flavor and CP Invariant Composite Higgs Models'',   JHEP 1111, 108 (2011)   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.6357.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; with different phenomenology.

== Experiments ==
The main experimental signatures of CHM are:
# New heavy partners of Standard Model particles, with SM quantum numbers and masses around a TeV
# Modified SM couplings
# New contributions to [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] observables

Supersymmetric models also predict that every Standard Model particle will have a heavier partner. However, in supersymmetry the partners have a different [[spin (physics)|spin]]: they are bosons if the SM particle is a fermion, and ''vice versa''. In composite Higgs models the partners have the same spin as the SM particles.

All the deviations from the SM are controlled by the tuning parameter ξ. The mixing of the SM particles determines the coupling with the known particles of the SM. The detailed phenomenology depends strongly on the flavor assumptions and is in general model-dependent. The Higgs and the top quark typically have the largest coupling to the new particles. For this reason third [[generation (particle physics)|generation]] partners are the most easy to produce and top physics has the largest deviations from the SM. Top partners have also special importance given their role in the naturalness of the theory.

After the first run of the LHC direct experimental searches exclude third generation fermionic resonances up to 800 GeV.&lt;ref&gt;ATLAS, https://cds.cern.ch/record/1557777/files/ATLAS-CONF-2013-060.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CMS, https://cds.cern.ch/record/1524087/files/B2G-12-012-pas.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Bounds on gluon resonances are in the multi-TeV range&lt;ref&gt;ATLAS, https://cds.cern.ch/record/1547568/files/ATLAS-CONF-2013-052.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CMS, https://cds.cern.ch/record/1545285/files/B2G-12-005-pas.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and somewhat weaker bounds exist for electro-weak resonances.

Deviations from the SM couplings is proportional to the degree of compositeness of the particles. For this reason the largest departures from the SM predictions are expected for the third generation quarks and Higgs couplings.  The first have been measured with per mille precision by the [[LEP]] experiment. After the first run of the LHC the couplings of the Higgs with fermions and gauge bosons agree with the SM with a precision around 20%. These results pose some tension for CHM but are compatible with a compositeness scale f~TeV.

The hypothesis of partial compositeness allows to suppress [[Flavor-changing neutral current|flavor violation]] beyond the SM that is severely constrained experimentally. Nevertheless, within anarchic scenarios sizable deviations from the SM predictions exist in several observables. Particularly constrained is [[CP violation]] in the [[Kaon]] system and lepton flavor violation for example the rare decay μ-&gt;eγ. Overall flavor physics suggests the strongest indirect bounds on anarchic scenarios. This tension can be avoided with different flavor assumptions.

'''Conflict continuum''' is a model or concept used by various [[Social sciences|social science]] researchers in modelling conflict, usually going from low "irritations" to high "explosiveness" intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.uiowa.edu/pimgr/?get=conflict |title=Conflict Management |accessdate=2010-11-30 |date=26 July 2007 |publisher=The University of Iowa |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002222238/https://research.uiowa.edu/pimgr/?get=conflict |archivedate=2 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These conceptual models facilitate discussion as in "anywhere on the conflict continuum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ruoti | first1 = Tony | title = C412 INTEROPERABILITY: Operational Art in a New Paradigm | publisher = NAVAL WAR COLLEGE | date = 18 June 1993 | location = Newport, RI. | pages = ii | url = http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA266739 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hart | first1 = Louis B. | title = Learning from Conflict: A Handbook for Trainers and Group Leaders | chapter = 4.

==Various continuum models==

=== Elise Boulding's conflict continuum===
[[Elise M. Boulding]] was a Quaker sociologist influenced by the events of World War II. Examining how war becomes peace, she posited a continuum between Wars of Extermination &lt;ref name="HockerW"&gt;{{cite book | author = Hocker, Joyce &amp; William W. Wilmot | title = Interpersonal Conflict, 4th Edition | year = 1995 | publisher = Brown &amp; Benchmark, Madison }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Transformation.&lt;ref name="GLorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global-leader.org/gl_history_gmrs.htm |title=History |year=2001 |publisher=The Institute for Global Leadership |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uxd3ekHA?url=http://www.global-leader.org/gl_history_gmrs.htm |archivedate=14 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is Boulding’s conflict continuum:&lt;ref name="HockerW" /&gt;  War of extermination, Limited war, Threat systems (deterrence), Arbitration, Mediation, Negotiation (exchange), Mutual adaptation, Alliance, Co-operation, Integration,&lt;ref name="HockerW" /&gt; Transformation.&lt;ref name="GLorg" /&gt;

===Andra Medea===
{{COI|section|date=March 2013}}
{{primary sources|section|date=March 2013}}
Theorist [[Andra Medea]] seeks to explain how [[individuals]], small groups, [[organizations]], [[family|families]], [[ethnicities]], and even whole [[nations]] function when disputes arise between them. She posits that there are four types or levels of conflict, each operating under distinct rules: 1) ''Problem Solving''; 2) ''Domination''; 3) ''Blind Behavior''; 4) ''Rogue Messiah''.&lt;ref&gt;Andra Medea interviewed by McDonnell, Jerome. [http://www.wbez.org/episode-segments/may-6-1999 "WorldView"]. WBEZ, Chicago. 16 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level moving from first to fourth is characterized by increasing degrees of separation from reality, and decreasing degrees of maturity, in this context, defined as the ability to control anger and settle differences without violence or destruction. Problem-solving behavior is based in reality and maturity, and is therefore more rational and mature than domination. Domination is more rational and mature than blind behavior, which is more rational and mature than the Rogue Messiah.&lt;ref name="AMbookA"&gt;Medea, Andra. “The Conflict Continuum.”  Chicago, 1996. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, each level moving from fourth to first is more capable than the one below it at forcing victory in a conflict. The Rogue Messiah overpowers blind behavior, blind behavior thwarts domination, and domination deadlocks Problem-solving.&lt;ref name="AMbookA" /&gt;

The report stated the following about Totalitarian machines:

{{Quotation|Let us mention briefly [[Fascism]], National Socialism and [[Titoism]] in [[Italy]], [[Austria]] and Slovenia. Three Christian nations, with nationalist tendencies, were infected with totalitarianism. The descent into barbarism has comparable structural elements: 
*Abuse of national sentiment to carry out racial and class revolutionary projects;
*Cult of a great leader,&lt;ref&gt;Discontents: Post-modern and Post communist' by [[Paul Hollander]]:
*Virtually every communist system extinct or surviving at one point or another had a supreme leader who was both extraordinarily powerful and surrounded by a bizarre cult, indeed worship. In the past (or in a more traditional contemporary societies) such as cults were reserved for deities and associated with conventional religious behaviour and institutions. These cults although apparently an intrinsic part of communist dictatorships (at any rate at a stage in their evolution) are largely forgotten today." " Stalin, Mao, Castro, Ho Chi Minh, Kim Sung, Enver Hoxha, Ceascesu, Dimitrov, Ulbricht, Gottwald, Josip Broz Tito and others all were the object of such cults. The prototypical cult was that of Stalin which was duplicated elsewhere with minor variations. Paul Hollander Ph.D in Sociology.

*Dictatorship of one party;
*[[Militarisation]] of society, police state – almighty secret political police;
*Collectivism, subjection of the citizen to the totalitarian state;
*State terrorism with systematic abuses of basic [[human rights]];
*Aggressive assumption of power and struggle for territory.

A '''favorite son''' (or a '''favorite daughter''') is a [[politics|political]] term.

* At the quadrennial American national political party conventions, a state delegation sometimes nominates and votes for a candidate from the state, or less often from the state's region, who is not a viable candidate. The technique allows state leaders to negotiate with leading candidates in exchange for the delegation's support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19280112&amp;id=HMsaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4ksEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1498,440704&amp;hl=en |title=How 'Favorite Son' Politics Works |date=January 12, 1928 |newspaper=[[The Pittsburgh Press]] |via=Google News Archive Search }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19600130&amp;id=v91LAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zooDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7345,1724319&amp;hl=en|title=How Term 'Favorite Son' Got Started in Politics |date=January 30, 1960 |via=Google News Archive Search |newspaper=The Free Lance-Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since nationwide campaigns by candidates and binding [[primary election]]s have replaced [[brokered convention]]s, the technique has fallen out of use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19710920&amp;id=vbVSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fH8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7269,4614679&amp;hl=en|title=No Demo Favorite Sons |date=September 20, 1971 |via=Google News Archive Search|newspaper=[[The Deseret News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Byron E. |last=Shafer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAQ_cWsAW-cC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=%22Favorite+son%22+politics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ4cSE0cbJAhXuooMKHVHqAJ04ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Favorite%20son%22%20politics&amp;f=false|title=Bifurcated Politics: Evolution and Reform in the National Party Convention|publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn= 9780674072565 |date=1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as party rule changes in the early 1970s required candidates to have nominations from more than one state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Y7NCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;ots=XpAFPNdiQd&amp;dq=%22favorite+son%22+candidacies&amp;pg=PA202#v=onepage&amp;q=%22favorite+son%22+candidacies&amp;f=false|title=Elections A to Z|first1=Dave|last1=Tarr|first2=Bob|last2=Benenson|date=22 October 2013|publisher=CQ Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soul of the primordial bovine &amp;ndash; ''geush urvan'' &amp;ndash; returned to the world as the soul of livestock. Although ''geush urvan'' is an aspect of the primordial bovine in Zoroastrian tradition, and may also be that in the Younger Avesta, the relationship between the two is unclear in the oldest texts.

==In scripture==
Although Avestan ''gav-'' "cow" is grammatically feminine, the word is also used as a singular for the collective "cattle". In English language translations Gavaevodata is often referred to in gender-neutral terms as "primordial ox". Other translations refer to Gavaevodata as a [[bull]] (''cf.'' {{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=139}}). The ''-aevo.data'' of the name literally means "created as one" or "solely created" or "uniquely created".

Gavaevodata is only alluded to in the surviving texts of the [[Avesta]], referred to by name in only two hymns. In other instances, for example in ''Yasht''&amp;nbsp;13.85, the primordial beast is mentioned among the six&lt;!-- see  footnote --&gt; material creations, but not by name. Elsewhere, such as in the Gathic Avestan ''[[Yasna Haptanghaiti]]'', prayers are offered on behalf of the soul of the cow (''geush urvan'', ''Y.''&amp;nbsp;35), or worship is offered to "the cow's soul, and to her created body" (''Y''.&amp;nbsp;39), but in neither case is Gavaevodata mentioned by name, nor is it clear (unlike in Zoroastrian tradition) whether the soul of the cow is the soul of Gavaevodata.

This is also the case for ''The Cow's Lament'' in ''Yasna''&amp;nbsp;29, which – as a ''Gatha'' – is attributed to Zoroaster himself, and is thus the subject of a great deal of interpretation. In this allegorical text, the soul of the cow (''geush urvan'') despairs over the wretched condition to which the forces of deceit (''[[druj]]'') have subjected her (see myth, [[#In tradition|below]]), and over her lack of protection from an adequate herdsman. The divinities hold council, and decide that Zoroaster is the only one who can alleviate her condition. At first she laments even more, holding Zoroaster to be incompetent, but finally accepts his assistance.

At least two levels of meaning have been inferred from this text ({{harvnb|Malandra|2001|p=577}}): The maltreated creature symbolizes the plight of Zoroaster's community, and the soul of the primordial beast is a metaphor for the message that Zoroaster has received from Mazda. In verse&amp;nbsp;3 of the litany to the moon (''Mah Niyayesh''&amp;nbsp;3), Gavaevodata is invoked as (or together with) the "bovine of many species" in the care of the moon [[Mah]], specifically ''måŋha- gaociθra-'' "the moon that keeps in it the ''cithra''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="cithra" /&gt; of cattle," which is a stock epithet of ''Mah'' (''Yasht''&amp;nbsp;7.3, 7.5, 7.6, ''GBd''&amp;nbsp;VIe.2-3, VII.5-6 etc.)

In the 30&amp;nbsp;hymns to the divinities of the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] month, Gavaevodata is again invoked in the verses nominally dedicated to the &lt;!-- caps --&gt;Moon. In both ''Siroza''&amp;nbsp;1.12 and 2.12, Mah is again referred to as "the &lt;!-- caps --&gt;Moon containing the ''cithra'' of cattle," and Gavaevodata is again referred to as (or in the company of) the "Bovine of many species."

==In tradition==
The mythology of the "uniquely created bovine" that is only alluded to in the extant Avesta appears fully developed in the 9th-11th century Middle Persian texts of Zoroastrian tradition. In these texts, Avestan Gavaevodata appears as [[Middle Persian]] ''gaw i ew-dad'' or ''ewazdad'' or ''ewagdad,'' and retains the same literal meaning as the Avestan language form.

As also for all other Zoroastrian cosmological beliefs, the primary source of information on the primordial ox is the ''[[Bundahishn]]'', a 9th-century text.  In this text, the primordial ox is a [[hermaphrodite]], having both milk (''Ibd''&amp;nbsp;43.15) and semen (''Ibd''&amp;nbsp;94.4). It is "white, bright like the moon, and three measured poles in height" (''Gbd''&amp;nbsp;Ia.12). The uniquely created ox lived its life on the river Veh. Daiti (''Gbd''&amp;nbsp;Ia.12), and on the opposite bank lived Gayomart/d (Avestan ''Gayo maretan''), the mythical first human.

Gawi ewdad's role in the creation myth runs as follows: During the first three-thousand year period, [[Ahura Mazda]]'s (''Ormuzd'') fashioned the bovine as His fourth or fifth&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The primordial bovine is either the fifth or the fourth creation, depending on which enumeration is followed. The number of material creations varies as well, and is either six or seven, subject to whether fire is included as the seventh and last of the material creations. The Greater ''Bundahishn'' has Gawi ewdad as the fifth of seven creations.&lt;/ref&gt; of six&lt;!-- see footnote --&gt; primordial material creations. At the beginning of the second three-thousand year period, [[Angra Mainyu]] (''Ahriman'') attacked the world, and the Creator responded by placing the primordial plant, bovine, and human in the respective heavenly spheres of the stars, moon and sun (''IBd''&amp;nbsp;7). But Ahriman assaulted the sky and Ormuzd fed the bovine "medicinal ''mang''" (''mang bēšaz''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Middle Persian ''mang'' refers to either henbane (e.g. ''[[Hyoscyamus niger]]'') or datura (''[[Datura stramonium]]'') or hemp (e.g. ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'').&lt;!-- i.e. not hashish, which is what NP bang refers to--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) to lessen its suffering (''GBd''&amp;nbsp;IV.20). The bull immediately became feeble, and then died.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite book |author=Henning |title=Zoroaster: Politician or witch doctor? |page=32}} suggests that the author meant a euthanasiac was administered. For contra, see {{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=231, n. 11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

But as it lay dying its ''chihr''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="cithra" /&gt; was rescued and carried to "the moon station."&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The "moon station" being referred to is the station of the moon known in Middle Persian as  ''pesh Parwez'' "before (in front of) Parwez," with Parwez being the Middle Persian equivalent of Avestan ''paoiryaeinyas'', the [[Pleiades]].&lt;!-- An allusion in  ''Dadestan-i Denig''&amp;nbsp;37.46 suggests that (the nebulae of) the Pleiades were once mythologically identified as the ''chihr'' of the primordial bovine. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the care of the moon, the ''chihr''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="cithra" /&gt; of the beast was purified and became the male and female pairs of the animals "of many species." After the ox's death, fifty-five kinds of grain and twelve kinds of medicinal plants grew from its marrow (''Ibd'' 10). In another passage  (''Ibd'' 93.11, ''cf'' an equivalent passage in  ''Zadspram''), the ''Bundahishn'' speaks of sesame, lentils, leeks, grapes, mustard and marjoram issuing from various other parts of its body. For example, lentils from the liver and mustard from the lungs&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;For the reconstruction of the Avestan word for mustard (identified in Zoroastrian tradition with healthy lungs), and its homophonic similarity to the Middle Persian word for lungs, see {{citation |last=Henning |first=Walter Bruno |title=A grain of mustard |journal=Annali dell' Istituto Orientale di Napoli |series=Sezione Linguistica |volume=6 |year=1965 |pages=29–31}} (''Selected Papers&amp;nbsp;II'', pp.&amp;nbsp;597-599).&lt;/ref&gt; (''Ibd'' 14.1, ''Gbd'' XIII.2&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In several translations (e.g. the Anklesaria or West ''Bundahishn''s) of Middle Persian texts, Middle Persian ''sipandan'' "mustard" is mis-translated as "(wild) rue." This is due to a confusion of mustard (Middle Persian ''sipandan'') with ''[[harmal|s(i)pand]]'', which is so-called &lt;!-- not rue at all --&gt;"Syrian rue."&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Goshorun (from Avestan ''[[geush urvan]]''), the soul of the primordial bovine, escaped to the star, moon, and sun stations where she lamented the destruction of the world. She was not placated until Ormuzd shows her the ''[[fravashi]]'' of the yet-unborn [[Zoroaster]] (whose  protection she would receive). Contented with the promise of protection, Goshorun then agreed to be "created back to the world in livestock." (''Gbd''&amp;nbsp;IVa.2ff,  ''Ibd'''&amp;nbsp;46.3ff., ''[[Denkard]]''&amp;nbsp;p.9).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3508">In [[esoteric]] and [[occult]] teachings, '''giants''' are beings who live on [[spiritual (spiritual plane)|spiritual]], [[etheric (etheric plane)|etheric]] and [[physical (physical plane)|physical]] [[planes of existence]]. Giants were a popular theme in [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|theosophical]] [[literature]], [[Atlantis]], [[lost continents]] and later the [[earth mysteries]] movement of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} 

==History==
The concept of giants was discussed by the [[theosophist]] and [[occult]] author [[Blavatsky]] who wrote about the existence of giants in her book ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' connecting them to her theory of [[root races]] and claiming they correspond with [[Hindu cycle of the universe]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}  According to theosophists, ape-like giants were the third [[root race]] who lived on the continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gardner, Fads and fallacies in the name of science, 1957, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophists also linked giants to the Atlantean race.

The [[Germans|German]] [[occultist]] [[Guido von List]] was influenced by Blavatsky's writings on giants and mixed together [[paganism]], [[mythology]], and theosophy, creating a basis for the belief in giants living in different realms based on the first four rounds of the root race theory.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology, 1993, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz]], an [[Egyptologist]] and [[tradition]]alist, believed that giants had roamed the [[earth]], and that after the fall of [[Adam]], humanity fell into a state of degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman, Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen, 2008, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lewis Spence]], a writer on mythology, was critical of theosophy but accepted the existence of giants. He researched [[English folklore]] and mythology depicting such giants such as [[Gog and Magog|Magog]] and the British giant [[Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Spence, 1976, The Occult Sciences in Atlantis, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer who was opposed to occultism was the British [[journalist]] and author [[William Comyns Beaumont]]. Like Spence, he accepted the existence of giants based on folklore, mythology, and [[archeology]]. Beaumont believed that [[United Kingdom|Britain]] was the location of [[Atlantis]] and that it was occupied by a giant race of [[Aryan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IZNKVA1JcWwC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=comyns+beaumont+giants&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rlr3TcGTBpOctwejoeS_Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEUQuwUwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Karl Shaw, Curing Hiccups with Small Fires: A Delightful Miscellany of Great British Eccentrics]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s many of the authors of the [[earth mysteries]] movement in Britain wrote about Giants. [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]] wrote about the existence of giants in his book ''The View over Atlantis''. Anthony Roberts wrote the book ''Sowers of Thunder: Giants in Myth and History'' in 1978, in which he claimed that giants were the original inhabitants of the  [[British Isles]] and linked [[Alfred Watkins]]' [[ley lines]] to the British giants.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chippindale, Stonehenge complete, Cornell University Press, 1983, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grothendieck's relative point of view''' is a [[heuristic]] applied in certain abstract [[mathematical]] situations, with a rough meaning of taking for consideration families of 'objects' explicitly depending on [[parameter]]s, as the basic field of study, rather than a single such object. It is named after [[Alexander Grothendieck]], who made extensive use of it in treating foundational aspects of [[algebraic geometry]]. Outside that field, it has been influential particularly on [[category theory]] and [[categorical logic]].

In the usual formulation, the language of category theory is applied, to describe the point of view as treating, not [[object (category theory)|objects]] ''X''  of a given category ''C'' as such, but [[morphism]]s

:''f'': ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''S''

where ''S'' is a fixed object. This idea is made formal in the idea of the [[slice category]] of objects of ''C'' 'above' S. To move from one slice to another requires a '''base change'''; from a technical point of view base change becomes a major issue for the whole approach (see for example [[Beck–Chevalley conditions]]).

A base change 'along' a given morphism

:''g'': ''T'' &amp;rarr; ''S''

is typically given by the [[fiber product]], producing an object over ''T'' from one over ''S''. The 'fiber' terminology is significant: the underlying heuristic is that ''X'' over ''S'' is a family of fibers, one for each 'point' of ''S''; the fiber product is then the family on ''T'', which described by fibers is for each point of ''T'' the fiber at its image in ''S''. This set-theoretic language is too naïve to fit the required context, certainly, from algebraic geometry. It combines, though, with the use of the [[Yoneda lemma]] to replace the 'point' idea with that of treating an object, such as ''S'', as 'as good as' the [[representable functor]] it sets up.

The [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]] from about 1956 is usually cited as the key moment for the introduction of this circle of ideas. The more classical types of [[Riemann–Roch theorem]] are recovered in the case where ''S'' is a single point (i.e. the [[final object]] in the working category ''C'').  Using other ''S'' is a way to have versions of theorems 'with parameters', i.e. allowing for continuous variation, for which the 'frozen' version reduces the parameters to [[Coefficient|constants]].

In other applications, this way of thinking has been used in [[topos theory]], to clarify the role of [[set theory]] in foundational matters. Assuming that we don’t have a commitment to one 'set theory' (all toposes are in some sense equally set theories for some [[intuitionistic logic]]) it is possible to state everything relative to some given set theory that acts as a base topos.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24401">Created on July 8, 1992 by the Helsinki Summit Meeting of the [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (CSCE), now known as the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), the '''High Commissioner on National Minorities''' (HCNM) is charged with identifying and seeking early resolution of ethnic tension that might endanger peace, stability or friendly relations between and within the participating states of the OSCE. The HCNM focuses on the OSCE area and will alert the Organisation where a situation has the potential to develop into a conflict.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Mandate, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/107878. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The Organisation consists of 57 participating States across North America, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE Participating States, at http://www.osce.org/states. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the HCNM is generally considered to be a “success story”&lt;ref&gt;Ghebali, V-Y. (2009) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities after 15 Years: Achievements, Challenges and Promises''. Security and Human Rights: 20(2), 111 at 111&lt;/ref&gt; and a useful instrument of conflict prevention.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The creation of the office of HCNM was directly related to the political circumstances at the beginning of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 15&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yugoslav Wars]] were ethnic conflicts that broke out after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and of Communism, and which eventually resulted in the break up of the country. Efforts of the CSCE, [[European Union]] and [[United Nations]] failed to bring peace. The frustration at being unable to prevent such a devastating human tragedy led to the Netherlands government proposing the post of the HCNM.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 16&lt;/ref&gt; This office would aim to prevent conflicts based on tensions with ethnic minorities. In regards to the Yugoslav tragedy, international efforts were deemed to have failed because of the limited knowledge of the international mediators of the ethnic situation.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 17&lt;/ref&gt; This often meant that tensions escalated because the international community did not fully understand the issues at play. Further, any international aid that was provided came too late. It was recognised that such tensions should be identified and addressed as early as possible in order to prevent escalation into endless conflict. The Yugoslav conflict also made clear that many conflicts around the world were rooted in tensions involving national minorities. It was against this background that the proposal for the office of the HCNM was presented.

===Opposition to the proposal===

Many concerns were raised in regards to the model put forward by the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 17&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, several major restrictions to the HCNM’s role were implemented into the mandate.

States disagreed on whether the rights of national minorities were individual or group rights. Ultimately, there was a clear exclusion of individual cases through paragraph 5(c) of the HCNM mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 5(c), at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; This prohibits the High Commissioner from considering “violations of CSCE commitments with regard to an individual person belonging to a national minority”. Many states feared that the HCNM would become a sort of "[[ombudsman]]" for national minorities. The aim of the office was not to create a new human rights instrument, but to create a conflict prevention tool.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 18&lt;/ref&gt; This was emphasised in the title of the office: the High Commissioner ''on'' National Minorities, not ''for'' National Minorities.

Many states were also highly opposed to involvement by the HCNM in cases of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 19&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the HCNM was prohibited from considering ‘national minority issues in situations involving organized acts of terrorism’.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 5(b), at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; The international community further decided that the HCNM should not be able to ‘communicate with and (...) acknowledge communications from any person or organization which practices or publicly condones terrorism or violence’.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 25, at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances this clause has become a way for states to ban the HCNM from interfering with their minority problems.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambiguity in the mandate===
The HCNM’s mandate as defined at the Helsinki Summit meeting in 1992 contained many ambiguities, the most significant of which is the definition of “national minorities”. No clear guidance was given in the mandate on how to interpret this term. This was largely because  the CSCE participating states could not come to an agreement on the definition of "national minorities", and therefore opted to provide no definition at all.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The first High Commissioner, [[Max van der Stoel]], focused on clarifying and defining his mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 21&lt;/ref&gt; He did this by consulting many experts on minority rights and international law, and thereby developing a set of guidelines and practices for overcoming the ambiguities in the mandate. Through the broadly defined mandate, he was able to approach the role in the best way he saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 22&lt;/ref&gt; The approach taken by van der Stoel came to define how his successors approached the role too. His definition of “national minorities” had three different elements.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''.  Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 29&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, a national minority could be distinguished from the rest of society through linguistic, ethnic or cultural characteristics. Secondly, that minority strived to protect and strengthen those characteristics which made up its identity. Finally, he referenced paragraph 32 of the 1990 CSCE Copenhagen Document,&lt;ref&gt;Confoerence for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE’ 1990, paragraph 32, at http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/14304?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasised that being a part of a national minority was a person’s individual choice.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''.  Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 29&lt;/ref&gt; In the approach taken by van der Stoel and his successors, there is no requirement that a national minority be a numerical minority in the population.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''.  Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 29&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases a national minority will be a majority in certain countries or regions.

The main role of the HCNM is to identify and address tensions involving national minorities which could develop into a conflict.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This involves “early warning” of potential conflict followed by “early action” to dissolve tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 3, at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; The mandate authorises the HCNM to assess ‘the role of the parties directly concerned, the nature of the tensions and recent developments therein and, where possible, the potential consequences for peace and stability within the OSCE area’.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 11(b), at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt; Her most important role is not necessarily to completely resolve all potential conflicts, but rather to manage them in a way that the tension between groups does not escalate but declines.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''.  Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 17&lt;/ref&gt; This involves mediation as well as the introduction of sustainable solutions.

Ultimately, the role of the High Commissioner is one of preventative diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 26&lt;/ref&gt; She must provide early warnings of escalating tensions as well as early action to prevent any further escalation. Tensions between different societal groups can arise over a variety of elements, such as ethnicity, religion, or language.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Conflict prevention and resolution, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/117648. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The HCNM works to sort through these tensions and towards social cohesion, before those tensions escalate into conflicts. The first HCNM, Max van der Stoel, noted that the HCNM should aim to prevent disputes from arising into armed conflicts, but should also understand that in some cases the situation may go beyond the realm of preventative diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 27&lt;/ref&gt; Where conflicts can only be resolved in the long term, a more comprehensive approach must be taken. This may result in the High Commissioner issuing an early warning notice to the Permanent Council, alongside a request for the OSCE to issue her an ‘ad hoc’ mandate for late prevention of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Ghebali, V-Y. (2009) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities after 15 Years: Achievements, Challenges and Promises''. Security and Human Rights: 20(2), 111 at 113 CHECK&lt;/ref&gt; An early warning notice under paragraph 15 of the mandate has only been issued once before, in regards to the 1999 Kosovo crisis.&lt;ref&gt;CHECK Ghebali, V-Y. (2009) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities after 15 Years: Achievements, Challenges and Promises''. Security and Human Rights: 20(2), 111 at 115&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to promote social cohesion, the HCNM must provide advice and take actions that are context specific. Significant research should be undertaken about the specific society and ethnic groups involved in order to effectively respond to the situation. Van der Stoel always prepared extensively for any state involvement, often by organising a one- or two-day workshop with leading experts in several relevant areas.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15  at 21&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of this approach arose due to the failures of the international community during the Yugoslav Wars, where a lack of understanding about the ethnic situation by international mediators often led to a worsening of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Bloed, A. (2013) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities: Origins and Background''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 15 at 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The work undertaken by the High Commissioners since the inception of the role is considered to have been largely successful.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, S. (2013) ''Twenty Years On and Twenty Years Ahead: The Continuing Relevance of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 63 at 75&lt;/ref&gt; The role requires expertise, tools and experience in monitoring situations of potential tension, as well as in recognising signs of escalation.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, S. (2013) ''Twenty Years On and Twenty Years Ahead: The Continuing Relevance of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 63 at 64&lt;/ref&gt; Such knowledge and skill is invaluable in regards to conflict prevention involving minorities, because these situations are often very precarious and complex. No inter-ethnic tension is alike, and each will involve different factors and historical and cultural influences. There is therefore a clear need for a dedicated office specialised in and focused on minority issues.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, S. (2013) ''Twenty Years On and Twenty Years Ahead: The Continuing Relevance of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 63 at 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods used in conflict prevention===

The HCNM employs several different techniques in order to achieve her purpose of conflict prevention.  The High Commissioner works very closely with the particular state involved and with the leaders of the relevant parties. While the HCNM ultimately cannot enforce any compulsory action, there are many ways that the HCNM can assist the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Zellner, W. (2013) ''Working without Sanctions: Factors Contributing to the (Relative) Effectiveness of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 25 at 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Commissioner will assist in preventing an escalating conflict by introducing a minimum standard of minority rights, which should be upheld by the state and other majority actors. She may also assist in implementing those standards and helping them become the norm in that state. There are seven sets of thematic recommendations that can provide a platform for better inter-ethnic relations and help to reduce tension. These include recommendations on education, linguistic rights, participation, kin-states, policing in multi-ethnic societies, minority languages in broadcast media, and integration and conflict prevention.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, S. (2013) ''Twenty Years On and Twenty Years Ahead: The Continuing Relevance of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 63 at 65&lt;/ref&gt; The HCNM frequently recommends that states take measures to protect minority languages, as this is one of the major causes of inter-ethnic tension.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Minority and majority languages, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/107883. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; However, the OSCE and HCNM also promote a policy of integration, which strives for a balance between protection of minority culture and the development of an overarching common identity. This involves integration policies such as encouragement to learn the state language.&lt;ref&gt;Zanker, F. (2010) ''Integration as Conflict Prevention: Possibilities and Limitations in the experience of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Security and Human Rights, 21(3) 220 at 221&lt;/ref&gt; The High Commissioner also promotes education of national minority languages and religious practices as a way to prevent conflict.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Education and conflict prevention, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/107882. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This is a way to foster an appreciation of diversity among communities and also to dissolve stereotypes about certain ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Education and conflict prevention, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/107882. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The HCNM will also focus on improving communication between the parties involved, including leaders of the state and leaders of the opposing national groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ghebali, V-Y. (2009) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities after 15 Years: Achievements, Challenges and Promises''. Security and Human Rights: 20(2), 111 at 113&lt;/ref&gt; This involves assisting processes of negotiations and ensuring participation by all relevant parties. When creating the role, it was recognised that the most frequent cause of hostile inter-ethnic relations was insufficient or distorted communication.&lt;ref&gt;Ghebali, V-Y. (2009) ''The High Commissioner on National Minorities after 15 Years: Achievements, Challenges and Promises''. Security and Human Rights: 20(2), 111 at 115&lt;/ref&gt; The HCNM plays an important role in setting up lines of effective communication before hostile relations begin to develop.

In order to develop a peaceful society the High Commissioner strives to ensure that all minority groups are sufficiently involved in public life, and are fairly represented at national, regional and local levels.&lt;ref&gt;OSCE HCNM Promoting effective participation in public life, at http://www.osce.org/hcnm/107884. Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; By ensuring that minority groups are involved in decision-making processes and that they enjoy some level of influence, states can prevent these groups from becoming marginalised. Active and effective participation also provides remedies for groups who feel their rights are being violated, and in doing so can prevent such groups from seeking remedies in a more violent manner.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, S. (2013) ''Twenty Years On and Twenty Years Ahead: The Continuing Relevance of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities''. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe: 12(3), 63 at 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, all governments may exercise a right of refusal against participation of the High Commissioner, and may prevent her from entering the country. In such a circumstance, the HCNM is to inform the OSCE.&lt;ref&gt;Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ‘CSCE Helsinki Document 1992: The Challenges of Change’. Part II, paragraph 28, at http://www.osce.org/mc/39530?download=true&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in Ukraine==

The first HCNM, Max van der Stoel, was involved with inter-ethnic tensions in [[Ukraine]] between a substantial Russian minority and the Ukraine government from 1994 to 2001. His work during this time was considered largely successful in reducing tensions and building towards peaceful solutions. This conflict was multi layered and emphasised the importance of finding durable solutions in the search for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 389&lt;/ref&gt; Following the disintegration of the [[USSR]] and [[Ukrainian independence]] in 1991, tensions began to arise as Ukraine sought to establish its identity.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 391&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, these uneasy relations were caused by historical Russian domination over Ukraine, as well as the prevalence of Russian language in Ukrainian life. While the HCNM was not the only influential actor in managing and resolving these issues, he played a critical role in establishing movement towards peace.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 393&lt;/ref&gt;

The flexibility of the HCNM’s mandate and the nature of the role allowed van der Stoel to become involved in the tensions in Ukraine at a very early stage. He was able to craft a tactful and creative approach to dealing with the precarious issues that had arisen at that stage.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 392&lt;/ref&gt; The success of his work there is in large part credited to his ability to build a relationship of trust with the parties involved and to approach all issues from the basis of impartiality.

The HCNM was invited to Ukraine by the government in February 1994. In Ukraine at that time there were several minority issues that were causing tension. The HCNM  was involved in managing the relations between the Russian minority and the Ukrainian majority, the status of [[Crimea]] within Ukraine, and resettlement of the [[Crimean Tatars]].&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 393&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, descent into violent conflict was prevented in all areas. However, while the HCNM’s work was largely successful, it also exposed the limitations of the role. The Ukrainian government was unwilling to implement the majority of his recommendations, even though it was consistently willing to engage with the HCNM.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 393&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, while the HCNM ultimately played a critical role in conflict prevention in Ukraine, his ability to secure a sustainable solution across all areas of tension was often limited.&lt;ref&gt;Kachuyevski, A. (2012) ''The Possibilities and Limitations of Preventive Action: The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in Ukraine''. International Negotiation: 17(3) 389 at 394&lt;/ref&gt;

In the psychology of [[affective forecasting]], the '''impact bias''', a form of which is the '''durability bias''', is the tendency for people to overestimate the length or the intensity of future emotional states.

== Example ==

In Gilbert et al., 1998, there was a conducted study on individuals participating in a [[job interview]].  The participants were separated into two groups; the ''unfair decision condition'' (where the decision of being hired was left up to a single MBA student with sole authority listening to the interview) and the ''fair decision condition'' (where the decision was made by a team of MBA students who had to independently and unanimously decide the fate of the interviewee). Then, certain participants were chosen to forecast how they would feel if they were chosen or not chosen for the job immediately after learning if they had been hired or fired and then they had to predict how they would feel ten minutes after hearing the news. Then following the interview, all participants were given letters notifying them they had not been selected for the job.  All participants were then required to fill out a questionnaire that reported their current happiness.  Then after waiting ten minutes, the experimenter presented all the participants with another questionnaire that once again asked them to report their current level of happiness.
The predictions made by the participants in both the unfair and fair groups were about the same regarding how they would feel immediately after hearing the news as well as ten minutes later.  Both groups accurately predicted how they would feel immediately after hearing the news.  The study showed that both groups felt much better than they had originally predicted, ten minutes later, demonstrating the impact bias.&lt;ref name="Gilbert1998"/&gt;

== Causes ==

Explanations for the occurrence of the impact bias include the following:&lt;ref name="Gilbert1998"/&gt;

'''Misconstrual of future events''':
When predicting how an experience will impact us emotionally, events which have not been experienced are particularly difficult.  Often how we think an event may be like does not relate to how the experience is like.

'''Inaccurate theories''':
People have created cultural theories and had experiences that greatly influence beliefs of how an event will affect us.  For example, our culture has emphasized a correlation between wealth and happiness, however despite this belief; money does not necessarily bring happiness.

'''Motivated Distortions''':
When faced with a negative event people may have forecasts that are overestimated and can evoke either comfort or fear in the present.  The overestimation however can often be used to soften the effects of an event or make it easier by the reality not being as extreme as the forecasted impact.

'''Under correction (anchoring and adjustment)''':
People anchor their prediction on how they currently feel and never accurately adjust their prediction

'''Focalism''':
Often when making a prediction of the impact of an event people focus solely on the event in question.  This ignores the fact that with the passage of time, other events will occur that influence happiness.

'''Immune Neglect''':
We have unconscious psychological processes such as ego defense, dissonance reductions, self-serving biases, etc. that will cushion the effects of a negative event.

== Development in children ==
Recent evidence suggests that 3, 4 and 5 year-old children show an impact bias for the intensity of their negative future emotions, but not their positive future emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-07-01|title=Affective forecasting bias in preschool children|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096517300814|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|language=en|volume=159|pages=175–184|doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2017.02.005|issn=0022-0965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kopp|first=Leia|last2=Atance|first2=Cristina M.|last3=Pearce|first3=Sean|date=2017-09-13|title='Things aren't so bad!': Preschoolers overpredict the emotional intensity of negative outcomes|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjdp.12210|journal=British Journal of Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=623–627|doi=10.1111/bjdp.12210|issn=0261-510X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inferences''' are steps in [[reasoning]], moving from [[premise]]s to [[logical consequence]]s. [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] divided inference into three kinds: [[deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[inductive reasoning|induction]], and [[Abductive reasoning|abduction]].  Deduction is inference [[Formal proof|deriving]] [[Logical consequence|logical conclusions]] from premises known or assumed to be [[truth|true]],  with the [[Rule of inference|laws of valid inference]] being studied in [[logic]].  Induction is inference from [[particular]] premises to a [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] conclusion.  Abduction is inference to the best explanation.

Human inference (i.e. how humans draw conclusions) is traditionally studied within the field of [[cognitive psychology]]; [[artificial intelligence]] researchers develop automated inference systems to emulate human inference.

[[Statistical inference]] uses mathematics to draw conclusions in the presence of uncertainty. This generalizes deterministic reasoning, with the absence of uncertainty as a special case. Statistical inference uses quantitative or qualitative (categorical) data which may be subject to random variations.

==Definition==
The process by which a conclusion is inferred from multiple observations is called [[inductive reasoning]].  The conclusion may be correct or incorrect, or correct to within a certain degree of accuracy, or correct in certain situations.  Conclusions inferred from multiple observations may be tested by additional observations.

This definition is disputable (due to its lack of clarity. Ref: Oxford English dictionary: "induction ... 3. Logic the inference of a general law from particular instances." {{clarify|reason=Some information, probably encoded by different type fonts in the dictionary, seems to have got lost. I assume, under the keyword 'induction (logic)', the dictionary says 'the inference of a general law from particular instances'. Please check with the source and clarify.|date=August 2013}}) The definition given thus applies only when the "conclusion" is general.

Two possible definitions of "inference" are:
# A conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning.
# The process of reaching such a conclusion.

==Examples==
===Example for definition #1===
[[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophers]] defined a number of [[syllogism]]s, correct three part inferences, that can be used as building blocks for more complex reasoning. We begin with a famous example:
# All humans are mortal.
# All Greeks are humans.
# All Greeks are mortal.

The reader can check that the premises and conclusion are true, but logic is concerned with inference: does the truth of the conclusion follow from that of the premises?

The validity of an inference depends on the form of the inference. That is, the word "valid" does not refer to the truth of the premises or the conclusion, but rather to the form of the inference.  An inference can be valid even if the parts are false, and can be invalid even if some parts are true.  But a valid form with true premises will always have a true conclusion.

For example, consider the form of the following [[Symbology|symbological]] track:
#All meat comes from animals.
#All beef is meat.
#Therefore, all beef comes from animals.

If the premises are true, then the conclusion is necessarily true, too.

Now we turn to an invalid form.
#All A are B.
#All C are B.
#Therefore, all C are A.

To show that this form is invalid, we demonstrate how it can lead from true premises to a false conclusion.
#All apples are fruit. (True)
#All bananas are fruit. (True)
#Therefore, all bananas are apples. (False)

A valid argument with a false premise may lead to a false conclusion, (this and the following examples do not follow the Greek syllogism):
#All tall people are French. (False)
#John Lennon was tall. (True)
#Therefore, John Lennon was French. (False)

When a valid argument is used to derive a false conclusion from a false premise, the inference is valid because it follows the form of a correct inference.

A valid argument can also be used to derive a true conclusion from a false premise:
#All tall people are musicians. (Valid, False)
#John Lennon was tall. (Valid, True)
#Therefore, John Lennon was a musician. (Valid, True)

In this case we have one false premise and one true premise where a true conclusion has been inferred.

===Example for definition #2===

Evidence:  It is the early 1950s and you are an American stationed in the [[Soviet Union]].  You read in the [[Moscow]] newspaper that a [[soccer]] team from a small city in [[Siberia]] starts winning game after game.  The team even defeats the Moscow team.  Inference: The small city in Siberia is not a small city anymore.  The Soviets are working on their own nuclear or high-value secret weapons program.

Knowns: The Soviet Union is a [[command economy]]: people and material are told where to go and what to do.  The small city was remote and historically had never distinguished itself; its soccer season was typically short because of the weather.

Explanation:  In a [[command economy]], people and material are moved where they are needed.  Large cities might field good teams due to the greater availability of high quality players; and teams that can practice longer (weather, facilities) can reasonably be expected to be better.  In addition, you put your best and brightest in places where they can do the most good—such as on high-value weapons programs.  It is an anomaly for a small city to field such a good team.  The anomaly (i.e. the soccer scores and great soccer team) indirectly described a condition by which the observer inferred a new meaningful pattern—that the small city was no longer small.  Why would you put a large city of your best and brightest in the middle of nowhere?  To hide them, of course.

==Incorrect inference==
An incorrect inference is known as a [[fallacy]]. Philosophers who study [[informal logic]] have compiled large lists of them, and cognitive psychologists have documented many [[cognitive bias|biases in human reasoning]] that favor incorrect reasoning.

==Applications==

===Inference engines===
{{main|Reasoning system|Inference engine|expert system|business rule engine}}

AI systems first provided automated logical inference and these were once extremely popular research topics, leading to industrial applications under the form of [[expert system]]s and later [[business rule engine]]s.  More recent work on [[automated theorem proving]] has had a stronger
basis in formal logic.

An inference system's job is to extend a knowledge base automatically. The knowledge base (KB) is a set of propositions that represent what the system knows about the world. Several techniques can be used by that system to extend KB by means of valid inferences. An additional requirement is that the conclusions the system arrives at are [[relevance|relevant]] to its task.

====Prolog engine====
[[Prolog]] (for "Programming in Logic") is a [[programming language]] based on a [[subset]] of [[predicate calculus]]. Its main job is to check whether a certain proposition can be inferred from a KB (knowledge base) using an algorithm called [[backward chaining]].

Let us return to our [[Socrates]] [[syllogism]]. We enter into our Knowledge Base the following piece of code:

 mortal(X) :- 	man(X).
 man(socrates). 
( Here ''''':-''''' can be read as "if".  Generally, if ''P {{imp}} Q'' (if P then Q)  then in Prolog we would code ''Q''':-'''P'' (Q if P).)&lt;br /&gt;
This states that all men are mortal and that Socrates is a man. Now we can ask the Prolog system about Socrates:

 ?- mortal(socrates).
(where ''?-'' signifies a query: Can ''mortal(socrates).'' be deduced from the KB using the rules)
gives the answer "Yes".

On the other hand, asking the Prolog system the following:

 ?- mortal(plato).

gives the answer "No".

This is because [[Prolog]] does not know anything about [[Plato]], and hence defaults to any property about Plato being false (the so-called [[closed world assumption]]). Finally
?- mortal(X) (Is anything mortal) would result in "Yes" (and in some implementations: "Yes": X=socrates)&lt;br /&gt;
[[Prolog]] can be used for vastly more complicated inference tasks. See the corresponding article for further examples.

===Semantic web===
Recently automatic reasoners found in [[semantic web]] a new field of application. Being based upon [[description logic]], knowledge expressed using one variant of [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] can be logically processed, i.e., inferences can be made upon it.

===Bayesian statistics and probability logic===
{{main|Bayesian inference}}

Philosophers and scientists who follow the [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian framework]] for inference use the mathematical rules of [[probability]] to find this best explanation. The Bayesian view has a number of desirable features—one of them is that it embeds deductive (certain) logic as a subset (this prompts some writers to call Bayesian probability "probability logic", following [[E. T. Jaynes]]).

Bayesian's identify probabilities with degrees of beliefs, with certainly true propositions having probability 1, and certainly false propositions having probability 0. To say that "it's going to rain tomorrow" has a 0.9 probability is to say that you consider the possibility of rain tomorrow as extremely likely.

Through the rules of probability, the probability of a conclusion and of alternatives can be calculated. The best explanation is most often identified with the most probable (see [[Bayesian decision theory]]). A central rule of Bayesian inference is [[Bayes' theorem]].

=== Non-monotonic logic ===

{{main|Non-monotonic logic}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first=André  |last=Fuhrmann  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031209221248/http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/Philosophie/Fuhrmann/papers/nomoLog.pdf  |archivedate= 9 December 2003 |url=http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/Philosophie/Fuhrmann/papers/nomoLog.pdf  |title=Nonmonotonic Logic |ref=Fuhrmann, Nonmonotonic Logic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relation of inference is [[monotonicity of entailment|monotonic]] if the addition of premises does not undermine previously reached conclusions; otherwise the relation is [[Nonmonotonic logic|non-monotonic]].
Deductive inference is monotonic: if a conclusion is reached on the basis of a certain set of premises, then that conclusion still holds if more premises are added.

By contrast, everyday reasoning is mostly non-monotonic because it involves risk: we jump to conclusions from deductively insufficient premises.
We know when it is worth or even necessary (e.g. in medical diagnosis) to take the risk. Yet we are also aware that such inference is defeasible—that new information may undermine old conclusions. Various kinds of defeasible but remarkably successful inference have traditionally captured the attention of philosophers (theories of induction, Peirce's theory of [[abductive reasoning|abduction]], inference to the best explanation, etc.). More recently logicians have begun to approach the phenomenon from a formal point of view. The result is a large body of theories at the interface of philosophy, logic and artificial intelligence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4476">The '''innovation butterfly''' is a [[metaphor]] that describes how seemingly minor perturbations (disturbances or changes) to project plans in a system connecting markets, demand, product features, and a firm's capabilities can steer the project, or an entire portfolio of projects, down an irreversible path in terms of technology and market evolution.

==Origins==
The metaphor was developed by researchers Anderson and Joglekar.&lt;ref name="SysThkr"&gt;Anderson, E.G. Jr. and Joglekar, N.R. (2007). "Chasing the Innovation Butterfly with 'Systems Thinking'", ''The Systems Thinker'', 18(9): 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt; It was conceived as a specific instance of the more general '[[butterfly effect]]' encountered in [[chaos theory]].

==How it works==
The innovation butterfly arises because many innovation systems are made up of a large number of elements that interact with each other via several non-linear [[feedback loop]]s containing embedded delays, thus constituting a [[complex system]].&lt;ref&gt;Sterman, J.D. (1994). "Learning in and about Complex Systems", ''System Dynamics Review'', 10(2-3): 291-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perturbations can come from decisions made within the firm or from those made by its competitors, or they can result from external forces such as government legislation or environmental regulations, or unexpected spikes in the [[Price of petroleum|price of oil]]. How the innovation system evolves as a result of the innovation butterfly can lead ultimately to an innovative firm's success or failure.

Complex systems, in domains such as [[physics]], [[biology]], or [[sociology]], are known to be prone to both [[path dependence]] and [[emergent behavior]]. What makes the behavior of the innovation butterfly different is market selection, along with biases in individual and group decision making within distributed innovation settings, may influence the emergent behavior. Furthermore, managers in most fields of business endeavor to reduce uncertainty in order to better manage risk. In innovation settings, however, because success is based upon [[creativity]], managers must actively embrace [[uncertainty]]. This leads to a management conundrum because innovation managers and management systems must encourage the potential for a butterfly effect but then must also learn how to cope with its aftermath.&lt;ref name="Joglekar 2007 pp. 7-9"&gt;Anderson and Joglekar (2007), pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Edward G and Nitin R. Joglekar. (2012). The Innovation Butterfly: Managing Emergent Opportunities and Risks During Distributed Innovation. Springer (Understanding Complex Systems Series)"&lt;/ref&gt;

How innovation butterflies are 'chased' is highly managerially relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Edward G. and Nitin Joglekar (2005).  A Hierarchical Modeling Framework for Product Development Planning.  ''Production and Operations Management'', 14 (3): 344-361.&lt;/ref&gt; Most butterflies end up 'merely' consuming a considerable amount of time and resources within a project, or for an innovation portfolio, within a firm. However, some butterflies can also unleash [[Regime change|regime-altering]] emergent outcomes within an entire industry segment.&lt;ref&gt;Garud, R. and Karnøe, P. 2001 ‘Path Creation as a Process of Mindful Deviation’. In Path Dependence and Creation, R. Garud and P. Karnøe (eds.) Lawrence Erlbaum Associates: 1-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, once these emergent outcomes begin to mature, and in some instances lead to [[disruptive innovation]]s, they become extremely difficult to manage,&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Clayton M. (1997). The Innovator's Dilemma : When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail. Harvard Business Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, shaping the innovation system before potential innovation butterfly's effects completely emerge is critical.&lt;ref name="Joglekar 2007 pp. 7-9"/&gt;

The '''Key deer''' (''Odocoileus virginianus clavium'') is an [[endangered species|endangered]] [[deer]] that lives only in the [[Florida Keys]]. It is a subspecies of the [[white-tailed deer]] (''O. virginianus''). It is the smallest North American deer.

==Description==
This deer can be recognized by its characteristic size, smaller than all other white-tailed deer. Adult males (known as bucks) usually weigh {{convert|25|-|34|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and stand about {{convert|76|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder. Adult females (does) usually weigh between {{convert|20|and|29|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and have an average height of {{convert|66|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulders. The deer is a reddish-brown to grey-brown in color. [[Antler]]s are grown by males and shed between February and March and regrown by June. When the antlers are growing, they have a white velvet coating. The species otherwise generally resembles other white-tailed deer in appearance.

==Behavior== 
Key deer easily swim between [[island]]s. Living close to humans, they have little of the natural fear of man shown by most of their larger mainland relatives.  The deer are often found in residents' yards and along roadsides where plants and flowers grow.  This often results in car-to-deer collisions, as the deer are more active (and harder to avoid) at night.  Seeing them at dusk and dawn is not unusual.

Breeding occurs all year, but peaks in October and December. Territorial activity is limited to defending a receptive doe from other bucks. Longevity records are 9 years for males and 7 years for females. Adult females form loose matriarchal groups with one or two generations of offspring, while bucks feed and bed together only outside the breeding season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harley|first=Stephen A. Miller, John P.|title=Zoology|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston [etc.]|isbn=978-0070294110|page=28|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Range, habitat, and diet==

The range of the Key deer originally encompassed all of the lower Florida Keys (where standing water pools exist), but is now limited to a stretch of the Florida Keys from about [[Sugarloaf Key]] to [[Bahia Honda Key]]. Key deer use all islands during the [[wet season]] when drinking water is more generally available, retreating to islands with a perennial supply of fresh water in dry months.

Key deer inhabit nearly all [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s within their range, including [[South Florida rocklands#Pine rockland|pine rocklands]], [[South Florida rocklands#Rockland hammock|hardwood hammocks]], [[mangrove]]s, and [[wetland|freshwater wetlands]]. The species feeds on over 150 types of plants, but [[mangroves]] ([[Rhizophora mangle|red]], [[Laguncularia racemosa|white]], and [[Avicennia germinans|black]]) and [[thatch palm]] [[berry|berries]] make up the most important parts of their diets. Pine rockland habitat is important, as well, because it is often the only reliable source of fresh drinking water (Key deer can tolerate drinking only mildly [[brackish]] water). [[Habitat destruction]] due to human encroachment causes many deer to feed on non-native [[ornamental plant]]s.

==History==
The Key deer is a subspecies of white-tailed deer which migrated to the Florida Keys from the mainland over a [[land bridge]] during the [[Wisconsin glaciation]]. The earliest known written reference to Key deer comes from the writings of [[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]], a Spanish sailor [[shipwreck]]ed in the Florida Keys and captured by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the 1550s.

[[File:Truekeydeer.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Due to proximity, most Key deer have lost their fear of humans. This, besides habitat loss, is the main reason why they have become endangered.]]

===Endangered status===
Key deer were hunted as a food supply by native tribes, passing sailors, and early settlers. Hunting them was banned in 1939, but widespread [[poaching]] and [[habitat destruction]] caused the subspecies to plummet to near-extinction by the 1950s. The [[National Key Deer Refuge]], a federally administered [[National Wildlife Refuge]] operated by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Wildlife Service]], was established in 1967.

Recent population estimates put the population between 700 and 800, putting it on the list of endangered species. Road kills from drivers on [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|US 1]], which traverses the deer's small range, are also a major threat, averaging between 125 and 150 kills per year, 70% of the annual mortality.

However, the population has made an encouraging rise since 1955, when population estimates ranged as low as 25, and appears to have stabilized in recent years. Still, recent human encroachment into the fragile habitat and the deer's relatively low rate of reproduction point to an uncertain future for the subspecies.

===Screw worm infestation===
In September 2016, a [[Cochliomyia hominivorax|screw worm infestation]] was discovered (the first infestation of its kind in the U.S. since 1982) to be affecting the Key deer population, necessitating the euthanasia of affected animals. The screw worm is a fly larva that enters an open wound of a live animal and eats the flesh of the animal from within, leading to a gruesome death. The female fly mates once in her life, so the infestation can be battled by introducing sterile flies to the population, causing the females to die out without laying fertile eggs. Other steps to battle the outbreak included injecting deer with antiparasitic drugs, fencing off healthy sections of the population, and tracking a portion of deer with radio collars. The pest was declared as eradicated in April 2017. The outbreak killed 135 deer, roughly an eighth of the herd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flkeysnews.com/news/local/article105665836.html|publisher=[[FLKeysNews.com]]|accessdate=2016-11-01|date=2016-10-03|title=Deadly fly larvae infests federally endangered Key deer population, more than 40 are euthanized}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article109139952.html|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=2016-11-01|date=2016-10-19|title=Attack of the flesh-eating screwworm pushes up Key deer death toll}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article111624052.html|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=2016-11-01|date=2016-10-31|title=Healthy Key deer may be corralled to save herd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article144158319.html|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=2017-06-23|date=2017-04-12|title=Flesh-eating fly outbreak that infested rare Key deer is over, feds say}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
Conservation efforts include the establishment of the National Key Deer Refuge, which consists of about {{convert|8500|acre|km2|abbr=on}} on Big Pine, No Name Key, and several smaller uninhabited islands. Not all of the refuge lands are protected as public lands; despite extensive efforts of the refuge to purchase these private habitat lands for protection in the refuge, about {{convert|5000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} currently remain in private ownership and can potentially be developed. About {{convert|1000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} of this privately developable land is on Big Pine Key and No Name Key, which are the central population areas for the deer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}
In 2006, a habitat conservation plan was enacted by Monroe County and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which will limit development in primary habitat and provide for additional habitat purchases over the next 15 years. At the end of this period, however, most of the {{convert|1000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} of privately owned habitat land on Big Pine and No Name Keys will still be open for further development. Thus, while the short term promises some cushion from extinction, the long-term prospects for the deer remain in doubt.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

A portion of US Route 1 was also elevated in 2003 to allow the deer to pass safely beneath the roadway, in an attempt to lessen the chance of road kills. However, no decrease in total traffic deaths has been seen.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The National Key Deer Refuge encourages people to help keep the Key deer wild by not feeding them.  Feeding acclimates them to humans and vehicles, and makes them more likely to be hit and killed by vehicles.  Also, hanging around people and developed areas in higher than normal densities makes them more susceptible to diseases, dog attacks, and entanglements in human trash, all of which can lead to increased injuries or death.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

{{Grammatical categories}}

In [[linguistics]], '''modality''' is a feature of language that allows for communicating things about, or based on, situations which need not be actual. More precisely, modality is signaled by grammatical expressions (''moods'') that express a speaker's general intentions (or illocutionary point) as well as the speaker's commitment to how believable, obligatory, desirable, or actual an expressed [[proposition]] is.

Sometimes, the term ''mood'' is used to refer to both mood and modality, however, the two can be distinguished according to whether they refer to the grammatical expressions of various modalities (''mood'') or the meanings so expressed (''modality''). Modality can also be considered equivalent to the idea of ''[[illocutionary force]]'' if the kinds of expressions which can express modal meanings also include [[lexical items]] such as [[performative]] verbs.

Modality is closely intertwined with other linguistic phenomena such as [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[evidentiality]], [[Conditional mood|conditionals]], and others. As with other areas of linguistics, modality has been studied extensively from typological as well as formal perspectives.

An important distinction within linguistic modality is the distinction between [[epistemic]] and [[deontic]] modality. Generally speaking, epistemic modality has to do with possibility and necessity with regard to knowledge, whereas deontic modality has to do with permission and obligation according to some system of rules. The difference between the two is illustrated in the English example below:
: (1) Agatha ''must'' be the killer.
: (2) Agatha ''must'' be killed.
The sentence in (1) might be spoken by someone who has decided that all of the relevant facts in a particular murder investigation point to the conclusion that Agatha is the killer, even though it may or may not actually be the case. In contrast, (2) might be spoken by someone who has decided that, according to some standard of conduct, Agatha has committed a vile crime, and therefore the correct course of action is to kill Agatha. Note also that, although English ''must'' is ambiguous between these two interpretations, the form of the other elements in the sentences helps to disambiguate.

In standard formal approaches to '''linguistic modality''', an utterance expressing modality is one that can always roughly be paraphrased to fit the following template:

:(1) According to [a set of rules, wishes, beliefs,...] it is [necessary, possible] that [the main proposition] is the case.

The set of propositions which forms the basis of evaluation is called the '''modal base'''. The result of the evaluation is called the '''modal force'''.
For example the utterance in (2) expresses that, according to what the speaker has observed, it is necessary to conclude that John has a rather high income:

:(2) John must be earning a lot of money.

The modal base here is the knowledge of the speaker, the modal force is necessity. By contrast, (3) could be paraphrased as ‘Given his abilities, the strength of his teeth, etc., it is possible for John to open a beer bottle with his teeth’. Here, the modal base is defined by a subset of John's abilities, the modal force is possibility.

:(3) John can open a beer bottle with his teeth.

A more elaborate account of formal semantic approaches to modality is given in section 1.

Cross-linguistically, modality can be expressed by a variety of means, such as [[auxiliary verbs]] as in the examples (2) and (3),  verbal morphology ([[grammatical mood|mood]]) or adverbs. An overview of the various modal expressions across languages is given below in section 2.

[[Linguistic typology|Typological]] approaches to modality usually favour a slightly wider definition of modality and also include meanings which do not fit the template in (1) exactly. Section 3 provides an overview over the range of meanings commonly associated with modality.

==Semantic accounts==

Semantic approaches dealing with modality are traditionally based on the principles of [[modal logic]]. Both work with the notion that propositions can be mapped to sets of possible worlds, that is, a proposition can be defined as the set of worlds in which that proposition is true. For example, the proposition ‘the earth is flat’ corresponds to the set of possible worlds in which the earth is in fact flat.

In this framework, modal expressions such as ''must'' and ''can'' are then analyzed as quantifiers over a set of possible worlds. This set of worlds is given by the modal base and is said to be ''the set of accessible worlds'': For example, in sentence (2) above, the modal base is the knowledge the speaker has in the actual world. Therefore, the set of accessible worlds is defined by the information the speaker has about John. Assume for example that the speaker knows that John just bought a new luxury car and has rented a huge apartment. The speaker also knows that John is an honest person with a humble family background and doesn't play the lottery.
The set of accessible worlds is then the set of worlds in which all these propositions which the speaker knows about John are true.

The notions of '''necessity''' and '''possibility''' are then defined along the following lines: A proposition ''p'' follows necessarily from the set of accessible worlds, if all accessible worlds are part of ''p'' (that is, if ''p'' is true in all of these worlds). Applied to the example in (2) this would mean that in all the worlds which are defined by the speaker's knowledge about John, it is the case that John earns a lot of money (assuming there is no other explanation for John's wealth).

In a similar way a proposition ''p'' is possible according to the set of accessible worlds (i.e. the modal base), if some of these worlds are part of ''p''.

==Ways of expressing modality==

===Verbal Morphology===
{{Main article|Grammatical mood}}

In many languages modal categories are expressed by verbal morphology. If these verbal markers of modality are obligatory in a language, they are called [[Grammatical mood|''mood'']] markers. Well-known examples of moods in some European languages are referred to as [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[Conditional mood|conditional]] and [[Indicative mood|indicative]] as illustrated below with examples from [[French language|French]], all three with the verb ''avoir'' ‘to have’. As in most [[Standard Average European|Standard European]] languages, the shape of the verb conveys not only information about modality, but also about other categories such as [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]] of the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]].

An example for a non-European language with a similar encoding of modality is [[Manam language|Manam]]. Here, a verb is prefixed by a [[morpheme]] which encodes number and person of the subject. These prefixes come in two versions, one ''realis'' version and one ''irrealis'' version. Which one is chosen depends on whether the verb refers to an actual past or present event (realis), or merely to a possible or imagined event (irrealis) (see [[#elliott2000|Elliott 2000]]).

===Auxiliaries===
{{Main article|Modal verb}}

Modal [[auxiliary verb]]s, such as the English words ''may, can, must, ought, will, shall, need, dare, might, could, would,'' and ''should'', are often used to express modality, especially in the [[Germanic languages]].

===Lexical expression===

[[Verb]]s such as "want" can be used to express modality [[lexical (semiotics)|lexically]], as can [[adverb]]s.

===Other===

Complementizers (e.g. Russian) and conjunctions (e.g. Central Pomo, see [[#mithun1995|Mithun 1995]]) can be used to convey modality.

==Modal Categories==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

Many different kinds of modal interpretations have been observed and studied, resulting in a variety of typologies. What follows below is one of the many ways that modality has been classified. Only broad categories have been distinguished below: the reader is referred to the main articles and the references for more detailed discussions.

===Realis vs. Irrealis===

The closely related [[realis mood|realis]], [[declarative mood|declarative]], and [[evidential mood]]s refer to situations that actually exist, are claimed to exist, or are inferred to exist. In contrast, [[irrealis mood]]s refer to situations that are not known to exist. Two common irrealis moods are the [[conditional mood]], stating what would happen under a certain condition or conditions (expressed periphrastically in English as ''would'' + main verb), and the [[subjunctive mood]], stating the speaker's preferences for what should occur (such as ''he leave'' in the English ''I demand that he leave'') or hypotheticals (such as English ''If I were to go,....'').

[[Counterfactual conditional#Examples|Counterfactuals]] refer to things that are contrary to the actual situation. In English, counterfactuals can be expressed implicitly in [[If clause|"if"-clauses]] by using a tense form that normally refers to a time prior to the time actually semantically referred to in the ''if''-clause. For example, ''If I knew that, I wouldn't have to ask'' contains the counterfactual ''If I knew'', which refers to the present tense despite the form of the verb, and which denies the proposition "I know that". This contrasts with the construction ''If I know that,...'', which is not a counterfactual because it means that maybe I know it and maybe I don't (or maybe I will know it, and maybe I will not). Likewise, ''If I had known that, I would have gone there'' contains the counterfactual ''If I had known'', denying the proposition that I had known; a note of caution on the above: the [[pluperfect]] verbal construction is sometimes mistakenly confused with the simple past, this is because most of the time the distinction has a very small effect on the semantic interpretation, and the incorrect logic that, through inertia, prior knowledge of X implies present knowledge of X, however this is not universal, (e.g. memory loss), a correct modal statement would look like "prior knowledge of X ''usually'' implies present knowledge of X". as with any subtlety, caution is prescribed.

===Epistemic vs. deontic modality===
{{Main article|Epistemic modality|Deontic modality}}
Epistemic modals are used to indicate the possibility or necessity of some piece of knowledge. It deals with the likelihood of the actualization of the state of affairs. In the epistemic use, modals can be interpreted as indicating inference or some other process of reasoning involved in coming to the conclusion stated in the sentence containing the modal. However, epistemic modals do not necessarily require inference, reasoning, or evidence. One effect of using an epistemic modal (as opposed to not using one) is a general weakening of the speaker's commitment to the truth of the sentence containing the modal. However, it is disputed whether the function of modals is to indicate this weakening of commitment, or whether the weakening is a by-product of some other aspect of the modal's meaning.

Examples of the expression of epistemic modality in English are: ''he might be there'' (low probability, substantial doubt), ''He may be there'' (possibility), ''He should be there by now'' (high probability), and ''He must be there by now'' (certitude, no doubt).

In contrast, [[deontic modality]] is concerned with possibility and necessity in terms of freedom to act (including ability, permission, and duty). In other words, deontic modals state something about the desirability of the actualization of the state of affairs, expressed in varying degrees of obligation. English examples include ''She can go'' (ability), ''You may go'' (permission), ''You should go'' (request), and ''You must go'' (command). In English as in many other languages, some of the same words are used for deontic modality as for epistemic modality, and the meaning is distinguished from context: ''He must be there by now'' (epistemic) versus ''He must be there tomorrow at noon'' (deontic).

The '''Museum of Comparative Zoology''', full name "The Louis Agassiz Museum of Comparative Zoology", often abbreviated simply to "MCZ", is the [[zoology]] museum located on the grounds of [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. It is one of three natural history research museums at Harvard whose public face is the [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]]. Harvard MCZ's collections consist of some 21 million specimens, of which several thousand are on rotating display at the public museum.  The current director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology is [[James Hanken]], the Louis Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard University.

Many of the exhibits in the public museum have not only zoological interest but also historical significance. Past exhibits have included a [[fossil]] [[sand dollar]] which was found by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1834, Captain Cook's [[mamo]], and two [[pheasant]]s that once belonged to [[George Washington]], now on loan to Mount Vernon in Virginia.

The Harvard Museum of Natural History is physically connected to the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]]; for visitors, one admission ticket grants access to both museums. The research collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology are not open to the public.

==History==
The Museum of Comparative Zoology was founded in 1859 through the efforts of zoologist [[Louis Agassiz]], and the museum used to be referred to as "The Agassiz" after its founder.&lt;ref&gt;Winsor, Mary P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w6vLeToUzHEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=reading+the+shape+of+nature&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7qvSLpLfZAhWFPN8KHUbnBN4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=reading%20the%20shape%20of%20nature&amp;f=false Reading the Shape of Nature: Comparative Zoology at the Agassiz Museum] (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  Agassiz designed the collection to illustrate the variety and [[Comparative anatomy|comparative relationships]] of [[animal]] life.

The [[Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory]] was created in 1894 when [[Radcliffe College]] rented a space on the fifth floor of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University to convert into a women's laboratory. Prior to this acquisition, Radcliffe science laboratories were taught using inadequate facilities, converting spaces such as bathrooms in old houses into physics laboratories, which Harvard professors often refused to teach in&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=HUL Access/2.0|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/1468-0424.12292/abstract|doi=10.1111/1468-0424.12292/epdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.The laboratory space was converted from an office or storage closet, and was sandwiched between other invertebrate storage rooms on the fifth floor.

==Departments==
The museum comprises twelve departments: [[Biological Oceanography]], [[Entomology]], [[Herpetology]], [[Ichthyology]], [[Invertebrate paleontology|Invertebrate Paleontology]], [[Invertebrate zoology|Invertebrate Zoology]], [[Mammalogy]], [[Marine invertebrates]], [[Malacology]], [[Ornithology]], [[Population Genetics]], and [[Vertebrate Paleontology]].  The [[Ernst Mayr|Ernst Mayr Library]] and its archives join in supporting the work of the museum.  The Ernst Mayr Library is a founding member of the [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org Biodiversity Heritage Library].

==Publications==
The museum publishes two journals: the ''Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College'', first published in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/2803|website=Biodiversity Heritage Library|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Breviora'', first published in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breviora|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/3989|website=Biodiversity Heritage Library|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Displays==
In contrast to numerous more modern museums, the Harvard Museum of Natural History has many hundreds of [[taxidermy|stuffed animals]] on display, from the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.  Notable exhibits include [[whale]] [[skeleton]]s, the largest [[turtle]] [[Animal shell|shell]] ever found (eight feet long), "the Harvard [[mastodon]]", a {{convert|42|ft|m|sing=on}} long ''[[Kronosaurus]]'' skeleton, the skeleton of a [[dodo]], and a [[coelacanth]] preserved in fluid. The two-story Great Mammal Hall was renovated in 2009 in celebration of the 150th anniversary of founding of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.

In a 1927 letter to Sigmund Freud, [[Romain Rolland]] coined the phrase "'''oceanic feeling'''" to refer to the sensation of being one with the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |last=Roberts |first=Robert |editor=[[Edward N. Zalta|Zalta, Edward N.]] |title=Emotions in the Christian Tradition |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotion-Christian-tradition/ |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |volume=Winter 2016 |date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rolland, this feeling is the source of all the religious energy that permeates in various religious systems, and one may justifiably call oneself religious on the basis of this oceanic feeling alone, even if one renounces every belief and every illusion.&lt;ref&gt;The Ontology of Religiosity: The Oceanic Feeling and the Value of the Lived Experience&lt;/ref&gt; Freud discusses the feeling in his ''[[The Future of an Illusion|Future of an Illusion]]'' (1927) and ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1929). There he deems it a fragmentary vestige of a kind of consciousness possessed by an infant who has not yet differentiated himself or herself from other people and things.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'', [http://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FreudS-CIVILIZATION-AND-ITS-DISCONTENTS-text-final.pdf pp. 11–13].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On December 5, 1927, Rolland coined the phrase in a [[Romain Rolland#Correspondence with Freud|letter to Freud]]:

{{quote|''Mais j'aurais aimé à vous voir faire l'analyse du sentiment religieux spontané ou, plus exactement, de la ''sensation'' religieuse qui est...le fait simple et direct de ''la sensation de l'Eternel'' (qui peut très bien n'être pas éternel, mais simplement sans bornes perceptibles, et comme océanique).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeffrey Moussaieff |last=Masson |authorlink=Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson |title=The Oceanic Feeling. The Origins of Religious Sentiment in Ancient India |url=https://books.google.com/?id=swsrBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |date=6 December 2012 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=vBRnmMts8e4C 1st ed.: 1980] |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=swsrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%22Mais+j'aurais+aimé+à+vous+voir+faire+l'analyse%22%22de+la+sensation+de+l'Eternel+(qui+peut+très+bien+n'étre+pas+éternel,+mais+simplement+sans+bornes+perceptibles,+et+comme+océanique%22 34] |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |id={{ISBN|9-40098969-5}} |isbn=978-9-400-98969-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In strict translation:

{{quote|But I would have liked to see you doing an analysis of ''spontaneous religious sentiment'' or, more exactly, of religious ''feeling'', which is...the simple and direct fact ''of the feeling of the ‘eternal’'' (which can very well not be eternal, but simply without perceptible limits, and like oceanic, as it were).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William B. |last=Parsons |title=The Enigma of the Oceanic Feeling. Revisioning the Psychoanalytic Theory of Mysticism |url=https://books.google.com/?id=keNYGu3bjOUC&amp;printsec=frontcover |date=17 June 1999 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=keNYGu3bjOUC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22But+I+would+have+liked+to+see+you+doing+an+analysis+of%22%22the+feeling+of+the+‘eternal’+(which+can+very+well+not+be+eternal,+but+simply+without+perceptible+limits,+and+like+oceanic+as+it+were).%22 36] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |id={{ISBN|0-19535408-7}} |isbn=978-0-195-35408-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Freud ends ''The Future of an Illusion'' with a discussion of the concept, and picks up the discussion at the beginning of ''Civilization and Its Discontents'', answering Rolland's request. There he credits the concept to an anonymous friend.

== Freud's explanation ==
Freud argues that the "oceanic feeling", if it exists, is the preserved "primitive ego-feeling" from infancy.  The primitive ego-feeling precedes the creation of the ego and exists up until the mother ceases breastfeeding. Prior to this, the infant is regularly breastfed in response to its crying and has no concept that the breast does not belong to it.  Therefore, the infant has no concept of a "self" or, rather, considers the breast to be part of itself. Freud argues that those experiencing an oceanic feeling as an adult are actually experiencing a preserved primitive ego-feeling. The ego, in contrast, comes into existence when the breast is taken away, and involves the infant's recognition that it is separate from the mother's breast, and therefore, that other people exist.  Freud argues that it would not necessarily contradict psychoanalytical theory for this primary ego-feeling to coexist along with the ego in some people. The main argument for this is that psychoanalytical theory holds that all thoughts are preserved in a conservation of psychic energy. Therefore, the "oceanic feeling" described as a oneness with the world or a limitlessness is simply a description of the feeling the infant has before it learns there are other persons in the world.

== Neuroscientific explanation ==
{{Main article|Neuroscience of religion}}

"Neurotheology" is a [[neologism]] that describes the scientific study of the neural correlates of religious or spiritual beliefs and practices. Other researchers have rejected the term, preferring to use terms like "spiritual neuroscience" or "neuroscience of religion". Researchers in the field attempt to explain the neurological basis for religious experiences, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert A. |last=Burton |authorlink=Robert A. Burton |title=On Being Certain. Believing You Are Right Even When You're Not |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PsYEOdPj78gC&amp;printsec=frontcover |chapter=Neurotheology |chapterurl=https://books.google.it/?id=PsYEOdPj78gC&amp;pg=PT36&amp;dq=neurotheology+%22oneness+with+the+universe%22%22awe,+joy+and+a+general+sense+of+harmony+and+deep+significance%22 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]/[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York City |date=5 February 2008}} {{ISBN|1-42992611-2}}; {{ISBN|978-1-429-92611-9}} (Macmillan Publishers edition). {{ISBN|0-31235920-9}}; {{ISBN|978-0-312-35920-1}} (St. Martin's Press edition).&lt;/ref&gt; the perception that [[time]], [[fear]] or [[self-awareness|self-consciousness]] have dissolved; [[supernatural|spiritual]] awe; [[Monism|oneness]] with the universe; ecstatic [[altered state of consciousness|trance]]; sudden [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]; and [[altered states of consciousness]].

What [[Andrew B. Newberg]] and others "discovered is that intensely focused [[meditation|spiritual contemplation]] triggers an alteration in the activity of the brain that leads one to perceive transcendent religious experiences as solid, tangible reality. In other words, the sensation that [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] call ''oneness with the universe''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Newberg, Andrew B. |authorlink=Andrew B.

==Orgel's First Rule==
"Whenever a [[spontaneous process]] is too slow or too inefficient a [[protein]] will evolve to speed it up or make it more efficient."

This "rule" comments on the fact that there are a great number of proteins in all organisms which fulfil a number of different functions through modifying chemical or physical processes. An example would be an [[enzyme]] that [[Catalysis|catalyses]] a [[chemical reaction]] that would take place too slowly to benefit an organism without being sped up by this enzyme.

==Orgel's Second Rule==
"[[Evolution]] is cleverer than you are."

This rule is well known among biologists. It does not imply that evolution has conscious motives or method but that people who say "evolution can't do this" or "evolution can't do that" are simply lacking an imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/2007/11/orgels-second-rule-and-unbeatable/ |title=Orgel’s Second Rule and "unbeatable" predation tactics. |author=T.

Orgel's second rule tells us that the process of natural selection is not itself intelligent, clever or purposeful but that the products of evolution are ingenious.&lt;ref name="Le Comber pp. 189–189"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Le Comber | first=S C | title=The genetic code has a ‘shift’ key | journal=Heredity | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=103 | issue=3 | date=2009-04-22 | issn=0018-067X | doi=10.1038/hdy.2009.40 | pages=189–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|pacifism}}
'''Pacificism''' is the general term for [[ethical]] opposition to [[violence]] or [[war]], except in cases where force is deemed absolutely necessary to advance the cause of [[peace]].

It falls between [[pacifism]], which usually states that killing, violence or war is unconditionally wrong in all cases, and [[defensivism]], which accepts all ''defensive'' wars and acts of deterrence as morally just.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.westernherald.com/media/storage/paper881/news/2002/10/10/Opinion/Pacifism.Cannot.Hold.Up.Under.Scrutiny-2127363.shtml Western Herald - Pacifism cannot hold up under scrutiny] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629055802/http://media.www.westernherald.com/media/storage/paper881/news/2002/10/10/Opinion/Pacifism.Cannot.Hold.Up.Under.Scrutiny-2127363.shtml |date=2008-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacificism states that war can only ever be considered as a firm "last resort", condemning both [[aggression]] and [[militarism]]. In the 1940s, the two terms were not conceptually distinguished and pacificism was considered merely as an archaic spelling, although less 'barbarous' than the more common and shorter form.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinct theory was first put forward by [[A. J. P. Taylor]] in ''The Trouble-Makers'' (1957)&lt;ref&gt;‘By ‘pacificism’ I mean the advocacy of a peaceful policy; by ‘pacifism’ (a word invented only in the twentieth century) the doctrine of non-resistance. The latter is the negation of policy, not an alternative, and therefore irrelevant to my theme. Hence my disregard for the Peace Societies.’  AJP Taylor, ''The Trouble-Makers'', London: H Hamilton, 1957, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently defined by Martin Ceadel in his 1987 book, ''Thinking About Peace and War''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/pacifism.htm#SH2c Pacifism - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/peaceed/pe_debate.html Pledge Peace Union - Debating Peace and War]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also discussed in detail in [[Richard Norman]]'s book: ''Ethics, Killing and War''.

The largest national peace association in history, the British [[League of Nations Union]], was pacificist rather than pacifist in orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Birn, ''The League of Nations Union'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the majority of peace activists have been pacificists rather than strict pacifists.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ceadel, ''Semi Detached Idealists: The British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1854-1945'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paranoia''' is an instinct or thought process believed to be heavily influenced by [[anxiety]] or [[fear]], often to the point of [[delusion]] and [[irrationality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/paranoia World English Dictionary] (Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition, 2009, William Collins Sons &amp; Co. Ltd.) 3. informal sense: ''intense fear or suspicion, esp when unfounded''&lt;/ref&gt; Paranoid thinking typically includes [[persecutory]], or beliefs of [[wikt:conspiracy|conspiracy]] concerning a perceived threat towards oneself (e.g. the American colloquial phrase, ''"Everyone is out to get me"''). Paranoia is distinct from [[phobia]]s, which also involve irrational fear, but usually no blame. Making [[false accusations]] and the general [[distrust]] of others also frequently accompany paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=https://www.livescience.com/3064-freak-paranoia-common.html |title=Don't Freak Out: Paranoia Quite Common |website=[[Live Science]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=November 12, 2008 |accessdate=September 16, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an incident most people would view as an [[accident]] or [[coincidence]], a paranoid person might believe was [[intention]]al. Paranoia is a central symptom of [[psychosis]].&lt;ref name=Green08&gt;Green, C., Freeman, D., Kuipers, E., Bebbington, P., Fowler, D., Dunn, G., &amp; Garety, P. (2008). Measuring ideas of persecution and social reference: the Green et al. Paranoid Thought Scales (GPTS). ''Psychological Medicine, 38'', 101 - 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
A popular symptom of paranoia is the [[attribution bias]]. These individuals typically have a biased perception of reality, often exhibiting more hostile beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bentall and Taylor (2006), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; A paranoid person may view someone else's accidental behavior as though it is with intent or threatening.

An investigation of a non-clinical paranoid population found that feeling powerless and depressed, isolating oneself, and relinquishing activities are characteristics that could be associated with those exhibiting more frequent paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman et al. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
Some scientists have created different subtypes for the various symptoms of paranoia including erotic, persecutory, litigious, and exalted.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch and Fishman p. 1414-1415&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the suspicious and troublesome personality traits of paranoia, it is unlikely that someone with paranoia will thrive in interpersonal relationships. Most commonly paranoid individuals tend to be of a single status.&lt;ref&gt;Deutch and Fishman (1963), p.1416&lt;/ref&gt; According to some research there is a hierarchy for paranoia. The least common types of paranoia at the very top of the hierarchy would be those involving more serious threats. [[Social anxiety]] is at the bottom of this hierarchy as the most frequently exhibited level of paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman et al. (2005), p.433&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
===Social and environmental===
Social circumstances appear to be highly influential on paranoid beliefs. Based on data collected by means of a mental health survey distributed to residents of [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]] (in Mexico) and [[El Paso, Texas]] (in the United States), paranoid beliefs seem to be associated with feelings of powerlessness and victimization, enhanced by social situations. Potential causes of these effects included a sense of believing in external control, and mistrust which can be strengthened by lower socioeconomic status. Those living in a lower socioeconomic status may feel less in control of their own lives. In addition, this study explains that females have the tendency to believe in external control at a higher rate than males, potentially making females more susceptible to mistrust and the effects of socioeconomic status on paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;Mirowski and Ross (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

Emanuel Messinger reports that surveys have revealed that those exhibiting paranoia can evolve from parental relationships and untrustworthy environments. These environments could include being very disciplinary, stringent, and unstable. It was even noted that, "indulging and pampering (thereby impressing the child that he is something special and warrants special privileges)," can be contributing backgrounds.&lt;ref name=D&amp;F &gt;Deutsch and Fishman (1963), p. 1408&lt;/ref&gt; Experiences likely to enhance or manifest the symptoms of paranoia include increased rates of disappointment, stress, and a hopeless state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch and Fishman (1963), p. 1412&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrimination has also been reported as a potential predictor of paranoid delusions. Such reports that paranoia seemed to appear more in older patients who had experienced higher levels of discrimination throughout their lives. In addition to this it has been noted that immigrants are quite susceptible to forms of psychosis. This could be due to the aforementioned effects of discriminatory events and humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Bentall and Taylor (2006), p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
While many more mood-based symptoms, grandiosity and guilt, may underlie functional paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lake|first=C. R.|date=2008-11-01|title=Hypothesis: Grandiosity and Guilt Cause Paranoia; Paranoid Schizophrenia is a Psychotic Mood Disorder; a Review|url=https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/34/6/1151/1936006/Hypothesis-Grandiosity-and-Guilt-Cause-Paranoia|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|language=en|volume=34|issue=6|pages=1151–1162|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm132|issn=0586-7614|pmc=2632512|pmid=18056109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colby (1981) defined ''paranoid cognition'' in terms of ''persecutory delusions and false beliefs whose propositional content clusters around ideas of being harassed, threatened, harmed, subjugated, persecuted, accused, mistreated, wronged, tormented, disparaged, vilified, and so on, by malevolent others, either specific individuals or groups'' (p.&amp;nbsp;518).
Three components of paranoid cognition have been identified by Robins &amp; Post: ''a) suspicions without enough basis that others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving them; b) preoccupation with unjustified doubts about the loyalty, or trustworthiness, of friends or associates; c) reluctance to confide in others because of unwarranted fear that the information will be used maliciously against them'' (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;3).

Paranoid cognition has been conceptualized by clinical psychology almost exclusively in terms of psychodynamic constructs and dispositional variables. From this point of view, paranoid cognition is a manifestation of an intra-psychic conflict or disturbance. For instance, Colby (1981) suggested that the biases of blaming others for one’s problems serve to alleviate the distress produced by the feeling of being humiliated, and helps to repudiate the belief that the self is to blame for such incompetence. This intra-psychic perspective emphasize that the cause of paranoid cognitions are inside the head of the people (social perceiver), and dismiss the fact that paranoid cognition may be related with the social context in which such cognitions are embedded. This point is extremely relevant because when origins of distrust and suspicion (two components of paranoid cognition) are studied many researchers have accentuated the importance of social interaction, particularly when social interaction has gone awry. Even more, a model of trust development pointed out that trust increases or decreases as a function of the cumulative history of interaction between two or more persons.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

Another relevant difference can be discerned among "pathological and non-pathological forms of trust and distrust". According to Deutsch, the main difference is that non-pathological forms are flexible and responsive to changing circumstances. Pathological forms reflect exaggerated perceptual biases and judgmental predispositions that can arise and perpetuate them, are reflexively caused errors similar to a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].

It has been suggested that a "hierarchy" of paranoia exists, extending from mild social evaluative concerns, through ideas of social reference, to persecutory beliefs concerning mild, moderate, and severe threats.&lt;ref name=Freeman05&gt;Freeman, D., Garety, P., Bebbington, P., Smith, B., Rollinson, R., Fowler, D., Kuipers, E., Ray, K., &amp; Dunn, G. (2005). Psychological investigation of the structure of paranoia in a non-clinical population. ''British Journal of Psychiatry 186'', 427 – 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical===
A paranoid reaction may be caused from a decline in brain circulation as a result of high blood pressure or hardening of the arterial walls.&lt;ref name=D&amp;F/&gt;

Drug-induced paranoia, associated with [[amphetamines]], [[methamphetamine]] and similar [[stimulants]] has much in common with schizophrenic paranoia; the relationship has been under investigation since 2012. Drug-induced paranoia has a better prognosis than schizophrenic paranoia once the drug has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Amphetamine-induced psychosis - a separate diagnostic entity or primary psychosis triggered in the vulnerable?|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=12|pages=221|pmc=3554477|year=2012|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-12-221|pmid=23216941|author1=Bramness|first1=J.

During the 1960s with the increase of the use of marijuana, LSD, and other drugs in places like California, paranoia began to set in with many individuals.  Some thought that because there was illegality in the use of the drugs – the fear of police catching the individuals was bothering them. Professionals felt, however, that those drugs brought on paranoia. 

Based on data obtained by the Dutch NEMISIS project in 2005, there was an association between impaired hearing and the onset of symptoms of psychosis, which was based on a five-year follow up. Some older studies have actually declared that a state of paranoia can be produced in patients that were under a hypnotic state of deafness. This idea however generated much skepticism during its time.&lt;ref name="paranoia"&gt;Bentall and Taylor (2006), p.281&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
In the [[DSM-IV-TR]], paranoia is diagnosed in the form of:&lt;ref&gt;[[American Psychiatric Association]]. ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Paranoid personality disorder]]&lt;ref&gt;[[American Psychiatric Association]]. ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' p.690&lt;/ref&gt; ({{ICD10|F|60|0|f|60}})
* [[Paranoid schizophrenia]] (a subtype of [[schizophrenia]]) ({{ICD10|F|20|0|f|20}})
* The [[persecutory delusions|persecutory]] type of [[delusional disorder]], which is also called "[[querulous paranoia]]" when the focus is to remedy some injustice by legal action&lt;ref&gt;[[American Psychiatric Association]]. ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' p.325&lt;/ref&gt; ({{ICD10|F|22|8|f|20}})
Persecutory type does not exist. This is a false information. In 2015 year the persecutory type was not considered, there it was no information online about such classification.

According to [[Clinical psychology|clinical psychologist]] P. J. McKenna, "As a noun, paranoia denotes a disorder which has been argued in and out of existence, and whose clinical features, course, boundaries, and virtually every other aspect of which is controversial. Employed as an adjective, paranoid has become attached to a diverse set of presentations, from paranoid schizophrenia, through paranoid depression, to paranoid personality&amp;mdash;not to mention a motley collection of paranoid 'psychoses', 'reactions', and 'states'&amp;mdash;and this is to restrict discussion to [[functional disorders]]. Even when abbreviated down to the prefix para-, the term crops up causing trouble as the contentious but stubbornly persistent concept of [[paraphrenia]]".&lt;ref&gt;McKenna (1997), p.238&lt;/ref&gt;

At least 50% of the diagnosed cases of [[schizophrenia]] experience delusions of reference and delusions of persecution.&lt;ref name=Sartorius86&gt;Sartorius, N., Jablensky, A., Korten, A., Ernberg, G., Anker, M., Cooper, JE., &amp; Day, R. (1986). Early manifestations and first-contact incidence of schizophrenia in different cultures. ''Psychological Medicine, 16'', 909 – 928.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutting97&gt;Cutting, J. (1997). ''Principles of Psychopathology : Two Worlds–Two Minds–Two Hemispheres.'' Oxford University Press: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Paranoia perceptions and behavior may be part of many mental illnesses, such as depression and dementia, but they are more prevalent in three mental disorders: [[paranoid schizophrenia]], [[delusional disorder]] ([[Persecutory delusion|persecutory type]]), and [[paranoid personality disorder]].

==History==
The word ''paranoia'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] παράνοια (''paranoia''), "[[Insanity|madness]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2Fnoia^ παράνοια],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and that from παρά (''para''), "beside, by"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2F παρά], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and νόος (''noos''), "mind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dno%2Fos νόος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; However, the history of the term is not the history of the concept, let alone the mental condition currently considered as a disease. Indeed, the historiography of ‘paranoia’ is complicated and must be approached with care. &lt;ref&gt;Berrios G E (2009) How to write a good history of paranoia. ''Rivista Sperimentale di Freniatria'' 133: 109-121.&lt;/ref&gt;The term was used to describe a mental illness in which a delusional belief is the sole or most prominent feature.  In this definition, the belief does not have to be persecutory to be classified as paranoid, so any number of delusional beliefs can be classified as paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0957154X0001104103&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person who has the sole delusional belief that they are an important religious figure would be classified by Kraepelin as having 'pure paranoia'.

According to Michael Phelan, Padraig Wright, and Julian Stern (2000),&lt;ref&gt;Phelan, Wright, and Stern (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; paranoia and [[paraphrenia]] are debated entities that were detached from [[dementia praecox]] by Kraepelin, who explained paranoia as a continuous systematized delusion arising much later in life with no presence of either hallucinations or a deteriorating course, paraphrenia as an identical syndrome to paranoia but with hallucinations. Even at the present time, a delusion need not be suspicious or fearful to be classified as paranoid. A person might be diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia without delusions of persecution, simply because their delusions refer mainly to themselves.

==Relations to violence==
It has generally been agreed upon that individuals with paranoid delusions will have the tendency to take action based on their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bental and Taylor (2006), p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; More research is needed on the particular types of actions that are pursued based on paranoid delusions. Some researchers have made attempts to distinguish the different variations of actions brought on as a result of delusions. Wessely et al. (1993) did just this by studying individuals with delusions of which more than half had reportedly taken action or behaved as a result of these delusions. However, the overall actions were not of a violent nature in most of the informants. The authors note that other studies such as one by Taylor (1985), have shown that violent behaviors were more common in certain types of paranoid individuals, mainly those considered to be offensive such as prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Wessely et al. (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have found associations between childhood abusive behaviors and the appearance of violent behaviors in psychotic individuals. This could be a result of their inability to cope with aggression as well as other people, especially when constantly attending to potential threats in their environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bentall and Taylor(2006), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; The attention to threat itself has been proposed as one of the major contributors of violent actions in paranoid people, although there has been much deliberation about this as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bentall and Taylor (2006), p. 287-288&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have shown that there may only be certain types of delusions that promote any violent behaviors, persecutory delusions seem to be one of these.&lt;ref&gt;Bjorkly (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Having resentful emotions towards others and the inability to be able to understand what other people are feeling seem to have an association with violence in paranoid individuals. This was based on a study of paranoid schizophrenics' (one of the common mental disorders that exhibit paranoid symptoms) theories of mind capabilities in relation to empathy. The results of this study revealed specifically that although the violent patients were more successful at the higher level theory of mind tasks, they were not as able to interpret others' emotions or claims.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Akel and Abushua’leh (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paranoid social cognition==
Social psychological research has proposed a mild form of paranoid cognition, ''paranoid social cognition'', that has its origins in social determinants more than intra-psychic conflict.&lt;ref name=Fenigstein92&gt;Fenigstein, A., &amp; Vanable, P. A. (1992). Paranoia and self-consciousness. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 62'', 129 - 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kramer94&gt;Kramer, R. M. (1994). The sinister attribution error: Origins and consequences of collective paranoia. ''Motivation and Emotion, 18'', 199 - 230.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kramer95a&gt;Kramer, R. M. (1995a). In dubious battle: Heightened accountability, dysphoric cognition, and self-defeating bargaining behavior. In R. M. Kramer &amp; D. M. Messick (Eds.), ''Negotiation in its social context'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;95 – 120). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kramer95b&gt;Kramer, R. M. (1995b). Power, paranoia, and distrust in organizations: The distorted view from the top. ''Research on Negotiation in Organizations, 5'', 119 - 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zimbardo81&gt;Zimbardo, P. G., Andersen, S. M., &amp; Kabat, L. G. (1981). Induced hearing deficit generates experimental paranoia. ''Science, 212'', 1529 - 1531.&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective states that in milder forms, paranoid cognitions may be very common among normal individuals. For instance, it is not strange that people may exhibit in their daily life, self-centered thought such as they are being talked about, suspiciousness about other’ intentions, and assumptions of ill or hostility (i.e. people may feel as if everything is going against them). According to Kramer, (1998) these milder forms of paranoid cognition may be considered as an adaptive response to cope with or make sense of disturbing and threatening social environment.

Paranoid cognition captures the idea that dysphoric self-consciousness may be related with the position that people occupies within a social system. This self-consciousness conduces to a hypervigilant and ruminative mode to process social information that finally will stimulate a variety of paranoid-like forms of social misperception and misjudgment.&lt;ref name=Kramer98&gt;Kramer, R. M. (1998). Revisiting the Bay of Pigs and Vietnam decisions twenty-five years later: How well has the group think hypothesis stood the test of time? ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 73'', 236 - 271.&lt;/ref&gt;  This model identifies four components that are essential to understanding paranoid social cognition: situational antecedents, dysphoric self-consciousness, hypervigilance and rumination, and judgmental biases.

===Situational antecedents===
Perceived social distinctiveness, perceived evaluative scrutiny and uncertainty about the social standing.
*Perceived social distinctiveness: According to the [[social identity theory]],&lt;ref name=Turner87&gt;Turner, J. (1987). ''Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; people categorize themselves in terms of characteristics that made them unique or different from others under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=Cota86&gt;Cota, A. A., &amp; Dion, K. L. (1986). Salience of gender and sex composition of ad-hoc groups: An experimental test of distinctiveness theory. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50'', 770 - 776.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Turner87/&gt; Gender, ethnicity, age, or experience may become extremely relevant to explain people’s behavior when these attributes make them unique in a social group. This distinctive attribute may have influence not only in how people are perceived, but may also affect the way they perceive themselves. 
*Perceived evaluative scrutiny: According to this model, dysphoric self-consciousness may increase when people feel under moderate or intensive evaluative social scrutiny. For instance, when an asymmetric relationship is analyzed, as the relationship among a doctoral student and their advisors, students tend to remember more behaviors and events that they interpret as affecting their level of trust in the relationship compared to their advisors, suggesting that students are more willing to put attention to their advisor that the advisor are motivated to pay attention to them. Also students spent more time ruminating about the behaviors, events, and their relationship in general.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}
*Uncertainty about social standing: The knowledge about the social standing is another factor that may induce paranoid social cognition. Many researchers have argued that experiencing uncertainty about a social position in a social system constitutes an adverse psychological state, one which people are highly motivated to reduce.

===Dysphoric self-consciousness===
Refers to an aversive form of heightened 'public self-consciousness' characterized by the feelings that one is under intensive evaluation or [[scrutiny]].&lt;ref name=Kramer95a/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R. I., &amp; Galunic, D. C. (1996). Consequences of public scrutiny for leaders and their organizations. In B. M. Staw &amp; L. L. Cummings (Eds.), ''Research in organizational behavior'' (Vol. 18, pp. 201–250). Greenwich, CT: JAI.&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming self-tormenting will increase the odds of interpreting others' behaviors in a self-referential way.

===Hypervigilance and rumination===
Self-consciousness was characterized as an aversive psychological state. According to this model, people experiencing self-consciousness will be highly motivated to reduce it, trying to make sense of what they are experiencing. These attempts promote hypervigilance and rumination in a circular relationship: more hypervigilance generates more rumination, whereupon more rumination generates more hypervigilance. Hypervigilance can be thought of as a way to appraise threatening social information, but in contrast to adaptive vigilance, hypervigilance will produce elevated levels of arousal, fear, anxiety, and threat perception.&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, R. S., &amp; Folkman, S. (1984). ''Stress, appraisal, and coping''. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Rumination is another possible response to threatening social information. Rumination can be related to the paranoid social cognition because it can increase negative thinking about negative events, and evoke a pessimistic explanatory style.

===Judgmental biases===
Three main judgmental consequences have been identified:&lt;ref name=Kramer94/&gt;
*The sinister attribution error: This bias captures the tendency that social perceivers have to overattribute lack of trustworthiness to others.
*The overly personalistic construal of social interaction: Refers to the inclination that paranoid perceiver has to interpret others’  action in a disproportional self-referential way, increasing the belief that they are the target of others’ thoughts and actions. A special kind of bias in the biased punctuation of social interaction, which entail an overperception of causal linking among independent events.
*The exaggerated perception of conspiracy: Refers to the disposition that the paranoid perceiver has to overattribute social coherence and coordination to others’ actions.

'''Pen pals''' (or '''penpals''', '''pen-pals''', '''penfriends''' or '''pen friends''') are [[people]] who regularly write to each other, particularly via [[postal mail]].

==Purposes==
A penpal relationship is often used to practice reading and writing in a [[foreign language]], to improve [[literacy]], to learn more about other countries and life-styles, and to make friendships. As with any friendships in life, some people remain penpals for only a short time, while others continue to exchange letters and presents for life. Some penpals eventually arrange to meet face to face; sometimes leading to serious relationships, or even [[marriage]].

Penpals come in all ages, nationalities, cultures, languages and interests. Pals may seek new penfriends based on their own age group, a specific occupation, hobby, or select someone totally different from them to gain knowledge about the world around them.

A modern variation on the traditional penpal arrangement is to have a keypal / epal and exchange [[email]] addresses as well as or instead of paper letters. This has the advantage of saving money and being more immediate, allowing many messages to be exchanged in a short period of time. The disadvantage is that the communication can be very ephemeral if the email messages are not routinely saved. Many people prefer to receive paper letters, gaining the satisfaction of seeing their name carefully printed on a thick envelope in the letterbox.  Using [[postal mail]], it is possible to trade coupons, swap slips, [[postcard]]s, [[postage stamp|stamps]] and anything else light and flat enough to fit inside an envelope, often called "tuck-ins". Many penpallers like to trade sheets of stickers, notecards and stationery sets.

While the expansion of the [[Internet]] has reduced the number of traditional penpals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6133903/50-things-that-are-being-killed-by-the-internet.html|title=50 things that are being killed by the internet|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Matthew|last=Moore|date=4 September 2009|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; penpal clubs can nowadays be found on the Internet, in magazine columns, newspapers, and sometimes through clubs or special interest groups. Some people are looking for romantic interests, while others just want to find friends. It seems, on the internet, that the term "pen pals" defines those looking to correspond with others that live in a different place, where pen pals originated via postal mail correspondences and has evolved to mean something more. Penpals also make and pass around [[friendship book]]s, slams and crams. Another term used to describe pen pal is the word penfriend.

In recent years, pen pal correspondence with prison inmates has gained acceptance on the Internet.

==Organizations==
Many penpals meet each other through organizations that bring people together for this purpose.

Organizations can be split into three main categories: free, partial subscription, and subscription-based clubs. Free clubs are usually funded by advertising and profiles are not reviewed, whereas subscription-based clubs will usually not contain any advertising and will have an administrator approving profiles to the database.

While the traditional [[snail mail]] pen pal relationship has fallen into a decline due to modern technology closing the world's [[communication]] gap, prison pen pal services have combined technology with traditional letter writing. These sites allow [[prisoners]] to place pen pal ads online; however, inmates in the [[United States]] and most of the world are not permitted to access the Internet. Therefore the pen pal relationships with inmates are still conducted via postal mail. Other pen pal organizations have survived by embracing the technology of the Internet.

==In popular culture==
The [[Australia]]n author [[Geraldine Brooks (writer)|Geraldine Brooks]] wrote a [[memoir]] entitled ''Foreign Correspondence'' (1997) about her childhood, which was enriched by her exchanges of letters with other children in Australia and overseas and her travels as an adult in search of the people they had become.

In the 1970s, syndicated children's television program ''[[Big Blue Marble]]'' often invited viewers to write to them for their own pen pal.

On another children's TV show, ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', [[Pee-wee Herman]] would often receive pen pal letters.

At the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964/1965 World's Fair]] in New York, the [[Parker Pen]] pavilion provided a computer pen pal matching service. This service was officially terminated by Parker Pen in 1967. This service did not work in conjunction with any other pen friend clubs. The computer system and database used for this service were not sold, taken over, or continued in any way.

In the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip from the 1960s and 1970s, Charlie Brown tries to write to a pen pal using a fountain pen  but after several literally "botched" attempts, Charlie switches to using a pencil and referring to his penpal as his "pencil-pal", with his first letter to his "pencil-pal" explaining the reason for the name change.

The 1983 [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Romance (1983 film)|Romance]]'' is about two people, Amar (from India) and Sonia (from the UK) who fall in love after becoming pen pals. The 1999 Bollywood film ''[[Sirf Tum]]'' has a similar storyline.

The 1998 film ''[[You've Got Mail (film)|You've Got Mail]]'' is a romantic comedy about two people in a pen pal Email courtship who are unaware that they are also business rivals.

The 2004 action-drama film ''[[Out of Reach (film)|Out of Reach]]'' is about a pen pal relationship  between a Vietnam veteran and a 13-year-old orphaned girl from Poland. When the letters suddenly stop coming, he heads to Poland to find out the reason.

The 2009 [[claymation]] film ''[[Mary and Max]]'' is about the pen pal relationship between an American man and an Australian girl.

The 2012 novel ''[[Penpal (novel)|Penpal]]'' takes a dark twist to this innocent idea by the plot revolving around the protagonist being stalked ever since sending his letter.

The 2015 musical album ''Gold'' is a collaboration between musicians [[Jetty Rae]] and [[Heath McNease]] under the moniker "Pen Pals".

'''Personality judgment''' (or '''personality judgement''') is the process by which people perceive each other's personalities through acquisition of certain information about others, or meeting others in person. The purpose of studying personality judgment is to understand past behavior exhibited by individuals and predict future behavior. Theories concerning personality judgment focus on the accuracy of personality judgments and the effects of personality judgments on various aspects of social interactions.&lt;ref name="Funder1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Funder|first1=David C.|year=1995|title=On the accuracy of personality judgment: A realistic approach.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=102|issue=4|pages=652–670|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.102.4.652|issn=0033-295X|pmid=7480467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining how people judge personality is important because personality judgments often influence individuals' behaviors.&lt;ref name="SnyderKlein2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snyder|first1=Mark|last2=Klein|first2=Olivier|title=Construing and constructing others: On the reality and the generality of the behavioral confirmation scenario|journal=Interaction Studies|volume=6|issue=1|year=2005|pages=53–67|issn=1572-0373|doi=10.1075/is.6.1.05sny}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Accuracy==

===Perspectives on accuracy===

Research on the accuracy of personality judgments varies based on three major perspectives on the basis of accurate personality judgment.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Funder | first1 = D. C. | last2 = West | first2 = S. G. | year = 1993 | title = Consensus, self-other agreement, and accuracy in personality judgment: An introduction | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 61 | issue = 4| pages = 457–476 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1993.tb00778.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; These perspectives vary based on the criteria used to determine accuracy.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt;
 
*Pragmatism: The pragmatic perspective on accuracy suggests that people will only perceive aspects of personality that they can use when interacting with others.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt; The personality judgments are deemed accurate when they are useful in future interactions.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt;
*Constructivism: The constructivist perspective on accuracy suggests that there is no objective, accurate measure of personality judgment.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt; People may make differing personality judgments of the same person based on their unique perspectives of the judged person.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt; According to constructivists, each judgment is equally correct. Thus, rather than focusing on accuracy of judgments, these researchers focus on the different methods and perspectives through which people make personality judgments.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt; 
*Realism: The realistic perspective on personality judgment assumes that there is an objective reality in personality that can be measured empirically.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt; Realists believe that personality judgments may be verified for accuracy by determining whether the judgments predict the target individual's behaviors.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt; Accuracy may also be verified by agreement of personality judgments among several independent judges.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt;

===Contributors to accurate personality judgment===
A variety of variables contribute to the accuracy or inaccuracy of personality judgment in systematic ways. These variables include characteristics of the individual whose [[personality]] is being judged as well as characteristics of the individual who is judging personality.&lt;ref&gt;Funder, D.C. (2010). The personality puzzle. New York: W.W. Norton and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judge characteristics====
Characteristics of the individual judging personality that contribute to accuracy include the following:
*[[Gender]] and ethnic similarity to target&lt;ref name="Letzring"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Letzring | first1 = T. D. | year = 2010 | title = The effects of judge-target gender and ethnicity similarity on the accuracy of personality judgments | url = | journal = Social Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 42–51 | doi = 10.1027/1864-9335/a000007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**A person is more likely to make an accurate personality judgment when the individual they are judging has the same gender and ethnicity as the judge.&lt;ref name="Letzring"/&gt;
*[[Stereotype]] knowledge and utilization,&lt;ref name="Chan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chan | first1 = W. | last2 = Mendelsohn | first2 = G. A. | year = 2010 | title = Disentangling stereotype and person effects: Do social stereotypes bias observer judgment of personality? . | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 251–257 | doi = 10.1016/j.jrp.2010.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
**When judges are only aware of the target's group membership, judges are likely to base personality judgments on their knowledge of stereotypes concerning the relevant group.&lt;ref name="Chan"/&gt; However, these effects are much stronger for gender stereotypes than ethnic stereotypes, such that even when abundant information about the target is available, judges will base personality judgment on gender stereotypes but not ethnic stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Chan"/&gt; 
*Relationship to the target individual &lt;ref name="Connelly"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Connelly | first1 = B. S. | last2 = Ones | first2 = D. S. | year = 2010 | title = An other perspective on personality: Meta-analytic integration of observers' accuracy and predictive validity | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 136 | issue = 6| pages = 1092–1122 | doi = 10.1037/a0021212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Judges who are acquainted with the target individual typically provide more accurate personality judgments, presumably due to their knowledge of the individual across different types of situations.&lt;ref name="Connelly"/&gt;
*Number of judges&lt;ref name="Connelly"/&gt;
**Although one judge may provide an accurate personality judgment, the average of multiple judgments from different individuals more strongly predicts behavior than judgments from one individual.&lt;ref name="Connelly"/&gt;
*Sex of the judge&lt;ref name="Letzring"/&gt;
**Females typically provide more accurate personality judgments than males.&lt;ref name="Letzring"/&gt;

====Target characteristics====
Characteristics of the target individual that are important for accurate personality judgment include the following:
*Visibility of the [[trait theory|trait]] in question&lt;ref name="FunderDobroth1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Funder|first1=David C.|last2=Dobroth|first2=Kathryn M.|title=Differences between traits: Properties associated with interjudge agreement.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=52|issue=2|year=1987|pages=409–418|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.2.409}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Traits that are more readily observable are more likely to elicit accurate judgments.&lt;ref name="FunderDobroth1987"/&gt; [[Extraversion]] is typically considered a more visible trait, whereas [[neuroticism]] is considered a less visible trait.&lt;ref name="FunderDobroth1987"/&gt; 
*Psychological adjustment of the target individual&lt;ref name="HumanBiesanz2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Human|first1=Lauren J.|last2=Biesanz|first2=Jeremy C.|title=Target adjustment and self-other agreement: Utilizing trait observability to disentangle judgeability and self-knowledge.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=101|issue=1|year=2011|pages=202–216|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/a0023782|pmid=21604892}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
**Individuals who are well-adjusted are more likely to elicit accurate personality judgments.&lt;ref name="HumanBiesanz2011"/&gt; Well-adjusted individuals reveal more about their personality to those they interact with, thus making it easier for others to judge them accurately.&lt;ref name="HumanBiesanz2011"/&gt;

==Effects on behavior==
Personality judgment not only influences perceptions of individuals, it also may influence the behavior of individuals being judged. This phenomenon is known as [[behavioural confirmation|behavioral confirmation]], and occurs when one's preconceived ideas about a person influence the behavior of the person. For example, if an individual is believed to be aggressive, one's behavior toward that individual may elicit an aggressive response, even if the individual is not typically aggressive.&lt;ref name="SnyderKlein2005"/&gt; Behavioral confirmation may occur in a variety of settings, including classrooms and social interactions. Researchers have shown that when a male individual believes he is talking to an attractive woman over the phone, the woman will act more sociable and agreeable than if the male believes he is talking to an unattractive woman.&lt;ref name="Tanke"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Snyder | first1 = M. | last2 = Tanke | first2 = E. D. | last3 = Berscheid | first3 = E. | year = 1977 | title = Social perception and interpersonal behavior: On the self-fulfilling nature of social stereotypes | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 35 | issue = 9| pages = 656–666 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.35.9.656 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the woman's behavior in this situation is being influenced by the male's expectations concerning her appearance, rather than her actual personality characteristics.&lt;ref name="Tanke"/&gt;

==Cultural influences==

An additional determinant of the processes through which personality is judged and the accuracy of these judgments is [[culture]]. Typically, researchers report cross-cultural consistency in the judgment of personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Albright | first1 = L. | last2 = Malloy | first2 = T. E. | last3 = Dong | first3 = Q. | last4 = Kenny | first4 = D. A. | last5 = Fang | first5 = X. | year = 1997 | title = Cross-cultural consensus in personality judgments | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 72 | issue = 3| pages = 558–569 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.72.3.558 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, people from different types of cultures tend to find certain traits more easily identifiable than others, based on judging personality from facial characteristics of targets alone.&lt;ref name="WalkerJiang2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=M.|last2=Jiang|first2=F.|last3=Vetter|first3=T.|last4=Sczesny|first4=S.|title=Universals and Cultural Differences in Forming Personality Trait Judgments From Faces|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|volume=2|issue=6|year=2011|pages=609–617|issn=1948-5506|doi=10.1177/1948550611402519}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, people from Western cultures are typically better able to identify the traits of [[extroversion]] and [[aggression]] than individuals from Eastern cultures.&lt;ref name="WalkerJiang2011"/&gt;

{{Contract law}}
The '''posting rule''' (or '''mailbox rule''' in the United States, also known as the "postal rule" or "deposited acceptance rule") is an exception to the general rule of [[contract law]] in [[common law]] countries that [[offer and acceptance|acceptance of an offer]] takes place when communicated.  Under the posting rule, that acceptance takes effect when a letter is posted (that is, dropped in a [[post box]] or handed to a postal worker).&lt;ref&gt;The post office will be the [[universal service]] provider, such as the [[Royal Mail]] or [[Australia Post]] or [[United States Postal Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[plain English]], the "meeting of the minds" necessary to contract formation occurs at the exact moment word of acceptance is ''sent'' via post by the person accepting it, rather than when that acceptance is ''received'' by the person who offered the contract.

The rules of contracts by post (postal rules) include the following:
# An offer made by post/letter is not effective until received by the offeree.
# Acceptance is effective as soon as it is posted.
# For revocation to be effective, it must be received by the offeree before they post their letter of acceptance.

One rationale given for the rule is that the offeror nominates the post office as his or her implied agent, and thus receipt of the acceptance by the post office is regarded as receipt by the offeror. The main effect of the posting rule is that the risk of acceptance being delivered late or lost in the post is placed upon the offeror. If the offeror is reluctant to accept this risk, he can always expressly require actual receipt as a condition before being legally bound by his offer.

==English case law==

The rule was established by a series of 19th century cases, starting with ''[[Adams v Lindsell]]'' (1818) B &amp; Ald 681, which was later confirmed and expanded in ''[[Dunlop v Higgins]]'' (1848) 1 HL Cas 381, ''[[Household Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Co Ltd v Grant]]'' (1879) 4 Ex D 216 and ''[[Henthorn v Fraser]]'' [1892] 2 Ch 27.

The posting rule applies only to acceptance.  Other contractual letters (such as one revoking the offer) do not take effect until the letter is delivered, as in ''[[Stevenson, Jacques &amp; Co v McLean]]'' (1880) 5 QBD 346. The implication of this is that it is possible for a letter of acceptance to be posted after a letter of revocation of the offer has been posted but before it is delivered, and acceptance will be complete at the time that the letter of acceptance was posted—the offeror's revocation would be inoperative.

Example 1:
* Day 1: A makes an offer to B.
* Day 2: A decides to revoke the offer and puts a letter in the mail to B revoking the offer.
* Day 3: B puts a letter accepting the offer in the mail. 
* Day 4: B receives A's revocation letter.
:* The letter of revocation can be effective only when received, that is Day 4.
:* However, a contract was formed on Day 3 when the letter of acceptance was posted.
:* It is too late for A to revoke the offer.

Example 2:
* Day 1: A makes an offer to B.
* Day 2: B intends to ''reject'' the offer by putting a letter in the mail to A rejecting the offer. 
* Day 3: B changes his mind and sends a [[fax]] to A accepting the offer.
:* In this situation, whichever communication A receives first will govern.

Example 3:
* Day 1: A makes an offer to sell a parcel of land to B.
* Day 2: B mails her acceptance.
* Day 3: Before A receives B's acceptance, B telephones A and states she wishes to reject the offer.
* Day 4: B's original letter of acceptance arrives, A then records the contract as a sale.
:* B's acceptance of the offer means there is a binding contract -- she is obliged to pay for the land or be liable for damages.
:* B is just rejecting the offer, she did not actually revoke her acceptance

Under the posting rule, performance is a means of acceptance. If A orders 1000 blue coathangers and B ships them out, that shipment is considered to be a conveyance of acceptance of A's offer to buy the coathangers. Defective performance is also an acceptance, unless accompanied by an explanation. For example, if A orders 1000 blue coathangers, and B mistakenly ships 1000 red coathangers, this is still an acceptance of the contract. However, if B ships the red coathangers with a note that they sent these because they had run out of blue coathangers, this is not an acceptance, but rather an [[Accommodation (law)|accommodation]], which is a form of [[counter-offer]].

An interesting implication of the operation of the posting rule is that an acceptance is complete once the letter of acceptance is posted; it makes no difference whether the offeror actually receives the letter. This was demonstrated in ''[[Byrne v Van Tienhoven]]'' (1880) 5 CPD 344. If a letter of acceptance were to be lost, acceptance has still taken place.  An exception to this would be if the [[offeree]] knows or has reason to know that the letter of acceptance never reached the [[offeror]]. For example, if A brings a letter of acceptance to the local post office and A sees the post office burn down a moment later, there is no acceptance.

Further the posting rule does not apply to instantaneous forms of communications.  For example, in ''[[Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation]]'' [1955] 2 QB 327, the Court held that the posting rule did not apply to an acceptance by [[telex]] as the Court regarded it as an instantaneous form of communication. The general principle that acceptance takes place when communicated applies to instantaneous forms of communication. Courts have similarly held that the posting rule does apply to acceptances by [[telephone]] or [[fax]]. 

The courts are yet to decide whether [[e-mail]] should be regarded as an instantaneous form of communication. If the offeree were to convey acceptance by commercially ''un''reasonable means - by cross-country [[pony express]], for example - the acceptance would not be effective until it had actually been received.

A letter is regarded as "posted" only when it is in the possession of the [[Post Office]]; this was established in the case of ''[[Re London &amp; Northern Bank]]'' [1900] 1 Ch 220. A letter of acceptance is not considered "posted" if it is handed to an agent to deliver, such as a courier. This is not the case under the Uniform Commercial Code.

The posting rule does '''not''' apply to option contracts or irrevocable offers where acceptance is still effective only upon receipt. This is because the offeree no longer needs protection against subsequently mailed revocations of the offer.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Where parties are at distance from one another, and an offer is sent by mail, it is universally held in this country [United States] that the reply accepting the offer may be sent through the same medium, and, if it is so sent, the contract will be complete when the acceptance is mailed,...and beyond the acceptor's control; the theory being that, when one makes an offer through the mail, he authorizes the acceptance to be made through the same medium his agent to receive his acceptance; that the acceptance, when mailed, is then constructively communicated to the offeror.

–Excerpt of an opinion by Judge Kimmelman (718 A.2d 1223)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==American case law==

In the United States, the majority rule is that the mailbox rule does not apply to [[option contracts]].  By default, an option contract is accepted when the offeror receives the acceptance, not when the offeree mails it.  However, because the [[California Civil Code]] applies the mailbox rule to all contracts, California follows the minority rule, under which the mailbox rule also applies to [[option contract]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3879211402999684820 ''Palo Alto Town &amp; Country Village, Inc. v. BBTC Company''], 11 Cal. 3d 494, 113 Cal. Rptr. 705, 521 P.2d 1097 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian case law==
In ''Tallerman &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Nathan's Merchandise'' (1957) 98 CLR 93, 111-112&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studymode.com/essays/Tallerman-Co-Pty-Ltd-v-135644.html Tallerman &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Nathan's Merchandise'' (1957) 98 CLR 93]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Dixon|Dixon CJ]] and Fullagar J took a more restrictive view. "The general rule is that a contract is not completed until acceptance of an offer is actually communicated to the offeror, and a finding that a contract is completed by the posting of a letter of acceptance cannot be justified unless it is to be inferred that the offeror contemplated and intended that his offer might be accepted by the doing of that act." The High Court included the element of intention.

==Civil law jurisdictions==
Civil law jurisdictions do not follow the postal rule. The classical civil law position is that acceptance, like any expression of will, can only be effective if it was communicated to the addressee, unless the lack of communication can be attributed to the latter.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Article 3:37 of the [[Dutch Civil Code]], Article 130 of the [[German Civil Code]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods|The Vienna Convention on the International Sale of Goods]] chooses a compromise between the two approaches: According to article 18(2) of the Convention, an acceptance is effective when it reaches the offeror. However, article 16(1) of the Convention provides for the most important consequence of the common law "posting rule", that is, an offer may not be revoked if the revocation reaches the offeree after it has dispatched an acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;See Articles 18 and 16(1) of the Vienna Convention&lt;/ref&gt;

==UNCITRAL model law==
{{main|United Nations Commission on International Trade Law}}
Many countries have enacted legislation based on the UNCITRAL Model Law of Electronic Commerce.  Such legislation is often entitled the Electronic Transactions Act.  Among other issues, this legislation deals a default rule for the time that email (electronic communications) is sent and when it is received.  However it is mistaken to suggest that it deals with a clarification of the postal acceptance rule for electronic communications. There are two schools of thought.

# Ask if the postal acceptance rule applies to emails (electronic communications). If your answer is yes, then the relevant Electronic Transaction Act (ETA) can help. The postal acceptance rule states that there is a contract when posted – so we should apply the "sent" rule under the ETA. If the answer is no; then either apply the "received" rule under the ETA or ignore it and use the contract rule of communication.
# Instead, treat the Electronic Transactions Act as an intended substitute and statutory replacement of the postal acceptance rule; in which case the "received" rule should apply. The problem with this second school of thought is that there is nothing in the Model Law of Electronic Commerce, nor the ETAs which suggests that it was intended to replace the postal acceptance rule. We are still waiting for a court to decide.

The UNCITRAL rules on time of sending and receiving are:
# Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the dispatch of a data message occurs when it enters an information system outside the control of the originator or of the person who sent the data message on behalf of the originator.
#  Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the time of receipt of a data message is determined as follows:
:: (a) if the addressee has designated an information system for the purpose of receiving data messages, receipt occurs:
::: (i) at the time when the data message enters the designated information system; or
::: (ii) if the data message is sent to an information system of the addressee that is not the designated information system, at the time when the data message is retrieved by the addressee;
:: (b) if the addressee has not designated an information system, receipt occurs when the data message enters an information system of the addressee.

[[File:Pdm cover.jpg|thumb|right]]
The '''''Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual''''' ('''PDM''') is a diagnostic handbook similar to the [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD) or the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM). The PDM was published on May 28, 2006.

The information contained in the PDM was collected by a collaborative task force which includes members of the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]], the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]], the Division of Psychoanalysis (Division 39) of the [[American Psychological Association]], the [[American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry]], and the National Membership Committee on Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work.

Although it is based on current neuroscience and treatment outcome studies, Carey (2006) points out that many of the concepts in the PDM are adapted from the classical [[psychoanalytic]] tradition of psychotherapy. For example, the PDM indicates that the [[anxiety disorders]] may be traced to the "four basic danger situations" described by [[Sigmund Freud]] (1926)&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;{{cite book|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|title=The Collected Works of Sigmund Freud|year=1926|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=Vol 20|edition=Standard|chapter=Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as the loss of a significant other; the loss of love; the loss of body integrity; and the loss of affirmation by one's own conscience.&lt;ref name=Carey&gt;{{cite news|last=Carey|first=Benedict|title=For Therapy, a New Guide With a Touch of Personality|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a new perspective on the existing diagnostic system as it enables clinicians to describe and categorize personality patterns, related social and emotional capacities, unique mental profiles, and personal experiences of the patient.&lt;ref name=Etnyre&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etnyre|first=W|title=Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual|journal=Journal of Clinical Social Work|year=2008|volume=36|pages=403–406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PDM is not intended to compete with the DSM or ICD. The authors report the work emphasizes "individual variations as well as commonalities" by "focusing on the full range of mental functioning" and serves as a "[complement to] the DSM and ICD efforts in cataloguing [sic] symptoms.&lt;ref name="HomePage"&gt;{{cite web|last=PDM Task Force|title=Home Page|url=http://www.pdm1.org/index.htm|publisher=Alliance of Psychoanalytic Organizations|accessdate=9 January 2013|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The task force intends for the PDM to augment the existing diagnostic taxonomies by providing "a multi dimensional approach to describe the intricacies of the patient's overall functioning and ways of engaging in the therapeutic process.".&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite web|last=PDM Task Force|title=Introduction|url=http://www.pdm1.org/intro.htm|publisher=Alliance of Psychoanalytic Organizations|accessdate=9 January 2013|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxonomy ==

=== Dimension I: Personality Patterns and Disorders ===

This first dimension classifies personality patterns in two domains.  First, it looks at the spectrum of personality types and places the person's personality on a continuum from unhealthy and maladaptive to healthy and adaptive. Second, it classifies the how the person "organizes mental functioning and engages the world".&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;

The task force adds, "This dimension has been placed first in the PDM system because of the accumulating evidence that symptoms or problems cannot be understood, assessed, or treated in the absence of an understanding of the mental life of the person who has the symptoms".&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;  In other words, a list of symptoms characteristic of a diagnosis does not adequately inform a clinician how to understand and treat the symptoms without proper context.  By analogy, if a patient went to her physician complaining of watering eyes and a runny nose, the symptoms alone do not indicate the appropriate treatment.  Her symptoms could be a function of seasonal allergies, a bacterial sinus infection, the common cold, or she may have just come from her grandmother's funeral.  The doctor might treat allergies with an antihisamine, the sinus infection with antibiotics, the cold with zinc, and give her patient a Kleenex tissue after the funeral.  All four conditions may have very similar symptoms; all four condition are treated very differently.

=== Dimension II: Mental Functioning ===
Next, the PDM provides a "detailed description of emotional functioning" which are understood to be "the capacities that contribute to an individual's personality and overall level of psychological health or pathology".&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;  This dimension provides a "microscopic" examination of the patient's mental life by systematically accounting for their functional capacity to
* Process information
* Self-regulate
* Establish and maintain relationships
* Experience, organize, and express feelings and emotions at different levels
* Represent, differentiate, and integrate experience
* Utilize appropriate coping strategies and defense mechanisms
* Accurately observe oneself and others
* Form internal values and standards

=== Dimension III: Manifest Symptoms and Concerns ===

The third dimension starts with the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic categories; moreover, beyond simply listing symptoms, the PDM "goes on to describe the affective states, cognitive processes, somatic experiences, and relational patterns most often associated clinically" with each diagnosis.&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;  In this dimension, "symptom clusters" are "useful descriptors" which presents the patient's "symptom patterns in terms of the patient's personal experience of his or her prevailing difficulties".&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;  The task force concludes, "The patient may evidence a few or many patterns, which may or may not be related, and which should be seen in the context of the person's personality and mental functioning.  The multi dimensional approach... provides a systematic way to describe patients that is faithful to their complexity and helpful in planning appropriate treatments".&lt;ref name="HomePage" /&gt;

== The new edition (PDM-2) ==
Guilford Press will be publishing a new edition of the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM-2), which is being developed by a steering committee composed by [[Vittorio Lingiardi]] (Editor), [[Nancy McWilliams]] (Editor), and [[Robert S. Wallerstein]] (Honorary Chair). Guilford Press received a manuscript for PDM-2 in September 2016, and the current release date is set for June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Guilford Press Customer Service&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''robotoid''' is an "[[artificial lifeform]]" that is created through processes that are totally different from [[cloning]] or synthetics.&lt;ref name="beter"&gt;[http://www.peterdavidbeter.com/docs/all/dbal46.html ''Dr. Peter David Beter's Audio Letter #46''], [[Peter Beter]], May 28, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; In short; the cybernetic equivalent of a "[[humanoid]]."

Perhaps the first mention of "robotoid" was in the ''[[Lost in Space]]'' episode ''War of the Robots'' which originally aired on February 9, 1966 and credits [[Robby the Robot]] as a "robotoid" and [[William Bramley]] and [[Ollie O'Toole]] as uncredited "robotoid voice" actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0636256|"Lost in Space" War of the Robots (1966)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, the ''Lost in Space'' robot says: "It is more than a machine...it is a robotoid." The robot goes on to explain that as a robot, it is constrained by its programming, whereas the robotoid has the capability of making a [[choice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irwinallenmemories.com/lis/Show/episodes/Season_One/warofrobots/ ''War of the Robots'' review by Barney Stater]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/discussions/start-thread.html?ASIN=630494666X&amp;authorID=A229BB802RIOZ1&amp;reviewID=RXJK9VAT370UI Amazon.com review of "Lost in Space Gift Set (vol. 7-9)"]&lt;/ref&gt; The episode is described as: "The family's robot is seemingly replaced when Will repairs a robotoid from an advanced civilization - until the new machine wreaks havoc by trying to take over the ship."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxmovies.com.au/dvd/lost-in-space-season-1-412/412/ 20th Century Fox Movies: Lost in Space Season 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Piers Anthony]]'s short story ''Getting Through University'', which may have been published as early as 1967/1968 in the science fiction magazine ''[[Worlds of If]]'', mentions a robotoid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piers-anthony.com/prosthoplus.html The Complete Piers Anthony: ''Prosthy Plus'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1968, [[Marvel Comics]] released [[Bibliography of Avengers titles|Avengers #51]] which introduced "The Robotoid".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/robotoidcollector.htm The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Character Profile: ''The Robotoid''], compiled by Jeff Christiansen&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, 1978, the [[Battle of the Planets]] TV series episode ''Rage of the Robotoids'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/39876-Rage_of_the_Robotoids.html Big Cartoon Database: ''Rage of the Robotoids'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Peter Beter]] in his May 28, 1979 ''Dr. Peter David Better Audio Letter'' #46 series of [[audiobook]]s, [[organic life|organic]] robotoid technology is being made to make nearly exact copies of important people. One organization that allegedly uses such classified technology is the [[Illuminati]]. Robotoids are "manufactured" first by copying the [[memory]] of an entire [[brain]]. A [[holographic]] image is made of the host’s brain and that is transferred into the biological matter functioning as a brain of the robotoid, but adjustments have to be taught and [[computer programming|programmed]] into the mind of the robotoid since the body and brain of the robotoid are not identical to the original person being copied.&lt;ref name="beter"/&gt;

The '''ruwenzori colobus''' (''Colobus angolensis ruwenzori'')&lt;ref name="Colobus"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rwanda|url=https://books.google.al/books?id=NVTLZ41XyX8C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=Ruwenzori+colobus&amp;hl=sq&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCnKbspb3eAhXDCewKHXbCA6gQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ruwenzori%20colobus&amp;f=false|author1=Philip Briggs|author2=Janice Booth|ISBN=978-1-84162-306-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Ruwenzori black-and-white colobus''', is a [[primate]] [[subspecies]] of [[Angola colobus]], native to [[Rwanda]] at [[Nyungwe National Park]].&lt;ref name=""pp1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nyungwepark.com/nyungwe/the-park/|title=Nyungwe Forest|accessdate=21 April 2013|publisher=Official website of Nyungwe National Park.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
[[Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg|Adolf Friedrichs]] recognized the validity of subspecies as ''Colobus angolensis ruwenzori''.&lt;ref name="Colobus"/&gt;&lt;ref name=msw3&gt;{{MSW3 Groves|pages=168|id=12100598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Like all [[black-and-white colobus]], the ruwenzori colobus has black fur and a black face, surrounded by long, white locks of hair. It also has a mantle of white hair on the shoulders. The long, thin tail can be either black or white, but the tip is always white. There is a significant regional variation in the total amount of white on the body and the length of the fur.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Ecology and behavior==
The ruwenzori colobus is a highly arboreal and acrobatic leaf-eater.&lt;ref name="Colobus"/&gt; Their diet consists of about two thirds of leaves and one third of fruit and seeds.

Although all ''[[Colobus]]'' [[species]] are very sociable, they usually move on the troops of several hundred [[animal]]s.&lt;ref name="Colobus"/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The ruwenzori colobus inhabit [[rainforest]]s of Nyungwe National Park near [[Rwenzori Mountains]].&lt;ref name="Colobus"/&gt; Some reports indicate that the subspecies may occur in some [[Tanzania]]n [[region]]s.&lt;ref name="AndersonCowlishawRowcliffe2007"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Anderson |first1=J. |last2=Cowlishaw |first2=G. |last3=Rowcliffe |first3=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3300">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory of [[category (mathematics)|categories]], a '''sketch''' is a category ''D'', together with a set of [[cone (category theory)|cone]]s intended to be limits and a set of cocones intended to be colimits.  A '''model''' of the sketch in a category ''C'' is a [[functor]]
:&lt;math&gt;M:D\rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; 
that takes each specified cone to a limit cone in ''C'' and each specified cocone to a colimit cocone in ''C''.  Morphisms of models are [[natural transformation]]s.  Sketches are a general way of specifying structures on the objects of a category, forming a category-theoretic analog to the logical concept of a [[Theory_(mathematical_logic)|theory]] and its [[Model_theory|models]]. They allow multisorted models and models in any category.

Sketches were invented in 1968 by [[Charles Ehresmann]], using a different but equivalent definition.  There are still other definitions in the research literature.

  {{Feminism sidebar}}
In [[sociology]], a '''superwoman''' (also sometimes called '''supermom''') is a [[Western culture|Western woman]] who works hard to manage multiple roles of a worker, a [[homemaker]], a volunteer, a student, or other such time-intensive occupations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|title=Girls Constructing Identity and Transforming "femininity": Intersections Between Empirical and Theoretical Understandings of 21st Century Girlhood|author=Jessica Laureltree Willis|publisher=ProQuest|year=2008|isbn=0549870911}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The notion of "superwoman" differs from that of "[[career woman]]" in that the latter one commonly includes sacrifice of the family life in favor of career, while a superwoman strives to excel in both.&lt;ref name= serrin/&gt;

The term was also used in a somewhat similar context in the [[Stevie Wonder]] song "[[Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You)|Superwoman]]", released 1972. It was the title of a 1975 book by [[Shirley Conran]]; she also wrote ''Superwoman 2'' (1977); ''Superwoman in Action'' (1979); and ''Down with Superwoman: for everyone who hates housework'' (1990).

A number of other terms are derived from "superwoman", such as '''superwoman syndrome''',&lt;ref name=shaevitz/&gt; '''superwoman squeeze''' (a pressure on a superwoman to perform well in her multiple roles),&lt;ref&gt;"The Superwoman Squeeze", ''[[Newsweek]]", May 19, 1980, pp. 72–79&lt;/ref&gt; and '''superwoman complex''' (an expectation of a superwoman that she can and should do everything).&lt;ref name= serrin&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HsMPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3IwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7025,3342599&amp;dq=superwoman-complex&amp;hl=en "Superwoman Complex A Pain In The Ego"], by Judith Serrin, ''[[Boca Raton News]]'', July 28, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz entitled her book ''The Superwoman Syndrome'' in 1984.&lt;ref name=shaevitz&gt;"The superwoman syndrome", by Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz, Morton H.

== Post second-wave feminism ==
{{See also|Second-wave feminism}}
The notion was first recognized in the post [[second-wave feminism]] [[United States|American]] society of 1970s–1980s, with the shift of the woman's traditional role of a [[housewife]] towards a more career-oriented way of life. This life involved the pursuit of both traditional female roles in the home and with [[children]], as well as the pursuit of traditionally [[masculine]] goals in the form of jobs and public [[social status]].

[[Betty Friedan]], an American [[feminist]], in her book ''[[The Second Stage]]'' argued that "superwomanhood" of the 1980s has led to double enslavement of women, both at home and at work. Her advice for feminists was to step up to the "second stage" of the feminist movement and to struggle for reshaping both [[gender role]]s and redefining social values, styles, and institutional structures, for the fulfillment to be achievable in both public and private lives without the necessity to sacrifice one for another.&lt;ref&gt;''Feminist Thought: a more comprehensive introduction'', by Rosemarie Tong, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8133-3295-8}}, pp. 27, 28 (a summary of Friedan's position from ''The Second Stage'')&lt;/ref&gt;

A play-off structure involving the top five teams was used to determine the winners of the [[Super League]] competition in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[rugby league]] from 1998 until 2001. A [[Top six play-offs|top six play-off]] system was then introduced. Apart from the Grand Final all matches are staged at the home ground of the team placed higher in the final league table.

The same system was used in the [[New South Wales Rugby League|NSWRL]]'s Sydney Competition 1973–1994, the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] in its only season 1997, the [[Australian Football League|VFL]], 1972–1990 and [[New Zealand Rugby League|New Zealand's]] [[Lion Red Cup]], 1994–1996, and [[Bartercard Cup]], 2000–2006.

From week two on the Top five play-offs system reflects exactly the [[Page playoff system]].

==How it works==
'''Week One'''

* Qualification Final: 2nd vs 3rd
* Elimination Final: 4th vs 5th
* Bye: 1st

'''Week Two'''

* Major Semi Final: 1st vs Winners of Qualification Final
* Minor Semi Final: Losers of Qualification Final vs Winners of Elimination Final

'''Week Three'''

* Preliminary Final: Losers of Major Semi Final vs Winners of Minor Semi Final
* Bye: Winners of Major Semi Final

'''Week Four'''

* Grand Final: Winners of Major Semi Final vs Winners of Preliminary Final

This is considered a good playoff system, as while it allows fifth place to take part, it is incredibly difficult for them to be crowned champions as they must beat every team from above them at some point.

The only NSWRL team to win the premiership from 5th was Brisbane in 1993.

In elite Australian Rules Football, the only team to win from fifth under this system was Norwood in the SANFL in 1984. No AFL/VFL team won from fifth under this format (1972&amp;ndash;1990), and no WAFL team has won under this format as of 2016.

If all matches have the same odds to win, then Seed 1 has 37.5% to be champion; Seed 2 and 3 have 25% to be champion; Seed 4 and 5 have 6.25%

Seed 1 has two chances to reach the final, and only needs to win 1 match to clinch it. It is only eliminated before the final if loses against both finalists, and doesn´t win any match

Seed 2 and 3 need to win 2 out of 3 matches to reach the final (they are like in a best-of-3 semi-final, but with different opponents in any round)

Seed 4 and 5 need to win all other 4 opponents without loss to be crowned. Any loss means its elimination

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9272">The '''unity of opposites''' is the central category of [[dialectic]]s, said to be related to the notion of [[non-duality]] in a deep sense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thetempleofnature.org/_dox/unity-of-opposites-dialectic.pdf "The Unity of Opposites: A Dialectical Principle (PDF)"], V.T.JMcGill and W.T. Parry, ''Science &amp; Society'', vol. 12 no. 4 (Fall 1948), pp.418-444]&lt;/ref&gt; It defines a situation in which the existence or identity of a thing (or situation) depends on the co-existence of at least two conditions which are opposite to each other, yet dependent on each other and presupposing each other, within a field of tension. 

==Ancient philosophy==
First suggested by [[Heraclitus]] (c. 535 – c. 475 BC), a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[Greeks|Greek]] [[philosopher]], philosophers had for some time been contemplating the notion of opposites. [[Anaximander]] posited that every element was an opposite, or connected to an opposite (water is cold, fire is hot). Thus,  the material world was composed by some indefinite, boundless [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]] from which arose the [[classical element|elements]] (earth, air, fire, water) and pairs of opposites (hot/cold, wet/dry). There was, according to Anaximander, a continual war of opposites.

[[Anaximenes of Miletus]], a student and successor of Anaximander, replaced this indefinite, boundless [[arche]] with air, a known element with neutral properties. According to Anaximenes, there was not so much a war of opposites, as a continuum of change.

Heraclitus, however, did not accept the [[Milesians (Greek)|milesian]] [[monism]] and replaced their underlying material arche with a single, divine law of the universe, which he called [[Logos]]. The universe of Heraclitus is in constant change, but also remaining the same. That is to say, an object moves from point A to point B, thus creating a change, but the underlying law remains the same. Thus, a unity of opposites is present in the universe as difference and sameness. This is a rather broad example though. For a more detailed example we may turn to an [[aphorism]] of [[Heraclitus]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The road up and the road down are the same thing. ([[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], ''Refutations'' 9.10.3)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is an example of a [[wikt:compresence|compresent]] unity of opposites. For, at the same time, this slanted road has the opposite qualities of ascent and descent.  According to Heraclitus, everything is in constant flux, and every changing object co-instantiates at least one pair of opposites (though not necessarily simultaneously) and every pair of opposites is co-instantiated in at least one object. 

Heraclitus also uses the succession of opposites as a base for change:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cold things grow hot, a hot thing cold, a moist thing withers, a parched thing is wetted. ([[Diels–Kranz|DK]] B126)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a single object persists through opposite properties, this object undergoes change.

==Modern philosophy==
Dialecticians claim that unity or identity of opposites can exist in reality or in thought. If the opposites were completely balanced, the result would be [[Stability theory|stasis]], but often it is implied that one of the pairs of opposites is larger, stronger or more powerful than the other, such that over time, one of the opposed conditions prevails over the other. Yet rather than 'stasis' the identity of opposites, there being unity within their duality, is taken to be the instance of their very manifestation, the unity between them being the essential principle of making any particular opposite in question extant as either opposing force. For example 'upward' cannot exist unless there is a 'downward', they are opposites but they co-substantiate one another, their unity is that either one exists because the opposite is necessary for the existence of the other, one manifests immediately with the other. Hot would not be hot without cold, due to there being no contrast by which to define it as 'hot' relative to any other condition, it would not and could not have identity whatsoever if not for its very opposite that makes the necessary prerequisite existence for the opposing condition to be. This is the oneness, unity, principle to the very existence of any opposite. Either one's identity is the contra-posing principle itself, necessitating the other. The criteria for what is opposite is therefore something ''a priori''. 

In his criticism of [[Immanuel Kant]], the German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] who tried to systematise dialectical understandings thus wrote: 

{{Quotation|The principles of the metaphysical philosophy gave rise to the belief that, when cognition lapsed into contradictions, it was a mere accidental aberration, due to some subjective mistake in argument and inference. According to Kant, however, thought has a natural tendency to issue in [[contradiction]]s or [[antinomy|antinomies]], whenever it seeks to apprehend the infinite. We have in the latter part of the above paragraph referred to the philosophical importance of the antinomies of [[reason]], and shown how the recognition of their existence helped largely to get rid of the rigid dogmatism of the metaphysic of understanding, and to direct attention to the Dialectical movement of thought. But here too Kant, as we must add, never got beyond the negative result that the thing-in-itself is unknowable, and never penetrated to the discovery of what the antinomies really and positively mean. That true and positive meaning of the antinomies is this: that every actual thing involves a coexistence of opposed elements. Consequently to know, or, in other words, to comprehend an object is equivalent to being conscious of it as a concrete unity of opposed determinations. The old metaphysic, as we have already seen, when it studied the objects of which it sought a metaphysical knowledge, went to work by applying categories abstractly and to the exclusion of their opposites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/sl_iv.htm#SL48n Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences (1830) Part One IV. Second Attitude of Thought to Objectivity ''TWO. THE CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY'' §48]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his philosophy, Hegel ventured to describe quite a few cases of "unity of opposites", including the concepts of [[Infinity|Finite and Infinite]], [[Force]] and [[Matter]], [[Identity (social science)|Identity]] and [[Difference (philosophy)|Difference]], Positive and Negative, [[Substantial form|Form]] and [[wikt:content|Content]], [[Chance (philosophy)|Chance]] and [[Metaphysical necessity|Necessity]], [[Causality|Cause and effect]], [[Freedom of will|Freedom]] and [[Metaphysical necessity|Necessity]], [[Subjectivity]] and [[objectivity (science)|Objectivity]], [[Means (ethics)|Means]] and [[End (philosophy)|Ends]], [[Subject (grammar)|Subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|Object]], and [[Abstract object|Abstract]] and [[Concrete]]. It is also considered to be integral to [[Marxist_philosophy_of_nature#Law_of_opposites|Marxist philosophy of nature]] and is discussed in [[Friedrich Engels]]' ''[[Dialectics of Nature]]''.

==''Coincidentia oppositorum''==
''Coincidentia oppositorum'' is a Latin phrase meaning coincidence of opposites.  It is a [[neoplatonic]] term attributed to 15th century German polymath [[Nicholas of Kues|Nicholas of Cusa]] in his essay, ''[[De Docta Ignorantia]]'' (1440).  [[Mircea Eliade]], a 20th-century historian of religion, used the term extensively in his [[Mircea_Eliade#Coincidentia_oppositorum|essays about myth and ritual]], describing the ''coincidentia oppositorum'' as "the mythical pattern".  Psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]], the philosopher and Islamic Studies professor [[Henry Corbin]] as well as Jewish philosophers [[Gershom Scholem]] and [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] also used the term.  
In [[alchemy]], ''coincidentia oppositorum'' is a synonym for ''coniunctio''. For example, [[Michael Maier]] stresses that the union of opposites is the aim of the alchemical work. Or, according to [[Paracelsus]]' pupil, [[Gerhard Dorn]], the highest grade of the alchemical ''coniunctio'' consisted in the union of the total man with the ''[[unus mundus]]'' ("one world"). 

The term is also used in describing a revelation of the oneness of things previously believed to be different. Such insight into the unity of things is a kind of [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], and is found in various mystical traditions. The idea occurs in the traditions of [[Tantra|Tantric]] [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], in [[German mysticism]], [[Taoism]], [[Zen]] and [[Sufism]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In [[computer science]], a '''value''' is the representation of some entity that can be manipulated by a program. The members of a [[type (computer science)|type]] are the values of that type.{{sfn|Mitchell|1996|p=9}} 

The "value of a variable" is given by the corresponding [[Map (computer science)|mapping]] in the [[environment (type theory)|environment]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In languages with [[assignable variable]]s it becomes necessary to distinguish between the ''r-value'' (or contents) and the ''l-value'' (or location) of a variable.{{sfn|Mitchell|1996|pp=389–390}}

In [[Declarative programming|declarative]] (high-level) languages, values have to be [[referential transparency (computer science)|referentially transparent]]. This means that the resulting value is independent of the location in which a (sub-)expression needed to compute the value is stored. Only the contents of the location (the bits, whether they are 1 or 0) and their interpretation are significant.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

=={{Anchor|lrvalue}}Assignment: l-values and r-values==
Some languages use the idea of '''l-values''' and '''r-values''', deriving from the typical mode of evaluation on the left and right hand side of an assignment statement. An lvalue refers to an object that persists beyond a single expression. An rvalue is a temporary value that does not persist beyond the expression that uses it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lvalues and Rvalues (Visual C++)|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f90831hc.aspx|website=Microsoft Developer Network|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of l-values and r-values was introduced by [[Combined Programming Language]] (CPL). The notions in an expression of r-value, l-value, and r-value/l-value are analogous to the [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameter]] modes of input parameter (has a value), [[output parameter]] (can be assigned), and input/output parameter (has a value and can be assigned), though the technical details differ between contexts and languages.

===R-values and addresses===
In many languages, notably the [[C programming language|C family]], l-values have [[memory address|storage address]]es that are programmatically accessible to the running program (e.g., via some address-of operator like "&amp;" in C/C++), meaning that they are variables or dereferenced references to a certain memory location. R-values can be l-values (see below) or non-l-values—a term only used to distinguish from l-values. Consider the C expression &lt;code&gt;4 + 9&lt;/code&gt;. When executed, the computer generates an integer value of 13, but because the program has not explicitly designated where in the computer this 13 is stored, the expression is a non l-value. On the other hand, if a C program declares a variable x and assigns the value of 13 to x, then the expression &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; has a value of 13 and is an l-value.

In C, the term l-value originally meant something that could be assigned to (hence the name, indicating it is on the left side of the assignment operator), but since the reserved word &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; (constant) was added to the language, the term is now 'modifiable l-value'. In [[C++11]] a special semantic-glyph &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; exists, to denote the ''use/access of the expression's address for the ''compiler'' only''; i.e., the address cannot be retrieved using the address-of, &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;, operator during the ''run-time'' of the program (see [[C++11#Rvalue references and move constructors|the use of move semantics]]).

This type of reference can be applied to ''all'' r-values including non-l-values as well as l-values. Some processors provide one or more instructions which take an '''immediate value''', sometimes referred to as "immediate" for short. An immediate value is stored as part of the instruction which employs it, usually to load into, add to, or subtract from, a register. The other parts of the instruction are the [[opcode]], and destination. The latter may be implicit. (A non-immediate value may reside in a register, or be stored elsewhere in memory, requiring the instruction to contain a direct or indirect address [e.g., index register address] to the value.)

The l-value expression designates (refers to) an object. A non-modifiable l-value is addressable, but not assignable. A modifiable l-value allows the designated object to be changed as well as examined. An r-value is any expression, a non-l-value is any expression that is not an l-value. One example is an "immediate value" (look below) and consequently not addressable..

== In assembly language ==
A value can be virtually any kind of data by a given [[data type]], for instance a string, a digit, a single letter.

Processors often support more than one size of immediate data, e.g. 8 or 16 bit, employing a unique opcode and mnemonic for each instruction variant. If a programmer supplies a data value that will not fit, the assembler issues an "Out of range" error message. Most assemblers allow an immediate value to be expressed as [[ASCII]], [[decimal]], [[hexadecimal]], [[octal]], or [[Binary code|binary]] data. Thus, the ASCII character &lt;tt&gt;'A'&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as &lt;tt&gt;65&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;0x41&lt;/tt&gt;. The [[byte order]] of strings may differ between processors, depending on the assembler and computer architecture.

In [[astronomy]], [[geography]], and related sciences and contexts, a ''[[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]]'' or ''[[plane (geometry)|plane]]'' passing by a given point is said to be '''vertical''' if it contains the local [[gravity direction]] at that point.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, a direction or plane is said to be '''horizontal''' if it is perpendicular to the vertical direction.

The usage of the inter-related terms '''horizontal''' and '''vertical''' as well as their symmetries and asymmetries vary with context (e.g. two vs. three dimensions).
In general, something that is vertical can be drawn from up to down (or down to up), such as the y-axis in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

==Historical definition==
[[Girard Desargues]] defined the vertical to be [[horizon#Projective geometry|perpendicular to the horizon]] in his ''Perspective'' of 1636.

The word "horizontal" is derived from "[[horizon]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|horizontal}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas "vertical" originates in the late [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|verticalis}}'', which is from the same root as ''[[Vertex (disambiguation)|vertex]]'' 'highest point'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|vertical}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geophysical definition==
{{further|Gravity of Earth|Figure of Earth}}

===The plumb line and spirit level===
[[File:Bubble on a marble shelf.PNG|thumb|Spirit level bubble on a marble shelf tests for horizontality]]
In physics, in engineering, and in construction, the direction designated as vertical is usually that along which a [[plumb-bob]] hangs. Alternatively, a [[spirit level]] that exploits the buoyancy of an air bubble and its tendency to go vertically upwards may be used to test for horizontality. Modern rotary laser levels that can level themselves automatically are robust sophisticated instruments and work on the same fundamental principle.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.laser-level.co.uk/products/stabila-rotary-lasers/stabila-lar200.html Laser Levels]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For how a spirit level works, see http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=562730&lt;/ref&gt;

===The flat earth approximation===
In the flat earth scenario,&lt;ref&gt;See ''Theory and Problems of Theoretical Mechanics" by Murray R Spiegel, 1987, pg 62&lt;/ref&gt; where the earth is notionally a large (infinite) flat surface with gravitational field at a right angle to the surface, the earth surface is horizontal and any plane parallel to the earth surface is also horizontal.  Vertical planes, e.g., walls, may be parallel to each other or they may intersect at a vertical line. Horizontal surfaces do not intersect. Furthermore, a  plane cannot both be a horizontal plane at one place and a vertical plane somewhere else.

===The spherical Earth===
[[File:Vertical wall are never parallel.PNG|thumb|Strictly, vertical walls are never parallel on the surface of a spherical planet]]
When the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the concepts of vertical and horizontal take on yet another meaning. On the surface of a smoothly spherical, homogenous, non-rotating planet, the plumb bob picks out as vertical the radial direction. Strictly speaking, it is now no longer possible for vertical walls to be parallel: ''all'' verticals intersect. This fact has real practical applications in construction and civil engineering, e.g., the tops of the towers of a suspension bridge are further apart than at the bottom. 
&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia.com. In very long bridges, it may be necessary to take the earth's curvature into account when designing the towers. For example, in the New York's Verrazano Narrows Bridge, the towers, which are 700 ft (215 m) tall and stand 4260 ft (298 m) apart, are about 1.75 in (4.5 cm) farther apart at the top than they are at the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Horizontal planes can intersect.PNG|thumbnail|On a spherical planet, horizontal planes intersect. In the example shown, the blue line represents the tangent plane at the North pole, the red the tangent plane at an equatorial point. The two intersect at a right angle.]]
Also, horizontal planes can intersect when they are [[tangent]] planes to separated points on the surface of the earth. In particular, a plane tangent to a point on the equator intersects the plane tangent to the [[North Pole]] at a [[right angle]]. (See diagram).
Furthermore, the [[equator]]ial plane is parallel to the tangent plane at the North Pole and as such has claim to be a horizontal plane. But it is. at the same time, a vertical plane for points on the equator. In this sense, a plane can, arguably, be ''both'' horizontal and vertical, horizontal ''at one place'', and vertical ''at another''.

=== Further complications===
{{Main Article|Vertical deflection}}
For a spinning earth, the plumb line deviates from the radial direction as a function of latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://faculty.trinityvalleyschool.org/hoseltom/handouts/Chap%2014-Ax-Plumb-bob%20Deviation%20w%20Latitude-34PbyE.pdf|title= Working in the Rotating Reference Frame of the Earth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only at the North and South Poles does the plumb line align with the local radius. The situation is actually even more complicated because earth is not a [[homogeneous]] smooth sphere. It is a non homogeneous, non spherical, knobby planet in motion, and the vertical not only need not lie along a radial, it may even be curved and be varying with time. On a smaller scale, a mountain to one side may deflect the plumb bob away from the true [[zenith]].&lt;ref&gt;Such a deflection was measured by [[Nevil Maskelyne]]. See Maskelyne, N. (1775). "An Account of Observations Made on the Mountain Schiehallion for Finding Its Attraction". Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. 65 (0): 500–542. doi:10.1098/rstl.1775.0050. [[Charles Hutton]] used the observed value to determine the density of the earth.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a larger scale the gravitational field of the earth, which is at least approximately radial near the earth, is not radial when it is affected by the moon at higher altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Walls and floors ===
[[File:Brick wall close-up view.jpg|thumb|Brick wall showing horizontal mortar courses and vertical perpendiculars. By contrast, a level floor only contains horizontal lines.]] 
On a (horizontal) floor, one can draw a horizontal line but not a vertical line in the sense of a plumb bob line. But on a (vertical) wall, one can draw both vertical ''and'' horizontal lines. In this sense, a vertical wall allows more options. This is reflected in the tools a bricklayer uses: a plumb line for verticality and a spirit level to check that the mortar courses are horizontal.
On the other hand, in contrast to a wall a horizontal floor allows more options when one considers compass directions. One can draw on a floor lines going north, south, east, and west, in fact, along any compass direction. A wall allows fewer options. For instance, on a wall which runs along a longitude, an insect cannot crawl east.

=== Independence of horizontal and vertical motions ===
Neglecting the curvature of the earth, horizontal and vertical motions of a projectile moving under gravity are independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Salters Hornerns Advanced Physics Project, As Student Book, Edexcel Pearson, London,  2008, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical displacement of a projectile is not affected by the horizontal component of the launch velocity, and, conversely, the horizontal displacement is unaffected by the vertical component.  The notion dates at least as far back as Galileo.&lt;ref&gt;See Galileo's discussion of how bodies rise and fall under gravity on a moving ship in his ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems''(trans. S. Drake). University of California Press, Berkeley, 1967, pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the independence of the two motion does ''not'' hold. For example, even a projectile fired in a horizontal direction (i.e., with a zero vertical component) may leave the surface of the spherical earth and indeed escape altogether.&lt;ref&gt;See Harris Benson ''University Physics'', New York 1991, page 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical definition==

===In two dimensions===
[[File:Vertical horizontal.PNG|thumb|In two dimensions. 1. The vertical direction is designated. 2. The horizontal is normal to the vertical. Through any point P, there is exactly one vertical and exactly one horizontal. Alternatively, one can start by designating the horizontal direction.]]

In the context of a two-dimensional orthogonal [[Cartesian coordinate system]] on  a Euclidean plane, to say that a line is horizontal or vertical, an initial designation has to be made. One can start off by designating the vertical direction, usually labelled  the Y direction.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of identification of the ''y''-axis with the vertical, and the ''x''-axis with the horizontal, see G.S.Rehill's ''Interactive Maths Series, "Building a Strong foundation in Mathematics"'', accessible on http://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year8/ch15_graphs/05_hor/ver.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The horizontal direction, usually labelled the X direction,&lt;ref&gt;For a definition of "Horizontal axis" see Math Dictionary at http://www.icoachmath.com/math_dictionary/Horizontal_Axis.html&lt;/ref&gt; is then automatically determined. Or, one can do it the other way around, i.e., nominate the ''x''-axis, in which case the ''y''-axis is then automatically determined. There is no special reason to choose the horizontal over the vertical as the initial designation: the two directions are on par in this respect.

The following hold in the two-dimensional case:
# Through any point P in the plane, there is one and only one ''vertical line'' within the plane and one and only one ''horizontal line'' within the plane. This symmetry breaks down as one moves to the three-dimensional case.
# A  ''vertical line'' is any line parallel to the vertical direction. A ''horizontal line'' is any line normal to a vertical line.
# Horizontal lines do not cross each other.
#Vertical lines do not cross each other.

Not all of these elementary geometric facts are true in the 3-D context.

===In three dimensions===
In the three-dimensional case, the situation is more complicated as now one has horizontal and vertical planes in addition to horizontal and vertical lines. Consider a point P and designate a direction through P as vertical. A plane which contains P and is normal to the designated direction is the ''[[horizontal plane]]'' at P. Any plane going through P, normal to the horizontal plane is a  ''[[vertical plane]]'' at P. Through any point P, there is one and only one horizontal plane but a ''multiplicity'' of vertical planes. This is a new feature that emerges in three dimensions. The symmetry that exists in the two-dimensional case no longer holds.

=== In the classroom===
[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The ''y''-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal]]
In the 2-dimension case, as mentioned already, the usual designation of the vertical coincides with the [[y-axis]] in co-ordinate geometry. This convention can cause confusion in the classroom. For the teacher, writing perhaps on a white board, the ''y''-axis really is  vertical in the sense of the plumbline verticality but for the student the axis may well lie on a horizontal table.

Although the word horizontal is commonly used in daily life and language (see below), it is subject to many misconceptions.

* The concept of horizontality only makes sense in the context of a clearly measurable gravity field, i.e., in the 'neighborhood' of a planet, star, etc. When the gravity field becomes very weak (the masses are too small or too distant from the point of interest), the notion of being horizontal loses its meaning.
[[File:Verticals at separate points.PNG|thumb|Verticals at two separate points are not parallel. The same holds for their associated horizontal planes]]
* A plane is horizontal only at the chosen point. Horizontal planes at two separate points are not parallel, they intersect.
* In general, a horizontal plane will only be perpendicular to a [[vertical direction]] if both are specifically defined with respect to the same point: a direction is only vertical at the point of reference. Thus both horizontality and verticality are strictly speaking local concepts, and it is always necessary to state to which location the direction or the plane refers to. Note that (1) the same restriction applies to the straight lines contained within the plane: they are horizontal only at the point of reference, and (2) those straight lines contained in the plane but not passing by the reference point are not necessarily horizontal anywhere.
[[File:Gravitational field due to knobbly planet.PNG|thumb|field lines for a non homogeneous knobbly planet in motion may be curved. The white, red and hlue bits illustrate the planet's heterogeneity.]]
* In reality, the gravity field of a heterogeneous planet such as [[Earth]] is deformed due to the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of materials with different [[density|densities]]. Actual horizontal planes are thus not even parallel even if their reference points are along the same vertical line, since a vertical line is slightly curved.
* At any given location, the total gravitational force is not quite constant over [[time]], because the objects that generate the gravity are moving. For instance, on Earth the horizontal plane at a given point (as determined by a pair of [[spirit level]]s) changes with the position of the Moon (air, sea and land [[tide]]s).
* On a rotating planet such as Earth, the strictly gravitational pull of the planet (and other celestial objects such as the Moon, the [[Sun]], etc.) is different from the apparent net force (e.g., on a free-falling object) that can be measured in the laboratory or in the field. This difference is the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] associated with the planet's rotation. This is a [[fictitious force]]: it only arises when calculations or experiments are conducted in [[Inertial frame of reference|non-inertial frames of reference]], such as the surface of the Earth.

In general, something that is horizontal can be drawn from left to right (or right to left), such as the x-axis in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Practical use in daily life===

The concept of a horizontal plane is thus anything but simple, although, in practice, most of these effects and variations are rather small: they are measurable and can be predicted with great accuracy, but they may not greatly affect our daily life.

This dichotomy between the apparent simplicity of a concept and an actual complexity of defining (and measuring) it in scientific terms arises from the fact that the typical linear scales and dimensions of relevance in daily life are 3 [[orders of magnitude]] (or more) smaller than the size of the Earth. Hence, the world appears to be flat locally, and horizontal planes in nearby locations appear to be parallel. Such statements are nevertheless approximations; whether they are acceptable in any particular context or application depends on the applicable requirements, in particular in terms of accuracy.
[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The y-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal.]]
In graphical contexts, such as [[Technical drawing|drawing and drafting]] and Co-ordinate geometry on rectangular paper, it is very common to associate one of the dimensions of the paper with a horizontal, even though the entire sheet of paper is standing on a flat horizontal (or slanted) table. In this case, the horizontal direction is typically from the left side of the paper to the right side. This is purely conventional (although it is somehow 'natural' when drawing a natural scene as it is seen in reality), and may lead to misunderstandings or misconceptions, especially in an educational context.

{{Politics of Singapore}}

The '''right to vote in Singapore''' is not explicitly stated in [[Singapore]]'s [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]], but the [[Government of Singapore|Government]] has expressed the view that it may be inferred from the fact that Singapore is a [[representative democracy in Singapore|representative democracy]] and from specific constitutional provisions, including Articles 65 and 66 which set out requirements for the [[Parliament of Singapore#Sessions|prorogation and dissolution of Parliament]] and the holding of [[Parliamentary elections in Singapore|general elections]]. Speaking on the matter in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] in 2009, the [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Minister for Law]], [[K. Shanmugam]], said that the [[suffrage|right to vote]] could not be a mere privilege as this would imply the existence of an institution superior to the body of citizens that is empowered to grant such a privilege, but that no such institution exists in a free country. In 1966 a Constitutional Commission chaired by [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] [[Wee Chong Jin]] advocated entrenching the right to vote within the Constitution, but this was not taken up by the Parliament of the day. When this proposal was repeated during the 2009 parliamentary debate, the Government took the view that such entrenchment was unnecessary.

In ''[[Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong#Constitutional arguments before the High Court|Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (1998), the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] suggested on an ''[[obiter dictum|obiter]]'' basis that voting is a privilege rather than a right. It has been suggested by law academic [[Thio Li-ann]] that, if called upon to decide the issue, the court might infer the existence of the right to vote in the Constitution from its text and structure, and from the fact that it is an adaptation of the [[Westminster system]] of democracy. If the right to vote were to be found to be implicit in the Constitution, the [[judicial system of Singapore|judiciary]] would be better able to protect the right when issues arise before the courts.

The Parliamentary Elections Act and Presidential Elections Act regulate the exercise of the vote and set out the procedures for [[parliamentary elections in Singapore|parliamentary]] and [[presidential elections in Singapore]]. These are ordinary statutes which can be changed by a [[majority|simple majority]] in Parliament. All [[Singaporean nationality law|Singapore citizens]] not less than 21 years old on the cut-off date for the registration of electors (1 January of a particular year), and ordinarily resident in the country, are entitled to vote in both parliamentary and presidential elections. A [[one man, one vote|one person, one vote]] system is currently in operation, though in 1994 [[Senior Minister]] and former [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] suggested that people aged between 35 and 60 who were married with children should be given two votes each due to their greater responsibilities and contributions to society. Overseas voting was introduced in 2001, and first carried out during the [[Singaporean general election, 2006|2006 general election]].

A person is disqualified from voting in certain circumstances, which include engaging in acts incompatible with being a Singapore citizen, being of unsound mind, or being in prison for committing a criminal offence. The constitutionality of the statutory provisions denying prisoners the right to vote has not yet become an issue in Singapore, though it has been controversial in some foreign jurisdictions.

==Introduction==
[[File:Thomas Paine.jpg|thumb|upright|A ''c.'' 1876 portrait of [[Thomas Paine]] (1737–1809) by Auguste Millière, based on an earlier work by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]]. Paine, one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], called the [[suffrage|right to vote]] one of an individual's personal rights, which are "a species of property of the most sacred kind".]]

The [[suffrage|right to vote]] forms the foundation of [[representative democracy]], that is, [[democracy]] based on the principle of citizens electing a group of people to represent their interests. The various models of government that fall under the general term "representative democracy", namely, the protective, participatory and elite models, are all based upon the underlying principle of equality of rights, including the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Glenn Patmore|title=Making Sense of Representative Democracy and the Implied Freedom of Political Communication in the High Court of Australia: Three Possible Models|journal=[[Griffith Law School|Griffith Law Review]]|year=1998|volume=7|issue=1|pages=97–123 at 99–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Popular government" was referred to by [[John Stuart Mill]] as "where the supreme controlling power ... is vested in the entire aggregate of the community",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=John Stuart Mill|authorlink=John Stuart Mill|title=Considerations on Representative Government|edition=2nd|location=London|publisher=Parker, Son &amp; Bourn|year=1861|pages=45–69|oclc=644467430}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Edmund Burke]] argued that it has the desirable consequence of establishing a government that has a unified public interest, with its citizens absent of personal prejudices except for that of the public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Edmund Burke|authorlink=Edmund Burke|chapter=Speech to the Electors of Bristol, on His Being Declared by the Sheriffs Duly Elected One of the Representatives in Parliament for that City, on Thursday, the 3d of November, 1774|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm#ELECTORS_OF_BRISTOL|volume=2|title=The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke|location=London|publisher=John C.

[[Thomas Paine]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], said that the right to vote is critical in the protection of individual freedoms. He called it one of an individual's personal rights, which are "a species of property of the most sacred kind", and expressed the view that "[t]o take away this right is to reduce a man to slavery, ... subject to the will of another ... [T]o disfranchise any class of men is as criminal as the proposal to take away property".&lt;ref&gt;Paine, pp. 334 and 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine's view was that there is no justification for one part of a community to deny another its right to vote on any basis, whether class, race, religion or political creed. His view survives in various international instruments such as [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 21|Article 21(1)]] of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Art.&amp;nbsp;21(1) of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] Resolution 217A(III), U.N. G.A.O.R., 3d Sess., Supp. No. 13. U.N. Doc. A/180 (1948), p. 71, declares: "Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives".&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' {{ussc|377|533|1964}}, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] (US).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Earl Warren]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;''Reynolds'', pp. 555 and 561–562.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government. ... Undoubtedly, the right of suffrage is a fundamental matter in a free and democratic society. ... As long as ours is a representative form of government, and our legislatures are those instruments of government elected directly by and directly representative of the people, the right to elect legislators in a free and unimpaired fashion is a bedrock of our political system.}}

The term ''[[representative democracy in Singapore|representative democracy]]'' does not appear in the [[Constitution of Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|rep=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, an analogy may be drawn from the approach taken by the [[High Court of Australia]] to the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]]. In ''[[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Lange v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'' (1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Lange v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation|link=Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation|source=HCA|num=25|year=1997|parallelcite=189 C.L.R. 520|courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]|juris=Australia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court inferred that the Constitution embodies a system of representative and [[responsible government]] from various provisions, including those requiring periodic elections to choose the members of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lange'', pp. 557–559.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Singapore Constitution prescribes that [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] may be dissolved by the [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] under certain conditions,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Arts. 65(2)–(3A).&lt;/ref&gt; and will be automatically dissolved by [[operation of law]] five years from its first sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art.&amp;nbsp;65(4).&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Parliamentary elections in Singapore|general election]] must be held within three months after each dissolution of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art.&amp;nbsp;66.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution also states that "[t]he President shall be elected by the citizens of Singapore in accordance with any law made by the Legislature",&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 17(2).&lt;/ref&gt; and requires a poll for the election to be held not more than three months before the incumbent's term of office expires, or, if the office is vacated before the expiry date, within six months of the date when it becomes vacant.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 17(3).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in the Proclamation of Singapore contained in the Independence of Singapore Agreement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Independence of Singapore Agreement}}. The Agreement appears in the ''Revised Edition of the Statutes of the Republic of Singapore'' in a section entitled "Constitutional Documents".&lt;/ref&gt; which was entered into by the [[Government of Malaysia|Governments of Malaysia]] and [[Government of Singapore|Singapore]] to effect Singapore's separation from Malaysia, the then Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] proclaimed on behalf of the people and the Government that as from 9 August 1965 "Singapore shall be forever a sovereign democratic and independent nation&amp;nbsp;...".

==Status of the right==
===Judicial view===
In ''[[Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong#Constitutional arguments before the High Court|Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (1998),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong#Constitutional arguments before the High Court|Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' [1998] 1 S.L.R.(R.) [''Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)''] 78, [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] expressed the ''[[obiter dictum|obiter]]'' view that the right to vote does not have constitutional status but is a privilege:&lt;ref&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'', p. 102, para. 56 (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Constitutional rights are enjoyed because they are constitutional in nature. They are enjoyed as fundamental liberties – not stick-and-carrot  privileges. To the extent that the Constitution is supreme, those rights are inalienable. Other ''privileges'' such as subsidies or the ''right to vote'' are enjoyed because the Legislature chooses to confer them – they are expressions of policy and political will. [Emphasis added.]}}

===Government's view===
The juridical status of the right to vote was subsequently debated in Parliament on 16 May 2001 upon an [[Parliament of Singapore#Suspension and adjournment|adjournment]] [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] introduced by [[Non-constituency Member of Parliament]] [[Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam]]. Jeyaretnam argued that since "the marking of a [[ballot|ballot paper]] is an expression of the voter", the right to vote is protected by the freedom of expression clause set out in [[Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=J.B.

{{quote|While the Constitution does not contain an expressed declaration of the right to vote, I have been advised by the Attorney General&amp;nbsp;... that the right to vote at parliamentary and presidential elections is implied within the structure of our Constitution. We have a parliamentary form of government. The Constitution provides for regular general elections to make up Parliament and establishes representative democracy in Singapore. So the right to vote is fundamental to a representative democracy, which we are, and that is why we have the Parliamentary Elections Act to give effect to this right.}}

[[File:K Shanmugam (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Minister for Law]] [[K. Shanmugam]], who stated in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] on 13 February 2009 that the [[suffrage|right to vote]] is an implied [[Constitution of Singapore|constitutional]] right]]

The heading of section 38 of the Parliamentary Elections Act ("PEA")&lt;ref name="PEA"&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Parliamentary Elections Act|cap=218|ed=2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is "Registers of electors to be conclusive evidence of right to vote". Subsection (1) provides that the current register of electors is conclusive evidence for determining whether a person is entitled to vote at an election, and subsection (2) states that a person's "right and duty of voting" is not prejudiced if there is an appeal pending as to whether his or her name is properly on the register.

The status of the right to vote was again considered in Parliament in 2009. During debates on the [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Ministry of Law]]'s annual budget on 12 February, [[Nominated Member of Parliament]] [[Thio Li-ann]] asked if the right to vote is "a constitutional right and part of the fundamental law of the land, or merely a statutory right, regulated by ordinary law?"&lt;ref name="2009 debate: Thio"&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|prefix=Professor|mp=Thio Li-ann|mplink=Thio Li-ann|office=[[Nominated Member of Parliament|NMP]]|title=Head R – Ministry of Law: Legal Status of the Right to Vote and Entrenchment|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00073412-ZZ|date=12 February 2009|volume=85|column=3111''[[wikt:ff.#Abbreviation|ff]]''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Replying to Thio the following day, Minister for Law [[K. Shanmugam]] referred to the 2001 debate on the matter and confirmed that, having conferred with the [[Attorney-General of Singapore|Attorney-General]], in the [[Government of Singapore|Government]]'s view the right to vote is an implied constitutional right arising from various provisions of the Constitution, including Articles 65 and 66.&lt;ref name=Shanmugam&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=K.

Articles 65(2) to 65(3A) explain when the Prime Minister may dissolve Parliament, while Article 65(4) specifically provides that Parliament has a fixed term: "Parliament, unless sooner dissolved, shall continue for 5 years from the date of its first sitting and shall then stand dissolved." Article 66 states: "There shall be a general election at such time, within 3 months after every dissolution of Parliament, as the [[President of Singapore|President]] shall, by Proclamation in the Gazette, appoint." The Minister also said:&lt;ref name=Shanmugam/&gt;

{{quote|The power of our citizens to vote cannot be a privilege, because that would imply that there is some institution superior to the body of citizens which is in a position to grant such a privilege to the citizens. But in a free country, there is no institution that can be in such a position to grant such a privilege to the citizens. In a Representative Democracy like Singapore, voting is therefore a right, not a privilege.}}

As regards the High Court's view in ''Taw Cheng Kong'', the Minister noted that it could not be treated as a [[precedent]] since "[t]he legal nature of the citizens' right to vote was not an issue in that case and was not specifically argued".&lt;ref name=Shanmugam/&gt; Thio Li-ann has commented that the Minister's clarification "dealt the ''quietus est'' to the High Court's odd pronouncement in ''Taw Cheng Kong v.

On 18 January 1966, shortly after [[history of the Republic of Singapore#Independence of Singapore|Singapore's independence]], the President appointed a Constitutional Commission led by [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] [[Wee Chong Jin]] to consider how the rights of racial, linguistic, and religious minorities in the nascent nation should be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=David S[aul] Marshall|authorlink=David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|title=[The Presidential Council:] Paper II|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=1969|volume=1|pages=9–13 at 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In its report on 27 August 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Report of the Constitutional Commission, 1966 [chairman: [[Wee Chong Jin]] C.J.]|location=Singapore|publisher=Government Printer|year=1966|oclc=51640681}}, reproduced in {{citation|author=Kevin Y[ew] L[ee] Tan|author2=Thio Li-ann|title=Constitutional Law in Malaysia and Singapore|edition=2nd|location=Singapore|publisher=[[LexisNexis Butterworths|Butterworths Asia]]|year=1997|at=Appendix D|isbn=978-0-409-99908-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Commission recommended entrenching the right to vote as a "fundamental right" in the form of "the right to elect a government of their choice as expressed in general elections held at reasonable periodic intervals by secret vote".&lt;ref name="1966 Report 43"&gt;''Report of the Constitutional Commission, 1966'', para. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The chief justification for this proposal was the relatively infant or immature culture of democracy in a newly independent nation that was "barely one year old".&lt;ref name="Thio 410"&gt;Thio, "Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights", p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that citizens had only exercised the right to vote twice in general elections, in [[Singaporean general election, 1959|1959]] and [[Singaporean general election, 1963|1963]] respectively. Hence:&lt;ref name="1966 Report 43"/&gt;

{{quote|The people of Singapore have thus had little experience of general elections nor can it be safely assumed that they have grown up to cherish as an inalienable right, the right to be governed by a government of their own choice, expressed in periodic and general elections by universal and equal suffrage and held by secret vote ... [W]e do not consider it safe to assume that a significant proportion of the people of Singapore will be able to realise, until it is too late to prevent it, that any inroads have been made into the democratic system of general elections by a future government intent on undermining first and ultimately destroying the practice of democracy in Singapore.}}

However, Parliament decided not to entrench the right to vote, instead relegating voting rights to statutory regulation under the Parliamentary Elections Act.&lt;ref name="Thio 410"/&gt;

===2009 parliamentary debate===
During the 2009 parliamentary debate on the right to vote's status, Thio Li-ann proposed that, to avoid doubt, the right should be specifically set out in the Constitution. She argued that entrenching the right to vote through an Article in the Constitution would provide the opportunity to protect the details of the right. Currently, voting is regulated by the PEA.&lt;ref name="PEA"/&gt; As it is an ordinary statute, it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing the right to vote clearly in the Constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the universality and equality of votes to be protected from unjust manipulation.&lt;ref name="2009 debate: Thio"/&gt;

[[File:SingaporeConstitution-1999Rep-titlepage-20091226-02.jpg|thumb|left|A copy of the 1999 Reprint of the [[Constitution of Singapore]]]]

However, the Minister for Law said the Government was of the opinion that as the right to vote is an implied right in the Constitution, it was unnecessary for the Constitution to be amended to expressly mention the right. Articles 65 and 66 of the Constitution would be entrenched once Article 5(2A) is brought into force.&lt;ref name=Shanmugam/&gt; That Article, which has remained in abeyance since it was introduced in 1991, provides that a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] that seeks to amend, among other things, Article 65 or 66, must be supported at a national [[referendum]] by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast, unless the President consents to the amendment. Shanmugam went on to state that the concerns of the 1966 Constitutional Commission were now moot, as Singapore had since experienced ten general elections with a 95% voter turnout each time. Therefore, it could be assumed that the idea and experience of voting were deeply ingrained in Singaporean voters. Furthermore, some countries choose to draft their constitutions in great detail while others, like Singapore, set out a basic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;This view was repeated by Chong Wan Yieng, Press Secretary to the Minister for Law, in a letter to ''[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]'' newspaper. She stated that Singapore's legal heritage was a broadly worded constitution: {{citation|author=Chong Wan Yieng|title=A Constitutional Right: MinLaw|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/today20090310-2.2.32.3.aspx|newspaper=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|date=10 March 2009|page=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that countries such as North Korea and Myanmar were among those that had set out the right to vote within their constitutions. Shanmugam concluded that what was fundamental to protecting the right to vote was a Government committed to the [[rule of law doctrine in Singapore|rule of law]].&lt;ref name=Shanmugam/&gt; 

Following the parliamentary debate, in a 2009 article Thio elaborated that entrenching the right to vote in the Constitution would make it significantly more difficult for any corrupt government that came into power to curtail it, as a [[supermajority|super-majority]] of at least two-thirds of all [[Parliament of Singapore#Elected Members|elected Members of Parliament]] would be needed before a constitutional amendment could be made.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art.&amp;nbsp;5(2).&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, with control over a [[majority|simple majority]] of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art.&amp;nbsp;57(1): "Subject to this Constitution, all questions proposed for decision in Parliament shall be determined by a majority of the votes of the Members present and voting ...".&lt;/ref&gt; a ruling party, if it chose to, could direct amendments to the PEA or create new legislation to provide some citizens with, say, double the number of votes and protect this from constitutional challenge using a notwithstanding clause (that is, a provision stated to have legal effect despite the existence of other inconsistent laws). By not protecting such an important right, the freedom of Singapore's electoral system could be progressively curtailed.&lt;ref name="Thio 425"&gt;Thio, "Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights", pp. 425–426.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar point has been made by [[Singapore Management University]] constitutional law professor Jack Lee who noted that since Article 66 does not define the term ''general election'':&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jack Tsen-Ta Lee|title=Make the implicit explicit: Affirming right to vote in the Constitution would pre-empt the possibility of abuse by future govts &amp;#91;letter&amp;#93;|url=http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1952&amp;context=sol_research|format=PDF|newspaper=Today|date=20 February 2009|page=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... there does not appear to be anything in the Constitution to prevent a future government from, say, requiring all candidates to have their "suitability" for political office determined by a government-appointed committee meeting in private, the decision of which would be final. There could still be a "general election" of sorts, but clearly a {{sic|hide=y|greatly|-}}impoverished version.}}

Thio also argued that without a constitutionally expressed right to vote, the judiciary is handicapped in interpreting this implied right, given its conservative approach to reading the Constitution and the fact that it is unlikely to appeal to normative ideas such as representative democracy.&lt;ref name="Thio 425"/&gt;

==Judicial implication of the right in the Constitution==
Despite the Government's unequivocal view that the right to vote is an implied constitutional right, in Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine the meaning of the Constitution. Thio Li-ann has suggested that since the right's status is not likely to be brought before the courts in a dispute, the [[Cabinet of Singapore|Cabinet]] should refer the matter to the [[Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal]] pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution for an authoritative opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights", p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thio has argued that a court convened to determine whether the right to vote exists in the Constitution would give serious weight to the Minister of Law's pronouncements on the status of the right, as to agree with it would affirm rather than challenge executive or legislative power. Also, section 9A of the Interpretation Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Interpretation Act|cap=1|ed=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; requires a [[purposive theory|purposive interpretation]] of written law, including the Constitution, to "promote the purpose or object underlying the written law".&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act, s.&amp;nbsp;9A(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Sections 9A(3)(c) and (d) identify ministerial speeches made at the second readings of bills or "any relevant material in any official record of debates in Parliament" as appropriate aspects of the interpretive matrix.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights", pp. 419–420.&lt;/ref&gt; The court might then take one or both of the following approaches.

===Originalist interpretation===
The courts may choose to establish an imputed intention or traditional understanding of the existence of a right to vote, derived from the drafting style associated with the drafters of [[Westminster system|Westminster]] constitutions rather than the drafted text as it is. Thio has said that the framers of the Constitution worked with certain assumptions which they did not make explicit. In ''Hinds v. The Queen'' (1975),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Hinds v. The Queen|court=UKPC|year=1975|num=22|format=1|parallelcite=[1977] A.C. 195|courtname=auto|juris=Jamaica}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] said that:&lt;ref name="Hinds 212"&gt;''Hinds'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... a great deal can be, and in drafting practice often is, left to necessary implication from the adoption in the new constitution of a governmental structure which makes provision for a legislature, an executive and judicature. It is taken for granted that the basic principle of [[separation of powers]] will apply to the exercise of their respective functions by these three organs of government.}}

The court in ''Hinds'' held that, as "a rule of construction applicable to constitutional instruments" adopting the Westminster system, the "absence of express words" did not prevent the judicial powers of the new state being exclusively exercised by the judicature".&lt;ref name="Hinds 212"/&gt; Similarly, the right to vote was necessarily implied into the Constitution through its genesis as an adaptation of the Westminster system of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights", pp. 421–422.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation based on text and structure===
Thio has also argued that the courts may find that an implied right to vote can be derived from the existing structure of the Constitution and a purposive reading of Articles 65 and 66. According to this reading, a constitutional right to vote must be logically or practically necessary for preserving the integrity of that structure, as constitutionally established. In Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution, the appointment of the Prime Minister requires that he commands "the confidence of the majority of the Members of Parliament". As the Constitution places emphasis on the need for democratic legitimacy as well as general elections, it may be reasonable to infer that the structure of the Constitution provides for a right to vote as a fundamental instrument of democratic legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights", p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exercise of the vote==
The Parliamentary Elections Act&lt;ref name=PEA/&gt; regulates the exercise of the vote and sets out the procedures for [[parliamentary elections in Singapore]]. The right to vote in Singapore extends only to [[Singaporean nationality law|Singapore citizens]] who are ordinarily resident in Singapore and not less than 21 years old&lt;ref&gt;PEA, s.&amp;nbsp;5(1). When preparing or revising a register of electors, a Singapore citizen who has been issued an identity card on or before 1 January is [[presumption|presumed]], unless the contrary is proved, to have been ordinarily resident in Singapore on that date, to be at least 21 years old if he or she appears to be of that age based on the records held by the Commissioner of National Registration, and to reside in the electoral division and polling district in which his address is as shown in the Commissioner's records on 1 January: s.&amp;nbsp;5(2).&lt;/ref&gt; on the cut-off date for the registration of electors. This is known as the "prescribed date", and is currently 1 January of a particular year.&lt;ref&gt;PEA, s.&amp;nbsp;5(4) and the Parliamentary Elections (Prescribed Date) Order 2011 ([http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3Ae458cf03-cb38-482c-83e0-efda0198d4e3%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A03%2F01%2F2011%20TransactionTime%3A03%2F01%2F2011%20Status%3Ainforce;rec=0;whole=yes S 3/2011]).&lt;/ref&gt; A person is considered to be ordinarily resident in Singapore on 1 January in a year if he or she has lived in the country for a total of 30 days during the three years immediately before that date, even if on 1 January the person is not resident in the country.&lt;ref&gt;PEA, s.&amp;nbsp;5(1A).&lt;/ref&gt; Whether people are entitled to vote at a [[presidential elections in Singapore|presidential election]] also depends on whether they are entitled to have their names entered or retained in a register of electors maintained under the PEA.&lt;ref name="Presidential Elections Act"&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Presidential Elections Act|cap=240A|ed=2011}}, s.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore has a [[one man, one vote|one person, one vote]] system: [[plural voting]]&amp;nbsp;– that is, voting more than once in the electoral division that one is assigned to, or voting in more than one electoral division&amp;nbsp;– is illegal.&lt;ref name="PEA s 7"&gt;PEA, s.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a relative swing in votes against the ruling [[People's Action Party]] government in the [[Singaporean general election, 1984|general election of 1984]], the Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] raised the possibility of modifications to the one person, one vote system and said: "It is necessary to try and put some safeguards into the way in which people use their votes to bargain, coerce, to push, to jostle and get what they want without running the risk of losing the services of the government, because one day, by mistake, they will lose the services of the government."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=PM replies to voters' signal|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=24 December 1984|page=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in an interview to the US magazine ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' in January 1994, Lee, now [[Senior Minister]], suggested that a person between the ages of 40 and 60 with a family should be given two votes because "he is likely to be more careful, voting also for his children. He is more likely to vote in a serious way than a capricious young man under 30. But we haven't found it necessary yet. If it became necessary, we should do it. ... I'm not intellectually convinced that one-man, one-vote is the best. We practise it because that's what the British bequeathed us and we haven't really found a need to challenge that."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Fareed Zakaria|authorlink=Fareed Zakaria|title=Success – a family affair|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=11 March 1994}}; {{citation|author=Anna Teo|title=2 votes each for older people with families a better system – SM Lee|newspaper=[[Business Times (Singapore)|The Business Times]]|date=11 March 1994}}; {{citation|title=People over 40 with children 'should get two votes'|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=11 March 1994}}. See also {{citation|author=George Wong Seow Choon|title=Should all people really be given one vote each?

{{quote|It is not necessary to change our system at present. But, later, we may have to give more weighting to the people whose views should carry more weight because their contributions are greater, and their responsibilities are greater; in which case, we should consider giving those between the ages of 35 and 60, married and with families, one extra vote. Their contribution to the economy and to society is greatest at this stage of life. Also, they need to vote for themselves and also for their children. Their children have an interest that needs to be protected. Once past 60, their children would have grown up, and would vote for themselves. Then the parents should drop back to one vote. But during those critical years, 35–60, people who carry twice as much responsibility should have two votes. This will make for a more viable system and a more stable society.}}

Lee suggested that such a change should perhaps be implemented "in 15 to 20 years" if Singapore's [[birth rate]] had not increased, as policies might then be disproportionately influenced by people aged 60 and over. However, he emphasized that these were his personal views and had not been discussed by the Cabinet.&lt;ref name="ST 19940508"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{citation|author=Isabella Leung Ning Yim|title=Disappointing if Govt passes this proposal [letter]|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=18 May 1994}}; {{citation|author=Leslie Fong|title=Some-men-two-votes proposal deserves informed discussion|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=21 May 1994}}; {{citation|author=Yap Kim Sang|title=Don't dilute power of the vote of any citizen [letter]|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=24 May 1994}}; {{citation|author=Cherian George|title=Changing the political system a sign of mistrust|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=29 May 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, no such modification to the voting system has been made.

===Overseas voting===
Prior to May 2001, voters who were overseas on polling day could not vote. Operational concerns such as insufficient Singapore missions around the world, the possibility that the last known addresses of Singapore citizens overseas might not be current, and the difficulty of keeping track of citizens who were abroad, were cited for this restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Lua Ee Laine|author2=Disa Jek Sok Sim|author3=Christopher Theng Jer Koh|title=Principles and Practices of Voting: The Singapore Electoral System|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/singlrev17&amp;div=12|journal=Singapore Law Review|year=1996|volume=17|pages=244–321 at 279–280}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators took the view that such logistical issues should not deprive Singaporeans of their "sacred right to vote".&lt;ref&gt;Lua, Sim &amp; Koh, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SingaporeanEmbassyWashingtonDC01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Embassy of Singapore, Washington, D.C.|Embassy of Singapore]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], which is one of the venues used as a polling station for overseas voting in [[elections in Singapore|Singapore elections]]]]

Overseas voting was eventually introduced for both parliamentary and presidential elections with effect from 15 May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;By the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 2001 ([http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3Aa5b32ed0-bcf4-4640-9cdf-633d6f527467%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A15%2F05%2F2001%20TransactionTime%3A15%2F05%2F2001%20Status%3Apublished;rec=0;whole=yes No. 19 of 2001]) which, according to the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act (Commencement) Notification 2001 ([http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3Add932571-2a0f-4ec0-bd94-e67603b40950%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A15%2F05%2F2001%20TransactionTime%3A15%2F05%2F2001%20Status%3Ainforce;rec=0;whole=yes S&amp;nbsp;272/2001]), came into force on 15 May 2001. Overseas voting for presidential elections was effected by changes to the Presidential Elections Act which were made by the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 2001, s.&amp;nbsp;27 and the Sch.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking during the Second Reading of the bill that led to the change in the law, the Minister for Home Affairs, Wong Kan Seng, said that the Government recognized that increasing numbers of Singaporeans studied and worked abroad due to [[economic globalization]]. Thus, it had decided to introduce overseas voting on a small scale at the next general elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Wong Kan Seng|office=Minister for Home Affairs|reading=Second|bill=Parliamentary Elections (Amendment)|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00067991-ZZ|date=19 April 2001|volume=73|column=1506}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the law generally required overseas voters to have resided in Singapore for an aggregate of two years during the five-year period before the prescribed date. However, Singaporeans whom the Government had posted abroad were exempted from this requirement and so were their families.&lt;ref&gt;PEA (1999 Rev. Ed.), s.&amp;nbsp;5(1A)(a), inserted by the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 2001, s.&amp;nbsp;3(a).&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister explained that this requirement for residence in Singapore was a "necessary pre-condition to constituency representation and to prevent plural voting".&lt;ref&gt;Wong Kan Seng, speech during the Second Reading of the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill (19 April 2001), col. 1508.&lt;/ref&gt; J.B. Jeyaretnam criticized this restriction as discriminating against overseas voters.&lt;ref&gt;Jeyaretnam, speech during the Second Reading of the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill (19 April 2001), col. 1528.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeyaretnam 1722"&gt;Jeyaretnam, "Is Voting a Privilege or a Right?" (16 May 2001), col. 1722.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, following the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks that occurred in the United States on 11 September 2001]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|American military action in Afghanistan]] on 7 October, the Government decided to temporarily suspend overseas voting at the [[Singaporean general election, 2001|2001 general election]] as having large numbers of Singaporeans congregating at known locations at known times could put them at risk of further terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Wong Kan Seng|office=Minister for Home Affairs|reading=Second|bill=Parliamentary Elections (Temporary Suspension of Overseas Voting)|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00068203-ZZ|date=15 October 2001|volume=73|columns=2448–2449}}. The suspension was effected by the Parliamentary Elections (Temporary Suspension of Overseas Voting) Act 2001 ([http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3A9b0a02bd-fa6b-485a-807d-25802781ca66%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A26%2F09%2F2001%20TransactionTime%3A17%2F10%2F2001%20Status%3Ainforce;rec=0;whole=yes No. 45 of 2001]), which was deemed to have come into force on 26 September 2001: s.&amp;nbsp;1. The Act suspended the provisions of the PEA allowing for the registration of overseas electors and providing for overseas voting "until polling day of the first general election after the date of commencement of this Act" (s. 2), and thus ceased to have effect after the [[Singaporean general election, 2001|2001 general election]].&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, overseas voting first took place at the [[Singaporean general election, 2006|2006 general election]]. The number of Singapore citizens who registered to vote overseas was 1,017, and of these, 553 resided in the 16 constituencies that were contested in the election. Eventually, 335 electors voted at eight polling stations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Wong Kan Seng|office=Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs|reading=Second|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00072921-ZZ|bill=Parliamentary Elections (Amendment)|billurl=http://www.parliament.gov.sg/sites/default/files/080008.pdf|date=25 August 2008|volume=84|column=3014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With effect from 3 March 2009, the residence requirement for overseas voters was reduced to an aggregate of 30 days during the three years immediately before the prescribed date, and the special dispensation of the requirement applying to citizens working or studying abroad at the Government's direction and their families was removed.&lt;ref&gt;PEA (2007 Rev. Ed.), s.&amp;nbsp;5(1A), as amended by the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 2008 ([http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3A55413011-c416-4fd7-aca7-e43e0ba678e2%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A17%2F02%2F2008%20TransactionTime%3A17%2F02%2F2008%20Status%3Apublished;rec=0;whole=yes No. 14 of 2008]), s.&amp;nbsp;3(a).&lt;/ref&gt; The change was described in Parliament as a measure to "allow more overseas Singaporeans to vote. All an overseas Singaporean needs to do is to come home for 10 days a year to visit his family and friends."&lt;ref&gt;Wong Kan Seng, speech during the Second Reading of the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill (25 August 2008), col. 3014''ff.''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Voting in foreign elections====
Singapore citizens who vote in foreign countries may lose their right to vote in Singapore. The relevant provisions are section 6(1)(a)(ii) read with section 6(3) of the PEA:

One issue that has arisen is whether a Singaporean who votes in a foreign country where the right to vote is not exclusive to nationals of that country is disqualified from voting in a Singapore election. For instance, the United Kingdom permits citizens of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, including Singapore,&lt;ref&gt;[[Representation of the People Act 1983]] ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/2/contents 1983 c.&amp;nbsp;2]) (UK), ss. 1(1) and 2(1) read with the [[British Nationality Act 1981]] ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61/contents 1981 c.&amp;nbsp;61]) (UK), s.&amp;nbsp;37(1)(b) and the 3rd Sch.&lt;/ref&gt; who are resident in the UK and have leave to remain there (or do not require such leave) to register to vote in [[elections in the United Kingdom#General elections|general elections]] and [[elections in the United Kingdom#Regional and local elections|local government elections]].&lt;ref&gt;Representation of the People Act 1983, s.&amp;nbsp;4(6); see also {{citation|title=Who can register to vote?|url=http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/who_can_register_to_vote.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724123330/http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/who_can_register_to_vote.aspx|archivedate=24 July 2011|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]]|year=2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When queried, the [[Elections Department]] stated that since suffrage in the UK is not exclusive to British citizens, Singaporeans who vote there are still eligible to vote in Singapore. However, this interpretation of the PEA has not been tested in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Rachel Lin|title=Loophole in S'pore election laws throws up more questions|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=9 May 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Voting by prisoners====
{{See also|Felony disenfranchisement}}

Another potentially controversial provision is section 6(1)(b) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, which denies suffrage to convicted criminals serving jail sentences. The provision states:

{{quote|6.— (1) No person shall be entitled to have his name entered or retained in any register of electors if he — ...
:(b) is serving a sentence of imprisonment (by whatever name called) imposed by any court in or outside Singapore for an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding 12 months, or is under sentence of death imposed by any such court or is serving a sentence of imprisonment awarded in lieu of execution of any such sentence ...}}

In addition, section 6(1A) provides as follows:

{{quote|6.— (1A) Without prejudice to subsection (1), no person who is deemed to be ordinarily resident in Singapore under section 5(1A) shall be entitled to have his name entered or retained in any register of electors if he is —
:(a) serving a sentence of imprisonment (by whatever name called) in any prison, jail or other place of detention outside Singapore;
:(b) accused of an offence against any written law punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding 12 months and a warrant of arrest by a court in Singapore authorising his apprehension in relation to that offence remains in force; or
:(c) convicted by any court in Singapore of any offence punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding 12 months and a warrant of arrest by a court in Singapore authorising his apprehension in relation to that offence remains in force.}}

The issue of the constitutionality of this restriction has not yet arisen in any Singapore court, but during a Parliamentary debate in May 2001, Non-constituency Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaretnam challenged the provision as unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="Jeyaretnam 1722"/&gt;

The Singapore position may be compared with the situation in other jurisdictions. In Malaysia, the right to vote is entrenched in Article 119 of the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Federal Constitution]], but suffrage is similarly denied to those serving prison terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Malaysia]], Art.&amp;nbsp;119(3).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia'' (2009),&lt;ref&gt;''Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia'' [2009] 6 M.L.J. [''Malayan Law Journal''] 222, [[Court of Appeal of Malaysia|Court of Appeal]] (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that while detainees under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act 1960]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act 1960]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110722235828/http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%202/Act%2082.pdf Act 82, 2006 Reprint]), archived from [http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%202/Act%2082.pdf the original] on 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– who have not been convicted of any crime&amp;nbsp;– still enjoy the right to vote in national elections, that right may only be exercised only in the constituencies they are registered in, and does not extend to allowing them to vote while incarcerated elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;''Yazid bin Sufaat'', pp. 229 and 235, paras. 3 and 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of European countries reported in ''[[Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)|Hirst v. United Kingdom (No. 2)]]'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Hirst v. United Kingdom (No. 2)|link=Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)|court=ECHR|year=2005|num=681|parallelcite=(2006) 42 E.H.R.R. 41|courtname=auto}} (Grand Chamber).&lt;/ref&gt; a judgment of the [[European Court of Human Rights]], found that 18 states allowed prisoners to vote without restriction (Albania, Azerbaijan, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine), while in 13 states all prisoners were not allowed to vote (Armenia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Kingdom). In another 13 states, the right to vote could be restricted in some way (Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Latvia and Liechtenstein).&lt;ref&gt;''Hirst'', para. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hirst'', the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]]'s denial of the vote to prisoners was ruled contrary to [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 3 - elections|Protocol 1, Article 3]], of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which protects the right to regular, free and fair elections. The European Court said that the UK had to justify any deviation from universal suffrage, but the UK Government has so far desisted from applying the judgment after the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] voted on 10 February 2012 to maintain the country's blanket ban on voting by prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Nicholas Watt|author2=Alan Travis|title=MPs decide to keep blanket ban on prisoners' vote: Ministers drawing up compromise proposals after cross-party motion wins a majority of 212|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/feb/10/mps-blanket-ban-prisoners-vote?intcmp=239|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=10 February 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Every Canadian Needs A Copy.jpg|thumb|A woman distributing copies of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. [[Section Three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 3]] of the Charter guarantees the right to vote.]]

In Canada, the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] held in ''[[Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)]]'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)|link=Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)|source=scc|year=2002|num=68|parallelcite=[2002] 3 S.C.R. 519|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that a statutory provision prohibiting prisoners serving a sentence of two years or more from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by [[Section Three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 3]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], Pt. I of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]] (Canada), itself Sch. B of the [[Canada Act 1982]] ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1982/11/contents 1982 c.&amp;nbsp;11]) (UK).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court noted that the [[Government of Canada|Government]] could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be denied the right to vote as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's criminal act nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.&lt;ref&gt;''Sauvé'', paras. 20–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The foregoing cases may be contrasted with the position in the United States. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held in ''[[Richardson v. Ramirez]]'' (1974)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Richardson v. Ramirez]]'' {{ussc|418|24|1974}}, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] (US).&lt;/ref&gt; that a California statute permanently removing the right to vote from any person convicted of an "infamous crime" unless the right to vote was restored by court order or executive pardon did not violate the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]]. The Court noted that there was explicit constitutional approval for laws [[disfranchisement|disenfranchising]] [[felony#United States|felons]] since section 2 of the Amendment reduced a state's representation in [[United States Congress|Congress]] if the state has denied the right to vote for any reason "except for participation in rebellion, or other crime". Thus, it was unnecessary for the statute in question to be narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests to be consistent with equal protection.&lt;ref&gt;''Richardson'', pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;
