==Overview==

The mountain range is mostly in the United States (U.S.) but it extends into southeastern [[Canada]], forming a zone from {{convert|100|to|300|mi|km|abbr=on}} wide, running from the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] {{convert|1500|mi|km|abbr=on}} southwestward to [[Central Alabama]] in the United States.{{discuss|Length of Appalachians}} The range covers parts of the islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], which comprise an overseas territory of [[France]]. The system is divided into a series of ranges, with the individual mountains averaging around {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The highest of the group is [[Mount Mitchell (North Carolina)|Mount Mitchell]] in [[North Carolina]] at {{convert|6684|ft|m|0}}, which is the highest point in the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]].

The term ''Appalachian'' refers to several different regions associated with the mountain range. Most broadly, it refers to the entire mountain range with its surrounding hills and the dissected plateau region. The term is often used more restrictively to refer to regions in the central and southern Appalachian Mountains, usually including areas in the states of [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], [[West Virginia]], and [[North Carolina]], as well as sometimes extending as far south as northern [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and western [[South Carolina]], and as far north as [[Pennsylvania]], southern [[Ohio]], and parts of southern upstate [[New York (state)|New York]].

The [[Ouachita Mountains]] in [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]] were originally part of the Appalachians as well but became disconnected through geologic history.

===Origin of the name===
[[File:Gutierrez-1562-detail-app1.jpg|thumb|Detail of Diego Gutiérrez's 1562 map of the Western Hemisphere, showing the first known use of a variation of the place name "Appalachia" ("Apalchen") – from the map ''Americae sive qvartae orbis partis nova et exactissima descriptio'']]

While exploring inland along the northern coast of Florida in 1528, the members of the [[Narváez expedition]], including [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]], found a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] village near present-day [[Tallahassee, Florida]] whose name they transcribed as ''Apalchen'' or ''Apalachen'' {{IPA-all|a.paˈla.tʃɛn|}}. The name was soon altered by the Spanish to [[Apalachee]] and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north. [[Pánfilo de Narváez]]'s expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528, and applied the name. Now spelled "Appalachian," it is the fourth-oldest surviving European place-name in the US.&lt;ref&gt;After [[Florida]], [[Cape Canaveral]], and [[Dry Tortugas]]: {{cite book |title=Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |last=Stewart|first=George |authorlink=George R. Stewart|year=1945 |publisher=Random House|location=New York |pages=11–13, 17, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|de Soto expedition]] in 1540, Spanish cartographers began to apply the name of the tribe to the mountains themselves. The first cartographic appearance of ''Apalchen'' is on [[Diego Gutiérrez (cartographer)|Diego Gutierrez]]'s map of 1562; the first use for the mountain range is the map of [[Jacques le Moyne de Morgues]] in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;Walls, David (1978), [http://www.sonoma.edu/users/w/wallsd/on-the-naming-of-appalachia.shtml "On the Naming of Appalachia"] In ''An Appalachian Symposium'', pp. 56-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name was not commonly used for the whole mountain range until the late 19th century. A competing and often more popular name was the "[[Allegheny Mountains]]", "Alleghenies", and even "Alleghania". In the early 19th century, [[Washington Irving]] proposed renaming the United States either Appalachia or Alleghania.&lt;ref&gt;[[George R. Stewart|Stewart, George R.]] (1967). ''Names on the Land''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

In U.S. dialects in the southern regions of the Appalachians, the word is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|p|ə|ˈ|l|æ|tʃ|ᵻ|n|z}}, with the third syllable sounding like "latch". In northern parts of the mountain range, it is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|p|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|tʃ|ᵻ|n|z}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|p|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|ʃ|ᵻ|n|z}}; the third syllable is like "lay", and the fourth "chins" or "shins".&lt;ref&gt;David Walls, "Appalachia". ''The Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 1006–1007.&lt;/ref&gt; There is often great debate between the residents of the regions as to which pronunciation is the more correct one. Elsewhere, a commonly accepted pronunciation for the adjective ''Appalachian'' is {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|p|ə|ˈ|l|æ|tʃ|i|ə|n}}, with the last two syllables "-ian" pronounced as in the word "Romanian".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/appalachian Define "Appalachian".] Random House Dictionary, online at Dictionary.com.

==Geography==

===Regions===
[[File:Appleorchardmountain.jpg|thumb|[[Blue Ridge Mountains]]]]
The whole system may be divided into three great sections:&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Appalachian Mountains|volume=2|pages=207–208|first=Arthur Coe|last=Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Northern'': The northern section runs from the [[Canadian province]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] to the [[Hudson River]]. It includes the [[Long Range Mountains]] and [[Annieopsquotch Mountains]] on the island of Newfoundland, [[Chic-Choc Mountains]] and [[Notre Dame Mountains|Notre Dame Range]] in Quebec and New Brunswick, scattered elevations and small ranges elsewhere in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the [[Longfellow Mountains]] in Maine, the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] in New Hampshire, the [[Green Mountains]] in Vermont, and [[The Berkshires]] in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The  [[Metacomet Ridge|Metacomet Ridge Mountains]] in Connecticut and south-central Massachusetts, although contained within the Appalachian province, is a younger system and not geologically associated with the Appalachians. The [[Monteregian Hills]], which cross the Green Mountains in Quebec, are also unassociated with the Appalachians.
* ''Central'': The central section goes from the Hudson Valley to the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] (Great Kanawha) running through Virginia and West Virginia. It comprises (excluding various minor groups) the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians|Valley Ridges]] between the [[Allegheny Front]] of the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and the [[Great Appalachian Valley]], the [[New York–New Jersey Highlands]], the [[Taconic Mountains]] in New York, and a large portion of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]].
* ''Southern'': The southern section runs from the New River onwards. It consists of the prolongation of the Blue Ridge, which is divided into the Western Blue Ridge (or Unaka) Front and the Eastern Blue Ridge Front, the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]], and the [[Cumberland Plateau]].

[[File:Greene-county-bald-mtns-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bald Mountains]]]]
The [[Adirondack Mountains]] in New York are sometimes considered part of the Appalachian chain but, geologically speaking, are a southern extension of the [[Laurentian Mountains]] of Canada.&lt;ref name=geomorph/&gt;&lt;ref name=peakbag/&gt;&lt;ref name=weidensaul/&gt;

[[File:WV plateau.jpg|right|thumb|Shaded relief map of the [[Cumberland Plateau]] and [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]] on the [[Virginia]]–[[West Virginia]] border]]

In addition to the true folded mountains, known as the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians|ridge and valley province]], the area of [[dissected plateau]] to the north and west of the mountains is usually grouped with the Appalachians. This includes the [[Catskill Mountains]] of southeastern New York, the [[The Poconos|Poconos]] in Pennsylvania, and the [[Allegheny Plateau]] of southwestern New York, western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia. This same plateau is known as the [[Cumberland Plateau]] in southern West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, western Virginia, eastern Tennessee, and northern Alabama.

The dissected plateau area, while not actually made up of geological [[mountain]]s, is popularly called "mountains," especially in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia, and while the ridges are not high, the terrain is extremely rugged. In Ohio and New York, some of the plateau has been [[Glaciated Rocks|glaciated]], which has rounded off the sharp ridges and filled the valleys to some extent. The glaciated regions are usually referred to as hill country rather than mountains.

The Appalachian region is generally considered the geographical divide between the [[East Coast of the United States|eastern seaboard]] of the United States and the [[Midwest]] region of the country. The  [[Eastern Continental Divide]] follows the Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania to Georgia.

The [[Appalachian Trail]] is a {{convert|2175|mi|km|sing=on}} hiking trail that runs all the way from [[Mount Katahdin]] in Maine to [[Springer Mountain]] in Georgia, passing over or past a large part of the Appalachian system. The [[International Appalachian Trail]] is an extension of this hiking trail into the Canadian portion of the Appalachian range in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Quebec]].

===Chief summits===
The Appalachian belt includes, with the ranges enumerated above, the plateaus sloping southward to [[Atlantic Ocean|the Atlantic Ocean]] in [[New England]], and south-eastward to the border of the [[coastal plain]] through the central and southern Atlantic states; and on the north-west, the Allegheny and Cumberland plateaus declining toward the Great Lakes and the interior plains. A remarkable feature of the belt is the longitudinal chain of broad valleys, including The [[Great Appalachian Valley]], which in the southerly sections divides the mountain system into two unequal portions, but in the northernmost lies west of all the ranges possessing typical Appalachian features, and separates them from the Adirondack group. The mountain system has no axis of dominating altitudes, but in every portion, the summits rise to rather uniform heights, and, especially in the central section, the various ridges and intermontane valleys have the same trend as the system itself. None of the summits reaches the region of perpetual snow.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[File:Appalachian fault.jpg|thumb|left|Old [[fault (geology)|fault]] exposed by roadcut near [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania|Hazleton]], [[Pennsylvania]], along [[Interstate 81]], such faults are common in the folded Appalachians]]

Mountains of the [[Long Range Mountains|Long Range]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] reach heights of nearly {{convert|2700|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}. In the [[Chic-Choc Mountains|Chic-Choc]] and [[Notre Dame Mountains|Notre Dame]] mountain ranges in Quebec, the higher summits rise above {{convert|4000|ft|m|abbr=on}} in elevation. Isolated peaks and small ranges in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]] vary from {{convert|1,000|to|2700|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}.  In [[Maine]] several peaks exceed {{convert|4000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}, including [[Mount Katahdin]] at {{convert|5267|ft}}. In [[New Hampshire]], many summits rise above {{convert|5000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}, including [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] at {{convert|6288|ft|m|abbr=on}}, [[Mount Adams (New Hampshire)|Adams]] at {{convert|5771|ft|m|abbr=on}}, [[Mount Jefferson (New Hampshire)|Jefferson]] at {{convert|5712|ft|m|abbr=on}}, [[Mount Monroe (New Hampshire)|Monroe]] at {{convert|5380|ft|m|abbr=on}}, [[Mount Madison|Madison]] at {{convert|5,367|ft|m|abbr=on}}, [[Mount Lafayette|Lafayette]] at {{convert|5249|ft|m}}, and [[Mount Lincoln (New Hampshire)|Lincoln]] at {{convert|5089|ft|m|abbr=on}}. In the [[Green Mountains]] the highest point, [[Mount Mansfield|Mt. Mansfield]], is {{convert|4393|ft|m|abbr=on}} in elevation; others include [[Killington Peak]] at {{convert|4226|ft|m|abbr=on}}, [[Camel's Hump (Vermont)|Camel's Hump]] at {{convert|4083|ft|m|abbr=on}}, [[Mount Abraham (Vermont)|Mt. Abraham]] at {{convert|4006|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and a number of other heights exceeding {{convert|3000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In Pennsylvania, there are over sixty summits that rise over {{convert|2500|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}; the summits of [[Mount Davis (Pennsylvania)|Mount Davis]] and [[Blue Knob]] rise over {{convert|3000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}. In Maryland, Eagle Rock and [[Dans Mountain]] are conspicuous points reaching {{convert|3162|ft|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2882|ft|m|abbr=on}} respectively. On the same side of the Great Valley, south of the Potomac, are the Pinnacle {{convert|3007|ft}} and Pidgeon Roost {{convert|3400|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In [[West Virginia]], more than 150 peaks rise above {{convert|4000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}, including [[Spruce Knob]] {{convert|4863|ft|abbr=on}}, the highest point in the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. A number of other points in the state rise above {{convert|4800|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}. [[Snowshoe Mountain]] at Thorny Flat {{convert|4848|ft|abbr=on}} and [[Bald Knob]] {{convert|4842|ft|abbr=on}} are among the more notable peaks in West Virginia.

[[File:Cliffs above Gauley-27527.jpg|thumb|right|Cliffs overlooking the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] near [[Gauley Bridge, West Virginia|Gauley Bridge]], [[West Virginia]]]]

The [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], rising in southern [[Pennsylvania]] and there known as [[South Mountain (Maryland and Pennsylvania)|South Mountain]], attain elevations of about {{convert|2000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} in that state.  South Mountain achieves its highest point just below the [[Mason-Dixon]] line in Maryland at [[Quirauk Mountain]] {{convert|2145|ft|abbr=on}} and then diminishes in height southward to the [[Potomac River]]. Once in Virginia the Blue Ridge again reaches {{convert|2000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} and higher. In the [[Virginia]] Blue Ridge, the following are some of the highest peaks north of the [[Roanoke River]]: Stony Man {{convert|4031|ft|abbr=on}}, [[Hawksbill Mountain]] {{convert|4066|ft|abbr=on}}, [[Apple Orchard Mountain]] {{convert|4,225|ft|abbr=on}} and [[Peaks of Otter]] {{convert|4001|and|3875|ft|abbr=on}}.  South of the Roanoke River, along the Blue Ridge, are Virginia's highest peaks including [[Whitetop Mountain]] {{convert|5520|ft|abbr=on}} and [[Mount Rogers]] {{convert|5729|ft|abbr=on}}, the highest point in the Commonwealth.

Chief summits in the southern section of the Blue Ridge are located along two main crests—the Western or Unaka Front along the Tennessee-North Carolina border and the Eastern Front in North Carolina—or one of several "cross ridges" between the two main crests. Major subranges of the Eastern Front include the [[Black Mountains (North Carolina)|Black Mountains]], [[Great Craggy Mountains]], and [[Great Balsam Mountains]], and its chief summits include [[Grandfather Mountain]] {{convert|5964|ft|m|abbr=on}} near the Tennessee-North Carolina border, [[Mount Mitchell]] {{convert|6684|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the Blacks, and [[Black Balsam Knob]] {{convert|6214|ft|m|abbr=on}} and [[Cold Mountain (North Carolina)|Cold Mountain]] {{convert|6030|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the Great Balsams.  The Western Blue Ridge Front is subdivided into the [[Unaka Range]], the [[Bald Mountains]], the [[Great Smoky Mountains]], and the [[Unicoi Mountains]], and its major peaks include [[Roan Mountain (Roan Highlands)|Roan Mountain]] {{convert|6285|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the Unakas, Big Bald {{convert|5516|ft|m|abbr=on}} and [[Max Patch]] {{convert|4616|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the Bald Mountains, [[Clingmans Dome]] {{convert|6643|ft|m|abbr=on}}, [[Mount Le Conte (Tennessee)|Mount Le Conte]] {{convert|6593|ft|m}}, and [[Mount Guyot (Great Smoky Mountains)|Mount Guyot]] {{convert|6621|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the Great Smokies, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] {{convert|4224|ft|m|abbr=on}} near the Tennessee-Georgia-North Carolina border. Prominent summits in the cross ridges include [[Waterrock Knob]] ({{convert|6292|ft|m|abbr=on}}) in the [[Plott Balsams]].

There are many geological issues concerning the rivers and streams of the Appalachians. In spite of the existence of the Great Appalachian Valley, many of the main rivers are transverse to the mountain system axis. The [[drainage divide]] of the Appalachians follows a tortuous course which crosses the mountainous belt just north of the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] in Virginia. South of the New River, rivers head into the Blue Ridge, cross the higher Unakas, receive important tributaries from the Great Valley, and traversing the Cumberland Plateau in spreading gorges ([[water gap]]s), escape by way of the [[Cumberland River]] and the [[Tennessee River]] rivers to the [[Ohio River]] and the [[Mississippi River]], and thence to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In the central section, north of the New River, the rivers, rising in or just beyond the Valley Ridges, flow through great gorges to the Great Valley, and then across the Blue Ridge to tidal estuaries penetrating the coastal plain via the Roanoke River, [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], [[Potomac River]], and [[Susquehanna River]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In the northern section the height of land lies on the inland side of the mountainous belt, and thus the main lines of drainage run from north to south, exemplified by the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; However, the valley through which the Hudson River flows was cut by the gigantic [[glacier]]s of the [[Ice Age]]s—the same glaciers that deposited their [[terminal moraine]]s in southern New York and formed the east-west [[Long Island]].

[[File:Appalachian map.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] Appalachian zones in the United States]]
A look at rocks exposed in today's Appalachian mountains reveals elongated belts of folded and thrust [[Fault (geology)|faulted]] marine [[sedimentary rock]]s, [[volcanic rock]]s and slivers of ancient ocean floor, which provides strong evidence that these rocks were deformed during plate collision. The birth of the Appalachian ranges, some 480&amp;nbsp;Ma, marks the first of several mountain-building plate collisions that culminated in the construction of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] with the Appalachians near the center. Because North America and Africa were connected, the Appalachians formed part of the same mountain chain as the  [[Little Atlas]] in [[Morocco]]. This mountain range, known as the [[Central Pangean Mountains]], extended into [[Scotland]], before the Mesozoic Era opening of the Iapetus Ocean, from the North America/Europe collision (See  [[Caledonian orogeny]]).

During the middle [[Ordovician Period]] (about 496–440&amp;nbsp;Ma), a change in plate motions set the stage for the first Paleozoic mountain-building event ([[Taconic orogeny]]) in [[North America]]. The once-quiet Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate, the [[Iapetus Ocean|Iapetus]], collided with and began sinking beneath the [[North American craton]]. With the birth of this new [[subduction]] zone, the early Appalachians were born. Along the continental margin, volcanoes grew, coincident with the initiation of subduction. Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin. As the mountains rose, erosion began to wear them down. Streams carried rock debris downslope to be deposited in nearby lowlands. The Taconic Orogeny was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians, culminating in the collision of North America and Africa (see [[Alleghanian orogeny]]).&lt;ref name="usgs"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=USGS|url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/province/appalach.html|title=Geologic Provinces of the United States: Appalachian Highlands Province|accessdate=July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the [[Mesozoic]] Era, the Appalachian Mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain.&lt;ref name="usgs"/&gt; It was not until the region was uplifted during the [[Cenozoic Era]] that the distinctive topography of the present formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=C.

Some streams flowed along weak layers that define the folds and faults created many millions of years earlier. Other streams [[downcutting|downcut]] so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core, carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures.

===Mineral resources===
The Appalachian Mountains contain major deposits of [[anthracite]] [[coal]] as well as [[bituminous coal]]. In the folded mountains the coal is in metamorphosed form as anthracite, represented by the [[Coal Region]] of [[northeastern Pennsylvania]]. The bituminous coal fields of [[western Pennsylvania]], [[western Maryland]], southeastern Ohio, eastern Kentucky, [[Southwest Virginia|southwestern Virginia]], and West Virginia contain the sedimentary form of coal.&lt;ref name=coal&gt;{{cite web|publisher=USGS|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1625c/CHAPTER_A/CHAPTER_A.pdf|title=Executive Summary—Coal Resource Assessment of Selected Coal Beds and Zones in the Northern and Central Appalachian Basin Coal Regions|first=Leslie F.|last=Ruppert|accessdate=July 19, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715045305/http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1625c/CHAPTER_A/CHAPTER_A.pdf|archivedate=July 15, 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  [[mountain top removal]] method of [[coal mining]], in which entire mountain tops are removed, is currently threatening vast areas and ecosystems of the Appalachian Mountain region.&lt;ref name="Palmer et al 2010"/&gt;

===Flora===

The floras of the Appalachians are diverse and vary primarily in response to geology, latitude, elevation and moisture availability. Geobotanically, they constitute a [[floristic province]] of the [[North American Atlantic Region]]. The Appalachians consist primarily of deciduous broad-leaf trees and evergreen needle-leaf conifers, but also contain the evergreen broad-leaf [[American holly]] (''{{lang|la|Ilex opaca}}''), and the deciduous needle-leaf conifer, the [[Tamarack larch|tamarack]], or eastern larch (''{{lang|la|Larix laricina}}'').

The dominant northern and high elevation conifer is the [[red spruce]] (''{{lang|la|Picea rubens}}''), which grows from near sea level to above {{convert|4000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (asl) in northern [[New England]] and southeastern Canada. It also grows southward along the Appalachian crest to the highest elevations of the southern Appalachians, as in [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]]. In the central Appalachians it is usually confined above {{convert|3000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} asl, except for a few cold valleys in which it reaches lower elevations. In the southern Appalachians, it is restricted to higher elevations. Another species is the [[black spruce]] (''{{lang|la|Picea mariana}}''), which extends farthest north of any conifer in North America, is found at high elevations in the northern Appalachians, and in bogs as far south as Pennsylvania.

The Appalachians are also home to two species of fir, the boreal [[balsam fir]] (''{{lang|la|Abies balsamea}}''), and the southern high elevation endemic, [[Fraser fir]] (''{{lang|la|Abies fraseri}}'').  Fraser fir is confined to the highest parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains, where along with red spruce it forms a fragile ecosystem known as the [[Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest]].  Fraser fir rarely occurs below {{convert|5500|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}, and becomes the dominant tree type at {{convert|6200|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rose Houk, ''Great Smoky Mountains National Park: A Natural History Guide'' (Boston: Houghton-Mifflin, 1993), pp. 50-62.&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, balsam fir is found from near sea level to the tree line in the northern Appalachians, but ranges only as far south as Virginia and West Virginia in the central Appalachians, where it is usually confined above {{convert|3900|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} asl, except in cold valleys. Curiously, it is associated with oaks in Virginia. The balsam fir of Virginia and West Virginia is thought by some to be a natural hybrid between the more northern variety and Fraser fir. While red spruce is common in both upland and bog habitats, balsam fir, as well as black spruce and tamarack, are more characteristic of the latter. However balsam fir also does well in soils with a pH as high as 6.&lt;ref&gt;Fowells, H.A., 1965, ''Silvics of Forest Trees of the United States'', Agricultural Handbook No. 271, [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Dept. of Agriculture]], Forest Service, Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rockytop and Patterson Ridges (13083210443).jpg|thumb|[[Shenandoah National Park]]]]

[[Eastern hemlock|Eastern or Canada hemlock]] (''{{lang|la|Tsuga canadensis}}'') is another important evergreen needle-leaf conifer that grows along the Appalachian chain from north to south but is confined to lower elevations than red spruce and the firs. It generally occupies richer and less acidic soils than the spruce and firs and is characteristic of deep, shaded and moist mountain valleys and [[cove (Appalachian Mountains)|cove]]s. It is, unfortunately, subject to the [[hemlock woolly adelgid]] (''{{lang|la|Adelges tsugae}}''), an introduced insect, that is rapidly extirpating it as a forest tree. Less abundant, and restricted to the southern Appalachians, is [[Carolina hemlock]] (''{{lang|la|Tsuga caroliniana}}''). Like Canada hemlock, this tree suffers severely from the hemlock woolly adelgid.

Several species of pines characteristic of the Appalachians are [[eastern white pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus strobus }}''), [[Virginia pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus virginiana}}''), [[pitch pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus rigida }}''), [[Table Mountain pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus pungens}}'') and [[shortleaf pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus echinata}}''). [[Red pine]] (''{{lang|la|Pinus resinosa}}'') is a boreal species that forms a few high elevation outliers as far south as West Virginia. All of these species except white pine tend to occupy sandy, rocky, poor soil sites, which are mostly acidic in character. White pine, a large species valued for its timber, tends to do best in rich, moist soil, either acidic or alkaline in character. Pitch pine is also at home in acidic, boggy soil, and Table Mountain pine may occasionally be found in this habitat as well. Shortleaf pine is generally found in warmer habitats and at lower elevations than the other species. All the species listed do best in open or lightly shaded habitats, although white pine also thrives in shady coves, valleys, and on floodplains.
[[File:Craggy Gardens-27527.jpg|thumb|left|The view from Craggy Gardens on the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]]]]
The Appalachians are characterized by a wealth of large, beautiful deciduous broadleaf (hardwood) trees. Their occurrences are best summarized and described in [[Emma Lucy Braun|E. Lucy Braun]]'s 1950 classic, ''Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America'' (Macmillan, New York). The most diverse and richest forests are the mixed mesophytic or medium moisture types, which are largely confined to rich, moist montane soils of the southern and central Appalachians, particularly in the Cumberland and Allegheny Mountains, but also thrive in the southern Appalachian coves. Characteristic canopy species are [[Tilia heterophylla|white basswood]] (''{{lang|la|Tilia heterophylla}}''), [[yellow buckeye]] (''{{lang|la|Aesculus octandra}}''), [[sugar maple]] (''{{lang|la|Acer saccharum}}''), [[American beech]] (''{{lang|la|Fagus grandifolia}}''), [[tuliptree]] (''{{lang|la|Liriodendron tulipifera}}''), [[Fraxinus americana|white ash]] (''{{lang|la|Fraxinus americana }}'') and [[yellow birch]] (''{{lang|la|Betula alleganiensis}}''). Other common trees are [[red maple]] (''{{lang|la|Acer rubrum}}''), [[Shagbark hickory|shagbark]] and [[Bitternut hickory|bitternut]] hickories (''{{lang|la|Carya ovata and C. cordiformis}}'') and [[Sweet birch|black or sweet birch]] (''{{lang|la|Betula lenta }}''). Small understory trees and shrubs include [[flowering dogwood]] (''{{lang|la|Cornus florida}}''), [[hophornbeam]] (''{{lang|la|Ostrya virginiana}}''), [[witch-hazel]] (''{{lang|la|Hamamelis virginiana}}'') and [[Lindera|spicebush]] (''{{lang|la|Lindera benzoin}}''). There are also hundreds of perennial and annual herbs, among them such herbal and medicinal plants as American [[ginseng]] (''{{lang|la|Panax quinquefolius}}''), [[goldenseal]] (''{{lang|la|Hydrastis canadensis}}''), [[bloodroot]] (''{{lang|la|Sanguinaria canadensis}}'') and [[black cohosh]] (''{{lang|la|Cimicifuga racemosa}}'').

The foregoing trees, shrubs, and herbs are also more widely distributed in less rich [[mesic habitat|mesic]] forests that generally occupy coves, stream valleys and [[flood plain]]s throughout the southern and central Appalachians at low and intermediate elevations. In the northern Appalachians and at higher elevations of the central and southern Appalachians these diverse mesic forests give way to less diverse "northern hardwoods" with canopies dominated only by American beech, sugar maple, [[American basswood]] (''{{lang|la|Tilia americana}}'') and yellow birch and with far fewer species of shrubs and herbs.

Dryer and rockier uplands and ridges are occupied by oak-chestnut type forests dominated by a variety of oaks (''{{lang|la|Quercus}}'' spp.), [[hickory|hickories]] (''{{lang|la|Carya}}'' spp.) and, in the past, by the [[American chestnut]] (''{{lang|la|Castanea dentata}}''). The American chestnut was virtually eliminated as a canopy species by the introduced fungal [[chestnut blight]] (''{{lang|la|Cryphonectaria parasitica}}''), but lives on as sapling-sized sprouts that originate from roots, which are not killed by the fungus. In present-day forest canopies, chestnut has been largely replaced by oaks.

The oak forests of the southern and central Appalachians consist largely of [[Quercus velutina|black]], [[Northern red oak|northern red]], [[White oak|white]], [[Chestnut oak|chestnut]] and [[scarlet oak]]s (''{{lang|la|Quercus velutina, Q. rubra, Q. alba, Q. prinus}} and {{lang|la|Q. coccinea}}'') and hickories, such as the pignut (''{{lang|la|Carya glabra}}'') in particular. The richest forests, which grade into mesic types, usually in coves and on gentle slopes, have dominantly white and northern red oaks, while the driest sites are dominated by chestnut oak, or sometimes by scarlet or northern red oaks. In the northern Appalachians the oaks, except for white and northern red, drop out, while the latter extends farthest north.
[[File:Rhododendron maximum-27527.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rhododendron maximum|Great laurel]] thicket in the [[Pisgah National Forest]]]]
The oak forests generally lack the diverse small tree, shrub and herb layers of mesic forests. Shrubs are generally ericaceous, and include the evergreen [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] (''{{lang|la|Kalmia latifolia}}''), various species of [[blueberry|blueberries]] (''{{lang|la|Vaccinium}}'' spp.), [[Gaylussacia baccata|black huckleberry]] (''{{lang|la|Gaylussacia baccata}}''), a number of deciduous [[rhododendron]]s (azaleas), and smaller heaths such as [[teaberry]] (''{{lang|la|Gaultheria procumbens}}'') and [[trailing arbutus]] (''{{lang|la|Epigaea repens }}''). The evergreen great rhododendron (''{{lang|la|Rhododendron maximum}}'') is characteristic of moist stream valleys. These occurrences are in line with the prevailing acidic character of most oak forest soils. In contrast, the much rarer [[chinquapin oak]] (''{{lang|la|Quercus muehlenbergii}}'') demands alkaline soils and generally grows where limestone rock is near the surface. Hence no ericaceous shrubs are associated with it.

The Appalachian floras also include a diverse assemblage of [[bryophyte]]s (mosses and liverworts), as well as [[fungi]]. Some species are rare and/or endemic. As with [[vascular plant]]s, these tend to be closely related to the character of the soils and thermal environment in which they are found.

Eastern deciduous forests are subject to a number of serious insect and disease outbreaks. Among the most conspicuous is that of the introduced [[gypsy moth]]  (''{{lang|la|Lymantria dispar}}''), which infests primarily oaks, causing severe defoliation and tree mortality. But it also has the benefit of eliminating weak individuals, and thus improving the genetic stock, as well as creating rich habitat of a type through accumulation of dead wood. Because hardwoods sprout so readily, this moth is not as harmful as the [[hemlock woolly adelgid]]. Perhaps more serious is the introduced [[beech bark disease]] complex, which includes both a scale insect (''{{lang|la|Cryptococcus fagisuga}}'') and fungal components.

[[File:Cranberry-glades-fog-1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|[[Cranberry Glades]], a bog preserve in West Virginia]]
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Appalachian forests were subject to severe and destructive logging and land clearing, which resulted in the designation of the national forests and parks as well many state protected areas. However, these and a variety of other destructive activities continue, albeit in diminished forms; and thus far only a few ecologically based management practices have taken hold.

[[Appalachian bogs]] are [[boreal ecosystem]]s, which occur in many places in the Appalachians, particularly the [[Allegheny Mountains|Allegheny]] and [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]] subranges.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fws.gov/southeast/pubs/mtbog.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fws.gov/refuge/mountain_bogs/&lt;/ref&gt; Though popularly called [[bog]]s, many of them are technically [[fen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF0QNPA8IsM&amp;index=32&amp;list=PLnN7OGI1bJ88pzzjPYF-U6pgYTwj_8nHe&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
Animals that characterize the Appalachian forests include five species of [[tree squirrel]]s. The most commonly seen is the low to moderate elevation [[eastern gray squirrel]] (''{{lang|la|Sciurus carolinensis}}''). Occupying similar habitat is the slightly larger [[fox squirrel]] (''{{lang|la|Sciurus niger}}'') and the much smaller [[southern flying squirrel]] (''{{lang|la|Glaucomys volans}}''). More characteristic of cooler northern and high elevation habitat is the [[American red squirrel|red squirrel]] (''{{lang|la|Tamiasciurus hudsonicus}}''), whereas the Appalachian [[northern flying squirrel]] (''{{lang|la|Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus}}''), which closely resembles the southern flying squirrel, is confined to northern hardwood and spruce-fir forests.

[[File:Southern Flying Squirrel-27527-3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Southern flying squirrel]]]]

As familiar as squirrels are the [[eastern cottontail]] rabbit (''{{lang|la|Silvilagus floridanus}}'') and the [[white-tailed deer]] (''{{lang|la|Odocoileus virginianus}}''). The latter in particular has greatly increased in abundance as a result of the extirpation of the [[eastern wolf]] (''{{lang|la|Canis lupus lycaon}}'') and the [[North American cougar|cougar]]. This has led to the overgrazing and browsing of many plants of the Appalachian forests, as well as destruction of agricultural crops. Other deer include the [[eastern moose|moose]] (''{{lang|la|Alces alces }}''), found only in the north, and the [[elk]] (''{{lang|la|Cervus canadensis}}''), which, although once [[Eastern elk|extirpated]], is now making a comeback, through transplantation, in the southern and central Appalachians. In [[Quebec]], the Chic-Chocs host the only population of [[caribou]] (''{{lang|la|Rangifer tarandus}}'') south of the [[St. Lawrence River]]. An additional species that is common in the north but extends its range southward at high elevations to Virginia and West Virginia is the varying of [[snowshoe hare]] (''{{lang|la|Lepus americanus}}'').  However, these central Appalachian populations are scattered and very small.

Another species of great interest is the [[North American beaver|beaver]] (''{{lang|la|Castor canadensis}}''), which is showing a great resurgence in numbers after its near extirpation for its pelt. This resurgence is bringing about a drastic alteration in habitat through the construction of dams and other structures throughout the mountains.

Other common forest animals are the [[American black bear|black bear]] (''{{lang|la|Ursus americanus}}''), [[striped skunk]] (''{{lang|la|Mephitis mephitis}}''), [[raccoon]] (''{{lang|la|Procyon lotor}}''), [[groundhog|woodchuck]] (''{{lang|la|Marmota monax}}''), [[bobcat]] (''{{lang|la|Lynx rufus}}''), [[gray fox]] (''{{lang|la|Urocyon cinereoargenteus}}''), [[red fox]] (''{{lang|la|Vulpes vulpes}}'') and in recent years, the [[coyote]] (''{{lang|la|Canis latrans}}''), another species favored by the advent of Europeans and the extirpation of eastern and [[red wolf|red wolves]]. European [[boar]]s were introduced in the early 20th century.

Characteristic birds of the forest are [[wild turkey]] (''{{lang|la|Meleagris gallopavo silvestris}}''), [[ruffed grouse]] (''{{lang|la|Bonasa umbellus}}''), [[mourning dove]] (''{{lang|la|Zenaida macroura}}''), [[common raven]] (''{{lang|la|Corvus corax}}''), [[wood duck]] (''{{lang|la|Aix sponsa}}''), [[great horned owl]] (''{{lang|la|Bubo virginianus}}''), [[barred owl]] (''{{lang|la|Strix varia}}''), [[Scops owl|screech owl]] (''{{lang|la|Megascops asio}}''), [[red-tailed hawk]] (''{{lang|la|Buteo jamaicensis}}''), [[red-shouldered hawk]] (''{{lang|la|Buteo lineatus}}''), and [[northern goshawk]] (''{{lang|la|Accipiter gentilis}}''), as well as a great variety of "songbirds" ([[Passeriformes]]), like the warblers in particular.

[[File:Wild Turkey-27527-1.jpg|thumb|right|Male [[Wild turkey|eastern wild turkey]]]]

Of great importance are the many species of [[salamander]]s and, in particular, the [[lungless salamander|lungless]] species (Family ''{{lang|la|Plethodontidae}}'') that live in great abundance concealed by leaves and debris, on the forest floor. Most frequently seen, however, is the [[Eastern newt|eastern or red-spotted newt]] (''{{lang|la|Notophthalmus viridescens}}''), whose terrestrial eft form is often encountered on the open, dry forest floor.  It has been estimated that salamanders represent the largest class of animal biomass in the Appalachian forests. Frogs and toads are of lesser diversity and abundance, but the [[wood frog]] (''{{lang|la|Rana sylvatica}}'') is, like the eft, commonly encountered on the dry forest floor, while a number of species of small frogs, such as [[spring peeper]]s (''{{lang|la|Pseudacris crucifer}}''), enliven the forest with their calls. Salamanders and other amphibians contribute greatly to nutrient cycling through their consumption of small life forms on the forest floor and in aquatic habitats.

Although reptiles are less abundant and diverse than amphibians, a number of snakes are conspicuous members of the fauna. One of the largest is the non-venomous [[black rat snake]] (''{{lang|la|Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta}}''), while the [[common garter snake]] (''{{lang|la|Thamnophis sirtalis}}'') is among the smallest but most abundant. The [[American copperhead]] (''{{lang|la|Agkistrodon contortrix}}'') and the [[timber rattler]] (''{{lang|la|Crotalus horridus}}'') are venomous [[pit viper]]s. There are few lizards, but the [[broad-headed skink]] (''{{lang|la|Eumeces laticeps}}''), at up to {{convert|13|in|cm|abbr=on}} in length, and an excellent climber and swimmer, is one of the largest and most spectacular in appearance and action. The most common turtle is the [[eastern box turtle]] (''{{lang|la|Terrapene carolina carolina}}''), which is found in both upland and lowland forests in the central and southern Appalachians. Prominent among aquatic species is the large [[common snapping turtle]] (''{{lang|la|Chelydra serpentina}}''), which occurs throughout the Appalachians.

Appalachian streams are notable for their highly diverse freshwater fish life. Among the most abundant and diverse are those of the minnow family (family [[Cyprinidae]]), while species of the colorful [[Darter (fish)|darters]] (''{{lang|la|Percina}}'' spp.) are also abundant.&lt;ref&gt;Page, Lawrence M. and Brooks M. Burr 1991, ''A Field Guide to Freshwater Fishes, North America, North of Mexico'', Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston&lt;/ref&gt;

A characteristic fish of shaded, cool Appalachian forest streams is the [[Brook trout|wild brook or speckled trout]] (''{{lang|la|Salvelinus fontinalis}}''), which is much sought after as a game fish. However, in past years such trout waters have been much degraded by increasing temperatures due to timber cutting, pollution from various sources and potentially, [[global warming]].

The '''Baltic Plate''' was an ancient [[tectonic plate]] that existed from the [[Cambrian|Cambrian Period]] to the [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous Period]]. The Baltic Plate collided against [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]], to form the [[Ural Mountains]] about 280 million years ago. The Baltic Plate, however, fused onto the [[Eurasian Plate]] when the Baltic Plate collided against Siberia when the Ural Mountains were completely formed. The Baltic Plate contained [[Baltica]] and the [[Baltic Shield]] which is now located in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]].

A '''capital city''' (or simply '''capital''') is the [[municipality]] exercising primary status in a [[country]], [[state (subnational entity)|state]], [[province]], or other [[administrative region]], usually as its [[seat of government]].  A capital is typically a [[city]] that physically encompasses the government's offices and meeting places; the status as capital is often designated by its law or [[constitution]]. In some [[jurisdiction]]s, including several countries, the different branches of government are located in different settlements. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official ([[Constitution|constitutional]]) capital and the seat of government, which is [[List of countries with multiple capitals|in another place]].

Capital cities that are also the prime economic, cultural, or intellectual centres of a nation or an empire are sometimes referred to as [[Primate city|primate cities]]. Examples are [[Athens]], [[Bangkok]], [[Brussels]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Cairo]], [[London]], [[Mexico City]], [[Paris]], [[Seoul]] and [[Tokyo]].

News media will often use the name of a capital city as an alternative name for the country of which it is the capital or of the government that is seated there, as a form of [[metonymy]]. For example, "relations between Washington and London" refer to "[[United Kingdom–United States relations|relations]] between the United States and the United Kingdom".

== Terminology ==
The word ''capital'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''caput'' (genitive ''capitis''), meaning "[[head]]".

In several English-speaking states, the terms [[county town]] and [[county seat]] are also used in [[Subnational|lower]] subdivisions. In some [[unitary state]]s, subnational capitals may be known as "administrative centres".  The capital is often the [[List of capitals and largest cities by country|largest city]] of its constituent, though not always.

== Origins ==
[[File:Tavares.Forum.Romanum.redux.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Roman Forum]] was surrounded by many government buildings as the capital of [[Ancient Rome]].]]
Historically, the major economic centre of a state or region often becomes the focal point of political power, and becomes a capital through [[Conquest (military)|conquest]] or [[federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinooze.com/what-does-a-capital-city-mean/|title=What does a Capital City Mean?|date=5 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531161615/http://kinooze.com/what-does-a-capital-city-mean/|archivedate=31 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The modern capital city has, however, not always existed: in medieval Western Europe, an [[itinerant court|itinerant (wandering) government]] was common.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/capital-city-relocation-1435389|title=Where Next: The Reasons Why (Some) Countries Move Their Capitals|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010151019/https://www.thoughtco.com/capital-city-relocation-1435389|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are [[Babylon|Ancient Babylon]], [[Baghdad#History|Abbasid Baghdad]], [[Ancient Athens]], [[Rome]], [[Constantinople]], [[Chang'an]], [[Cusco|Ancient Cusco]], [[Madrid]], [[Paris]], [[London]], [[Moscow]], [[Beijing]], [[Tokyo]], [[Vienna]], [[Lisbon]] and [[Berlin]]. The capital city naturally attracts politically motivated people and those whose skills are needed for efficient [[Administration (government)|administration]] of national or imperial governments, such as [[lawyer]]s, [[political scientist]]s, [[banking|banker]]s, [[journalist]]s, and [[public policy (law)|public policy maker]]s. Some of these cities are or were also [[Holy city|religious centres]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=M_aMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=religious+centres+capital+cities&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VEfFJF9hdI&amp;sig=PtLmMxFTErkNm-Qor7fGibCfr6g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirz6OC3rDUAhVIVbwKHWM_B_AQ6AEITTAL#v=onepage&amp;q=religious+centres+capital+cities&amp;f=false|title=Capital Cities in the Aftermath of Empires: Planning in Central and Southeastern Europe|first1=Emily Gunzburger|last1=Makas|first2=Tanja Damljanovic|last2=Conley|date=4 December 2009|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=9 June 2017|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010151840/https://books.google.com.au/books?id=M_aMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=religious+centres+capital+cities&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VEfFJF9hdI&amp;sig=PtLmMxFTErkNm-Qor7fGibCfr6g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirz6OC3rDUAhVIVbwKHWM_B_AQ6AEITTAL#v=onepage&amp;q=religious+centres+capital+cities&amp;f=false|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. [[Constantinople]] (more than one religion), Rome (the [[Roman Catholic Church]]), [[Jerusalem]] (more than one religion), [[Babylon|Ancient Babylon]], Moscow (the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]), Belgrade (the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]), Paris, and [[Peking]].

The convergence of political and economic or cultural power is by no means universal. Traditional capitals may be economically eclipsed by provincial rivals, e.g. [[Nanking]] by [[Shanghai]], [[Quebec City]] by [[Montreal]], and numerous [[US state capitals]]. The [[societal collapse|decline]] of a dynasty or culture could also mean the extinction of its capital city, as occurred at [[Babylon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=6Cl4BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=extinction+babylon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hoHWZ95wMC&amp;sig=Q12hEn29qFcbg6YrAtc84Xts-1g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjk05-P37DUAhWCgLwKHbIcBOsQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=extinction+babylon&amp;f=false|title=Babylon: Legend, History and the Ancient City|first=Michael|last=Seymour|date=29 August 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|accessdate=9 June 2017|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010153333/https://books.google.com.au/books?id=6Cl4BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=extinction+babylon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hoHWZ95wMC&amp;sig=Q12hEn29qFcbg6YrAtc84Xts-1g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjk05-P37DUAhWCgLwKHbIcBOsQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=extinction+babylon&amp;f=false|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cahokia]].

Although many capitals are defined by constitution or legislation, many long-time capitals have no legal designation as such: for example [[Bern]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Lisbon]], [[London]], [[Paris]], and [[Wellington]]. They are recognised as capitals as a matter of convention, and because all or almost all the country's central political institutions, such as government departments, supreme court, legislature, embassies, etc., are located in or near them.

[[Counties of the United Kingdom|Counties]] in the [[United Kingdom]] have historic county towns, which are often not the largest settlement within the county and often are no longer administrative centres, as many historical counties are now only ceremonial, and administrative boundaries are different.

In [[Canada]], there is a [[Ottawa|federal capital]], while the ten [[provinces of Canada|provinces]] and three [[Territories of Canada#Territories|territories]] all have capital cities. The states of such countries as [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]] (including the famous cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[São Paulo]], capitals of their respective states), and [[Australia]] all have capital cities. For example, the six state capitals of Australia are [[Adelaide]]; [[Brisbane]]; [[Hobart]]; [[Melbourne]]; [[Perth]]; and [[Sydney]]. In Australia, the term "capital cities" is regularly used to refer to the aforementioned state capitals plus the federal capital [[Canberra]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], the capital of the [[Northern Territory]]. [[Abu Dhabi]] is the capital city of the [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] overall.

In unitary states which consist of multiple constituent nations, such as the [[United Kingdom]] or the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], each will usually have its own capital city. Unlike in [[Federation|federations]], there is usually not a separate national capital, but rather the capital city of one constituent nation will also be the capital of the state overall, such as [[London]], which is the capital of [[England]] and the United Kingdom. Similarly, each of the [[autonomous communities of Spain]] and [[regions of Italy]] has a capital city, such as [[Seville]] or [[Naples]], while [[Madrid]] is the capital of the [[Community of Madrid]] and the [[Kingdom of Spain]] as a whole and [[Rome]] is the capital of [[Italy]] and the region of [[Lazio]].

In the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], each of its constituent [[Federated state|state]]s (or [[States of Germany|''Länder'']] - plural of ''Land'') has its own capital city, such as [[Dresden]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Mainz]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Stuttgart]], and [[Munich]], as do all of the republics of the [[Russian Federation]]. The national capitals of Germany and Russia: the [[City-state#Non-sovereign city-states|Stadtstaat]] of [[Berlin]] and the [[Federal cities of Russia|Federal City]] of [[Moscow]], are also constituent states of both countries in their own right. Each of the [[States of Austria]] and [[Cantons of Switzerland]] also have their own capital cities. [[Vienna]], the national capital of [[Austria]], is also one of the states, while [[Bern]] is the (''de facto'') capital of both [[Switzerland]] and the [[Canton of Bern]].

Many national capitals are also the largest city in their respective countries, but in many countries this is not the case.

== Planned capitals ==
[[File:L'Enfant plan.jpg|thumb|The [[L'Enfant Plan]] for [[Washington, D.C.]], the capital of the [[United States]]]]
Governing entities sometimes plan, design and build new capital cities to house the seat of government of a [[polity]] or of a subdivision. Deliberately [[List of purpose-built national capitals|planned and designed capitals]] include:
* [[Gaborone]], [[Botswana]] (1964)
* [[La Plata]], [[Buenos Aires Province]], [[Argentina]]
* [[Abuja]], Nigeria (1991)
* [[Aracaju]], Sergipe, Brazil (1855)
* [[Amaravati]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], India (2016)
* [[Ankara]], Turkey (1923)
* [[Astana]], Kazakhstan (1997)
* [[Austin, Texas]], USA (1839)
* [[Belmopan]], Belize (1970)
* [[Belo Horizonte]], Minas Gerais, Brazil (1897)
* [[Brasília]], Brazil (1960)
* [[Bhubaneswar]], Odisha, India (1948)
* [[Bireuen]], [[Aceh]], [[Indonesia]] (1948)
* [[Bukittinggi]], [[West Sumatra]], Indonesia (1948)
* [[Constantinople]], Roman Empire (324-330)
* [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh (1971)
* [[Canberra]], Australia (1927)
* [[Chandigarh]], Punjab and Haryana, India (1966)
* [[Gandhinagar]], Gujarat, India (1960)
* [[Goiânia]], Goiás, Brazil (1933)
* [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, USA (1825)
* [[Islamabad]], Pakistan (1960)
* [[Frankfort, Kentucky]], USA (1792)
* [[Jefferson City, Missouri]], USA (1821)
* [[Naypyidaw]], Burma (2005-2006)
* [[New Delhi]], India (1911)
* [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma, USA (1889)
* [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada (1857)
* [[Palmas, Tocantins|Palmas]], Tocantins, Brazil (1989)
* [[Quezon City]], Philippines (1948–76)
* [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], USA (1792)
* [[Valletta]], Malta (1571)
* [[Washington, D.C.]], USA (1800)
* [[Wellington]], New Zealand (moved in 1865)
* [[Yogyakarta]], Indonesia (1946)

These cities satisfy one or both of the following criteria:

# A deliberately [[planned city]] that was built expressly to house the [[seat of government]], superseding a capital city that was in an established [[Center of population|population center]]. There have been various reasons for this, including overcrowding in that major metropolitan area, and the desire to place the capital city in a location with a better climate (usually a less tropical one).
# A town that was chosen as a compromise among two or more cities (or other political divisions), none of which was willing to concede to the other(s) the privilege of being the capital city. Usually, the new capital is geographically located roughly equidistant between the competing population centres.

[[File:Parliamenthouse2.jpg|thumb|The [[Australian Parliament]] opened in the small town of [[Canberra]] in 1927 as a compromise between the largest cities, [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]].]]
Some examples of the second situation (compromise locations) include:
* [[Canberra]], Australia, chosen as a compromise located between Melbourne and Sydney.
*[[Washington, D.C.]], United States, founded as a compromise between more urbanized [[Northern United States|Northern states]] and agrarian [[Southern United States|Southern]] "[[Slave states and free states|slave states]]" to share national power. This is called the [[Compromise of 1790]], resulting in the passage of the [[Residence Act]], which approved the creation of a national capital on the [[Potomac River]] on land ceded from [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Crew124"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Q81AAAAIAAJ|title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.C.|last=Crew|first=Harvey W.|last2=Webb|first2=William Bensing|last3=Wooldridge|first3=John|publisher=United Brethren Publishing House|year=1892|location=Dayton, OH|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Frankfort, Kentucky]], midway between [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and [[Lexington, Kentucky]].
* [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada, located along the boundary between the [[Province of Ontario]] and the [[Province of Quebec]] – the two most populous of the ten provinces – and midway between their respective provincial capitals, [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] and [[Quebec City|Quebec City, Quebec]].

* [[Wellington]] became the [[Capital of New Zealand|capital city of New Zealand]] in 1865. It lies at the southern tip of the [[North Island]] of New Zealand, the smaller of New Zealand's two main islands (which subsequently became the more populous island,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/population/page-5 "The South Island was the more densely populated from 1860 until 1900, largely because of the discovery of gold in the sixties, the relatively easy availability of land, and the South Island's freedom from Maori troubles.

Changes in a nation's political regime sometimes result in the designation of a new capital. Newly-independent [[Kazakhstan]] moved its capital to the existing city of [[Astana]] after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]].

A few nation states have multiple capitals, and there are also several states that have no capital. Some have a city as the capital but with most government agencies elsewhere.

=== Capitals that are not the seat of government ===
There are several countries where, for various reasons, the official capital and de facto [[seat of government]] are separated:
* {{flag|Benin}}: [[Porto-Novo]] is the official capital, but [[Cotonou]] is the seat of government.
* {{flag|Bolivia}}: [[Sucre, Bolivia|Sucre]] is the [[Constitution of Bolivia|constitution]]al capital, and the [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice (Bolivia)|supreme tribunal of justice]] is located in Sucre, making it the judicial capital. The ''[[Palacio Quemado|palacio quemado]]'', the [[Plurinational Legislative Assembly|national congress]] and [[Plurinational Electoral Organ|national electoral court]] are located in [[La Paz, Bolivia|La Paz]], making it the seat of government.
* {{flag|Ivory Coast}}: [[Yamoussoukro]] was designated the national capital in 1983, but most government offices and embassies are still located in [[Abidjan]].
* {{flag|Georgia}}: Since 2012, the seat of government has been [[Kutaisi]], but the [[President of Georgia|President]]'s residence and the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (country)|Supreme Court]] remain in [[Tbilisi]], the official capital.
* {{flag|Netherlands}}: [[Amsterdam]] is the constitutional national capital even though the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|Dutch government]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|parliament]], the [[Hoge Raad der Nederlanden|supreme court]], the [[Council of State of the Netherlands|Council of State]], and the [[Noordeinde Palace|work palace]] of the [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|King]] are all located in [[The Hague]], as are all the embassies. (''For more details see: [[Capital of the Netherlands]]''.)
* {{flag|Philippines}}: Presidential Decree No. 940, issued on June 24, 1976, designates the whole of [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] (NCR) as the seat of government, with the [[Manila|City of Manila]] as the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno940.html|title=Presidential Decree No. 940 : Philippine Laws, Statutes and Codes|publisher=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|date=1976-06-24|accessdate=2014-04-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906224944/http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno940.html|archivedate=6 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the region has many national government institutions aside from Malacanang Palace and some agencies or institutions that are located within the capital city.
Some historical examples of similar arrangements, where the recognized capital was not the official seat of government:
* {{flag|Kingdom of England}}: The traditional capital was the [[City of London]], while [[Westminster]], outside of the boundaries of the City of London, was the seat of government. They are both today part of the urban core of [[Greater London]].
* {{flag|Kingdom of France}}: The traditional capital was [[Paris]], though from 1682-1789 the seat of government was at the [[Palace of Versailles]], located in a rural area southwest of Paris.

Jerusalem serves as Israel's capital, with the presidential residence, government offices, supreme court and parliament ([[Knesset]]) located there, while the Palestinian Authority has no ''de facto'' or ''de jure'' control over any of Jerusalem.

== Capital as symbol ==
&lt;!-- "Forward capital" redirects here --&gt;
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
With the rise of modern [[empire]]s and the [[Nation state|nation-state]], the capital city has become a [[symbol]] for the [[sovereign state|state]] and its [[government]], and imbued with political meaning. Unlike [[medieval]] capitals, which were declared wherever a [[monarch]] held his or her court, the selection, relocation, founding, or capture of a modern capital city is an emotional event. For example:

* The ruined and almost uninhabited [[Athens]] was made capital of [[Independence of Greece|newly independent]] [[Greece]] in 1834, four years after the country gained its independence, with the [[Romanticism|romantic]] notion of reviving the glory of [[Ancient Greece]]. Similarly, following the [[Cold War]] and [[German reunification]], [[Berlin]] is now once again the capital of Germany. Other restored capital cities include [[Moscow]] after the [[October Revolution]].
* A symbolic relocation of a capital city to a geographically or demographically peripheral location may be for either [[economic geography|economic]] or [[military geography|strategic]] reasons (sometimes known as a '''forward capital''' or spearhead capital). [[Peter the Great]] moved his government from [[Moscow]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] to give the [[Russian Empire]] a [[Western world|western]] orientation. The economically significant city of [[Nafplion]] became the first capital of [[Greece]], when Athens was an unimportant village. The [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] emperors moved their capital to [[Peking]] from the more central [[Nanking]] to help supervise the border with the Mongols. During the 1857 rebellion, [[India|Indian rebels]] considered [[Delhi]] their capital, and [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]] was proclaimed emperor, but the ruling [[British India|British]] had their capital in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. In 1877, the British formally held a '[[Delhi Durbar|Durbar]]' in Delhi, proclaiming [[Queen Victoria]] as '[[Empress of India]]'. Delhi finally became the colonial capital after the [[Delhi Durbar|Coronation Durbar]] of King-Emperor [[George V]] in 1911, continuing as independent India's capital from 1947. Other examples include [[Abuja]], [[Astana]], [[Brasília]], [[Helsinki]], [[Islamabad]], [[Naypyidaw]] and [[Yamoussoukro]].
* The selection or founding of a "neutral" capital city, one unencumbered by regional or political identities, was meant to represent the unity of a new state when [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]]; [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]]; [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]; [[Madrid]]; [[Ottawa]]; [[Washington, D.C.]]; and [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] became capital cities. Sometimes, the location of a new capital city was chosen to terminate squabbling or possible squabbling between various entities, such as in the cases of Canberra, Ottawa, Washington, and Wellington.
* The British-built town of [[New Delhi]] represented a simultaneous break and continuity with the past, the location of Delhi being where many imperial capitals were built (Indraprastha, Dhillika, and Shahjahanabad) but the actual capital being the new British-built town designed by [[Edwin Lutyens]]. Wellington, on the southwestern tip of the [[North Island of New Zealand]], replaced the much more northerly city of [[Auckland]] to place the national capital close to the [[South Island]] and hence to placate its residents, many of whom had sympathies with separatism.
* During the [[American Civil War]], tremendous resources were expended to defend Washington, D.C., which bordered on the [[Confederate States of America]] (with the [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]]), from Confederate attack even though the relatively small federal government could easily have been moved elsewhere. Likewise, great resources were expended by the Confederacy in defending the Confederate capital from attack by the Union, in its exposed location of [[Richmond, Virginia]], barely {{convert|100|mi}} south of Washington, D.C..

== Capitals in military strategy ==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
[[File:Fall-of-constantinople-22.jpg|thumb|left|[[Constantinople]], the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], was the final part of the empire to fall to the [[Ottoman Turks]] due to its strong defences.]]
The capital city is usually but not always a primary target in a war, as capturing it usually guarantees capture of much of the enemy government, victory for the attacking forces, or at the very least demoralization for the defeated forces.

In ancient [[China]], where governments were massive centralized bureaucracies with little flexibility on the provincial level, a [[Chinese Dynasties|dynasty]] could easily be toppled with the fall of its capital. In the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, both [[Shu Han|Shu]] and [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] fell when their respective capitals of [[Chengdu]] and [[Jianye District|Jianye]] fell. The [[Ming dynasty]] relocated its capital from [[Nanjing]] to [[Beijing]], where they could more effectively control the generals and troops guarding the borders from [[Mongols]] and [[Manchus]]. The Ming was destroyed when the [[Li Zicheng]] took their seat of power, and this pattern repeats itself in Chinese history, until the fall of the traditional [[Confucian]] monarchy in the 20th century. After the [[Qing dynasty]]'s collapse, decentralization of authority and improved transportation and communication technologies allowed both the [[Chinese Nationalists]] and [[Chinese Communists]] to rapidly relocate capitals and keep their leadership structures intact during the great crisis of [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]].

National capitals were arguably less important as military objectives in other parts of the world, including the West, because of socioeconomic trends toward localized authority, a strategic modus operandi especially popular after the development of [[feudalism]] and reaffirmed by the development of democratic and capitalistic philosophies. In 1204, after the Latin [[Fourth Crusade|Crusaders]] captured the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] capital, [[Constantinople]], Byzantine forces were able to regroup in several provinces; provincial noblemen managed to reconquer the capital after 60 years and preserve the empire for another 200 years after that. The [[British Empire|British]] forces sacked various [[United States|American]] capitals repeatedly during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and [[War of 1812]], but American forces could still carry on fighting from the countryside, where they enjoyed support from local governments and the traditionally independent civilian frontiersmen. Exceptions to these generalizations include highly centralized states such as [[France]], whose centralized bureaucracies could effectively coordinate far-flung resources, giving the state a powerful advantage over less coherent rivals, but risking utter ruin if the capital were taken. In their military strategies, traditional enemies of France such as [[Prussia]] (in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1871) focused on the capture of [[Paris]].

{{refimprove|date=August 2014}}
The '''Central Belt''' of [[Scotland]] is the [[Demography of Scotland|area of highest population density within Scotland]]. It has a population of about 3.5 million covering an area of approximately 10,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, including [[Greater Glasgow]], [[Ayrshire]], [[Falkirk]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Lothian]] and [[Fife]].

Despite the name, it is not geographically central{{refn|The geographical [[centre of Scotland]] lies far to the north of the modern population heartlands. Various locations have been suggested including White Bridge on the B846 east of [[Schiehallion]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mapzone.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/mapzone/didyouknow/whereis/q_16_39.html "Where is the centre of mainland Scotland?"] [[Ordnance Survey]] Retrieved 11 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and a site near the village of [[Newtonmore]] in [[Badenoch]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.highlandhostel.co.uk/wherearewe.htm "The 'Where Are We' page"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201151537/http://www.highlandhostel.co.uk/wherearewe.htm |date=2005-12-01 }} highlandhostel.co.uk. Retrieved 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}}  but is nevertheless situated at the 'waist' of Scotland on a conventional map and the term 'central' is used in many [[Subdivisions of Scotland|local government, police and NGO designations]].

It was formerly known as the '''Midlands''' or '''Scottish Midlands''', but this term has fallen out of fashion{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

The Central Belt lies between the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] to the north and the [[Southern Uplands]] to the south.

==Smaller Central Belt==
[[File:Scotland blank map (small belt).png|thumb|200px|left|Image of the Central Belt area with urban areas (pink), including [[Glasgow]] to the west and [[Edinburgh]] to the east]]
The area is often considered{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} as the 'triangle' defined by the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8]], [[M80 motorway]] and [[M9 motorway (Scotland)|M9]] motorways stretching from [[Greenock]] and [[Glasgow]] in the west to [[Edinburgh]] in the east, encompassing towns such as [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], [[Cambuslang]], [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]], [[Stirling]], [[Falkirk]], [[Cumbernauld]], [[Livingston, Scotland|Livingston]] and [[Bathgate]]. It has been referred to as the '''Lowland Triangle'''.

==Larger Central Belt==
[[File:Scotland blank map (central belt).png|thumb|200px|left|Image of the larger Central Belt area with urban areas (pink), including [[Ayrshire]] in the south-west and [[Tayside]] to the north-east]]
The larger Central Belt is a trapezoid stretching from [[Dundee]], to [[Ayr]], and [[Dumbarton]] to [[Dunbar]]. This also takes in fairly densely populated areas such as [[Ayrshire]], [[Fife]], [[Midlothian]] and [[East Lothian]]. This area encompasses all the major cities of Scotland, except for [[Aberdeen]] and [[Inverness]] which are located in the north of the country.

Both of these areas also contain the bulk of Scotland's industrial works.

==Similar terms==
There are several terms in common usage in a Scottish context with a similar meaning to "Central Belt".

* The [[Central Lowlands]] is geologically defined and covers an area that stretches further to the north east than the Central Belt.
* The "Midland Valley" is a less commonly used expression synonymous with "Central Lowlands".
* The [[Scottish Lowlands]] are topographically and culturally defined and include all of Scotland outside of the [[Highlands and Islands]], including the [[Southern Uplands]].
* [[Central Scotland (disambiguation)|Central Scotland]] is a less well-defined term used to mean various things, including "Central Lowlands" and "Central Belt".

Pooley''' (born c.1951) is [[professor emeritus]] of [[Social geography|social]] and [[historical geography]] at the [[University of Lancaster]] where he worked from 1975 until c.2011. He is a specialist in transport and [[migration studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/groups/mobilities-lab/profiles/colin-pooley Professor Colin Pooley.] Mobilities.Lab, University of Lancaster. Retrieved 3 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Pooley has lived and worked in the North West of England since birth. He attended the University of Liverpool, graduating with an honours degree in geography in 1972 (Rural economy and agricultural change in the upper Itchen Valley, 1500-1800) and PhD in Geography in 1979 (Migration, mobility and residential areas in nineteenth-century Liverpool). He began teaching at [[Lancaster University]] in 1975, remaining until retirement and occupying several adminsitrative roles including head of the former Department of Geography. He was associated with the former Centre for North-West Regional Studies, and latterly Lancaster's Centre for Mobilities Research.

==Scholarship==
Pooley works on the social and historical geography of Britain and continental Europe since the eighteenth century. He began his career investigating housing, health, crime, ethnicity and social change, notably in Liverpool.

His more recent research has been on migration, mobility and sustainable urban travel, with one current (2018) project conducting comparative analyses of sustainable urban mobility in Europe, and culture and society from the 1890s to the present. His research techniques have included archival work, travel diaries, policy analysis and qualitative research techniques. 

He is the author of numerous volumes and articles on these topics.

A '''cuesta''' is a [[hill]] or [[ridge]] with a gentle slope on one side, and a steep slope on the other. In geology the term is more specifically applied to a ridge where a harder sedimentary rock overlies a softer layer, the whole being tilted somewhat from the horizontal. This results in a long and gentle backslope called a [[dip slope]] that conforms with the [[Strike and dip|dip]] of resistant [[Stratum|strata]], called [[caprock]]. Where erosion has exposed the frontslope of this, a steep slope or [[escarpment]] occurs. The resulting terrain may be called '''scarpland'''.

==Definition==
In general usage, a cuesta is a hill or ridge with a gentle slope (backslope) on one side, and a steep slope (frontslope) on the other. The word is from [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: "flank or slope of a hill; hill, mount, sloping ground". In geology and geomorphology, cuesta refers specifically to an asymmetric ridge with a long and gentle backslope called a dip slope that conforms with the dip of a resistant stratum or strata, called caprock. The outcrop of the caprock forms a steeper or even cliff-like frontslope (escarpment), cutting through the dipping strata that comprise the cuesta.&lt;ref name="Cotton1952a"&gt;Cotton, CA (1952) ''Geomorphology An Introduction to the Study of Landforms.'' John Wiley and Sons, New York. 505 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simonett1968a"&gt;Simonett, SD (1968) ''Cuesta.'' In RW Fairbridge, ed., pp. 233, ''The Encyclopedia of Geomorphology'' (Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences, Volume III), Reinhold, New York, 1296 pp. {{ISBN|978-0879331795}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson2005a"&gt;Jackson, JA, J Mehl and K Neuendorf (2005) ''Glossary of Geology.'' American Geological Institute, Alexandria, Virginia. 800 pp. {{ISBN|0-922152-76-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
Cuestas are the expression of extensive outcrops of gently dipping strata, typically [[sedimentary]] strata, that consist of alternating beds of weak or loosely cemented strata, i.e. [[shale]], [[mudstone]], and [[marl]] and hard, well-lithified strata, i.e. [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]]. The surfaces of the hard, erosion-resistant rock strata form the caprock of the backslope (dip-slope) of the cuesta, where erosion has preferentially removed the weaker strata. The frontslope of the cuesta consists of an escarpment that cuts across the [[Bed (geology)|bedding]] of the strata comprising it. Because of the gently dipping nature of the strata that forms a cuesta, a significant shift in horizontal location will take place as the landscape is lowered by [[erosion]].&lt;ref name="Cotton1952a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simonett1968a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thornbury1954a"&gt;Thornbury, W. D., 1954, "Principles of Geomorphology'' New York, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 618 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Twidale1993"&gt;[[Charles Rowland Twidale|Twidale, C.R.]] and E.M. Campbell (1993) ''Australian Landforms: Structure, Process and Time.'' Gleneagles Publishing, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. 568 pp. {{ISBN|9781875553020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the slope of a cuesta dips in the same direction as the sedimentary strata, the dip angle of this bedding (θ) can be calculated by (''v'' / ''h'') = tan(θ) where ''v'' is equal to the vertical distance and ''h'' is equal to the horizontal distance perpendicular to the strike of the beds.&lt;ref name="Easterbrook1999a"&gt;Easterbrook, DJ (1999) ''Surface Processes and Landforms'', 2nd ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuestas, [[homoclinal ridge]]s, and [[Hogback (geology)|hogbacks]] comprise a sequence of landforms that form a gradational continuum. These landforms differ only on the steepness of their backslopes and the relative differences in the inclination of their backslopes and frontslopes. These differences depend upon whether the dip of the strata from which they have been eroded are either nearly vertical, moderately dipping, or gently dipping. Because of their gradational nature, the exact angle of the backslope that separates these landforms is arbitrary and some differences in the specific angles used to define these landforms occur in the scientific literature. In addition, it also can be difficult to sharply distinguish immediately adjacent members of this series of landforms because of their gradational nature.&lt;ref name="Simonett1968a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thornbury1954a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Twidale1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fairbridge1968a"&gt;Fairbridge, RW (1968) ''Hogback and Flatiron.'' In RW Fairbridge, ed., pp. 524-525, ''The Encyclopedia of Geomorphology'' (Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences, Volume III), Reinhold, New York, 1296 pp. {{ISBN|978-0879331795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Two well-known cuestas in western [[New York (state)|New York]] and southern [[Ontario]] are the [[Onondaga Formation|Onondaga escarpment]] and the [[Niagara escarpment]], respectively.  The dip of the Onondaga is about 40 feet per mile (about 7.6&amp;nbsp;m/km) to the south. The escarpment edge faces north, and in its most populated section, runs roughly parallel to the southern [[Lake Ontario]] shoreline.

The [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in [[Texas]] is punctuated by a series of cuestas that parallel the coast, as are most coastal plains.&lt;ref name="Strahler1960a"&gt;Strahler, AN (1960) ''Physical Geography,'' 2nd ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, New York, New York&lt;/ref&gt; The Reynosa Plateau is the most coast-ward cuesta, which has surface expression with the Bordes-Oakville escarpment, on the northwest side and a low ridge on the eastern boundary, called the Reynosa Cuesta, where the deposits dip below later [[Pliocene]]-[[Pleistocene]] deposits of the Willis and Lissie Formations.

Cuestas have less dramatic expression in the United Kingdom, with two notable examples being the northwest-facing escarpment of the [[Jurassic]] [[chalk]] [[White Horse Hills]] and the similarly aligned escarpment of the [[Cotswolds]], sometimes called the Cotswold Edge.

In continental Europe, the [[Swabian Alb]] offers particularly good views of cuestas in [[Jurassic]] rock. In [[France]], the term for a cuesta is the same as for a coastline: "côte". Notable French cuestas are the wine-growing regions of [[Côte d'Or (escarpment)|Côte d'Or]] and [[Côtes du Rhône]].

The Machinchang Formation outcrops in the [[Langkawi]] islands off the coast of northwestern [[Malaysia]]. The formation is one of the oldest exposed rock units in Southeast Asia and has an extensive eroded [[anticline]] cuesta topography — dating back to Cambrian.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

'''Daniel Wynne Gade''' (September 28, 1936 &amp;ndash; June 15, 2015) was a professor of [[Geography]] at the [[University of Vermont]] and a prominent member of the [[Berkeley School of Latin Americanist Geography]]. His main interests were in the fields of [[cultural geography]] and [[historical geography]], as well as [[ethnobotany]], [[cultural ecology]], and [[mountain research]]. His regional focus was on the Central [[Andes]] of [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], and [[Bolivia]]; moreover, Gade also investigated [[cultural landscape]]s of francophone [[Canada]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], highland [[Madagascar]], southern [[France]] and northern [[Italy]].   He was born in [[Niagara Falls, New York]].

He received the bachelor's degree from [[Valparaiso University]] (Indiana) in 1959, a Master of Arts from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana&amp;ndash;Champaign]] in 1960, and a Master of Science, followed by a Doctorate, from the [[University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madison]] in 1967. His dissertation on human plant use in the Vilcanota Valley of Peru was published in the series ''Biogeographica'', then edited by German geographer [[Josef Schmithüsen]]. During his travels in South America, he also met the Nazi scientist [[Heinz Brücher]] and analyzed his work in a publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gade|first=Daniel W.|date=2006|title=Converging ethnobiology and ethnobiography: cultivated plants, Heinz Brucher and Nazi ideology|url=http://www.brockwell-bake.org.uk/docs/Brucher%20JEB%202005.pdf|journal=Journal of Ethnobiology|language=en-US|volume=26|issue=1|pages=82–106|doi=10.2993/0278-0771(2006)26[82:ceaecp]2.0.co;2|issn=0278-0771|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Burlington, Vermont]] on June 15, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Annals of the American Association of Geographers (2015): [http://news.aag.org/2015/06/in-memoriam-daniel-w-gade/ In Memoriam: Daniel W.

The '''Diego de Ocampo''' is the highest point in the [[Cordillera Septentrional]] in the [[Santiago Province (Dominican Republic)|Santiago Province]], [[Dominican Republic]].

== Etymology ==
This peak was named for Diego de Ocampo, a son of a wealthy Spaniard whose mother was of taino race from the island of Hispanola. He was named a true heir to his father in the Spanish courts. Diego de Ocampo rebelled, pillaged and sabotaged plantations in [[Concepción de la Vega]], [[San Juan de la Maguana]], [[Azua de Compostela]] and [[Baoruco Province|Bahoruco]]. He made a truce with the [[Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo|Spanish authorities]], but rebelled again soon after. Later on he was captured and executed by Spanish troops, according to Governor Cerrato and the [[Oidor]] Grajeada in 1546.

'''Doi Nang Non''' ({{lang-th|ดอยนางนอน}}, {{IPA-th|dɔ̄ːj nāːŋ nɔ̄ːn|pron}}; 'Mountain of the Sleeping Lady') is a mountain range in the [[Thai highlands]] in [[Chiang Rai Province]], [[Thailand]]. It is a [[Karst|karstic]] formation with numerous waterfalls and caves rising at the southern end of the [[Daen Lao Range]]. Part of its area is managed as the '''Tham Luang–Khun Nam Nang Non Forest Park''' ({{lang-th|วนอุทยานถ้ำหลวง-ขุนน้ำนางนอน}}).

==Geography==
Doi Nang Non consists of a long hill tract that lies on the west side of the highway between [[Chiang Rai]] and [[Mae Sai Sub-district|Mae Sai]]. The greater part of the range is in [[Mae Sai District]], extending west and southwest of [[Pong Pha]] along the border with [[Myanmar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edtguide.com/DoiNangNon_65123 Doi Nang Non (ดอยนางนอน) - Location] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710171510/http://www.edtguide.com/DoiNangNon_65123 |date=2011-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mountain range is an unusual land feature when seen from certain angles as its silhouette takes the shape of a reclining woman with long hair. Its highest point is [[Doi Tung]], which corresponds to the belly of the lady.&lt;ref name="GE"/&gt;

===Caves===
There are a number of caves and underground water courses in the range area.

*'''Khun Nam Nang Non''' ({{lang-th|ขุนน้ำนางนอน}}; 'Headwaters of the Sleeping Lady') is a natural pond into which water flows from the rocks above. This water is said to be the tears of the legendary lady's ghost.

==History==
In 1986 an eight km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sector of the range which included the entrance to the main cave was declared the Tham Luang–Khun Nam Nang Non Forest Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://park.dnp.go.th/visitor/nationparkshow.php?PTA_CODE=4022 ถ้ำหลวง-ขุนน้ำนางนอน (วน.)

===2018 rescue operation===
{{main| Tham Luang cave rescue}}
On 23 June 2018, a group of twelve boys aged between 11 and 17, who went to explore Tham Luang Nang Non with their assistant football coach, aged 25, went missing. The group was found 10 days later. They were part of a local junior football team. The cave they entered became flooded. Thai Navy SEAL divers had been searching the caves ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/power-line-put-in-thai-cave-to-help-search-for-missing-boys/2018/06/25/8cb52abc-78d8-11e8-ac4e-421ef7165923_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.3d5e23c090d4 "Flooding complicates cave search for Thai soccer team" ''Washington Post'', 26 June 2018] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705032640/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/power-line-put-in-thai-cave-to-help-search-for-missing-boys/2018/06/25/8cb52abc-78d8-11e8-ac4e-421ef7165923_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.3d5e23c090d4 |date=2018-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to heavy rain which further flooded the cave entrance, searches were periodically interrupted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://weather.com/news/trending/video/search-suspended-for-boys-in-flooded-cave-in-thailand "Search Suspended for Boys in Flooded Cave in Thailand" ''The Weather Channel'', 26 June 2018] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629160947/https://weather.com/news/trending/video/search-suspended-for-boys-in-flooded-cave-in-thailand |date=29 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Thai Navy|Thai NAVY]] divers soon got help from American, Australian, British, and Chinese divers, military members, and emergency personnel. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/world/australian-divers-ng-b88891340z|title=No rest for Aussie rescue divers|date=2018-07-09|work=PerthNow|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/thai-navy-seal-team-posts-touching-photo-during-international-effort-to-rescue-boys-from-cave/|title=Thai Navy SEAL team posts touching photo during international effort to rescue boys from cave|work=CBS News|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
One of the legends goes that in ancient times a beautiful princess fell in love with a stable boy and became pregnant. Knowing their love was forbidden, they fled and went in the cave to rest. When the boy went in search of food, he was caught by the princess' father's army and killed. The distraught princess stabbed herself to death and the legend says her blood became the water that flows through the cave, while her body is the surrounding mountains, said to look like a sleeping woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/spirit-of-mythical-princess-looms-over-thai-cave-crisis/2018/06/27/7feaa5a4-79f6-11e8-ac4e-421ef7165923_story.html|title=Spirit of mythical princess looms over Thai cave crisis|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
Some of the caves in the hill area have been developed as a tourist attraction. There is a viewpoint at [[Mae Chan District]], from where the "sleeping lady" can best be observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotelsguidethailand.com/travel/travel_detail.php?l=en&amp;code=1253 Doi Nang Non View Point] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712222020/http://www.hotelsguidethailand.com/travel/travel_detail.php?l=en&amp;code=1253 |date=2011-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Local tour guides joke that Doi Nang Non would be "the highest mountain in the world", if only the supposed lady would get up and stand on her feet.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8437">'''Edward "Ed" Harwood''' (born February 4, 1950) is an American inventor, entrepreneur, and one of the pioneers of [[aeroponics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Say Hello To The (Soon To Be) World's Largest Indoor Vertical Farm|url=http://modernfarmer.com/2015/03/say-hello-to-the-soon-to-be-worlds-largest-indoor-vertical-farm/|website=modern farmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founder of Aero Farm Systems, L.L.C. (AeroFarms), as well as the chief inventor of “Method and apparatus for aeroponic farming" (United States Patent No. 8,782,948). [[File:Ed_Harwood_Sailing.jpg|thumb|Ed Harwood]]

==Early life and education==
Ed Harwood was born in Stoughton, Massachusetts. He attended [[Colorado State University]], where he received three separate degrees: a BS in microbiology, a BS in animal science, and an MS in animal science. Harwood then went on to receive his PhD in dairy science and artificial intelligence from the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Harwood|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edward_Harwood/info|website=Research Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Subsequent to working in dairy science in [[Madison, WI]], most notably as [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) of Topline Waikato, Inc., a New Zealand milking equipment supplier, Harwood moved to Ithaca, NY to work at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ed Harwood|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/person/ed-harwood#/entity|website=CrunchBase}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, after serving as the Associate Director of Cornell Cooperative Extension, he built a prototype aeroponic system designed to grow vegetables indoors in a sustainable way, without pesticides. The advantages of the system, in comparison to traditional agriculture, include: less water usage, better air flow, and the ability to grow vegetables year round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeroponics: a piece of the urban farming jigsaw puzzle?|url=http://smallfarms.cornell.edu/2010/10/03/aeroponics-a-piece-of-the-urban-farming-jigsaw-puzzle/|website=Cornell Small Farms Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; After experimenting to find the most suitable textiles for the system, a critical piece of the technology’s success, he settled on a durable microfleece cloth that could be reused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AeroFarms Plans to Grow 1.5 Million Pounds of Leafy Greens in the Middle of Newark|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-30/aerofarms-plans-aeroponic-farm-in-newark-to-grow-leafy-greens|website=BloombergBusiness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Harwood took his technology and launched the [[Ithaca, NY]] based farming venture GreatVeggies. He began selling lettuce to local grocers and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vertical Farming in Masdar City? AeroFarms' Soil-less Solution|url=http://www.greenprophet.com/2010/05/aerofarms-vertical-farming/|website=Green Prophet}}&lt;/ref&gt; After significant struggle finding investors interested in aeroponics, he received funding from the Quercus Trust and 21Ventures in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Startup Profile: AeroFarms: Urban Agriculture Aeroponic Systems|url=http://seedstock.com/2011/03/29/startup-profile-aerofarms-systems-urban-agriculture-aeroponics/|website=Seedstock}}&lt;/ref&gt; He renamed the company AeroFarms and transitioned his focus from selling lettuce to selling the patented systems to farmers and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainability Leadership Series to host discussion|url=http://theithacan.org/news/college-briefing-feb-5/|website=The Ithacan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeroponics Shapes Future of Urban Ag|url=http://www.urbanfarmonline.com/urban-farm-news/2010/11/05/aeroponics-shapes-urban-ag-future.aspx|website=Urban Farm Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aerofarms Raises 500,000 in Seed Funding|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100208006298/en/AeroFarms-Raises-500000-Seed-Funding|website=Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harwood's first notable success as CEO of AeroFarms came in 2010 when he and EcoVeggies partnered with Phillip's Academy Charter School in [[Newark, NJ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Crop Sprouts Without Soil or Sunshine|url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/a-crop-sprouts-without-soil-or-sunshine/|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Harwood’s patented aeroponic systems was placed in a science classroom as part of the school's EcoSPACES program, with the goal of helping students learn about sustainable growing techniques. The aeroponic system is currently located in the cafeteria, steps from the salad bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Jersey's 'Brick City' just broke ground on the world's largest vertical farm|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/aerofarms-newark-vertical-farming-opening-2015-7|website=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leafy-green vegetables grown by the students are used in the school kitchen to prepare nutritious and healthy meals for the kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For these students, lunch is personal|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/vertical-farming-for-these-students-lunch-is-personal/|website=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, as part of her [[Let's Move]] initiative, Michelle Obama visited Phillip's Academy and was shown the aeroponic system by the students before eating a meal next to it in the cafeteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michelle Obama Visits Newark School On National Garden Tour|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/04/07/michelle-obama-newark-garden/|website=CBS New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving awards in 2010 and 2011, including the Red Herring Global Top 100 North America award and World Technology Award for the Environment, Harwood and AeroFarms accepted investment from other partners, including Goldman Sachs, Prudential and the city of Newark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Newark, a Vertical Indoor Farm Helps Anchor and Area's Revival|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/realestate/commercial/in-newark-a-vertical-indoor-farm-helps-anchor-an-areas-revival.html|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Technology Summit &amp; Awards 2011|url=http://wtn.net/summit2011/finalists.html|website=WTN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Red Herring North America Top 100|url=http://www.redherring.com/events/rhna/2010-red-herring-top-100-north-america/|website=Red Herring}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2014, AeroFarms broke ground on the world's largest indoor vertical farm, a 70,000-square-foot, $39 million facility located in a former steel mill in Newark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Pie In The Sky?

[[Ian Frazier]], in [[The New Yorker]], likened Harwood's invention to the Wright brothers' first bi-plane, stating: "For concentrated ingenuity and handcrafted uniqueness, its closest simile, I think, is the Wright brothers’ first biplane, the Flyer, now on display in the National Air and Space Museum, in Washington. Like the Flyer, and like many other great inventions, Harwood’s prototype is also an objet d’art." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Vertical Farm|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/09/the-vertical-farm|website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 25, 2018, Harwood was awarded the United FreshTEC Achievement Award for outstanding technical achievements by the United Fresh Produce Association for advancing “the fresh produce industry through innovation in indoor growing technologies.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Fresh To Recognize Industry Leaders With 2018 United FreshTEC and United FreshMKT Achievement Awards|url=http://www.unitedfreshshow.org/news/united-fresh-to-recognize-industry-leaders-with-2018-united-freshtec-and-united-freshmkt-achievement-awards|website=United Fresh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fire history''', the ecological science of the study of the history of wildfires, is a subdiscipline of [[fire ecology]]. Patterns of forest fires in historical and prehistorical time provide information relevant to the pattern of vegetation in modern landscapes. It provides an estimate of the historical range of variability of a natural disturbance regime, and can be used to identify the processes affecting the occurrence of fire. Fire history reconstructions are achieved by compiling atlases of past fires, using the [[tree ring]] record from fire scars and tree ages, and the charcoal record from soils and sediments.

== Prehistoric fires ==
Sustained wildfire can only exist once oxygen levels and fuel sources were present in sufficient quantities. Between 400 and 450 million year ago, fire became a feature of the landscape.&lt;ref name="Pyne2001"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/757509384|title=Fire : a brief history|last=1949-|first=Pyne, Stephen J.,|date=2001|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=029598144X|location=Seattle|oclc=757509384}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11–14}} The presence of [[fusain]] (fossil charcoal), beginning in the early [[Carboniferous]] attests to this fire history and forms an important element of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]].&lt;ref name="Pyne2001" /&gt;{{rp|11–14}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2000-12-01|title=The Pre-Quaternary history of fire|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018200001929|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|volume=164|issue=1-4|pages=281–329|doi=10.1016/S0031-0182(00)00192-9|issn=0031-0182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth record of a tree in seasonal climates is preserved in the growth rings in the stem wood; the field of [[dendrochronology]] is the study of the record of climate and other events preserved in the growth record. Each growth ring represents one year of life. The thickness of each ring indicates the amount of wood produced during that growing season. At the beginning of the growing season large cells are able to quickly divide creating a light colored wood. When growth slows down, generally in colder months, a darker wood is created from smaller cells dividing more slowly. Thus, one year is represented by a light inner ring and a darker outer ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theforestacademy.com/tree-knowledge/annual-growth-rings/#.Whs6c0qnFhF|title=Annual growth rings {{!}} Tree knowledge {{!}} Booklet {{!}} Forest Academy - Domtar|website=www.theforestacademy.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rings can be counted from dead trees as well as stumps left behind from logging. A sample can be collected from a living tree using tools like the [[increment borer]]. The increment borer is a hollow steel tube used to extract a core sample from a tree’s trunk. The growth rings in a core sample are counted to determine the age of that tree. Ages of stand-replacing fires may be determined by determining the cohort-age of trees that established after a fire. For example, tree-ring dating of large stands will show the age of the forest, and may provide an estimate of when the last large disturbance event occurred.

Sometimes growth rings exhibit scars. A fire scar forms when heat kills the vascular cambium beneath the bark, which then heals over subsequent years as growth rings curl over the scarred area, thus protecting the tree from infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/rmrs/science-spotlights/making-scar-how-fire-scars-develop-trees|title=The making of a scar:  How fire scars develop in trees  {{!}} Rocky Mountain Research Station|website=www.fs.fed.us|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method can be used to date the year a fire occurred. Observing the scars establishes the timeline of a forest fire and the time between fires at a site. Surveying many trees over a large sample area provides a view to individual fire events and the overall fire regime. Not all tree species scar and show evidence of fire. Most pine species in the subgenus [[List of Pinus species#Subgenus Pinus|Pinus]] readily produce scars that are protected by resin; such scarring on other trees may result in death, leaving no fire record behind.

===Research and data examples===
Prior to Euro-American settlement in western North America, fire histories from scars preserved in ponderosa pine forests often reveal a pattern of frequent fire (often with 5 to 20 year intervals in a single area), with a pattern in time and space strongly related to past variations in climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falk|first=Donald A|last2=Heyerdahl|first2=Emily K|last3=Brown|first3=Peter M|last4=Farris|first4=Calvin|last5=Fulé|first5=Peter Z|last6=McKenzie|first6=Donald|last7=Swetnam|first7=Thomas W|last8=Taylor|first8=Alan H|last9=Van Horne|first9=Megan L|date=2011-10-01|title=Multi-scale controls of historical forest-fire regimes: new insights from fire-scar networks|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/100052/abstract|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|language=en|volume=9|issue=8|pages=446–454|doi=10.1890/100052|issn=1540-9309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel reduction from grazing and fire suppression greatly reduced the amount of fire in dry forests over the last 100 years.

A study by Arne Buechiling and William L. Baker in 2004 identified 41 fire events beginning in 1533 in a 9200-ha study area north of Estes Park, Colorado. They sampled 3461 tree cores and 212 fire scars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buechling|first=Arne|last2=Baker|first2=William L.|date=2004|title=A fire history from tree rings in a high-elevation forest of Rocky Mountain National Park|url=http://cjfr.nrc.ca/|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=34|pages=1259–1273|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire scar data provided greater insight into the fire event parameters. Of the 41 fires, 22 where high-severity crown fires, 7 low-severity surface fires, and 8 mixed-severity fires. Fires larger than 300 ha were few, but composed a substantial proportion of the area burned since 1700. Drought periods led to larger fires.

There is little known about the fire history in some places. Central Europe for instance has a lack of intact forests with old growth trees or an abundance of dead or cut down trees that can be used to reconstruct the past fire regimes. An exception to this lacking history is the [[Białowieża Forest|Bialowieza Primeval Forest]] in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niklasson|first=Mats|last2=Zin|first2=Ewa|last3=Zielonka|first3=Tomasz|last4=Feijen|first4=Markus|last5=Korczyk|first5=Adolf F.|last6=Churski|first6=Marcin|last7=Samojlik|first7=Tomasz|last8=Jedrzejewska|first8=Bogumiła|last9=Gutowski|first9=Jerzy M.|date=2010|title=A 350-year tree-ring fire record from Białowie_za Primeval Forest, Poland: implications for Central European lowland fire history|url=|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=98|pages=1319–1329|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of researchers were able to use a 350-year tree-ring fire record to reconstruct the fire history in precise detail. This is a shining example of how the method can be used in a place with lost or no written history of a fire regime.

'''Fordsburg Square''' in [[Fordsburg]] is a thriving square that is the site of a [[flea market]] was recently known for being run-down. This square in [[Johannesburg]] is the location of a battle between striking miners and the South African police, army and air force.

==Description==
Fordsburg Square is the site of a [[flea market]] that was known for being run-down. 

==History==

{{main|Rand Rebellion}}
The [[Rand Rebellion]] against the powers of law and order ended here on the 14 March 1922.&lt;ref name=blueplaque/&gt; The uprising came out of a strike of black gold miners that started on `1 January 1922 in response to five shilling wage cut per shift. The White workers joined them ten days later because the owners of the mine had decided to cut costs by employing (cheaper) more black miners instead of the existing white workers.&lt;ref name=miners&gt;{{cite web|last=Human &amp; Rousseau|title=Coal Miners Strike on the Rand|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/coal-miners-strike-rand|publisher=South Africa History Online|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The workers did not just withdraw their labour but the a portion of the 20,000 white workers and the 180,000 black miners took over areas of Johannesburg and they were in control of [[Benoni, Gauteng|Benoni]], [[Brakpan]] suburbs of [[Fordsburg]] and [[Jeppestown|Jeppe]]. The strike had become an open rebellion and on the 15 March the army was called to bombard the Fordsburg square which was deemed the stronghold of the rebels.&lt;ref name=squarefalls&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rand Revolt strikers' stronghold at Fordsburg Square falls to the government|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/rand-revolt-strikers039-stronghold-fordsburg-square-falls-government|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time the rebels had dug substantial [[World War One]] trenches across the square. Even the [[South African Air Force]] was called to bomb this square but they hit the nearby Mint Road [[Presbyterian Church]].&lt;ref name=blueplaque&gt;{{cite web|title=Home » Battle of Fordsburg Square - 14 March 1922 Battle of Fordsburg Square - 14 March 1922|url=http://www.blueplaques.co.za/content/battle-fordsburg-square-14-march-1922|publisher=blueplaques.co.za|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
One of the buildings that offered protection to the rebels was the municipal toilets and these are still standing and in use. In 2013 a Blue Plaque was added to the size of that building to commemorate the role that the square took in the [[History of South Africa]].&lt;ref name=blueplaque/&gt;

The '''foreign relations of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria''' refers to the external relations of the self-proclaimed autonomous region of the [[Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]] (DFNS). The region, consisting of three regions ([[Afrin Region|Afrin]], [[Euphrates Region|Euphrates]] and [[Jazira Region|Jazira]]) was formed in early 2014 in the context of the [[Syrian Civil War]], a conflict that has caused the involvement of many different countries and international organizations in the area.

The [[Constitution of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria]], which defines the DFNS as an integral part of [[Syria]] and not a separate country, states that "the Autonomous Regions shall not interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries, and it shall safeguard its relations with neighboring states, resolving any conflicts peacefully." It also mandates, among other executive council bodies, a Body of Foreign Relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|Constitution of the Rojava Cantons|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are numerous purpose-built initiatives of international support for Rojava and people in Rojava as well as a considerable amount of freelance volunteers. The international volunteers with the [[People's Protection Units|People's Protection Units (YPG)]] self-defence militia have been widely reported on,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/lions-rojava-282706690/|title=US and British volunteers describe fighting with Kurds in Syria|publisher=[[Middle East Eye]] |date=2015-07-29|accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2016/06/syrian-kurds-erect-monument-memory-foreign-fighters-fallen-war-isis/|title=Syrian Kurds erect monument in memory of foreign fighters fallen in war against ISIS|publisher=[[ARA News]] |date=2016-06-17|accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2016/04/foreign-fighters-set-medical-unit-help-syrian-kurds/|title=Western volunteers set up Medical Unit in the DFNS to help Syrian Kurds in war on ISIS|publisher=[[ARA News]] |date=2016-04-30|accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as to a lesser extent have the international volunteers with the DFNS Plan infrastructure-building initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian Kurdish region witnessing campaign of ‘Organic Agriculture in Rojava’|url=http://aranews.net/2016/05/syrian-kurdish-region-witnessing-campaign-organic-agriculture-rojava/|accessdate=2016-05-16|publisher=[[ARA News]] |date=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017, Turkish deterrence against international civil society engagement in the DFNS has been breaking down.

A number of international NGOs help to support huge number of refugees who have fled to Rojava from other parts of Syria or from Iraq, while trying to keep a low profile for the aforementioned reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian Kurds provide safe haven for thousands of Iraqis fleeing ISIS|url=http://aranews.net/2016/07/syrian-kurds-provide-safe-haven-thousands-iraqis-fleeing-isis/|accessdate=2016-07-02|publisher=[[ARA News]] |date=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, the municipality of [[Rome]], capital of [[Italy]], recognised the municipality of [[Kobani]] as a [[sister city]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kurdishquestion.com/oldsite/index.php/kurdistan/west-kurdistan/rome-declares-kobane-sister-city.html|title=Rome Declares Kobane 'Sister City'|publisher=Kurdishquestion|date=2015-04-05|accessdate=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, the [[Kurdish Red Crescent]] opened a hospital in Kobanî, their first hospital in the [[Euphrates Region]]. Many international organizations had given a helping hand as well as sending them special medical equipment, [[UNICEF]] and [[Doctors Without Borders]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.hawarnews.com/krc-opens-the-first-hospital-in-kobani/|title=KRC opens the first hospital in Kobani|publisher=[[Hawar News Agency]]|date=2016-09-24|accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of Hadramout.svg|thumb|Flag of the Hadhrami people]]
'''Hadramaut''', '''Hadhramaut''', '''Hadramout''', '''Hadramawt''' or '''Ḥaḍramūt''' ({{lang-ar|حضرموت}} ''Ḥaḍramawt''; [[Ancient South Arabian script|Musnad]]: 𐩢𐩳𐩧𐩣𐩩) is a region on the [[South Arabia|southern end]] of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The name is officially retained in [[Hadhramaut Governorate]] of the [[Yemen|Republic of Yemen]]. The people of Hadhramaut are called ''[[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]]'' and speak [[Hadhrami Arabic]].

==Etymology==
The origin of the name "Ḥaḍramawt" is not exactly known, and there are numerous competing hypotheses about its meaning.

The most common [[folk etymology]] is that the region's name means "death has come," from {{lang|ar|حضر}} /ḥaḍara/ (Arabic for "he came") and  {{lang|ar|موت}} /mawt/ ("death"), though there are multiple explanations for how it came to be known as such. One explanation is that this is a nickname of [[Amar bin Qahtan|'Amar ibn Qaḥṭān]], a legendary invader of the region, whose battles always left many dead.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Another theory is that after the destruction of [[Thamud|Thamūd]], the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Saleh|Ṣāliḥ]] relocated himself and about 4,000 of his followers to the region and it was there that he died, thus lending the region its morbid name "death has come." A third related etymology posits that {{lang|ar|حضر}} refers to the inhabitants of the area, themselves, and hints that the way of life of the ancient ''[[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]]'' people was severe and ascetic in the eyes of the bordering kingdoms situated in today's North Yemen.

Ḥaḍramawt is also identified with [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Hazarmaveth|Hazarmawet]] ({{lang-hbo|חֲצַרְמָוֶת|italic=no|rtl=yes}}; [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 10:26&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|10:26|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 1:20&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|1:20|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;). There, it is the name of a son of [[Joktan]] (who is also identified with [[Qahtanite|Qahtan]]), the ancestor of the South Arabian kingdoms. According to various Bible dictionaries, the name "Hazarmaveth" means "court of death," reflecting a meaning similar to the Arabic folk etymologies.

Scholarly theories of the name's origin are somewhat more varied, but none have gained general acceptance. [[Juris Zarins]], rediscoverer of the city claimed to be the ancient [[Incense Route]] trade capital [[Iram of the Pillars|Ubar]] in Oman, suggested that the name may come from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ὕδρευματα}} {{transl|grc|hydreumata}}, or enclosed (and often fortified) watering stations at [[wadi]]s. In a ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' interview,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lost City of Arabia |format=NOVA online interview with Dr. Juris Zarins |publisher=[[PBS]] |date=September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; he described Ubar as

{{Quote|a kind of fortress/administration center set up to protect the water supply from raiding [[Bedouin]] tribes. Surrounding the site, as far as six miles away, were smaller villages, which served as small-scale encampments for the caravans. An interesting parallel to this are the fortified water holes in the [[Eastern Desert]] of [[Egypt]] from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times. There, they were called ''hydreumata''.}}

Though it accurately describes the configuration of settlements in the Pre-Islamic Wadi Ḥaḍramawt, this explanation for the name is anachronistic and has gained no wider scholarly acceptance.

Already in the Pre-Islamic period, variations of the name are attested as early as the middle of the First Millennium BC. The names ''ḥḍrmt'' (𐩢𐩳𐩧𐩣𐩩) and ''ḥḍrmwt'' (𐩢𐩳𐩧𐩣𐩥𐩩) are found in texts of the [[Old South Arabian|Old South Arabian languages]] ([[Hadramautic language|Ḥaḍramitic]], [[Minaean language|Minaic]], [[Qatabanian language|Qatabanic]], and [[Sabaean language|Sabaic]]), though the second form is not found in any known Ḥaḍramitic inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dasi.humnet.unipi.it/index.php?id=32&amp;prjId=1&amp;corId=0&amp;colId=0&amp;navId=22579382&amp;wl_group=11&amp;wl_subgroup=5|website=DASI: Digital Archive for the Study of pre-islamic arabian Inscriptions|title= General word list |accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In either form, the word itself can be a toponym, a tribal name, or the name of the kingdom of Ḥaḍramawt. In the late Fourth or early Third Century BC, [[Theophrastus]] gives the name Άδρραμύτα,&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus: ''Historia Plantarum''. 9,4.&lt;/ref&gt; a direct transcription of the Semitic name into Greek.

As Southern Arabia is the homeland of the [[South Semitic languages|South Semitic]] language subfamily, a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] origin for the name is highly likely. [[Kamal Salibi]] proposed an alternative etymology for the name which argues that the diphthong "aw" in the name is an incorrect vocalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salibi|first1=Kamal|editor1-last=al-Qāḍī|title=Ḥaḍramūt: A Name with a Story|journal=Studia Arabica et Islamica: Festschrift for Iḥsān ʿAbbās on His Sixtieth Birthday|date=1981|pages=393–397}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that "-ūt" is a frequent ending for place names in the Ḥaḍramawt, and given that "Ḥaḍramūt" is the colloquial pronunciation of the name, and apparently also its ancient pronunciation, the correct reading of the name should be "place of ḥḍrm." He proposes, then, that the name means "the green place," which is apt for its well-watered wadis whose lushness contrasts with the surrounding high desert plateau.

==Geography==

Narrowly, Hadhramaut refers to the historical [[Qu'aiti]] and [[Kathiri]] [[sultan]]ates {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}, which were in the [[Aden Protectorate]] overseen by the [[Resident (title)|British Resident]] at [[Aden]] until their abolition upon the independence of [[South Yemen]] in 1967. The current governorate of Hadhramaut roughly incorporates the former territory of the two sultanates{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} It consists of a narrow, arid [[coastal plain]] bounded by the steep [[escarpment]] of a broad [[plateau]] (''al-Jawl'', averaging {{convert|1370|m|abbr=on}}), with a very sparse network of deeply sunk wadis (seasonal watercourses). The undefined northern edge of Hadhramaut slopes down to the desert [[Rub' al Khali|Empty Quarter]].

In a wider sense, Hadhramaut includes the territory of [[Al Mahrah Governorate|Mahra]] to the east all the way to the contemporary border with Oman.&lt;ref name="SchofieldBlake220"&gt;Richard N. Schofield, Gerald Henry Blake, ''Arabian Boundaries: Primary Documents, 1853–1957 Volume 22'', Archive Editions, 1988, {{ISBN|1-85207-130-3}}, pg 220 ...should be made along the coast to the west as far as the DHOFAR-HADHRAMAUT frontier...&lt;/ref&gt; This encompasses the current governorates of Hadramaut and Mahra in their entirety as well as parts of the [[Shabwah Governorate]].

The Hadhramis live in densely built towns centered on traditional watering stations along the wadis. Hadhramis harvest crops of [[wheat]] and [[millet]], tend [[Phoenix dactylifera|date palm]] and [[coconut]] groves, and grow some [[coffee]]. On the plateau, Bedouins tend sheep and goats. Society is still highly tribal, with the old [[Sayyid|Seyyid]] [[aristocracy]], descended from the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}, traditionally educated and strict in their Islamic observance and highly respected in religious and secular affairs. {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Modern history of Hadhramaut==
The [[Qu'aiti]] sultans ruled the vast majority of Hadramaut{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}, under a loose [[British Empire|British]] [[protectorate]], the Aden Protectorate, from 1882 to 1967{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}, when the Hadhramaut was annexed by South Yemen.

The Qu'aiti dynasty was founded by [['Umar bin Awadh al-Qu’aiti]], a [[Yafa’i]] tribesman whose wealth and influence as hereditary [[Jemadar]] of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]'s armed forces enabled him to establish the Qu'aiti dynasty in the latter half of the 19th century, winning British recognition of his paramount status in the region, in 1882. The British Government and the traditional and scholarly sultan Ali bin Salah signed a treaty in 1937 appointing the British government as "advisors" in Hadhramaut. The British exiled him to Aden in 1945, but the Protectorate lasted until 1967.

In 1967, the former British [[Colony of Aden]] and the former Aden Protectorate including Hadramaut became an independent [[Communism|Communist]] state, the [[People's Republic of South Yemen]], later the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. South Yemen was united with [[North Yemen]] in 1990 as the Republic of Yemen. See [[History of Yemen]] for recent history.

The capital and largest city of Hadhramaut is the port [[Mukalla]]. Mukalla had a 1994 population of 122,400 and a 2003 population of 174,700, while the port city of [[Ash Shihr]] has grown from 48,600 to 69,400 in the same time. One of the more historically important cities in the region is [[Tarim, Yemen|Tarim]]. An important locus of Islamic learning, it is estimated to contain the highest concentration of descendants of the Prophet Muhammad anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name="No Room at the Inn"&gt;Alexandroni, S. [http://www.newstatesman.com/200710180041 No Room at the Inn]. ''New Statesman'', October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==

Historically, Hadhramaut was known for being a major producer of [[frankincense]], which was mainly exported to [[Mumbai]] in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Prothero84&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Arabia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|page=84|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11767/view/1/84/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region has also produced [[senna (plant)|senna]] and [[coconut]]. Currently, Hadhramout produces approximately 260,000 barrels of oil per day; one of the most productive fields is Al Maseelah in the  strip (14), which was discovered in 1993. The Yemeni government is keen to develop its oil fields to increase oil production in order to increase national wealth in response to the requirements of economic and social development in the country. Oil contributes 30-40% of the nation's GDP, over 70% of total state revenues, and more than 90% of the value of the country's exports.&lt;ref name=Prothero85&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Arabia|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

'''Hemispherical photography''', also known as [[fisheye lens|fisheye]] or [[forest canopy|canopy]] photography, is a technique to estimate [[solar radiation]] and characterize plant canopy geometry using photographs taken looking upward through an extreme wide-angle lens (Rich 1990).  Typically, the viewing angle approaches or equals 180-degrees, such that all sky directions are simultaneously visible.  The resulting photographs record the geometry of visible sky, or conversely the geometry of sky obstruction by plant canopies or other near-ground features.  This geometry can be measured precisely and used to calculate solar radiation transmitted through (or intercepted by) plant canopies, as well as to estimate aspects of canopy structure such as [[leaf area index]].  Detailed treatments of field and analytical methodology have been provided by Paul Rich (1989, 1990) and Robert Pearcy (1989).

==History of Hemispherical Photography==

The hemispherical lens (also known as a [[fisheye lens|fisheye]] or whole-sky lens) was originally designed by Robin Hill (1924) to view the entire sky for meteorological studies of cloud formation.  Foresters and ecologists conceived of using photographic techniques to study the light environment in forests by examining the [[forest canopy|canopy]] geometry.  In particular, Evans and Coombe (1959) estimated sunlight penetration through forest canopy openings by overlaying diagrams of the sun track on hemispherical photographs.  Later, Margaret Anderson (1964, 1971) provided a thorough theoretical treatment for calculating the transmission of direct and diffuse components of solar radiation through canopy openings using hemispherical photographs.  At that time hemispherical photograph analysis required tedious manual scoring of overlays of sky quadrants and the track of the sun.  With the advent of personal computers, researchers developed digital techniques for rapid analysis of hemispherical photographs (Chazdon and Field 1987, Rich 1988, 1989, 1990, Becker et al. 1989).  In recent years, researchers have started using digital cameras in favor of film cameras, and algorithms are being developed for automated image classification and analysis.  Various commercial software programs have become available for hemispherical photograph analysis, and the technique has been applied for diverse uses in [[ecology]], [[meteorology]], [[forestry]], and [[agriculture]].

==Applications of Hemispherical Photography==

Hemispherical photography has been used successfully in a broad range of applications involving microsite characterization and estimation of the solar radiation near the ground and beneath plant canopies.  For example, hemispherical photography has been used to characterize winter roosting sites for [[monarch butterflies]] (Weiss et al. 1991), effects of forest edges (Galo et al. 1991), influence of forest treefall gaps on tree regeneration (Rich et al. 1993), spatial and temporal variability of light in [[tropical rainforest]] understory (Clark et al. 1996), impacts of [[hurricanes]] on forest ecology (Bellingham et al. 1996), [[leaf area index]] for validation of [[remote sensing]] (Chen et al. 1997), canopy architecture of [[boreal forests]] (Fournier et al. 1997), light environment in old growth [[temperate rain forests]] (Weiss 2000), and management of [[vineyard trellises]] to make better [[wine]] (Weiss et al. 2003).

==Theory of Hemispherical Photography==

===Solar Radiation Calculations===

Direct and diffuse components of solar radiation are calculated separately (see [[Earth's radiation balance]]).  Direct radiation is calculated as the sum of all direct (solar beam) radiation originating from visible (non-obscured) sky directions along the path of the sun.  Similarly, diffuse solar radiation is calculated as the sum of all diffuse radiation (scattered from the atmosphere) originating from any visible (non-obscured) sky directions (see [[diffuse sky radiation]]).  The sum of direct and diffuse components gives global radiation.

These calculations require theoretical or empirical distributions of direct and diffuse radiation in the open, without canopy or other sky obstruction.  Usually calculations are performed for either [[photosynthetically active radiation]] (400-700 nanometers) or [[insolation]] integrated over all wavelengths, measured in kilowatt-hours per square meter (kW h/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

The fundamental assumption is that most solar radiation originates from visible (unobscured) sky directions, a strong first order effect, and that reflected radiation from the canopy or other near-ground features (non-visible or obscured sky directions) is negligible, a small second order effect.  Another assumption is that the geometry of visible (non-obscured) sky does not change over the period for which calculations are performed.

===Canopy Calculations===

Canopy indices, such as [[leaf area index]], are based on calculation of gap fraction, the proportion of visible (non-obscured) sky as a function of sky direction.  Leaf area index is typically calculated as the leaf area per unit ground area that would produce the observed gap fraction distribution, given an assumption of random leaf angle distribution, or a known leaf angle distribution and degree of clumping.  For further explanation see [[leaf area index]].

==Indices==

[[Image:Hemispherical photo1.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Hemispherical photograph used to study LAI, canopy closure, or other canopy indices.]]

'''Direct Site Factor (DSF)''' is the proportion of direct solar radiation at a given location relative to that in the open, either integrated over time or resolved according to intervals of time of day and/or season.

'''Indirect Site Factor (ISF)''' is the proportion of diffuse solar radiation at a given location relative to that in the open, either integrated over time for all sky directions or resolved by sky sector direction.

'''Global Site Factor (GSF)''' is the proportion of global solar radiation at a given location relative to that in the open, calculated as the sum of DSF and ISF weighted by the relative contribution of direct versus diffuse components.

Indices may be '''uncorrected''' or '''corrected''' for [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] relative to a flat intercepting surface.  Uncorrected values weight solar radiation originating from all directions equally.  Corrected values weight solar radiation by the cosine of the angle of incidence, accounting for actual interception from directions normal to the intercepting surface.

'''Leaf Area Index''' is the total leaf surface area per unit ground area.

==Methodology==

Hemispherical photography entails five steps: photograph acquisition, digitization, registration,  classification, and calculation.  Registration, classification, and calculation are accomplished using dedicated hemispherical photography analysis software.

===Photograph acquisition===

Upward-looking hemispherical photographs are typically acquired under uniform sky lighting, early or late in the day or under overcast conditions.  Known orientation (zenith and azimuth) is essential for proper registration with the analysis hemispherical coordinate system.  Even lighting is essential for accurate image classification.  A self-leveling mount (gimbals) can facilitate acquisition by ensuring that the camera is oriented to point straight up toward the zenith.  The camera is typically oriented such that north (absolute or magnetic) is oriented toward the top of the photograph.

The lens used in hemispherical photography is generally a [[Fisheye lens#Circular|circular fisheye lens]], such as the Nikkor 8mm fisheye lens. [[Fisheye lens#Full-frame|Full-frame fisheye lenses]] are ''not'' suitable for hemispherical photography, as they only capture a full 180° across the diagonal, and do not provide a complete hemispherical view.

In the early years of the technique, most hemispherical photographs were acquired with 35&amp;nbsp;mm cameras (e.g., Nikon FM2 with a Nikkor 8mm fisheye lens) using high contrast, high ASA black-and-white film.  Later, use of color film or slides became common.  Recently most photographs are acquired using digital cameras (e.g., Kodak DCS Pro 14nx with a Nikkor 8mm fisheye lens).

When images are acquired from locations with large differences in openness (for example, closed canopy locations and canopy gaps) it is essential to control camera exposure. If the camera is allowed to automatically adjust exposure (which is controlled by aperture and shutter speed), the result is that small openings in closed conditions will be bright, whereas openings of the same size in open conditions will be darker (for example, canopy areas around a gap). This means that during image analysis the same-sized holes will be interpreted as "sky" in a closed-canopy image and "canopy" in the open-canopy image. Without controlling exposure, the real differences between closed- and open-canopy conditions will be underestimated.

===Digitization===

Photographs are [[digitized]] and saved in standard image formats.  For film cameras this step requires a negative or slide scanner or a video digitizer.  For digital cameras this step occurs as photographs are acquired.

===Registration===

'''Photograph registration''' involves aligning the photographs with the hemispherical coordinate system used for analysis, in terms of translation (centering), size (coincidence of photograph edges and horizon in coordinate system), and rotation (azimuthal alignment with respect to compass directions).

===Classification===

'''Photograph classification''' involves determining which image [[pixels]] represent visible (non-obscured) versus non-visible (obscured) sky directions.  Typically this has been accomplished using interactive thresholding, whereby an appropriate threshold is selected to best match a binary classification with observed sky visibility, with pixel intensity values above the threshold classified as visible and pixel intensity values below the threshold classified as non-visible.  Recently advances have been made in developing automatic threshold algorithms, however more work is still needed before these are fully reliable.

===Calculation===

'''Hemispherical photograph calculation''' uses algorithms that compute gap fraction as function of sky direction, and compute desired canopy geometry and/or solar radiation indices.  For solar radiation, rapid calculation is often accomplished using pre-calculated lookup tables of theoretical or empirical solar radiation values resolved by sky sector or position in the sunpath.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11851">'''Heterotopia''' is a concept elaborated by philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] to describe certain cultural, institutional and discursive spaces that are somehow ‘other’:  disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory or transforming. Heterotopias are worlds within worlds, mirroring and yet upsetting what is outside. Foucault provides examples: ships, cemeteries, brothels, prisons, gardens of antiquity, fairs, Turkish baths and many more. Foucault outlines the notion of heterotopia on three occasions between 1966-67. A [https://foucault.info/documents/heterotopia/foucault.heteroTopia.en/ talk] given to a group of architects is the most well-known explanation of the term.  His first mention of the concept is in his ''preface'' to 'The Order of Things' and refers to texts rather than socio-cultural spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foucault |first=Michel |date=1971 |title=The Order of Things |location=New York |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-75335-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Heterotopia follows the template established by the notions of [[utopia]] and [[dystopia]]. The prefix hetero- is from Ancient Greek ἕτερος (héteros, "other, another, different") and is combined with the Greek morpheme τόπος ("place") and means "other place".  A utopia is an idea or an image that is not real but represents a perfected version of society, such as [[Utopia (book)|Thomas More's book]] or [[Le Corbusier]]'s drawings. As Walter Russell Mead has written, "Utopia is a place where everything is good; dystopia is a place where everything is bad; heterotopia is where things are different — that is, a collection whose members have few or no intelligible connections with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mead |first=Walter Russell |date=Winter 1995–1996 |title=Trains, Planes, and Automobiles: The End of the Postmodern Moment |url= |journal=World Policy Journal |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=13–31 |jstor=40209444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heterotopia in Foucault==
Foucault uses the term "heterotopia" ({{lang-fr|hétérotopie}}) to describe spaces that have more layers of meaning or relationships to other places than immediately meet the eye. In general, a heterotopia is a physical representation or approximation of a utopia, or a parallel space (such as a prison) that contains undesirable bodies to make a real utopian space impossible.

Foucault explains the link between utopias and heterotopias using the metaphor of a mirror. A mirror is a utopia because the image reflected is a 'placeless place', an unreal virtual place that allows one to see one's own visibility. However, the mirror is also a heterotopia, in that it is a real object. The heterotopia of the mirror 
is at once absolutely real, relating with the real space surrounding it, and absolutely unreal, creating a virtual image. 

Foucault articulates several possible types of heterotopia or spaces that exhibit dual meanings: 
* A ‘crisis heterotopia’ is a separate space like a boarding school or a motel room where activities like coming of age or a honeymoon take place out of sight. Foucault describes the crisis heterotopia as "reserved for individuals who are, in relation to society and to the human environment in which they live, in a state of crisis." He also points that crisis heterotopias are constantly disappearing from society and being replaced by the following heterotopia of deviation. 
* ‘Heterotopias of deviation’ are institutions where we place individuals whose behavior is outside the norm (hospitals, asylums, prisons, rest homes, cemetery).  
* Heterotopia can be a single real place that juxtaposes several spaces.  A garden can be a heterotopia, if it is a real space meant to be a microcosm of different environments, with plants from around the world. 
* 'Heterotopias of time' such as museums enclose in one place objects from all times and styles.  They exist in time but also exist outside of time because they are built and preserved to be physically insusceptible to time’s ravages. 
* 'Heterotopias of ritual or purification' are spaces that are isolated and penetrable yet not freely accessible like a public place. Either entry to the heterotopia is compulsory like in entering a prison, or entry requires special rituals or gestures, like in a [[sauna]] or a [[Turkish bath|hammam]].
* Heterotopia has a function in relation to all of the remaining spaces. The two functions are: heterotopia of illusion creates a space of illusion that exposes every real space, and the heterotopia of compensation is to create a real space—a space that is other.

Foucault's elaborations on heterotopias were published in an article entitled ''Des espaces autres'' (Of Other Spaces). The philosopher calls for a society with many heterotopias, not only as a space with several places of/for the affirmation of difference, but also as a means of escape from authoritarianism and repression, stating metaphorically that if we take the ship as the utmost heterotopia, a society without ships is inherently a repressive one, in a clear reference to [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foucault |first=Michel |date=October 1984 |title=Des Espace Autres |journal=Architecture, Mouvement, Continuité |volume=5 |pages=46–49}}; it has been translated into English twice, first as {{cite journal |last=Foucault |first=Michel |others=trans.

==Heterotopia in the work of other authors==
Human geographers often connected to the [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] school have been using the term (and the author's propositions) to help understand the contemporary emergence of (cultural, social, political, economic) difference and identity as a central issue in larger multicultural cities. The idea of ''place'' (more often related to ethnicity and gender and less often to the social class issue) as a heterotopic entity has been gaining attention in the current context of postmodern, post-structuralist theoretical discussion (and political practice) in Geography and other spatial social sciences. The concept of a heterotopia has also been discussed in relation to the space in which learning takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blair |first=Erik |date=2009 |title=A Further Education College as a Heterotopia |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13596740902717465 |journal=Research in Post-Compulsory Education |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=93–101 |doi=10.1080/13596740902717465}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an extensive debate with theorists, such as [[David Harvey]], that remain focused on the matter of class domination as the central determinant of social heteronomy.

The geographer [[Edward Soja]] has worked with this concept in dialogue with the works of [[Henri Lefebvre]] concerning urban space in the book ''Thirdspace''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Soja |first=Edward |date=1996 |title=Thirdspace: Journeys to Los Angeles and Other Real-and-Imagined Places |location=Malden, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |isbn=1-55786-675-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Franklin-Brown uses the concept of heterotopia in an epistemological context to examine the thirteenth century [[encyclopedia|encyclopedias]] of [[Vincent of Beauvais]] and [[Ramon Llull]]  as conceptual spaces where many possible ways of knowing are brought together without attempting to reconcile them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Franklin-Brown |first=Mary |date=2012 |title=Reading the World: Encyclopedic Writing in the Scholastic Age |location=Chicago, Ill. |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-26068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Media scholar Hye Jean Chung applies the concept of heterotopia to describe the multiple superimposed layers of spaciality and temporality observed in highly digitized audiovisual media. A heterotopic perception of digital media is, according to Chung, to grasp the globally dispersed labor structure of multinational capitalism that produces the audiovisual representations of various spacio-temporalities. &lt;ref&gt;Chung, Hye Jean. ''Media Heterotopias: Digital Effects and Material Labor in Global Film Production'', Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2018, pp.17-37 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Heterotopia in literature==
The concept of heterotopia has had a significant impact on literature, especially science fiction, fantasy and other [[Speculative fiction|speculative genres]]. Many readers consider the worlds of [[China Miéville]] and other [[weird fiction]] writers to be heterotopias insofar as they are worlds of radical difference transparent or of indifference to their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gordon |first=Joan |date=November 2003 |title=Hybridity, Heterotopia, and Mateship in China Miéville's ''Perdido Street Station'' |journal=Science Fiction Studies |publisher=SF-TH Inc., DePauw University |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=456–476 |jstor=4241204}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel R. Delany|Samuel Delany's]] 1976 novel ''[[Triton (novel)|Trouble on Triton]]'' is subtitled ''An Ambiguous Heterotopia'' and was written partly in dialogue with [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula K.

{{History of Tunisia}}
'''Ifriqiya''' or '''Ifriqiyah''' ({{Lang-ar|إفريقية}} ''{{transl|aeb|Ifrīqya}}'') or '''el-Maghrib el-Adna''' (Lower West) was the area during [[Middle Ages|medieval history]] that comprises what is today [[Tunisia]], [[Tripolitania]] (western [[Libya]]) and the [[Constantinois]] (eastern [[Algeria]]); all part of what was previously included in the [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Province]] of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/autre-region/Ifriqiya/124749 Article « Ifriqiya » (Larousse.fr)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern boundary of Ifriqiya was far more unchallenged as bounded by the semi-arid areas and the salt marshes called el-[[Djerid]]. The northern and western boundaries fluctuated; at times as far north as [[Sicily]] otherwise just along the coastline, and the western boundary usually went as far as [[Béjaïa]]. The capital was briefly [[Carthage]], then [[Kairouan|Qayrawan]] (Kairouan), then [[Mahdia]], then [[Tunis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Arabic_Thought_and_Its_Place_in_History : DE LACY O’LEARY, D.D. "ARABIC THOUGHT AND ITS PLACE IN HISTORY" London: KEGAN PAUL, TRENCH, TRUBNER &amp; CO., LTD. / NEW YORK: E. P. DUTTON &amp; CO. (1922), pp. 227-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabs generally settled on the lower ground while the native population settled in the mountains.{{citation needed|reason=Roman ruins after the conquest do not seem to go with this hypothesis and the native urban population outnumbered by many times the immigrants (arabs-egyptians-levantine-persians)|date=November 2015}}

The [[Aghlabids]], from their base in [[Kairouan]], initiated the invasion of [[Sicily]] beginning in 827 and establishing the [[Emirate of Sicily]], which lasted until it was conquered by the Normans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3545">{{distinguish|James McQueen (disambiguation)}}
'''James Macqueen''' (1778-1870) — sometimes '''MacQueen''' — was a Scottish geographer, statistician, political campaigner, pro-slavery and pro-Empire activist, banker and businessman, noted for founding the [[Colonial Bank (West Indies)|Colonial Bank]] and the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]]. An expert on [[African geography]], he advocated the colonisation of that continent many decades before the so-called "[[Scramble for Africa]]" (1881-1914). He was co-owner and editor of the ''[[Glasgow Courier (Scottish newspaper)|Glasgow Courier]]''; wrote in London on politics, geography, economics, and general literature; and founded a bank in [[Mauritius]].

Although Macqueen had no academic education, professional training or qualifications, his amateur energy and enthusiasm, in several fields, made him a prominent, and controversial figure. He quickly lost interest in many of the projects he started. He had extensive correspondence with the [[Royal Geographical Society]], and many of his memoirs were published in its ''Journal'' and ''Proceedings''.

==Biography==
Macqueen was born in [[Crawford, South Lanarkshire|Crawford]], [[Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]], in 1778 and had become manager of a [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar estate]] on [[Grenada]] by 1797. The [[British Admiralty]] postal [[sailing brig]]s were considered to be slow and unreliable by the colonial community, so on his return to Glasgow in 1830 he started a campaign for a [[steamship]] mail service to the [[West Indies]]. The government eventually decided to fund the project, and in 1839 the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company was granted a [[royal charter]]. In 1840 the Admiralty awarded it a contract to deliver mail to the West Indian colonies, with the first departure from [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], on 3 January 1842. The mail network expanded and the company operated services within the West Indies and to New York and [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]].

Macqueen died on 14 May 1870 at 10 Norton Street, [[Kensington]] (some sources say at Bury Street, [[St James, London|St James]]). He died, aged 92, in poverty, and his 59 year old widow Jean was forced to survive on charitable handouts from fellows of the Royal Geographical Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Racine|first1=Karen|title=The Human Tradition in the Atlantic World, 1500–1850|date=2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IOR5bOpGUiQC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;lpg=PA220&amp;dq=macqueen+colonial+bank&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eRPS6sRdtD&amp;sig=HoH6pEHCHHv6YNFU_aldFgmk9Zg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin7dXLsv3RAhXoFZoKHSbADLUQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=macqueen%20colonial%20bank&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kirsty Ellen Duncan''' {{postnom|country=CAN|PC|MP}} (born October 31, 1966) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician and [[Health geography|medical geographer]] from [[Ontario]], Canada. Duncan is the Member of Parliament (MP) for the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] in the [[Toronto]] riding of [[Etobicoke North]] and was appointed [[Minister of Science (Canada)|Minister of Science]], on the advice of Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]], on November 4, 2015. In January 2018, she also became [[Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities]].

She is also currently an adjunct professor at the [[University of Toronto]] and has published a book about her 1998 expedition to uncover the cause of the 1918 [[Spanish flu]] epidemic.

==Education==
After graduating from [[Kipling Collegiate Institute]] in 1985 as an Ontario Scholar, Duncan studied geography and anthropology at the [[University of Toronto]]. She then entered graduate school at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]], and completed a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in geography in 1992.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/canada-s-top-scientist-faces-tough-challenge-1.19075 | title=Canada’s top scientist faces tough challenge | publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | date=24 December 2015 | accessdate=2015-12-23 | author=Jones, Nicola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 1993 to 2000, Duncan taught meteorology, climatology and climate change at the [[University of Windsor]]. In 1992, as she became aware of the increasing probability of a global flu crisis, she was led to investigate the cause of the similar 1918 [[Spanish flu]] pandemic, saying, "I was horrified we didn’t know what caused [Spanish flu], and also knew that if we could find fragments of the virus, we might be able to find a better flu vaccine".&lt;ref name="national"&gt;{{cite news |title=Digging up the deadly past |url=http://www.thenational.ae/article/20080925/FRONTIERS/359618327/ |publisher=Martin Newland |work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |date=2008-09-25 |accessdate=2009-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gladwell|first1=Malcolm|title=The Dead Zone|journal=The New Yorker|url=http://gladwell.com/the-dead-zone/|date=September 29, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though at the time she "knew nothing about influenza",&lt;ref name="hunting"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus |last=Duncan |first=Kirsty |year=2003 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-0-8020-8748-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; she began what she called a "six-month crash course in [[virology]]".&lt;ref name="hunting"/&gt; Eventually, she began searching for possible frozen samples of lung and brain tissue that might contain the virus. Her initial thoughts led her to think of [[Alaska]],&lt;ref name="hunting"/&gt; as it contains large areas of [[permafrost]], which would leave the viruses intact, but the search proved fruitless.

Eventually, after several years of searching, Duncan learned of seven miners who had died from the Spanish flu and were buried in the small town of [[Longyearbyen]], [[Norway]], an area that would contain permafrost. She then began assembling a team of scientists to accompany her. After several more years of preparation, which involved garnering various permissions to perform the exhumations, the ground survey began in 1998. However, the samples were not viable, as the bodies were not in the permafrost, and the expedition ultimately proved a disappointment.&lt;ref name="national"/&gt;

In 2003, Duncan wrote a book about her expedition, entitled ''Hunting the 1918 Flu: One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus''. Published by the [[University of Toronto Press]], it details Duncan's process and the expedition itself. After the book's publication, Duncan began speaking about pandemics, which led her to begin teaching corporate social responsibility at the University of Toronto's [[Rotman School of Management]]. In 2008, Duncan published a second book, ''Environment and Health: Protecting our Common Future''.

Duncan is currently an adjunct professor teaching both medical geography at the [[University of Toronto]] and global environmental processes at [[Royal Roads University]], and served on the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], an organization that won the 2007 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] with [[Al Gore]].

In 2018 the [[University of Edinburgh]] awarded her an [[honorary degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-administration/graduations/honorary/future-honorary-grads|title=Honorary Graduates in 2018|work=The University of Edinburgh|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal politics==

In February 2008, [[Roy Cullen]] announced that he would not be running in the next federal election,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Election call expected Sunday |last=Shephard |first=Tamara |url=http://www.insidetoronto.ca/News/Etobicoke/article/55157 |publisher=[[Metroland Media Group]] |work=Toronto Community News |date=2008-09-04 |accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Duncan was appointed as the next Liberal candidate. She was considered a "significant addition toward Dion's goal of fielding 103 women candidates in the next election."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dion hand-picks Etobicoke candidate |last=Delacourt |first=Susan |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/305911 |publisher=[[Jagoda Pike]] |work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2008-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 general election]] and re-elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011]] and [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015]] general elections.

On November 4, 2015, Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] appointed her to the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] as Minister of Science.&lt;ref name="appointment"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/full-list-of-justin-trudeau-s-cabinet-1.3300699| title=Full list of Justin Trudeau's cabinet | publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] | date=4 November 2015 | accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan was tasked with establishing the new position of chief science officer that would serve as a replacement to the position of national science adviser role eliminated by [[Stephen Harper]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In January 2018, she also became [[Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities]], after the resignation of her predecessor, [[Kent Hehr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/3986503/kent-hehr-sexual-harassment-allegations/|title=Kent Hehr resigns from Liberal cabinet over sexual harassment allegations|work=Global News|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7175">'''Luiza Bialasiewicz''' (born 14 August 1971, [[Warsaw]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://albumacademicum.uva.nl Prof. dr. L.A. Bialasiewicz] at the UvA ''Album Academicum" website&lt;/ref&gt;is an Italian [[political geography|political geographer]] (from Polish descent) and Jean Monnet Professor of EU External Relations in the Department of European Studies at the [[University of Amsterdam]]. Before moving to Amsterdam in 2011, she was Senior Lecturer in the Department of Geography at [[Royal Holloway]], and prior to that, Lecturer in the Department of Geography at the [[University of Durham]]. Bialasiewicz obtained her Ph.D. from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].

== Research interests ==
Bialasiewicz's work focuses on the political geographies of European integration and on European borders, with a particular focus on the 'geographical imaginations' of European belonging, within and beyond the territorial confines of Europe, and the role of Europe in the wider world. Her most recent research has examined EU border management and EU geopolitics, looking specifically at the role of third states in the 'out-sourcing' of EU border controls in the Mediterranean. Her work also engages with the historical geographies of Mediterranean cities, [[Trieste]], [[Tangiers]] and [[Alexandria]] in particular.

'''Maniava waterfall''' ({{lang-uk|Манявський водоспад}}) is the highest [[waterfall]] in the [[Carpathians]] and is located in the [[Gorgany]] mountain ridge in [[Ukraine]]. 

==Geography==
Maniava waterfall is located on the Maniavka river, about {{convert|8|km}} south of [[Maniava]], [[Bohorodchanskyi Raion]], [[Ivano-Frankivska oblast]].&lt;ref name=carpathian&gt;{{cite web|title=waterfalls - Ukrainian-Polish Tourist Portal|url=http://www.tourism-carpathian.com.ua/en/attractions/vodospady.php|publisher=tourism-carpathian.com|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carpathiansoutdoors&gt;{{cite web|title=An easy Carpathian hike: castle, waterfalls, monastery. - Hiking ...|url=http://carpathiansoutdoors.com/en/tour/view/35|publisher=carpathiansoutdoors.com|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is nearly {{convert|20|m}} high. Near the waterfall is a canyon that is approximately {{convert|200|m}} long with rocks up to {{convert|20|m}} high.

==Overview==
The waterfall also boasts a small lake, where the water remains cool even in hot season. Fir and beech forests line the waterfall creating a very beautiful and tranquil environment. The waterfall turns a little wild following heavy rainfall or the monsoon with frequent flash floods. In winter months frozen ice appear like chimeras with an enchanting effect on the visitors who frequent the place, now and again.&lt;ref name=waterfall&gt;{{cite web|title=Maniava Waterfall|url=http://rtic.if.ua/en/objects/c1/1243.html|publisher=rtic.if.ua|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''military sketching board''' was designed to be used on horseback. The board incorporates a compass, an inclinometer, a ruler, a roll of paper and an arm buckle.

==Description==
The board was designed to be strapped to the arm of a cavalryman on the arm that he held the horses bridle with.&lt;ref name=india&gt;{{cite book|title=The India List and India Office List|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2NPAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=cavalry+sketch+verner&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=India Office|page=21|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board is attached to the leather buckle with a swivel joint. This means that the user can twist the whole board on their arm to ensure that the compass alignment is clear.&lt;ref name=verner/&gt; The board incorporates a compass for this purpose. The user can then use the supplied ruler. In earlier versions this was attached with rubber bands but later versions had the ruler permanently attached. The paper was about {{convert|2|or|3|ft|spell=in}} long and was rolled around one of the side rollers. As a sketch was completed then the paper roll was advanced to supply more clear paper. On the back of the board is an [[Inclinometer]] to allow the severity of ascents to be recorded.&lt;ref name=verner/&gt;

==History==
The board was originally designed by Colonel W H Richards, who taught military surveying at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in about 1880 before he went on to teach in India.&lt;ref name=nuss&gt;{{cite book|last=Aḥmad|first=Naz̲īr|title=The repentance of Nussooh|year=1884|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GLgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=sandhurst+W+H+Richards+cavalry&amp;dq=sandhurst+W+H+Richards+cavalry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=REiRUcb-M8uGhQf364H4Dw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBDgK}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The board was improved by Major (later Colonel) [[William Willoughby Cole Verner]] who had briefly Professor of Topography at the Sandhurst. He patented improvements in 1887 and 1891 and the board became known as ''Verner's''. Verner published his own guide to the sketching board in 1889.&lt;ref name=verner&gt;Verner, William Willoughby Cole.
Rapid field sketching and reconnaissance. London, 1889&lt;/ref&gt; However the board was not universally loved and some referred to it as ''"The damnable cavalry sketching board"''.&lt;ref name=diana/&gt;

In the 1930s very similar devices were used by solo aviators. The device was strapped to the arm or leg and was loaded with maps rather than sketching paper.&lt;ref name=diana&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webster|first=Diana|title=An Unusual Survey Equipment|journal=AIRT|date=January 2007|volume=10|page=6|url=http://www.nls.uk/media/22596/cairt10.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these devices is in the collection of the [[National Museums of Scotland]].

A '''notice to mariners''' (NTM&lt;ref&gt;Web site uses abbreviation NTM&lt;/ref&gt;) advises mariners of important matters affecting navigational safety, including new [[Hydrography|hydrographic information]], changes in [[channel (geography)|channel]]s and aids to [[navigation]], and other important data.

Over 60 countries which produce nautical charts also
produce a notice to mariners. About one third of these are
weekly, another third are bi-monthly or monthly, and the
rest irregularly issued according to need. For example, the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office]] issues weekly updates.

==United States==

The U.S. ''Notice to Mariners'' is made available weekly by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA), prepared jointly with the [[National Ocean Service]] (NOS) and the [[U.S. Coast Guard]]. The information in the ''Notice to Mariners'' is formatted to simplify the correction of [[nautical chart|paper charts]], ''[[List of Lights]]'', ''[[Light List]]s'', ''[[United States Coast Pilots]]'', and other publications produced by NGA, NOS, and the U.S. Coast Guard.

Information for the ''Notice to Mariners'' is contributed
by: the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (Department of Defense) for waters
outside the territorial limits of the United States; National
Ocean Service ([[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]],
[[Department of Commerce]]), which is charged
with surveying and charting the coasts and harbors of the
United States and its territories; the U.S. Coast Guard ([[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]) which is responsible for the safety of life at sea and the establishment and operation of aids to navigation; and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] ([[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]), which is charged with the
improvement of rivers and harbors of the United States. In
addition, important contributions are made by foreign hydrographic
offices and cooperating observers of all
nationalities.

The Notice consists of a page of Hydrograms listing
important items in the Notice, a chart correction
section organized by ascending chart number, a product catalog corrections section, a publications
correction section, a summary of broadcast
navigation warnings, and a page of additional miscellaneous information. It is the responsibility of users to decide which of their
charts and publications require correction.
Mariners are requested to cooperate in the correction of
charts and publications by reporting all discrepancies between
published information and conditions actually
observed and by recommending appropriate improvements. A reporting form is provided in the back of each
''Notice to Mariners''.

Issue No. 1 of each year contains important
information on a variety of subjects which supplements
information not usually found on charts and in navigational
publications. This information is published as Special Notice
to Mariners Paragraphs. Additional items considered
of interest to the mariner are also included in this Notice.

Much of the data
in the U.S. ''Notice to Mariners'' is obtained from foreign
notices.

==Canada==
In Canada, the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/ Notice to Mariners] publication informs mariners of important navigational safety matters affecting Canadian Waters.  This electronic publication is published on a monthly basis and can be downloaded from the [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/go.php?doc=eng/services/notmar/index Notices to Mariners (NOTMAR) Web site].  The information in the Notice to Mariners is formatted to simplify the correction of paper charts and navigational publications.

The [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/ NOTMAR.gc.ca] site is a free 24/7 service providing mariners with up-to-date safety advisories.   It provides mariners with a quick and easy to use interface to access Notices to Mariners information. This system also generates [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/search/mycharts-eng.php?czozMDoibnRtPXN0ZXBfb25lc3RhcnQmYWNjZXB0cHJpdj0xIjs= weekly and monthly notification mailers], for its registered users.  These on-line mail services provides the [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/subscribe/ monthly Notices to Mariners publications] as well as the weekly(section II - chart corrections) notices that advise the mariner of the notices that have been issued against their chart selections.  These mail services simplify the process for registered clients to update their publications and charts as required under the Canada Shipping Act.

The NOTMAR web site also includes the [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/go.php?doc=eng/services/notmar/numindex historical Chart corrections] and [http://www.notmar.gc.ca/go.php?doc=eng/services/notmar/sec4index historical Sailing Direction corrections]; as well, it provides access to downloadable Chart Patches, contains links to CHS’s Chart Number 1, instructions for applying Notices to mariners to manually update their paper charts, and other useful information.

==Summary of Corrections==
A close companion to the ''Notice to Mariners'' is the '''[http://msi.nga.mil/MSISiteContent/StaticFiles/SOCDownloadPage.htm Summary of Corrections]'''. The ''Summary'' is published in five volumes. Each volume covers a major portion of the earth including several chart regions and many subregions.  Volume 5 also includes special charts and publications corrected
by the ''Notice to Mariners''. Since the Summaries contain cumulative corrections, any chart, regardless of its print date, can be corrected with the proper volume of the Summary and all subsequent ''Notice to Mariners''.

A '''stabilized liquid membrane device''' or '''SLMD''' is a type of [[Environmental monitoring|passive sampling device]] which allows for the [[In situ|in situ]], integrative collection of waterborne, [[Lability|labile]] ionic metal contaminants.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;Brumbaugh, W.G., Petty, J.D., Huckins, J.N., Manahan, S.E. 2002. Stabilized liquid membrane device (SLMD) for the passive, integrative sampling of labile metals in water. Water, Air, Soil Pollut. 133, 109–119.&lt;/ref&gt; By capturing and sequestering metal ions onto its surface continuously over a period of days to weeks, an SLMD can provide an integrative measurement of [[Bioavailability|bioavailable]] toxic metal ions present in the aqueous environment.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;Petty, J.D., Brumbaugh, W.G., Huckins, T.W.M., Wiedmeyer, R. 2001. US Patent No. US006296760B1.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they have been used in conjunction with other passive samplers in ecological field studies.&lt;ref name=a4&gt;2012. Potential Causes for Impairment of Rainbow Trout Early Life stages and Loss of Benthic Biodiversity in Indian Creek. Washington State Department of Ecology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a7&gt;Brumbaugh, W.G., May, W.T., Besser, J.M., Allert, A.L., Schmitt, C.J. 2008. Assessment of Elemental Concentrations in Streams of the New Lead Belt in Southeastern Missouri, 2002-05. Scientific Investigations Report 2007-5057.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Passive samplers were first developed in the early 1970s to monitor concentrations of airborne contaminants industrial workers might be exposed to, but by the 1990s researchers had developed and utilized passive samplers to monitor contaminants in the aqueous environment.&lt;ref name=a2&gt;Alvarez, D. 2013. Development of Semipermeable Membrane Devices (SPMDs) and Polar Organic Integrative Samplers (POCIS) for Environmental Monitoring. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. 23: 2179–2181.&lt;/ref&gt; The first type of passive sampler made for use in the aqueous environment was the [[Semipermeable membrane devices|semipermeable membrane device]] (SPMD).&lt;ref name=a2&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; SPMDs could be used to determine time-weighted average concentrations of [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] organic contaminants, but until the early 2000s passive sampling devices for metal contaminants had not yet emerged.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Metals in the environment can speciate into different forms. Most metals dissolved in the aqueous environment are present as any of several ionic, complex-ion, and organically bound states.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For most toxic metals, bioavailability is greatest for labile metals in their free ionic state.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing the potential usefulness of a passive sampling device that could be used to measure trace amounts of bioavailable toxic metals, researchers at the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) and [[University of Missouri-Columbia]] began development on a counterpart to SPMDs that could be used to sample for labile metals.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and function ==
The outer portion of a SLMD consists of a section of sealed, flat, semi-permeable polyethylene tubing. Sealed inside this tubing is a 1:1 mixture of a hydrophobic [[Chelation|metal complexing agent]] and a long chain [[Organic acid|organic acid]].&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The organic acid diffuses through the tubing to the outer surface, where the [[carboxylic acid]] portion can form stable complexes with calcium and magnesium ions in the water.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This allows a waxy layer to slowly accumulate on the outside of the tube. the metal complexing agent continuously mobilizes into this waxy layer, where it can sequester metal ions from the water.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The hydrophobic metal complexing agent most commonly used in SLMDs is an [[Alkylation|alkylated]] 8-hyroxyquinoline.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oleic acid]] is commonly used as the other half of the 1:1 hydrophobic reagent mixture, as it readily forms calcium oleates in the aqueous sampling media.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the base device, hydrophobic plastic sheaths are sometimes used to house SLMDs in the field.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Variable water flow can alter the sampling rates of metals by SLMDs, making a time-averaged concentration difficult to determine.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By allowing liable metal analytes to diffuse to the SLMD's surface while limiting the diffusion of particulate, [[colloidal]], or humic substances, these hydrophobic sheaths help reduce variability of SLMD uptake in faster moving waters.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After being deployed for a known time interval, SLMDs can be recovered from the field for analysis. Washing with 20% [[nitric acid]] allows for the extraction of accumulated metals, and by using analytical techniques like [[Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry|inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy]] (ICP-MS) or [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy|atomic absorption spectroscopy]] (flame AAS)  to measure the concentration of metal in the extract, the amount of metal accumulated by the SLMD can be determined.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
SLMDs are known to accumulate [[cadmium]], [[cobalt]], [[copper]], [[nickel]], [[lead]], and [[zinc]],&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and have been deployed in freshwater monitoring studies by The Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology)&lt;ref name=a4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the USGS.&lt;ref name=a6&gt;United States Geological Society (USGS) Columbia Environmental Research Center. May 2004. Retrieved 5/28/2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ecology deployed SLMDs in upper and lower Indian Creek for 28 and 27 days respectively.&lt;ref name=a4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Metal concentrations on the SLMDs were used to estimate the true concentration of metals in the creek. The estimated concentration was expressed as a range based on sampling rate of SLMDs as well as the length of exposure. The purpose of the sampling was to investigate potential causes of sublethal effects of young trout and loss of benthic biodiversity in the creek.&lt;ref name=a4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and limitations ==
Toxic metals can be present in the aqueous environment at [[Trace element|trace]] or ultra-trace concentrations, yet still be toxicologically significant and thus cause harm to humans or the environment.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because these concentrations are so low, they would fall beyond the [[detection limit]]s of most analytical instruments if the media had been sampled using traditional grab samples.&lt;ref name=a3&gt;Petty, J.D., Huckins, J.N. Alvarez, D.A., Brumbaugh, W.G., Cranor W.L., Gale, R.W., Rastall, A.C., Jones-Lepp T.L., Leiker T.J., Rostad C.E., Furlong E.T., 2004. A holistic passive integrative sampling approach for assessing the presence and potential impacts of waterborne environmental contaminants. Chemosphere 54, 695-709.&lt;/ref&gt; Using SLMDs to passively collect metals over an extended period of time allows for trace metals to accumulate to detectable levels, which can give more accurate estimate of aquatic chemistry and contamination.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; SLMDs also have the advantage of being able to capture pulses of metal contamination that might otherwise go undetected when using [[Grab sample|grab samples]].&lt;ref name=a4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
SLMDs are limited to the assessment of labile metals, and cannot be used to monitor for [[Organic compound|organic contaminants]]. Further, while the ability of SLMDs to sample copper, zinc, nickel, lead, and cadmium has been repeatedly demonstrated,&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a7&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; there has been little laboratory research on their ability to reliably uptake other toxic metals. Still, while laboratory studies on the effectiveness of SLMDs have only investigated copper, zinc, nickel, lead, and cadmium, SLMDs have been used with success in field studies to assess a wider range of metals.&lt;ref name=a4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7956">'''Stocksundet''' is a [[strait]] in [[Stockholm County]] in [[Sweden]]. It connects the [[Edsviken]] sea inlet, to the west, with the [[Lilla Värtan]] strait and eventually the [[Baltic sea]], to the east. The strait also forms the border between the suburb of [[Stocksund]] in [[Danderyd Municipality]], to the north, and the suburb of [[Bergshamra, Solna|Bergshamra]] in [[Solna Municipality]], to the south. The strait is approximately {{convert|2|km}} long and varies in width between {{convert|90|m}} and {{convert|250|m}}, whilst its depth varies between {{convert|6|m}} and {{convert|15|m}}. 

Stocksundet is supposed to have received its name from the [[logging|log]]s (Swedish: "stock") which used to be laid out in the water to stop invading ships in the early Middle Ages. This name then led to the place name of ''Stocksund'', on the north side of the sound, and to the heraldry shield of the then Stocksund Municipality between 1955 and 1966.{{cite needed|reason=Looks like it has been translated by a previous editor from WP:SV, but that doesn't have a cite for this either|date=August 2017}}

By the 1400s, the road between Roslagen and Stockholm crossed Stocksundet, and by the 17th century, a [[ferry]] was provided. In 1716 the first bridge across the Stocksundet was built, principally to facilitate the movement of troops to the west in the event of an attack by [[Russia]]. Since then, there have been a total of seven bridges built across the strait.&lt;ref name=Stocksund&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lottero.se/Stockholm/danderyd.htm |title=Danderyd |language=Swedish |work=www.lottero.se |accessdate=27 August 2017 |archivedate=27 August 2017 |deadurl=no  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827155856/http://www.lottero.se/Stockholm/danderyd.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bridges==

[[File:Neue Stocksundbrücke.jpg|thumb|The new railway bridge for the Roslagsbanan over Stocksundet.]]
From west to east, the strait is spanned by a bridge for the [[Stockholm metro]], a road bridge for the [[European route E18]], and a bridge for the [[Roslagsbanan]] narrow gauge commuter railway. Over time there have been seven bridges across the Stocksundet:

* The first bridge was built in 1716 the first bridge was built. It was a [[Pontoon bridge|floating bridge]] with a [[drawbridge]] that could be opened to allow boat traffic to pass. Despite needing frequent repairs, the bridge lasted until September 1824, when it was destroyed in a violent storm.&lt;ref name=Stocksund/&gt;{{sfn|Andrén et al.|2011|p=57}}

* In 1825-1826 a new {{convert|90|m|adj=on}} long bridge was built in five sections between stone [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]] and including a [[swing bridge|swing section]]. The bridge was superseded as a road bridge with the opening of a new bridge in 1936, but remained in use a pedestrian and bicycle bridge until the winter of 1957/8. The land ends of the bridge are still visible, along with the bridge house.&lt;ref name=Stocksund/&gt;{{sfn|Stocksunds Köping|Folke Rengmark|1963|p=80}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kulturmiljöhandbok för Danderyds kommun |volume=2:a upplagan |year=2003 |pages=167,166 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1885 a railway bridge was constructed to carry the [[narrow gauge]] [[Roslagsbanan]]. The bridge carried a [[Single-track railway|single track]], and was {{convert|98|m|adj=on}} long, and comprised two fixed spans of {{convert|36.6|m}} together with a {{convert|25|m|adj=on}} [[swing bridge|pivoting span]]. This bridge was replaced by a new bridge, on a different alignment, in 1996, and was demolished two years later. One of the bridge piers still exists within the stait, and the land ends of the bridge are visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historiskt.nu/smalsp/srj/sr_j/sr_j_fakta.html |work=Historiskt |title=Järnvägshistorik: Linjen Stockholm Östra – Rimbo |accessdate=27 August 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827164403/http://www.historiskt.nu/smalsp/srj/sr_j/sr_j_fakta.html |archivedate=27 August 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Andrén et al.|2011|p=64}}

* Between 1934 and 1936, a modern [[concrete]] arch bridge was built a little further west than the 1826 road bridge. It had a span of {{convert|90|m}} and was {{convert|16|m}} wide, carrying two {{convert|1.5|m|adj=on}} walkways, two {{convert|2|m|adj=on}} bicycle lanes, and a {{convert|9|m|adj=on}} carriageway. This bridge had a relatively short life, and was replaced in 1990, being demolished in order to make way for its replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://runeberg.org/tektid/1936v/0067.html |title=Technical Journal / 1936. Road and Water Engineering |work=Project Runeberg |accessdate=27 August 2017 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Andrén et al.|2011|p=59}}

* In 1978 a bridge was built to carry the extension of the [[Stockholm metro]] to [[Mörby centrum metro station|Mörby centrum station]]. The bridge is {{convert|240|m}} long, and consists of a four-span curved concrete structure, with a navigation clearance of {{convert|13|m}}. The bridge carries twin tracks, and the line runs in tunnel at each end of the bridge.{{cite needed|reason=I translated this from WP:SV, which uses a cite of ''Eniro sjökort'', but I cannot locate this|date=August 2017}}

* By the 1980s, the 1936 road bridge was no longer able to carry the increasingly intensive road traffic, and it was decided to replace it with two new parallel bridges for the Norrtälje road (E18) (one for north and one for south-traffic). The first of these bridges was completed in 1990, enabling the 1936 bridge to be demolished to make way for the second new bridge, which opened in 1992. The bridges have two large and one small span each, with the largest span of {{convert|122|m}}, with a navigation clearance of {{convert|12|m}}. The bridges are respectively {{convert|15.5|m}} and {{convert|19.5|m}} wide, carrying three northbound and four southbound lanes, together with pedestrian and cycle facilities.{{sfn|Andrén et al.|2011|p=59-61}}

* In 1996 a new railway bridge was built for the Roslagsbanan, located {{convert|100|m}} west of the 1885 bridge, as part of the reconstruction of the line to [[Double-track railway|double track]]. The new alignment necessitated the relocation of [[Stocksund railway station|Stocksund station]]. The new bridge was designed by architect {{ill|Laszlo Marko|sv}} and is a concrete structure with four spans. It is {{convert|215|m}} long and has a navigation clearance of {{convert|8|m}}, somewhat lower than the adjacent road and metro bridges.{{cite needed|reason=I translated this from WP:SV, which uses a cite of ''Eniro sjökort'', but I cannot locate this|date=August 2017}}

Eswatini is divided into four regions:
* [[Hhohho Region|Hhohho]]
* [[Lubombo Region|Lubombo]]
* [[Manzini Region|Manzini]]
* [[Shiselweni Region|Shiselweni]]

Each region is further divided into [[tinkhundla]]. There are 55 tinkhundla in Swaziland and each elects one representative to the [[House of Assembly of Swaziland]]. Tinkhundla are, in turn, divided into smaller [[Umphakatsi|imiphakatsi]].

'''Toubkal''' or '''Tubkal''' ([[Berber language|Berber]]: ⵜⵓⴳⴳ ⴽⴰⵍ ''Tugg kal''; {{lang-ar|توبقال}} ''Tūbqāl'') is a [[mountain]] peak in southwestern [[Morocco]], located in the [[Toubkal National Park]]. At 
{{convert|4167|m|ft|0}}, it is the highest peak in the [[Atlas Mountains]], [[Morocco]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Arab World]]. It is an [[ultra prominent peak]], the highest for over 2000 km, located 63&amp;nbsp;km south of the city of [[Marrakesh]], and a popular destination for climbers.

[[Image:Atlas Mountains snow cover.jpg|thumb|left|The highest peak of Toubkal]]
The first recorded ascent was on 12 June 1923 by the Marquis de Segonzac, Vincent Berger and Hubert Dolbeau, but the mountain may have been climbed before that date.&lt;ref name=collomb&gt;Robin G. Collomb, ''Atlas Mountains'', Goring: West Col, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

Trekkers usually approach the mountain from the road-end village of [[Imlil, Atlas Mountains|Imlil]]. Qualified guides can be hired, as well as porters, to carry equipment and food supplies higher into the mountains. For experienced mountaineers, guides are not required for the normal route, as it is a moderate hike and orientation is not a problem.

The normal route starts with an easy walk to the village of [[Aroumd]]. Past Aroumd a [[floodplain]] is crossed and the route follows the left slope of the valley southwards. The valley bends to the east to the tiny settlement of Sidi Chamharouch, which has grown around a Muslim shrine. At Sidi Chamharouch, the path leads over the stream and runs steeply uphill to the right side of the Isougouane valley, which leads to two stone-built refuges (old Neltner Refuge and new Refuge du Toubkal) that are often used as base camp at {{convert|3207|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. It is possible to buy good meals in the Refuge du Toubkal. Tents can be pitched near the refuges for a small charge.

From that point a path crosses the stream, climbs a steep [[scree]] slope to the east and enters a valley ([[Cirque|corrie]]), then climbs another steep slope to reach a [[Mountain pass|col]] (Tizi'n'Toubkal at 3,940m). At the col the route turns left (northwards) to the summit ridge of Jbel Toubkal. The 4,167m summit is crowned with a curious pyramidal metal frame and views take in most of the Atlas and [[Little Atlas]] Mountains.

The ascent during the summer (from May) is non-technical yet moderately difficult, only complicated by steep and slippery scree slopes and [[altitude sickness]]. Sturdy boots and proper (windproof) clothing are required, and [[trekking poles]] are helpful on the scree. An [[Ice axe|ice-axe]] may be needed on the remaining snowfields in the early summer. The ascent during the end of the winter and spring (February/March) is more difficult. [[Crampons]] are necessary to ascend through the snow and - in some cases - ice.

It is possible to climb the mountain in two days - first day up to the refuge (around seven hours), second day to the summit (around five hours) and back to Imlil (up to five hours).

In summer the mountains can be very dry, but are sometimes subject to storms. Although the temperature should remain above zero during the day, freezing conditions are possible over 3,500m. In winter the mountains are covered in snow and ice, and can be prone to avalanches. Skiing is possible as the snow can lie to considerable depth and cover many rocky slopes. Information about the state of the route can be obtained at Marrakech tourist offices or at Imlil.

'''The Tricity''' is an area of Nepal that comprises the cities of [[Baglung]], [[Beni, Dhawalagiri|Beni]] and [[Kushma]] as core market centers. The three cities are headquarters of Myagdi, Baglung and Parbat districts respectively. [[Baglung]] also happens to be the headquarters of Dhaulagiri zone. The Trinity area is a major center of population and economic activity in West-central Nepal.  As three district headquarters and the zonal headquarter are located in the valley there is a large concentration of governmental and nongovernmental offices, banks, educational institutes, cottage industries and healthcare centers.
Geographically,  50&amp;nbsp;km long, region of [[Kali Gandaki]] valley stretching from Galeshwor to the north to Phalewas to the south can be considered the Tricity region.

The '''Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis''' (CASA) is a research centre at [[University College London]] (UCL) which specialises in the application and visualisation of [[Spatial analysis|spatial analytic]] techniques and simulation models to cities and regions.

== History ==

CASA was established in 1995 by a group of UCL academics who wanted a focus for their research across different academic departments in the field of [[geographic information system]]s (GIS). [[Michael Batty]] was appointed the first director and initially held a joint appointment as Professor of Spatial Analysis and Planning in the Departments of Geography and [[The Bartlett]] School of Planning. He is now Chairman of the Centre.  In 2000, Paul Longley was appointed Deputy Director and Professor of Geographic Information Science. He now directs UCL's ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0214/06022014ucl-big-data UCL and Big Data: Funding announcement] (dated 6 February 2014). Accessed 6 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; CASA is still largely funded through research grants but from 2010 it began to diversify, introducing Masters programmes in spatial analysis and in Smart Cities. Professor Andrew Hudson-Smith took over the directorship in 2011 and appointed a Deputy Director, Dr Adam Dennet, in 2016. The Masters courses developed since 2010 include the [http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa/programmes/postgraduate/msc-smart-cities-and-urban-analytics MSc in Smart Cities and Urban Analytics] and the [http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa/programmes/postgraduate/mres-spatial-data-science-visualisation MRes in Data Science and Visualisation]. It currently has 6 lecturers and 2 teaching fellows leading its courses. Sir [[Alan Wilson (academic)|Alan Wilson]] was appointed Professor of Urban and Regional Systems in 2008. The Centre is now an administrative unit in [[The Bartlett]] School which is the Faculty of the Built Environment.

== Research areas ==

CASA researches the science of cities, working with city governments and related research groups on simulating and visualising urban problems. Their work on transport and movement has included [[Transport for London]]’s [[Oyster card]] data,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21558604 London’s Tube and big data: Underground movement] ''The Economist'' 14 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; public bikes schemes such as the [[Santander Cycles|London's cycle hire scheme]],&lt;ref&gt;Hussey, Matt, [https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/04/start/bike-routes-for-a-city-with-no-tube Boris-bike routes for a city with no Tube], ''Wired Magazine'' 2 March 2011 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103122059/http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/04/start/bike-routes-for-a-city-with-no-tube |date=3 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; population segregation in large cities&lt;ref&gt;Pickford, James and Giles, Chris (2012), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/c83d643a-d4a3-11e1-bb88-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2HUmWjQnM London: The world in a city], ''Financial Times'', 23 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; as well as climate change in the London region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planningresource.co.uk/article/913745/centre-extends-science-planning Centre extends science of planning], ''Planning Resource'', 19 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
The centre is active in exploring how the [[Internet of Things]] can be deployed in large urban areas linking objects in the built environment through internet technologies,&lt;ref&gt;Cookson, Clive (2011) [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/693a21d6-dedf-11e0-9130-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1Y0mtNtZF ’Internet of things’ is set to come], ''Financial Times'', 14 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and was active with the [[Technology Strategy Board]]’s Future Cities [[Catapult centres|Catapult]] in pioneering new software systems for smart cities such as dashboards and portals.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Will (2012) [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/will-deans-ideas-factory-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-your-city-7729082.html Will Dean's Ideas Factory: Everything you wanted to know about your city], ''The Independent'', 10 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Its research programme in city science concentrates on applying social physics to urban systems based on modelling the diffusion of behaviours such as the [[2011 England riots|2011 London riots]]&lt;ref&gt;Geere, Duncan (2012) [https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-04/20/earlier-response-shorten-london-riots Model suggests earlier response could have shortened London riots], ''Wired Magazine'', 20 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and it is heavily involved in using methods of scaling and [[allometry]] to examine city performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21557313 The laws of the city], ''The Economist'', 21 June 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research programme ==

CASA’s research programme is primarily funded by research grants from the [[RCUK|British research councils]], mainly [[ESRC]] and [[EPSRC]]. Since 2008, the centre has been increasingly funded by EU research grants from the 7th Framework and from the [[European Research Council]] (ERC) and in 2014, it was awarded funding from the [[Technology Strategy Board]]'s Future Cities Catapult &lt;ref&gt;[https://futurecities.catapult.org.uk "Future Cities Catapult"]&lt;/ref&gt; to provide demonstration capabilities for urban and regional modelling.

CASA has graduated some 41 PhDs since 2000. Several alumni have made important contributions to the science of cities working in geographic information systems, spatial analysis and urban modelling at UC Berkeley, Maryland, George Mason, UCL, KRISH, LSE, TU-Istanbul, KCL, 
Cardiff, Tehran, Manchester, OU, ETH-Zurich, Kingston, Malta, Warwick, Birkbeck, and Liverpool. [[OpenStreetMap]] (OSM) originated in UCL CASA and The Bartlett, and the firms GeoFutures&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geofutures.com/ "GeoFutures"]&lt;/ref&gt; and Intelligent Space (acquired by [[Atkins (company)|Atkins]]) were associated with the centre. The company Prospective Labs spun-off from CASA in 2016 and is engaged on developing new software systems for planning and land management.

== Contributions ==

Members of CASA have pioneered the development of urban and regional modelling through a series of books that go back to the 1970s. Their work is published in a series of web sites on the CASA Blog Aggregator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blogs.casa.ucl.ac.uk/ "The CASA Blog Aggregator"]&lt;/ref&gt; Key works that reflect CASA’s research programme are ''Fractal Cities'' (1994),&lt;ref&gt;Michael Batty &amp; Paul Longley (1994) [http://www.fractalcities.org/ ''Fractal Cities: A Geometry of Form and Function''] (Academic Press, San Diego, CA and London)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cities and Complexity'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;Michael Batty (2005) [http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cities-and-complexity ''Cities and Complexity: Understanding Cities with Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Models, and Fractals''] (MIT Press, Cambridge MA and London)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Science of Cities and Regions'' (2012),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/earth+sciences+and+geography/geography/book/978-94-007-2265-1 ''The Science of Cities and Regions''] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Agent Based Model of Geographical Systems'' (2012),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/social+sciences/population+studies/book/978-90-481-8926-7 ''Agent Based Model of Geographical Systems''] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The New Science of Cities'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/new-science-cities ''The New Science of Cities''] (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The journals ''[[Environment and Planning|Environment and Planning B]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envplan.com/B.html ''Environment and Planning B'']&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Batty, and ''Future Internet'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/journal/futureinternet ''Future Internet'']&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Hudson-Smith, are run from CASA. The major research focus of CASA is in blending the visualisation of complex urban systems with their simulation.
