==Synopsis==
==="Extra"===

Granny Lin, a fifty-one-year-old spinster, struggles to find work after she is "honorably retired" from a [[Beijing]] garment factory and is denied a pension. Her colleague Auntie Wang recommends that she get married so she can be financially secure with an inheritance. She reluctantly agrees to be matched with Old Tang, a seventy-six year old widower struggling with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Once she is married to him, she has to pretend that Old Tang's previous wife is still alive but ill at the hospital. One day, while they are bathing, Old Tang insists that his previous wife is still alive and, in a fit of passion, tussles with Granny Lin; during their scuffle, he slips and subsequently dies.

After the funeral, in which she refuses to accept any inheritance out go guilt, one of Old Tang's sons recommends her for a job as a maid at the Mei-Mei Academy, a primary boarding school in the mountainous western suburb of Beijing. There, she develops a bond with Kang, a newly-arrived, six-year-old student. She learns that his father is a wealthy agricultural entrepreneur, but Kang is sent away because he is the child the first, now-divorced wife of the tycoon. Because no one comes for him on the weekends, he and Granny Lin bond with each other at the school, taking walks and telling stories during this time until the school week resumes.

Months into her employment, complaints of missing girls' sock arise; Granny Lin knows that Kang is the thief but does not report him. Instead, she goes on a search for them, finding them in him pillowcase. Instead of returning them, she leaves them alone and goes to the city to buy similar socks and mixes them back into the girls' laundry. When Kang's roommate tries to play a prank of him in the middle of the night, he notices Kang stroking his cheeks with his hands gloved with the socks; this results in the entire school alienating Kang. One weekend, Kang decides to hide indefinitely, causing a scare and Granny Lin involves the authorities. Shortly after Kang reveals himself, Granny Lin is dismissed. While walking through the city, a thief snatches her duffel bag and runs off; however, she has lost little, as she has placed he severance pay and extra girls' socks in her lunch pail.

==="After a Life"===

Mr. and Mrs. Su, elderly, married first-cousins who live together in [[Beijing]], take care of their twenty-eight year old daughter Beibei who has [[mental retardation]] and [[cerebral palsy]]. While having breakfast, they receive a call from Mrs. Fong, who suspects that her husband is having an affair; Mrs. Su assures her that Mr. Fong is having breakfast with Mr. Su and he leaves to go to the [[Brokerage firm|stockbrokerage]].

A year prior, Mr. Su and Mr. Fong met each other while trading. A month after their meeting, Mr. Fong confessed that he was seeing a woman in her forties while Mrs. Fong was in prison for [[money laundering]]. After Mr. Fong is comforted, he loans Mr. Su some money indefinitely for investing.

Mrs. Fong, who was released early due to deteriorating health, calls again to tell Mrs. Su that she will hire a detective to find out if Mr. Fong is seeing another woman. Initially, Mrs. Su worries about Mr. Su getting caught between the crossfires of implication, but then Beibei takes her attention away from Mrs. Fong. As she cares for Beibei, she is struck with nostalgia. The Sus fell in love when they were young and had gone against everyone when they married and had Beibei. Ten years later, they tried to normalized their lives by having another child, Jian, who was born without complications.

While working at the stockbrokerage, Mr. Su ruminates about how he tried to test fate by having Beibei. Jian was supposed to bring them closer, but their happiness declined even more. After finishing his work at the firm that day, he find a drunk Mr. Fong; Mr. Su decides to bring his woozy friend to his house. Meanwhile, after having given Beibei sleep medicine, Mrs. Su receives another call; Mrs. Fong tells of how Mr. Fong confessed to her and recommended that the paramour live with them as a second wife to which Mrs. Fong responded with outrage. After Mr. Su helps Mr. Fong fall asleep on the couch and Mrs. Su starts to ignore Mrs. Fong, the Sus head to Beibei's room to examine her; Mrs. Su holds her hand as Mr. Su strokes her hair.

For generations, a small village has consistently produced [[eunuch|Great Papas]] for the imperial families of [[Dynastic China]]. When imperial rule ends and the [[Communist-controlled China (1927–49)|Communist party]] takes control of the nation, the village falls out of favor with the ruling power and loses its reputation.

During a nationwide famine, a boy tries to steal a sparrow for his sick mother; one of the villager castigates him for this. When the others realizes that the boy bares the face of [[Mao Zedong|the dictator]], they let him take as many birds as he wants. During his upbringing, the villagers pay keen attention to keeping him out of harm's way, fearing injury to him will cause them bad luck; however, they also refuse to interact with him, especially keen to keeping their daughters away from him. After the dictator's death, the community goes into a state of mourning, not hearing from the boy (who is now a young man) for years.

One day, when he is in his late twenties, he leaves the village via car for the capital. After many auditions followed by trials, the young man is selected as the dictator's impersonator, starring in films and becoming a recognizable celebrity. When the young man is in his forties and western influences enter the nation's conscience, he begins to doubt his role. Prior, he was a virgin who saw himself too "great" for a woman's body; after reading a biography of the dictator, he begins to incessantly crave sex. As a result, he attempts to secretly fulfill his desires with a prostitute; however, the pimp sets-up the young man, taking embarrassing photographs of him and threatening to release it to the public unless he pays a king's ransom. The young man refuses, and after the photographs' release, he is disgracefully discharged by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|party]].

When the young man returns to the village, he ignores all the greetings from the villagers and heads straight for his mother's grave. There, he "[[Castration|cleans]]" himself, but survives the bleeding and subsequently lives the rest of his life in the village.

After Yang is expelled from the [[Peking Opera School|Peking Opera]] for his homosexuality, he starts working as a prostitute. Boshen pays for Yang's services and eventually they start a relationship, despite there being a huge age gap. One night at a party, Yang meets Sasha and they become acquainted.

Boshen insist that Sasha contact Yang once more before going through with the abortion to see if he want to join her in the states. She reveals that she had tried but Yang was reluctant.

Sansan and Tu get better acquainted because they are the only two students in their collective friends circle that do not demonstrate; eventually, they become engaged. After the crackdown by the government, only students with relatives in the [[United States]] can study abroad there. Sansan, feeling pity for the government backlash against Min, tells Tu (who supposedly has an uncle living in the states) to marry Min and takes her with him during his graduate studies in [[Pennsylvania]], with the promise to divorce Min and return to Beijing after Min is sponsored in the states. Even though Tu suggests that he and Sansan have sex before his departure, she refuses, citing a passage from ''[[Women in Love]]'' about how doing so will make him crave other women more. Despite their promise, Tu falls in love with Min and does not return. 

Ten years later, Sansan becomes an English teacher in Beijing and regularly shows ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' to her students. One day, her mother shows up at the school to inform her that Tu has recently divorced  Min and wants to marry Sansan. Later that day, after ruminating on the past, Sansan goes to confront her mother in the marketplace, who works there as an egg vendor. They argue about Tu's proposal and Sansan ultimately tells her mother that she is no long interested in Tu. Her mother responds by citing that since she is no longer a virgin, no man wants to marry her, reiterating the town's belief that she and Tu did have sex before he left. Some time later, a  uncouthly-dressed man enters the marketplace with a sign reading: "Give me ten [[Yuan (currency)|yuan]] and I will let you slice me once wherever you like; if you finish my life with one cut, you owe me nothing." A crowd gathers around him. Sansan's mother, thinking the man a beggar, gives the man ten yuan and he holds a knife to her; she refuses to touch it.  He subsequently returns the money. Sansan takes the money, gives it to the man, takes the knife, and slashes him on the shoulder, finally finding someone she "loves."

She offers the children money to accompany her to church, but Han counters by offering double the amount if they do not go inside. The children take Han's offer, leave, and his mother goes inside. While Han waits, he notices an automobile accident in the periphery but does not go to look, fearing it could involve the children he gave money to before.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4921">The '''Architectural Barriers Act of 1968''' ("'''ABA'''", {{USStatute|90|480|82|718|1968|08|12}}, codified at {{usc|42|4151}} et seq.) is an [[Act of Congress]], enacted by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

The ABA requires that facilities designed, built, altered, or leased with funds supplied by the [[United States Federal Government]] be accessible to the public.&lt;ref name=About&gt;[http://www.access-board.gov/about/aboutABA/brochure.htm About the Architectural Barriers Act and Other Disability Rights Laws] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712032100/http://www.access-board.gov/about/aboutABA/brochure.htm |date=July 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, it mandates provision of disabled-access toilet facilities in such buildings. &lt;ref name="Anthony"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anthony |first=Kathryn H. and |author2=Meghan Dufresne |year=2007|title=Potty Parity in Perspective: Gender and Family Issues in Planning and Designing Public Restrooms |journal=Journal of Planning Literature |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=267–294 |doi=10.1177/0885412206295846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ABA marks one of the first efforts to ensure that certain federally funded buildings and facilities are designed and constructed to be accessible to people with disabilities. Facilities that predate the law generally are not covered, but alterations or leases undertaken after the law took effect can trigger coverage.

Uniform standards for the design, construction and alteration of buildings so that persons with disabilities will have ready access to and use of them. These [http://www.access-board.gov/ufas/ufas-html/ufas.htm#ABA Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards] (UFAS) are developed and maintained by an Access Board and serve as the basis for the standards used to enforce the law. The Board enforces the ABA by investigating complaints concerning particular facilities. Four Federal agencies are responsible for the setting the standards: the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]], the [[General Services Administration]], and the [[U.S. Postal Service]]. These federal agencies are responsible for ensuring compliance with UFAS when funding the design, construction, alteration, or leasing of facilities. Some departments have, as a matter of policy, also required compliance with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] accessibility guidelines (which otherwise do not apply to the Federal sector) in addition to UFAS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access-board.gov/about/laws/ABA.htm The Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) of 1968:Introduction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714124626/http://www.access-board.gov/about/laws/ABA.htm |date=July 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The ABA (as amended) consists of seven sections:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access-board.gov/ufas/ufas-html/ufas.htm#ABA |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712032218/http://www.access-board.gov/ufas/ufas-html/ufas.htm |archivedate=2007-07-12 |df= }} The Architectural Barriers Act - as amended through 1984&lt;/ref&gt;
*Section 1 defines the buildings or facilities covered by the Act.
*Section 2, 3, 4 and 4a describe the role of each standards-setting agency. 
**The General Services Administration (GSA) prescribes standards for all buildings subject to the Architectural Barriers Act that are not covered by standards issued by the other three standard-setting agencies;
**The Department of Defense (DoD) prescribes standards for DoD installations; 
**The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) prescribes standards for residential structures covered by the Architectural Barriers Act except those funded or constructed by DoD;
**The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) prescribes standards for postal facilities. 
*Section 5 states that buildings designed, constructed, or altered ''after'' the effective date (August 12, 1968) are covered under the Act.
*Section 6 concerns modification of standards and the granting of waivers.
*Section 7a requires that the Administrator of General Services report to [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] on his or her activities as they pertain to the act.
*Section 7b amends the Act to ensure compliance with the standards, by the establishment an independent Federal agency, the [[Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board]] established by section 502 of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]]. 7b also requires report of the Compliance Board to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] "activities and actions to insure compliance with the standards prescribed under this Act."

'''''Aval Appadithan''''' ({{lang-en|That is how she is|italic=yes}}) is a 1978 Indian [[Tamil language|Tamil-language]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[C. Rudhraiya]] in his directorial debut, and co-written by him with [[K. Rajeshwar|Somasundareshwar]]. The film was produced by Ragamanjari in association with the [[M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute]]. It stars [[Kamal Haasan]], [[Rajinikanth]], and [[Sripriya]], while [[Ilaiyaraaja]] composed the film's music. The plot revolves around Manju (Sripriya) and the difficulties she faces in her life, due to her romantic relationships, resulting in her developing an aggressive and cynical nature towards men.

''Aval Appadithan'' was released on 30 October 1978, on [[Diwali]] day. Although the film received positive critical reception, it was not a box office success at the time of its release. However, the film began to develop an audience after directors [[P. Bharathiraja]] and [[Mrinal Sen]] commented positively about it. The film was noted for its stylish filmmaking, screenplay, and dialogue, a large portion of it being in English.

''Aval Appadithan'' was the first film made by a graduate of the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute, facilitating students of film technology to achieve success in the field of cinema. The film received the second prize for [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]] at the 1978 [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]], while Nallusamy and M. N. Gnanashekharan won the [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Cinematographer|Best Cinematographer]] award. Additionally, Sripriya received a [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize|Special Award]] for the Best Actress of 1978. In 2013, [[CNN-News18]] included the film in its list, "The 100 greatest Indian films of all time".

== Plot ==
Manju ([[Sripriya]]) was raised in a [[dysfunctional family]] that consisted of a timid father and a philandering mother; she hurtles from one disastrous affair to another, leading to her degenerating into a cynical woman. Into her life enter two radically different men. One of them is her boss, Thyagu ([[Rajinikanth]]), who owns the advertising agency she works for. He is a stereotype of the successful man: money-minded, opinionated, arrogant, and a male chauvinist. In sharp contrast is Arun ([[Kamal Haasan]]), who has come to [[Chennai]] from [[Coimbatore]] to make a documentary on women. Sensitive and sincere, he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at the cynical attitudes of Manju and Thyagu.

Manju has been drafted by Thyagu to assist Arun in his documentary. As Arun and Manju start working together, Arun begins to understand Manju's complex personality. She tells Arun about her unfortunate past relationships: How she was molested by her uncle, the ending of her first relationship in college when her lover left her by marrying another woman for the sake of employment, and how her second love, Mano (Sivachandran), a [[Christianity|Christian]] priest's son, used her to satisfy his needs and lust, calling her "sister" in front of her parents. These incidents have led to her present attitude towards men. Arun later shares these conversations with Thyagu, who warns him to steer clear of such women.

Inevitably, Arun falls for Manju. However Manju incurs Thyagu's wrath when he overhears her reprimanding her office staff for commenting on her character. When Thyagu also comments about her, she resigns from her job. When he learns of this, Arun requests Thyagu to re-employ her. Thyagu simply laughs and says that she is already back, after which Manju seems to have a change of heart and starts courting Thyagu. Arun is devastated to see that she has turned out to be just the sort of woman that Thyagu earlier said she was {{mdash}} opportunistic, money-minded, and fickle. When he asks her about her contradicting stands in life, she responds by saying that is the way she is and will be.

The truth finally emerges that Manju was merely baiting Thyagu to teach him a lesson. When Thyagu starts believing that Manju has fallen for him, he attempts to take advantage of her at a party banquet, but she rebukes and slaps him, after which Thyagu runs away in fright. However, this revelation comes too late for her, as Arun, who is disillusioned with her behaviour, has already married a small town girl ([[Saritha]]). When Manju tells her aunt about the attempt to humiliate Thyagu and its ramifications, her aunt tells Manju that she deserved it for leaving behind a golden opportunity to start a new life. In a final discussion in Thyagu's car, Manju asks Arun's wife, "What do you think of women's liberation?". Arun's wife replies, "I don't know". Manju replies with a cynical, "that is why you are happy". The film ends with Manju standing on the road as the car carrying Thyagu and the married couple pulls away from her. A voice-over says, "She died today. She will be reborn tomorrow. She will die again. She will be reborn again. That is how she is".

=== Development ===
C. Rudhraiya, whose former name was Aarumugam, was introduced to Kamal Haasan by writer and director Ananthu. The three shared an interest in the works of [[Robert Bresson]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Roman Polanski]], and [[Roberto Rossellini]]. Godard and Bresson were part of the [[French New Wave]], which focused on films based on social ideas, some of which were [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] in nature.&lt;ref name="Kolappan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rudhraiyah-was-inspired-by-french-new-wave-films/article6616759.ece |title=Rudhraiyah was inspired by French New Wave films |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=20 November 2014 |accessdate=29 November 2014 |author=Kolappan, B. |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6US1EzMgk?url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rudhraiyah-was-inspired-by-french-new-wave-films/article6616759.ece |archivedate=29 November 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudhraiya, Haasan, and Ananthu wanted to experiment with their ideas in Tamil.

== Themes and influences ==
''Aval Appadithan'' explores a number of themes such as women's liberation, sex and the chauvinistic attitude of males.&lt;ref name=RudhraiyaDead/&gt; Its central theme is on women and their plight in society, as exemplified by Manju and her relationships. Born to a timid father and a mother with loose moral values, she is also subsequently affected by two people she becomes romantically involved with. One, her college mate, left her to marry someone else for the sake of a job; and the second is Mano, the son of a Christian priest, who used her to satisfy his lust and then trivialised their relationship by calling her "sister" in front of her parents. These relationships result in her becoming wary of men and developing an aggressive nature towards them.{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page = 18}} Conversations related to matters like the status of women in contemporary (1978) times and the nature of humankind are frequently seen in the film.{{Sfn|Ramachandran|2014|page = 85}}

Sociologist Selvaraj Velayutham says in his book, ''Tamil Cinema: The Cultural Politics of India's Other Film Industry'', that Manju's characterisation was "brought out entirely verbally by her". Velayutham believes the film to be constantly resorting to "existing myths about women and relationships: that a wayward mother destroys her children; that a woman who speaks the 'truth' is always alone; that men are scared of her; that the woman who is different is confused, not sure of herself and is only seeking love from a man but does not know it herself." Velayutham further asserts that the film's only positive aspect is "it does not expose the body of women in the way it is customary" and that Manju could have avoided her unfortunate set of circumstances "if only she had a 'proper' mother!"{{Sfn|Velayutham|2008|page = 25}}

Artist [[Jeeva (artist)|V. Jeevananthan]] compared ''Aval Appadithan'' to other films whose central theme was women, such as ''[[Charulata]]'' (1964), ''[[Aval Oru Thodar Kathai]]'' (1974), and ''[[Panchagni]]'' (1986), while also labelling them as "classics that put the spotlight on women."&lt;ref name="Substance"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/women-of-substance/article1522854.ece | title=Women of substance | work=The Hindu | date=9 March 2011 | accessdate=1 December 2014 | author=Jeshi, K. | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201104938/http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/women-of-substance/article1522854.ece | archivedate=1 December 2014 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, in their book ''Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema'', say the film was also inspired by the 1972 film, ''Dhakam'', which starred [[R. Muthuraman]] and [[Pandari Bai]].{{sfn|Rajadhyaksha|Willemen|1998|p=413}} They also note that ''Aval Appadithan'' uses a "fluid narrative style" and music to mix flashbacks with vox-pop and "glossy pictorialism".{{sfn|Rajadhyaksha|Willemen|1998|p=435}} The film is an exception on stereotypes of women, as shown by paralleling an independent woman, Manju, and a pious traditional woman: Manju gets into problems while Arun's wife is happy. The last lines of the film where Manju asks "what do you think of 'women's liberation'",  Arun's wife answers, "I don't know",  to which Manju says "that is why you are happy", send the message that one will inevitably get into trouble if one exhibits assertive behaviour.&lt;ref name="Substance" /&gt;

Kamal Haasan's character, Arun, is an early version of a [[metrosexual]] male {{mdash}} sensitive and sincere. Rajinikanth's character, Thyagu, is the exact opposite of Arun {{mdash}} money-minded, arrogant, and a womaniser. This is evident when Thyagu says to Arun: "Women should be enjoyed, not analysed."{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page = 18}} According to Rajinikanth, Thyagu was very much similar to him in real life&amp;nbsp;— he too smokes and drinks, but applies ''[[vibhuti]]'' (sacred ash) on his forehead. This implies that Thyagu was also an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Rajini-may-lose-his-appeal-if-he-declares-his-political-affiliation/articleshow/50756685.cms |title=Rajini may lose his appeal if he declares his political affiliation |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=28 January 2016 |accessdate=21 March 2016 |last=Kalyanaraman |first=M |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gAk3mLk7?url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Rajini-may-lose-his-appeal-if-he-declares-his-political-affiliation/articleshow/50756685.cms |archivedate=21 March 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to film critic [[Naman Ramachandran]], Thyagu was, by far, Rajinikanth's most entertaining character up to that point in his career; his character was a self-confessed chauvinist who believed that men and women can never be equal, and that women are merely objects to be used for men's pleasure. When Arun calls Thyagu "a prejudiced ass", Thyagu responds by saying, "I am a male ass," with the dialogue being in English. His opinion of Sripriya's character, Manju, is seen when he says (also in English), "She is a self pitying sex-starved bitch!"{{Sfn|Ramachandran|2014|page = 85}}

After the recording session of "Ninaivo Oru Paravai" from the film, ''[[Sigappu Rojakkal]]'' (1978), Ilaiyaraaja asked Haasan to record "Panneer Pushpangale" that same afternoon.

The soundtrack received positive reviews from critics. B. Kolappan of ''[[The Hindu]]'' wrote, "If the song "Uravugal Thodarkathai" poignantly captures the vulnerable moments in the life of a woman, "Panneer Pushpangale" and "Vaazhkai Odam Chella" in ''Aval Appadithan'' are known for their melody and philosophical touch."&lt;ref name="Kolappan" /&gt; According to Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai, author of the article ''The 1970s Tamil cinema and the post-classical turn'', Ilaiyaraaja's songs were used "to punctuate the interiority of the characters rather than as a spectacle or as a device to move the plot forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.cla.temple.edu/chat/india/documents/Pillai.pdf | title=The 1970s Tamil cinema and the post-classical turn | publisher=[[Michigan State University]] | date=April 2012 | last=Pillai | first=Swarnavel Eswaran | journal=[[Routledge]] | volume=10 | pages=77–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical response ===
The film received generally positive reviews from critics.&lt;ref name = "Aval"/&gt; On 19 November 1978, the magazine ''[[Ananda Vikatan]]'' criticised the gaps in the film, particularly the abundance of English dialogue, the excessive focus on naturalism, and lower standard of technical work (especially the cinematography). Despite these perceived flaws, the magazine still appreciated the film, stating that the actors immersed themselves into their characters, leading to them not really acting before the camera but living the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title=சினிமா விமர்சனம்: அவள் அப்படிதான் |trans-title=Movie Review: Aval Appadithan | work=[[Ananda Vikatan]] | date=19 November 1978 | language=Tamil}}&lt;/ref&gt; K. Balamurugan of [[Rediff.com|Rediff]] said, "It was what we would call parallel cinema these days."&lt;ref name = "Top 10"/&gt;

Writing for ''The Hindu'', [[Baradwaj Rangan]] said, "''Aval Appadithan'' was different. The shadowy black-and-white cinematography was different. The dialogues, which were more about revealing character than advancing plot, were different. The frank handling of sex and profanity ('she is a self-pitying, sex-starved bitch!') was different.

=== Box office ===
The film did not initially receive a big response from the public, and was not a box office success upon its release. However, after the directors [[P.

It slipped through their fingers, so to speak. With all the attention that films get these days, I doubt we can get away with such a film any more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/look-back-at-kamal/article6555452.ece | title=Look back at Kamal | work=The Hindu | date=1 November 2014 | accessdate=1 December 2014 | author=Srinivasan, Sudhir | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201045444/http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/look-back-at-kamal/article6555452.ece | archivedate=1 December 2014 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Carmen Boullosa was born on September 4, 1954 in Mexico City, Mexico.&lt;ref name="congressbio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carmen Boullosa (Mexico) (1954-)|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/n91068055/carmen-boullosa-mexico-1954/|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=February 5, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206104356/https://www.loc.gov/item/n91068055/carmen-boullosa-mexico-1954/|archivedate=February 6, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Boullosa has published eighteen novels.&lt;ref name="congressbio"/&gt; Though all different from one another, on theme and form, Boullosa´s style has s distinctive personality.

One of her novels, ''Son vacas, somos puercos'' (1991, translated into English in 1997 as ''They're Cows, We're Pigs''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/18/books/new-noteworthy-paperbacks-307823.html|title=New &amp; Noteworthy Paperbacks|first=Scott|last=Veale|date=18 March 2001|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213011045/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/18/books/new-noteworthy-paperbacks-307823.html|archivedate=13 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is narrated in the first person by an old man looking back on his life.  He was kidnapped and sent from his native France on a slave ship to the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] at the age of thirteen.  To gain his freedom, he joins a group of pirates (or "pigs"), allowing Boullosa to compare two very different societal and political systems&amp;mdash;traditional Europe and carefree pirates.  In ''La milagrosa'', a novel written in 1993, the protagonist is a girl who has the power to heal the sick and perform other miracles while she sleeps. She falls in love with Aurelio Jimenez, a detective sent to discredit her, even though she fears that her powers will disappear if she spends time with people.  It ends ambiguously, leaving an unsolved murder without closure.  ''Duerme'', another popular work published in 1995, tells the story of Claire, a French woman whose mother was a prostitute. Attempting to escape the same profession, she arrives in Spain dressed as a man.  To save a subject of the Spanish king, she reveals herself as a female and prepares to take his punishment of death by hanging.  Beforehand, however, she is wounded in the left breast and her blood is replaced by water from the lakes of Mexico City.  The water's magical powers make it possible for her to survive the punishment.

Boullosa is also well known for her ''Teatro herético'' (1987), a compilation of three parodies in play format&amp;mdash;''Aura y las once mil vírgenes'', ''Cocinar hombres'', and ''Propusieron a María''.  The first tells the story of a man called by God to "deflower" eleven thousand virgins in his life, so that heaven's overpopulation problem might be addressed, since the women will have to wait in purgatory for a time. The man then uses his sexual encounters as material for his television commercials and becomes a successful advertising agent. ''Cocinar hombres'' tells the story of two girls who find themselves to have become young adult witches overnight, so as to fly over the earth tempting but not satisfying men.  Finally, the third play satirically recounts the conversation between [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] and [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] before Mary gives birth to [[Jesus]] and ascends to heaven.

==Personal life==
Boullosa has two children—[[María Aura]] and Juan Aura—with her former partner, [[Alejandro Aura]]—and is now married to author [[Mike Wallace (historian)|Mike Wallace]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6845">'''Computerized Approach to Residential Land Analysis''', known as '''CARLA''', was a proprietary software program developed by the architectural firm Willis &amp; Associates of [[San Francisco]], [[California]], in 1971.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:CARLA brochure 01.tif|thumb|right|CARLA Brochure]]
[[File:CARLA brochure 02.tif|thumb|right|CARLA Brochure]]
In the 1970s, there were not many architectural and engineering firms that recognized the computer’s potential as a tool for financial evaluation. [[Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills]], a firm in [[Jacksonville]], [[Florida]], produced managing [[software]] designed to organize an array of financials that could help identify a successful development investment strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Economic Probes, Key to Developer’s Success, enhanced by Computers from Building Design and Construction|journal=The Magazine of Commercial and Industrial Building|date=June 1972|publisher=A Cahner’s Publication}}&lt;/ref&gt; This application was limited to financial analysis and marked the first phase of computer application in [[architecture]]. In 1971, Willis and Associates innovated the computer’s spatial analysis capacities for application in architectural and [[land-use planning|land planning]] practices, foreshadowing the eventual development of [[computer-aided design]] and mapping programs in architecture and urban planning. CARLA was able to produce in a twenty-day period what by traditional methods and analyses would achieve in four to six months, allowing land development and construction to take place more rapidly. This was an important consideration in the 1970s when rates of inflation were rising and construction delays could introduce significant cost increases.  CARLA could process “500% more information in 400% less time and at 40% of the cost generated by utilizing the more traditional methods.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff Writer|title=Computer Moves into Land Studies|publisher=S.F., Sunday Examiner &amp; Chronicle|date=September 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software Development==
[[File:058 CARLA computer room.jpg|thumb|left|CARLA Computer Room]]
CARLA was a customized software program conceived by [[Beverly Willis]] and written in house by a [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] student, Jochen Eigen, designed to analyze prospective land parcels for their development potential as large-scale multi-unit complexes. Jochen Eigen wrote the programming scripts that directed CARLA as the managing software to interface a variety of planning unit concepts with a mapping program that could then process a variety of planning proposals against the site’s fixed fields of relevant data. The data was extracted from traditional analog topographical maps soil analysis, and marketing information.

Once the physical characteristics were entered into CARLA, the computer could generate contour perspectives of the site from any point plotted along an x, y, x axis and help identify areas of common building suitability, natural drainage patterns slope analysis and areas requiring cut and fill. Using the CARLA grid as a structural template, multiple planning unit concepts were introduced and profiled against the site’s fixed characteristics and CARLA would then determine what plan, how many building units and of what variety could be successfully integrated into designated areas within the site.  These tests were repeated until a match that produced environmentally and economically sound results was identified.

The computer graphic information reports were represented either in the form of topographical site perspectives, contour maps or as a sequence of numeric values organized within a template matrix that allowed the architect to identify the optimal relationships and planning concept. This work then became the basis for presentation materials that were used to introduce the client/developer to the proposed designs.

==Selected Projects==

===IRS Computer Center Building (unbuilt)===
In 1976, Willis &amp; Associates was awarded a federal building commission from the General Services Administration (GSA) in [[Washington, D.C.]], representing the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), and administered by the GSA office in [[Kansas City]], [[Missouri]].  The project was conceived by the IRS as a prototype design that would be site-adapted for nine subsequent buildings in IRS regions across the country.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casey|first1=John|title=Beverly Willis Oral History Project|url=http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/ROHO/projects/beverlywillis/|website=The Bancroft Library|publisher=Regional Oral History Office|accessdate=11 October 2015|location=University of California, Berkeley|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Computer Center Building was part of an $800 million dollar program to automate tax returns at tax processing campuses servicing different IRS regions nationwide. Willis &amp; Associates’ program CARLA provided the technical knowledge required for the IRS Computer Center Building.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Aliamanu Valley Community for Military Family Housing (1978)===

In 1974, Willis &amp; Associates, Inc., was awarded an architectural and engineering contract for the design and plan of the Aliamanu Valley Community for Military Housing in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. The project was a $110 million complex of 11,500 inhabitants, residing in 525 buildings on a 524-acre site. It was the first joint family housing venture in Hawaii.  The community consisted of an Army-Navy complex of 2,600 family apartments: 1,600 Army apartments, 800 Navy apartments, and 200 for the Marine Corps.

Though CARLA had been previously used in designing multi-housing complexes on challenging sites, the Aliamanu site presented a greater challenge due to a non-active volcanic crater floor in a one hundred year old flood plain of clay.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrath|first1=David J.|title=A-E Computerized Path to Large-Scale Housing|journal=Engineering News Record|date=November 1976|pages=Cover Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fundamental to the development of an economical land-use plan for Aliamanu was the firm’s belief that the “best site plans are those that least disturb the land, that preserve the natural drainage channels and minimize need to cut and fill.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Land planning decisions were based on the principle−Less construction means less destruction. CARLA’s analyses allowed for less earth-moving for the project, causing less destruction to the environment and lowering overall construction costs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3894">'''Dan Kwian''' ({{lang-th|ด่านเกวียน}}) is a village and [[tambon|subdistrict]] in [[Chok Chai District]], [[Nakhon Ratchasima Province]]. It is known for its [[pottery]] and [[handicrafts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cummings|first=Joe|title=Thailand|year=2001|publisher=Lonely Planet Publications|isbn=1 86450 251 7|pages=580}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The village name Dan Kwian means toll station or check point (''Dan'') for oxcarts (''Kwian'').

==Location==
Dan Kwian sits at a [[narrows]] of the [[Mun River|Mun]] (Thai: แม่น้ำมูล) river and was a convenient [[Ford (river)|river crossing]] point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Louis|title=Traditional Thai Pottery Guide and Dictionary|year=1991|publisher=Louis Katz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river provided the means for distributing utilitarian pottery produced in Dan Kwian to a wide market. The village, located on the road connecting [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] and [[Chok Chai]], is broken into two distinct parts. Dan Kwian Din Phao (ด่านเกวียนดินเผา), a congregation of larger [[Factory|factories]] and a roadside sales area for ceramics, both local and sourced from other centers in Thailand, is located about 2 kilometers north of the historic village Moo Baan Dan Kwian (หมู่บ้านด่านเกวียน). The Tambon covers a 10.17 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area. The people of Dan Kwian are mostly employed in handicrafts and farming.

==History==
Pottery production is said to have started around 1740, although this date has not been verified. The same account states that pottery production began with [[Mon people|Mon]] (Thai: มอญ) refugees similar to the potters of [[Ko Kred]] (Kred Island). This claim, although popularly held, may not be accurate.&lt;ref name=Chiminok&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiminok|first=Nikom|title=Dankwean|year=2000|publisher=Publisher Unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to approximately 1972 nearly all the products of Dan Kwian kilns were functional vessels. Common forms were water storage [[jar]]s of around 50 liters capacity, lidded jars for preparing fermented fish, [[mortar and pestle|mortars]], and [[Sink|basins]]. There is no evidence of [[tableware]] production at Dan Kwian.&lt;ref name=Chiminok/&gt; Most of the pottery is fired in above-ground [[Anagama kiln|anagama]]-style wood [[kiln]]s, although at least one [[Anagama kiln#Kiln variants|noborigama]] chamber kiln, many gas kilns, and at least one electric kiln have been used in recent years. Ceramic ware in Dan Kwian was traditionally fired in two distinct styles, Phao Dam (Thai:เผาดำ), or "fired black," and Phao Deng (Thai:เผาแดง), "fired red." Phao Dam ware was fired to temperatures between approximately {{convert|1200|°C|°F}} and {{convert|1250|°C|°F}}. The ware at this temperature became dark brown and vitreous. Phao Dam wares were prized for durability and lack of [[porosity]]. Most notable of these products are the once ubiquitous Dan Kwian water jars.

Starting around 1972, decorative ware started to be made in Dan Kwian to serve a new market of urban consumers centered in Bangkok. University-based designers became involved with developing new products for hotels and other public spaces as well as private homes. At first this decorative ware consisted simply of water jars ornamented with carved [[Decorative arts|decoration]]. Gradually the decorative ware expanded to include varied ornamental vessel forms, clay [[tile]], carved [[ceramic]] [[mural]]s, ceramic [[jewellery]], and free-standing [[sculpture]]. Other media are also now produced in Dan Kwian, most notably [[cement]]-based carved [[sandstone]] replicas.&lt;ref name=Chiminok/&gt;

[[File:Free Newfoundland Logo.gif|thumb|right|alt=Logo|The "Free Newfoundland" slogan on a T-Shirt by [http://livingplanet.ca/index.php/about/free-nfld The Living Planet clothing company, St. John's]]]

'''Free Newfoundland''' also written as "Free NFLD" is a [[slogan]] coined by [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] cartoonist Wallace Ryan in 1982. This slogan appeared on posters around [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] during the 1980s to encourage and promote Newfoundland &amp; Labrador nationalism. In the early 1990s, an unnamed artist painted this slogan at the end of George Street in St. John's without the knowledge or permission of Mr. Ryan. Although many in the province debate the meaning of the slogan, Mr. Ryan is quite explicit when it comes to the meaning of the slogan when asked about it. "'Free Newfoundland' is without doubt, a call to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador to seek a different path than that presented to us by Confederation and that path, is independence for the province."

In the mid-1990s, Mr. Ryan licensed the slogan to Living Planet to produce a line of t-shirts with the slogan accompanied by a bright red star above appearing above it. Living Planet has gone on to produce a line of products based on this slogan from mugs to underwear. It is one of the best selling t-shirts in the history of the company.

(NOTE: "NFLD" is the former postal acronym for Newfoundland and Labrador. It was replaced by "NF" and then in recent years, "NL")

Rawls's theory of [[Justice as Fairness|"justice as fairness"]] recommends equal basic rights, equality of opportunity, and promoting the interests of the least advantaged members of society. Rawls's argument for these principles of social justice uses a thought experiment called the "[[original position]]", in which people select what kind of society they would choose to live under if they did not know which social position they would personally occupy. In his later work ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' (1993), Rawls turned to the question of how political power could be made legitimate given reasonable disagreement about the nature of the good life.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Rawls was born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], the second of five sons of William Lee Rawls, "one of the most prominent attorneys in Baltimore",&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; and Anna Abell Stump Rawls.&lt;ref name="Freemanxix"&gt;Freeman, 2010:xix&lt;/ref&gt; Tragedy struck Rawls at a young age: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Two of his brothers died in childhood because they had contracted fatal illnesses from him. ... In 1928, the seven-year-old Rawls contracted [[diphtheria]]. His brother Bobby, younger by 20 months, visited him in his room and was fatally infected. The next winter, Rawls contracted [[pneumonia]]. Another younger brother, Tommy, caught the illness from him and died.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rawls's biographer [[Thomas Pogge]] calls the loss of the brothers the "most important events in John's childhood".&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt;

Rawls attended the [[Calvert School]] in Baltimore for six years, before transferring to the [[Kent School]], an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] in [[Connecticut]]. Upon graduation in 1939, Rawls attended [[Princeton University]] where he graduated ''summa cum laude'' and was accepted into [[The Ivy Club]] and the [[American Whig-Cliosophic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/princetonperiodicals?a=d&amp;d=Princetonian19400412-01.2.3&amp;srpos=2&amp;e=-------en-20--1-byDA-txt-IN-rawls----# |title=Daily Princetonian 12 April 1940 — Princeton Periodicals |publisher=Theprince.princeton.edu |date=1940-04-12 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his last two years at Princeton, he "became deeply concerned with theology and its doctrines." He considered attending a seminary to study for the Episcopal priesthood&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Cohen and Thomas Nagel, [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5931573.ece "John Rawls: On My Religion"], ''Times Literary Supplement'', 18 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote an "intensely religious senior thesis (''BI)''."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At Princeton, Rawls was influenced by [[Norman Malcolm]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s student.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2013/entries/rawls/|title=John Rawls|last=Wenar|first=Leif|date=2013-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1943, and enlisted in the [[United States Army|Army]] in February of that year.&lt;ref name="Freemanxix" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article by [[Iain King]], titled [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-john-rawls.htm Thinker at War: Rawls], published in Military History Monthly, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military service, 1943–46===
During [[World War II]], Rawls served as an [[infantry]]man in the Pacific, where he toured [[New Guinea]] and was awarded a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]];&lt;ref&gt;"His first experience of combat was in New Guinea – a country which saw fighting for almost the whole duration of the Pacific campaign – where he won a Bronze Star."

Later Rawls confided the whole experience was 'particularly terrible' ..."

Following the surrender of Japan, Rawls became part of [[General MacArthur]]'s occupying army&lt;ref name="Freemanxix" /&gt; and was promoted to sergeant.&lt;ref name="Thinker at War: Rawls"&gt;From article by [[Iain King]], titled [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-john-rawls.htm Thinker at War: Rawls], published in Military History Monthly, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  But he became disillusioned with the military when he saw the aftermath of the atomic blast in [[Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;"The total obliteration of physical infrastructure, and the even more horrific human toll, affected him deeply ... and the fact that the destruction had been deliberately inflicted by his own side, was profoundly unsettling. He wrote that the scenes still haunted him 50 years later."

===Academic career===
In early 1946,&lt;ref&gt;Date from [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-john-rawls.htm Thinker at War: Rawls], published in Military History Monthly, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Rawls returned to Princeton to pursue a doctorate in moral philosophy.

He married Margaret Warfield Fox, a [[Brown University]] graduate, in 1949. They had four children, Anne Warfield, Robert Lee, Alexander Emory, and Elizabeth Fox.&lt;ref name="Freemanxix" /&gt;

After earning his PhD from Princeton in 1950, Rawls taught there until 1952 when he received a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] to [[Oxford University]] ([[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]), where he was influenced by the liberal political theorist and historian [[Isaiah Berlin]] and the legal theorist [[H. L. A. Hart]]. After returning to the United States he served first as an assistant and then associate professor at [[Cornell University]]. In 1962 he became a full professor of philosophy at Cornell, and soon achieved a tenured position at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. That same year he moved to [[Harvard University]], where he taught for almost forty years and where he trained some of the leading contemporary figures in moral and political philosophy, including [[Thomas Nagel]], [[Allan Gibbard]], [[Onora O'Neill, Baroness O'Neill of Bengarve|Onora O'Neill]], [[Adrian Piper]], [[Elizabeth S. Anderson]], [[Christine Korsgaard]], [[Susan Neiman]], [[Claudia Card]], [[Thomas Pogge]], [[T. M. Scanlon]], [[Barbara Herman]], [[Joshua Cohen (philosopher)|Joshua Cohen]], [[Thomas E. Hill (academic)|Thomas E. Hill Jr.]], [[Gurcharan Das]], [[Andreas Teuber]], Samuel Freeman and Paul Weithman.

===Later life===
Rawls seldom gave interviews and, having both a stutter (partially born out of the deaths of two of his brothers via infections contracted from himself)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rogers |first1=Ben |title=Obituary: John Rawls |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/nov/27/guardianobituaries.obituaries |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "bat-like horror of the limelight",&lt;ref name="guardian2002"&gt;Rogers, 27.09.02&lt;/ref&gt; did not become a public intellectual despite his fame. He instead remained committed mainly to his academic and family life.&lt;ref name="guardian2002" /&gt;

In 1995 he suffered the first of several strokes, severely impeding his ability to continue to work. He was nevertheless able to complete a book titled ''[[The Law of Peoples]]'', the most complete statement of his views on international justice, and shortly before his death in November 2002 published ''Justice As Fairness: A Restatement'', a response to criticisms of ''A Theory of Justice''.

Rawls died on 24 November 2002 and is buried at the [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Massachusetts. He was survived by his wife, their four children, and four grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2002/12/john-rawls-influential-political-philosopher-dead-at-81-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical thought==
Rawls published three main books. The first, ''A Theory of Justice'', focused on distributive justice and attempted to reconcile the competing claims of the values of freedom and equality. The second, ''Political Liberalism'', addressed the question of how citizens divided by intractable religious and philosophical disagreements could come to endorse a constitutional democratic regime. The third, ''The Law of Peoples'', focused on the issue of global justice.

===''A Theory of Justice''===
Rawls's ''magnum opus'' titled ''A Theory of Justice'', published in 1971, aimed to resolve the seemingly competing claims of freedom and equality. The shape Rawls's resolution took, however, was not that of a balancing act that compromised or weakened the moral claim of one value compared with the other. Rather, his intent was to show that notions of freedom and equality could be integrated into a seamless unity he called ''justice as fairness''. By attempting to enhance the perspective which his readers should take when thinking about justice, Rawls hoped to show the supposed conflict between freedom and equality to be illusory.

Rawls's ''A Theory of Justice'' (1971) includes a thought experiment he called the "[[original position]]". The intuition motivating its employment is this: the enterprise of political philosophy will be greatly benefited by a specification of the correct standpoint a person should take in his or her thinking about justice. When we think about what it would mean for a just state of affairs to obtain between persons, we eliminate certain features (such as hair or eye color, height, race, etc.) and fixate upon others. Rawls's original position is meant to encode all of our intuitions about which features are relevant, and which irrelevant, for the purposes of deliberating well about justice.

The original position is Rawls' [[hypothetical]] scenario in which a group of persons is set the task of reaching an agreement about the kind of political and economic structure they want for a society, which they will then occupy. Each individual, however, deliberates behind a "[[veil of ignorance]]": each lacks knowledge, for example, of his or her gender, race, age, intelligence, wealth, skills, education and religion. The only thing that a given member knows about themselves is that they are in possession of the basic capacities necessary to fully and willfully participate in an enduring system of mutual cooperation; each knows they can be a member of the society.

Rawls posits two basic capacities that the individuals would know themselves to possess.  First, individuals know that they have the capacity to form, pursue, and revise a conception of the good, or life plan.  Exactly what sort of conception of the good this is, however, the individual does not yet know.  It may be, for example, religious or secular, but at the start, the individual in the original position does not know which.  Second, each individual understands him or herself to have the capacity to develop a sense of justice and a generally effective desire to abide by it.  Knowing only these two features of themselves, the group will deliberate in order to design a social structure, during which each person will seek his or her maximal advantage.  The idea is that proposals that we would ordinarily think of as unjust – such as that blacks or women should not be allowed to hold public office – will not be proposed, in this, Rawls' original position, because it would be ''irrational'' to propose them.  The reason is simple: one does not know whether he himself would be a woman or a black person.  This position is expressed in the [[difference principle]], according to which, in a system of ignorance about one's status, one would strive to improve the position of the worst off, because he might find himself in that position.

Rawls develops his original position by modeling it, in certain respects at least, after the "initial situations" of various social contract thinkers who came before him, including [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. (Each social contractarian constructs his/her initial situation somewhat differently, having in mind a unique political morality s/he intends the thought experiment to generate.)&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha; Frontiers of Justice; Harvard U Press; Cambridge, Massachusetts; 2006; Kindle location 1789&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iain King]] has suggested the original position draws on Rawls' experiences in post-war Japan, where the US Army was challenged with designing new social and political authorities for the country, while "imagining away all that had gone before."&lt;ref&gt;"Deciding what this new (Japanese) society should look like was the task of the Supreme Command for the Allied Powers, and Rawls took this question – what should the rules of a society be – back to the US. But only in 1971 did he come up with a comprehensive answer. His theory starts by imagining away all that had gone before, just as the past had been erased in Hiroshima." Taken from [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-john-rawls.htm Thinker at War: Rawls], published in Military History Magazine, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In social justice processes, each person early on makes decisions about which features of persons to consider and which to ignore.  Rawls's aspiration is to have created a thought experiment whereby a version of that process is carried to its completion, illuminating the correct standpoint a person should take in his or her thinking about justice. If he has succeeded, then the original position thought experiment may function as a full specification of the moral standpoint we should attempt to achieve when deliberating about social justice.

In  setting out his theory, Rawls described his method as one of "[[reflective equilibrium]]", a concept which has since been used in other areas of philosophy. Reflective equilibrium is achieved by mutually adjusting one's general principles and one's considered judgements on particular cases, to bring the two into line with one another.

====Principles of justice====
Rawls derives two principles of justice from the original position. The first of these is the Liberty Principle, which establishes equal basic liberties for all citizens. 'Basic' liberty entails the (familiar in the liberal tradition) freedoms of conscience, association and expression as well as democratic rights; Rawls also includes a ''personal property'' right, but this is defended in terms of moral capacities and self-respect,&lt;ref name=Rawls_114&gt;{{Harvnb|Rawls|2001|pp=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than an appeal to a natural right of self-ownership (this distinguishes Rawls's account from the [[classical liberalism]] of John Locke and the [[libertarianism]] of Robert Nozick).

Rawls argues that a second principle of equality would be agreed upon to guarantee liberties that represent meaningful options for all in society and ensure distributive justice. For example, formal guarantees of political voice and freedom of assembly are of little real worth to the desperately poor and marginalized in society. Demanding that everyone have exactly the same effective opportunities in life would almost certainly offend the very liberties that are supposedly being equalized. Nonetheless, we would want to ensure at least the "fair worth" of our liberties: wherever one ends up in society, one wants life to be worth living, with enough effective freedom to pursue personal goals. Thus participants would be moved to affirm a two-part second principle comprising Fair Equality of Opportunity and the famous (and controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nozick|first1=Robert|title=Anarchy, State, and Utopia|pages=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Justice as Fairness#Difference Principle|difference principle]]. This second principle ensures that those with comparable talents and motivation face roughly similar life chances and that inequalities in society work to the benefit of the least advantaged.

Rawls held that these principles of justice apply to the "basic structure" of fundamental social institutions (such as the judiciary, the economic structure and the political constitution), a qualification that has been the source of some controversy and constructive debate (see the work of [[Gerald Cohen]]).

Rawls further argued that these principles were to be 'lexically ordered' to award priority to basic liberties over the more equality-oriented demands of the second principle. This has also been a topic of much debate among moral and political philosophers.

Finally, Rawls took his approach as applying in the first instance to what he called a "well-ordered society ... designed to advance the good of its members and effectively regulated by a public conception of justice".&lt;ref name=Rawls_397&gt;{{Harvnb|Rawls|1971|pp=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, he understood justice as fairness as a contribution to "ideal theory", the determination of "principles that characterize a well-ordered society under favorable circumstances".&lt;ref name=Rawls_216&gt;{{Harvnb|Rawls|1971|pp=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much recent work in political philosophy has asked what justice as fairness might dictate (or indeed, whether it is very useful at all) for problems of "partial compliance" under "nonideal theory".{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===''Political Liberalism''===
In ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' (1993), Rawls turned towards the question of political legitimacy in the context of intractable philosophical, religious, and moral disagreement amongst citizens regarding the human good. Such disagreement, he insisted, was reasonable – the result of the free exercise of human rationality under the conditions of open enquiry and free conscience that the liberal state is designed to safeguard. The question of legitimacy in the face of reasonable disagreement was urgent for Rawls because his own justification of Justice as Fairness relied upon a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] conception of the human good that can be reasonably rejected. If the political conception offered in ''A Theory of Justice'' can only be shown to be good by invoking a controversial conception of human flourishing, it is unclear how a liberal state ordered according to it could possibly be legitimate.

The intuition animating this seemingly new concern is actually no different from the guiding idea of ''A Theory of Justice'', namely that the fundamental charter of a society must rely only on principles, arguments and reasons that cannot be reasonably rejected by the citizens whose lives will be limited by its social, legal, and political circumscriptions. In other words, the legitimacy of a law is contingent upon its justification being impossible to reasonably reject. This old insight took on a new shape, however, when Rawls realized that its application must extend to the deep justification of Justice as Fairness itself, which he had presented in terms of a reasonably rejectable (Kantian) conception of human flourishing as the free development of autonomous moral agency.

The core of Political Liberalism, accordingly, is its insistence that, in order to retain its legitimacy, the liberal state must commit itself to the "ideal of [[public reason]]". This roughly means  that citizens in their public capacity must engage one another only in terms of reasons whose status ''as'' reasons is shared between them. Political reasoning, then, is to proceed purely in terms of "public reasons". For example: a Supreme Court justice deliberating on whether or not the denial to homosexuals of the ability to marry constitutes a violation of the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause may not advert to his religious convictions on the matter, but he may take into account the argument that a same-sex household provides sub-optimal conditions for a child's development. This is because reasons based upon the interpretation of sacred text are non-public (their force as reasons relies upon faith commitments that can be reasonably rejected), whereas reasons that rely upon the value of providing children with environments in which they may develop optimally are public reasons – their status as reasons draws upon no deep, controversial conception of human flourishing.

Rawls held that the duty of civility – the duty of citizens to offer one another reasons that are mutually understood as reasons – applies within what he called the "public political forum". This forum extends from the upper reaches of government – for example the supreme legislative and judicial bodies of the society – all the way down to the deliberations of a citizen deciding for whom to vote in state legislatures or how to vote in public referenda. Campaigning politicians should also, he believed, refrain from pandering to the non-public religious or moral convictions of their constituencies.

The ideal of public reason secures the dominance of the public political values – freedom, equality, and fairness – that serve as the foundation of the liberal state. But what about the justification of these values? Since any such justification would necessarily draw upon deep (religious or moral) metaphysical commitments which would be reasonably rejectable, Rawls held that the public political values may only be justified privately by individual citizens. The public liberal political conception and its attendant values may and will be affirmed publicly (in judicial opinions and presidential addresses, for example) but its deep justifications will not. The task of justification falls to what Rawls called the "reasonable comprehensive doctrines" and the citizens who subscribe to them. A reasonable Catholic will justify the liberal values one way, a reasonable Muslim another, and a reasonable secular citizen yet another way. One may illustrate Rawls's idea using a Venn diagram: the public political values will be the shared space upon which overlap numerous reasonable comprehensive doctrines. Rawls's account of stability presented in ''A Theory of Justice'' is a detailed portrait of the compatibility of one – Kantian – comprehensive doctrine with justice as fairness. His hope is that similar accounts may be presented for many other comprehensive doctrines. This is Rawls's famous notion of an "[[overlapping consensus]]".

Such a consensus would necessarily exclude some doctrines, namely, those that are "unreasonable", and so one may wonder what Rawls has to say about such doctrines. An unreasonable comprehensive doctrine is unreasonable in the sense that it is incompatible with the duty of civility. This is simply another way of saying that an unreasonable doctrine is incompatible with the fundamental political values a liberal theory of justice is designed to safeguard – freedom, equality and fairness. So one answer to the question of what Rawls has to say about such doctrines is – nothing. For one thing, the liberal state cannot justify itself to individuals (such as religious fundamentalists) who hold to such doctrines, because any such justification would – as has been noted – proceed in terms of controversial moral or religious commitments that are excluded from the public political forum. But, more importantly, the goal of the Rawlsian project is primarily to determine whether or not the liberal conception of political legitimacy is internally coherent, and this project is carried out by the specification of what sorts of reasons persons committed to liberal values are permitted to use in their dialogue, deliberations and arguments with one another about political matters. The Rawlsian project has this goal to the exclusion of concern with justifying liberal values to those not already committed – or at least open – to them. Rawls's concern is with whether or not the idea of political legitimacy fleshed out in terms of the duty of civility and mutual justification can serve as a viable form of public discourse in the face of the religious and moral pluralism of modern democratic society, not with justifying this conception of political legitimacy in the first place.

Rawls also modified the principles of justice as follows (with the first principle having priority over the second, and the first half of the second having priority over the latter half):

# Each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of basic rights and liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme for all; and in this scheme the equal political liberties, and only those liberties, are to be guaranteed their fair value.
# Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: first, they are to be attached to positions and offices open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; and second, they are to be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society.

These principles are subtly modified from the principles in ''Theory''. The first principle now reads "equal claim" instead of "equal right", and he also replaces the phrase "system of basic liberties" with "a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties". The two parts of the second principle are also switched, so that the difference principle becomes the latter of the three.

===''The Law of Peoples''===
{{Main|The Law of Peoples}}
Although there were passing comments on international affairs in ''A Theory of Justice'', it wasn't until late in his career that Rawls formulated a comprehensive theory of international politics with the publication of ''The Law of Peoples''.  He claimed there that "well-ordered" peoples could be either "liberal" or "decent".  Rawls argued that the legitimacy of a liberal international order is contingent on tolerating ''decent peoples'', which differ from ''liberal peoples'', among other ways, in that they might have state religions and deny adherents of [[minority group|minority]] [[faith]]s the right to hold positions of power within the state, and might organize political participation via consultation hierarchies rather than elections. However, no well-ordered peoples may violate human rights or behave in an externally aggressive manner. Peoples that fail to meet the criteria of "liberal" or "decent" peoples are referred to as "outlaw states", "societies burdened by unfavourable conditions" or "benevolent absolutisms" depending on their particular failings. Such peoples do not have the right to mutual respect and toleration possessed by liberal and decent peoples.

Rawls's views on global distributive justice as they were expressed in this work surprised many of his fellow egalitarian liberals. For example, [[Charles Beitz]] had previously written a study that argued for the application of Rawls's Difference Principles globally. Rawls denied that his principles should be so applied, partly on the grounds that states, unlike citizens, were self-sufficient in the cooperative enterprises that constitute domestic societies.  Although Rawls recognized that aid should be given to governments which are unable to protect human rights for economic reasons, he claimed that the purpose for this aid is not to achieve an eventual state of global equality, but rather only to ensure that these societies could maintain liberal or decent political institutions.  He argued, among other things, that continuing to give aid indefinitely would see nations with industrious populations subsidize those with idle populations and would create a [[moral hazard]] problem where governments could spend irresponsibly in the knowledge that they will be bailed out by those nations who had spent responsibly.

Rawls's discussion of "non-ideal" theory, on the other hand, included a condemnation of bombing civilians and of the American bombing of German and Japanese cities in [[World War II]], as well as discussions of immigration and nuclear proliferation. He also detailed here the ideal of the statesman, a political leader who looks to the next generation and promotes international harmony, even in the face of significant domestic pressure to act otherwise. Rawls also controversially claimed that violations of human rights can legitimize military intervention in the violating states, though he also expressed the hope that such societies could be induced to reform peacefully by the good example of liberal and decent peoples.

==Reception and influence==
John Rawls is the subject of ''[[A Theory of Justice: The Musical!]]'', an award-nominated musical billed as an "all-singing, all-dancing romp through 2,500 years of political philosophy". The musical premiered at Oxford in 2013 and was revived for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherwell.org/news/college/2012/10/02/ppe-finalists-create-revision-musical |title=Oxford / News / Colleges / PPE finalists create revision musical |publisher=Cherwell.org |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of John Rawls have had wide-ranging influence. In the field of religious and moral education, Rawls's concepts of overlapping consensus, reasonable pluralism and hypothetical contract have been applied to consider problems of fairness and representation in public education, yielding conclusions that differ substantially from his own position on these matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Daniel|last2=Robson|first2=James|date=2012|title=Doing God in a liberal democracy|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03054985.2012.722863|journal=Oxford Review of Education|language=en|volume=38|issue=5|pages=539–550|doi=10.1080/03054985.2012.722863|issn=0305-4985|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Dan|date=2009|title=A too liberal religious education?

'''''Julian and Maddalo: A Conversation''''' (1818–[[1819 in poetry|19]]) is a poem in 617 lines of [[Enjambment|enjambed]] [[Heroic verse|heroic couplets]] by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] published posthumously in 1824. 

==Background==
It was written in the autumn of 1818 at a villa called I Capuccini, in [[Este, Italy|Este]], near [[Venice]], which had been lent to Shelley by his friend [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], and it was given its final revision in 1819. Shelley originally intended the poem to appear in ''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]'', a [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical]] paper edited by [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]], but then decided instead on anonymous publication by [[Charles Ollier]]. This plan fell through, and ''Julian and Maddalo'' first appeared after Shelley's death in a volume of his works called ''Posthumous Poems'' in 1824 (see [[1824 in poetry]]), edited by [[Mary Shelley|his widow]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Saintsbury]] ''A History of English Prosody: From the Twelfth Century to the Present Day'' (London: Macmillan, 1923) vol. 3, p. 108; Thomas Hutchinson (ed.) ''The Complete Poetical Works of Shelley'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1904) pp. 204, 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt; It is inspired by conversations Shelley had with Byron in Venice in 1818, in which they explored their different outlooks on life.  The bitter cynicism of Count Maddalo in the poem reflects closely Lord Byron's views, as Julian's atheism and faith in the potentialities of man does those of Shelley himself.  It is written in a conversational, natural style, which had not until then been usual in Shelley's works, and which may have been partly suggested by Byron's poem ''Beppo''.  ''Julian and Maddalo'' was in its turn a strong influence on the [[dramatic monologue]]s of [[Robert Browning]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir A. W. Ward and A. R. Waller (eds.) ''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature|The Cambridge History of English Literature]]'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1915) vol. 12, p. 63; "Julian and Maddalo: A Conversation"  ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''.

== Synopsis ==
[[File:Maddalo.jpg|left|thumb|1819 draft of ''Julian and Maddalo: A Conversation''. Bodleian Library.]]
"Julian and Maddalo" is prefaced by a prose description of the main characters.  Maddalo is described as a rich [[Venice|Venetian]] nobleman whose "passions and…powers are incomparably greater than those of other men; and, instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the former, they have mutually lent each other strength"; while Julian is said to be
&lt;blockquote&gt;an Englishman of good family, passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind, and the immense improvements of which, by the extinction of certain moral superstitions, human society may be yet susceptible…He is a complete infidel, and a scoffer at all things reputed holy.&lt;ref&gt;Preface&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The poem proper then begins with a depiction of the two title characters riding through a Venetian scene and discussing the subjects of religious faith, free will and progress. Julian
&lt;blockquote&gt; Argued against despondency, but pride&lt;br/&gt;Made my companion take the darker side.&lt;br/&gt;The sense that he was greater than his kind&lt;br/&gt;Had struck, methinks, his eagle spirit blind&lt;br/&gt;By gazing on its own exceeding light.&lt;ref&gt;Line 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
They then board the Count's gondola and pass a lunatic asylum, which provokes from Maddalo a comparison between the inmates' situation and the futility of all mortal life. The next day Julian visits Maddalo and meets his baby daughter (based on [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]]'s daughter [[Allegra Byron|Allegra]]),&lt;ref&gt;"Julian and Maddalo: A Conversation"  ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''. Edited by Dinah Birch. Oxford University Press Inc. ''Oxford Reference Online''. Oxford University Press.  West Sussex County Library Service.  24 December 2009  &lt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t113.e4098&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; whose childish innocence inspires him to a statement of his own optimistic belief in the power of Good.  Maddalo dismisses Julian's creed as [[Utopia]]n, and compares him with a former friend who has since gone mad known as the Maniac. They again take the gondola to the madhouse to meet this man, the Maniac, who tells them a confused and disconnected account of an ill-fated romance and of his abandonment by his lover. (This character has been identified by scholars as a composite of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] himself and the poet [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]; the lover perhaps as [[Mary Shelley]], whose relationship with the poet had lately been under some strain.)&lt;ref&gt;"Julian and Maddalo: A Conversation"  ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''. Edited by Dinah Birch. Oxford University Press Inc. ''Oxford Reference Online''. Oxford University Press.  West Sussex County Library Service.  24 December 2009  &lt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t113.e4098&gt;; H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison (eds.) ''The Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004) vol. 50, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Julian and Maddalo are downcast by the Maniac's story, Maddalo commenting that
&lt;blockquote&gt;Most wretched men&lt;br/&gt;Are cradled into poetry by wrong,&lt;br/&gt;They learn in suffering what they teach in song.&lt;ref&gt;Line 544.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Julian leaves Venice but, returning many years later, asks Maddalo's daughter about the madman or the Maniac and is told that his lover had returned and again left him, and that both were now dead.

'''''Les Diaboliques''''' (''The She-Devils'') is a collection of [[short story|short stories]] written by [[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly|Barbey d'Aurevilly]] and published in [[France]] in 1874. Each story features a woman who commits an act of violence, or revenge, or some other crime. It is considered d'Aurevilly's masterpiece.&lt;ref name=irwin&gt;Robert Irwin. ''Barbey D'Aurevilly and the Satanism of Appearance'' in &lt;u&gt;Les Diaboliques&lt;/u&gt;, 11-14. (Dedalus: Langford Lodge, St Judith's Lane Sawtry, Cambs, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Aurevilly, due to the boredom induced by [[bourgeois]] life in the [[Second French Republic]], was a [[dandy]]. Similarly, the acts committed by the characters in these stories are induced not only by their extreme passion but also by their boredom. Some of the characters spend hours playing [[whist]] while others take delight in wearing fine clothes. All of the female characters are best at concealing their passions and are strong, independent instigators.&lt;ref name=irwin /&gt;

D'Aurevilly uses ''récit parlé'', a bracketing narrative, as a structural tool for five of the six short stories.

==Content==

*"The Crimson Curtain": An old [[vicomte]] tells a younger friend about his first sexual experience with a woman.
*"The Greatest Love of Don Juan": An aged playboy, surrounded by past lovers, relates the tale of his greatest love affair.
*"Happiness in Crime": A [[Count|comte]] falls in love with a skilled [[fencing|fencer]] and hires her as his wife's maid.
*"Beneath the Cards of a Game of Whist": The secret affair of a lady and an expert whist player leads to an horrific act.
*"At a Dinner of Atheists": A French officer relates a tale of love and lust with the wife of one of his fellow officers.
*"A Woman's Revenge": A wealthy princess spurns her ignoble husband by becoming a cheap prostitute.

==Publication==
D'Aurevilly wrote "The Crimson Curtain" in 1866. "The Greatest Love of Don Juan" followed in 1867. In 1870, d'Aurevilly retired to the [[Contentin Peninsula]] and finished the collection.

When the collection was first published in France in 1874, it caused up an uproar with the [[France|French]] public and the work was declared a danger to [[public morality]] and the Public Prosecutor issued orders for its seizure on the grounds of [[blasphemy]] and [[obscenity]]. D'Aurevilly defended the work, albeit tongue-in-cheek, by saying that he himself was a [[Christianity|Christian]] and the stories demonstrated the battle of good against evil.&lt;ref name=irwin /&gt;

A second edition was published in 1882. [[Dedalus Books]] published an English-language version in 1996.

==Film adaptations==
* ''[[A Woman's Revenge (1921 film)|A Woman's Revenge]]'' (1921), directed by [[Robert Wiene]], based on "A Woman's Revenge"
* ''[[The Crimson Curtain (1953 film)|The Crimson Curtain]]'' (1953), directed by [[Alexandre Astruc]], based on "The Crimson Curtain"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43081">The '''Governor General's Awards in Visual and Media Arts''' are Canadian awards given each year to recognize outstanding contribution to the fields of visual and media arts. The awards were created in 2000 by then [[Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]]. The awards are funded and administered by the [[Canada Council|Canada Council for the Arts]].

An independent peer jury of senior visual and media arts professionals selects up to seven laureates to be recognized for artistic achievement and one award for outstanding contributions in a professional or volunteer role. Visual and media artists in fine arts (painting, drawing, photography, print-making and sculpture, including installation and other three-dimensional work), applied arts (architecture and fine crafts), independent film and video, or audio and new media are eligible for the annual award. Since 2007, the Saidye Bronfman Award for excellence in the fine crafts is also awarded by this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Awards|url=http://ggavma.canadacouncil.ca/the_awards-les_prix|website=Governor General’s Awards in Visual and Media Arts|publisher=Canada Council for the Arts|accessdate=25 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316093609/http://ggavma.canadacouncil.ca/the_awards-les_prix|archivedate=16 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, each laureate received $25,000 and recognition in the form of an exhibition at the [[National Gallery of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=James|title=Eight Canadian visual and media artists win Governor-General Awards|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/career-excellence-awards-announced/article23579655/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of dance personalities}}

An annotated '''list of popular/famous dancers'''.

{{compact ToC|num=yes}}

== A ==

*[[Fifi Abdou]] (born {{Birth date|1953|04|26|df=yes}}), Egyptian [[belly dancer]] and actress. She rose to fame in the 1970s, and was one of the most famous and successful Egyptian dance stars throughout the 1980s and 1990s until her retirement in the 2000s. She has been the subject of several controversies during her long career.
*[[Paula Abdul]] (born {{Birth date|1962|06|16|df=yes}}), American recording artist, dancer, choreographer, and actress. Before achieving widespread fame as a recording artist in the early 1990s, Abdul, a former high school [[cheerleader]], was a heavily sought-after choreographer who has designed dance routines for several well-known performers, including singer [[Janet Jackson]]. In her music videos, Abdul has exhibited skills in a variety of dance styles, including [[hip-hop dance|hip-hop]], [[tap dance|tap]], and [[Freestyle dance|freestyle]]. Abdul's major television breakthrough came in 2002, when she became a judge on the popular reality television talent competition ''[[American Idol]]'', a role in which she remained for seven years. In 2011 Abdul was one of the judges on the American version of ''[[The X Factor (U.S.)|The X Factor]]'', another reality television singing competition.
*[[Fred Astaire]] ({{Birth date|1899|05|10|df=yes}} – {{Death date|1987|06|22|df=yes}}), American film and Broadway stage dancer, choreographer, singer, musician and actor. He was an innovator in dance. He made 31 musical films and was honored with the fifth Greatest Male Star of All Time by the [[American Film Institute]].

==B==
*[[George Balanchine]] ({{Birth date|1904|01|22|df=yes}} – {{Death date|1983|04|30|df=yes}}), Georgian ballet choreographer. He is one of the 20th century's foremost choreographers, and one of the founders of American ballet. His work formed a bridge between classical and modern ballet. Apollo is Balanchine's oldest surviving ballet and his first great public ballet which Balanchine was to become renowned for. It premiered on June 12, 1928 by Les Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghilev at the Théâtre Sarah Bernhart in Paris. Balanchine looked upon Apollo as the turning point of his life, "in its sustained oneness of tone and feeling". The story centers around Apollo, the god of the sun, who is visited by three muses: Terpsichore, muse of dance; Polyhymnia, muse of hymns; and Calliope, muse of poetry. Balanchine created ballet sequences for Ravel's opera ''L'enfant et les sortilèges'' to Colette's libretto with what Ravel described as "Russian dancers", presumably from the Ballets Russes for the 1925 Monte Carlo premiere, although this is not listed as a Ballets Russes production.
*[[Sara Baras]] (born 1971), female [[Flamenco]] Dancer, born in the port of Cadiz. She is internationally famous and regularly tours the world. She has won a number of awards including the Madroño Flamenco of Montellano (Seville) in 1993,and in 1999 and 2001, she received a prize for the Best Female Spanish Dance Performer.
*[[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] (born {{Birth date|1948|01|28|df=yes}}), Soviet-born Russian American dancer, choreographer, and actor, often cited alongside [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] and [[Rudolf Nureyev]] as one of the greatest ballet dancers of the 20th century. After a promising start in the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad, he defected to Canada in 1974 and went on to become a principal dancer and artistic director with the American Ballet Theatre and the New York City Ballet in New York City. He has spearheaded many of his own artistic projects and has been associated in particular with promoting modern dance, premiering dozens of new works, including many of his own. His success as a dramatic actor on stage, cinema and television has helped him become probably the most widely recognized contemporary dancer.
*[[Bez (dancer)|Bez]] (born {{Birth date|1964|04|18|df=yes}}), renowned as the dancer for the [[Happy Mondays]].
*[[Vytautas Beliajus]] ({{Birth date|1908|02|26|df=yes}} – September 1994), considered the father of [[international folk dancing]] in the United States. He specialized in [[Music of Lithuania|Lithuanian dance]], but performed and taught many other types of dance as well. He published multiple books on the subjects of dance and ethnicity, and also started the folklore magazine Viltis. Beliajus was born in Lithuania and emigrated to the U.S. when he was 14 years old. He had two younger brothers, Leonas and Julius, and a sister, Gyte Jekentes.
*[[Carlo Blasis]] ({{Birth date|1797|11|04|df=yes}} – {{Death date|1878|01|15|df=yes}}), Italian dancer, choreographer and dance theoretician. He is well known for his very rigorous dance classes, sometimes lasting four hours long. He was the first who published an analysis on the ballet techniques in 1820, in a work named ''Traité élémentaire, théorique, et pratique de l'art de la danse'' (''Elementary Treaty on the Art of the Dance, theory and practice''). He is most known for the pose "Attitude" derived from the famous statue Mercury by Giovanni da Bologna. He taught [[Enrico Cecchetti]], who expanded his technique.
*[[Chrystelle Trump Bond]], American dancer, choreographer, and dance historian
*[[James Brown]] or James Joseph Brown, Jr. ({{Birth date|1933|05|03|df=yes}} – {{Death date|2006|12|25|df=yes}}), commonly referred to as "The Godfather of Soul", "Mr. Dynamite", the "King of Funk", "Soul Brother #1" and "The Hardest Working Man in Show Business", was an American entertainer (singer and dancer). He is recognized as one of the most influential figures in 20th-century popular music and was renowned for his vocals and feverish dancing. As a prolific singer, songwriter and bandleader, Brown was a pivotal force in the music industry. He left his mark on numerous artists. Brown's music also left its mark on the rhythms of African popular music, such as afrobeat, jùjú and mbalax, and provided a template for go-go music. Brown began his professional music career in 1953 and rose to fame during the late 1950s and early 1960s on the strength of his thrilling live performances and string of smash hits. During the early 1980s, Brown's music helped to shape the rhythms of early hip-hop music, with numerous groups looping or sampling his funk grooves and turning them into what became hip hop classics and the foundations of the music and dance genre. Brown danced vigorously as he sang, working popular dance steps such as the [[Mashed Potato]] into his routine along with dramatic leaps, splits and slides. In addition, his horn players and backup singers ([[The Famous Flames]]) typically performed choreographed dance routines, and later incarnations of the [[Revue]] included backup dancers. Male performers in the Revue were required to wear tuxedos and cummerbunds long after more casual concert wear became the norm among the younger musical acts. Brown's own extravagant outfits and his elaborate processed hairdo completed the visual impression.
*[[Jean Butler]] (born {{Birth date|1971|03|14|df=yes}}), Irish [[step dancer]].She began training in Irish dance at the age of four with the widely respected teacher Donny Golden. She also participated in tap and ballet classes, but step dance became her focus. Her talent was clear from a young age, and she competed in regional, national and international championships. She and her sister, Cara Butler, both went on to win numerous national titles and regional titles, and placing well in international competitions. Jean has performed with Green Fields of America and Cherish the Ladies. She debuted with The Chieftains at Carnegie Hall at the age of seventeen, and toured with them on three continents.

By 1888, he was widely accepted as the greatest ballet virtuoso in the world. The general populace was not aware that he could only turn in one direction and in fact, had to have all his choreography tailored especially to accommodate this weakness.
*[[Vernon and Irene Castle]], husband-and-wife team of ballroom dancers of the early 20th century. They are credited with invigorating the popularity of [[modern dancing]]. [[Vernon Castle]] (May 2, 1887 - February 15, 1918), born William Vernon Blyth in England. [[Irene Castle]] (April 17, 1893 - January 25, 1969) was born New York.

*[[Joaquín Cortés]] (born February 22, 1969), classically trained ballet and [[flamenco]] dancer from Spain of Roma origin. Cortés formed the Joaquín Cortés Flamenco Ballet company and launched his first international tour ‘Cibayí’ in 1992.

On May 15, 2007 he performed as a guest dancer in a high-profile semi-final segment on ABC's ''Dancing with the Star''s.
*[[Merce Cunningham]] (born April 16, 1919), American dancer and choreographer. Cunningham was born in Centralia, Washington, and received his first formal dance and theater training at the Cornish School (now Cornish College of the Arts) in Seattle. [[Merce Cunningham]] Dance Company was formed at Black Mountain College in the summer of 1953. Since that time Cunningham has choreographed nearly 200 works for his company. In 1973 he choreographed Un jour ou deux for the Ballet of the Paris Opéra, with music by Cage and set design by Jasper Johns. The Ballet of the Paris Opéra also performed a revival of his ''Points in Space'' in 1990. His work has also been presented by New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Boston Ballet, White Oak Dance Project, Pacific Northwest Ballet, Pennsylvania Ballet, Zurich Ballet, and Rambert Dance Company (London), among others. Cunningham's interest in contemporary technology has led him to work with the computer program Dance Forms, which he has used in making all his dances since ''Trackers'' (1991).Another of Cunningham's innovations was the development of what might be called "non-representative" dance which simply emphasizes movement: in Cunningham's choreography, dancers do not necessarily represent any historical figure, emotional situation, or idea.

* [[Nicole de Weever]] (born 1979), Sint Maarten dancer and choreographer
*[[Sergei Pavlovich Diaghilev]], also referred to as Serge, (March 31, 1872 – August 19, 1929) was a Russian art critic, patron, ballet impresario and founder of the Ballets Russes from which many famous dancers and choreographers would later arise. Diaghilev staged [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''The Sleeping Beauty'' in London in 1921; it was a production of remarkable magnificence both in settings and costumes, but despite being well received by the public it was a financial disaster for Diaghilev and Oswald Stoll, the theatre-owner, who had backed it. The first cast included the legendary ballerina Olga Spessivtseva. Diaghilev insisted on calling the ballet ''The Sleeping Princess''. When asked why, he quipped, "Because I have no beauties!" The later years of the Ballets Russes were often considered too "intellectual", too "stylish" and seldom had the unconditional success of the first few seasons, although younger choreographers like [[George Balanchine]] hit their stride with the Ballet Russes.
*[[Charles-Louis Didelot]] (27 March 1767 – 7 November 1837), French dancer and choreographer. The son of Charles Didelot, the dance maestro of the King of Sweden, he studied dance with his father, who were instructor in dance at the Swedish Opera, and dubuted as dancer in the theatre of Bollhuset in Stockholm 1786.

*[[Isadora Duncan]] (May 27, 1877 – September 14, 1927), American dancer. She was born Angela Isadora Duncan in San Francisco, California and is considered by many to be the mother of [[Modern Dance]]. Although never very popular in the United States, she entertained throughout Europe.
*[[Lucinda Dickey]] (born August 14, 1960), American dancer and actress who is best known for her role as Kelly in the 1984 cult film Breakin’ and the 1984 sequel, Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo. Dickey was born and raised in Hutchinson, Kansas, where at the age of four, she began dancing. While attending college at Kansas State University, she majored in dance and competed in the Miss Kansas pageant, where she won the talent division and finished third runner-up.After college, Dickey moved to Los Angeles and won a dance scholarship with the Roland DuPree Dance Academy. After 10 months, she auditioned for the movie Grease 2, winning a role as one of film's lead dancers. That same year (1982) she landed a stint as a dancer on Solid Gold.
*[[Doctor Ice]], influenced [[Hip-Hop]] dancing to a new form. His influence can be noted by the dance moves in videos done by artists such as [[Kid N Play]], Scrap Lover and Scoop Lover (dancers for [[Big Daddy Kane]]) and G-Wiz and the late Trouble T-Roy (from [[Heavy D &amp; The Boyz]]). The commercial world fashioned their dance moves after Michael Jackson but the black community embraced Doc Ice because his dancing was reflective of the type of dance moves done at a house/block party or in the nightclub. He left UTFO in the late 1980s before the group's breakup in 1991 to go on a solo career. His first album, The Mic Stalker in 1989, produced by R&amp;B group Full Force, had the singles 'Word to the Wise', 'Love Jones', and 'Sue Me'. Ice also collaborated with [[Dino (singer)]], for his 1990 song 'Romeo' (charting at #6) on the album "''Swingin'''". His second album, "''Rely on Self''" appeared in 1994.

Dunham had one of the most successful dance careers in American and European theater of the 20th century and has been called the Matriarch and Queen Mother of Black Dance. During her heyday in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, she was renowned throughout Europe and Latin America as La Grande Katherine, and the Washington Post called her "Dance's Katherine the Great." For more than 30 years she maintained the Katherine Dunham Dance Company, the only permanent, self-subsidized American black dance troupe at that time, and over her long career she choreographed more than 90 individual dances. Dunham was an innovator in African-American [[modern dance]] as well as a leader in the field of dance anthropology, or [[ethnochoreology]] (see also dance studies). She died in her sleep in New York City on 21 May 2006.

*[[Danny Tidwell]] (born August 1, 1984 in Norfolk, Virginia), American contemporary and ballet dancer and choreographer, best known for being the runner-up on Fox's third season of ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'' in 2007. Tidwell began dancing as a child, at first focusing on [[jazz]] before changing to ballet while attending Kirov Academy of Ballet at the age of fifteen. He has worked in elite companies, including the American Ballet Theater. He has also performed the works of renowned choreographers, including Debbie Allen, William Forsythe and Mia Michaels. He is [[Travis Wall]]'s brother, also a runner-up, of the second season of ''So You Think You Can Dance''.
*[[Eddie Torres]] (born on July 3, 1950), one of the most famous [[Salsa (dance)|salsa dance]] instructors in the world. He has trained thousands of dancers, including some of the most well known contemporary dancers. Through his dance school, he has taught thousands of people how to dance salsa in his own distinctive style. He also has a children's dance program that teaches approximately three hundred students a year.
*[[Antony Tudor]] (4 April 1908 – 19 April 1987), born William Cook, highly influential 20th-century English ballet choreographer, teacher and dancer. Antony Tudor is generally accepted to be one of the great originals of modern dance forms. Along with [[George Balanchine]], he is seen as a principal transformer of ballet into a [[modern art]], but of a genius that uses, rather than proceeds from, ballet forms. His work is usually considered as modern "psychological" expression, but—like their creator–of austerity, elegance and nobility.

== U ==
*[[Uday Shankar]] (December 8, 1900 – September 26, 1977) (Bengali: উদয় শংকর), the pioneer of modern dance in India, and a world renowned Indian dancer and choreographer, was most known for adapting Western theatrical techniques to traditional Indian classical dance, imbued with elements of Indian classical, folk, and tribal dance, thus laying the roots of modern Indian dance, which he later popularized in India, Europe, and the United States in 1920s and 1930s.
*[[Galina Ulanova]] ({{OldStyleDateDY|8 January|1910|26 December 1909}} {{spaced ndash}} 21 March 1998), Russian ballet dancer. She is frequently cited as being one of the greatest [[ballerina]]s of the 20th century. From 1944 to 1960 she was the [[prima ballerina assoluta]] of the [[Bolshoi Theater]].

==V==
*[[Agrippina Yakovlevna Vaganova]] (July 6, 1879 – November 5, 1951), outstanding Russian ballet teacher who developed the [[Vaganova method]] - the technique which derived from the teaching methods of the old Imperial Ballet School (today the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet) under the Premier Maître de Ballet Marius Petipa throughout the mid-to-late 19th century, though mostly throughout the 1880s and 1890s. It was Vaganova who perfected and cultivated this form of teaching the art of classical ballet into a workable syllabus. Her Fundamentals of the Classical Dance (1934) remains a standard textbook for the instruction of ballet technique.

==W==
*[[John Weaver (dancer)|John Weaver]] (July 21, 1673 – September 24, 1760), dancer and choreographer and is commonly known as the father of English [[pantomime]]. Weaver was born in Shrewsbury. His father, a dance teacher, suggested he go to London and become a ballet master. Weaver soon became a specialist in comic roles and created the first pantomime ballet, the burlesque Tavern Bilkers (1702). His more serious work'', The Loves of Mars and Venus'' dealt with themes from classical literature and required a significant amount of gestures due to the story not being expressed in any spoken form. Because Weaver attempted to use plot and emotion in replacement of more sophisticated technical and speech methods, he is considered a major influence on subsequent choreographers, including [[Jean-Georges Noverre]] and [[Gasparo Angiolini]].
*[[Charles Edward Weidman]], Jr. (1901 in Lincoln, Nebraska – 1975), modern dancer, choreographer and teacher. He studied and performed with Denishawn before leaving to form the [[Humphrey-Weidman]] school and company with [[Doris Humphrey]] and Pauline Lawrence. Like his partner Humphrey, Weidman worked from principles of fall and recovery and also experimented with a form of linking unrelated movements that he called "kinetic pantomime." During the 1930s, Weidman taught at the Bennington School of the Dance in Vermont and presented choreography including his popular ''Candide'' (1937) through the Federal Dance Theatre of the WPA.
*[[Mary Wigman]] (1886 – 1973), German dancer, choreographer, and instructor of dance. Credited for innovation of expressionist dance, and pioneer of [[modern dance]] in Germany. Mary Wigman's choreographies often employed non-Western instrumentation: fifes, bells, gongs, and drums from India, Thailand, Africa, and China. However, the primary musical accompaniment for her most well known dances was percussion, which contrasted greatly with her use of silence. Mary would often employ masks in her pieces, influenced again by non-western/tribal motifs, as well as ecstatic spinning.

A total of 29 sculptures&lt;ref group=note&gt;With the monuments erected against the park's outer walls, the total of sculptures in the care of the [[Central Park Conservancy]] is described as "over fifty".&lt;/ref&gt; have appeared since 1863 in [[New York City]]'s {{convert|843|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Central Park]]. Most have been donated by individuals or organizations, few by the city itself. While many early statues are of authors and poets along "Literary Walk" and American figures like [[Daniel Webster]] and "the Pilgrim", other early works were simply picturesque, like ''The Hunter'' and ''The Falconer''; other notable statues include sled dog [[Balto]], the so-called "[[Cleopatra's Needle (New York)|Cleopatra's Needle]]"—an Egyptian [[obelisk]]—[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice]] of Wonderland, and most recently [[Duke Ellington]].

==Selected sculptures==

===Animals===
[[File:Balto.jpg|thumb|upright|''Balto'']]
* '''''[[Balto]]''''' was dedicated to the sled dogs that led several dogsled teams through a snow-storm in the winter of 1925 in order to deliver [[medicine]] that would stop a [[diphtheria]] epidemic in [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Alaska]]. The sculpture is slightly larger than the real-life dog, and is placed on a rock outcropping on the main path leading north from the Tisch Children's Zoo. The sculpture was created by [[Frederick George Richard Roth]], and placed in the park in 1925. Like so many other [[monument]]s in the park, it's made of [[bronze]], and it was donated to the park by the Balto Monument Committee to the City of [[New York City|New York]].  Under the [[sculpture]], a small plaque can be found, containing the following inscription:
:&lt;center&gt;''Dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed antitoxins six hundred miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through Arctic blizzards from Nenana to the relief of stricken Nome in the Winter of 1925.  ENDURANCE • FIDELITY • INTELLIGENCE''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1328P5B46174F.49234&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!302803~!7&amp;ri=3&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=balto+new+york&amp;index=.GW&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=3|title=Balto, (sculpture)|last=|first=|date=|year=1993|website=|publisher=Save Outdoor Sculpture, New York, New York survey|others=Shahbaz Akhtar|accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

* '''''[[Eagles and Prey]]''''', designed and created by [[Christophe Fratin]], is the oldest known sculpture in any New York City park. It is made of bronze, and was cast in Paris, France in 1850 and was placed in the park in 1863. The sculpture was donated by [[Gordon Webster Burnham]], who also donated the statue of [[Daniel Webster]], as well as statues in other cities.  The monument depicts a goat, wedged accidentally between two rocks, which is about to be devoured by two [[eagle]]s. Their talons are sunk into the back of the goat as they flap their wings in victory.
* '''''Still Hunt''''' by sculptor [[Edward Kemeys]] (1843–1907) was placed in the park in 1883.  This bronze sculpture of a crouching [[cougar]] waiting to pounce, was created by Edward Kemeys, the famous American sculptor who also created the famous Hudson Bay wolves at the [[Philadelphia Zoo]], and lions at the entrance to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].  Situated on a rock outcrop on the west side of the East Drive at the edge of the Ramble, the crouching animal has scared many joggers as they climb "Cat Hill" (formally Cedar Hill) and approach this life-size and realistic representation. Unlike the traditional sculptures of other animals in the park that sit on a base or pedestal, Kemeys situated his animal directly on the rock ledge. Kemeys was so interested in depicting his animals in a realistic mode that he traveled to the western states to see them in their native habitat.

===Artists===

* Bust of the architect '''''[[Richard Morris Hunt]]''''' at the Hunt Memorial, along with two other figures sculpted by [[Daniel Chester French]]. Flanking the Hunt bust are statuettes, one holding a sculptor's mallet and a palette, representing the allied arts, while the other holds a model for the Administration Building at the [[Chicago]] [[World's Columbian Exposition]], designed by Hunt. On the perimeter wall of Central Park, Fifth Avenue and 70th Street, opposite the [[Frick Collection]], which was built on the site of the [[New York Public Library|Lenox Library]], also designed by architect Hunt. The granite and marble Hunt memorial was designed by American architect [[Bruce Price]].

• Tucked into a dead end triangle of Central Park at east 96/97th, the statue of [http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/albert-bertel-thorvaldsen.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/ Albert Bertel Thorvaldsen]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/albert-bertel-thorvaldsen.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/&lt;/ref&gt; was first dedicated in 1894 and is the only statue of an artist displayed in any New York City park.

===Fictional characters===

* One large sculpture depicts '''''[[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]''''', from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s 1865 classic ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. The statue is located on [[East 74th Street]] on the north side of Central Park's Conservatory Water. Alice is pictured sitting on a giant mushroom reaching toward a pocket watch held by the White Rabbit. Peering over her shoulder is the Cheshire cat, flanked on one side by the dormouse, and on the other by [[Mad Hatter]], who in contrast to the calm Alice looks ready to laugh out loud at any moment.  Publisher and philanthropist [[George T. Delacorte Jr.]] ordered the sculpture from [[José de Creeft]], in honor of Delacorte's late wife, Margarita, and to the enjoyment of the children of [[New York City|New York]]. Unveiled in 1959, de Creeft's sculpture tries to follow [[John Tenniel]]'s whimsical [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] illustrations from the first edition of the book. According to various sources, Alice is said to look like de Creeft's daughter Donna. The Alice in Wonderland project's architects and designers were Hideo Sasaki and Fernando Texidor, who inserted some plaques with inscriptions from the book in the terrace around the sculpture. Margarita's favorite poem, "The Jabberwocky" is also included; chiseled in a granite circle surrounding the sculpture:
''&lt;center&gt;'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe&lt;/center&gt;''
:The design of the sculpture attracts many children who want to climb its many levels, resulting in the bronze's glowing patina, polished by thousands of tiny hands over the years since the sculpture was unveiled.  It was cast at Modern Art Foundry Astoria Queens NY. The sculpture was in the music video of Slick Ricks Children's Story.

* The '''[[Burnett Memorial Fountain]]''', dedicated to the author [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]], was placed in the [[Conservatory Garden]] when it reopened in 1936, a donation by the ad hoc Children's Garden Building Committee. It was designed and created by [[Bessie Potter Vonnoh]] between 1926 and 1936. When Frances Hodgson Burnett died in 1924, some of her friends wanted to honor her memory by creating a storytelling area in Central Park. They chose the Conservatory Garden's south garden, at 104th Street and Fifth Avenue, as the site for the memorial. It is believed that the two figures, a reclining boy playing the flute and the young girl holding the bowl, represent Mary and Dickon, the main characters from ''[[The Secret Garden]]''.

===Historical figures===
[[File:SimonBolivarCentralParkNYC.JPG|thumb|right|upright|''Simón Bolívar'']]
[[File:christopher columbus321.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Christopher Columbus (Sunol)|Christopher Columbus]]'']]
* The [[equestrian sculpture]] of '''''[[Simón Bolívar]]''''' was originally sited on the rock outcropping between 82nd and 83rd Streets overlooking [[Central Park West]], where the [[Bolívar Hotel]], once facing it, commemorates its location. After Sixth Avenue was renamed [[Avenue of the Americas]] in 1945, the sculpture was relocated in the 1950s to be adjacent to those of fellow Latin American revolutionary leaders [[José de San Martín]] and [[José Martí]] at the head of the Avenue of the Americas.
* In 1892, '''''[[Christopher Columbus (Sunol)|Christopher Columbus]]''''' was donated to Central Park by the [[New York Genealogical and Biographical Society]] in commemoration of the 400th anniversary of his arrival in the Americas. The statue replicates one made by [[Jeronimo Suñol]] in 1892,&lt;ref&gt;The park's sculpture is signed in the bronze "J. SUÑOL"; it bears the foundry mark of Federico Masriera Barcelona 1892.&lt;/ref&gt; located at the Plaza de Colon, in [[Madrid]]. The New York version was placed in the park in 1894 at the foot of the Mall, and is today one of two monuments of Columbus found in the park's environs, the other being the statue surmounting the column at [[Columbus Circle]].  The sculpture depicts the explorer standing with outstretched arms, looking towards the heavens in gratitude for his successful voyage.
* The standing sculpture of [[Alexander Hamilton]] standing in a grove of apple trees and crabapples west of the East Drive behind the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] was "presented by [[John Church Hamilton|John C. Hamilton]] 1880", according to the inscription on its granite base. The donor was the son of Hamilton. It was sculpted by [[Carl Conrads]].
* The '''''[[King Jagiello Monument]]''''' is an equestrian statue of King '''[[Władysław II Jagiełło]]''' of [[History of Poland (1385&amp;ndash;1569)|Poland]], holding over his head two crossed swords, is the largest sculpture in Central Park.  As a result of the outbreak of the World War II, the monument stayed in New York; in July 1945 it was presented to the City of New York by the King Jagiello Monument Committee and permanently placed in Central Park with the cooperation of the last pre-Communist consul of Poland in New York, Kazimierz Krasicki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25777864?uid=3739704&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104328417543 |title=In the Footsteps of Stanislaw K.

* The bronze standing figure of '''''[[Daniel Webster (Ball)|Daniel Webster]]''''' by [[Thomas Ball (artist)|Thomas Ball]] stands on a high granite plinth at the confluence of two carriage drives near the foot of [[Strawberry Fields Memorial]], at approximately 72nd Street. Ball had circulated many examples of statuettes of this model. The over-lifesize bronze, cast in [[Munich]], was presented by Gordon W. Burnham in 1876. The plinth bears as a bronze legend Webster's famous phrases &lt;small&gt;LIBERTY AND UNION, NOW AND FOREVER, ONE AND INSEPARABLE. &lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/daniel-webster.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310224247/http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/daniel-webster.html |dead-url=no |archive-date=March 10, 2014 |publisher=Central Park Conservancy |title=Daniel Webster |accessdate=June 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientists===
* The bronze bust of naturalist '''[[Alexander von Humboldt]]''' by [[Gustav Blaeser]] (1813–1874) has stood since 1981 on a granite pedestal at Naturalists' Gate, 77th Street and [[Central Park West]], opposite the corner of the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. The monument, donated by an ad hoc association of German-Americans, the Humboldt Memorial Association, was dedicated at its original location at 59th Street and [[Fifth Avenue]] on September 14, 1869.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120207161415/http://www.centralpark2000.com/database/humbolt.html Central Park 2000: Alexander von Humboldt]; [http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=11943 NYC Dept of Parks &amp; Recreation: Alexander von Humboldt Monument]&lt;/ref&gt; Blaeser, who knew Humboldt, was said to have worked in part from Humboldt's death mask. The bronze was cast by [[Georg Ferdinand Howaldt]], Braunschweig.
* The '''[[J. Marion Sims (von Miller)|statue]]''' of [[Dr James Marion Sims]]

===War Memorials===
[[File:107th Rgt Memorial 5th Av cloudy jeh.jpg|right|thumb|''[[107th Infantry Memorial]]'']]
* The '''[[107th Infantry Memorial]]''' is dedicated to the men who served in the 107th New York Infantry Regiment, originally [[Seventh Regiment of New York]], during World War I. The regiment was, as its name implies, stationed in New York, and consisted of males mainly from this region. In 1917, the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]'s 7th New York Infantry Registry Division. While in France, they saw heavy action, and at the end of the war in November 1918, of the 3,700 men originally in the regiment, 580 men were killed and 1,487 wounded, with four of the regiment's soldiers being awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].  The memorial depicts seven men; the one to the far right carrying two [[Mills bomb]]s, while supporting the wounded soldier next to him. To his right another infantryman (depicting Robert Russell Bennett, a 107 combat veteran who was asked by the artist to model for the statue along with 6 other actual 107 veterans of the Somme) rushes towards the enemy positions, while the helmet less squad leader and another soldier are approaching the enemy with bayonets fixed. To the far left, one soldier is holding a mortally wounded soldier, keeping him on his feet. The [[bronze]] memorial was donated by 7th-107th Memorial Committee, and was designed and sculpted by [[Karl Illava]], who served in the 107th IR as a sergeant in World War I. The monument was first conceived about 1920, was made in 1926&amp;ndash;1927 and was placed in the park and unveiled in 1927, near the perimeter wall at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 67th Street.

===Writers and poets===
[[File:NYC Hans C Andersen.jpg|thumb|right|''Hans Christian Andersen'']]
* '''''[[Hans Christian Andersen]]''''', the famous Danish fairy-tale writer, his most notable work being "[[The Ugly Duckling]]". His statue features him sitting and reading to a stray duck. The 1956 work by sculptor [[Georg J. Lober]] was constructed with contributions from Danish and American schoolchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/hans-christian-andersen.html |title=Hans Christian Andersen |publisher=Central Park Conservancy |accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was cast at [[Modern Art Foundry]], Astoria, Queens, NY.
* Poet '''''[[Robert Burns (Steell)|Robert Burns]]''''' is sculpted in bronze by Sir [[John Steell]], the eminent Victorian sculptor.  It was unveiled in Central Park, New York in 1880. It was intended as a companion statue to '''''[[Sir Walter Scott (sculpture)|Sir Walter Scott]]''''' by the same sculptor, erected some eight years previously.
* '''''[[Fitz-Greene Halleck (sculpture)|Fitz-Greene Halleck]]''''' has been described as the ''least known literary figure today on Literary Walk'', despite being the only person to have a memorial unveiled by the then-[[president of the United States]], [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in 1877, ten years after his death in November 1867. The monument was funded by the use of public subscription, and had a long list of prominent guests and speakers at the dedication and unveiling of the monument, among them the president's cabinet, [[General of the Army]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T.Sherman]], the poets [[Bayard Taylor]], [[George Henry Boker]] and [[William Cullen Bryant]], as well as other notable citizens.  The monument is made in bronze by [[James Wilson Alexander MacDonald]], and is placed near the Literary Walk and The Mall. The monument has been thoroughly refurbished by The Central Park Conservancy, first by hot waxing it in 1983, and then again in 1992, as well as in 1999, when it was dewaxed, pressure-washed and repatinated, and then protected by a coating of a corrosion-inhibiting lacquer.
* '''''[[William Shakespeare (Ward)|William Shakespeare]]''''', a bronze statue on a stone pedestal, located to the south of the mall, southeast of Sheep's Meadow; this sculpture was erected with funds raised from a benefit performance of Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' on November 25, 1864, at [[The Winter Garden Theatre (1850)|The Winter Garden Theatre]], in a performance by [[Edwin Booth]], [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.]] and their younger brother, [[John Wilkes Booth]]. [[John Quincy Adams Ward]] sculpted the work. Ward was arguably the dean of American sculpture at the time, and he is the source of more public sculpture in NYC than any other artist. This is the artist's second of four works in Central Park.

===Other sculptures===
* ''The Angel of the Waters'' / '''[[Bethesda Fountain]]''' (unveiled in 1873) was not in the original "Greensward Plan", developed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]]; the architectural middle of the park was called "The Water Terrace", for its placement beside The Lake, but the area became known as Bethesda Terrace after the fountain was unveiled in 1873. At the unveiling ceremony, the artist's brochure quoted a Biblical verse from the Gospel of St. John: ''Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called… Bethesda…whoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.''  The fountain was designed and created by [[Emma Stebbins]], who became the first woman to receive a sculptural commission in New York City when she was commissioned to create this fountain. &lt;!-- CHECK It is one of the few monuments donated by NYC itself--&gt; It was designed and created in 1868, but wasn't unveiled until 1873, when the park was officially completed. In 1988. the [[Central Park Conservancy]] cleaned, repatinated, and sealed the fountain with a protective coating, and it is washed and waxed annually in order to preserve it. The fountain can be found in the middle of the park, on the north side of 72nd Street.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
* '''''[[Indian Hunter (sculpture)|Indian Hunter]]''''' (1866) by [[John Quincy Adams Ward]]&lt;ref&gt;Signed in the bronze "J.Q.A. WARD Sculptor N.Y. 1866"; it was also inscribed by the bronze-founder, L.A. Amouroux, New York&lt;/ref&gt; was shown at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1867]] and made the sculptor's reputation. It was the first sculpture by an American sculptor to be sited in Central Park, in 1869; it stands on the pathway west of The Mall, between the Mall and Sheep Meadow, at approximately 66th Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/indian-hunter.html |publisher=Central Park Conservancy |title=Indian Hunter |accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''''[[Untermyer Fountain]]''''' in [[Conservatory Garden]] was donated by the family of Samuel Untermyer in 1947. The bronze figures, ''Three Dancing Maidens'' by [[Walter Schott]] (1861–1938), were executed in Germany about 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/untermyer-fountain.html |title=The Untermyer Fountain |publisher=Central Park Conservancy |accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, temporary exhibitions of sculpture are mounted in the Doris Freedman Plaza, a concrete and cobblestone area located just outside the southeast entrance walkway to the park, behind the Sherman Monument.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

'''Louis-François, Baron Lejeune''' (3 February 1775 in [[Strasbourg]] – 29 February 1848) was a [[France|French]] [[general]], [[Painting|painter]], and [[lithographer]]. His memoirs have frequently been republished and his name is engraved on the [[Arc de Triomphe]].

==Life==
He studied painting in the studio of [[Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes]], alongside [[Jean-Victor Bertin]], but left the studio to volunteer in the [[Compagnie des arts de Paris]] in 1792. He received his baptism of fire in the [[battle of Valmy]] later that year. He became a sergeant in the 1st Arsenal battalion and in 1793 moved to the artillery at [[La Fère]], assisting in the sieges of [[Landrecies]], [[Le Quesnoy]] and [[Valenciennes]]. At Valenciennes he became [[aide-de-camp]] to general Jacob then, as a lieutenant on attachment to the engineers, took part in the 1794 Holland campaign and the 1795 campaign.

Called to the depot in 1798, he succeeded brilliantly in his exams and was made a captain on attachment to the engineers. He became aide-de-camp to Marshal [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]] in 1800, a post he retained until 1812 and in which he took an active part in practically all of the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic campaigns]]. He was wounded and captured in [[Peninsular War|Spain]]. He was promoted to full captain after [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]] and chef de bataillon after [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], also becoming a knight of the [[Légion d'honneur]] and a colonel at the [[Second Siege of Zaragoza|Siege of Saragossa]].

The German campaign of 1806 brought him to [[Munich]], where he visited the workshop of [[Alois Senefelder]], the inventor of [[lithography]]. Lejeune was fascinated by the possibilities of the new method and whilst there he made the drawing on stone of his famous [[Cossack]] (printed by C. and ~f. Senefelder, 1806). Whilst he was taking his dinner, and with his horses harnessed and waiting to take him back to Paris, one hundred proofs were printed, one of which he subsequently submitted to Napoleon. The introduction of lithography into France was greatly due to the efforts of Lejeune.

In 1812, during the French invasion of Russia, he was made [[général de brigade]] and chief of staff to [[Louis Nicolas Davout|Davout]]. Frostbitten on the face, Lejeune left his post during the retreat from Russia and was arrested on the orders of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. Freed in March 1813, Lejeune was then sent to the Illyrian provinces, before rejoining the army under the orders of marshal [[Nicolas Charles Oudinot|Oudinot]], becoming his chief of staff. During the Saxony campaign, Lejeune was present at the [[Battle of Lutzen (1813)]], the crossing of the [[River Spree]] and at [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]]. He was made an officer of the Légion d'honneur and a commander of the [[Order of Maximilian of Bavaria]]. At the battle of Hoyersverda, when [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bülow von Dennewitz|Bülow]]'s corps wiped out the 12th corps formed up in square on the plain, Lejeune (at risk of being kidnapped) ventured into the enemy lines with one battalion, general Wolf's cavalry and six 12 pounder guns. He thus broke the whole of the Prussian artillery and saved marshal Oudinot and his army. Wounded several times and lastly at [[Battle of Hanau|Hanau]], he was authorised to leave the army in November 1813 after more than 20 years' service. After his departure from the army, he devoted himself to painting.

After an initial grant in [[Hanover]] in 1808, and a second in [[Westphalia]] in 1810, he was made a [[Nobility of the First French Empire|baron d'Empire]] in 1810. Already a member of the cross of the [[Order of Leopold (Austria)|Order of Leopold]], Lejeune was made a [[knight of St Louis]] by [[Louis XVIII]] and in 1823 a commander of the Légion d'honneur. He returned to the army (now under the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbons]]) from 1818 to 1824, becoming commander of [[Haute-Garonne]] in 1831. On 2 September 1821 he married Louise Clary, sister of general Marius Clary and niece of [[Désirée Clary]], queen of Sweden by her marriage with [[Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]]. In 1824 the king of Sweden conferred on Lejeune the grand-cross of the [[Order of the Sword]]. In 1837 he became director of the École des beaux-arts et de l’industrie in [[Toulouse]], a city of which he became mayor in 1841 and in which he died of a heart attack aged 73.

==Works==
[[File:Louis-François Baron Lejeune 001.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[battle of the Pyramids]], by Lejeune]]
He produced an important series of battle-pictures based on his experiences. He had kept his paintbrushes with him on the battlefield and the popularity he enjoyed was due to the truth and vigour of his work, which was generally executed from sketches and studies made on the battlefield. His works are known for their lofty perspective' "offering a panoramic view of the totality of the battle's events." &lt;ref&gt;The Art of War[s] - Chase Maenius&lt;/ref&gt; When his battle-pictures were shown at the [[Egyptian Hall]] in [[London]], a rail had to be put up to protect them from the eager crowds of sightseers. He is best known for his paintings of the [[battle of Guirando]], which appeared in 1819 to enormous success, and of the [[battle of Borodino]], his masterwork. Many of his battle-pictures were engraved by [[Jacques Joseph Coiny]] and [[Edme Bovinet]]. He also produced several studies of uniforms in the French Imperial Army, such as those of the lancers of [[Grand Duchy of Berg|Berg]] under [[Joachim Murat|Murat]] and of Berthier's aides-de-camp.

Among his chief works are ''The Entry of Charles X. into Paris, 6 June 1825'' at Versailles; ''Episode of the Prussian War, October 1807'' at [[Douai Museum]]; ''Marengo (1801)''; ''Lodi, Thabor, Aboukir'' (1804); ''The Pyramids'' (1806); ''Passage of the Rhine in 1795'' (1824), and ''Moskawa'' (??).

==Career==
In her childhood, Percovich already liked the theater through the influence of her parents, who helped her to be a "conscious spectator", although she had decided not to be an actress. Before starting her theatrical career, she worked as a {{ill|Cultural journalism|es|Periodismo cultural|lt=cultural journalist}} in different media, such as at the weekly magazine ''[[Búsqueda (Uruguay)|Búsqueda]]'', where she held the post of editor of the culture section, and also as a literature teacher at different theater schools.

Her first contact with theater direction was due to the support of director [[Carlos Aguilera (theater director)|Carlos Aguilera]], who allowed her to be his assistant on all the rehearsals of his play ''Ya nadie recuerda a Frederick Chopin'' in 1982, when she was 19 years old.&lt;ref name=pelee/&gt;

Due to the lack of training offers for theater directors, Percovich worked under the tutelage of Carlos Aguilera, as well as directors [[Héctor Manuel Vidal]], Jorge Curi, and {{ill|Eduardo Schinca|es}}, and also her father, who "made us look at architecture. From a very young age, he {{em|obligated}} me to be very observant of my city."&lt;ref name=pelee/&gt;

She continued her training in Europe when she received a scholarship to the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in London, where she had as tutors [[Steven Berkoff]] and [[Stephen Daldry]], among others. She was also at the {{ill|Théâtre Ouvert|fr}} in Paris, where she was a resident.&lt;ref name=pelee/&gt;

In 2004 she began her first term as director of the Municipal School of Dramatic Arts (EMAD), which lasted until 2007, when she resigned her position due to professional differences with teachers of the school.&lt;ref name=pelee/&gt; Later she was Coordinator of Performing Arts of the Ministry of Education and Culture of Uruguay, where she worked under the direction of the poet and essayist [[Hugo Achugar]], National Director of Culture.&lt;ref name=nueva/&gt;

In 2007 Percovich joined the company Complot with playwright and theater director Gabriel Calderón, choreographer Martín Inthamoussú, and actor and theater director Ramiro Perdomo.&lt;ref name=Dramaturgia/&gt;&lt;ref name=Complot&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ciacomplot.com/lacompania.html |title=La Compañia |publisher=Complot |language=Spanish |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928073210/http://www.ciacomplot.com/lacompania.html |archive-date=28 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |access-date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first production with the new company was ''Una lluvia irlandesa'', by the Majorcan author Josep Pere-Peyró.&lt;ref name=Solís&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.teatrosolis.org.uy/uc_2174_1.html |title=Una obra de Mariana Percovich por el grupo canadiense Singulier Pluriel |trans-title=A Work By Mariana Percovich By the Canadian Group Singulier Pluriel |publisher=[[Solís Theatre]] |language=Spanish |access-date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 she again took up management of EMAD,&lt;ref name=vuelve/&gt;&lt;ref name=nueva/&gt; where her new project was the reformation of the school's curriculum to raise its degrees to the level of [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]].&lt;ref name=pelee/&gt; She remained in the position until 2014.&lt;ref name=bambalinas&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://ladiaria.com.uy/articulo/2016/6/tras-bambalinas/ |title=Tras bambalinas |trans-title=Backstage |last=Quiring |first=Débora |work=La Diaria |language=Spanish |date=23 June 2016 |access-date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since July 2015, she has been the Director of Culture of the {{ill|Departmental Intendency of Montevideo|es|Intendencia Departamental de Montevideo}}.&lt;ref name=bambalinas/&gt;&lt;ref name=EMAD&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://emad.edu.uy/escuela/estructura.html |title=Estructura |trans-title=Structure |language=Spanish |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618232057/http://emad.edu.uy/escuela/estructura.html |archive-date=18 June 2015 |dead-url=yes |access-date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Percovich's direction style has been highlighted by "a scenic investigation of the relationship between the viewer and the space", which has led her to mount her works both in conventional halls and in unusual places, such as public or historical buildings, bars, stables, and train stations.&lt;ref name=FIBA/&gt;

She expressed this style from her first work, 1995's ''Te casarás en América'', which was presented at the Hungarian Synagogue in Montevideo.&lt;ref name=pelee/&gt; Her intention since then has been the search for new languages generated by "the aura and the symbols that emerge from those places" to interact with their infrastructure and give them a new meaning that serves as a challenge for the viewer.&lt;ref name=pelee/&gt;

In 1990s, her style was influenced by a play by Antonio Araujo, who was followed by the public while he performed his work in the corridors and stairs of the abandoned hospital "Umberto Primo" in [[São Paulo]], Brazil.&lt;ref name=pelee/&gt; This form of representation was subsequently used in her works ''Destino de dos cosas o de tres'', ''Juego de damas crueles'', ''El errante de Nod'', and ''Pentesilea''.&lt;ref name=pelee/&gt;

Percovich was inspired by her colleague Roberto Bartís to define her way of seeing the acting work and thus transmit it to the actors who work with her:

{{Quote|An actor is a gesture thief to the extent that he has to take reality as a model, and he is also part of that reality. But it is very important that he have an opinion. I do not believe in the actor repeating from a text. We no longer bet on "talking heads". An actor is a person with soul, heart, and technique, but also opinion. From the reality that I have as a model, I select what I take. [...] When you go to see a character, in reality you will see So-and-so playing that character. Otherwise, what would be the point of seeing Hamlet again?|source=Mariana Percovich, March 2012&lt;ref name=pelee/&gt;}}

''Juego de damas crueles'' has been Percovich's most awarded play. For it, she received the Florencio Award twice – one for best show and the other for best director.&lt;ref name=pelee/&gt;

Proyecto Feria was a [[street theatre]] project created by Percovich in response to an invitation from the [[Mercosur]] International Festival of [[Córdoba, Argentina]], which was carried out at the different [[Flea market|fairs]] of the city. For its execution, Percovich chose two models of fair: one of freaks and one conventional. The project represented for her the culmination of a six-year search for the integration of art with the national identity. After its presentation in Córdoba, the project was carried out in [[Montevideo]] a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.revistatodavia.com.ar/todavia24/3.pacheconota.html |title=Proyecto Feria: contadores de historias entre frutas y verduras |trans-title=Proyecto Feria: Storytellers Among Fruits and Vegetables |last=Pacheco |first=Carlos |work=Revista Todavía |number=3 |language=Spanish |date=December 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704073412/http://www.revistatodavia.com.ar/todavia24/3.pacheconota.html |archive-date=4 July 2013 |dead-url=yes |access-date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Percovich's presentations in Montevideo, her plays have also been shown in Santiago, Buenos Aires, Córdoba, São Paulo, Curitiba, Barcelona, Madrid, London, and Nuevo León (Mexico), among other cities.&lt;ref name=Solís/&gt; As a teacher, she has developed a national and international career in direction and acting.

'''Marimekko''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] home furnishings, textiles, and fashion company based in [[Helsinki]]. It made important contributions to [[fashion]] in the 1960s. It is particularly noted for its brightly colored printed fabrics and simple styles, used both in women's garments and in home furnishings.

Two designers in particular, [[Vuokko Nurmesniemi]], with bold stripes, and [[Maija Isola]], with large simple flowered prints such as the '''''Unikko''''' [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]], created hundreds of distinctive patterns and helped to make Marimekko a household name across the world.

==History==
=== Foundation ===
[[File:Armi-Ratia-1959.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Finnish entrepreneur [[Armi Ratia]] (1912–1979), founder of Marimekko.]] 
[[File:Marianne Aav Marimekko low-res Cover.jpg|thumb|236px|Marianne Aav's book on Marimekko has [[Maija Isola]]'s iconic 1964 ''Unikko'' [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] print as its background]]
[[File:11-07-29-helsinki-by-RalfR-054.jpg|thumb|236px|A Marimekko store in Kamppi, Helsinki]]

Marimekko was founded in 1951 by Viljo and [[Armi Ratia]], after the Viljo's oil-cloth factory project failed and was converted to a garment plant. Armi asked some artist friends to apply their [[graphic design]]s to textiles.  To show how the fabric could be used, the company then designed and sold a line of simple dresses using their fabric.  When Finland's leading [[industrial design]]er [[Timo Sarpaneva]] invited the company to present a [[fashion show]] (albeit canceled at short notice) at the 1957 [[Triennale]] in [[Milan]], this was an early recognition of fashion as an industrial art and of Marimekko's key role in the process. The garments were eventually showcased in the nearby [[La Rinascente|Rinascente]] upscale department store by display manager [[Giorgio Armani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1 = Kaj Kalin | author2 = [[Timo Sarpaneva]] | author3 = Marjatta Svennevig | title = Sarpaneva | publisher = Otava | year = 1986 | location = Helsinki | isbn = 951-1-07887-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pioneering design ===
Two pioneering designers set the tone for Marimekko: [[Vuokko Nurmesniemi]] in the 1950s and [[Maija Isola]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Kristina Isola, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marnie Fogg, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Nurmesniemi designed the simply striped red and white ''Jokapoika'' shirt in 1956. Isola designed the iconic ''Unikko'' ([[Poppy (flower)|poppy]]) print pattern in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marimekko.com/who-we-are/timeline Marimekko Timeline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027094510/http://www.marimekko.com/who-we-are/timeline |date=2011-10-27 }}  Retrieved 30 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Marimekko's bold fabrics and bright, simple design strongly influenced late 20th-century taste.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Jackson, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the early Marimekko designs, including Isola's ''Unikko'', remain in production in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marimekko.com/products Marimekko Products (in 2011)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009103335/http://www.marimekko.com/products |date=2011-10-09 }} Retrieved 30 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finnishdesign.com/finnish-design-companies/marimekko|title=Marimekko - Finnish Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commercial growth ===
Marimekko spread to America in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lange, Alexandra |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/jane-jacobs-georgia-okeeffe-and-the-power-of-the-marimekko-dress |title=Jane Jacobs, Georgia O’Keeffe, and the Power of the Marimekko Dress |work=The New Yorker |date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced to the [[United States]] by the architect [[Benjamin C. Thompson]], who featured them in his [[Design Research (store)|Design Research stores]]. They were made famous in the United States by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]], who bought eight Marimekko dresses which she wore throughout the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 United States presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/house-and-homes-blog/2011/sep/20/marimekko-textile-design | title=The Guardian House and Home Blog | publisher=The Guardian | work=Marimekko's bid for world domination | date=20 September 2011 | accessdate=October 30, 2011 | author=Qureshi, Huma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1965, the company employed over 400 staff, and the company was in every aspect of fine design, from fabrics to toys and dinnerware. The firm even completely equipped small houses with furnishings. In 1985, the company was sold to [[Amer Sports|Amer-yhtymä]]. In the early 1990s, Marimekko was in a bad financial condition and close to bankruptcy. It was bought from Amer by Kirsti Paakkanen, who introduced new business methods in the company and helped to revive its popularity.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;

Later in the 1990s Marimekko achieved publicity in the hit TV series ''[[Sex and the City]]''. The fictional main character of the series, sex-and-relationship columnist [[Carrie Bradshaw]], wore a Marimekko bikini on [[List of Sex and the City episodes#Season 2 (1999)|season&amp;nbsp;2]] and then a Marimekko dress. In [[List of Sex and the City episodes#Season 5 (2002)|season&amp;nbsp;5]] the series introduced tablecloths with Marimekko prints.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;

In 2005, Marimekko's revenue had quadrupled since Paakkanen's purchase, and its net income had grown 200-fold. Paakkanen remained CEO of Marimekko and owned 20% of the company via her business Workidea. In 2007, Paakkanen announced she would gradually hand over her ownership to Mika Ihamuotila as CEO and biggest owner of the company. As of 2011, there are stores in [[New York City]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]; [[Oxford, Mississippi]]; [[Miami, Florida]]; and [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marimekko.com/shops/shop-locator?country=us&amp;city=&amp;tid=92&amp;nid= "Marimekko Shop Locator"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424031718/http://www.marimekko.com/shops/shop-locator?country=us&amp;city=&amp;tid=92&amp;nid= |date=2012-04-24 }} Retrieved 30 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2011 there were 84 stores across the world.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt; Marikmekko products are (2017) made in China, India, Thailand and other countries. Fabrics are still printed in Marimekko's textile factory in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marimekko.com/se_en/the-brand/printed-in-helsinki |title=Printed in Helsinki - About Marikmekko |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logo ==
The logo of Marimekko has been in use since 1954. Armi Ratia wanted the logo to be simple and timeless. Graphic designer Helge Mether-Borgström used modified versions of classic [[Olivetti]] [[typewriter]] letters to create the logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History – Marimekko as a company|url=https://company.marimekko.com/en/about-marimekko/history/|website=Marimekko|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marimekko chart ==
The Marimekko name has been adopted within business and the [[management consultancy]] industry to refer to a specific type of [[bar chart]] known as a variable-width chart or [[Mosaic plot]] in which all the bars are of equal height, there are no spaces between the bars, and the bars are in turn each divided into segments of different width. The design of the mosaic plot resembles a Marimekko print.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mekkographics.com/resources/charts-by-type/marimekko/ "Mekkographics.com"]&lt;/ref&gt; The chart's design encodes two variables (such as percentage of sales and market share), but it is criticised for making the data hard to perceive and to compare visually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perceptualedge.com/example13.php "Example Marimekko Chart"], Retrieved 30 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Marimekko has a sister chart called the Bar Mekko in which the bars are of variable height and width.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mekkographics.com/resources/charts-by-type/bar-mekko/ "Mekkographics.com"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Cindy Babski wrote in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that "There was never any doubt about what the inside label would say. The clothes and fabrics, with their striking design and splashes of bold color, were clearly Marimekko. But for people of a certain generation—those who came of age in the 1960's—they represented more than just a brand name: They conjured up an image and an era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/03/business/marimekko-changes-its-spots.html?src=pm | title=Marimekko Changes Its Spots | work =New York Times | date= January 3, 1988 | author= Cindy Babski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Heidi Avellan wrote in the Swedish newspaper ''[[Sydsvenskan]]'' that Marimekko was no longer a "statement, just as T-shirts with revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] or [[Keffiyeh|Palestinian scarves]] rarely express any political awareness. Marimekko is paper napkins and rubber boots". She wrote that Marimekko "began with the colourfully striped shirt, ''Jokapoika'' which Vuokko Nurmesniemi designed in 1956", which became the symbol for new radicalism in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.sydsvenskan.se/opinion/heidi-avellan/radikala-rander | title=Radikala ränder (Radical stripes) | work =Sydsvenskan | date=5 August 2007 | accessdate=5 October 2012 | author=HeidiAvellan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''museum in progress''' is a private [[art association]] based in [[Vienna]]. The non-profit art initiative was created in 1990 by [[Kathrin Messner]] and [[Josef Ortner]] († 2009) with the aim to develop new presentation forms for contemporary art. The projects are implemented in each case on the basis of co-operation between economy, art and media.

== Exhibition activity ==
The exhibition activity of museum in progress concentrates on media and public spaces. For example, newspapers, magazines, billboards, building fronts, television and internet are used. The works of art exhibited by museum in progress are specifically created for the medium, dependent on the context and temporary.

This working technique enables museum in progress to overcome the distance between everyday life and places of art as well as to reach a far larger public than traditional museums.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Tobias Wall: Das unmögliche Museum. Zum Verhältnis von Kunst und Kunstmuseen der Gegenwart, Bielefeld: transcript, 2006, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''My Life in Court''''' is a 1961 memoir by American trial lawyer [[Louis Nizer]] documenting his career in law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/11/obituaries/louis-nizer-lawyer-to-the-famous-dies-at-92.html|title=Louis Nizer, Lawyer to the Famous, Dies at 92|last=Pace|first=Eric|date=November 11, 1994|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was a best seller when it was first released, lasting for 72 weeks on ''The New York Times'' Bestsellers list.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
The book is based on a number of court cases that Nizer argued in US courts. The original papers for many of these trials are held by the Columbia Law Library.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mcir.usc.edu/cases/1940-1949/Pages/baronfeist.html|title=Music Copyright Infringement Resource – Sponsored By USC Gould School of Law|website=mcir.usc.edu|access-date=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite archive|collection=Louis Nizer Papers, 1940–1994|institution=Columbia Librarias Rare Book and Manuscript Library Collections|box=[http://findingaids.cul.columbia.edu/ead/nnc-rb/ldpd_10203548/dsc/3/ Biographical Materials &amp; My Life in Court]|Series=Writings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
All six cases depicted within the book are civil cases, which is unusual for legal fiction and non-fiction because of the greater sensationality of criminal law cases.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/louis-nizer-5/my-life-in-court/|title=My Life in Court by Louis Nizer|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Kirkus Reviews|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book depicts the following cases:

==Reception==
The book was received favorably. ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine reviewer David T. Bazelon said he did not "understand why it has become a bestseller", but all in all "Properly read, it is an occasion for some real understanding of the trial man.  Haphazardly or naively read, it is interesting, instructive, and even exciting."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/my-life-in-court-by-louis-nizer/|title=My Life in Court, by Louis Nizer|last=Bazelon|first=David T.|date=July 1, 1962|website=Commentary Magazine|publisher=|access-date=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bazelon challenges praise by [[Max Lerner]] that the work is "one of the great legal autobiographies of our time".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kirkus reviews gave less praise, calling the book "direct and orderly" and enjoyable by "Trial lawyers, law students, and the general public".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

For the most part, academic and legal reviewers of the autobiography were particularly harsh critics of the book. In ''The Modern Law Review,'' British reviewer C.P. Harvey commented "I cannot help wondering what made Messrs. Heinmann think it would be good business to publish this book in [the United Kingdom]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=C. P.|date=January 1, 1963|title=Review of My Life in Court|jstor=1093319|journal=The Modern Law Review|volume=26|issue=2|pages=215–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He writes "I pronounce this book to be didactic, long-winded and pretentious" and describes it as an example of "the breadth of the ocean which lies between the English and American legal systems."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the ''[[Osgoode Hall Law Journal]]'', reviewer R. N. Starr described the work as not exactly realistic, and taken to "poetic license".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Starr|first=R. N.|date=April 1963|title=Book Review: My Life in Court, by Louis Nizer|url=http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2485&amp;context=ohlj|journal=Osgoode Hall Law Journal|volume=2|issue=4 |access-date=|via=York University Digital Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His review is rather skeptical and mixed; he writes: "For my own part I would have preferred it, had Mr. Nizer put his wide experience to other purposes."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In the ''Yale Law Review'' Joseph W. Bishop lambasts the piece as demonstrating the decline of legal practice, jury tried cases, and the flaws of the legal profession.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Nonetheless, he describes the book as anything but "dry and indigestable reading" which is usually the case for accounts of legal cases.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Unlike other academic reviewers, ''American Bar Association Journal'' reviewer [[Alfred Schweppe]] praised the book as a "''must'' for every lawyer searching for an answer to success in the courtroom" and the describing the style as "Moving with an easy finished prose".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
The book has inspired a number of people to become lawyers, including [[Laurie Levenson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/gerry-spence-and-his-fight-against-power/#!|title=Gerry Spence and His Fight Against Power – Los Angeles Review of Books|language=en-US|access-date=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Roy Black (attorney)|Roy Black]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WARD|first=STEPHANIE FRANCIS|date=January 1, 2011|title=30/30: 30 LAWYERS PICK 30 BOOKS EVERY LAWYER SHOULD READ|jstor=23034037|journal=ABA Journal|volume=97|issue=8|pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nizer's subsequent book ''[[The Jury Returns]]'' follows much the same format and pattern as ''My Life in Court'', attempting to create a similar work and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meserve|first=Robert W.|date=January 1, 1967|title=Review of THE JURY RETURNS|jstor=25724089|journal=American Bar Association Journal|volume=53|issue=7|pages=648–649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adaptations ===
The book was adapted into the 1963 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play ''[[A Case of Libel]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The book was also adapted into a television film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phillipsnizer.com/publications/articles/TenThingsBerger04_art.cfm|title=Ten Things I Learned From Louis Nizer – Phillips Nizer LLP Articles|last=Berger|first=George|date=|website=www.phillipsnizer.com|publisher=|access-date=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both depict the ''[[Reynolds v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15548">'''The New Rochelle Art Association''' ('''NRAA''') was founded in 1912 by artists and residents of the city of [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] in [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/New-Rochelle-Art-Association/106863242721169?sk=info&amp;tab=page_info NRAA Facebook Bio]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1912 the community had transformed into a true [[New Rochelle artist colony|”artists colony”]], home to many notable artists of the time including  [[Frederic Remington]],  AIta West Salisbury, [[Edward Kemble]],  Rufus Fairchild Zogbaurn, [[Orson Lowell]], F. Wellingon Ruckstuhl, Ernest Albert, Homer Emons, [[Frederick Dana Marsh]], [[Remington Schuyler]], Lucius Wolcott Hitchcock, [[George T.

==Founding==
For years there had been informal meetings in the studios of various artists, often with guests invited out from New York City. In 1912, however, Alta Salisbury West proposed that a more formal group be formed – the New Rochelle Art Association. The original group of artists included Charles F. Ayer, Frederick Dana Marsh, Remington Schuyler, Herman Lambden, George T. Tobin, Armand Booth, Leon Schafer, Lucius Hitchcock and Orson Lowell. Mrs. West became the first president. The Art Association produced its first public exhibition in 1914 as part of the celebrations surrounding the opening of the new Carnegie Public Library on Main Street which included both a large and small public exhibition room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nraaonline.org/ NRAA website]&lt;/ref&gt; This exhibition, organized under the auspices of the Art Section of the Woman's Club of New Rochelle, was the first exhibition of the New Rochelle Art Association. There were 140 juried entries of paintings and sculpture, including a painting by Frederic Remington and an outstanding bronze bust of Augustus Thomas by Robert Aitken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/new-rochelle-art-association-records-8088 Smithsonian Archives of American Art: New Rochelle Art Association records, 1914–1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

That exhibition was just the first of many at the library. The members of the Art Association continued to use the library to show their work. There were both group shows, generally featuring a particular media, and ones featuring various individual artists. Shows in the first few years included one devoted to the work of Frederick Dana Marsh and one to Milton Mayer, and a group show of the Association of Women Painters and Sculptors of New York City.

==Organization==
On January 4, 1920, a notice appeared on the bottom of New Rochelle's Evening Standard advertising the annual meeting of all members of the NRAA at the home of Orson Lowell. This was the meeting where the Art Association was formally organized and its aims set forth. Its stated plan was to cooperate with the Community Service which was promoting education, literacy and civic betterment programs in New Rochelle. By holding regular exhibitions of the highest quality, the Association planned to set an educational standard in the Fine Arts, and in other ways to promote public interest in art in the community. There were three classes of membership: active, associate, and patron. The Association was divided into four sections, each with a chairman and secretary, who had representation on the central board composed of the officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/new-rochelle-art-association-records-8088 Smithsonian Archives of American Art: New Rochelle Art Association records, 1914–1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Board===

* Vice President: Orson Lowell 
* Second Vice President: Julius Prince
* Secretary: Elizabeth Ayer
* Treasurer: E. Irvins Hanson

===Sections of the NRAA===

There were no known written by-laws of the Association until 1929, when, under the laws of the State of New York, the New Rochelle Art Association was required to develop its own constitution and by-laws for a membership corporation. In the early l930's the Constitution and By-Laws were updated to again meet State requirements, this time for a non-profit membership corporation.

==Exhibitions==
In 1920, after the Association had been organized into its four main Sections, the 'Fine Arts Room' of the Library was acquired for the groups use. The first exhibition was put on by the 'Illustrators Section' and 57 paintings in every medium were displayed.  The following year the exhibit included the [[Knickerbocker Building (New Rochelle, New York)|Knickerbocker Press]] and [[Knickerbocker Building (New Rochelle, New York)|The Little Print Press]], both of New Rochelle, and showed the various processes used to make books. The 'Painters Section' soon followed with their own exhibit, followed by the 'Cartoonists'. Next there was the "Little Picture Show" and the "Sketch Exhibit" which both became annual events.

Finally the 'Architects Section' mounted their exhibition. It wasn't until this show that brought together the work of a number of city architects that the community finally realized how many talented artists and masters of their profession actually resided in New Rochelle. Three medals were awarded at the exhibit including; Best Designed Residence - Phillip J. Rocker; Best Designed Commercial Building - Laurence M. Loeb; and the Best Rendering - George Licht.

The variety of shows was amazing. Kenneth Clark exhibited a number of his photographs and Henry Bultitude exhibited his miniature rooms creations. The graphic arts fueled continued interest, and drawings, illustrations, posters, wood and linoleum cuts, etchings, monotypes' and lithographic prints were shown.

During the 1920s the New Rochelle Art Association continued to exhibit regularly. There were so many members that each show tended to be devoted to subsets of the membership. There were shows for illustrations, for painting and sculpture, for drawings and graphic arts, architecture and one devoted to arts and crafts. In between the group shows, smaller shows were held featuring a particular artist, or a particular medium. Many shows also featured a lecture related to the theme of the show. The organization often operated as a museum for the city. A show in November 1921, for example, featured paintings and sculptures loaned by local patrons.  It was considered significant enough that ''[[The New York Times]]'' covered the show saying, “About $50,000 has emerged from the private collections of the locality”. The show included four examples of work by [[Winslow Homer]].
  
In 1925 the Association organized a poster exhibition which included posters that had been part of a lawsuit in England. These were a series of posters  featuring scenes from the British colonies done by  Captain Spenser Pryse for the British Empire Exhibition,  but had been rejected because some of the  subjects were too scantily clad.

In 1925, the Association lost one of their notable illustrators - Edward Penfield. A Memorial Exhibition was held in his honor. He was considered the “originator of the poster in America” and for six years designed all the posters for ''Harper’s Magazine''.  Many examples of his work were displayed.

While, for the most part, the work that appeared in the shows seems to have been somewhat conservative in style, the members of the association were aware of current movements. They went out of their way to look for examples of work from overseas, and shows might include work by artists from London or Munich or Scandinavia. A 1926 show included work by Reginald Marsh. In 1927 they even hosted a show billed as a “Modern Show”. The following year they had a special section of the display area where they put “the more modern trend of paintings.” A 1928 show garnered a full page spread in the local paper with photos of many of the artists and their art. This show was also covered in ''The New York Times'' and was so popular that special trains ran out from New York City so that students could attend the show. Exhibitors included some of the stars of the illustration world including Ernest Watson, Federick R. Gruger, Franklin Booth and Percy Crosby, as well as Frederick Dana Marsh, Courtney Allen, George T. Tobin,  Donald Teague, Leslie Zauner, J. C. Leyendecker,  Dean Cornwall, Water B. Humphrey, Orson Lowell,  Norman Rockwell, Revere Wistehuff, George  Brehm, Charles Williams, Robert W. Stewart, C. J.  Munro and Harold Anderson.

In the early 1950s, the First National Bank of New Rochelle opened its doors to the NRAA to exhibit paintings and sculpture.  Fifteen years later the same bank, but under the name of the First Westchester National Bank, allowed the Association to use its facilities for a juried Sculpture and Ceramics Forms Exhibition. This type of show was the first of its kind.
 
In 1963, all the first-place winners from a year's worth of shows displayed their work together at the Ruth White gallery on 57th Street in New York City to generally favorable reviews.

The saddest exhibitions were the Memorial Tributes which were mounted shortly after a member's death. These were started in 1924 upon the passing of Frank X. Leyendecker. His Memorial exhibition drew large crowds from the fields of art, opera, publishing and stage. Six more memorials were held, from 1924 to 1934, for Clare Briggs, Edward Penfield, Coles Phillips, C.J. Munro, and Kenneth Clark.

==Approach signs==
In 1921, the New Rochelle Art Association conceived the idea of creating more interesting signs for the major approach roads to New Rochelle. In April of that year a model of one of the signs was displayed at the New Rochelle Trust company and in 1922 the City Council approved their construction.  James Marsh, a member of the Art Association and a metal craftsman, wrought the signs by hand his studio from the designs and were given as a gift to the City from the NRAA. Ten of the twelve signs were completed in 1923 and were mounted on the cement stanchions at the main approach roads into the City. Each of the signs had a cutout design on the top and, hanging below on brackets, a separate sign made of iron that carried out the artist's motif with an inscription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newrochellearts.org/content.php?nID=2&amp;cID=4 Signs of the Past]&lt;/ref&gt;

The signs include: "Stage Coach Days" - Edward Penfield; "Landing of the Huguenots" - George T. Tobin; "When A Feller Needs A Friend" - Clare Briggs; "Indians Returning From The Deer Hunt" - Remington Schuyler; "  of La Rochelle" - James Marsh, son of Frederick Dana Marsh designed "The Huguenot Ship"; "The City Of Homes" - Ralph T. Robertson; "Passing Of The British" - by Coles Phillips; "Rich In History" -  Norman Rockwell; and "City Of Homes, Churches, and Schools" - Laurence M. Loeb. The lettering on this last sign was changed later to read "City Of Homes, Houses of Worship and Schools". Walter Beach Humphrey and Lucius Hitchcock were other designers that contributed to this project. The signs caused a major sensation and were given national press coverage, and were copied in other communities across the country.

==Art schools==
According to Lucius Hitchcock, President of the NRAA in 1924, New Rochelle was not only the most affluent city in New York State, but had more artists per capita than almost any city in the U.S. To capitalize on both of these, the Art Association felt the time had come to sponsor an art school here, and would direct its policies and hire its teachers. At the beginning, the proposed New Rochelle Art School would afford opportunities for study to young men and women, although children and classes might also be established, including evening classes. The school was also give what would amount to collegiate work in architecture.  The NRAA artists would receive no pay for their work and would do everything in connection with the school except assume financial responsibility. Their hope was to have the City fund this endeavor and they felt the best way to do this was through the Board of Education. According to a letter to the Board of Education, the plan was to charge tuition at New York Art School rates, of about $30 per week, to the students and, in return for the financial support given by the Board of Education, the school would offer free scholarships to public school pupils. The Association reserved the right to terminate the scholarship without recourse if the student failed in effort or disclosed what was judged to be a lack of appreciation of his opportunities. After much deliberation, the Board of Education turned them down. They reasoned that using taxpayer's money to maintain a school for the benefit of a few talented pupils was too narrow a focus.

Twenty four years later a group of four NRAA artists established an art school. This time a private school named “The Huguenot School of Art” opened its doors at 352 North Avenue.  It was an evening school so as to accommodate those individuals with a major interest in art who had to hold down full-time jobs. Its founders made up the faculty, with each having his area of expertise. The purpose of the school was to provide a carefully selected course of studies to develop sound training in drawing, painting, and creative composition as the foundation for an active career in the field of art. The curriculum consisted of basic, intermediate and advanced courses with Saturday classes for children. These were too progressively arranged so that the student would have the opportunity to explore the possibilities of many graphic media, and to present every constructive trend in the conservative and modern schools of art expression. For four years this school was an important element in the art world of the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/new-rochelle-art-association-records-8088 Smithsonian Archives of American Art: New Rochelle Art Association records, 1914–1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1752">'''On air on sale''' is a policy in the [[music industry]] where [[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded music]] is made available for sale at the same time as it is made available for radio broadcast, instead of several weeks later in order to let marketing "buzz" develop, as was former practice.

A relatively new development, it is controversial within the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=1043929|title=UK Government gets behind on air/on sale|publisher=Music Week|date=January 18, 2011|author=Robert Ashton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/13086221|title=Chipmunk: On Air On Sale 'unfair'|work=[[BBC Newsbeat]]|date=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]] announced that it will be dropping its on air on sale strategy in the United Kingdom. The strategy was put into practice early this year by both Sony and [[Universal Music|Universal]] in the UK, but has been largely abandoned in favor of "looking at each release on a case-by-case basis," according to a statement from Sony. Singles by Lady Gaga, [[Jessie J]] and [[Chip (rapper)|Chipmunk]] were released as part of this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perpetua|first1=Matthew|title=Sony Drops 'On Air On Sale' U.K. Strategy|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/sony-drops-on-air-on-sale-u-k-strategy-20111012|date=October 12, 2011|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peters Fraser and Dunlop (PFD)''' is a [[Talent agent|talent]] and [[Literary agent|literary agency]] based in [[London]], England. One of the oldest agencies in Britain, and a co-founder of the Association of Authors' Agents,  it is  home to  a distinguished and varied client list, including [[Jeanette Winterson]], [[Ruby Wax]], [[Steve Peters (psychiatrist)|Steve Peters]], [[Helen Rappaport]], [[Simon Schama]], [[William Hague]], [[Sarah Raven]], [[Twiggy]], Sir [[Max Hastings]], [[Chris Patten]], [[Bear Grylls]], [[Valentine Warner]], [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]] and such estates as [[V. S. Pritchett|V.S. Pritchett]], [[E.M. Forster]], [[Georges Simenon]], [[Margery Allingham]] [[C. S. Forester|C.S. Forester]], [[Robert Bolt]], [[Edmund Crispin]] and [[Storm Jameson]].&lt;ref name="Peters Fraser + Dunlop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petersfraserdunlop.com|website=Peters Fraser + Dunlop|ref=www.petersfraserdunlop.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PFD was created when the [[A. D. Peters]] Agency merged with the [[Fraser and Dunlop Agency]] in 1989. Previously, the two agencies had been leaders in their fields with A. D. Peters being one of the most distinguished literary agents in the world, whilst Fraser and Dunlop was one of the most respected agencies working with talent from the film, TV and theatre industries. The merger created a formidable agency and it went on to represent some of the most famous actors, writers and directors of the nineties, including [[Richard Curtis]], [[Nick Hornby]] and [[Kate Winslet]].

In 1999, the agents at PFD sold the company to [[CSS Stellar]]. In 2007 many of these agents left to form [[United Agents]]. In 2008, PFD was bought from CSS Stellar by a consortium led by [[Andrew Neil]]. A settlement was reached with United Agents on all issues, and this allowed both agencies to focus on serving their clients and developing their respective businesses.

The Rights House was formed in 2010, bringing together Peters Fraser and Dunlop, with the talent agency MF Management. Rights House Talent, formerly MF Management, represented leading actors and presenters in film, television and theatre and handled public speaking for all clients.

In 2014, Peters Fraser &amp; Dunlop acquired a majority share in Pollinger Ltd.

Today Peters Fraser + Dunlop, with a literary history dating from 1924, continues to work with and represent writers, journalists, broadcasters, speakers and estates from around the world across all platforms from its offices in [[Covent Garden]].

PFD's literary agents are Caroline Michel, Michael Sissons and Fiona Petheram, Annabel Merullo, Jonathan Sissons, Tim Bates, Nelle Andrew, Camilla Shestopal, Adam Gauntlett, Laura Williams, Alexandra Cliff, Marilia Savvides, Silvia Molteni and Rebecca Wearmouth. Its international rights team is headed by Alexandra Cliff, Film and TV is headed by Jonathan Sissons and its broadcast agents are James Carroll and Jon Fowler.

A '''prebound''' [[book]] is a book that was previously bound and has been rebound with a [[library]] quality hardcover [[book binding|binding]]. In almost all commercial cases, the book in question began as a [[paperback]] version.

An alternate term is "Library Hardcover Paperback".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4548">'''Reaction videos''' are videos in which people react to events. In particular, videos showing the emotional reactions of people viewing television series episodes or film trailers are numerous and popular on [[video hosting service]]s, particularly [[YouTube]]. The depicted persons may or may not be aware that they are being recorded. In some cases, the video being reacted is shown within the reaction video, allowing the reaction video's viewers to see what is being reacted to.

==History==
On television, reaction clips have for a long time been a feature of [[Japanese variety show]]s, showing celebrities and [[tarento]] reacting to video clips. An evolution of earlier 1970s Japanese TV quiz shows that featured audience participants responding to questions, [[Fuji Television]]'s ''[[Naruhodo! The World]]'' in 1981 introduced a format where a panel of celebrities and comedians watched brief videos and answered questions on the video. This eventually evolved into the "[[Wipe (transition)|waipu]]" format, where a "waipu box" superimposed on the corner of the screen shows a celebrity or tarento reacting to a video clip. This reaction format is still widely used in Japanese variety shows, where it is the equivalent of a [[laugh track]] on American television shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gordenker |first=Alice |title=Annoying TV pop-ups |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2011/10/18/reference/annoying-tv-pop-ups/ |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online, one of the first [[viral video|viral]] reaction videos was that of a child reacting to the "[[Scary Maze Game]]" prank on [[YouTube]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="Crave 21 July 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Seibold|first1=Witney|title=Trailer reaction videos are everywhere, but why do they proliferate, and why are they so pointless?|url=http://www.craveonline.com/culture/879173-editorial-trailer-reaction-videos-stupid|accessdate=12 September 2015|work=Crave|date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2007, reaction videos began to proliferate on the Internet. Among their first topics were reactions to the fetish pornography trailer ''[[2 Girls 1 Cup]]''.&lt;ref name="NYTM 25 November 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Sam|title=Watching People Watching People Watching|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/magazine/reaction-videos.html?_r=1|accessdate=12 September 2015|work=New York Times Magazine|date=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, videos of people recording themselves reacting to film trailers had become a staple of services such as [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="Crave 21 July 2015" /&gt; The numerous reaction videos for particularly popular or shocking television events, such as the 2013 ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' episode "[[The Rains of Castamere]]", have themselves become the subject of commentary.&lt;ref name="Wired 6 May 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hudson|first1=Laura|title=What’s Behind Our Obsession With Game of Thrones Reaction Videos|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/06/game-of-thrones-reaction-videos/|accessdate=12 September 2015|work=Wired|date=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Sam Anderson, commenting on the phenomenon for the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'', described it as encapsulating the "fundamental experience of the Internet" in that it involved watching screens on which people watched screens, in a potentially infinite regression.&lt;ref name="NYTM 25 November 2011" /&gt; The first reaction videos for the gross-out "2 Girls 1 Cup" allowed people, according to Anderson, to "experience its dangerous thrill without having to encounter it directly—like [[Perseus]] looking at [[Medusa]] in the reflection of his shield". But much like the later videos featuring reactions to items of popular culture, Anderson wrote, such videos provide the appeal of experiencing, "at a time of increasing cultural difference, the comforting universality of human nature" in showing people of all backgrounds reacting similarly to a shared cultural experience.&lt;ref name="NYTM 25 November 2011" /&gt; In ''[[CraveOnline]]'', Witney Seibold derided reaction videos as "graceless" and "narcissistic", because they merely reflected immediate emotional reactions, and doubted that the reactions of a person aware of being filmed could in fact reflect the honest emotional response promised by the format.&lt;ref name="Crave 21 July 2015" /&gt;

{{short description|theme in fiction and legends}}
{{broader|Rotating locomotion in living systems}}
[[Legend]]s and [[speculative fiction]] reveal a longstanding human fascination with [[Rotating locomotion in living systems|rolling and wheeled creatures]]. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe,{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} Japan,{{r|Pruett}} [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Mexico,{{r|Gambino}} the United States, and Australia,{{r|Full93}} and in numerous modern works.

==Rolling creatures==
[[File:Ill_dict_infernal_p0139-123_buer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Illustration of the demon Buer|The demon [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], from the 1863 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'']]
The [[hoop snake]], a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey.{{r|Full93}} Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the ''[[Tsuchinoko]]''.{{r|Pruett}}

[[Buer (demon)|Buer]], a [[demon]] mentioned in the 16th-century [[grimoire]] ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', was described in [[Jacques Collin de Plancy|Collin de Plancy]]'s 1825 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' as having "the shape of a star or wheel".{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} The 1863 edition of this book featured an illustration by [[Louis Le Breton]], depicting a creature with five legs radially arranged.{{r|de_Plancy_1863}}

[[Neil R. Jones]]' 1937 story "On the Planet Fragment" featured aliens dubbed the Disci, which were shaped like wheels with limbs around the circumference. One of their methods of locomotion was a "rolling motion like that of a cartwheel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?87356|title=Internet Speculative Fiction Database entry for "On the Planet Fragment"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.isfdb.org|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1944 science fiction short story "[[Arena (short story)|Arena]]", by [[Fredric Brown]], features a telepathic alien called an Outsider, which is roughly spherical and moves by rolling.{{r|Brown}} The story was the basis for a 1967 ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode of the [[Arena (Star Trek)|same name]], and possibly also a 1964 episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' entitled [[Fun and Games (The Outer Limits)|"Fun and Games"]], though neither television treatment included a spherical creature.{{r|arena}}

The Dutch graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] invented a creature that was capable of rolling itself forward, which he named ''Pedalternorotandomovens centroculatus articulosus''. He illustrated this creature in his 1951 lithograph {{lang|nl|[[Curl-up|Wentelteefje]]}} (also known by the English title ''Curl-up'').{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Escher}}

A 1956 [[Scrooge McDuck]] comic, ''[[Land Beneath the Ground!]]'', by [[Carl Barks]], introduced Terries and Fermies (a play on the phrase ''[[wikt:terra firma|terra firma]]''), creatures who move from place to place by rolling. The Terries and Fermies have made a sport of their rolling abilities, causing earthquakes in the process.{{r|coa1}}{{r|coa2}}

Northern Irish author [[James White (author)|James White]]'s [[Sector General]] series features "Rollers" from the planet Drambo, doughnut-shaped aquatic organisms that do not have [[heart]]s, but which instead must roll continuously to maintain [[Circulatory system|circulation]] by means of gravity.{{r|"Ambulance_Ship"}}{{r|Louie}} The Rollers are described in the short story "Spacebird" in the 1980 edition of ''[[Ambulance Ship]]'', and in other works in the series.{{r|"Ambulance_Ship"}}{{r|"Final_Diagnosis"}}{{r|"Double_Contact"}}

In ''[[The Citadel of Chaos]]'' (1983) by [[Steve Jackson (British game designer)|Steve Jackson]], the reader may encounter Wheelies, disc-shaped creatures with four arms who move by doing [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheels]].&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomson|first1=Neil|title=Fighting Fantasy Reviewed - The Citadel of Chaos|url=https://rpggeek.com/thread/488700/fighting-fantasy-reviewed-citadel-chaos|website=RPGGeek|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Steve|title=The Citadel of Chaos|date=1983|isbn=978-1-84831-076-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Tuf Voyaging]]'', a 1986 science fiction novel by [[George R. R. Martin]], features an alien called a Rolleram, described as a "berserk living cannonball of enormous size", which kills its prey by rolling over it and crushing it, before digesting it externally. Adults of the species weigh approximately six metric tons and can roll faster than {{convert|50|kph|mph|abbr=off}}.{{r|martin}}

In the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']] video game series, which first appeared in 1991, the eponymous [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and his sidekick [[Miles "Tails" Prower|Tails]] move by rolling.{{r|Sega}}{{r|Thomas}}

The 1995 short story "Microbe", by [[Kenyon College]] biologist and [[feminist science fiction]] writer [[Joan Slonczewski]], describes an exploratory expedition to an alien world whose plant and animal life consists entirely of [[torus|doughnut-shaped]] organisms.{{r|Switzer}}{{r|Slonczewski}}

==Wheeled creatures==
Toy animals with wheels dating from the [[Pre-Columbian era]] were uncovered by archaeologists in [[Veracruz]], Mexico in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans.{{r|Gambino}}

[[File:Wheeler Ozma of Oz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=L. Frank Baum's "Wheeler"|A "Wheeler" in L. Frank Baum's ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' (Illustration by [[John R. Neill]])]]
{{wikisource|Ozma of Oz}}
[[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1907 children's novel ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers.{{r|Baum}}  Their wheels are composed of [[keratin]], which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}} Despite moving quickly on open terrain, the Wheelers are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.{{r|Baum}} They also make an appearance in the 1985 film ''[[Return to Oz]]'', based partly on  ''Ozma of Oz''.

The 1968 novel ''[[The Goblin Reservation]]'' by [[Clifford D. Simak]] features an intelligent alien race that uses biological wheels.{{r|Simak}}

''[[Chorlton and the Wheelies]]'', a British [[stop motion|stop-motion]]-animated television series that aired from 1976 to 1979, was set in "Wheelie World", which was inhabited by three-wheeled creatures called "wheelies".{{r|Toonhound}}

[[Piers Anthony]]'s 1977 book ''[[Cluster (novels)|Cluster]]'' and its sequels feature aliens called Polarians, which locomote by gripping and balancing atop a large ball. The ball is a living, though temporarily separable, portion of the Polarian's body.{{r|anthony}}

[[David Brin]]'s [[Uplift Universe|''Uplift'' Universe]] includes a wheeled species called the g'Kek, which are described in some detail in the 1995 novel ''[[Brightness Reef]]''.{{r|Brin95}} In 1996's ''[[Infinity's Shore]]'', a g'Kek is described as looking like "a squid in a wheelchair." The g'Kek suffer from [[arthritis|arthritic]] axles in their old age, particularly when living in a [[gravitational biology|high gravity environment]].{{r|Brin95}}{{r|Brin96}}

A 1997 novel in the ''[[Animorphs]]'' series, ''[[The Andalite Chronicles]]'', includes an alien called a Mortron, composed of two separate entities: a yellow and black bottom half with four wheels, and a red, elongated head with razor-sharp teeth and concealed wings.{{r|Applegate}}

The 2000 novel ''[[The Amber Spyglass]]'', by English author [[Philip Pullman]], features an alien race known as the [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]], which have diamond-shaped bodies with one leg at the front and back and one on each side. The Mulefa use large, disk-shaped seed pods as wheels. They mount the pods on bone axles on their front and back legs, while propelling themselves with their side legs. The Mulefa have a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with the seed pod trees, which depend on the rolling action to crack open the pods and allow the seeds to [[Seed dispersal|disperse]].{{r|Pullman}}

In the 2000 novel [[Wheelers (novel)|''Wheelers'']], by English mathematician [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and reproductive biologist [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]], a [[Jupiter|Jovian]] species called "blimps" has developed the ability to biologically produce machines called "wheelers", which use wheels for locomotion.{{r|Stewart}}{{r|kirkus}}

The children's television series ''[[Jungle Junction]]'', which premiered in 2009, features hybrid jungle animals with wheels rather than legs;{{r|BBC-Jungle}} one such animal, Ellyvan, is a hybrid of an [[elephant]] and a [[van]].{{r|junglejunction}} These animals traverse their habitat on elevated [[highway]]s.{{r|disney}}

'''Romanesque architecture in Spain''' is the architectural style reflective of [[Romanesque architecture]], with peculiar influences both from architectural styles outside the [[Iberian peninsula]] via [[Italy]] and [[France]] as well as traditional architectural patterns from within the peninsula. Romanesque architecture was developed in and propagated throughout Europe for more than two centuries, ranging approximately from the late tenth century until well into the thirteenth century.

During the eighth century, though [[Carolingian Renaissance]] extended its influence to [[Christian]] [[Western Europe]], Christian Spain remained attached to the traditional [[Hispano-Roman]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] culture, without being influenced by European cultural movements, until the arrival of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]].

Romanesque architecture spread throughout the entire northern half of Spain, reaching as far as the [[Tagus river]], at the height of the ''[[Reconquista]]'' and ''[[Repoblación]]'', movements which greatly favoured the Romanesque development. The [[First Romanesque]] style spread from [[Lombardy]] to the [[Països Catalans|Catalan region]] via the ''[[Marca Hispánica]]'', where it was developed and from where it spread to the rest of the peninsula with the help of the [[Camino de Santiago]] and the [[Benedictine]] monasteries. Its mark was left especially on religious buildings (e.g. cathedrals, churches, monasteries, cloisters, chapels) which have survived into the twenty-first century, some better preserved than others. Civil monuments (bridges, palaces, castles, walls and towers) were also built in this style, although few have survived.

==Background and historical context==
[[File:Oviedo - San Miguel de Lillo.jpg|thumb|[[San Miguel de Lillo Church]], example of [[Asturia]]n art.]]
[[File:Monasterio de San Miguel de Escalada.jpg|thumb|[[San Miguel de Escalada]], a [[Mozarabic architecture|Mozarabic]] monastery in [[León (province)|León]]]]
The Romanesque period corresponds to a time when Christianity was more secure and optimistic. Europe had seen, in the preceding centuries, the decline of the Carolingian splendour and had undergone [[Norman Invasion|Norman]] and [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian]] invasions (the Hungarians reached as far as [[Burgundy]]) that resulted in the destruction of many of the peninsula's monasteries. In Spain the [[Almanzor]] campaigns were disastrous, also razing and destroying many of the monasteries and small churches.

Towards the end of the tenth century, a number of stabilizing events restored some balance and tranquillity in Europe, greatly easing the political situation and life in Christendom. The main forces that emerged were the [[Ottomans]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], including the [[pope]], whose power became universal and who had the power in Rome to crown emperors. In Spain the Christian kings were well underway with the ''[[Reconquista]]'', signing pacts and cohabitation charters with the Muslim kings. Within this context an organizational spirit emerged throughout Christendom with the monks from [[Cluny]]. Monasteries and churches were built during these years and architecture was geared towards more durable structures to withstand future attack as well as fire and natural disasters. The use of a vault instead of a wood covering spread throughout Europe.

Additionally communications were re-established and there was [[rapprochement]] between various European monarchs as well as restored relations with [[Byzantium]]. The Roman legacy of roads and highways allowed better communication between the numerous monasteries and facilitated pilgrimages to the holy places or small enclaves of popular devotion. As a result, commerce was increased and the movement of people disseminated new lifestyles, among which was the Romanesque style. Shrines, cathedrals, and others, were built in the Romanesque style over nearly two and a half centuries.

==Artists and professionals==
In the Middle Ages, the concept of "architect" – as understood amongst the Romans – fell out of use, giving way to a social change. The duties of the former architect came to rest on the master builder. This was an artist who, in most cases, took part in the actual construction along with the team of workers which he had under his command. The master builder was the one who oversaw the edifice (as the ancient architect did), but at the same time could also be a craftsman, a sculptor, a carpenter or stonecutter. This person was usually educated in monasteries or groups of unionized masonic lodges. Many of these master builders were the designers of gorgeous portals or porticos, such as the one at the [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral]] made by [[Master Mateo]], the portico of the [[Nogal de las Huertas]] in [[Palencia]], by Master Jimeno, or the north portal of the San Salvador de [[Ejea de los Caballeros]] Church (in Zaragoza province) by Master Agüero.
[[File:Santiago Catedral Pórtico da gloria GDFL6.JPG|thumb|left|Sculptures in the [[Portico of Glory]] of the [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral]], work of [[Master Mateo]].]]

All Romanesque architectural work was made up of the director (master builder), a foreman in charge of a large group forming workshops of stonecutters, masons, sculptors, glassmakers, carpenters, painters and many other trades or specialties, who moved from one place to another. These crews formed workshops from which local masters often emerged, who were able to raise rural churches. In this set we must not forget the most important figure, the patron or developer, without whom the work would not be completed.

From documents that have survived in Spain about works contracts, litigation and other issues, it is known that a house or living accommodation was allocated in the cathedrals for the master and his family. There are litigation documents that speak of the problems of the widow of a master, where she claimed for herself and her family a house for life. In some cases, this issue presented a real conflict as the subsequent master of the building would also need to occupy the house.

The master builders frequently had to commit themselves for a lifetime if the work were long-term, as was the case of Master Mateo with the construction of the [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral]] or Master [[Ramon Llambard]] (or Raimundo Lambardo) with the Santa Maria de Urgel Cathedral. There was a provision in the contracts requiring that masters always provide: their daily presence on site and strict control of workers and of the progress of the building.

A work house was also always built for the preparation of materials and carving of the stone. Many fourteenth-century documents&lt;ref name=Torviso&gt;{{cite book|last=Bango Torviso|first=Isidro|title=Tesoros de España (Spanish Treasures) |publisher=Espasa Calpe|location=Madrid|isbn=84-239-6674-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; speak of this house:
&lt;blockquote&gt;La obra de iglesia de Burgos que há unas casas cerca de la dicha iglesia en que tienen todas las cosas que son menester para la dicha obra; e los libros de las cuentas é todas las otras herramientas con que labran los maestros en la dicha obra.{{es}} &lt;br&gt;(The construction of the Burgos church that has some houses near the said church in which they have all the things that are necessary for said work; and the books of the accounts and all other tools with which the masters labour in the said work.)&lt;ref name="Torviso"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Stonemasons===
[[File:Codex Calixtinus (Liber Sancti Jacobi) F0173k.jpg|thumb|''[[Codex Calixtinus]]''.]]
Stonemasons formed the bulk of workers in the erection of the building. The number of stonecutters could vary depending on the local economy. Some of these numbers are known, such as the Old Cathedral of Salamanca, which employed between 25 and 30. Aymeric Picaud in his [[Codex Calixtinus]] provides data that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] ''with about 50 other stonemasons who worked there regularly, under the caring direction of Don Wicarto'' (''con aproximadamente otros 50 canteros que allí trabajaban asiduamente, bajo la solícita dirección de don Wicarto'')[...]&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{Cite book |title=Los constructores de la España medieval |first1=Rafael |last1=Cómez Ramos |first2=Rafael |last2=Cómez |publisher=Universidad de Sevilla |year=2006 |isbn=9788447210176 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Cantero.jpg|thumb|left|A relief from the Magdalena Church in [[Tudela, Navarre]], depicting a stonecutter.]]
These masons and other workers were exempted from paying taxes. They were separated in two groups depending on their specialization. The first group those who were engaged in a special high-quality work (genuine sculpting artists) and who worked at their own pace, leaving their completed work at the site to be later placed on the building. The second group were permanent employees, who raised buildings stone upon stone and put in place those quality pieces or carved reliefs done by the first group at the right time. This way of working could lead to a time lag in the pieces being placed some time after being created, a lag in many cases which has become a big problem for historians in dating the building.

There was also a group of unskilled labourers who worked wherever there was a need. In many cases these people offered their work or skill as an act of mercy because as Christians they were willing to collaborate on a great work dedicated to their God. In any case they received a remuneration that was either by the day or per piece. In documents many names appear on lists of daily wages so this act was not arbitrary but rather well regulated.

Among the Cistercians they became known as ''cuadrillas de ponteadores'' (scoring crews),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last =Lampérez y Romea |first= Vicente |title=Historia de la arquitectura cristiana | work= Manuales Gallach |publisher= Editorial Espasa Calpe |location= Madrid |year=1935 |page= 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; made up of laymen or monks who moved from one county to another, always under the direction of a professional monk, whose job it was to pave grounds, build roads, or build bridges.

===Anonymity and artists' signatures===
[[File:Monestir de Sant Cugat del Vallès 6.jpg|thumb|Arnaldo Cadell's signature, in the [[Sant Cugat Monastery]].]]
Most Romanesque works are anonymous in the sense of lacking a signature or proof of authorship. Even if the work is signed, specialists historians sometimes have difficulty distinguishing whether reference is made to the actual creator or the sponsor of the work. Sometimes however, the signature is followed or preceded by an explanation that clarifies whether it is one or the other person. [[Arnau Cadell]] made it clear on the [[Sant Cugat del Vallès|Sant Cugat]] capital: ''This is the image of Arnau Cadell sculptor who built this cloister for posterity.''

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;hec est arnalli sculptoris forma catelli qui claustrum tale construxit perpetuale {{it}}&lt;/center&gt;

Rodrigo Gustioz also wanted to be immortalized for his funding of an arch in the Santa Maria de Lebanza: Rodrigo Gustioz made this arc, a man from Valbuena, soldier, pray for him.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;isto arco fecitrodricus gustiut vir valdebonus militeorate pro illo {{it}}&lt;/center&gt;

This notice by another sponsor appears on a capital:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''El prior Pedro Caro hizo esta iglesia, casa, claustro y todo lo que aquí está fundado en el año 1185.'' {{es}} &lt;br&gt;Prior Pedro Caro made this church, house, cloister and everything here was founded in 1185.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other cases it is the systematic study of the sculpture along with the architecture that has allowed historians to draw conclusions. Thus it is known that in the Lleida Cathedral, [[Pere de Coma]] served as master builder from 1190-1220, but during that period there were also several clearly differentiated sculpture workshops. The same study conducted in the [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral]] suggests [[Master Mateo]] as the promoter and director of successive workshops which has aspects performed by different hands but under one coherent direction.&lt;ref name=Torviso&gt;page 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that most Romanesque works have remained anonymous has developed the theory that the artist considered that he was not the right person to place his name on works dedicated to God. However, on one hand, the few civil works that remain are not signed either and on the other hand, such a view is countered by a long list that could be given of artists who sign their works themselves, among which are:

*Raimundo de Monforte, which appears in 1129 documents as contracted to build the [[Lugo Cathedral]].
*Pedro Deustamben, appears on a funeral epitaph in [[San Isidoro de León]] as builder of the domes.
*Raimundo Lambard or Lambardo, who worked from 1175 on the [[Urgell Cathedral]].
*Masters Bernardo el Viejo, Roberto and Esteban who worked on the [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral]].
*Master Pere de Coma, who worked in the late twelfth century on the [[Lleida Cathedral]].
*Master Micaelis, who worked on several churches and chapels in northern [[Palencia]], and left his portrait while working on the [[portal (architecture)|portal]] of {{Interlanguage link multi|San Cornelio and San Cipriano Church, Revilla de Santullán|es|3=Iglesia de San Cornelio y San Cipriano (Revilla de Santullán)|lt=San Cornelio &amp; San Cipriano}} in [[Palencia (province)|Palencia]].

[[File:Románico palentino - Micaelis me fecit.JPG|thumb|''Micaelis me fecit'' signature on {{Interlanguage link multi|San Cornelio and San Cipriano Church, Revilla de Santullán|es|3=Iglesia de San Cornelio y San Cipriano (Revilla de Santullán)|lt=San Cornelio &amp; San Cipriano's Church}}, [[Palencia (province)|Palencia]].]]
The list could be extended with many more names which appeared right on the stone itself by way of signature or on procurement documents, as proof that the intended construction was neither prohibited nor discouraged.&lt;ref name=Torviso&gt;pages 23-25&lt;/ref&gt; What is difficult to distinguish in many cases is the trade of the person signing as they could either be architects, specialized stonemasons or sculptors of selected pieces. All of them were often called Master and all used his craft during the construction according to the wishes and the mandate of the promoters and patrons.

===Developers and sponsors===
[[File:Ermita de Santa María de La Piscina - Sureste.JPG|thumb|right|[[Santa María de La Piscina Hermitage]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], construction ordered by [[Ramiro Sánchez, Lord of Monzón|Ramiro Sánchez]], the Navarran ''[[infante]]''.]]
In the Romanesque world both the promoter of the works as well as the patron and financier were the true stars of the architectural work or the work of art to be created. They are in charge and determine how the work should be done, what should be the characters or the saints in sculpture and reliefs, the geometric dimensions (which then will be the responsibility of the true professional to carry them out with mathematical rigor) and they encourage and exalt the project. The promoters were in charge of hiring and also calling the best artists and architects who worked with their momentum and enthusiasm.

Especially in sculpture and painting, the artist was fully submitted to the will of the patrons and sponsors, without whose intervention the work would never be done. The Romanesque artist adapted to the will of these people giving the best work of his trade and complying with the satisfaction of a job well done without having any desire nor intending to acquire worldwide fame as he began to develop from the Renaissance. The pride of a job well done and the recognition of his peers and patron were the greatest of the awards and so sometimes this pride led them to put it very simply in one of his finished works.

In Spain, kings and a minority of the nobility introduced the new Romanesque trends early on (which carried with it a Benedictine renewal and acceptance of the [[Roman Liturgy]]), while another part of the nobility and most of the bishops and monks still clung to the old ways and the Hispanic liturgy. However the Romanesque fully triumphed and this was mainly due to the patrons and promoters who carried out great works from which the new style was developed throughout the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula.

[[File:Abad oliba.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Abbot Oliba]] (''abad'' Oliba) in [[Vic]]h, Catalonia]]
[[Abbot Oliba]] was a patron, sponsor and huge promoter of Romanesque art in Catalonia from an early date. In 1008 he was appointed abbot of the monasteries in [[Ripoll]] and [[Cuixá]] and ten years later he was appointed bishop of [[Vic]]h. His travels to Rome (1011 and 1016) and his contact with Franco monasticism, accounted for his knowledge of the Roman liturgy and its introduction into the Catalan Church. The [[Edgar the Peaceful#Benedictine Reform|Benedictine reform]] in [[Cluny]] had a considerable impact on Cuixá with which Oliba maintained close relations. Oliba adopted Cluny's standards, both in architecture as well as customs and under his patronage and direction major reforms were carried out, new buildings or in other cases mere extensions to suit the needs of the times. During these initial years Abbot Oliba endeavored to be present at consecrations - meetings in which discussions regarding a particular construction, etc. were held. Oliba, during the period between 1030 and 1040&lt;ref&gt;Puig i Cadafalch defined this period as the Golden Age of architecture in Catalonia.&lt;/ref&gt; was the driving force behind important buildings such as:

*[[Church of Sant Vicenç]], completely rebuilt.
*[[Montserrat (monastery)|Montserrat]] and Montbuy Monasteries.
*The [[Ripoll Monastery|Ripoll]], [[Cuixá]], [[abbey of Saint-Martin-du-Canigou|St-Martin-du-Canigou]] and [[Vic Cathedral|Vic]] Monasteries, the latter of which he was personally and directly involved.
*[[Sant Pere de Rodes]].
*[[Girona Cathedral]].

==Architectural schools in Spain==
[[File:StoDomingo-Conjunto.jpg|[[Iglesia de Santo Domingo, Soria]], Poitou school|thumb|left]]

[[File:Portada románica de la Colegiata de Toro. (Zamora).JPG|Portal of the [[Collegiate Church of Toro]], Périgord school|thumb|left]]

In Spain geographical schools of architecture such as those in France, are not easily distinguished, because they are usually mixed with other architectural forms. However, there are a variety of buildings that can be clearly identified, if not entirely but to a large extent, as following the pattern of these French schools:

*The [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] School seen in the [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral]] and the [[San Vicente Basilica]] in Avila.
*The [[Poitou]] School, with [[Santo Domingo de Soria]] and most twelfth-century Catalan churches, such as [[Sant Pere de Rodes]] and [[Sant Pere de Galligants]].
*The [[Périgord]] School, examples of which are now part of the transition to the Gothic, such as the [[Collegiate Church of Toro|Toro Collegiate]] (except its Byzantine-influenced dome).

===Local variations===
[[File:Sahagun San Lorenzo 01 lou.JPG|thumb|San Lorenzo church in [[Sahagún, Spain|Sahagún]], in a Romanesque-[[Mudéjar]] style.]]
Each kingdom, region or geographic region of the peninsula, and some human events (such as the [[Camino de Santiago]]), marked a distinctive style influenced by the geographical environment itself, by tradition, or simply by the gangs of hired masons and builders who moved from one place to another. As a result, in Romanesque architecture in Spain there are variations such as Catalan Romanesque, Aragonese Romanesque, Palencia Romanesque, Castilian and Leónese Romanesque, among others.

Another fact to consider is the survival of the [[Moorish]] populations, who formed gangs of workers and artists who gave a special stamp to buildings. These are what is known as brick Romanesque or Moorish Romanesque.

==Romanesque periods==

[[File:Torre San Martín de Frómista.jpg|thumb|The jagged design is perfectly seen in the tower and wall of the [[San Martín de Tours, Fromista]].]]
In Spain, as in the rest of the Western Christian world, Romanesque art developed over three stages with their own characteristics. Historiography has defined these stages as early Romanesque, full Romanesque and late Romanesque.

*[[First Romanesque]]:&lt;ref&gt;The definition was coined by the Spanish architect and historian Puig i Cadafalch in his book ''La geografía i els origens del primer Art Romanic'' (The geography and origin of the first Romanesque art), Barcelona 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; architecture comprises a well-defined geographical area that runs from northern Italy, Mediterranean France, Burgundy and Catalan and Aragonese lands in Spain. It developed from the late tenth century until the middle of the eleventh century, except in isolated locations. During this Romanesque period, there were neither miniature paintings nor monumental sculptures.
*Full Romanesque: developed from east towards Lisbon and from the south of Italy to Scandinavia. It spread, thanks to the monastic movement, the unification of the Catholic faith with the Roman liturgy and communication channels along the routes. It began its launch in the first half of the eleventh century and continued until mid-twelfth century. The best examples are in the "pilgrimage churches" (e.g. the Santiago cathedral), especially in areas of the ''[[repoblación]]''. It is characterized by the inclusion of monumental sculptures in the portals and spandrels and for the decoration and styling of the capitals, mouldings, fascias, etc. &lt;br&gt;The [[Cathedral of Jaca|Jaca Cathedral]] was one of the first temples – if not the first – that was elevated with the aesthetic ideas and architecture of this Romanesque style which entered the peninsula with large French Romanesque influences. The decoration of its imposts and Romanesque arches with geometric themed checkerboard played a role in many of the buildings that were later built, giving this style the name of beleaguered or chequered Jaques.
*Late Romanesque: chronologically it was diffused from the end of the full Romanesque period until the first quarter of the thirteenth century, when it began to be succeeded by [[Gothic art]]. This period was the busiest in terms of the construction of monasteries by the Cistercian monks.

==Construction of Romanesque buildings in Spain==
[[File:San Martiño de Mondoñedo, Foz.jpg|thumb|Rural Romanesque of the San Martín de [[Mondoñedo]] Church in [[Lugo (province)|Lugo]].]]
Romanesque religious buildings were never as monumental as the French constructions, or the constructions that later gave rise to [[Gothic art|Gothic]] art. The first buildings designs had thick walls and small openings through which a dim light could enter from outside. Later there was an evolution in the construction of the walls allowing the buildings to be better lightened and for opening bigger windows.

The monastic buildings were the most numerous sharing importance with the cathedrals. Churches and parishes were constructed in cities while in small towns countless small churches, known as rural Romanesque, were built.

===Material===
[[File:Muro piedra castillo Ponferrada lou.JPG|thumb|[[Ponferrada]] Castle, example of construction material.]]
The most precious but also the most expensive material was the stone. The stonemasons busied themselves carving it with a chisel, always selecting the good face of the block. These were made into [[ashlar]]s, which were generally available in horizontal rows and sometimes used along the edges. Hard rocks were almost always used. Masonry was also used, with hewn stone in the corners, windows and doors. If the stone was hard to get, because the corresponding geographic location had no quarries, or because it was too expensive at certain times, they used baked brick, slate or any ashlars stone. Paint and plaster were used as finish, both for the stone as well as for the masonry and the other materials, so that, once the walls were painted, it was difficult to distinguish whether it had one or the other underneath. Colourful Romanesque architecture was as widespread as it had been in Roman buildings.&lt;ref name="Torviso"/&gt;

===Foundations===
[[File:Tarragona ruinas iglesia romanica lou.JPG|thumb|left|Ruins and foundations of a Romanesque basilica, [[Tarraco Amphitheatre]].]]
Medieval builders did extensive study for the foundation, taking into account the type of building that was to be built, the materials that were to be used and the ground upon which the building would be laid. First deep ditches were dug and were filled with stones and rubble. Trenches were distributed under the walls that would go over them and others were made crosswise in order to join the passageways together and strengthen the pillars of the [[transverse arches]]. The foundation formed a network that practically sketched the plan of the temple, thus differing from the isolated foundation for the support of the pillars used in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. In some ruined churches all that remains is this foundation, giving archaeologists good study material. Archaeologists are able to determine the thickness of the walls from these revealed remains of the foundations, although it is known that in this respect the builders rather exaggerated and made excessively deep trenches and overly thick foundation for fear of landslides.

===Vaults, naves and ceilings===

[[File:Zamora catedral cupula gallonada lou.JPG|thumb|Galloned Dome, in stone, [[Zamora Cathedral]].]]

During the [[First Romanesque]] period, many rural churches were still being covered with a wooden roof, more so in Catalonia and especially in the [[Boi Valley]] where the Romanesque renewal of old churches was done by [[Lombardy|Lombard]] builders who covered the gabled [[nave]]s with a wooden structure, respecting the old traditions of the region. However, the apse in these churches was always topped with an oven [[Vault (architecture)|vault]].

Throughout the eleventh century, naves were covered with [[barrel vault]]s, either a half barrel or a quarter barrel, a device used in Romanesque architecture throughout Europe. Later the groin vault was used. In Catalonia, these barrel vaults were used without reinforcements, while in Castile and León arches were used as support. The use of the groin vault (arising from the crossing of two perpendicular barrel vaults) had been lost and was later taken up by great master builders. The groin vault in turn gave way to the ribbed vault, which later became very common in Gothic architecture.

The type of vaults used exclusively on the stairs of the towers were also called helical vaults. Examples of their use are at [[San Martín de Fromista]], [[Sant Pere de Galligants]] and [[San Salvador de Leyre]], among others.

Corner vaults were built in the cloisters of monasteries and cathedrals. These result from the meeting of two groups in a cloister. The finishing of these vaults was not very easy, so builders had to use various tricks that ensured that flaws were not easily visible to the naked eye.

===Arches===
[[File:Avila San Pedro View.jpg|left|thumb|Romanesque portal with archivolts, {{Interlanguage link multi|San Pedro Church, Ávila|es|3=Iglesia de San Pedro (Ávila)|lt=San Pedro Church}}, [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]]]]
[[File:Duraton Iglesia portal1.jpg|thumb|Polilobulated arc, {{Interlanguage link multi|Our Lady of the Assumption Church (Segovia)|es|3=Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción (Duratón)|lt=Our Lady of the Assumption}}, Segovia]]
In Spain the most used arch was the semicircular although the horseshoe arch and the pointed arch were also used. The arch was used exclusively throughout the eleventh century and first half of the twelfth century. In order to achieve certain heights, the vaults were made quite stilted, as in [[Sant Joan de les Abadesses]]. Many arcs were built doubled with the intention that they would be stronger. Later, in the portals, arches were formed with archivolts, i.e. a sequence of concentric arches decorated with simple or decorative plants or geometric mouldings.

Pointed arches came from the Orient. It is unknown the exact date of their use in Romanesque architecture in Spain, although historians proposed some dates based on buildings containing one or more pointed arches that sometimes spawn an entire vault in some of its parts. There are buildings that correspond to the first quarter of the twelfth century, such as the Lugo and Santa Maria de Terrassa cathedrals. The early use of these arcs became a construction element which provided many advantages. It was an architectural breakthrough that the Cistercian monks were able to see from the beginning.

===Buttresses===
[[File:Burgos - Las Huelgas - Vista portada02.jpg|thumb|Buttresses. [[Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas]] Monastery in [[Burgos]]]]

[[File:Soria San Juan de Ravanera abside romanico lou.JPG|thumb|left|Buttress of fluted pilasters with capitals, [[Church of San Juan de Rabanera]], Soria]]

Buttresses are continuous thick vertical walls that are placed at the sides of an arch or vault to counteract attacks. They were also placed on the outer walls of the naves of churches or cloisters. In Romanesque architecture are always visible is one of the elements that characterize it, especially in Spanish architecture, except in the Catalonia area where construction was done adopting a greater thickness of the walls.

===Covers===
[[File:Valladolid torre romanica LaAntigua lou.jpg|thumb|Romanesque tower of the [[La Antigua, León|La Antigua church]] in [[Valladolid]].]]
The buildings were covered with a roof that could be made of different materials:

*Stone (used frequently). These covers can still be seen in the Gallo tower of the old of Salamanca cathedral and the Ávila Cathedral.
*Roof tile - capable of being changed frequently, the material resists weathering over time.
*Glazed sheets, rare materials. It is located in the spire of the tower of the former Valladolid.
*Slate, especially in areas where this material is abundant, especially in Galicia.

===Towers===
In Spanish buildings towers are located in different parts of the church - on the sides, over the transept and, in very special cases, over the straight section of the apse, as in the churches of the city of [[Sahagún, León|Sahagún]] in León. This placement was because, being built of brick (a material less consistent than stone), the builders had to locate the towers in the strongest, more resistant section (usually at the apses). A façade made up of two towers was not very common and usually seen only in temples of great importance.

Towers served as steeples, especially in the Romanesque styles in Castile and León, they are what are called ''Turres signorum''. In many cases they were built as defence towers, especially in border territories experiencing military conflict, and the location of the tower depended on what was being defended. Thus the tower of the church of the Silos monastery was located to defend the monastery, the tower of the [[San Pedro de Arlanza]] monastery was a very important defence for the entire area. The military aspect of these Romanesque towers evolved and changed over time so that at present it is difficult to guess at their original purpose or purpose for which they were used in other eras. In many cases these towers were attached to the sides of the church, and some even completely independent of the churches.

===Bell-gables===
[[File:Cámara Santa, exterior.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cámara Santa]] in [[Oviedo]].]]
A [[gable]] is an architectural element that is usually built on the façade and used, instead of a tower, to house the bells. The [[bell-gable]] (referred to as ''espadaña'' in the Iberian peninsula) was built as a vertical continuation of the wall and the spans were opened to receive the bells. The gable was easier and cheaper to build. In Spanish Romanesque they were very numerous especially in smaller rural Romanesque churches. They were made of a single span or several terraced storeys. They usually had pointed or pinion tops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Valladolid_monasterio_Valbuena_12_obras2001_lou.jpg See image]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are all kinds of gables in the Romanesque style of [[Campoo]] and Valderredible. There are some spectacular ones in other locations such as the one at [[Agullana]] in the Alto Ampurdán or the [[Astudillo (Palencia)|Astudillo]], with five openings. There are more modest ones such as at the [[Santa María de Valbuena|Santa Maria de Valbuena]] Monastery where its veins also have a unique placement.

[[File:San Pedro de Arlanza - Ábside - Restos de pintura 01.jpg|thumb|[[Monastery of San Pedro de Arlanza]], Burgos: Traces of paint in the apse, 11th–12th century.]]

===Paintings===
During the Romanesque era, a building was not considered finished until its walls had appropriate paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Throughout the nineteenth century (and later during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries), a restorative style consisting of exposing the construction materials of the walls emerged, removing all traces of paint both inside and outside, based on misguided historicist theoretical standards from the sixteenth century. Bango Torviso, Isidro G. ''Tesoros de España. Vol. III. Románico''; Blanco Martín, Francisco Javier. ''Iniciación al Arte Románico''. Fundación de Santa María la Real. Aguilar de Campo.&lt;/ref&gt; The walls of the most important and significant parts (especially the apses) were lined inside with iconographic paintings, many of which have come down to the twenty-first century, such as those belonging to churches in the [[Tahull|Tahull Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Imagen:Meister aus Tahull 001.jpg|See image]]&lt;/ref&gt; The walls, both inside and out, were covered with a layer of paint in one color and the imposts, vains and columns were highlighted in the original material, but sometimes they were also painted in bright colors: green, yellow, ocher, red and blue. This custom of painting or revoking the buildings was not new or unique to the Romanesque of the Middle Ages but represented an inheritance or continuity of the construction method from olden times.

Whether the material used was stone, ashlar or if the masonry was in bricks, the finish was a painted surface. Thus, in many cases it could not be determined if the exterior was made of stone or brick, which could only be determined from plaster scrapings. The paint finish gave the buildings protection against environmental assaults but these were removed in the nineteenth-century when theories were applied to expose the original building materials.

Some of these paintings have remained in certain buildings, as a testimony of the past, on walls, sculptures and capitals. On the façade of the {{Interlanguage link multi|San Martín de Segovia Church|es|3=Iglesia de San Martín (Segovia)}}, traces of paint were still visible into the twentieth century, as witnessed and described by the Spanish historian Marqués de Lozoya. Sometimes carving the baskets of the capitals was too expensive and they were left completely smooth so that the painter could finish them with floral or historical motifs. In the [[San Paio de Abeleda]] church in [[Ourense]], there are vestiges of paintings on some capitals, which have even been repainted throughout its history. Fragments of capitals with their original painting have been found among the ruins of the [[San Pedro de Arlanza]] monastery and they give an indication of how the rest was decorated.

[[Cistercian monks|Cistercian]] and [[Premonstratensians]] monks also painted the walls of their churches, in white or a light earthy color, and they sometimes outlined the joints of the blocks.

===Sculptures===
The use of sculptures as decoration for buildings during the full Romanesque period was something so commonplace that it was considered a necessity. Architecture and sculpting represented an inseparable iconographical program. The idea of the Church (an idea developed and disseminated by the Benedictines of Cluny), was to teach Christian doctrine through the sculptures and paintings of the apses and interior walls. The capitals of the columns, the [[spandrels]], the [[friezes]], the [[cantilevers]] and the [[archivolts]] of the portals were intricately decorated with stories from the Old and New Testaments. These sculptures were not limited to religious depictions but also covered a number of profane but equally important issues to the eleventh- and twelfth-century population, such as field work, the calendar (as in the case of the capitals of the Santa María la Real de Nieva cloister, from late Romanesque), war, customs, among others. In other buildings real, mythological and symbolic animals were sculpted, plus allegories of vices and virtues (the best example can be given in the erotic corbels of the San Pedro de Cervatos Collegiate in southern Cantabria). These decorations were not always of a historical or animals type; geometric decoration was very important at the beginning of the Romanesque thus floral and plant decoration were also used. Often the carved [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] or the frieze depicted a series of images along the capitals of the columns of the archivolts.

==Churches==
[[File:Planta de la Catedral de Santiago. Descripcion histórico-artística-arqueológica de la Catedral de Santiago. 1866.jpg|thumb|left|Floor plan of the [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral]].]]

The temples of the [[First Romanesque]] are simple, with a single nave topped by a semicircular apse (without a [[transept]]). The prototype of the Romanesque church was non-rural, medium-sized and with the floor plan of a basilica with three naves containing three semicircular apses and a transept. Throughout the twelfth century the traditional Hispanic type temples with three straight and terraced apses were still being built in some areas (such as in the city of [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]]). Church plans were adapted to the liturgical needs, as the number of canons or friars who required more altars for their religious functions was increasing. Temples were built with Benedictine [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]]-style apses added. A long transept that could accommodate more apses was adopted in [[Cistercian]] architecture, and there are more examples of this type of construction. This feature was also adopted by the cathedrals (Tarragona, Lleida, Ourense and [[Sigüenza]]). There are also examples of [[cruciform plan|cruciform structures]] that precisely depict a [[Latin cross]], such as the eleventh-century Santa Marta de Tera church in Zamora, or the San Lorenzo de Zorita del Páramo church in Palencia, whose header is not square but semicircular. There are also circular plans, with a single nave such as the San Marcos church in Salamanca, or the Vera Cruz church in Segovia.

===Vestry===
In the Romanesque era small churches or parish churches did not have [[vestries]]. Vestries were only added to these churches beginning in the sixteenth century. However, in the grand monasteries or cathedrals there was a space adapted in the cloister for this purpose.

===Crypts===
[[Crypts]] are one of the characteristic features of Romanesque architecture. In the [[First Romanesque]], its use spread due to the influence of the [[Franks]]. Spaces were built just below the top of the church and were intended for keeping the relics of martyrs, the worship of whom came about from [[Carolingian]] influence. They usually had three naves with a groin vault cover, although there are variations, such as the circular crypt with a pillar in the center ([[Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa|Cuixá]] and [[Sant Pere de Rodes]]). Throughout the eleventh century, they began to lose importance as recipients of relics and were instead built for practical and necessary architectural purposes, adapting to the terrain on which the church was built (this is the function of the [[Monastery of Leyre]] crypt). Throughout the twelfth century, few crypts were built and those that were built were due to the uneven ground. Later the crypts were converted to [[funerary]] purposes.

===Tribunes===
The [[Tribune (architecture)|tribunes]] were galleries over the aisles that were used by important people to monitor the liturgy. They had little importance in Romanesque Spain, with their construction being very scarce. Two examples are known: the [[San Vicente, Ávila|San Vicente de Avila]] and the [[Basilica of San Isidoro]]. Traditional historiography suggests that, in the latter church, the tribune was a special place for [[Sancha of León|Queen Sancha]], wife of [[Ferdinand I of León and Castile|Ferdinand I]], but more recent studies show that the dates do not match. There is little information on this architecture.

===Triforia===
A [[triforium]] is a gallery with arches running along the top of the lower naves of a church, below the large windows of the main nave. It sometimes surrounds the apse at the same height. Its origin was purely cosmetic, since if the nave was too high there was a heavy space between the ceiling windows and the supporting arches of the lower lateral naves.

At first the arch of the triforium was not set, but it was then thought that it could be used to provide light and ventilation, while leaving a passage for building services and surveillance. This construction could be done because the aisles are always pushed into the central nave, thus leaving a usable hole of the same depth as the width of the aisle. This element had its true development in the Gothic era. In Spanish Romanesque architecture triforia are scarce because the bare wall was usually left in their place or a blind arcade was built.

A good example of a triforium is the Santiago de Compostela cathedral. The aisles of this temple has two floors and the triforium occupies the entire second, covering the entire building and lining the outside by a series of windows that provide light and interior arches. Another example is in the Lugo Cathedral, although in this case it runs along all the walls. In San Vicente de Ávila the triforium is a dark gallery that does not provide light from outside.

In some pilgrimage churches the triforium was at times used as an area for overnight accommodation for pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Guillermo Fatás and Gonzalo M. Borrás |title= Diccionario de términos de arte y arqueología (Dictionary of Art and Architectural terminology). |publisher=Guara Editorial |location= Zaragoza |year= 1980 |language=Spanish |isbn= 84-85303-29-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Porticos and galleries===
The [[portico]] is a space originally designed for preventing inclement weather. It was constructed in both rural and city churches, in front of the main door to protect it. In most cases they were made with a wooden structure that stood the test of time, but in many cases the construction was in stone resulting in galleries of great development, which in some cases were true works of art.

The porticos were reminiscent of the narthex of the Latin basilicas. It formed an advanced body over the central part of the main façade and if this façade had towers then it occupied the space between them, as in the [[Portico of Glory]] in Santiago de Compostela cathedral. At other times it occupied the entire front, forming a covered space that was called a "Galilee".

===Rose windows===
[[Rose window]]s are circular windows made of stone, whose origin is in the Roman [[oculus]] of the basilicas. In Spain these rose windows were employed from the eleventh century. Throughout the Romanesque, rose windows became important and increased in size, culminating in the Gothic era, which produced some of the most beautiful and spectacular specimens.

==Cloisters==
[[File:Valladolid monasterio Valbuena claustro lou.jpg|thumb|Romanesque cloister in the [[Santa María de Valbuena]] monastery, [[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]].]]
The [[cloister]] is an architectural unit usually built next to cathedrals and monastic churches, attached to the north or south. The cloister par excellence is the one promulgated by the Benedictine monks. The different units of the cloister, hinged on all four sides of a square courtyard, were dedicated to the service of the life of the community. In Spanish Romanesque many cloisters have been preserved, especially in the Catalan region.

==Civil and military architecture==
The Romanesque civil architecture is almost unheard of and most of the buildings that are considered to be from this period, are not, although some retain parts of the foundation or a door or semicircular window from the Romanesque era, their development and architectural design belong to more modern times.

===Civil buildings===
[[File:Cuellar palpedrocruel lou.jpg|thumb|Romanesque portal of the palace of [[Peter of Castile|Peter the Cruel]] in [[Cuéllar]].]]

Domestic buildings, including palaces, had no great pretensions. Houses were built of flimsy material (as opposed to the grandeur of the churches) and were unable to stand the test of time. When they wished to give importance to the civil architecture, the little that there was transformed and the new one was built with Gothic tendencies. So it was with the so-called Romanesque palace of [[Diego Gelmírez]] in [[Santiago de Compostela]], which is actually a totally Gothic factory, or buildings of Segovia [[sinecure]]s from the Middle Ages.

There is the famous palace of Dona Berenguela in the city of [[León, Spain|Leon]], called a Romanesque palace, but its structure and planning actually correspond to the last years of the late Middle Ages, far from Romanesque, though it retains (perhaps from outside the original location) some Romanesque windows. There is also, in [[Cuéllar]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Palace of Peter of Castile|es|3=Palacio de Pedro I el Cruel (Cuéllar)|lt=Palace of Peter the Cruel}}, the origin of which is supposed to date from the time of the ''[[Repoblación]]''. Maybe part of its foundations are Romanesque, but the current building is from the early fourteenth century, even though it has a Romanesque portal that was perhaps inherited from the previous building or reused from another. This palace is however considered as one of the few examples of civil Romanesque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=José Luis Cano de Gardoqui García |title= ''Casas y palacios de Castilla y León'' (Houses and palaces of Castille and Leon) (section on Segovia) |publisher=Junta de Castilla y León |year=2002 |ISBN= 84-9718-090-9 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bango Torviso, Isidro G. |title=Historia del Arte de Castilla y León (History of the Art of Leon and Castile) |volume= II |work= Arte Románico |page=39 |publisher= Ámbito Ediciones |location= Valladolid |year=1994 |ISBN=84-8183-002-X |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, buildings that have a good portal with a semicircular arch and large segments have been called "Romanesque" houses or palaces, but they are actually structures from the Gothic era.

An example of what could be a Romanesque palace built in stone is seen in the façade of the [[Palacio de los Reyes de Navarra, Estella|Palace of the Kings of Navarre]] in [[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]], [[Navarre]].

'''Siega Verde''' ({{IPA-es|ˈsjeɣa ˈβeɾðe}}) is an archaeological site in Serranillo, [[Villar de la Yegua]], [[province of Salamanca]], in [[Castile and León]], [[Spain]]. It was added to the [[Côa Valley Paleolithic Art]] site in the [[World Heritage List]] in 2010.

The site consists of a series of [[rock art|rock carving]]s, discovered in 1988 by professors Manuel Santoja, during an inventory campaign of archaeological sites in the valley of the [[Águeda River (Douro)|Águeda river]]. Subjects include equids, aurochs, deer and goats, among the most common ones, as well as bison, reindeer and the [[woolly rhinoceros]], which were not yet extinct at the time. 

The engravings date to the [[Gravettian]] culture of the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] (circa 20,000 years ago). There are also more recent, anthropomorphic representations, dating to the [[Magdalenian]] age (c. 9,000 years ago). There is a total of 91 panels, spanning some 1 kilometers of rock.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11645">'''''The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham''''' is a series of volumes which, when complete, will form a definitive edition of the writings of the philosopher and reformer [[Jeremy Bentham]] (1748–1832). It includes texts which Bentham published (or which were published in his name) during his lifetime; and also the many texts which remained unpublished at his death, and which exist only in manuscript.

==Scope and history==
The ''Collected Works'' is intended to supersede the 11-volume ''The Works of Jeremy Bentham'' (1838–1843), edited by Bentham's friend and [[literary executor]], [[John Bowring]], which is now considered to be flawed in many points of detail, and which omits Bentham's writings on religion; and also the 3-volume ''Jeremy Bentham's Economic Writings'' (1952–54) edited by [[Werner Stark]], which has likewise been subject to criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Philip |last=Schofield |title=Werner Stark and Jeremy Bentham's Economic Writings |journal=History of European Ideas |volume=35 |year=2009 |pages=475–494 |doi=10.1016/j.histeuroideas.2009.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is being published under the auspices of the Bentham Project at [[University College London]], whose library holds the majority of Bentham's surviving manuscripts. Since 2010 the Project has also run [[Transcribe Bentham]], a project for transcribing Bentham's manuscripts through [[crowdsourcing]], the output of which is intended, once edited, to appear in future ''Collected Works'' volumes. 

The Bentham Project is governed by the Bentham Committee, which was established in 1959. The first volume in the ''Collected Works'' appeared in 1968, and to date 33 volumes have been published of a projected total of 80. The series was published from 1968 until 1981 by the [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Athlone Press]] (the [[University of London]]'s publishing house); and since 1983 by [[Oxford University Press]] under its Clarendon Press imprint.

==General Editors==
The General Editors of the series have been: J. H. Burns (1961–79); J. R. Dinwiddy (1977–83); Fred Rosen (1983–94); Fred Rosen and Philip Schofield (1995–2003); and Philip Schofield (2003–date).

==Published volumes==
The series divides into two sequences, the ''Correspondence'' (of which 12 volumes have appeared of an eventual 14); and the ''Works''. The ''Works'' volumes are not sequentially  numbered. 

Those volumes which have been published to date are as follows:

'''''The Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas''''' is a book by the Finnish philosopher [[Edvard Westermarck]], published between 1906 and 1908. One of his main works,&lt;ref name="Pojman"&gt;[[#Poj99|Pojman 1999]]. p. 970.&lt;/ref&gt; it is a monumental study and a classic in its field, though now antiquated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hin95|Hintikka 2005]]. p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

Westermarck, in the preface to ''The Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas'', describes the background to his work. Having concluded that there is a close connection between moral opinions and religious beliefs, he decided to acquire first-hand knowledge of the folklore of a non-European people, and to that end spent four years in [[Morocco]] collecting anthropological data, familiarizing himself with the native way of thinking, and gaining an understanding of local customs. He was also indebted to British science and thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wes06|Westermarck 1906]]. p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his introduction, Westermarck asks why different cultures have different moral views.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wes06|Westermarck 1906]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the book, he attacks the idea that moral principles express objective value.&lt;ref name="Pojman" /&gt;

==Reception==
Wainwright Churchill criticizes Westermarck's claim that the Greeks of the Homeric era were unaware of or repudiated [[pederasty]], citing the contrary view of classical scholar Hans Licht.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chu67|Churchill 1967]]. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Westermarck's use of the expression "homosexual love" has been given as an early example of the use of the word "homosexual" in English. The classicist [[David M. Halperin]] writes in ''[[One Hundred Years of Homosexuality]]'' (1990) that Westermarck's book formed part of a trend to interpret Greek sexual conventions in an anthropological and ethological context, an approach that contrasts with earlier scholarly studies that proceeded from the assumption that classical Greek society was virtually unique in its acceptance of pederasty.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hal90|Halperin 1990]]. pp. 54, 158, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Time translation symmetry''' or '''temporal translation symmetry''' ('''TTS''') is a [[mathematical transformation]] in [[physics]] that moves the times of events through a common interval. Time translation symmetry is the hypothesis that the [[laws of physics]] are unchanged, (i.e. invariant) under such a transformation. Time translation symmetry is a rigorous way to formulate the idea that the laws of physics are the same throughout history. Time translation symmetry is closely connected via the [[Noether theorem]], to [[conservation of energy]].&lt;ref name=Wilczek&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilczek|first1=Frank|title=A Beautiful Question: Finding Nature's Deep Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oh3ICAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=16 July 2015|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-1-84614-702-9|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mathematics, the set of all time translations on a given system form a [[Lie group]].

There are many symmetries in nature besides time translation, such as [[Translational symmetry|spatial translation]] or [[rotational symmetries]]. These symmetries can be broken and explain diverse phenomena such as [[crystals]], [[superconductivity]], and the [[Higgs mechanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richerme|first1=Phil|title=Viewpoint: How to Create a Time Crystal|url=http://physics.aps.org/articles/v10/5|website=physics.aps.org|publisher=APS Physics|archiveurl=https://archive.is/eXKGV|archivedate=2 Feb 2017|date=18 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was thought until very recently that time translation symmetry could not be broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Else|first1=Dominic V.|last2=Bauer|first2=Bela|last3=Nayak|first3=Chetan|title=Floquet Time Crystals|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=117|issue=9|year=2016|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.090402|arxiv=1603.08001v4|bibcode=2016PhRvL.117i0402E|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08001v4.pdf|pmid=27610834|page=090402}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time crystals]], a state of matter first observed in 2017, break time translation symmetry.&lt;ref name=Gibney/&gt;

==Overview==
{{Lie groups}}
[[Symmetry (physics)|Symmetries]] are of prime importance in physics and are closely related to the hypothesis that certain physical quantities are only relative and [[unobservable]].&lt;ref name=feng&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feng|first1=Duan|last2=Jin|first2=Guojun|title=Introduction to Condensed Matter Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-iuYN5arHwoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|location=singapore|isbn=978-981-238-711-0|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symmetries apply to the equations that govern the physical laws (e.g. to a [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] or [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]) rather than the initial conditions, values or magnitudes of the equations themselves and state that the laws remain unchanged under a transformation.&lt;ref name=Wilczek/&gt; If a symmetry is preserved under a transformation it is said to be ''invariant''.

===Newtonian mechanics===

To formally describe time translation symmetry we say the equations, or laws, that describe a system at times &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; t + \tau&lt;/math&gt; are the same for any value of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, considering Newton's equation:

: &lt;math&gt;m\ddot{x}=-\frac{dV}{dx}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

One finds for its solutions &lt;math&gt;x=x(t)&lt;/math&gt; the combination:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}(t)^2 + V(x(t))&lt;/math&gt;

does not depend on the variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Of course, this quantity describes the total energy whose conservation is due to the time translation invariance of the equation of motion. By studying the composition of symmetry transformations, e.g. of geometric objects, one reaches the conclusion that they form a group and, more specifically, a [[Lie algebra|Lie transformation group]] if one considers continuous, finite symmetry transformations. Different symmetries form different groups with different geometries. Time independent Hamiltonian systems form a group of time translations that is described by the non-compact, [[Abelian group|abelian]], [[Lie group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. TTS is therefore a dynamical or Hamiltonian dependent symmetry rather than a kinematical symmetry which would be the same for the entire set of Hamiltonians at issue. Other examples can be seen in the study of [[time evolution]] equations of classical and quantum physics.

Many [[differential equations]] describing time evolution equations are expressions of invariants associated to some [[Lie group]] and the theory of these groups provides a unifying viewpoint for the study of all special functions and all their properties. In fact, [[Sophus Lie]] invented the theory of Lie groups when studying the symmetries of differential equations. The integration of a (partial) differential equation by the method of separation of variables or by Lie algebraic methods is intimately connected with the existence of symmetries. For example, the exact solubility of the [[Schrodinger equation]] in quantum mechanics can be traced back to the underlying invariances. In the latter case, the investigation of symmetries allows for an interpretation of the [[Quantum degeneracy|degeneracies]], where different configurations to have the same energy, which generally occur in the energy spectrum of quantum systems. Continuous symmetries in physics are often formulated in terms of infinitesimal rather than finite transformations, i.e. one considers the [[Lie algebra]] rather than the Lie group of transformations

===Quantum mechanics===
{{main article|Operator (physics)|Translation operator (quantum mechanics)|Energy operator|Symmetry in quantum mechanics}}
The invariance of a Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt; of an isolated system under time translation implies its energy does not change with the passage of time. Conservation of energy implies, according to the Heisenberg equations of motion, that &lt;math&gt;[ \hat{H}, \hat{H} ]=0&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;[ e^{i\hat{H}t/\hbar}, \hat{H} ]=0&lt;/math&gt;

or:

:  &lt;math&gt;[ \hat{T}(t), \hat{H} ]=0&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\hat{T}(t)=e^{i\hat{H}t/\hbar}&lt;/math&gt; is the time translation operator which implies invariance of the Hamiltonian under the time translation operation and leads to the conservation of energy.

===Nonlinear systems===
In many nonlinear field theories like [[general relativity]] or [[Yang-Mills theory|Yang-Mills theories]], the basic field equations are highly nonlinear and exact solutions are only known for ‘sufficiently symmetric’ distributions of matter (e.g. rotationally or axially symmetric configurations). Time translation symmetry is guaranteed only in [[spacetimes]] where the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] is static: that is, where there is a coordinate system in which the metric coefficients contain no time variable. Many [[general relativity]] systems are not static in any frame of reference so no conserved energy can be defined.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3662">[[File:Mann Von Hirschlanden.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A copy of the Hirschlanden warrior, on display at the findspot.]]
The '''''Warrior of Hirschlanden''''' (''Krieger von Hirschlanden'' in German) is a [[statue]] of a nude [[phallic symbol|ithyphallic]] [[warrior]] made of [[sandstone]], the oldest known [[Iron Age]] life-size anthropomorphic statue north of the Alps. It was a production of the [[Hallstatt culture]], probably dating to the 6th century BC. It is now in the [[Landesmuseum Württemberg|Württembergisches Landesmuseum]] in [[Stuttgart]], with a copy at the Hirschlanden site (now [[Ditzingen]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]), where it was found. The preserved height is 1.50 m, but the feet have been broken off.

==Description==
The warrior wears a [[torc]] (neck-ring), a belt with a typical late Hallstatt dagger, and a pointed hat, possibly made (as with the real hat in the princely grave of [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave|Hochdorf]]) of birchbark.

While the legs are modelled with some realism, the upper body is rather schematic and the face is extremely sketchy, leading to speculation that the man might be intended to be seen as wearing a mask, as is known from burials in Klein-Klein, Styria, Austria, [[Trebeništa]] (Macedonia) and the much earlier shaft-graves of [[Mycenae]], ca. 1500 BC.

The statue shows significant weathering, suggesting that it stood exposed to the elements for a long time before being buried.  Other anthropomorphic statues of the early Iron Age have been found in Rottenburg, Tübingen, Stammheim and Stockach (all Baden-Württemberg, Germany), but they are far more stylised, more carving than statue.  In the following [[La Tène period]], anthropomorphic statues are still very rare, but examples include the finds from [[Glauberg]] (Hessen, Germany), Holzgerlingen (Baden-Württemberg, Germany), the [[Mšecké Žehrovice Head]] (Bohemia), and the sculptures at [[Roquepertuse]].

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] influence (''[[Kouros|kouroi]]'') has been discussed. Numerous black figure vessels from fortified settlements of the period attest trading contacts with the Mediterranean, probably via the [[Rhône River]] and the Greek colony of [[Marseilles|Massilia]] ([[Marseille]]). Much closer stylistic connections exist with the far more elaborate statues from [[Capestrano]], Picenium, [[Italy]] (650-550 BC) and Casale Marittimo (middle of the 7th century).

==History==
The statue was found in Hirschlanden (now [[Ditzingen]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]) in 1963 when a low [[tumulus|barrow]] was excavated. The barrow was surrounded by a [[stone circle]] and a [[dry stone wall]]. It contained 16 burials, ranging from the very beginning of the Iron Age (Hallstatt D1, ca. 600 BC) to the beginning of the Late Iron Age ([[La Tène culture|La Tène]] period, ca. 450 BC). The statue was found north of the barrow, but is supposed to have been originally placed on the top.
