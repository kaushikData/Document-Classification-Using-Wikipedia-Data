[[File:Strassenbahn Altdorf-Flüelen 1906.jpg|thumb|Share of the Strassenbahn Altdorf-Flüelen AG, issued 1. February 1906]]
The '''Altdorf–Flüelen tramway''' ({{lang-de|Strassenbahn Altdorf–Flüelen}}, AF) was a [[metre gauge]] electric [[tram]]way in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[canton of Uri]]. It linked the town of [[Altdorf, Uri|Altdorf]] with [[Flüelen]], terminating adjacent to [[Flüelen railway station|Flüelen station]] on the [[Gotthard railway]].&lt;ref name=saw23&gt;{{cite book | title = Eisenbahnatlas Schweiz | year = 2012 | publisher = Verlag Schweers+Wall GmbH | isbn=978-3-89494-130-7 | page = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ebaf&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eingestellte-bahnen.ch/636/19743.html | title = Altdorf–Flüelen | language = German | work = www.eingestellte-bahnen.ch | accessdate = 2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tramway was opened in 1906, and closed in 1951, being replaced by a bus service. The line was electrified at 600 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]]. It had a length of {{convert|3.1|km}}, with 7 stops, a maximum gradient of 3.1% and a minimum radius of {{convert|25|m}}.&lt;ref name=saw23/&gt;&lt;ref name=ebaf/&gt;

The only visible remains of line is the tram depot, on the outskirts of Altdorf. After closure of the tramway, this was used as a bus depot by the [[Auto AG Uri]] until they moved to new premises in 2009.&lt;ref name=ebaf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aagu.ch/unternehmen/geschichte.html | title =  Geschichte | language = German |trans-title=History | publisher = Auto AG Uri | accessdate = 2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Delphine Lannuzel''' is a [[sea ice]] [[biogeochemist]] and Senior Lecturer at the [[Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies]] (IMAS), [[University of Tasmania]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/imas/delphine-lannuzel|title=Delphine Lannuzel|website=www.utas.edu.au|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://acecrc.org.au/people/dr-delphine-lannuzel/|title=Dr Delphine Lannuzel|website=acecrc.org.au|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Lannuzel completed her undergraduate degree at the Institut Universitaire Européen de la Mer, [[Brest, France]] in 2001. In 2006, Lannuzel was awarded her PhD in [[Biogeochemistry]] of iron in the Antarctic sea ice environment from the [[Université libre de Bruxelles|Université Libre de Bruxelles]], Belgium.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Career and impact ==
Lannuzel was previously an [[Australian Research Council]] (ARC) Discovery Early Career Researcher at IMAS. Lannuzel’s research is in the study of trace metals in the sea ice environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/science/cool-science/2009/phytoplankton-let-us-breathe...|title=Phytoplankton let us breathe...|website=www.antarctica.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/3191797.htm|title=Catalyst: Iron Whales - ABC TV Science|website=www.abc.net.au|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iron and other trace element data generated from her research represented the first for the Antarctic [[pack ice]] zone. Her pioneering work highlighted the accumulation of trace element iron in sea ice and therefore the paramount importance of Antarctic sea ice to iron [[Biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical cycling]] in polar ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.notre-planete.info/actualites/actu_2326_sources_hydrothermales_fer.php|title=Les sources hydrothermales : une source insoupçonnée de fer dissous dans l'océan|last=|first=|date=2010|website=www.notre-planete.info|publisher=Notre Planete|trans-title=Hydrothermal vents: an unsuspected source of dissolved iron in the ocean|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and honors ==
In 2007 Lannuzel was awarded a [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research]] (SCAR) Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scar.org/fellowship/fellows|title=Fellows|last=Nash|first=Rosemary|website=www.scar.org|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 she was awarded both the [[University of Tasmania]] Vice Chancellor Award for Research Excellence and the [[Japan Society for the Promotion of Science]] Award.

'''''Emitaï''''' is a 1971 Senegalese [[drama film]] directed by [[Ousmane Sembène]].&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2007fall/sembene.html |title=Ousmane Sembene – In Memoriam |accessdate=24 December 2012 |work=harvard}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was entered into the [[7th Moscow International Film Festival]] where it won a Silver Prize.&lt;ref name="Moscow1971"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1971 |title=7th Moscow International Film Festival (1971) |accessdate=24 December 2012 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403094201/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1971 |archivedate=3 April 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is set in late [[World War II]], with the [[Vichy government]] conscripting men from France's colonies. A revolt breaks out in a [[Diola]] village where the women hide the rice crop harvest instead of submitting to the French tax. The resistance unfolds in the village simultaneous to the resistance fighting in metropolitan France. When the metropole is liberated, the Diola village sees portraits of [[Charles de Gaulle]] replacing posters of Vichy's [[Marshal Pétain]], but circumstances of the village remains unchanged.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hornaday|first1=Ann|title=Senegal films are eloquent Movies: Ousmane Sembene's powerful 'Emitai' and 'Ceddo' play at the Orpheum.|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-02-02/features/1998033013_1_ceddo-emitai-ousmane-sembene|accessdate=19 December 2016|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=February 2, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fuliiru''' (Furiiru, Kifuliiru, Fulero) is a [[Great Lakes Bantu]] language spoken by the [[Fuliiru people|Fuliiru]] people (''Bafuliiru''), also known as the ''Fuliru'' or ''Fulero'', who live north and west of the town of [[Uvira]] in Uvira Territory, [[South Kivu]] province in the far eastern part of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. It is closely related to [[Kinyindu]].&lt;ref name="Van Otterloo 1"/&gt;

|
|}

Several sounds change when preceded by a nasal: voiceless sounds become voiced, and /β/ and /h/ are realized as [b].

The phoneme /n/ assimilates to the place of consonants that follow it: it can be realized as [m], [ɱ], [n], [ɲ], or [ŋ].

The phoneme /l/ is realized as [d] after /n/, as [ɾ] after the front vowels /e/ and /i/, and as [l] elsewhere. The phoneme /ɾ/ is likewise realized as [d] after /n/, but as [ɾ] elsewhere.

===Vowels===
The table below gives the vowel sounds of Fuliiru.&lt;ref name="Van Otterloo 1"/&gt;

|}

All five vowels occur in [[long vowel|long]] and [[short vowel|short]] forms, a distinction that is [[phoneme|phonemically distinctive]]. The [[vowel quality|quality]] of a vowel is not affected by its length.

===Tone===
Like most Bantu languages, Fuliiru is [[tonal language|tonal]], with a two-way contrast between high and low tones. Morphemes can be underlyingly high (H), low (L), or toneless. Phonetically, high, low, mid, and falling tones can all occur; mid tones are the realization of an underlying LH sequence, and falling tones are the realization of an underlying HL sequence or an utterance-final H tone.

The range of processes of dissemination and harmonization resulting in development of a common European culture can be summarized under the term of ''[[Europeanisation]]''.&lt;ref name=schmale&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmale|first=W.|title=Processes in Europeanization|url=http://www.ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/backgrounds/europeanization|work=European History Online|accessdate=16 May 2011|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europeanisation appears at both, national and regional level and is determined by different types of adaptation pressures and "mediating" institutions operating within different actors (bodies) of governance.&lt;ref name=marshall&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Marshall|first=Adam | title = Europeanization at the urban level: Local actors, institutions and the dynamics of multi-level interaction | journal = [[Journal of European Public Policy]] | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 668–686 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13501760500160292 | date = August 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501760500160292 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europeanisation emphasizes the involvement of local framework, development of more urban partnerships and encouragement of wider level of actors in multilevel territorial interaction.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt; 

''[[Governance]]'' is a process of involvement and coordination between different bodies to work together and address various challenges.&lt;ref name=evans/&gt; Within the governance network the state does not enter anymore as a main "regulator and policy maker" but more often, recently as one of the stakeholders involved in the process. 
Europeanisation in cities occurs as a consequence of intensive political and economical interactions between actors at every territorial level and it can be distinguished by two different streams:

*Download Europeanisation – characterised by changes in policies,  practices, participants within local systems of governance, arising from the negotiation and implementation of EU programmes,
*Upload Europeanisation – characterised by the transfer of innovative urban practices to the supra-national level, with an outcome of local initiatives in pan-European policies, or programmes.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt;

==Europeanisation==
===History of Europeanisation===

The Italian [[Renaissance]] generated a new cultural model, which was promising a modernisation and the European expansion, whilst the European cultural homogeneity should still had been maintained.&lt;ref name=schmale/&gt; Therefore, this specification was leading to such an outcome, that all countries on Atlantic coastline specialised mainly in trade, central Europe retained an urban – based commercial landscape, and Eastern Europe an apricultural perception.&lt;ref name=schmale/&gt; The early modern period was strongly characterized by contradictory processes of Europeanisation. Lately, the [[French Revolution]] contributed to an increase of this domain. Increasing effort to create a number of European institutions had not entirely followed the process of Europeanisation, although recently it is a relatively stable framework for states, as bodies and members of these institutions. 
The European Union as one of these institutions nowadays represents a modern level and a new quality of Europeanisation influencing the countries within the European Union.&lt;ref name=schmale/&gt;

===Europeanisation in British Cities===

In the UK, a significant shift of power to NGOs and private companies determinates the new implementation of policy by these actors. Local government and urban authorities are experiencing a significant decrease of influence and therefore, the public participation’s trust and involvement in decision processes is highly dependent on the cooperation with [[NGOs]] and their ability to provide a significant level of awareness. Central cities due to the shift of governance have been cut off from their “suburban hinterlands” and forced to implement narrower policies.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt; 
With an involvement of New Labour in 1997, the new urban regeneration programmes have been implemented into local level. Participation in EU Structural Fund programmes, the URBAN Community Initiative and Urban Pilot Projects has significantly contributed to a change of urban governance in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moulaert|first=F. |author2=Martinelli, F. |author3=Gonzales, S. |author4=Swyngedouw E.|title=Social Innovation and Governance in European Cities: Urban Development Between Path Dependency and Radical Innovation|journal=European Urban and Regional Studies|year=2007|volume=14|pages=195–209|doi=10.1177/0969776407077737 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0969776407077737 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK central government’s effort to retain absolute control over the Structural Funding has been determined by encouragement rather than prevention of further Europeanisation at the local level. Increasing level of Europeanisation in the UK has also a further origin in a connection between the central government with local actors, resulted in formation of new implications in terms of urban governance e.g. “european urban governance”. The centralization of local government is apparent in the weight of legislation directed at local authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sweeting|first=D.|title=Leadership in urban Governance: The Mayor of London|journal=Local Government Studies|year=2002|volume=28|issue=1|pages=3–20|doi=10.1080/714004134 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/714004134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The local authorities in cities such as Birmingham and Glasgow have participated and encouraged direct lobbying, long-term strategic programming and partnership, to liaise with conditions of The European Union Programme and to benefit from Structural Funding in terms of urban development.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt; This process can be described as “following the European strategies” in terms of urban governance. Internalisation of European Commission’s principles of programming occurs as one of the significant elements within urban local authorities when implementing the policy on European level.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt; Both cities have further developed strong transnational networks within Eastern Europe and strong relationship in terms of international cooperation and development programmes. Observation of their development released the evidence about the adaptation pressure arose from EU Structural Funds. The Europeanisation occurs here as an emerging process, thus a “steering regulator”, which the governments of these countries are more likely to follow than to regulate and govern.

==EU Cohesion Policy==

EU Cohesion Policy is a new reform programme which has been developed to assess and monitor the evaluation of Structural Funds and their outcome in lower developing regions. The new reform became one of the most intensively evaluated policies in Europe.&lt;ref name=bachtler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bachtler|first=J.|author2=Wren, C.|title=Evaluation of European Union Cohesion Policy: Research questions and policy challenges|journal=Regional Studies|year=2006|volume=40|issue=2 |pages=143–153 |doi=10.1080/00343400600600454 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00343400600600454}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contributors and assessors are policy makers and researchers from different range of disciplines. EU Cohesion Policy refers to the set of activities aimed to reduction of regional and social disparities in the [[European Union]]. Although, the EU Cohesion Policy appears as a relatively well designated programme, there are still some unresolved issues in terms of measurements, philosophical approaches and methods of Cohesion Policy evaluation. 

The further challenges such as different interests of European institutions and Member State governments occur as a main constraint. Cohesion Policy has been described as “political expression of solidarity” between Europe’s wealthier and poorer regions.&lt;ref name=bachtler/&gt; In terms of resolving the challenges, the EU Funding should be focused more on specialized areas of support, such as regional innovation networking, financial engineering, [[environmental sustainability]] and specialist advisory.&lt;ref name=bachtler/&gt; The better approach should be made not only in terms of accountability, but on capacity-building and learning objectives. Although, there is a direct influence from political actors to determine the policy, decisions processes, objectives and methods should be made within the partnership programme. The main objective of cohesion policy is to diminish the gap between different regions, more precisely between less-favored regions and affluent ones. It is an instrument of financial solidarity and a powerful force for economic integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Assembly of European Regions |title=Cohesion &amp; Regional Policy |url=http://www.aer.eu/main-issues/cohesion-regional-policy.html |accessdate=14 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722195430/http://www.aer.eu/main-issues/cohesion-regional-policy.html |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socio-economic disparities in European regions===

Socio-economic disparities in the European Union countries are considerable. Strong differences between neighboring regions create both, threats and opportunities. In terms of opportunities we understand goods, capital and labour in relatively closely defined regions; in the threats perspective it is mainly appearance of large differences between wealth and lagging regions. Described threats are highlighting the importance of geographical range (thus influence on socio-economic standards). In terms of economic development, disparities between European countries have been reduced over the last two decades, showing a clear “convergence” between the countries.&lt;ref name=eu&gt;{{cite web|last=European Parliament|title=Regional Disparities and Cohesion: What Strategies for the future|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/hearings/20070625/regi/study_en.pdf|accessdate=18 May 2011|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imbalances occurred particularly due to a large agglomeration, where geographically advanced regions play a significant role in growing [[GDP]]. Although poorer and more peripheral regions of the EU have shown a significant economic growth, in terms of the whole European economy they represent only a smart part of contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maloney|first=W.|author2=Smith, G. |author3=Stoker, G. |title=Social Capital and Urban Governance: Adding a More Contextualized ‘Top-Down’ Perspective|journal=Political Studies|year=2000|volume=48|issue=4|pages=802–820|doi=10.1111/1467-9248.00284 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9248.00284 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In rapidly growing economies such as Ireland, Estonia and Latvia regional differences lead to a positive outcome and relative decline in the more peripheral parts. Socio-economic differences due to regional disadvantage occur particularly in Finland, France and Spain, where the high unemployment rate has increased in more peripheral regions.&lt;ref name=eu/&gt;
Migration into rapidly growing areas seems in most European countries as an emerging issue.

===Spatial disparities in European Regions===

The increase in intra-national regional disparities is experienced by almost all the [[European Union|EU-27]] Member States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=John|first=P.|title=Local Governance in Western Europe|year=2001|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd.|location=London|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mapping potential accessibility to European GDP makes it possible to identify the areas well positioned to develop “hub functions”, by acting as "businesses and entrepreneurial" crossroad. In the former [[EU-15]] countries the analysis confirms that the main cause of inequality is a dominance of the main  metropolitan areas, which are creating two or more imbalanced territories, such as Italy (North-South), Belgium (Flanders-Wallonia), Germany (West-East)  and Spain (North-East and South-West).&lt;ref name=eu/&gt; Geometrical coherence is an identifiable quality that ties the city together through form, and is an essential for the vitality of the urban fabric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salingaros|first=N.|title=Complexity and Urban Coherence|journal=Journal of Urban Design|year=2000|volume=5|pages=291–316|doi=10.1080/713683969 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713683969 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of geographical advantage, a major core area centered in the border regions of Southern Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia emerges as well as a key – centre in terms of accessibility around Prague, Bucharest, Budapest and Vienna.&lt;ref name=eu/&gt; 

Further disparities between urban and rural regions may have a detrimental impact on the perspectives in terms of sustainable growth and GDP. Infrastructure investments may extend the labor market and decrease structural disadvantages within the country; however, their effectiveness depends on their investment design and main objective. Huge territorial imbalances between metropolitan areas and their surrounding regions are highlighting the strong polarization of the European territory.&lt;ref name=eu/&gt;

===EEA Grants and Norway Grants===

The [[EEA Grants]] and Norway Grants are Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway’s contribution to reducing economic and social disparities in European Economic Area and to the strengthening of bilateral relations with the 15 beneficiary states in Central and Southern Europe.&lt;ref name=eea&gt;{{cite web|last=EEA Grants |title=EEA Grants - Norway Grants |url=http://eeagrants.org/id/2305 |accessdate=18 May 2011 |year=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522065550/http://www.eeagrants.org/id/2305 |archivedate=22 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three countries have provided the financial support in terms of social and economic imbalances since 1994 and both grants initiatives were established in connection with the historic enlargement of the European Union and European Economic Area in 2004.&lt;ref name=eea/&gt; Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway agreed on joint management of the EEA Grants and Norway Grants; however, the decision-making procedure regarding the EEA Grants lies in hands of the Financial Mechanism Committee, whereas the Norway Grants are being managed by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The EEA Grants and Norway Grants are administered by the Financial Mechanism Office (FMO) in Brussels. A National Focal Point is the coordinating authority and contact point for each of the beneficiary states. More than one fourth of the EEA Grants was awarded to projects in the fields of environmental protection and sustainable development.

==Urban Governance==

''Urban Governance'' is a combined effort of multitude actors at a different level of government, non-governmental organizations, the private sector and community. Vertical partnership between national, regional and local governments must be complemented by horizontal partnership of stakeholders within cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hidden Cities |title=Unmasking and Overcoming Health Inequities in Urban Settings. Urban Governance for Reducing Health Inequities. |url=http://www.hiddencities.org/downloads/ch6_WHO_UN-HABITAT_Hidden_Cities.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128194716/http://www.hiddencities.org/downloads/ch6_WHO_UN-HABITAT_Hidden_Cities.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 November 2010 |work=Chapter 6 |accessdate=16 May 2011 |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Local authorities and government play significantly important role in land use development, community development and social services. 
The Urban governance in European countries is characterised by its diversity due to spatial and urban disparities. In cities of southern Europe a high level of centralized decisions is jeopardizing a successful outcome of the policy. Importance of the examination of local level political processes, determined by the local political and social infrastructure is an important tool for successful urban governance.&lt;ref name=chori&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chorianopoulos|first=I.|title=Urban Restructuring and Governance: North – South Differences in Europe and the EU URBAN Initiative|journal=Urban Studies|year=2001|volume=39|issue=4|pages=705–726|doi=10.1080/00420980220119534 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00420980220119534 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The north European regions’ post-war welfare has been described as a consequence of extensive urban planning policies and centrally defined responsibilities for local authorities, whereas the southern regions interpret a presence of indigenous small and medium-sized firms dominated the organisation of industry.&lt;ref name=chori/&gt; A significantly lower level of urban development appears in the south, while increase in entrepreneurial activities as a “part of urban development” occurs in northern parts. Urban governance in southern European regions is determined by institutional and territorial decentralisation and a week participation in urban development programmes.

Lack of transparency and accountability within governance networks in south European areas increasingly blurs the distinction between the state, NGOs, private companies and public sector.&lt;ref name=evans&gt;{{cite book | last = Evans | first = James | title = Environmental governance | publisher = Routledge | location = Milton Park Abingdon, Oxon New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780415589826 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and functions of the governmental organizations are often highly fragmented and therefore, these might be overlapping powers and responsibilities. Secondly, the community response in southern European states is less included in decision-making processes, either in variety of consultations with stakeholders, or in assessments of environmental impacts and management processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fainstein|first=S.|title=Competitiveness, Cohesion, and Governance: Their Implications for Social Justice|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2001|volume=25|issue=4 |pages=884–888 |doi=10.1111/1468-2427.00349 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-2427.00349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Political will is significantly important for successful process of urban governance, as changing the political environment has a great impact on voluntary and community activity. The more closer is the connection between ‘real communities’ in regions, cities, neighborhoods and government bodies, the more sensitive will be addressing the issues on local and regional level, and more successful the implementation of the policy.
Urban governance is hence, not a tool to retain a control over the increasing challenges, but ability to successfully manage and regulate the differences and to be creative in urban areas where the changes are most visible.

===Urban Policy===

In 2007, in European Union, ministers adopted the Leipzig Charter&lt;ref name=EUKN&gt;{{cite web|last=European Urban Knowledge Network |title=Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities |url=http://www.eukn.org/E_library/Urban_Policy/Leipzig_Charter_on_Sustainable_European_Cities |accessdate=16 May 2011 |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722164916/http://www.eukn.org/E_library/Urban_Policy/Leipzig_Charter_on_Sustainable_European_Cities |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve the objective of sustainable cities and recognise the importance of social, cultural and economic role that cities play.

The key policy document is building on the results of the previous presidencies, in particular:

*The Lille Action Programme (2000),
*The Urban Acquis (2004)
*The Bristol Accord (2005).&lt;ref name=min&gt;{{cite web|last=Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development |title=Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities |url=http://www.bmvbs.de/SharedDocs/EN/Artikel/IR/lepizig-charter.html |accessdate=13 May 2011 |year=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830233040/http://www.bmvbs.de/SharedDocs/EN/Artikel/IR/lepizig-charter.html |archivedate=30 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

European cities (and metropolitan regions) by signing the Leipzig Charter had acceded into conditions to draw up integral development plans,&lt;ref name=EUKN/&gt; whereas the local authorities had taken responsibility to implement these plans.

The Leipzig Charter contains two key policy messages:
*Integrated urban development should be applied through Europe and, the appropriate framework should be established at national and European level in order to be successful,
*Deprived urban neighbourhoods must increasingly receive political attention within the scope of an integrated urban development policy.&lt;ref name=min/&gt;

==Local governance and NGOs in European regions==

Networks, as today's “panacea” for environmental governance&lt;ref name=evans/&gt; occurs as an important driver for implementing certain policies. NGOs are significantly influencing public participation's involvement and on the other hand, they step in where, there is a “gap” that governments or companies are unable to fill.&lt;ref name=evans/&gt; Networks are playing an essential role in decision-making processes in terms of consultation to government or industries, regulating activities and sometimes even intervene, when substituting for traditional policies. NGOs can further act on behalf of their members, or as a significant political pressure group in their own right.&lt;ref name=evans/&gt;

The most addressing reason for shifting the urban governance into local and institutional networks is [[economic globalization]] and global spectacle, thus the emergence of worldwide institutions.&lt;ref name=kearns&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kearns|first=A.|author2=Paddison, R.|title=New Challenges for Urban Governance|journal=Urban Studies|year=2000|volume=37|issue=5-6|pages=845–850|doi=10.1080/00420980050011118 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00420980050011118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities as a key element of urban governance due to changes in political, social, spatial spheres and growing complexity of social life are trying to “delink” themselves from their national economies. City governments had to become more entrepreneurial and able to attract a business investments. New lifestyle and social differentiation appears as impossible to govern at one level and the governance response to these circumstances therefore includes new combinations of people-based and place-based policies.&lt;ref name=kearns/&gt; Community capacity-building remains a “cornerstone of area committee” and is likely to increase its appearance in the future.&lt;ref name=coaf&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coaffee|first=J.|author2=Healey, P.|title=My Voice: My Place’: Tracking Transformations in Urban Governance|journal=Urban Studies|year=2003|volume=40|issue=10|pages=1979–1999|doi=10.1080/0042098032000116077 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0042098032000116077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Institutional frameworks can influence positively to regional and urban challenges in terms of innovative processes. By institutions, institutionalists we understand rules, norms and practices which structure areas of social endeavour and not formal organisations, which focus on interactions and not decisions.&lt;ref name=coaf/&gt;
The way of governing has shifted from those of “hierarchies and [[bureaucracy]]” to selforganising networks of heterarchy.” &lt;ref name=kearns/&gt; Private firms are seeking more political engagement and want to achieve better functioning of urban and economic system. On the other hand, the state wants to influence firms to achieve better overall economic performance.
In the European Union the urban governance at the national scale requires except network influences and financial capital, sufficiency of knowledge for policy makers, otherwise “one solution model suitable to one region” does not necessarily guarantee successful outcome of the policy in the other region. The issue of multilevel governance in cities occurs in such cases when, the local governance activity “can mask the inefficiency” of social and political implementation policies to support and encourage citizens.
Another cause of urban governance shift is arising a social justice, greater consciousness of the diversity of basic needs and cultural identities, and a stronger awareness of environmental resource management and sustainability limits.&lt;ref name=coaf/&gt;

The Home Guard is a volunteer military organization offering a permanent state of readiness. The task of the Home Guard is to support the armed forces - nationally as well as internationally. In addition to this, the Home Guard supports the police, the emergency services, and other civilian authorities. The Home Guard contributes internationally with guard duty, build-up of military capacity, and support to civilian reconstruction. 

The Home Guard has a combined military and civilian leadership. The Commanding General of the Home Guard is responsible for the training and posting of units and managing the Home Guard. The Commissioner of the Home Guard is responsible for recruitment and the public support to the Home Guard in Denmark and general defence in the Danish community.

In times of tension and war the [[Defence Command (Denmark)|Danish Defence Command]] assume command over the activated Home Guard units.

Until 2014, the Home Guard Command was located at Generalstok in [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Kastellet]], in [[Copenhagen]]. It was then temporarily relocated to Søkvæsthuset in central Copenhagen. From August 2015, it will be placed at [[Vordingborg Barracks]].

'''"I Belong"''' is a song that served as the [[United Kingdom]]'s entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1965]]. Its music was written by singer [[Daniel Boone (singer)|Daniel Boone]] (credited under his real name, Peter Lee Sterling), and its lyrics were written by Phil Peters. It was performed at Eurovision by [[Kathy Kirby]], where it came in 2nd place, losing to [[Luxembourg]]'s "[[Poupée de cire, poupée de son]]", performed by [[France Gall]]. Kirby also recorded the song as a single, and it peaked on the music charts at No. 36 in Britain and No. 5 in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fygEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 |title=Billboard Magazine, May 1965 |accessdate=2013-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song tells of the joy of finding true love for the first time, after a string of bad relationships:
:But now my heart has recovered 
:From past affairs that turned wrong 
:All my dreams are uncovered
:I belong, I belong, I belong

The song was performed by Kirby at Eurovision 1965, held in [[Naples]] on 21 March 1965. The song was performed second on the night, following the [[Netherlands]] [['t Is genoeg]]" sung by [[Conny Vandenbos]] and preceding [[Spain]]´s [[¡Qué bueno, qué bueno!]]" sung by [[Conchita Bautista]] . By the close of voting, it had received 26 points, placing it 2nd in a field of 18.

Kathy Kirby also recorded a version of the song in [[Italian language|Italian]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3617">The '''International African Service Bureau''' ('''IASB''') was a [[Pan-Africanism|pan-African]] organisation founded in London in 1937 by [[West Indian]]s [[George Padmore]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Amy Ashwood Garvey]], [[T. Ras Makonnen]] and [[Kenya]]n nationalist [[Jomo Kenyatta]] and [[Sierra Leone]]an labour activist and agitator [[I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson]]. [[Chris Braithwaite]] (also known as Jones), was Secretary of this organisation.&lt;ref name="SD1973p446"&gt;{{Harvnb|Spitzer|Denzer|1973|p=446}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The bureau emerged from the [[International African Friends of Abyssinia]] ([[Ethiopia]]) and intended to address issues relating to Africa and the African diaspora to the British general public. Similar in design and organization to the [[West African Youth League]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Padmore|1957|p=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the IASB also sought to inform the public about the grievances faced by those in colonial Africa and created a list of desired reforms and freedoms that would help the colonies. The bureau also hoped to encourage new  African trade unions to affiliate themselves with the British labour movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=|first=|title=International African Services Bureau report for 1937|newspaper=|date=6 March 1938}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To further its interest, it held weekly meetings at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], where members discussed labor strikes in the [[Caribbean]] and [[Ethiopia]]. It also supplied speakers to branches of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], trade unions and the [[League of Nations Union]] and provided questions to be asked in front of Parliament regarding legislation, working conditions and trade union regulations.&lt;ref name="SD1973p448"&gt;{{Harvnb|Spitzer|Denzer|1973|p=448}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IASB journal, ''International African Opinion'', was edited by C. L. R. James.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Martin (professor)|Tony Martin]], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6h6UaOixnAgC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=International+African+Service+Bureau&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=by-cg4LiC0&amp;sig=pvZXkBZbB0Ug2y9pYyJEQ7p-aOQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo26yVtP_NAhXKDcAKHdKHBMIQ6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=International%20African%20Service%20Bureau&amp;f=false ''The Pan-African Connection: From Slavery to Garvey and Beyond''], The Majority Press, 1984, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation lasted until about 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marika Sherwood]], [http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/841 "Ending British Rule in Africa: Writers in a Common Cause"] (review), ''Reviews in History'', December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karen Heywood''' is a British [[Antarctic]] oceanographer best known for her work developing autonomous measurements of the [[Southern Ocean]].

==Early life and education==
Karen Heywood started her academic career with a BSc in Physics at [[University of Bristol]] followed by a Physical Oceanography CASE PhD studentship at the [[University of Southampton]] and former Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, looking at the [[Earth's energy budget|heat budgets]] of [[mixed layer]]s. Following this Heywood undertook a postdoc position at [[Bangor University]], working on [[eddies]] caused by flow around the [[Indian Ocean]] island of [[Aldabra]].

==Career and impact==
In 1989 Heywood arrived at the UEA for a lectureship in physical oceanography and was awarded a professorship in 2005, when she became the first female professor of oceanography in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tos.org/oceanography/assets/docs/27-4_supp_bios.pdf|title=Women in Oceanography: A Decade Later|last=|first=|date=|website=tos.org|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Heywood has trained more than 35 PhD students in a personal mission to increase the amount of observational oceanographers in the UK.

During the 1990s Heywood was heavily involved in the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), serving as Chief Scientist of the A23 WOCE hydrographic section from Antarctica to Brazil in 1995. This sparked a lasting interest in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean water masses and formation processes, and Heywood has since led several projects in polar regions developing and maintaining a close collaboration with the British Antarctic Survey team.

Heywood has led the field in using autonomous underwater gliders and is currently leading the UEA Seaglider group as well as providing community leadership in observational oceanography and autonomous ocean observing.  She was the UK’s first female physical oceanography Professor.

==Awards and honours==
Karen Heywood received the Georg Wüst Prize in 2009 for her work in the southern ocean.
Heywood was awarded The 2016 Challenger Medal in recognition of her major contribution to physical oceanography both in the UK and worldwide; particularly for her contribution to understanding physical oceanographic processes in the Antarctic, for her work in applying novel techniques to understanding ocean processes and for her wider work in developing UK marine science, particularly within SCOR (Scientific Committee for Oceanographic Research).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/challenger-conference-2016/keynote-speakers/karen-heywood|title=Prof. Karen Heywood - University of Liverpool|website=www.liverpool.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society for Underwater Technology presented its 2015 Oceanography Award to Heywood for her outstanding contribution to the field of oceanography.  In particular because she was an early advocate for the use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) as carriers of sensors and samplers in experiments. Her recent work on this topic has seen undersea gliders being used in the Antarctic, including under icebergs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sut.org/subsea-compression-innovator-presented-with-presidents-award-by-sut/|title=Subsea compression innovator presented with President’s Award by SUT|website=www.sut.org|publisher=Society for Underwater Technology|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karjalan veljeskunta''' (''Karelian Brotherhood'') was an organization founded in 1907 as a [[Russian Orthodox]] society, whose goal was to [[Russification|russify]] [[Karelia]]s orthodox population.

The chief of the organization was bishop [[Kyprianos]] (Kiprian). Karjalan veljeskunta was dissolved when [[Finland]] obtained its independence in 1917.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4739">The '''Kingdom of Ugu''' is a kingdom that exists in [[Nigeria]], in what is now [[Edo State]]. The Edo State is also called Benin, though it is not to be confused with the country. The Kingdom of Ugu originated out of the [[Benin Empire]] in Nigeria.

== Origin ==
"Sometime in the thirteenth century A.D., a period that was probably one of dynastic crisis and transition, The Ogiso dynasty collapsed due partly to internal feuds and the tyranny of Ogiso Owodo. Alongside [[Igodomigodo]] polity (later known as Benin) were Udo to the west and Iguobode in Iyekorhionmwon area to the east, and possibly other Edo-speaking polities. What immediately followed the collapse of Ogiso rulership was decentralized political authority. Many autonomous principalities emerged with leaders struggling to establish their own dynastic hegemony over surrounding areas. How long this situation lasted is not clear but oral historical sources and archaeological data soundly indicate that centralized political authority and a new kingship dynasty were re-installed in sections of Benin area during the thirteenth century. The name associated in oral traditions with this period of renewal is [[Eweka I]]. Yet, Eweka I's ambition to reunite the polity met with fierce opposition and competing claims. His success was limited as competing polities mushroomed around Benin area. Hence his son or grandson is even credited with establishing another polity known as Ugu in Iyekeorhionmwon, east of Benin and styled himself as [[Oba n'Ugu]] or king of Ugu."&lt;ref&gt;"Precolonial Nigeria: Essays in honor of Toyin Falola" Africa World Press. 2005. Retrieved January 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rightful heir and successor to [[Eweka I]], [[Prince Idu]] established himself as the king of Ugu after he lost the throne in Benin City due to manipulation orchestrated by the ''Uzama''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sub.uni-hamburg.de/opus/volltexte/2001/544/pdf/Disse.pdf "The Military System of Benin Kingdom, c.1440 - 1897 (page 21)".]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Osadolor, Osarhieme Benson. Department of Philosophy and History- University of Hamburg, Germany. 23 July 2001. Retrieved January 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oral Tradition ==
The foundation of the Kingdom of Ugu, with its capital at Umoghumwun has been traced to prince (sic) Idu, the eldest son of Oba Eweka I.&lt;ref&gt;["Evolution of Benin chieftaincy titles (pages 124-125)".] Eweka, E. B.&lt;/ref&gt; The Uzama who regulated and influenced succession to the throne did not accept Prince Idu as successor to the throne but favoured his younger brother Prince Uwakhuahen. The Uzama conspired and requested Prince Idu 'to provide a cow with a bird's nest built upon its head for the purpose of their father's royal funeral ceremonies.' The Prince was persuaded to go to Umoghunmwun, his mother's village to procure the cow. Meanwhile, 'his rival brother remained in Benin where a cow was procured and a bird's nest planted upon its horn', and 'the cow was then presented before the elders who immediately declared Uwakhuahen successor to the throne.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://sub.uni-hamburg.de/opus/volltexte/2001/544/pdf/Disse.pdf "The Military System of Benin Kingdom, c.1440 - 1897 (page 77-78)".]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Osadolor, Osarhieme Benson. Department of Philosophy and History- University of Hamburg, Germany. 23 July 2001. Retrieved January 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Uwakhuahen was crowned Oba, Prince Idu protested vigorously the attitude of the Benin elders towards him, and threatened to declare war. He had the sympathy of his mother's people and most elders in Iyehorhionmwon, who also vowed to go to war to avenge the injustice. Benin elders were panic-struck, and 'to appease Prince Idu, the kingdom was divided.'&lt;ref&gt;["Evolution of Benin chieftaincy titles (pages 124)".] Eweka, E. B.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole of south east was ceded to him. This was how the kingdom of Ugu was founded. Because the people were very warlike, the kingdom of Ugu rivalled Benin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sub.uni-hamburg.de/opus/volltexte/2001/544/pdf/Disse.pdf "The Military System of Benin Kingdom, c.1440 - 1897 (page 78)".]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Osadolor, Osarhieme Benson. Department of Philosophy and History- University of Hamburg, Germany. 23 July 2001. Retrieved January 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern Period ==
The Kingdom of Ugu still exists today and is still considered a kingdom in its own right. Descendants of the Ugu kingdom live in parts of Nigeria, Europe and the United States.

The '''Bakole''' ('''Bakolle''', '''Kole''') are an [[ethnic group]] of the [[Republic of Cameroon]]. They belong to the [[Sawa (ethnic group)|Sawa]], or Cameroonian coastal peoples. The Bakole speak a [[Bakole language|language of the same name]].

According to [[Duala people|Duala]] [[oral history]], the Duala, Bakole, and [[Limba people (Cameroon)|Limba]] come from a single ancestor named [[Ewale a Mbedi|Ewale]]. From Piti, northeast of [[Douala]], Ewale migrated to the coast to the east bank of [[Wouri River]]. The Bakole probably splintered from the Duala proper at some point and made their way west to their current territory.&lt;ref&gt;Fanso 49-52.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the inhabit the coast directly north of the [[Bamboko]] people, along the [[Rio Del Rey]] and south of the [[Meme estuary]] in the [[Ndian division]] of the [[Southwest Province (Cameroon)|Southwest Province]]. Today, the Bakole farm the fertile volcanic soils of [[Mount Cameroon]] to raise [[xanthosoma|cocoyam]]s, [[maize]], [[cassava|manioc]], [[oil palm]]s, and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s.

[[File:Duala ethnic groups.png|thumb|left|200px|Map showing the location of the various Duala ethnic groups of Cameroon]]
The [[Bakole language]] is part of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] group of the [[Niger–Congo language family]]. The language is at least partially intelligible with [[Kpwe language|Mokpwe]], the language of the [[Bakweri]]. Individuals who have attended school or lived in an urban centre usually speak [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]] or standard [[English language|English]]. In fact, growing numbers of [[Anglophone Cameroonian]]s today grow up with Pidgin as their first tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{ethnolink|wes|Cameroon Pidgin}} at ''Ethnologue''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The common theme in conspiracy theories about a New World Order is that a [[shadow government (conspiracy)|secretive]] [[power elite]] with a [[globalism|globalist]] agenda is [[list of conspiracies (political)|conspiring]] to eventually rule the world through an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] world government—which will replace [[sovereign state|sovereign]] [[nation state|nation-states]]—and an all-encompassing [[propaganda]] whose [[ideology]] hails the establishment of the New World Order as the [[Philosophy of history#Social evolutionism|culmination of history's progress]]. Many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been purported to be part of a [[cabal]] that operates through many [[front organizations]] to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing [[systemic risk|systemic crises]] to pushing through [[shock therapy (economics)|controversial policies]], at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination.&lt;ref name="Camp 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berlet and Lyons 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenster 2008"/&gt;

Before the early 1990s, New World Order [[conspiracism]] was limited to two American countercultures, primarily the [[Patriot movement|militantly anti-government right]] and secondarily that part of [[fundamentalist Christianity]] concerned with the [[end time|end-time]] emergence of the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name="New Internationalist 1 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Berlet, Chip|title=Interview: Michael Barkun|date=September 2004|url=http://www.publiceye.org/antisemitism/nw_barkun.html|accessdate=2009-10-01|authorlink=Chip Berlet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics such as [[Michael Barkun]] and [[Chip Berlet]] observed that [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] conspiracy theories about a New World Order had not only been embraced by many seekers of [[stigmatized knowledge]] but had seeped into [[popular culture]], thereby inaugurating a period during the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the United States where people are actively preparing for [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] [[millenarianism|millenarian]] scenarios.&lt;ref name="Berlet and Lyons 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt; Those political scientists are concerned that [[mass hysteria]] over New World Order conspiracy theories could eventually have devastating effects on American political life, ranging from escalating [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone-wolf terrorism]] to the rise to power of authoritarian ultranationalist [[demagogue]]s.&lt;ref name="Berlet and Lyons 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pete Williams|first1=Andrew Blankstein|title=Sources: Alleged LAX gunman had 'new world order' conspiracy tract|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/sources-alleged-lax-gunman-had-new-world-order-conspiracy-theory-f8C11514443|accessdate=10 July 2014|work=NBC News|date=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the term==
During the 20th century many [[politician]]s, such as [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Winston Churchill]], used the term "[[new world order (politics)|new world order]]" to refer to a new period of history characterised by a dramatic change in world political thought and in the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] after [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} They all saw the period as an opportunity to implement [[idealism (international relations)|idealistic]] proposals for [[global governance]] in the sense of new collective efforts to address worldwide problems that go beyond the capacity of individual [[nation state|nation-states]] to solve, while always respecting the right of nations to [[self-determination]]. These proposals led to the formation of international organizations (such as the [[United Nations|UN]] in 1945 and [[NATO]] in 1949), and international regimes (such as the [[Bretton Woods system]] (1944-1971) and the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT, 1947-1994)), which were calculated{{by whom|date=August 2016}} both to maintain a balance of power in favor of the United States and to regularize cooperation between nations, in order to achieve a [[ultra-imperialism|peaceful phase of capitalism]]. These creations in particular and [[International relations theory#Liberalism|liberal internationalism]] in general, however, were regularly criticized and opposed by American [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservative]] [[business nationalism|business nationalists]] from the 1930s on.&lt;ref name="Buchanan 1999"&gt;{{cite book|author= Buchanan, Patrick J.|title= A Republic, Not an Empire: Reclaiming America's Destiny|publisher= Regnery Publishing, Inc.|date= 1999|asin= B001NHW8GI | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=stgGsu74ui4C }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=August 2016}}

[[progressivism|Progressives]] welcomed these new international organizations and regimes in the aftermath of the two World Wars, but argued that they suffered from a [[democratic deficit]] and were therefore inadequate not only to prevent another [[global war]] but to foster [[global justice]]. The United Nations was always intended to remain a free association of sovereign nation-states, not a transition to democratic world government. Thus, activists around the globe formed a [[world federalist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Hughes|first1= J.|title= Better Living Through World Government: Transnationalism as 21st Socialism|url= http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/hughes1991worgov/|website= ''Institute for Ethics &amp; Emerging Technologies''|accessdate= 10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British writer and futurist [[H. G. Wells]] went further than progressives in the 1940s, by appropriating and redefining the term "new world order" as a synonym for the establishment of a technocratic [[world state]] and of a [[planned economy]].&lt;ref name="Wells 1940"&gt;{{cite book|author= Wells, H. G.|title= [[The New World Order (Wells)|The New World Order]]|publisher= Hesperides Press|date= 2006|isbn= 1-4067-2262-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the popularity of his ideas in some [[state socialism|state-socialist]] circles, Wells failed to exert a deeper and more lasting influence because he was unable to concentrate his energies on a direct appeal to the [[intelligentsia]]s who would ultimately have to coordinate a Wellsian new world order.&lt;ref name="Wagar 1977"&gt;{{cite book|author= Wagar, W. Warren|title= H. G. Wells and the World State|publisher= Ayer Co Pub|date= 1977|isbn= 0-8369-5915-9|authorlink= W. Warren Wagar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare of 1947–1957]], agitators of the American secular and [[Christian right]], influenced by the work of Canadian conspiracy theorist [[William Guy Carr]], increasingly embraced and spread unfounded fears of [[Freemasons]], [[Illuminati]] and [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jews]] as the alleged driving forces behind an "[[comintern|international communist]] conspiracy". The threat of "Godless communism", in the form of a [[state atheism|state atheistic]] and [[bureaucratic collectivism|bureaucratic collectivist]] world government, [[demonization|demonized]] as the "Red Menace", therefore became the focus of [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] [[millenarianism|millenarian]] [[conspiracism]]. The Red Scare came to shape one of the core ideas of the political right in the United States, which is that [[liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and [[progressivism in the United States|progressives]], with their [[welfare state|welfare-state]] policies and international cooperation programs such as [[United States foreign aid|foreign aid]], supposedly contribute to a gradual process of [[collectivism]] that will inevitably lead to nations being replaced with a [[world communism|communist one-world government]].&lt;ref name="Berlet 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Berlet|first1= Chip|title= Dances with Devils: How Apocalyptic and Millennialist Themes Influence Right Wing Scapegoating and Conspiracism|journal= The Public Eye|date= 15 April 1999|url= http://www.publiceye.org/apocalyptic/Dances_with_Devils_1.html|accessdate= 2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Right-wing populist]] advocacy groups with a [[paleoconservatism|paleoconservative]] world-view, such as the [[John Birch Society]], disseminated a multitude of conspiracy theories in the 1960s claiming that the governments of both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] were controlled by a [[cabal]] of [[neoliberalism|corporate internationalists]], greedy bankers and corrupt politicians who were intent on using the [[United Nations|U.N.]] as the vehicle to create a "One World Government". This right-wing [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalist]] conspiracism fuelled the Bircher campaign for [[United States withdrawal from the United Nations|US withdrawal from the UN]]. American writer Mary M. Davison, in her 1966 booklet ''The Profound Revolution'', traced the alleged New World Order conspiracy to the establishment of the US [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] in 1913 by international bankers, whom she claimed later formed the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in 1921 as a [[Shadow government (conspiracy)|shadow government]]. At the time the booklet was published, many readers would have interpreted "international bankers" as a reference to a postulated "international Jewish banking conspiracy" masterminded by the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]].&lt;ref name="Berlet 1999"/&gt;

Claiming that the term "New World Order" is used by a secretive elite dedicated to the destruction of all national sovereignties, American writer [[Gary Allen]]—in his books ''None Dare Call It Conspiracy'' (1971), ''Rockefeller: Campaigning for the New World Order'' (1974), and '' Say "No!" to the New World Order'' (1987)—articulated the anti-globalist theme of much current right-wing populist conspiracism in the US. Thus, after the [[revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] in the early 1990s, the main demonized [[scapegoat]] of the American [[far right]] shifted seamlessly from [[crypto-communism|crypto-communists]], who plotted on behalf of the Red Menace, to globalists, plotting on behalf of the New World Order. The relatively painless nature of the shift was due to growing right-wing populist [[business nationalism|opposition to corporate internationalism]], but also in part to the basic underlying apocalyptic millenarian paradigm, which fed the [[Cold War]] (ca 1947-1991) and the [[witch-hunts]] of the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy period]]&lt;ref name="Berlet 1999"/&gt; (1950s).

In his speech, ''[[s:Toward a New World Order|Toward a New World Order]]'', delivered on 11 September 1990 during a joint session of the [[United States Congress|US Congress]], President [[George H. W. Bush]] described [[New world order (politics)#The Gulf War and Bush's formulation|his objectives for post-Cold War global governance]] in cooperation with [[post-Soviet states]]. He stated:

{{quotation|Until now, the world we've known has been a world divided—a world of barbed wire and concrete block, conflict and cold war. Now, we can see a new world coming into view. A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order. In the words of Winston Churchill, a "world order" in which "the principles of justice and fair play ... protect the weak against the strong ..." A world where the United Nations, freed from cold war stalemate, is poised to fulfill the historic vision of its founders. A world in which freedom and respect for human rights find a home among all nations.&lt;ref&gt;(clip) {{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byxeOG_pZ1o |title= George Bush Sr. New World Order Live Speech Sept 11 1991 |date= 3 December 2011 |publisher= YouTube |access-date= 14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that progressives were denouncing this new world order as a rationalization of [[American imperialism|American imperial]] ambitions in the [[Middle East]], while [[conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] rejected any new security arrangements altogether and fulminated about any possibility of a UN revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= Judis|first1= John B.|title= George Bush, Meet Woodrow Wilson|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/20/opinion/george-bush-meet-woodrow-wilson.html|accessdate= 10 July 2014|work= The New York Times|date= 20 November 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chip Berlet]], an American investigative reporter specializing in the study of [[right-wing]] movements in the US, wrote that the Christian and secular hard right were especially terrified by the speech. Fundamentalist Christian groups interpreted Bush's words as signaling the [[End Times]], while secular theorists approached it from an anti-communist and anti-collectivist standpoint and feared for a hegemony over all countries by the United Nations.&lt;ref name="Berlet and Lyons 2000"/&gt;

[[File:Pat_Robertson_Paparazzo_Photography.jpg|thumb|upright|American televangelist [[Pat Robertson]] wrote the 1991 best-selling book ''[[The New World Order (Robertson)|The New World Order]]'']]
American televangelist [[Pat Robertson]], with his 1991 best-selling book ''[[The New World Order (Robertson)|The New World Order]]'', became the most prominent Christian popularizer of conspiracy theories about recent American history. He describes a scenario where [[Wall Street]], the Federal Reserve System, the Council on Foreign Relations, the [[Bilderberg Group]] and the [[Trilateral Commission]] control the flow of events from behind the scenes, nudging people constantly and covertly in the direction of world government for the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;

Observers note that the galvanizing of right-wing populist conspiracy theorists such as [[Linda Thompson (attorney)|Linda Thompson]], [[Mark Koernke]] and Robert K. Spear into militancy led to the rise{{when|date=August 2016}} of the [[militia movement]], which spread its [[Anti-statism|anti-government]] ideology through speeches at rallies and meetings, books and videotapes sold at [[gun show]]s, shortwave and satellite radio, fax networks and computer bulletin boards.&lt;ref name="Berlet 1999"/&gt;  However, it is overnight AM radio shows and [[viral marketing|viral propaganda]] on the Internet that have most effectively contributed to their [[extremism|extremist]] political ideas about the New World Order finding their way into the previously apolitical literature of numerous [[Kennedy assassinologist]]s, [[ufologist]]s, [[lost lands|lost land theorists]] and, most recently, [[occultist]]s.  From the mid–1990s on, the worldwide appeal of those subcultures transmitted New World Order conspiracism like a "[[Viruses of the Mind|mind virus]]" to a large new audience of seekers of [[stigmatized knowledge]].&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;

Hollywood [[conspiracy fiction|conspiracy-thriller]] television shows and films also played a role in introducing a vast popular audience to various [[fringe theory|fringe theories]] related to New World Order conspiracism—[[black helicopter]]s, [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] "concentration camps", etc.—theories which for decades previously were confined to [[Radical right (United States)|radical right-wing]] subcultures.  The 1993–2002 television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', the 1997 film ''[[Conspiracy Theory (film)|Conspiracy Theory]]'' and the 1998 film ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files: Fight the Future]]'' are often cited as notable examples.&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt; &lt;!-- Please do not add further examples unless they are noted as such by a reliable source (e.g., author, review, article [no blogs], etc.).

In 2009 American film directors [[Luke Meyer]] and [[Andrew Neel]] released ''[[New World Order (film)|New World Order]]'', a critically acclaimed documentary film which explores the world of conspiracy theorists—such as American radio host [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]]—who consistently expose and vigorously oppose what they perceive as an emerging New World Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= Monfette|first1= Christopher|title= SXSW 09: New World Order Review|url= http://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/03/16/sxsw-09-new-world-order-review|accessdate= 10 July 2014|work= ign.com|date= 16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right-wing populist agitators (such as Alex Jones) and [[hip hop music]]'s left-wing populist rappers (such as [[KRS-One]], [[Professor Griff]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] and [[Immortal Technique]]), thus illustrating how [[anti-elitism|anti-elitist]] conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose a political system.&lt;ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
There are numerous [[Conspiracy theory#Types|systemic conspiracy theories]] through which the concept of a New World Order is viewed.

Since the 19th century, many [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] [[millennialism|millennial]] [[Christian eschatology|Christian eschatologists]], starting with [[John Nelson Darby]], have predicted a globalist conspiracy to impose a tyrannical New World Order governing structure as the fulfillment of [[prophecies]] about the "[[end time]]" in the [[Bible]], specifically in the [[Book of Ezekiel]], the [[Book of Daniel]], the [[Olivet discourse]] found in the [[Synoptic Gospels]] and the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Richard T.|title=Revelation, Revolutions, and the Tyrannical New World Order|journal=The Huffington Post|date=24 February 2011|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-t-hughes/revolutions-in-the-middle_b_827201.html|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They claim that people who have made a [[deal with the Devil]] to gain wealth and power have become pawns in a supernatural chess game to move humanity into accepting a [[utopia]]n world government that rests on the spiritual foundations of a [[syncretism|syncretic]]-[[messianism|messianic]] world religion, which will later reveal itself to be a [[dystopia]]n world empire that imposes the [[imperial cult]] of an “Unholy Trinity” of [[Satan]], the [[Antichrist]] and the [[False Prophet]]. In many contemporary Christian conspiracy theories, the False Prophet will be either the last [[pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]] (groomed and installed by an [[Alta Vendita]] or [[Jesuit conspiracy theories|Jesuit conspiracy]]), a [[guru]] from the [[New Age movement]], or even the leader of an elite [[fundamentalist Christian]] organization like [[The Fellowship (Christian organization)|the Fellowship]], while the Antichrist will be either the [[President of the European Union]], the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], or even the [[Caliph]] of a [[Pan-Islamism|pan-Islamic]] state.&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes"/&gt;

Some of the most vocal critics of end-time conspiracy theories come from within Christianity.&lt;ref name="Berlet 1999"/&gt; In 1993, historian Bruce Barron wrote a stern rebuke of apocalyptic Christian conspiracism in the ''Christian Research Journal'', when reviewing [[Pat Robertson|Robertson]]'s 1991 book ''[[The New World Order (Robertson)|The New World Order]]''.&lt;ref name="Barron 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bruce, Barron |title=A Summary Critique.

Camp's 1997 book ''Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-Times Paranoia''.&lt;ref name="Camp 1997"/&gt; Religious studies scholar Richard T. Hughes argues that "New World Order" rhetoric libels the Christian faith, since the "New World Order" as defined by Christian conspiracy theorists has no basis in the Bible whatsoever.  Furthermore, he argues that not only is this idea unbiblical, it is positively anti-biblical and fundamentally [[anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]], because by misinterpreting key passages in the Book of Revelation, it turns a comforting message about the coming [[kingdom of God]] into one of fear, panic and despair in the face of an allegedly approaching one-world government.&lt;ref name="Hughes"/&gt; [[Progressive Christianity|Progressive Christians]], such as preacher-theologian [[Peter J.

===Freemasonry===
{{Main|Masonic conspiracy theories}}
[[Freemasonry]] is one of the world's oldest secular [[fraternity|fraternal organizations]] and arose during late 16th–early 17th century Britain.  Over the years a number of allegations and conspiracy theories have been directed towards Freemasonry, including the allegation that Freemasons have a hidden [[political agenda]] and are conspiring to bring about a New World Order, a world government organized according to Masonic principles or governed only by Freemasons.&lt;ref name="Berlet 1999"/&gt;

The [[esotericism|esoteric]] nature of [[Masonic symbolism]] and [[Masonic ritual and symbolism|rites]] led to Freemasons first being accused of secretly practising [[Satanism]] in the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="Berlet 1999"/&gt; The original allegation of a [[Masonic conspiracy theories|conspiracy within Freemasonry]] to subvert religions and governments in order to take over the world traces back to Scottish author [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]], whose [[reactionary]] conspiracy theories crossed the Atlantic and influenced outbreaks of Protestant [[anti-Masonry]] in the United States during the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Berlet 1999"/&gt;  In the 1890s, French writer [[Léo Taxil]] wrote a series of pamphlets and books denouncing Freemasonry and charging their lodges with worshiping [[Lucifer]] as the [[Supreme Being]] and [[Great Architect of the Universe]]. Despite the fact that Taxil admitted that [[Taxil hoax|his claims were all a hoax]], they were and still are believed and repeated by numerous conspiracy theorists and had a huge influence on subsequent anti-Masonic claims about Freemasonry.&lt;ref name="De Hoyos 2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=De Hoyos, Arturo|title=As it True What They Say About Freemasonry?|publisher=M. Evans and Company, revided edition|date=2011|isbn=1-59077-153-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conspiracy theorists eventually speculated that some [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], such as [[George Washington]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]], were having Masonic [[sacred geometry|sacred geometric]] designs interwoven into American society, particularly in the [[Great Seal of the United States]], the [[United States one-dollar bill]], the architecture of [[National Mall#Landmarks, museums and other features|National Mall landmarks]] and the [[streets and highways of Washington, D.C.]], as part of a master plan to create the first "Masonic government" as a model for the coming New World Order.&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;

[[File:Masonic lodge room, Salt Lake Masonic Temple.JPG|thumb|right|220 px|A [[Masonic Lodge]] room]]

Freemasons rebut these claims of a Masonic conspiracy. Freemasonry, which promotes [[rationalism]], places no power in occult symbols themselves, and it is not a part of its principles to view the drawing of symbols, no matter how large, as an act of consolidating or controlling power.&lt;ref name="AMFAQ 6.8"&gt;{{cite web|author=McKeown, Trevor W.|date=5 May 2004|url=http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/anti-masonry06.html#68|title=Doesn't the satanic design of Washington, DC’s street plan prove that there's a masonic conspiracy?|work=Anti-masonry Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon A.F. &amp; A.

Although the [[Continental Freemasonry|European continental branch of Freemasonry]] has organizations that allow political discussion within their Masonic Lodges, Masonic researcher Trevor W. McKeown argues that the accusations ignore several facts. Firstly, the many Grand Lodges are independent and sovereign, meaning they act on their own and do not have a common agenda. The points of belief of the various lodges often differ. Secondly, famous individual Freemasons have always held views that span the political spectrum and show no particular pattern or preference. As such, the term "Masonic government" is erroneous; there is no consensus among Freemasons about what an ideal government would look like.&lt;ref name="AM FAQ 4.8"&gt;{{cite web|author=McKeown, Trevor W.|date=5 May 2004|url=http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/anti-masonry04.html#politics|title=Does Freemasonry have a secret political agenda?|work=Anti-masonry Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon A.F. &amp; A.

===Illuminati===
[[File:Adam_Weishaupt01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adam Weishaupt]], founder of the [[Illuminati]], an 18th-century Bavarian liberal and secular secret society]]
The Order of the [[Illuminati]] was an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment-age]] secret society founded by university professor [[Adam Weishaupt]] on 1 May 1776, in [[Upper Bavaria]], Germany. The movement consisted of advocates of [[freethought]], [[secularism]], [[liberalism]], [[republicanism]], and [[gender equality]], recruited from the German [[Masonic Lodge]]s, who sought to teach [[rationalism]] through [[Western esotericism|mystery school]]s. In 1785, the order was infiltrated, broken up and suppressed by the government agents of [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria]], in his preemptive campaign to neutralize the threat of secret societies ever becoming hotbeds of conspiracies to overthrow the Bavarian [[monarchy]] and its [[state religion]], Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref name="Stauffer 1918"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stauffer, Vernon L.|title=The European Illuminati|work=New England and the Bavarian Illuminati|publisher=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon A.F. &amp; A. M.|date=1918|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/stauffer.html|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that the Bavarian Illuminati survived its suppression in 1785.&lt;ref name="McKeown"/&gt;

In the late 18th century, [[reactionary]] conspiracy theorists, such as Scottish physicist [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]] and French [[Jesuit]] priest [[Augustin Barruel]], began speculating that the Illuminati had survived their suppression and become the masterminds behind the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Reign of Terror]]. The Illuminati were accused of being [[subversion|subversives]] who were attempting to secretly orchestrate a [[revolutionary wave]] in [[Europe]] and the rest of the world in order to spread the most [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] ideas and movements of the Enlightenment—[[anti-clericalism]], [[anti-monarchism]], and [[protofeminism|anti-patriarchalism]]—and to create a world [[noocracy]] and [[Cult of Reason|cult of reason]]. During the 19th century, fear of an Illuminati conspiracy was a real concern of the European [[ruling class]]es, and their oppressive reactions to this unfounded fear provoked in 1848 [[revolutions of 1848|the very revolutions they sought to prevent]].&lt;ref name="McKeown"&gt;{{cite journal|author=McKeown, Trevor W.|title=A Bavarian Illuminati primer|date=2004|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/illuminati.html|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[interwar period]] of the 20th century, [[fascism|fascist]] propagandists, such as British revisionist historian [[Nesta Helen Webster]] and American socialite [[Edith Starr Miller]], not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed that it was a subversive secret society which served the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both [[finance capitalism]] and [[State ideology of the Soviet Union|Soviet communism]] in order to [[divide and rule]] the world. American evangelist [[Gerald Burton Winrod]] and other conspiracy theorists within the [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian]] movement in the United States—which emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment [[secular humanism]], [[modernism]], and liberalism—became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S.. [[right-wing populism|Right-wing populists]], such as members of the [[John Birch Society]], subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities ([[Skull and Bones]]), gentlemen's clubs ([[Bohemian Club]]), and think tanks ([[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[Trilateral Commission]]) of the [[American upper class]] are [[front organization]]s of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government.&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;

===''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion''===
''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' is an [[antisemitic canard]], originally published in [[Russian language|Russian]] in 1903, alleging a [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Judeo-Masonic conspiracy]] to achieve world domination. The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a [[cabal]] of Jewish masterminds, which has co-opted [[Freemasonry]] and is plotting to rule the world on behalf of all Jews because they believe themselves to be the [[Jews as a chosen people|chosen people of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Soviet Jewry: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organizations, United States Congress. House. Committee on Foreign Affairs. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 1984. p.&amp;nbsp;56&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Protocols'' incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the [[John Robison (physicist)|Robison]] and [[Augustin Barruel|Barruel]] attacks on the Freemasons, and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti-[[Tsarist autocracy|Tsarist]] movements in Russia. ''The Protocols'' reflect themes similar to more general [[Counter-Enlightenment|critiques of Enlightenment]] liberalism by [[traditionalist conservatism|conservative]] aristocrats who support [[monarchy|monarchies]] and [[state religion]]s. The interpretation intended by the publication of ''The Protocols'' is that if one peels away the layers of the [[Masonic conspiracy theories|Masonic conspiracy]], past the [[Illuminati]], one finds the rotten Jewish core.&lt;ref name="Berlet 1999"/&gt;

[[File:1920 The Jewish Peril - Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode Ltd - 1st ed..jpg|upright|thumb|Cover of a 1920 copy of ''[[The Jewish Peril]]'']]

Numerous polemicists, such as Irish journalist [[Philip Graves]] in a 1921 article in ''[[The Times]]'', and British academic [[Norman Cohn]] in his 1967 book ''[[Warrant for Genocide]]'', have proven ''The Protocols'' to be both a [[hoax]] and a clear case of plagiarism. There is general agreement that Russian-French writer and political activist [[Matvei Golovinski]] fabricated the text for [[Okhrana]], the [[secret police]] of the [[Russian Empire]], as a work of [[counter-revolutionary]] [[propaganda]] prior to the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], by plagiarizing, almost word for word in some passages, from ''[[The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu]]'', a 19th-century satire against [[Napoleon III of France]] written by French political satirist and [[Legitimism|Legitimist]] militant [[Maurice Joly]].&lt;ref name="Spargo 1921"&gt;{{cite book|author=Spargo, John|title=The Jew and American Ideals|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|date=1921|authorlink=John Spargo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsible for feeding many [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[anti-Masonry|anti-Masonic]] mass hysterias of the 20th century, ''The Protocols'' has been influential in the development of some conspiracy theories, including some New World Order theories, and appears repeatedly in certain contemporary conspiracy literature.&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt; For example, the authors of the 1982 controversial book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' concluded that ''The Protocols'' was the most persuasive piece of evidence for the existence and activities of the [[Priory of Sion]]. They speculated that this secret society was working behind the scenes to establish a [[theocracy|theocratic]] "[[United States of Europe]]". Politically and religiously unified through the [[imperial cult]] of a [[Merovingian]] [[Great Catholic Monarch|Great Monarch]]—supposedly descended from a [[Jesus bloodline]]—who occupies both the throne of Europe and the [[Holy See]], this "Holy European Empire" would become the [[hyperpower]] of the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1982"&gt;Henry Lincoln, Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'', Corgi, 1982. {{ISBN|0-552-12138-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Priory of Sion itself has been exhaustively [[debunker|debunked]] by journalists and scholars as a hoax,&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/27/60minutes/main1552009.shtml|title=The Priory Of Sion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; some [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] [[millenarianism|millenarian]] [[Christian eschatology|Christian eschatologists]] who believe ''The Protocols'' is authentic became convinced that the Priory of Sion was a fulfillment of [[prophecies]] found in the [[Book of Revelation]] and further proof of an [[Antichrist|anti-Christian]] conspiracy of epic proportions signaling the imminence of a New World Order.&lt;ref name="Aho on the Merovigians 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Aho, Barbara|title=The Merovingian Dynasty: Satanic Bloodline of the AntiChrist &amp; False Prophet|date=1997|url=http://watch.pair.com/merovingian.html|accessdate=2009-11-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212030333/http://watch.pair.com/merovingian.html|archivedate=2009-12-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics argue that the current gambit of contemporary conspiracy theorists who use ''The Protocols'' is to claim that they "really" come from some group other than the Jews, such as [[fallen angel]]s or [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Alien invasion|alien invaders]]. Although it is hard to determine whether the conspiracy-minded actually believe this or are simply trying to sanitize a discredited text, skeptics argue that it does not make much difference, since they leave the actual, antisemitic text unchanged. The result is to give ''The Protocols'' credibility and circulation.&lt;ref name="New Internationalist 1 2004"/&gt;

===Round Table===
During the second half of [[Britain's Imperial Century|Britain's "imperial century" between 1815 and 1914]], English-born South African businessman, mining magnate and politician [[Cecil Rhodes]] advocated the [[British Empire]] reannexing the United States of America and reforming itself into an "[[Imperial Federation]]" to bring about a [[hyperpower]] and lasting [[world peace]]. In his first will, written in 1877 at the age of 23, he expressed his wish to fund a [[secret society]] (known as the [[Society of the Elect]]) that would advance this goal:

{{quotation|To and for the establishment, promotion and development of a Secret Society, the true aim and object whereof shall be for the extension of British rule throughout the world, the perfecting of a system of emigration from the United Kingdom, and of colonisation by British subjects of all lands where the means of livelihood are attainable by energy, labour and enterprise, and especially the occupation by British settlers of the entire Continent of Africa, the Holy Land, the Valley of the Euphrates, the Islands of Cyprus and Candia, the whole of South America, the Islands of the Pacific not heretofore possessed by Great Britain, the whole of the Malay Archipelago, the seaboard of China and Japan, the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire, the inauguration of a system of Colonial representation in the Imperial Parliament which may tend to weld together the disjointed members of the Empire and, finally, the foundation of so great a Power as to render wars impossible, and promote the best interests of humanity.&lt;ref name="Flint 1976"/&gt;}}

[[File:Cecil_Rhodes_ww.jpg|thumb|upright|Magnate and colonist [[Cecil Rhodes]] advocated a secret society which would make Britain control the Earth]]
In 1890, thirteen years after "his now famous will," Rhodes elaborated on the same idea: establishment of "England everywhere," which would "ultimately lead to the cessation of all wars, and one language throughout the world." "The only thing feasible to carry out this idea is a secret society gradually absorbing the wealth of the world ["and human minds of the higher order"] to be devoted to such an object."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/04/09/101945773.pdf | work=The New York Times | title=MR.

He Believed a Wealthy Secret Society Should Work to Secure the World's Peace and a British-American Federation | date=9 April 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhodes also concentrated on the [[Rhodes Scholarship]], which had British statesman [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Alfred Milner]] as one of its trustees. Established in 1902, the original goal of the trust fund was to foster peace among the [[great powers]] by creating a sense of fraternity and a shared world view among future British, American, and German leaders by having enabled them to study for free at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Flint 1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Flint, John E.|title=Cecil Rhodes|publisher=Little Brown &amp; Company |edition=1st |date=1976|isbn=0-316-28630-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milner and British official [[Lionel George Curtis]] were the architects of the [[Round Table movement]], a network of organizations promoting closer union between Britain and its [[Self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]]. To this end, Curtis founded the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]] in June 1919 and, with his 1938 book ''The Commonwealth of God'', began advocating for the creation of an imperial federation that eventually reannexes the U.S., which would be presented to [[Protestant churches]] as being the work of the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] to elicit their support.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Lionel. ''Civitas Dei: The Commonwealth of God'' London (1938). MacMillan &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] was created in 1949 but it would only be a free association of independent states rather than the powerful imperial federation imagined by Rhodes, Milner and Curtis.

The [[Council on Foreign Relations]] began in 1917 with a group of New York academics who were asked by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to offer options for the [[foreign policy of the United States]] in the [[interwar period]]. Originally envisioned as a group of American and British scholars and diplomats, some of whom belonging to the Round Table movement, it was a subsequent group of 108 New York financiers, manufacturers and international lawyers organized in June 1918 by Nobel Peace Prize recipient and U.S. secretary of state [[Elihu Root]], that became the Council on Foreign Relations on 29 July 1921. The first of the council’s projects was a quarterly journal launched in September 1922, called ''[[Foreign Affairs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/about/history/cfr/index.html|title=About CFR|website=Council on Foreign Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trilateral Commission]] was founded in July 1973, at the initiative of American banker [[David Rockefeller]], who was chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations at that time. It is a private organization established to foster closer cooperation among the United States, Europe and Japan. The Trilateral Commission is widely seen as a counterpart to the Council on Foreign Relations.

In the 1960s, [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] individuals and groups with a [[paleoconservatism|paleoconservative]] worldview, such as members of the [[John Birch Society]], were the first to combine and spread a [[business nationalism|business nationalist]] critique of [[neoliberalism|corporate internationalists]] networked through think tanks such as the Council on Foreign Relations with a grand conspiracy theory casting them as [[front organization]]s for the Round Table of the "Anglo-American [[the Establishment|Establishment]]", which are financed by an "international banking cabal" that has supposedly been plotting from the late 19th century on to impose an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] new world order through a [[global financial system]]. Anti-[[globalism|globalist]] conspiracy theorists therefore fear that international bankers are planning to eventually subvert the independence of the U.S. by subordinating national [[sovereignty]] to a strengthened [[Bank for International Settlements]].&lt;ref name="Scienta Press"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scienta Press staff|title=Carroll Quigley: Theorist of Civilizations|url=http://www.scientiapress.com/carroll-quigley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research findings of historian [[Carroll Quigley]], author of the 1966 book ''[[Tragedy and Hope]]'', are taken by both conspiracy theorists of the American [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] ([[W. Cleon Skousen]]) and [[New Left]] ([[Carl Oglesby]]) to substantiate this view, even though Quigley argued that the Establishment is not involved in a plot to implement a one-world government but rather British and American [[American imperialism|benevolent imperialism]] driven by the mutual interests of economic elites in the United Kingdom and the United States. Quigley also argued that, although the [[Round Table movement#Current organisation and membership|Round Table still exists today]], its position in influencing the policies of world leaders has been much reduced from its heyday during [[World War I]] and slowly waned after the end of [[World War II]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]. Today the Round Table is largely a [[ginger group]], designed to consider and gradually influence the policies of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], but faces strong opposition. Furthermore, in American society after 1965, the problem, according to Quigley, was that no elite was in charge and acting responsibly.&lt;ref name="Scienta Press"/&gt;

[[Larry McDonald]], the second president of the [[John Birch Society]] and a [[conservative Democrat]]ic member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] who represented the 7th congressional district of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], wrote a foreword for [[Gary Allen|Allen]]'s 1976 book ''The Rockefeller File'', wherein he claimed that the Rockefellers and their allies were driven by a desire to create a one-world government that combined "super-[[capitalism]]" with [[communism]] and would be fully under their control. He saw a conspiracy plot that was "international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent."&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lawrence P. Introduction. [http://www.mega.nu:8080/ampp/gary_allen_rocker/ ''The Rockefeller File'']. By [[Gary Allen]]. Seal Beach, CA: '76 Press, 1976. {{ISBN|0-89245-001-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2002 autobiography ''Memoirs'', David Rockefeller wrote:

{{quotation|For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents ... to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure—one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.&lt;ref name="Rockefeller 1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rockefeller, David|title=Memoirs|publisher=Random House|date=2002|isbn=0-679-40588-7|authorlink=David Rockefeller}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Barkun argues that this statement is partly facetious (the claim of "conspiracy" and "[[treason]]") and partly serious—the desire to encourage trilateral cooperation among the U.S., Europe, and Japan, for example—an ideal that used to be a hallmark of the [[neoliberalism|internationalist]] wing of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (known as "[[Rockefeller Republican]]s" in honor of [[Nelson Rockefeller]]) when there was an internationalist wing. The statement, however, is taken at face value and widely cited by conspiracy theorists as proof that the Council on Foreign Relations uses its role as the [[brain trust]] of American presidents, senators and representatives to manipulate them into supporting a New World Order in the form of a one-world government.

In a 13 November 2007 interview with Canadian journalist Benjamin Fulford, Rockefeller countered that he felt no need for a world government and wished for the governments of the world to work together and collaborate. He also stated that it seemed neither likely nor desirable to have only one elected government rule the whole world. He criticized accusations of him being "ruler of the world" as nonsensical.&lt;ref name="Fulford 2007"&gt;{{cite video|author=Fulford, Benjamin|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3704527408635856046 |title=Benjamin Fulford interviews David Rockefeller |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some American [[social criticism|social critics]], such as Laurence H. Shoup, argue that the Council on Foreign Relations is an "[[American imperialism#Marxist–Leninist|imperial]] brain trust" which has, for decades, played a central behind-the-scenes role in shaping U.S. foreign policy choices for the post-World War II international order and the [[Cold War]] by determining what options show up on the [[political agenda|agenda]] and what options do not even make it to the table;&lt;ref name="Shoup &amp; Minter 2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shoup, Laurence H.|author2=Minter, William|title=Imperial Brain Trust: The Council on Foreign Relations and United States Foreign Policy|publisher=Authors Choice Press|date=2004|isbn=0-595-32426-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; others, such as [[G.

All the council does is sponsor discussion groups, debates and speakers. As far as being secretive, it issues annual reports and allows access to its historical archives." However, all these critics agree{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} that "[h]istorical studies of the CFR show that it has a very different role in the overall power structure than what is claimed by conspiracy theorists."&lt;ref name="Domhoff 2005"/&gt;

===''The Open Conspiracy''===
[[File:H.G._Wells_by_Beresford.jpg|thumb|upright|[[H. G. Wells]] wrote the books ''[[The Open Conspiracy]]'' and ''[[The New World Order (Wells)|The New World Order]]'']]
In his 1928 book ''[[The Open Conspiracy]]'' British writer and futurist [[H. G. Wells]] promoted [[cosmopolitanism]] and offered blueprints for a [[world revolution]] and [[World Brain|world brain]] to establish a technocratic [[world state]] and [[planned economy]].&lt;ref name="Wells 1928"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wells, H. G.|title=[[The Open Conspiracy]]|publisher=Book Tree|date=2006|isbn=1-58509-275-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells warned, however, in his 1940 book ''[[The New World Order (Wells)|The New World Order]]'' that:

{{quotation|... when the struggle seems to be drifting definitely towards a world social democracy, there may still be very great delays and disappointments before it becomes an efficient and beneficent world system. Countless people ... will hate the new world order, be rendered unhappy by the frustration of their passions and ambitions through its advent and will die protesting against it. When we attempt to evaluate its promise, we have to bear in mind the distress of a generation or so of malcontents, many of them quite gallant and graceful-looking people.&lt;ref name="Wells 1940"/&gt;}}

Wells's books were influential in giving a second meaning to the term "[[new world order (politics)|new world order]]", which would only be used by [[state socialism|state socialist]] supporters and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] opponents for generations to come. However, despite the popularity and notoriety of his ideas, Wells failed to exert a deeper and more lasting influence because he was unable to concentrate his energies on a direct appeal to [[intelligentsia]]s who would, ultimately, have to coordinate the Wellsian new world order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2009188|title=H.

===New Age===
British [[Neo-Theosophy|neo-Theosophical]] occultist [[Alice Bailey]], one of the founders of the so-called [[New Age]] movement, prophesied in 1940 the eventual victory of the [[Allies of World War II]] over the [[Axis powers]] (which occurred in 1945) and the establishment by the Allies of a political and religious New World Order. She saw a federal world government as the culmination of [[The Open Conspiracy|Wells' Open Conspiracy]] but favorably argued that it would be [[synarchist]] because it was guided by the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]], intent on preparing humanity for the [[Second Coming of Christ#Theosophy|mystical second coming]] of [[Christ]], and the dawning of the [[Age of Aquarius]]. According to Bailey, a group of ascended masters called the [[Great White Brotherhood]] works on the "[[plane (esotericism)|inner planes]]" to oversee the transition to the New World Order but, for now, the members of this [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] are only known to a few occult scientists, with whom they communicate [[telepathy|telepathically]], but as the need for their personal involvement in the plan increases, there will be an "Externalization of the Hierarchy" and everyone will know of their presence on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bailey, Alice A.|date=1957|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/externalisation/contents.html|title=The Externalization of the Hierarchy|publisher=USNISA|accessdate=2009-07-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805093622/http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/externalisation/contents.html|archivedate=5 August 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey's writings, along with American writer [[Marilyn Ferguson]]'s 1980 book ''[[Marilyn Ferguson#The Aquarian Conspiracy|The Aquarian Conspiracy]]'', contributed to conspiracy theorists of the [[Christian right]] viewing the New Age movement as the "[[pseudoreligion|false religion]]" that would [[supersessionism|supersede]] Christianity in a New World Order.&lt;ref name="Cumbey 1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cumbey, Constance|title=The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow: The New Age Movement and our Coming Age of Barbarism|publisher=Huntington House Publishers; Revised edition|date=1985|isbn=0-910311-03-X|authorlink=Constance Cumbey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics argue that the term "New Age movement" is a misnomer, generally used by conspiracy theorists as a catch-all rubric for any [[new religious movement]] that is not [[fundamentalist Christian]]. By this logic, anything that is not Christian is by definition actively and willfully [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McKeown, Trevor W.|date=5 May 2004|url=http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/anti-masonry08.html#new|title=Has Freemasonry become part of the New Age movement?|work=Anti-masonry Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon A.F. &amp; A. M.|accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, since the first decade of the 21st century, New World Order conspiracism is increasingly being embraced and propagandized by New Age [[occultists]], who are people bored by [[rationalism]] and drawn to [[stigmatized knowledge]]—such as [[alternative medicine]], [[astrology]], [[quantum mysticism]], [[spiritualism]], and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]].&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt; Thus, New Age conspiracy theorists, such as the makers of documentary films like ''Esoteric Agenda'', claim that globalists who plot on behalf of the New World Order are simply misusing occultism for [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] ends, such as adopting 21 December 2012 as the exact date for the establishment of the New World Order for the purpose of taking advantage of the growing [[2012 phenomenon]], which has its origins in the fringe [[Mayanism|Mayanist]] theories of New Age writers [[José Argüelles]], [[Terence McKenna]], and [[Daniel Pinchbeck]].

Skeptics argue that the connection of conspiracy theorists and occultists follows from their common fallacious premises. First, any widely accepted belief must necessarily be false. Second, stigmatized knowledge—what [[the Establishment]] spurns—must be true. The result is a large, [[Crank (person)#Crank magnetism|self-referential network]] in which, for example, some [[UFO religion]]ists promote anti-Jewish phobias while some antisemites practice Peruvian [[shamanism]].&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;

===Fourth Reich===
[[File:Jim_PR_2010.jpg|thumb|upright|American writer [[Jim Marrs]] claimed that former Nazis and their sympathizers have been continuing Nazi policies worldwide, especially in the United States]]
Conspiracy theorists often use the term "[[Fourth Reich]]" simply as a pejorative synonym for the "New World Order" to imply that its state ideology and government will be similar to Germany's [[Third Reich]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Conspiracy theorists, such as American writer [[Jim Marrs]], claim that some [[list of former Nazi Party members|ex-Nazis]], who survived the fall of the [[Nazi Germany|Greater German Reich]], along with sympathizers in the United States and elsewhere, given haven by organizations like [[ODESSA]] and [[Die Spinne]], have been working behind the scenes since the end of [[World War II]] to enact at least some principles of [[Nazism]] (e.g., [[militarism]], [[imperialism]], [[surveillance abuse|widespread spying on citizens]], [[corporatism]], the use of [[propaganda model|propaganda to manufacture a national consensus]]) into culture, government, and business worldwide, but primarily in the U.S. They cite the influence of ex-Nazi scientists brought in under [[Operation Paperclip]] to help advance aerospace manufacturing in the U.S. with technological principles from [[Nazi UFOs]], and the acquisition and creation of [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] by ex-Nazis and their sympathizers after the war, in both [[Europe]] and the U.S.&lt;ref name="Marrs 2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marrs, Jim|title=The Rise of the Fourth Reich: The Secret Societies That Threaten to Take Over America|publisher=William Morrow|date=2008|isbn=978-0-06-124558-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[neo-Nazi]] conspiracy is said to be animated by an "Iron Dream" in which the [[American imperialism|American Empire]], having thwarted the [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Judeo-Masonic conspiracy]] and overthrown its [[Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|Zionist Occupation Government]], gradually establishes a Fourth Reich formerly known as the "Western Imperium"—a [[pan-nationalism|pan]]-[[Aryan race|Aryan]] world empire modeled after [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]]—which reverses the "[[The Decline of the West|decline of the West]]" and ushers a golden age of [[white supremacy]].&lt;ref name="Zeskind 2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zeskind, Leonard|title=Blood and Politics: The History of the White Nationalist Movement from the Margins to the Mainstream|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|date=2009|isbn=0-374-10903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics argue that conspiracy theorists grossly overestimate the influence of ex-Nazis and neo-Nazis on American society, and point out that [[political repression]] at home and [[imperialism]] abroad have a long history in the United States that predates the 20th century. Some political scientists, such as [[Sheldon Wolin]], have expressed concern that the twin forces of [[democratic deficit]] and [[superpower]] status have paved the way in the U.S. for the emergence of an [[inverted totalitarianism]] which contradicts many principles of Nazism.&lt;ref name="Wolin 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pipes, Daniel|title=Inverted Totalitarianism|date=1 May 2003|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/inverted-totalitarianism|accessdate=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alien invasion===
Since the late 1970s, [[extraterrestrials]] from other [[planetary habitability|habitable planets]] or [[interdimensional hypothesis|parallel dimensions]] (such as "[[Grey alien|Greys]]") and intraterrestrials from [[Hollow Earth]] (such as "[[Reptilian humanoid|Reptilians]]") have been included in the New World Order conspiracy, in more or less dominant roles, as in the theories put forward by American writers Stan Deyo and [[Milton William Cooper]], and British writer [[David Icke]].&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/140296|title=Page not found|website=Alternet|access-date=2018-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502090010/http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/140296#|archive-date=2012-05-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frel 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frel, January|title=Inside the Great Reptilian Conspiracy: From Queen Elizabeth to Barack Obama – They Live!|date=1 September 2010|url=http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/147967|accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Icke, 7 June 2013 (1).jpg|thumb|British writer [[David Icke]] claims that shapeshifting aliens called [[Reptilian humanoid|Reptilians]] control the Earth]]
The common theme in these conspiracy theories is that aliens have been among us for decades, centuries or millennia, but a government [[cover-up]] enforced by "[[Men in Black]]" has shielded the public from knowledge of a secret [[alien invasion]]. Motivated by [[speciesism]] and [[imperialism]], these aliens have been and are secretly manipulating developments and changes in [[human]] society in order to more efficiently control and exploit human beings. In some theories, alien infiltrators have [[shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] into human form and [[cryptoterrestrial hypothesis|move freely throughout human society]], even to the point of taking control of command positions in governmental, corporate, and religious institutions, and are now in the final stages of their plan to take over the world.&lt;ref name="Frel 2010"/&gt; A mythical covert government agency of the United States code-named [[Majestic 12]] is often imagined being the [[Shadow government (conspiracy)|shadow government]] which [[collaborationism|collaborates]] with the alien occupation and permits [[alien abduction]]s, in exchange for assistance in the development and testing of [[Circular wing|military "flying saucers"]] at [[Area 51]], in order for [[United States armed forces]] to achieve [[full-spectrum dominance]].&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;

Skeptics, who adhere to the [[psychosocial hypothesis]] for [[unidentified flying objects]], argue that the convergence of New World Order conspiracy theory and [[UFO conspiracy theory]] is a product of not only the era's widespread mistrust of governments and the popularity of the [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]] for UFOs but of the [[far right]] and [[ufologist]]s actually joining forces. Barkun notes that the only positive side to this development is that, if conspirators plotting to rule the world are believed to be aliens, traditional human [[scapegoating|scapegoats]] ([[Freemasons]], [[Illuminati]], [[Jews]], etc.) are downgraded or exonerated.&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;

===''Brave New World''===
[[Antiscience]] and [[neo-Luddism|neo-Luddite]] conspiracy theorists emphasize [[technology forecasting]] in their New World Order conspiracy theories. They speculate that the global power elite are [[reactionary modernism|reactionary modernists]] pursuing a [[transhumanist]] agenda to develop and use [[human enhancement technologies]] in order to become a "[[Posthuman#Posthuman in transhumanism|posthuman]] ruling [[caste]]", while [[accelerating change|change accelerates]] toward a [[technological singularity]]—a theorized future point of discontinuity when events will accelerate at such a pace that normal unenhanced humans will be unable to predict or even understand the rapid changes occurring in the world around them. Conspiracy theorists fear the outcome will either be the emergence of a ''[[Brave New World]]''-like [[dystopia]]—a "Brave New World Order"—or the [[human extinction|extinction of the human species]].&lt;ref name="Collins 2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Collins, Phillip D.|title=The Ascendancy of the Scientific Dictatorship: An Examination of Epistemic Autocracy, From the 19th to the 21st Century|publisher=BookSurge Publishing|date=2006|isbn=1-4196-3932-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[democratic transhumanism|Democratic transhumanists]], such as American sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]], counter that many influential members of the United States Establishment are [[bioconservatism|bioconservatives]] strongly opposed to [[human enhancement]], as demonstrated by [[The President's Council on Bioethics|President Bush's Council on Bioethics]]'s proposed international treaty prohibiting [[human cloning]] and [[germline engineering]]. Furthermore, he argues that conspiracy theorists underestimate how fringe the transhumanist movement really is.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hughes, James|title=[[Citizen Cyborg]]: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future|publisher=Westview Press|date=2004|isbn=0-8133-4198-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postulated implementations==
Just as there are several overlapping or conflicting theories among conspiracists about the nature of the New World Order, so are there several beliefs about how its architects and planners will implement it:

===Gradualism===
Conspiracy theorists generally speculate that the New World Order is being implemented [[Gradualism#Politics and society|gradually]], citing the formation of the U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913; the [[League of Nations]] in 1919; the [[International Monetary Fund]] in 1944; the United Nations in 1945; the [[World Bank]] in 1945; the [[World Health Organization]] in 1948; the European Union and the euro currency in 1993; the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1998; the [[African Union]] in 2002; and the [[Union of South American Nations]] in 2008 as major milestones.&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;

An increasingly popular conspiracy theory among American [[right-wing populism|right-wing populists]] is that the hypothetical [[North American Union]] and the amero currency, proposed by the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and its counterparts in [[Mexico]] and [[Canada]], will be the next milestone in the implementation of the New World Order. The theory holds that a group of shadowy and mostly nameless international elites are planning to replace the [[federal government of the United States]] with a [[transnationality|transnational]] government. Therefore, conspiracy theorists believe the borders between Mexico, Canada and the United States are in the process of being erased, covertly, by a group of globalists whose ultimate goal is to replace national governments in Washington, D.C., Ottawa and Mexico City with a European-style political union and a bloated E.U.-style bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Holland 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Holland, Joshua|title=Debunking the North American Union Conspiracy Theory|date=15 June 2007|url=http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/54184/|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics argue that the North American Union exists only as a proposal contained in one of a thousand academic and policy papers published each year that advocate all manner of idealistic but ultimately unrealistic approaches to social, economic and political problems. Most of these are passed around in their own circles and eventually filed away and forgotten by junior staffers in congressional offices. Some of these papers, however, become touchstones for the conspiracy-minded and form the basis of all kinds of unfounded xenophobic fears especially during times of economic anxiety.&lt;ref name="Holland 2007"/&gt;

For example, in March 2009, as a result of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation pressed for urgent consideration of a new international [[reserve currency]] and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] proposed greatly expanding the I.M.F.'s [[special drawing rights]]. Conspiracy theorists fear these proposals are a call for the U.S. to adopt a [[world currency#Single world currency|single global currency]] for a New World Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/state/41919847.html?page=1&amp;c=y|title=Bachmann: No foreign currency|date=26 March 2009|publisher=''Star Tribune''|accessdate=2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/2009/03/25/from-drudge-to-fox/|title=The Right-Wing Echo Chamber In Action: How A Conspiracy Travels From Drudge To Obama, Via Fox News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging that both national governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems that go beyond the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that [[regionalism (international relations)|regionalism]] will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere around Washington, D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]], and the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]] will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether [[global governance]] is gradually emerging, but rather how will these [[regional powers]] interact with one another.&lt;ref name="Partridge 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Partridge |first=Mark C |title=One World Government: Conspiracy Theory or Inevitable Future? |date=14 December 2008 |url=http://www.diplomaticourier.org/kmitan/articleback.php?newsid=259 |accessdate=4 May 2014 |archivedate=17 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817053548/http://www.diplomaticourier.org/kmitan/articleback.php?newsid=259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coup d'état===
[[File:CBP_UH-60_Blackhawk.jpg|thumb|upright|The American [[militia movement]] claim that a [[coup d'état]] will be launched by a "[[The Secret Team|Secret Team]]" in [[black helicopter]]s]]
American [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] conspiracy theorists, especially those who joined the [[militia movement]] in the United States, speculate that the New World Order will be implemented through a dramatic [[coup d'état]] by a "[[Secret Team|secret team]]", using [[black helicopter]]s, in the U.S. and other nation-states to bring about a [[totalitarian]] world government controlled by the [[United Nations]] and enforced by troops of foreign [[Department of Peacekeeping Operations|U.N. peacekeepers]]. Following the [[Rex 84]] and [[Operation Garden Plot]] plans, this military coup would involve the suspension of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], the imposition of [[martial law]], and the appointment of [[military dictatorship|military commanders to head state and local governments]] and to detain [[dissident]]s.&lt;ref name="Levitas 2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Levitas, Daniel|title=The Terrorist Next Door: The Militia Movement and the Radical Right|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|date=20 January 2004|isbn=0-312-32041-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These conspiracy theorists, who are all strong believers in a [[right to keep and bear arms]], are extremely fearful that the passing of any [[gun control]] legislation will be later followed by the abolishment of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation, and that the [[refugee camp]]s of emergency management agencies such as [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] will be used for the [[internment]] of suspected [[subversives]], making little effort to distinguish true threats to the New World Order from pacifist dissidents.&lt;ref name="Anti-Defamation League"/&gt;

Before year 2000 some [[survivalist]]s wrongly believed this process would be set in motion by the predicted [[Y2K problem]] causing [[societal collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/09/98/conspiracy_-_radio_5_live/185161.stm|title=Death to the New World Order|accessdate=2006-06-24|author=BBC News Special Report |date=5 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since many left-wing and right-wing conspiracy theorists believe that the [[9/11 conspiracy theories|11 September attacks were a false flag operation]] carried out by the [[United States intelligence community]], as part of a [[strategy of tension]] to justify [[political repression]] at home and [[preemptive war]] abroad, they have become convinced that a more catastrophic [[terrorist incident]] will be responsible for triggering [[Executive Directive 51]] in order to complete the transition to a [[police state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2176185/pagenum/all/#p2|title=Who Will Rule Us After the Next 9/11?|accessdate=2009-04-04|author=Ron Rosenbaum|date=19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics argue that unfounded fears about an imminent or eventual gun ban, military coup, internment, or U.N. invasion and occupation are rooted in the [[siege mentality]] of the American militia movement but also an [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] [[millenarianism]] which provides a basic narrative within the political right in the U.S., claiming that the idealized society (i.e., constitutional republic, [[Jeffersonian democracy]], "[[Christian nation]]", "[[white nationalism|white nation]]") is thwarted by subversive conspiracies of [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[secular humanism|secular humanists]] who want "[[Big Government]]" and globalists who plot on behalf of the New World Order.&lt;ref name="Berlet 1999"/&gt;

===Mass surveillance===
{{Global surveillance}}

Conspiracy theorists concerned with [[surveillance abuse]] believe that the New World Order is being implemented by the [[cult of intelligence]] at the core of the [[surveillance-industrial complex]] through [[mass surveillance]] and the use of [[Social Security number]]s, the [[barcode|bar-coding]] of retail goods with [[Universal Product Code]] markings, and, most recently, [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID tagging]] by [[microchip implant (human)|microchip implants]].&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;

Claiming that corporations and government are planning to track every move of consumers and citizens with RFID as the latest step toward a ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]''-like [[surveillance state]], [[consumer privacy]] advocates, such as [[Katherine Albrecht]] and [[Liz McIntyre (writer)|Liz McIntyre]],&lt;ref name="Albrecht &amp; McIntyre 2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albrecht, Katherine |author-link=Katherine Albrecht|author2=McIntyre, Liz|author2-link=Liz McIntyre (writer)|title=The Spychips Threat: Why Christians Should Resist RFID and Electronic Surveillance|publisher=Nelson Current|date=2006|isbn=1-59555-021-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; have become Christian conspiracy theorists who believe [[spychip]]s must be resisted because they argue that modern [[database]] and [[information and communication technologies|communications technologies]], coupled with [[point of sale]] [[automatic identification and data capture|data-capture]] equipment and sophisticated ID and [[authentication]] systems, now make it possible to require a [[biometrics|biometrically]] associated number or mark to make purchases. They fear that the ability to implement such a system closely resembles the [[Number of the Beast]] prophesied in the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;

In January 2002, the [[Information Awareness Office]] (IAO) was established by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) to bring together several DARPA projects focused on applying information technology to counter [[asymmetric warfare|asymmetric threats]] to [[national security]]. Following public criticism that the development and deployment of these technologies could potentially lead to a mass surveillance system, the IAO was defunded by the United States Congress in 2003.&lt;ref name="eff-tia-funding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/TIA/20031003_comments.php|title=Total/Terrorism Information Awareness (TIA): Is It Truly Dead?|date=2003|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (official website)|accessdate=2009-03-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325113304/http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/TIA/20031003_comments.php|archivedate=25 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second source of controversy involved IAO’s original logo, which depicted the "all-seeing" [[Eye of Providence]] atop of a pyramid looking down over the globe, accompanied by the Latin phrase ''[[scientia potentia est|scientia est potentia]]'' (knowledge is power).

American historian [[Richard Landes]], who specializes in the history of [[apocalypticism]] and was co-founder and director of the [[Center for Millennial Studies]] at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger [[alarmism]] among [[millenarianism|millenarians]] and even the introduction of [[printing press|Gutenberg's printing press]] in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking. The [[Year 2000 problem]], bar codes and Social Security numbers all triggered [[end time|end-time]] warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Baard, Mark|title=RFID: Sign of the (End) Times?|work=wired.com|url=https://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,70308-0.html|accessdate=18 December 2006|date=6 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil libertarians argue that the privatization of surveillance and the rise of the surveillance-industrial complex in the United States does raise legitimate concerns about the erosion of [[privacy]].&lt;ref name="ACLU 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stanley, Jay|title=The Surveillance-Industrial Complex: How the American Government Is Conscripting Businesses and Individuals in the Construction of a Surveillance Society|date=August 2004|journal= American Civil Liberties Union| url=https://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/surveillance_report.pdf|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]] or religious hysteria about the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;

===Occultism===
Conspiracy theorists of the [[Christian right]], starting with British revisionist historian [[Nesta Helen Webster]], believe there is an ancient [[occult]] conspiracy—started by the first [[mystagogue]]s of [[Gnosticism]] and perpetuated by their alleged [[esotericism|esoteric]] successors, such as the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]], [[Cathars]], [[Knights Templar]], [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]], [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]], [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], and, ultimately, the [[Illuminati]]—which seeks to subvert the [[Judeo-Christian]] foundations of the [[Western world]] and implement the New World Order through a one-world religion that prepares the masses to embrace the [[imperial cult]] of the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt; More broadly, they speculate that globalists who plot on behalf of a New World Order are directed by occult agencies of some sort: [[Rite of Strict Observance|unknown superiors]], [[Spiritual Hierarchy|spiritual hierarchies]], [[demon]]s, [[fallen angel]]s or [[Lucifer#Occult beliefs|Lucifer]]. They believe that these conspirators use the power of occult sciences ([[numerology]]), symbols ([[Eye of Providence]]), rituals ([[Master Mason|Masonic degrees]]), monuments ([[National Mall#Landmarks, museums and other features|National Mall landmarks]]), buildings ([[Manitoba Legislative Building]]&lt;ref name="Albo 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albo|first=Frank|title=The Hermetic Code|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|date=2007|isbn=0-9682575-3-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and facilities ([[Denver International Airport]]) to advance their plot to rule the world.&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marrs 2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marrs, Jim|title=Our Occulted History|publisher=William Morrow|date=2013|isbn=978-0-06-213032-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in June 1979, an unknown benefactor under the pseudonym "[[Christian Rosenkreuz|R. C. Christian]]" had a huge granite [[megalith]] built in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], which acts like a compass, calendar, and clock. A message comprising ten guides is inscribed on the occult structure in many languages to serve as instructions for survivors of a [[doomsday event]] to establish a more enlightened and sustainable civilization than the one which was destroyed. The "[[Georgia Guidestones]]" have subsequently become a spiritual and political [[Rorschach test]] onto which any number of ideas can be imposed. Some New Agers and [[neo-pagan]]s revere it as a [[ley line|ley-line]] power nexus while a few conspiracy theorists are convinced that they are engraved with the New World Order's anti-Christian "[[Ten Commandments]]." Should the Guidestones survive for centuries as their creators intended, many more meanings could arise, equally unrelated to the designer’s original intention.&lt;ref name="Laycock 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laycock |first1=Joseph |title=10 Commandments of the Anti-Christ: Mysterious "Guidestones" Madden Conspiracy Theorists and Christian Fundamentalists |journal=AlterNet |date=6 July 2009 |url=http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/141107 |accessdate=14 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170823/http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/141107 |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics argue that the [[demonization]] of [[Western esotericism]] by conspiracy theorists is rooted in [[religious intolerance]] but also in the same [[moral panic]]s that have fueled [[witch trials in the Early Modern period]], and [[satanic ritual abuse]] allegations in the United States.&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;

===Population control===
Conspiracy theorists believe that the New World Order will also be implemented through the use of [[human population control]] in order to more easily monitor and control the movement of individuals.&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt; The means range from stopping the growth of human societies through [[reproductive health]] and [[family planning]] programs, which promote [[abstinence]], [[contraception]] and [[abortion]], or intentionally reducing the bulk of the [[world population]] through [[genocides]] by mongering unnecessary wars, through [[plague (disease)|plagues]] by engineering [[emergent virus]]es and tainting [[vaccine]]s, and through [[environmental disasters]] by [[weather control|controlling the weather]] ([[High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program|HAARP]], [[chemtrail conspiracy theory|chemtrails]]), etc. Conspiracy theorists argue that globalists plotting on behalf of a New World Order are [[Neo-Malthusianism|neo-Malthusians]] who engage in [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and [[climate change]] alarmism in order to create public support for coercive population control and ultimately world government. [[Agenda 21]] is condemned as "reconcentrating" people into urban areas and depopulating rural ones, even generating a dystopian novel by [[Glenn Beck]] where single-family homes are a distant memory.

Skeptics argue that fears of population control can be traced back to the traumatic legacy of the [[eugenics]] movement's "war against the weak" in the United States during the first decades of the 20th century but also the [[Second Red Scare]] in the U.S. during the late 1940s and 1950s, and to a lesser extent in the 1960s, when activists on the [[far right]] of American politics routinely opposed [[public health]] programs, notably [[water fluoridation]], mass [[vaccination]] and [[mental health]] services, by asserting they were all part of a far-reaching plot to impose a socialist or communist regime.&lt;ref name="Henig"&gt;{{cite book|last=Henig|first=Robin Marantz|title=The People's Health|publisher=Joseph Henry Press| date=1997|isbn=0-309-05492-3|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their views were influenced by opposition to a number of major social and political changes that had happened in recent years: the growth of [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], particularly the [[United Nations]] and its programs; the introduction of social [[welfare]] provisions, particularly the various programs established by the [[New Deal]]; and government efforts to reduce inequalities in the [[social class in the United States|social structure of the U.S.]].&lt;ref name="Rovere"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rovere|first=Richard H.|title=Senator Joe McCarthy|publisher=University of California Press|date=1959|pages=21–22|isbn=0-520-20472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind control===
Social critics accuse governments, corporations, and the [[mass media]] of being involved in the [[propaganda model|manufacturing of a national consensus]] and, paradoxically, a [[culture of fear]] due to the potential for increased [[social control]] that a mistrustful and mutually fearing population might offer to those in power. The worst fear of some conspiracy theorists, however, is that the New World Order will be implemented through the use of [[mind control]]—a broad range of tactics able to subvert an individual's control of his or her own thinking, behavior, emotions, or decisions. These tactics are said to include everything from [[The Manchurian Candidate|Manchurian candidate]]-style [[brainwashing]] of [[sleeper agent]]s ([[Project MKULTRA]], "[[Project Monarch]]") to engineering [[psychological operations]] ([[water fluoridation]], [[subliminal message|subliminal advertising]], "[[microwave auditory effect|Silent Sound Spread Spectrum]]", [[MEDUSA (weapon)|MEDUSA]]) and [[parapsychology|parapsychological]] operations ([[Stargate Project]]) to influence the masses.&lt;ref name="Harrington 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harrington, Evan|title=Conspiracy Theories and Paranoia: Notes from a Mind-Control Conference|date=1996|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/9609/conspiracy.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317115600/http://csicop.org/si/9609/conspiracy.html|archivedate=17 March 2008|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of wearing a [[tin foil hat]] for protection from such threats has become a popular stereotype and term of derision; the phrase serves as a byword for [[paranoia]] and is associated with conspiracy theorists.

Skeptics argue that the paranoia behind a conspiracy theorist's obsession with [[mind control]], [[population control]], [[occultism]], [[surveillance abuse]], [[Big Business]], [[Big Government]], and [[globalization]] arises from a combination of two factors, when he or she: 1) holds strong [[individualist]] values and 2) lacks [[power (philosophy)|power]]. The first attribute refers to people who care deeply about an individual's right to make their own choices and direct their own lives without interference or obligations to a larger system (like the government), but combine this with a sense of powerlessness in one's own life, and one gets what some psychologists call "[[agency (philosophy)|agency]] panic," intense anxiety about an apparent loss of autonomy to outside forces or regulators. When fervent individualists feel that they cannot exercise their independence, they experience a crisis and assume that larger forces are to blame for usurping this freedom.&lt;ref name="Shrira 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilan|first1=Shrira|title=Paranoia and the roots of conspiracy theories - September 11 and the psychological roots of conspiracy theories|journal=Psychology Today|date=11 September 2008|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-narcissus-in-all-us/200809/paranoia-and-the-roots-conspiracy-theories|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-8606-8|last=Melley|first=Timothy|title=Empire of Conspiracy: The Culture of Paranoia in Postwar America|date=December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged conspirators==
According to Domhoff, many people seem to believe that the United States is [[cryptocracy|ruled from behind the scenes]] by a [[cabal|conspiratorial elite]] with secret desires, i.e., by a small secretive group that wants to change the government system or put the country under the control of a [[world government]]. In the past the conspirators were usually said to be [[crypto-communism|crypto-communists]] who were intent upon bringing the [[United States]] under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|dissolution of the USSR]] in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the [[United Nations]] as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American [[The Establishment|Establishment]] to give it anything but a limited role.&lt;ref name="Domhoff 2005"/&gt;

Although skeptical of New World Order conspiracism, political scientist [[David Rothkopf]] argues, in the 2008 book ''[[Superclass (book)|Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making]]'', that the world population of 6 billion people is governed by an elite of 6,000 individuals. Until the late 20th century, governments of the [[great power]]s provided most of the superclass, accompanied by a few heads of international movements (i.e., the [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]]) and entrepreneurs ([[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]], [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]]). According to Rothkopf, in the early 21st century, economic clout—fueled by the explosive expansion of international trade, travel and communication—rules; the [[nation-state]]'s power has diminished shrinking politicians to minority [[power broker (term)|power broker]] status; leaders in international business, finance and the defense industry not only dominate the superclass, they move freely into high positions in their nations' governments and back to private life largely beyond the notice of elected legislatures (including the U.S. Congress), which remain abysmally ignorant of affairs beyond their borders. He asserts that the superclass' disproportionate influence over national policy is constructive but always self-interested, and that across the world, few object to corruption and oppressive governments provided they can do business in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rothkopf, David J.|title=Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|date=2008|isbn=0-374-27210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewing the history of the world as the history of warfare between [[secret society|secret societies]], conspiracy theorists go further than Rothkopf, and other scholars who have studied the global [[power elite]], by claiming that established upper-class families with "[[old money]]" who founded and finance the [[Bilderberg Group]], [[Bohemian Club]], [[Club of Rome]], [[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[Rhodes House#The Rhodes Trust|Rhodes Trust]], [[Skull and Bones]], [[Trilateral Commission]], and similar think tanks and private clubs, are [[Illuminati|illuminated]] conspirators plotting to impose a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] New World Order—the implementation of an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] world government controlled by the United Nations and a [[Bank for International Settlements|global central bank]], which maintains political power through the [[finance capitalism|financialization of the economy]], regulation and restriction of [[freedom of speech|speech]] through the [[concentration of media ownership]], [[mass surveillance]], widespread use of [[state terrorism]], and an all-encompassing [[propaganda]] that creates a [[cult of personality]] around a puppet world leader and [[ideology|ideologizes]] world government as the [[Philosophy of history#Social evolutionism|culmination of history's progress]].&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;

[[Marxism|Marxists]], who are skeptical of [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] conspiracy theories, also accuse the global power elite of not having the best interests of all at heart, and many intergovernmental organizations of suffering from a [[democratic deficit]], but they argue that the superclass are [[plutocracy|plutocrats]] only interested in brazenly imposing a [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] or [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] new world order—the implementation of [[global capitalism]] through [[hard power|economic and military coercion]] to protect the interests of [[transnational corporation]]s—which systematically undermines the possibility of a [[international socialism|socialist]] one-world government.&lt;ref name="PLSweb.org 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Daniel Estulin and the phony 'Bilderberg conspiracy'|author=Party for Socialism and Liberation|author-link=Party for Socialism and Liberation|date=1 September 2010|url=http://www.pslweb.org/site/News2/2021559999?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=14431&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1261|accessdate=7 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807131645/http://www2.pslweb.org/site/News2/2021559999?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=14431&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1261|archivedate=7 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that the world is in the middle of a transition from the [[American imperialism|American Empire]] to the rule of a global ruling class that has emerged from within the American Empire, they point out that right-wing populist conspiracy theorists, blinded by their [[anti-communism]], fail to see is that what they demonize as the "New World Order" is, ironically, the highest stage of the very [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic system they defend.&lt;ref name="PLSweb.org 2010"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Skeptics of New World Order conspiracy theories accuse its proponents of indulging in the [[furtive fallacy]], a belief that significant facts of history are necessarily sinister; [[conspiracism]], a world view that centrally places conspiracy theories in the unfolding of history, rather than social and economic forces; and [[fusion paranoia]], a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever.&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"/&gt;

Domhoff, a research professor in psychology and sociology who studies theories of [[power (philosophy)|power]], wrote in 2005 an essay entitled ''There Are No Conspiracies''. He says that for this theory to be true it required several "wealthy and highly educated people" to do things that don't "fit with what we know about power structures". Claims that this will happen goes back decades and have always been proved wrong.

Partridge, a contributing editor to the global affairs magazine ''Diplomatic Courier'', wrote a 2008 article entitled ''One World Government: Conspiracy Theory or Inevitable Future?'' He says that if anything nationalism, which is the opposite of a global government, is rising. He also says that attempts at creating global governments or global agreements "have been categorical failures" and where "supranational governance exist they are noted for their bureaucracy and inefficiency."

Although some cultural critics see [[conspiracy theory#Types|superconspiracy theories]] about a New World Order as "[[postmodernism|postmodern]] [[metanarrative]]s" that may be politically empowering, a way of giving ordinary people a narrative structure with which to question what they see around them,&lt;ref name="Tyson and Kahn 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lewis, Tyson |author2=Kahn, Richard |title=The Reptoid Hypothesis: Utopian and Dystopian Representational Motifs in David Icke's Alien Conspiracy Theory |date=2005 |url=http://richardkahn.org/writings/culturalstudies/reptoidhypothesis.pdf |accessdate=4 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727215245/http://richardkahn.org/writings/culturalstudies/reptoidhypothesis.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; skeptics argue that conspiracism leads people into cynicism, convoluted thinking, and a tendency to feel it is hopeless even as they denounce the alleged conspirators.&lt;ref name="New Internationalist 2 2004"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Berlet, Chip|title=Interview: G. William Domhoff|date=September 2004|url=http://www.publiceye.org/antisemitism/nw_domhoff.html|accessdate=1 October 2009|authorlink=Chip Berlet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Zaitchik from the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] wrote a report titled "'Patriot' Paranoia: A Look at the Top Ten Conspiracy Theories", in which he personally condemns such conspiracies as an effort of the radical right to undermine society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2010/fall/patriot-paranoia|title='Patriot' Paranoia: A Look at the Top Ten Conspiracy Theories|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned that the [[improvisational millennialism]] of most conspiracy theories about a New World Order might motivate [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolves]] to engage in [[leaderless resistance]] leading to [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|domestic terrorist incidents]] like the [[Oklahoma City bombing]],&lt;ref name="Boyer 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Boyer, Paul S.|title=The Strange World of Conspiracy Theories|date=27 July 2004|url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3075|accessdate=1 October 2009|authorlink=Paul S. Boyer|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310080017/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3075|archivedate=10 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barkun writes that  "the danger lies less in such beliefs themselves ... than in the behavior they might stimulate or justify" and warns "should they believe that the prophesied evil day had in fact arrived, their behavior would become far more difficult to predict."

Warning of the threat to American democracy posed by [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] movements led by [[demagogy|demagogues]] who mobilize support for [[ochlocracy|mob rule]] or even a [[fascism|fascist]] revolution by exploiting the fear of conspiracies, Berlet writes that "Right-wing populist movements can cause serious damage to a society because they often popularize xenophobia, authoritarianism, scapegoating, and conspiracism. This can lure mainstream politicians to adopt these themes to attract voters, legitimize acts of discrimination (or even violence), and open the door for revolutionary right-wing populist movements, such as fascism, to recruit from the reformist populist movements."

Hughes, a professor of religion, warns that no religious idea has greater potential for shaping global politics in profoundly negative ways than "the new world order". He writes in a February 2011 article entitled ''Revelation, Revolutions, and the Tyrannical New World Order'' that "the crucial piece of this puzzle is the identity of the Antichrist, the tyrannical figure who both leads and inspires the new world order". This has in turn been the Soviet Union and the Arab world. He says that inspires believers to "welcome war with the Islamic world" and opens the door to nuclear holocaust."

Criticisms of New World Order conspiracy theorists also come from within their own community. Despite believing themselves to be "[[freedom fighter]]s", many right-wing populist conspiracy theorists hold views that are incompatible with their professed [[libertarianism]], such as [[dominionism]], [[white supremacy|white supremacism]], and even [[eliminationism]].&lt;ref name="Berlet 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holland 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Holland, Joshua |title=The Terrorist Threat: Right-Wing Radicals and the Eliminationist Mindset |date=12 June 2009 |url=http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/140578 |accessdate=23 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723075225/http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/140578 |archivedate=23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This paradox has led [[David Icke|Icke]], who argues that [[Christian Patriot movement|Christian Patriots]] are the only Americans who understand the truth about the New World Order (which he believes is controlled by a race of [[Reptilian humanoid|reptilians]] known as the "Babylonian Brotherhood"), to reportedly tell a Christian Patriot group, "I don't know which I dislike more, the world controlled by the Brotherhood, or the one you want to replace it with."

'''Rakvere Theatre''' is a professional [[theatre]] in [[Rakvere]], [[Estonia]].

==History==
Rakvere Theatre was established in the fall of 1921, when ''Rakvere Näitlejate Ring'' was formed. The building of the Rakvere Theatre was opened with a public ceremony on 24 February 1940, the 22nd anniversary of independent Estonia, the following day the first ever play, [[August Kitzberg]]'s ''"Tuulte pöörises"'' premiered.  The theatre’s [[artistic director]] is [[Üllar Saaremäe]], and theatre manager is Joonas Tartu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rakvereteater.ee/kaduviku_nimel/ajalugu/ History] at rakvereteater.ee&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andorra''' is one of only [[List of World Organization of the Scout Movement members#Countries with no Scouting organization|four of the world's independent countries that do not have Scouting]].&lt;!-- Cuba, North Korea, Laos and Andorra (PR China has been developing Scouting since 2004) --&gt; The population is sufficiently large to sustain [[Scouting]] (by population, the largest of the 5 [[microstates]] with 78,115 according to a 2011 census), but the Scout association of the tiny enclave in the [[Pyrenees]], '''''Scouts d'Andorra''''', has been dormant since the 1980s and at present there is no Scouting movement. At least one group was known to be sponsored by [[Roman Catholicism in Andorra|Collège Mare Janer]] private school, run along the lines of the [[Union Internationale des Guides et Scouts d′Europe|Scouts of Europe]] method.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The [[Scout motto]] in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is ''Sempre a punt''.

The [[Federació Catalana d'Escoltisme i Guiatge|Minyons Escoltes i Guies de Catalunya]], a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] Scouting organization, undertook a study on the possibilities for Scout groups in Andorra in summer 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.camidelsamicsdenuria.com/docs/Premsa/05_fd070701.pdf |title=S’estudia la creació d’un agrupament escolta a Andorra |publisher=[[Diocese of Urgell]] |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activities were started in 2008 and are supervised by the [[WOSM-European Region|European Scout Region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scout.org/en/content/download/12781/102757/file/20080613_Circular%2017_E.pdf |title=Circular N°17/06.08 |publisher=[[WOSM-European Region]] |accessdate=2010-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723163252/http://scout.org/en/content/download/12781/102757/file/20080613_Circular%2017_E.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2012, this is without success.&lt;ref&gt;Information derived from reports of [[Minyons Escoltes i Guies de Catalunya]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|date=July 2018}}

In taxation and accounting, '''transfer pricing''' refers to the rules and methods for pricing transactions within and between enterprises under common ownership or control. Because of the potential for cross-border controlled transactions to distort taxable income, tax authorities in many countries can adjust intragroup transfer prices that differ from what would have been charged by unrelated enterprises dealing at arm’s length (the [[arm’s length principle|arm’s-length principle]]).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/tpg-2010-en|title=OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2010, ''para. 0.18''|last=|first=|publisher=OECD Publishing|year=2010|isbn=978-92-64-09018-7|location=Paris|pages=|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/25095|title=Transfer Pricing and Developing Economies : A Handbook for Policy Makers and Practitioners|last=Cooper|first=Joel|last2=Fox|first2=Randall|last3=Loeprick|first3=Jan|last4=Mohindra|first4=Komal|publisher=World Bank|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4648-0970-5|location=Washington, DC|pages=18-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[OECD]] and World Bank recommend intragroup pricing rules based on the arm’s-length principle, and 19 of the 20 members of the G20 have adopted similar measures through bilateral treaties and domestic legislation, regulations, or administrative practice.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;World Bank pp. 35-51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 0.15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/ctp/transfer-pricing/transferpricingcountryprofiles.htm|title=Transfer Pricing Country Profiles - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries with transfer pricing legislation generally follow the [http://www.oecd.org/tax/transfer-pricing/oecd-transfer-pricing-guidelines-for-multinational-enterprises-and-tax-administrations-20769717.htm ''OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations''] in most respects,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; although their rules can differ on some important details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.taxnotes.com/tax-notes-international/base-erosion-and-profit-shifting-beps/year-review-year-many-arms-length-standards/2017/01/02/18720661|title=The Year in Review: The Year of the Many Arm's-Length Standards|last=|first=|date=|work=85 Tax Notes Int'l 25 (2017-01-02)|access-date=2017-02-27|publisher=Tax Analysts|volume=|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where adopted, transfer pricing rules allow tax authorities to adjust prices for most cross-border intragroup transactions, including transfers of tangible or intangible property, services, and loans.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 0.11&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a tax authority may increase a company’s taxable income by reducing the price of goods purchased from an affiliated foreign manufacturer&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.47-1.48&lt;/ref&gt; or raising the royalty the company must charge its foreign subsidiaries for rights to use a proprietary technology or brand name.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 6.1-6.39&lt;/ref&gt; These adjustments are generally calculated using one or more of the [https://www.royaltyrange.com/home/blog/transfer-pricing-methods transfer pricing methods] specified in the OECD guidelines&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 2.9&lt;/ref&gt; and are subject to judicial review or other dispute resolution mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 0.18, 4.1-4.168&lt;/ref&gt;

==In general==

Over sixty governments have adopted transfer pricing rules,&lt;ref&gt;Several websites provide overviews of transfer pricing regulations by country, such as the [http://www.tpanalytics.com/tp-reference/country-references/ Country References] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020124306/http://www.tpanalytics.com/tp-reference/country-references/ |date=2011-10-20 }} on the TP analytics website.&lt;/ref&gt;  which in almost all cases (with the notable exceptions of [[Brazil]] and [[Kazakhstan]]) are based on the arm's-length principle.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., OECD Guidelines 1.1 et seq., [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:6.0.1.1.1.0.8.179&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.482-1(b)].&lt;/ref&gt;  The rules of nearly all countries permit related parties to set prices in any manner, but permit the tax authorities to adjust those prices (for purposes of computing tax liability) where the prices charged are outside an arm's length range.  Most, if not all, governments permit adjustments by the tax authority even where there is no intent to avoid or evade tax.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:6.0.1.1.1.0.8.179&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.482-1(f)(1)(i).]&lt;/ref&gt; The rules generally require that market level, functions, risks, and terms of sale of unrelated party transactions or activities be reasonably comparable to such items with respect to the related party transactions or profitability being tested.

Adjustment of prices is generally made by adjusting taxable income of all involved related parties within the jurisdiction, as well as adjusting any withholding or other taxes imposed on parties outside the jurisdiction. Such adjustments are generally made after filing of tax returns. For example, if Bigco US charges Bigco Germany for a machine, either the U.S. or German tax authorities may adjust the price upon examination of the respective tax return.  Following an adjustment, the taxpayer generally is allowed (at least by the adjusting government) to make payments to reflect the adjusted prices.

Most systems allow use of transfer pricing multiple methods, where such methods are appropriate and are supported by reliable data, to test related party prices. Among the commonly used methods are comparable uncontrolled prices, [[cost-plus]], resale price or markup, and profitability based methods. Many systems differentiate methods of testing goods from those for services or use of property due to inherent differences in business aspects of such broad types of transactions. Some systems provide mechanisms for sharing or allocation of costs of acquiring assets (including intangible assets) among related parties in a manner designed to reduce tax controversy.Most governments have granted authorization to their tax authorities to adjust prices charged between related parties.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g''., law of the U.S. at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/482- 26 USC 482], UK at [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/ukpga_19880001_en_63 ICTA88/s770], Canada.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Note that OECD Guidelines leave this issue to member governments.&lt;/ref&gt;   Many such authorizations, including those of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany, allow domestic as well as international adjustments.  Some authorizations apply only internationally.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  

In addition, most systems recognize that an arm's length price may not be a particular price point but rather a range of prices. Some systems provide measures for evaluating whether a price within such range is considered arm's length, such as the ''interquartile range'' used in U.S. regulations.  Significant deviation among points in the range may indicate lack of reliability of data.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.45, 41; 26 CFR 1.482-1(e).&lt;/ref&gt;  Reliability is generally considered to be improved by use of multiple year data.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.49-1.51; 26 CFR 1.482-1(f)(2)(iii).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most rules require that the tax authorities consider actual transactions between parties, and permit adjustment only to actual transactions.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.36-1.41. and 26 CFR 1.482-1(f)(2)(ii).&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiple transactions may be aggregated or tested separately, and testing may use multiple year data.  In addition, transactions whose economic substance differs materially from their form may be recharacterized under the laws of many systems to follow the economic substance.

Transfer pricing adjustments have been a feature of many tax systems since the 1930s. The United States led the development of detailed, comprehensive transfer pricing guidelines with a [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-7322170.html White Paper] in 1988 and proposals in 1990-1992, which ultimately became regulations in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;TD 8552, 1994-2 C.B. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, the OECD issued its transfer pricing guidelines which it expanded in 1996 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;For a history of the earlier OECD efforts, see [http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan002475.pdf paper presented to the United Nations] in 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two sets of guidelines are broadly similar and contain certain principles followed by many countries. The OECD guidelines have been formally adopted by many European Union countries with little or no modification.

==Comparability==

Most rules provide standards for when unrelated party prices, transactions, profitability or other items are considered sufficiently comparable in testing related party items.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.15, ''et seq''., 26 CFR 1.482-1(d).&lt;/ref&gt;  Such standards typically require that data used in comparisons be reliable and that the means used to compare produce a reliable result. The U.S. and OECD rules require that reliable adjustments must be made for all differences (if any) between related party items and purported comparables that could materially affect the condition being examined.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.15, 26 CFR 1.482-1(d)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Where such reliable adjustments cannot be made, the reliability of the comparison is in doubt. Comparability of tested prices with uncontrolled prices is generally considered enhanced by use of multiple data. Transactions not undertaken in the ordinary course of business generally are not considered to be comparable to those taken in the ordinary course of business. Among the factors that must be considered in determining comparability are:&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.19-1.29; 26 CFR 1.482-1(d).&lt;/ref&gt;
*the nature of the property or services provided between the parties,
*functional analysis of the transactions and parties,
*comparison of contractual terms (whether written, verbal, or implied from conduct of the parties),and
*comparison of significant economic conditions that could affect prices, including the effects of different market levels and geographic markets.

===Nature of property or services===

Comparability is best achieved where identical items are compared.  However, in some cases it is possible to make reliable adjustments for differences in the particular items, such as differences in features or quality.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.19, 2.7, [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:6.0.1.1.1.0.8.183&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.482-3(b)(2)(ii)(A)], [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:6.0.1.1.1.0.8.191&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.482-9(c)(2)(ii)(A)].&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, gold prices might be adjusted based on the weight of the actual gold (one ounce of 10 carat gold would be half the price of one ounce of 20 carat gold).

===Functions and risks===

Buyers and sellers may perform different functions related to the exchange and undertake different risks.  For example, a seller of a machine may or may not provide a warranty.  The price a buyer would pay will be affected by this difference.  Among the functions and risks that may impact prices are:&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.20-1.27, 26 CFR 1.482-1(d)(3)(i) and (iii).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Product development
*Manufacturing and assembly
*Marketing and advertising
*Transportation and warehousing
*Credit risk
*Product obsolescence risk
*Market and entrepreneurial risks
*Collection risk
*Financial and currency risks
*Company- or industry-specific items

===Terms of sale===

Manner and terms of sale may have a material impact on price.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.28, 1.29, 26 CFR 1.482-1(d)(3)(ii).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, buyers will pay more if they can defer payment and buy in smaller quantities. Terms that may impact price include payment timing, warranty, volume discounts, duration of rights to use of the product, form of consideration, etc.

===Market level, economic conditions and geography===

Goods, services, or property may be provided to different levels of buyers or users:  producer to wholesaler, wholesaler to wholesaler, wholesaler to retailer, or for ultimate consumption.  Market conditions, and thus prices, vary greatly at these levels.  In addition, prices may vary greatly between different economies or geographies.  For example, a head of cauliflower at a retail market will command a vastly different price in unelectrified rural India than in Tokyo.  Buyers or sellers may have different market shares that allow them to achieve volume discounts or exert sufficient pressure on the other party to lower prices.  Where prices are to be compared, the putative comparables must be at the same market level, within the same or similar economic and geographic environments, and under the same or similar conditions.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.30, 26 CFR 1.482-1(d)(3)(iv).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testing of prices===
Tax authorities generally examine prices actually charged between related parties to determine whether adjustments are appropriate. Such examination is by comparison (testing) of such prices to comparable prices charged among unrelated parties.  Such testing may occur only on examination of tax returns by the tax authority, or taxpayers may be required to conduct such testing themselves in advance of filing tax returns.  Such testing requires a determination of how the testing must be conducted, referred to as a transfer pricing method.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 2.5, 26 CFR 1.482-.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Best method rule====
Some systems give preference to a specific method of testing prices.  OECD and U.S. systems, however, provide that the method used to test the appropriateness of related party prices should be that method that produces the most reliable measure of arm's length results.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.68-1.70, 26 CFR 1.482-1(c), [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:6.0.1.1.1.0.8.189&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.482-8].&lt;/ref&gt;  This is often known as a "best method" rule.  Factors to be considered include comparability of tested and independent items, reliability of available data and assumptions under the method, and validation of the results of the method by other methods.

====Comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method====
The comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method is a transactional method that determines the arm's-length price using the prices charged in comparable transactions between unrelated parties.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 2.13.&lt;/ref&gt; In principle, the OECD&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 2.3, 2.14.&lt;/ref&gt; and most countries that follow the OECD guidelines&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/ic87-2r/ic87-2r-e.html Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) Information Circular 87-2R] at [http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/ic87-2r/ic87-2r-e.html#P196_20259 paragraphs 52-53], and [http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?Docid=TXR/TR9720/NAT/ATO/00001 Australian Taxation Office (ATO) Taxation Ruling 97/20] at [http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?Docid=TXR/TR9720/NAT/ATO/00001#P3.15 paragraph 3.15].&lt;/ref&gt; consider the CUP method to be the most direct method, provided that any differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions have no material effect on price or their effects can be estimated and corresponding price adjustments can be made. Adjustments may be appropriate where the controlled and uncontrolled transactions differ only in volume or terms; for example, an interest adjustment could be applied where the only difference is time for payment (e.g., 30 days vs. 60 days). For undifferentiated products such as commodities, price data for arm's-length transactions ("external comparables") between two or more other unrelated parties may be available. For other transactions, it may be possible to use comparable transactions ("internal comparables") between the controlled party and unrelated parties.

The criteria for reliably applying the CUP method are often impossible to satisfy for licenses and other transactions involving unique intangible property,&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2015). [http://www.oecd.org/tax/aligning-transfer-pricing-outcomes-with-value-creation-actions-8-10-2015-final-reports-9789264241244-en.htm Aligning Transfer Pricing Outcomes with Value Creation, Actions 8-10 - 2015 Final Reports] ("OECD actions 8-10") at para. 6.146.&lt;/ref&gt; requiring use of valuation methods based on profit projections.&lt;ref&gt;OECD actions 8-10 at para. 6.153.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other transactional methods====
Among other methods relying on actual transactions (generally between one tested party and third parties) and not indices, aggregates, or market surveys are:
*[[Cost-plus]] (C+) method:  goods or services provided to unrelated parties are consistently priced at actual cost plus a fixed markup.  Testing is by comparison of the markup percentages.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 2.32-48, 26 CFR 1.482-3(d), 26 CFR 1.482-9(e).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Resale price method (RPM):  goods are regularly offered by a seller or purchased by a retailer to/from unrelated parties at a standard "list" price less a fixed discount.  Testing is by comparison of the discount percentages.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 2.14-2.31, 26 CFR 1.482-3(c), 26 CFR 1.482-9(d).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gross margin method:  similar to resale price method, recognised in a few systems.

====Profit-Based methods====
Some methods of testing prices do not rely on actual transactions.  Use of these methods may be necessary due to the lack of reliable data for transactional methods.  In some cases, non-transactional methods may be more reliable than transactional methods because market and economic adjustments to transactions may not be reliable.  These methods may include:
*Comparable profits method (CPM):  profit levels of similarly situated companies in similar industries may be compared to an appropriate tested party.&lt;ref&gt;26 CFR 1.482-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  See U.S. rules below.
*[[Transactional net margin method]] (TNMM):  while called a transactional method, the testing is based on profitability of similar businesses.  See OECD guidelines below.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 3.26-3.33.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Profit split method:  total enterprise profits are split in a formulary manner based on econometric analyses.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 3.5-3.25, [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:6.0.1.1.1.0.8.187&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.482-6].&lt;/ref&gt;

CPM and TNMM have a practical advantage in ease of implementation.  Both methods rely on microeconomic analysis of data rather than specific transactions. These methods are discussed further with respect to the U.S. and OECD systems.

Two methods are often provided for splitting profits:&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 3.5.&lt;/ref&gt;  comparable profit split&lt;ref&gt;26 CFR 1.482-6(c)(2).&lt;/ref&gt; and residual profit split.&lt;ref&gt;26 CFR 1.482-6(c)(3).&lt;/ref&gt;  The former requires that profit split be derived from the combined operating profit of uncontrolled taxpayers whose transactions and activities are comparable to the transactions and activities being tested.  The residual profit split method requires a two step process:  first profits are allocated to routine operations, then the residual profit is allocated based on nonroutine contributions of the parties.  The residual allocation may be based on external market benchmarks or estimation based on capitalised costs.

====Tested party and profit level indicator====
Where testing of prices occurs on other than a purely transactional basis, such as CPM or TNMM, it may be necessary to determine which of the two related parties should be tested.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 3.43, 26 CFR 1.482-5(b)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Testing is to be done of that party testing of which will produce the most reliable results.  Generally, this means that the tested party is that party with the most easily compared functions and risks.  Comparing the tested party's results to those of comparable parties may require adjustments to results of the tested party or the comparables for such items as levels of inventory or receivables.

Testing requires determination of what indication of profitability should be used.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 3.41, 26 CFR 1.482-5(b)(4).&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be net profit on the transaction, return on assets employed, or some other measure.  Reliability is generally improved for TNMM and CPM by using a range of results and multiple year data.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 3.43, 3.44, 26 CFR 1.482-1(e)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;
this is based on circumstances of the relevant countries.

===Intangible property issues===
Valuable intangible property tends to be unique.  Often there are no comparable items.  The value added by use of intangibles may be represented in prices of goods or services, or by payment of fees (royalties) for use of the intangible property.  Licensing of intangibles thus presents difficulties in identifying comparable items for testing.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Chapter VI, 26 CFR 1.482-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, where the same property is licensed to independent parties, such license may provide comparable transactional prices.  The profit split method specifically attempts to take value of intangibles into account.

===Services===
Enterprises may engage related or unrelated parties to provide services they need.  Where the required services are available within a multinational group, there may be significant advantages to the enterprise as a whole for components of the group to perform those services.  Two issues exist with respect to charges between related parties for services:  whether services were actually performed which warrant payment,&lt;ref name="PLR8806002"&gt;For the U.S., see, ''e.g.'', [http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/410/1233/154707/ ''Young and Rubicam'', 410 F.2d 1233 (Ct.Cl., 1969)], PLR 8806002.&lt;/ref&gt; and the price charged for such services.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 7.5, 26 CFR 1.482-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tax authorities in most major countries have, either formally or in practice, incorporated these queries into their examination of related party services transactions.

There may be tax advantages obtained for the group if one member charges another member for services, even where the member bearing the charge derives no benefit.  To combat this, the rules of most systems allow the tax authorities to challenge whether the services allegedly performed actually benefit the member charged.  The inquiry may focus on whether services were indeed performed as well as who benefited from the services.&lt;ref name="PLR8806002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 7.5-7.18&lt;/ref&gt;  For this purpose, some rules differentiate stewardship services from other services.  Stewardship services are generally those that an investor would incur for its own benefit in managing its investments.  Charges to the investee for such services are generally inappropriate.  Where services were not performed or where the related party bearing the charge derived no direct benefit, tax authorities may disallow the charge altogether.

Where the services were performed and provided benefit for the related party bearing a charge for such services, tax rules also permit adjustment to the price charged.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 7.19 ''et seq''., 26 CFR 1.482-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rules for testing prices of services may differ somewhat from rules for testing prices charged for goods due to the inherent differences between provision of services and sale of goods.  The OECD Guidelines provide that the provisions relating to goods should be applied with minor modifications and additional considerations.  In the U.S., a different set of price testing methods is provided for services.  In both cases, standards of comparability and other matters apply to both goods and services.

It is common for enterprises to perform services for themselves (or for their components) that support their primary business.  Examples include accounting, legal, and computer services for those enterprises not engaged in the business of providing such services.&lt;ref&gt;Such services may be referred to those not integral to the functioning of the primary business.&lt;/ref&gt;  Transfer pricing rules recognize that it may be inappropriate for a component of an enterprise performing such services for another component to earn a profit on such services.  Testing of prices charged in such case may be referred to a cost of services or services cost method.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 7.33, 26 CFR 1.482-9(b).&lt;/ref&gt;  Application of this method may be limited under the rules of certain countries, and is required in some countries e.g. Canada.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Where services performed are of a nature performed by the enterprise (or the performing or receiving component) as a key aspect of its business, OECD and U.S. rules provide that some level of profit is appropriate to the service performing component.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 7.29 ''et seq''., 26 CFR 1.482-9(b)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Canada's rules do not permit such profit.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Testing of prices in such cases generally follows one of the methods described above for goods.  The [[cost-plus]] method, in particular, may be favored by tax authorities and taxpayers due to ease of administration.

===Cost sharing===
Multi-component enterprises may find significant business advantage to sharing the costs of developing or acquiring certain assets, particularly intangible assets.  Detailed U.S. rules provide that members of a group may enter into a cost sharing agreement  (CSA) with respect to costs and benefits from the development of intangible assets.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Chapter VIII, [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:6.0.1.1.1.0.8.188&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.482-7T].&lt;/ref&gt;  OECD Guidelines provide more generalized suggestions to tax authorities for enforcement related to cost contribution agreements (CCAs) with respect to acquisition of various types of assets.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 8.3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both sets of rules generally provide that costs should be allocated among members based on respective anticipated benefits.  Inter-member charges should then be made so that each member bears only its share of such allocated costs.  Since the allocations must inherently be made based on expectations of future events, the mechanism for allocation must provide for prospective adjustments where prior projections of events have proved incorrect.  However, both sets of rules generally prohibit applying hindsight in making allocations.&lt;ref&gt;Note that few countries besides the U.S. have formally adopted cost sharing rules, as of 2009.  The OECD Guidelines do not specifically require such rules, so adoption of the Guidelines may not constitute approval of cost sharing under the laws of some countries.&lt;/ref&gt;

A key requirement to limit adjustments related to costs of developing intangible assets is that there must be a written agreement in place among the members.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. rules permit, in some cases, actions of members consistent with the principles of a CSA to be considered to constitute a CSA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tax rules may impose additional contractual, documentation, accounting, and reporting requirements on participants of a CSA or CCA, which vary by country.

Generally, under a CSA or CCA, each participating member must be entitled to use of some portion rights developed pursuant to the agreement without further payments.  Thus, a CCA participant should be entitled to use a process developed under the CCA without payment of royalties.  Ownership of the rights need not be transferred to the participants.  The division of rights is generally to be based on some observable measure, such as by geography.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 8.9, 26 CFR 1.482-7T(b)(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in CSAs and CCAs may contribute pre-existing assets or rights for use in the development of assets.  Such contribution may be referred to as a platform contribution.  Such contribution is generally considered a deemed payment by the contributing member, and is itself subject to transfer pricing rules or special CSA rules.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 8.16, 8.17, 26 CFR 1.482-7T(c).&lt;/ref&gt;

A key consideration in a CSA or CCA is what costs development or acquisition costs should be subject to the agreement.  This may be specified under the agreement, but is also subject to adjustment by tax authorities.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 8.13-8.18, 1.482-7T(c).&lt;/ref&gt;

In determining reasonably anticipated benefits, participants are forced to make projections of future events.  Such projections are inherently uncertain.  Further, there may exist uncertainty as to how such benefits should be measured.  One manner of determining such anticipated benefits is to project respective sales or gross margins of participants, measured in a common currency, or sales in units.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 8.8, 8.9, 26 CFR 1.482-7T(e).&lt;/ref&gt;

Both sets of rules recognize that participants may enter or leave a CSA or CCA.  Upon such events, the rules require that members make buy-in or buy-out payments.  Such payments may be required to represent the market value of the existing state of development, or may be computed under cost recovery or market capitalization models.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 8.31-8.39, 26 CFR 1.482-7T(g).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penalties and documentation===
Some jurisdictions impose significant penalties relating to transfer pricing adjustments by tax authorities.  These penalties may have thresholds for the basic imposition of penalty, and the penalty may be increased at other thresholds.  For example, U.S. rules impose a 20% penalty where the adjustment exceeds USD 5 million, increased to 40% of the additional tax where the adjustment exceeds USD 20 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6662-26 USC 6662].  A second threshold based on the relative magnitude of the adjustment may also applyl.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of many countries require taxpayers to document that prices charged are within the prices permitted under the transfer pricing rules.  Where such documentation is not timely prepared, penalties may be imposed, as above.  Documentation may be required to be in place prior to filing a tax return in order to avoid these penalties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:13.0.1.1.1.0.16.256&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.6662-6].&lt;/ref&gt;  Documentation by a taxpayer need not be relied upon by the tax authority in any jurisdiction permitting adjustment of prices.  Some systems allow the tax authority to disregard information not timely provided by taxpayers, including such advance documentation.  India requires that documentation not only be in place prior to filing a return, but also that the documentation be certified by the chartered accountant preparing a company return.

==U.S. specific tax rules==
U.S. transfer pricing rules are lengthy.&lt;ref&gt;basic rules through 2001 [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-apa/482_regs.pdf 26 CFR 1.482-0 through -8] plus the cost sharing ([http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:6.0.1.1.1.0.8.188&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.482-7]) and services ([http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:6.0.1.1.1.0.8.191&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.482-9]) regulations together exceed 120,000 words.&lt;/ref&gt;  They incorporate all of the principles above, using CPM (see below) instead of TNMM.  U.S. rules specifically provide that a taxpayer's intent to avoid or evade tax is not a prerequisite to adjustment by the [[Internal Revenue Service]], nor are [[nonrecognition provisions]].  The U.S. rules give no priority to any particular method of testing prices, requiring instead explicit analysis to determine the best method.  U.S. comparability standards limit use of adjustments for business strategies in testing prices to clearly defined market share strategies, but permit limited consideration of location savings.

===Comparable profits method===
The Comparable Profits method (CPM)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:6.0.1.1.1.0.8.186&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.482-5].&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced in the 1992 proposed regulations and has been a prominent feature of IRS transfer pricing practice since.  Under CPM, the tested party's overall results, rather than its transactions, are compared with the overall results of similarly situated enterprises for whom reliable data is available.  Comparisons are made for the profit level indicator that most reliably represents profitability for the type of business.  For example, a sales company's profitability may be most reliably measured as a return on sales (pre-tax profit as a percent of sales).

CPM inherently requires lower levels of comparability in the nature of the goods or services.  Further, data used for CPM generally can be readily obtained in the U.S. and many countries through public filings of comparable enterprises.

Results of the tested party or comparable enterprises may require adjustment to achieve comparability.  Such adjustments may include effective interest adjustments for customer financing or debt levels, inventory adjustments, etc.

===Cost plus and resale price issues===
U.S. rules apply resale price method and [[cost-plus]] with respect to goods strictly on a transactional basis.&lt;ref&gt;26 CFR 1.482-3(c)(2) and (d)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, comparable transactions must be found for all tested transactions in order to apply these methods.  Industry averages or statistical measures are not permitted.  Where a manufacturing entity provides contract manufacturing for both related and unrelated parties, it may readily have reliable data on comparable transactions.  However, absent such in-house comparables, it is often difficult to obtain reliable data for applying [[cost-plus]].

The rules on services expand [[cost-plus]], providing an additional option to mitigate these data problems.&lt;ref&gt;26 CFR 1.482-9(c)&lt;/ref&gt;  Charges to related parties for services not in the primary business of either the tested party or the related party group are rebuttably presumed to be arm's length if priced at cost plus zero (the services cost method).  Such services may include back-room operations (e.g., accounting and data processing services for groups not engaged in providing such services to clients), product testing, or a variety of such non-integral services.  This method is not permitted for manufacturing, reselling, and certain other services that typically are integral to a business.

U.S. rules also specifically permit shared services agreements.&lt;ref&gt;26 CFR 1.482-9(c).&lt;/ref&gt;  Under such agreements, various group members may perform services which benefit more than one member.  Prices charged are considered arm's length where the costs are allocated in a consistent manner among the members based on reasonably anticipated benefits.  For instance, shared services costs may be allocated among members based on a formula involving expected or actual sales or a combination of factors.

===Terms between parties===
Under U.S. rules, actual conduct of the parties is more important than contractual terms.  Where the conduct of the parties differs from terms of the contract, the IRS has authority to deem the actual terms to be those needed to permit the actual conduct.&lt;ref name="cfr"&gt;26 CFR 1.482-.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adjustments===
U.S. rules require that the IRS may not adjust prices found to be within the arm's length range.&lt;ref name="cfr" /&gt;  Where prices charged are outside that range, prices may be adjusted by the IRS unilaterally to the midpoint of the range.  The burden of proof that a transfer pricing adjustment by the IRS is incorrect is on the taxpayer unless the IRS adjustment is shown to be arbitrary and capricious.  However, the courts have generally required that both taxpayers and the IRS to demonstrate their facts where agreement is not reached.

===Documentation and penalties===
If the IRS adjusts prices by more than $5 million or 10 percent of the taxpayer’s gross receipts, penalties apply.  The penalty is 20% of the amount of the tax adjustment, increased to 40% at a higher threshold.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6662- 26 USC 6662] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426064925/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6662- |date=2010-04-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This penalty may be avoided only if the taxpayer maintains contemporaneous documentation meeting requirements in the regulations, and provides such documentation to the IRS within 30 days of IRS request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:13.0.1.1.1.0.16.256&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.6662-6(d)(2)(iii)].&lt;/ref&gt;  If documentation is not provided at all, the IRS may make adjustments based on any information it has available.  Contemporaneous means the documentation existed with 30 days of filing the taxpayer's tax return.  Documentation requirements are quite specific, and generally require a best method analysis and detailed support for the pricing and methodology used for testing such pricing.  To qualify, the documentation must reasonably support the prices used in computing tax.

===Commensurate with income standard===
U.S. tax law requires that the foreign transferee/user of intangible property (patents, processes, trademarks, know-how, etc.) will be deemed to pay to a controlling transferor/developer a royalty commensurate with the income derived from using the intangible property.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/367- 26 USC 367(d)] and [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:4.0.1.1.1.0.13.147&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.367(d)-1T].&lt;/ref&gt;  This applies whether such royalty is actually paid or not.  This requirement may result in [[withholding tax]] on deemed payments for use of intangible property in the U.S.

==OECD specific tax rules==
OECD guidelines are voluntary for member nations.  Some nations have adopted the guidelines almost unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;German law incorporates OECD guidelines by reference.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Note that while Canada and the United States are OECD members, each has adopted its own comprehensive regulations that differ in some material respects from the OECD guidelines.&lt;/ref&gt;  Terminology may vary between adopting nations, and may vary from that used above.

OECD guidelines give priority to transactional methods, described as the "most direct way" to establish comparability.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 2.5.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Transactional Net Margin Method and Profit Split methods are used either as methods of last resort or where traditional transactional methods cannot be reliably applied.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 3.50-3.51&lt;/ref&gt;  CUP is not given priority among transactional methods in OECD guidelines.  The Guidelines state, "It may be difficult to find a transaction between independent enterprises that is similar enough to a controlled transaction such that no differences have a material effect on price."&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 2.8&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, adjustments are often required to either tested prices or uncontrolled process.

===Comparability standards===
OECD rules permit consideration of business strategies in determining if results or transactions are comparable.  Such strategies include market penetration, expansion of market share, cost or location savings, etc.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.31-1.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transactional net margin method===
The transactional net margin method (TNMM)&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 3.26 ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt; compares the net profitability of a transaction, or group or aggregation of transactions, to that of another transaction, group or aggregation.  Under TNMM, use of actual, verifiable transactions is given strong preference.  However, in practice TNMM allows making computations for company-level aggregates of transactions.  Thus, TNMM may in some circumstances function like U.S. CPM.

===Terms===
Contractual terms and transactions between parties are to be respected under OECD rules unless both the substance of the transactions differs materially from those terms and following such terms would impede tax administration.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.28-29, 1.37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adjustments===
OECD rules generally do not permit tax authorities to make adjustments if prices charged between related parties are within the arm's length range.  Where prices are outside such range, the prices may be adjusted to the most appropriate point.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.45-1.48&lt;/ref&gt;  The burden of proof of the appropriateness of an adjustment is generally on the tax authority.

===Documentation===
OECD Guidelines do not provide specific rules on the nature of taxpayer documentation.  Such matters are left to individual member nations.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 4.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==EU==
In 2002, the European Union created the [[EU Joint Transfer Pricing Forum]]. The Communication on "Tax and Development – Cooperating with Developing Countries in Promoting Good Governance in Tax Matters‟, COM (2010) 163 final, highlighted the need to support developing countries' capacity in mobilizing domestic resources for development in line with the principles of good governance in taxation. In this context, PwC prepared the report ''Transfer pricing and developing countries''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/common/publications/studies/transfer_pricing_dev_countries.pdf Transfer pricing and developing countries, 15. July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many EU countries are currently implementing the OECD Guidelines for Transfer Pricing. The latest adopter is Cyprus which issued a ruling in 2017 for financial arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.transferpricing.com.cy|title=Home - TransferPricing|website=TransferPricing|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China specific tax rules==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}
Prior to 2009, China generally followed OECD Guidelines.  New guidelines were announced by the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) in March 2008 and issued in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Implementation Measures of Special Tax Adjustment (Trial), Guo Shui Fa (2009) No. 2 [Circular 2, as revised] issued by the [http://www.chinatax.gov.cn/n6669073/index.html State Administration of Taxation] of the People's Republic of China, in Chinese.  English translations are available from most of the major accounting firms, and vary slightly.  See, e.g., [http://www.kpmg.com/CN/en/WhatWeDo/Tax/Global-Transfer-Pricing-Services/Documents/Circular-20090108-0002-1e.pdf KPMG]'s version of the complete circular.  Hereafter referred to as the Circular or China Circular 2 Art. xx, where xx is the article number of Circular 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  These guidelines differed materially in approach from those in other countries in two principal ways:  1) they were guidelines issued instructing field offices how to conduct transfer pricing examinations and adjustments, and 2) factors to be examined differed by transfer pricing method.  The guidelines covered:
*Administrative matters
*Required taxpayer filings and documentation
*General transfer pricing principles, including comparability
*Guidelines on how to conduct examinations
*Advance pricing and cost sharing agreement administration
*Controlled foreign corporation examinations
*Thin capitalization
*General anti-avoidance
On September 17, 2015, the SAT released a revised draft version of the "Implementation Measures for Special Tax Adjustment (Circular 2)," which replaced the previous 2009 guidelines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2015/10/23/china-releases-new-draft-transfer-pricing-documentation-rules.html|title=China Releases New Draft of Transfer Pricing Documentation Rules|last=Yao|first=Rainy|date=2015-10-23|website=China Briefing|publisher=China Briefing|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three new sections were introduced under the revised draft: monitoring and management, intangible transactions/intra-group services and a new approach to transfer pricing documentation.

===Documentation===
Under the 2009 Circular, taxpayers must disclose related party transactions when filing tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;China Circular 2 Art. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the circular provides for a three-tier set of documentation and reporting standards, based on the aggregate amount of intercompany transactions.  Taxpayers affected by the rules who engaged in intercompany transactions under RMB 20 million for the year were generally exempted from reporting, documentation, and penalties.  Those with transactions exceeding RMB 200 million generally were required to complete transfer pricing studies in advance of filing tax returns.&lt;ref&gt;China Circular 2 Art. 13-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  For taxpayers in the top tier, documentation must include a comparability analysis and justification for the transfer pricing method chosen.&lt;ref&gt;China Circular 2 Art. 14 (iv) and (v).&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 draft introduced an overhauled three-tiered standardized approach to transfer pricing documentation. The tiers vary in documentation content and include the master file, the local file, and the country-by-country report. The draft also requires companies involved with related-party service transactions, cost sharing agreements or thin capitalization to submit a so-called "Special File."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===General principles===
Chinese transfer pricing rules apply to transactions between a Chinese business and domestic and foreign related parties.  A related party includes enterprises meeting one of eight different tests, including 25% equity ownership in common, overlapping boards or management, significant debt holdings, and other tests.  Transactions subject to the guidelines include most sorts of dealings businesses may have with one another.&lt;ref&gt;China Circular 2 Art. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Circular instructs field examiners to review taxpayer's comparability and method analyses.  The method of analyzing comparability and what factors are to be considered varies slightly by type of transfer pricing analysis method.  The guidelines for CUP include specific functions and risks to be analyzed for each type of transaction (goods, rentals, licensing, financing, and services).  The guidelines for resale price, [[cost-plus]], transactional net margin method, and profit split are short and very general.

===Cost sharing===
The China rules provide a general framework for cost sharing agreements.&lt;ref&gt;China Circular 2 Art. 64, ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes a basic structure for agreements, provision for buy-in and exit payments based on reasonable amounts, minimum operating period of 20 years, and mandatory notification of the SAT within 30 days of concluding the agreement.

==Agreements between taxpayers and governments and dispute resolution==
Tax authorities of most major countries have entered into unilateral or multilateral agreements between taxpayers and other governments regarding the setting or testing of related party prices.  These agreements are referred to as '''advance pricing agreements''' or '''advance pricing arrangements''' (APAs).  Under an APA, the taxpayer and one or more governments agree on the methodology used to test prices.  APAs are generally based on transfer pricing documentation prepared by the taxpayer and presented to the government(s).  Multilateral agreements require negotiations between the governments, conducted through their designated '''competent authority''' groups.  The agreements are generally for some period of years, and may have retroactive effect.  Most such agreements are not subject to public disclosure rules.  Rules controlling how and when a taxpayer or tax authority may commence APA proceedings vary by jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;See OECD Guidelines 4.124 ''et seq''.; U.S. IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-apa/rp-08-31.pdf Rev. Proc. 2008-31]; China Circular 2 Art. 46 ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic theory==
[[File:price trans-no ext-small.jpg|thumb|175px|Transfer Pricing with No External Market]]
The discussion in this section explains an economic theory behind '''optimal transfer pricing''' with ''optimal'' defined as transfer pricing that maximizes overall firm profits in a non-realistic world with no [[taxation|taxes]], no [[Equity (finance)|capital risk]], no [[Business development|development]] risk, no [[externality|externalities]] or any other frictions which exist in the real world. In practice a great many factors influence the transfer prices that are used by [[multinational corporation]]s, including [[performance measurement]], capabilities of [[accounting system]]s, [[import quotas]], [[customs duties]], [[Value added tax|VAT]], [[Corporate tax|taxes on profits]], and (in many cases) simple lack of attention to the [[pricing]].

From [[Marginal utility#Marginalist theory|marginal price determination theory]], the optimum level of output is that where marginal cost equals [[marginal revenue]]. That is to say, a firm should expand its output as long as the marginal revenue from additional sales is greater than their marginal costs. In the diagram that follows, this intersection is represented by point A, which will yield a price of P*, given the demand at point B.

When a firm is selling some of its product to itself, and only to itself (i.e. there is no external market for that particular transfer good), then the picture gets more complicated, but the outcome remains the same. The demand curve remains the same. The optimum price and quantity remain the same. But marginal cost of production can be separated from the firm's total marginal costs. Likewise, the marginal revenue associated with the production division can be separated from the marginal revenue for the total firm. This is referred to as the [[Profit maximization#Marginal cost-marginal revenue method|Net Marginal Revenue]] in production (NMR) and is calculated as the marginal revenue from the firm minus the marginal costs of distribution.
[[File:price trans-comp ext-small.jpg|thumb|175px|Transfer Pricing with a Competitive External Market]]
It can be shown algebraically that the intersection of the firm's marginal cost curve and marginal revenue curve (point A) must occur at the same quantity as the intersection of the production division's marginal cost curve with the net marginal revenue from production (point C).

If the production division is able to sell the transfer good in a competitive market (as well as internally), then again both must operate where their marginal costs equal their marginal revenue, for profit maximization. Because the external market is competitive, the firm is a price taker and must accept the transfer price determined by market forces (their marginal revenue from transfer and demand for transfer products becomes the transfer price). If the market price is relatively high (as in Ptr1 in the next diagram), then the firm will experience an internal surplus (excess internal supply) equal to the amount Qt1 minus Qf1. The actual marginal cost curve is defined by points A,C,D.
[[File:price trans-imperf ext-small.jpg|thumb|250px|Transfer Pricing with an Imperfect External Market]]

If the firm is able to sell its transfer goods in an imperfect market, then it need not be a price taker. There are two markets each with its own price (Pf and Pt in the next diagram). The aggregate market is constructed from the first two. That is, point C is a horizontal summation of points A and B (and likewise for all other points on the Net Marginal Revenue curve (NMRa)). The total optimum quantity (Q) is the sum of Qf plus Qt.

==Alternative approaches to profit allocation ==
A frequently-proposed&lt;ref&gt;OECD Guidelines 1.16-1.32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S.|first=Avi-Yonah, Reuven|date=2010-01-01|title=Between Formulary Apportionment and the OECD Guidelines: A Proposal for Reconciliation|url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/articles/1181/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; alternative to arm's-length principle-based transfer pricing rules is [[formulary apportionment]], under which corporate profits are allocated according to objective metrics of activity such as sales, employees, or fixed assets. Some countries (including Canada and the United States) allocate taxing rights among their political subdivisions in this way, and it has recommended by the European Commission for use within the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krchniva|first=Katerina|year=2014|title=Comparison of European, Canadian and U.S. Formula Apportionment on Real Data|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2212-5671(14)00350-5|journal=Procedia Economics and Finance|volume=12|pages=309-318|via=Elsevier ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-3488_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - Questions and Answers on the package of corporate tax reforms|website=europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief, filed by the attorneys general of Alaska, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon in support of the state of California in the  [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case of ''Barclays Bank PLC v. Franchise Tax Board,'' the formulary apportionment method, which is also known as the unitary apportionment method, has at least three major advantages over the separate accounting system when applied to multi-jurisdictional businesses. First, the unitary method captures the added wealth and value resulting from economic interdependencies of multistate and multinational corporations through their functional integration, centralization of management, and [[economies of scale]]. A unitary business also benefits from more intangible values shared among its constituent parts, such as reputation, good will, customers and other business relationships. See, e.g., Mobil, 445 U.S. at 438-40; Container, 463 U.S. at 164-65. 

Separate accounting, with its emphasis on carving out of the overall business only income from sources within a single state, ignores the value attributable to the integrated nature of the business. Yet, to a large degree, the wealth, power, and profits of the world's large multinational enterprises are attributable to the very fact that they are integrated, unitary businesses. Hellerstein Treatise, P8.03 at 8-32.n9 As one commentator has explained: To believe that multinational corporations do not maintain an advantage over independent corporations operating within a similar business sphere is to ignore the economic and political strength of the multinational giants. By attempting to treat those businesses which are in fact unitary as independent entities, separate accounting "operates in a universe of pretense; as in Alice in Wonderland, it turns reality into fancy and then pretends it is the real world"

Because countries impose different [[corporate tax|corporate tax rates]], a corporation that has a goal of minimizing the overall taxes to be paid will set transfer prices to allocate more of the worldwide profit to lower tax countries. Many countries attempt to impose penalties on corporations if the countries consider that they are being deprived of taxes on otherwise taxable profit. However, since the participating countries are sovereign entities, obtaining data and initiating meaningful actions to limit tax avoidance is hard.&lt;ref&gt;Ronen Palan (2010): The Offshore World: Sovereign markets, Virtual Places, and Nomad Millionaires; Cornell University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A publication of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) states, "Transfer prices are significant for both taxpayers and tax administrations because they determine in large part the income and expenses, and therefore taxable profits, of associated enterprises in different tax jurisdictions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/taxation/oecd-transfer-pricing-guidelines-for-multinational-enterprises-and-tax-administrations-2010_tpg-2010-en#.WDT1m9UrKpo|title=Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations" at paragraph 12, hereinafter "OECD xx," where "xx" is the cited paragraph number.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
