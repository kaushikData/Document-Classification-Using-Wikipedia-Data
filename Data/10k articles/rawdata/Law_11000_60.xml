'''Aligarh Muslim University Act''' was enacted in the year 1920 by the imperial legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graff|first=Violette|date=1990-01-01|title=Aligarh's Long Quest for 'Minority' Status: AMU (Amendment) Act, 1981|jstor=4396615|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=25|issue=32|pages=1771–1781}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was amended in 1951 in order to do away with the Islamic teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/aligarh-muslim-university-not-a-minority-institution-govt-tells-sc/story-GYMtOZvFhTSFtiEAlTTJaL.html|title=Aligarh Muslim University not a minority institution: Govt tells SC|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was amended in 1967 which was challenged in Azeez Basha case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/government-to-not-support-minority-status-for-aligarh-muslim-university-1338715|title=Government To Not Support Minority Status For Aligarh Muslim University|website=NDTV.com|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 [[Allahabad High Court]] quashed Aligarh Muslim University Amendment Act, 1981, was unconstitutional and that the AMU was not a minority institution and, therefore, the notification issued by the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development|Human Resource Development Ministry]] on February, permitting the university to reserve seats for Muslims in post-graduate medical courses was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2005/11/26/stories/2005112621950100.htm|title=The Hindu : Front Page : Aligarh Muslim University withdraws SLP|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minority status ==
The Act is more or less into lime because of the debate on whether the [[Aligarh Muslim University]] was a minority status or not? It is under scrutiny of the [[Supreme Court of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/amu-row-centre-to-withdraw-upas-appeal-push-for-non-minority-status/1/634704.html|title=AMU row: Centre to withdraw UPAs appeal, push for non-minority status|website=indiatoday.intoday.in|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMU was declared a minority institution by the AMU Amendment Act in 1981 by the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/govt-stand-on-amu-heats-up-debate-over-minority-status-of-the-university/|title=Govt stand on AMU heats up debate over minority status of the university|date=2016-04-05|website=The Indian Express|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Allahabad High Court ruled in 2005 that AMU Amendment act of 2005 is unconstitutional.  The then [[United Progressive Alliance|UPA government]] went in appeal to Supreme Court.  However, the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|NDA Government]] has withdrawn this in 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5588">The '''American Arbitration Association''' ('''AAA''') is a not-for-profit organization  in the field of alternative [[dispute resolution]], providing services to individuals and organizations who wish to resolve conflicts out of court, and one of several [[arbitration]] organizations that administers arbitration proceedings. The AAA also administers [[mediation]] through '''Mediation.org''' and other forms of [[alternative dispute resolution]]. It is headquartered in [[New York City]], with regional offices in [[Atlanta]], [[Boston]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], [[Denver]], [[Detroit]], [[East Providence, Rhode Island]], [[Fresno]], [[Houston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Miami]], [[Minneapolis]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[San Antonio]], [[San Diego]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Somerset, New Jersey]] and [[Washington, DC]].

The '''International Centre for Dispute Resolution''' ('''ICDR'''), established in 1996 by the AAA, administers [[international arbitration]] proceedings initiated under the institution's rules.  ICDR currently ({{As of|2018|lc=on}}) has offices in [[New York City]], [[Mexico City]], [[Singapore]], and [[Bahrain]].

The AAA provides services and online tools for Employer's General Counsel to create contracts of adhesion during all stages of hiring, employment, and post-employment favorable to those clients. They provide information demonstrating economic incentive for their Corporate clients to do so. They provide no information whatsoever for those to be brought under those contracts of adhesion. At the time of dispute they administer the selection of "neutral" arbitrators. They provide further information regarding the possibly legal destruction of documents and minimum retention of mandatory records according the "Sedona Principles" of eDiscovery.

== History ==
The AAA was founded in 1926 by the merger of the Arbitration Society of America and the Arbitration Foundation to provide dispute resolution and avoid [[Civil Court]] proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/org/557/000117206/ Notable Names Database]- Retrieved 2012-03-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[contract]]s include an [[arbitration clause]] naming the AAA as the organization that will administer arbitration between the parties. The AAA does not itself arbitrate disputes, but provides administrative support to arbitrations before a single arbitrator or a panel of three arbitrators. The arbitrators are chosen in accordance with the parties' agreement or, if the parties do not agree otherwise, in accordance with the AAA rules. Under its rules, the AAA may appoint an arbitrator in some circumstances, for example, where the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator or a party fails to exercise its right to appoint an arbitrator.

The AAA role in the dispute resolution process is to administer cases, from filing to closing. The AAA provides administrative services in the U.S., as well as abroad through the ICDR. The AAA's and ICDR's administrative services include assisting in the appointment of mediators and arbitrators, setting hearings, conducting cases under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Arbitration Rules, and providing users with information on dispute resolution options, including settlement through mediation. Ultimately, the AAA aims to move cases through arbitration or mediation in a fair and impartial manner until completion.

Additional AAA services include the design and development of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) systems for corporations, unions, government agencies, law firms, and the courts. The Association also provides elections services as well as education, training, and publications for those seeking an understanding of alternative dispute resolution.

In July 2009, the AAA stopped accepting consumer debt collection cases, after the [[National Arbitration Forum]] was forced to do so after questions arose about the fairness of its process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=106894662 Top Arbitration d Firms Exit Business] by [[Wade Goodwyn]] and Madeleine Brand.  All Things Considered, National Public Radio.  22 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, the New York State Department of Financial Services hired the AAA to host mediation sessions between insurance companies and [[Hurricane Sandy]] victims.

The AAA has actively promoted the use of mediation around the world, including through its participation as a co-founder in 2007 and current board member of the Netherlands-based [[International Mediation Institute]].

The '''Arkansas Medical Cannabis Act''' (AMCA) is a proposed legislative act to appear on the 2016 general election ballot as an [[initiative]] in the U.S. state of [[Arkansas]]. According to a 2015 survey, 84% of Arkansas voters favored medical cannabis legalization, leading some to conclude passage of the 2016 act is likely.&lt;ref name=Shortt/&gt; The act has a provision to collect sales tax and apportions some of the revenue to subsidize low-income [[medical cannabis]] patients.&lt;ref name=Dunnagan/&gt;

==History==
The wording of the initiative's title was approved by the Arkansas Attorney General in August, 2014, allowing the process of collecting signatures for the initiative to begin.&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt; The sponsor of the act, Arkansans for Compassionate Care, submitted 117,469 petition signatures to the state authorities for verification in June, 2016.&lt;ref name=AP20160621/&gt; It was certified for the ballot on July 7.&lt;ref name=AP20160707/&gt;

{{Judicial remedies}}
'''Asset freezing''' is a legal process which prevents a [[defendant]] (usually an apparent fraudster){{sfn|McGowan|Crerar|2010|p=1}} to an [[lawsuit|action]] from dissipating their [[asset]]s from beyond the [[jurisdiction]] of a court so as to frustrate a potential [[Judgment (law)|judgment]]. It is widely recognised in other common law jurisdictions{{sfn|Collins|1989|p=271}} and such orders can be made to have world-wide effect. It is variously construed as part of a court's inherent jurisdiction to restrain [[abuse of process|breaches of its process]].

The jurisdiction arises in part from the [[Judicature Act 1873]], which provided that "A mandamus or an injunction may be granted or a receiver appointed by an interlocutory Order of the Court in all cases in which it shall appear to the Court to be just or convenient..." Relying on this, [[George Jessel (jurist)|Jessel MR]] in 1878 declared, "I have unlimited power to grant an injunction in any case where it would be right or just to do so..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Beddow v Beddow|vol= (1879) 9|reporter= Ch D|opinion= 89|pinpoint= 93|court= Ch D|date= 17 April 1878|url= https://books.google.ca/books?id=MBUtAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA787&amp;ots=r3JQyPD4hx&amp;pg=PA786#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate= |quote=}}, quoted in {{cite court |litigants= Mareva Compania Naviera SA v. International Bulkcarriers SA|vol= &amp;#91;1975&amp;#93; 2|reporter= Lloyd's Rep|opinion= 509|pinpoint= |court= C.A.|date= 23 June 1975|url= http://www.uniset.ca/other/cs4/19801AER213.html|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins in ''Mareva''==
The legal order itself is in the form of an [[injunction]], which in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions is also known as a '''freezing order''', '''Mareva injunction''', '''Mareva order''' or '''Mareva regime''', after the case ''Mareva Compania Naviera SA v International Bulkcarriers SA'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Mareva Compania Naviera SA v. International Bulkcarriers SA|vol= &amp;#91;1975&amp;#93; 2|reporter= Lloyd's Rep|opinion= 509|pinpoint= |court= C.A.|date= 23 June 1975|url= http://www.uniset.ca/other/cs4/19801AER213.html|accessdate= |quote=}}, [1980] 1 All ER 213&lt;/ref&gt; although the first recorded instance of such an order in English jurisprudence was ''Nippon Yusen Kaisha v Karageorgis'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Nippon Yusen Kaisha v Karageorgis|vol= [1975] 1|reporter= WLR|opinion= 1093|pinpoint= |court= C.A.|date= |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}, [1975] 3 All ER 282&lt;/ref&gt; decided one month before ''Mareva''. The ''[[Civil Procedure Rules 1998]]'' now define a Mareva injunction as a "freezing order".

Asset freezing is not a security,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Jackson v Sterling Industries Ltd|link=|court=HCA|num=23|year=1987|pinpoint=|parallelcite=(1987) 162 CLR 612|date=11 June 1987|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor a means to pressure a judgment debtor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Camdex International Ltd v Bank of Zambia (No. 2)|vol= [1997] 1|reporter= WLR|opinion= 632|pinpoint= |court= |date= |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor is it a type of [[asset forfeiture]] since it does not confer upon anyone else a [[Ownership|proprietary interest]] in the defendant's assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Cretanor Maritime Co Ltd v Irish Marine Management Ltd|vol= [1978] 1|reporter= WLR|opinion= 966|pinpoint= |court= |date= |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authorities have treated the Mareva injunction as an order to stop a judgment debtor from dissipating his assets so as to have the effect of frustrating judgment, rather than the more strenuous test of requiring an intent to abuse court procedure. An example of the former would be paying off a legitimate debt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Iraqi Ministry of Defence v Arcepey Shipping Co. S.A. ("The Angel Bell") |vol= [1981] 1|reporter= QB|opinion= 65|pinpoint= |court= |date= |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas an example of the latter would be hiding the assets in overseas banks on receiving notice of the action.

A freezing order will usually only be made where the claimant can show that there was at least a good arguable case that they would succeed at trial and that the refusal of an injunction would involve a real risk that a judgment or award in their favour would remain unsatisfied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Ninemia Maritime Corporation v Trave Schiffahrtgesellschaft mbH und Co KG ("The Niedersachsen") |vol= [1983] 1|reporter= WLR|opinion= 1412|pinpoint= |court= |date= |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recognised as being quite harsh on defendants because the order is often granted at the pre-trial stage in ''[[ex parte]]'' hearings, based on [[affidavit]] evidence alone.

A Mareva injunction is often combined with an [[Anton Piller order]] in these circumstances. This can be disastrous for a defendant as the cumulative effect of these orders can be to destroy the whole of a business' custom by freezing most of its assets and revealing important information to its competitors, and the two orders have been described by [[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington|Lord Donaldson]] as being the law's "nuclear weapons."&lt;ref&gt;''Bank Mellat v Nikpour'', [1985] FSR 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Hefin Rees|title = Freezing Injunctions: A Nuclear Weapon For the Commercial Litigator|url = http://hefinrees.wordpress.com/2010/04/20/freezing-injunctions-weapon-for-commercial-litigator/|at = par. 2|date = 8 December 2009|publisher = Hefin Rees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application===
While it is not advisable to obtain such an order on purely strategic grounds,{{sfn|McGowan|Crerar|2010|p=1}} asset freezing has a persuasive effect on settlement negotiations.{{sfn|McGowan|Crerar|2010|pp=1{{endash}}2}} While a claimant obtaining an order can expect to face subsequent opposition in court from the defendant, the freezing order is generally considered to be the beginning of the end for the defendant,{{sfn|McGowan|Crerar|2010|p=4}} and negotiation and settlement avoid the return to court.{{sfn|McGowan|Crerar|2010|p=4}}

Current orders issued by the court do not generally call for a blanket freezing of assets, and they are currently worded in more nuanced terms according to the situation concerned.{{sfn|McGowan|Crerar|2010|p=4}}

The process is regarded as a high-stakes exercise for several reasons:{{sfn|McGowan|Crerar|2010|pp=5{{endash}}7}}

#The application is almost always made without notice, to prevent the fraudster defendant from spiriting away their assets before the freezing order is granted. Applicant’s counsel is therefore required to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts, and the applicable law, to the court.
#As with most injunctions, the applicant must provide an undertaking to the court to compensate the defendant for any damage caused by the order.
#A freezing order that is improperly or sloppily obtained, or one that is drafted too broadly or imprecisely, will cost the party, and its counsel, heavily in terms of credibility with the court.

===United States===
''Mareva'' was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1999 in ''Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc''.&lt;ref&gt;''Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc.'', {{ussc|527|308|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the majority, [[Justice Scalia]] held that, as such jurisdiction did not exist at the time of the passage of the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], the federal courts had no authority to exercise it. In dissent, [[Justice Ginsburg]] asserted that the federal courts' exercise of its equity jurisdiction was never that static. While ''Grupo Mexicano'' is consistent with other Supreme Court jurisprudence in the matter of [[preliminary injunction]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= DiSarro|first= Anthony|year= 2011|title= Freeze Frame: The Supreme Court’s Reaffirmation of the Substantive Principles of Preliminary Injunctions |url= https://www.law.gonzaga.edu/law-review/files/2011/12/DiSarro.final_.pdf|journal= Gonzaga Law Review|publisher= [[Gonzaga University School of Law]]|volume= 47|issue= 1|pages= 51{{endash}}98|doi= |accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been debate as to whether this decision should be reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Capper |first=David |year=2005 |title=The Need for ''Mareva'' Injunctions Reconsidered |url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol73/iss5/8/ |journal=[[Fordham Law Review]] |publisher= |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=2161{{endash}}2181 |doi= |accessdate=4 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the state level, the [[New York Court of Appeals]] reached a similar conclusion to that of the Supreme Court in 2000, in ''Credit Agricole v. Rossiyskiy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Credit Agricole Indosuez v. Rossiyskiy Kredit Bank|vol= 94|reporter= N.Y.2d|opinion= 541|pinpoint= |court= N.Y.|date= 2000|url= http://www.leagle.com/decision/200063594NY2d541_1584.xml/CREDIT%20AGRICOLE%20v.%20ROSSIYSKIY|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In place of ''Mareva'', US civil jurisprudence relies more on [[Prejudgment writ of attachment|prejudgment writs of attachment]],&lt;ref&gt;available under [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|FRCP]] §{{frcp|64}}&lt;/ref&gt; preliminary injunctions and [[temporary restraining order]]s,&lt;ref&gt;the latter two available under [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|FRCP]] §{{frcp|65}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have a more limited scope of application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=  Tamaruya|first= Masayuki|year= 2010|title= The Anglo-American Perspective on Freezing Injunctions|url= http://works.bepress.com/tamaruya/1/|journal= Civil Justice Quarterly|publisher= |volume= 29|issue= 3|pages= 350{{endash}}369|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of order==
Although it is mistakenly believed that a freezing injunction provides security over the defendant’s assets for a possible judgment, or secures a judgment already obtained, [[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington|Lord Donaldson MR]] explained in ''Polly Peck International Plc v Nadir'' that such is not the case:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Polly Peck International Plc v Nadir|link=|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1992|num=3|parallelcite= [1992] 4 All ER 769|date=19 March 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|
#So far as it lies in their power, the courts will not permit the course of justice to be frustrated by a defendant taking action, the purpose of which is to render nugatory or less effective any judgment or order which the plaintiff may thereafter obtain.
#It is not the purpose of a ''Mareva'' injunction to prevent a defendant acting as he would have acted in the absence of a claim against him. Whilst a defendant who is a natural person can and should be enjoined from indulging in a spending spree undertaken with the intention of dissipating or reducing his assets before the day of judgment, he cannot be required to reduce his ordinary standard of living with a view to putting by sums to satisfy a judgment which may or may not be given in the future. Equally no defendant, whether a natural or a juridical person, can be enjoined in terms which will prevent him from carrying on his business in the ordinary way or from meeting his debts or other obligations as they come due prior to judgment being given in the action.
#Justice requires that defendants be free to incur and discharge obligations in respect of professional advice and assistance in resisting the plaintiff's claims.
#It is not the purpose of a ''Mareva'' injunction to render the plaintiff a secured creditor, although this may be the result if the defendant offers a third party guarantee or bond in order to avoid such an injunction being imposed.
#The approach called for by the decision in ''American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd|link=|court=UKHL|year=1975|num=1|parallelcite= [1975] AC 396|date=5 February 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; has, as such, no application to the grant or refusal of ''Mareva'' injunctions which proceed on principles which are quite different from those applicable to other interlocutory injunctions.
}}

In 2007, [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Lord Bingham]] declared:

{{cquote|
Mareva (or freezing) injunctions were from the beginning, and continue to be, granted for an important but limited purpose: to prevent a defendant dissipating his assets with the intention or effect of frustrating enforcement of a prospective judgment. They are not a proprietary remedy. They are not granted to give a claimant advance security for his claim, although they may have that effect. They are not an end in themselves. They are a supplementary remedy, granted to protect the efficacy of court proceedings, domestic or foreign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Fourie v. Le Roux &amp; Ors|link=|court=UKHL|year=2007|num=1|para=2|parallelcite= [2007] 1 All ER 1087|date=24 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

===Current scope===

In ''Group Seven'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Group Seven Ltd v Allied Investment Corporation Ltd &amp; Ors|link=|court=EWHC|division=Ch|year=2013|num=1509|para=63|date=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Hildyard (judge)|Hildyard J]] outlined the current scope of freezing orders that can be issued by the Court:

#It is designed to prevent injustice to a successful claimant by preserving assets and funds from being disposed of or dissipated before a judgment is satisfied.
#"His assets" refers to "assets belonging to that person, not to assets belonging to another person" and without words clearly extending the scope of the phrase "his assets", assets owned beneficially by someone else will not be subject to the freezing order.
#A freezing order is a precautionary measure taken urgently to protect the claimant against the risk of dissipation, disposal, reduction in value, or loss of assets pending a fuller examination as to what assets would in reality be available to the claimant for the purposes of enforcing a judgment.
#If the words are ambiguous, or admit of a more restrictive interpretation, so that it is arguable whether or not the assets in question fall within their scope, the court is unlikely to treat a dealing with such assets as a contempt of court.
#"Assets" also covers assets which are not in the legal ownership of the defendant but in respect of which the defendant "retains the power to direct how the assets should be dealt with."
#The phrase "his assets" is extended to include also "assets held by a foreign trust or a [[Anstalt|Liechtenstein Anstalt]]&lt;ref&gt;the nature of which is discussed in {{cite journal |last= Glos|first= George E.|date= 1984|title= The Analysis of a Tax Haven: The Liechtenstein Anstalt|jstor= 40705579|journal= The International Lawyer|publisher= [[American Bar Association]]|volume= 18|issue= 4|pages= 929{{endash}}955|issn=0020-7810}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the defendant retains beneficial ownership or effective control of the asset."
#It is clear that those words in the standard form do not extend to assets of which the defendant remains the legal owner but holds for the benefit of someone else.
#If it is desired and found appropriate to extend the scope of the injunction to assets held in trust (in the case of a façade or sham), additional wording must be included to make that clear, and the Court will only do this sparingly.
#As to piercing or lifting the corporate veil, ownership and control of a company are not themselves sufficient to provide justification for that course, even when no unconnected third party is involved and it might be perceived that the interests of justice would be served by it.
#Even where the circumstances are such as to justify the exceptional step of piercing or lifting the corporate veil, the effect is not to alter the beneficial ownership of the company's assets: it is simply to provide for such asset to be available in defined circumstances to the claimant.

In 2014, ''Lakatamia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Lakatamia Shipping Company Ltd v Su &amp; Ors|link=|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=2014|num=636|parallelcite=|date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized that the assets of a company wholly owned by a person subject to a freezing order are not automatically subject to the order. In that case, [[Colin Rimer|Rimer J]] noted:

{{cquote|
The owner is of course able to control the destiny of the company's assets. But that does not make them ''his'' assets... First, [the order] is still only concerned with dispositions of assets belonging beneficially to the defendant, which these assets do not. Secondly, Mr Su has no authority to instruct the companies how to deal with their assets. All he has is the power, as an agent of the company, to procure the company to make dispositions of its assets. Such dispositions, when made, are made in consequence of decisions made by the organs of the company. They are not dispositions made by the company in compliance with instructions from Mr Su. That may seem to be a somewhat formal distinction. But it is a valid one: only the ''companies'' have authority to deal with and dispose of their assets.&lt;ref&gt;''Lakatamia'', par. 51&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

However, the person's shares in the company are subject to it, and any conduct by him (not in the course of ordinary business) that diminishes the value of those shares will infringe that order.&lt;ref&gt;''Lakatamia'', par. 43, 53&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Chabra'' relief===
Subsequent jurisprudence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= T.S.B. Private Bank International SK v Chabra |vol= [1991] 1|reporter= WLR|opinion= 231|pinpoint= |court= |date= |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has extended the reach of freezing orders to third parties against whom there is no substantive cause of action, but where there is good reason to suppose that their assets may in truth be the assets of the defendant against whom a cause of action is asserted. This type of order is known as ''Chabra'' relief, and has been described as possessing certain characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;''PJSC Vseukrainskyi Aktsionernyl Bank v Maksimov &amp; Ors'', [http://www.7kbw.co.uk/media/uploaded_files/PJSC_Vseukrainskyi_Aktsionernyi_Bank_v_Maksimov_and_others.pdf &amp;#91;2013&amp;#93; EWHC 422 (Comm)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810161335/http://www.7kbw.co.uk/media/uploaded_files/PJSC_Vseukrainskyi_Aktsionernyi_Bank_v_Maksimov_and_others.pdf |date=2014-08-10 }}, mentioned at ''Lakatamia'', par. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

#It may be exercised where there is good reason to suppose that assets held in the name of a defendant against whom the claimant asserts no cause of action (the NCAD) would be amenable to some process, ultimately enforceable by the courts, by which the assets would be available to satisfy a judgment against a defendant whom the claimant asserts to be liable upon his substantive claim (the CAD).
#The test of "good reason to suppose" is that of a good arguable case.
#The jurisdiction will be exercised where it is just and convenient to do so.
#Assets will be treated as in truth the assets of the CAD if they are held as nominee or trustee for it as the [[Beneficial ownership|ultimate beneficial owner]]. 
#Substantial control by the CAD over the assets in the name of the NCAD is often a relevant consideration, but substantial control is not the test for the existence and exercise of the ''Chabra'' jurisdiction. It is relevant where there is a question of beneficial ownership, and where there is a real risk that assets may be dissipated in the absence of a freezing order.

===Available alternatives===

Depending on the circumstances, alternative types of orders may be more attractive to an applicant:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1= Shantanu Majumdar|author2= Christopher Buckley|title = Freezing Injunctions|url = http://www.radcliffechambers.com/media/Misc_Articles/Freezing_injunctions_-_revised_New.pdf|at= par. 30{{endash}}40|date = 17 May 2013|publisher = Radcliffe Chambers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#orders preserving property or securing a specified fund (where the balance of convenience favours making such an order),
#a proprietary injunction (i.e., one that covers a specific asset or assets, as opposed to the defendant's assets in general),
#the appointment of a receiver to hold assets of the defendant (where the injunction is insufficient on its own and where there is a measurable risk that a defendant will act in breach of the injunction), or
#the appointment of a provisional liquidator (where the applicant is likely to obtain a winding-up order on the hearing of the petition).

A "third party debt order" (which consists of an interim freezing order and a final order requiring the third party to pay the debt to the judgment creditor) is available to secure payment of [[county court judgment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Third party debt orders - the informal freezing injunction?|url = http://www.franciswilksandjones.co.uk/site/fwjsays/businessmoney/third_party_debt_orders.html|date = January 2011|publisher = Francis Wilks &amp; Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extrajudicial application: "''Mareva'' by letter"==
Informal ''[[de facto]]'' freezing may also be undertaken in most common law jurisdictions by a third-party guardian or assetholder, where he has been informed that those assets are imposed with a constructive trust in favour of someone other than the apparent owner. The freeze may be effected by issuing a letter to the asset holder or guardian in question, informing them of the true origin or beneficial ownership of the targeted funds or assets, and advising them of their potential accessory civil and possible criminal liability in the event of any transfer or disposal of the assets in question.  Such devices may be employed in cases where a victim of fraud suspects that targeted funds or assets may be transferred to another location where it might be impractical to gain access to them. However, the use of this technique within the United States is not generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Martin S.

The '''Attorney General of the British Virgin Islands''' is the principal legal adviser to the [[Government of the British Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 58(2)&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the [[Constitution of the British Virgin Islands]] the Attorney General sits ''ex officio'' in both the [[House of Assembly of the British Virgin Islands]]&lt;ref&gt;Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, section 63(1)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Cabinet of the British Virgin Islands]],&lt;ref&gt;Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 47(1)&lt;/ref&gt; but is not permitted to vote in either.  The Attorney General also sits on the Committee for the Prerogative of Mercy&lt;ref&gt;Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 44(1)&lt;/ref&gt; and on the National Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 57(1)(d)&lt;/ref&gt;

The office traces its origins back to the reintroduction of democracy in the British Virgin Islands pursuant to the [[British Virgin Islands general election, 1950|1950 general election]].  At that time the Legislative Council (as the House of Assembly was then known) had to look to the [[Attorney General of the Leeward Islands]] for support.  This was regarded as unsatisfactory and following the [[British Virgin Islands general election, 1954|1954 general election]] Herman Besson was appointed to the title of Legal Assistant to the Legislative Council.  In 1959 the title of the office was changed to Crown Attorney, and subsequent to the introduction of Ministerial Government following the [[British Virgin Islands general election, 1967|1967 general election]] the office was titled Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |title=BVI election and information results 1950–2011 |publisher=BVI Deputy Governor's Office |pages=195–199 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407063531/http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Attorney General is supported by two senior law officers: the Solicitor General (in relation to civil matters) and the Director of Public Prosecutions (in relation to criminal matters).

When appearing in court, by convention the Attorney General sits one row in from the row reserved for [[Queen's Counsel]].

The current Attorney General is Baba Aziz.&lt;ref name=Aziz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bvinews.com/new/baba-aziz-appointed-attorney-general/|title=Baba Aziz appointed attorney general|publisher=BVI News|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr Aziz also formerly served as acting Attorney General for over a year between 24 June 2010 and 6 November 2011.

==Qualifications==
Since 2007 in order to be qualified to be appointed as Attorney General a person must be eligible to be admitted as a lawyer in the British Virgin Islands, and must have not less than 10 years experience practising law.&lt;ref&gt;Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 95(5)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this was not always the case, and various past Attorneys General were either not admitted in the British Virgin Islands and in some cases were not even eligible to be admitted in the British Virgin Islands.&lt;ref&gt;The longest ever serving Attorney General was [[Cherno Jallow]] QC, who was only admitted as a lawyer in Gambia, and was thereby ineligible for admission to practice as a lawyer in the British Virgin Islands.&lt;/ref&gt;

By law, since 2007 no person may be appointed to the office of Attorney General unless he or she is a [[Belonger status|Belonger]] to the Virgin Islands unless, in the opinion of the Judicial and Legal Services Commission, there is no such person who is suitably qualified and able and willing to be so appointed.&lt;ref&gt;Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 95(6)&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, every single Attorney General appointed since 2007 has been a non-Belonger, and only one Attorney General in the history of the British Virgin Islands was a belonger at the time they were appointed ([[Dancia Penn]]).&lt;ref&gt;Several Attorneys General settled in the British Virgin Islands and were naturalised after leaving office.&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of Attorneys General of the British Virgin Islands==
A total of 26 persons have been appointed to the office (including as Crown Attorney or Legal Assistant prior to 1967, and persons who were appointed as acting Attorney General), of whom 20 have been men and six have been women.  Three have been [[Queen's Counsel]] (although two were appointed to the rank during office), and the remaining 23 have been from the [[junior barrister|Outer bar]] or [[solicitor]]s during their time as Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;Two former Attorneys General were subsequently elevated to Queen's Counsel later in their careers: [[Joseph Archibald]], QC and Lewis Hunte, QC.&lt;/ref&gt;  The longest serving Attorney General to date has been [[Cherno Jallow]], who served just under eight years (including time as acting Attorney General).

'''Australian securities law''' relates to [[security (finance)|securities]] issued by [[corporation]]s as well as other securities, including [[debenture]]s, [[stock]]s and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] issued by [[government]]s, and interests in [[managed investment scheme]]s.

Australian securities regulation rests on the principle that "financial markets cannot function effectively unless participants act with integrity and there is adequate disclosure to facilitate informed judgements".&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth of Australia ''Financial System Inquiry Final Report'' (1997) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many of the regulatory rules governing dealings in securities are part of a broader framework that governs [[financial product]]s, [[financial services]] and [[financial markets]].

Mandatory disclosure and conduct regulation underlie much of Australia's securities regulation. [[False trading]], [[fraudulent dealing]], and [[insider trading]] are dealt with to prevent improper practices in connection with securities markets. A licensing system operates to ensure securities markets are fair, orderly and transparent. At the same time, securities law is also facilitative, allocating rights and duties in conjunction with general [[contract law]]. It also allows for a degree of [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]], by the operation for example of an independent [[securities exchange]].

Australian securities law has been substantially modernised in recent years. The core of these laws are found in the ''[[Corporations Act 2001|Corporations Act]]'' 2001 (Cth), which contains provisions governing [[takeover]]s, [[fundraising]], and financial products, services and markets.

== Legal and regulatory framework ==

The main body of [[substantive law]] about securities is found in the ''[[Corporations Act 2001|Corporations Act]]'' 2001 (Cth), as well as the regulations made under that Act. Whilst much of the law is derived from earlier regulation (especially the [[Boom and bust|bust]] in Australian mineral stocks of the late 1960s), the sections relating to securities regulation have been subject to recent amendment. The takeovers provisions were substantially re-written by the ''Corporation Law Economic Reform Program Act'' 1999. Changes to financial products, financial markets, and financial services were introduced by the ''Financial Services Reform Act'' 2001 (Cth), as a result of the ''Final Report of the Financial System Inquiry'', commonly referred to as "the Wallis report."&lt;ref name=Wallis1997&gt;{{cite book|last1=Financial System Inquiry|title=Final Report of the Financial System Inquiry|date=1997|location=Canberra, Australia|url=http://fsi.treasury.gov.au/content/FinalReport.asp|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of securities law are also found in the general law governing [[contract law|contracts]], [[trust law|trusts]], and [[torts]]. Securities regulation under the ''Corporations Act'' operates against the background of other Commonwealth legislation on [[Australian criminal law|criminal law]], [[Australian administrative law|administrative law]],&lt;ref&gt;''Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act'' 1977; ''Freedom of Information Act'' 1982; ''Privacy Act'' 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[statutory interpretation]].&lt;ref&gt;''Commonwealth Acts Interpretation Act'' 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;

Administration of the legislation is the responsibility of the [[Treasurer of Australia|Commonwealth Treasurer]] and the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] (ASIC), according to the ''[[Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act]]'' 2001 (Cth) and the ''Corporations Act'' 2001 (Cth). The market operator [[Australian Stock Exchange]] also has an important regulatory role to play.

The resolution of disputes is confided to the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] and the Supreme Courts of the States and the Northern Territory, with other courts having some powers to apply the securities legislation.

== Definitions ==

A security is "a thing in action", a claim enforceable by legal proceedings rather than owning some tangible property. To effect regulation the legislation adopts various definitions of "security" and "financial product" that are used.

There is also no law which stipulates that no person in which authority is not given (anyone other the law enforcement or owners of an establishment) may restrict persons entering and leaving a premises.

== Licensing ==

Only the holder of a market licence may operate a financial market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s791a.html ''Corporations Act'' 2001, s 791A].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial intermediaries ===

A person who carries on a financial services business in the jurisdiction must hold an Australian financial services licence.&lt;ref&gt;''Corporations Act'', s 911A(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market misconduct ==

Prevention of fraud and other forms of market misconduct has its foundation in the [[efficient-market hypothesis]].

General common law prohibitions against interfering with the free public market&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''R v de Berenger'' (1814) 3 Maule &amp; S 67; 105 ER 536. See also "Notaras &amp; Anor v Hugh &amp; Ors" [2003] NSWSC 167.&lt;/ref&gt; are strengthened by statutory prohibitions against various forms of market misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;''Corporations Act'' 2001 Part 7.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

One set of statutory prohibitions is upon trading activity which manipulates market prices.&lt;ref&gt;Corporations Act, s 1041A.&lt;/ref&gt; There are further prohibitions upon conduct that involves false trading or market rigging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s1041b.html] ''Corporations Act'' 2001, s 1041B.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1810">The '''Booksellers's Bill''' was a 1774 [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] introduced into the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] in the wake of the important [[copyright]] case of ''[[Donaldson v. Beckett]]''.

In ''Donaldson'' a perpetual [[common law copyright]] was denied to booksellers and it was held that copyright was a creation of [[statute]] and could be limited in its [[Copyright term|duration]]. As a result, booksellers sought to have the duration of their copyright extended to 14 years. Under [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom#Stages of a bill|UK parliamentary procedure]], the bill passed the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] but was defeated in the [[House of Lords]] and never became an [[act of parliament]].

'''Copyright Evidence''' is an English language wiki encyclopedia of empirical studies on copyright. It categorises legal studies on copyright so as to inform the public and policy development based on evidence. It was setup and run by CREATe at the [[University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref name="copy"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Copyright_Evidence |title=Copyright Evidence |website=www.copyrightevidence.org |language=en |access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Copyright Evidence was established in 2014 by Theo Koutmeridis, Kris Erickson, and Martin Kretschmer, as a project undertaken by the CREATe research centre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Copyright_Evidence|title=Copyright Evidence|website=www.copyrightevidence.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The project aims to be a consolidated and interdisciplinary “central source” for evidence-based copyright studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.create.ac.uk/blog/2018/03/09/research-blog-series-copyright-evidence-wiki/|title=Research Blog Series: The Copyright Evidence Wiki|date=2018-03-09|work=CREATe|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where users can examine findings and methodology transparently.

An editorial board was established in December 2017, which included the appointment of a sub-editor responsible for growing the existing base of studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/index.php/Copyright_Evidence|title=Copyright Evidence|website=www.copyrightevidence.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Methodology ==
Initial studies eligible for Copyright Evidence were identified using a snowball sampling methodology, beginning with a literature review by Watson, Zizzo and Fleming&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.create.ac.uk/publications/determinants-and-welfare-implications-of-unlawful-file-sharing-a-scoping-review/|title=Determinants and Welfare Implications of Unlawful File Sharing: A Scoping Review|date=2014-04-09|website=CREATe|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Thereafter: 103 working papers and pre-prints were identified through the SSRN e-journal Intellectual Property: Empirical Studies (published between November 1996 and July 2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/sample_issues/1649836_CMBO.html|title=Intellectual Property: Empirical Studies eJournal :: SSRN|website=papers.ssrn.com|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;; 81 studies via literature reviews by Handke&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/pgasite/documents/webpage/pga_063399.pdf|title=Economic Effects of Copyright: The Empirical Evidence So Far.

Ongoing growth of Copyright Evidence is achieved by search-based identifications. A literature review, conducted by the University of Illinois&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.create.ac.uk/blog/2018/03/09/research-blog-series-copyright-evidence-wiki/|title=Research Blog Series: The Copyright Evidence Wiki|date=2018-03-09|work=CREATe|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;, confirmed the veracity and comprehensiveness of Copyright Evidence in late-2018.

== Format ==
Copyright Evidence catalogues all “empirical studies on copyright in an attempt to inform policy interventions based on rigorous evidence”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyrightevidence.org/evidence-wiki/images/a/a4/WikiManual.pdf|title=A Guide to using the Copyright Evidence Wiki|last=CREATe|first=|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Permitted studies may also include multi-disciplinary elements, and do not need to be strictly legal in nature. Copyright Evidence is currently closed for unauthenticated user submissions, with relevant studies being identified and coded by a community of CREATe research assistants.

Each entry details the main findings of the relevant study, a description of the data involved, and relevant policy considerations. Studies are also categorised (amongst other factors) by country, JEL code, and research method. Iconographic indicators are used to identify the relevant industry, fundamental issues, and policy areas.

== Findings ==
Copyright Evidence currently holds details of over 600 evidence-based studies on copyright, and acts as a dynamic literature review platform which is open to text and data mining.

Mining and visualisation tools were explored during the 2016 EUHackathon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kl.nl/en/news/euhackathon-2016-visualising-copyright-evidence/|title=EUHackathon 2016: visualising copyright evidence {{!}} Kennisland|work=Kennisland|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://copyrightliteracy.org/2016/08/24/eu-hackathon-visualizing-copyright-evidence/|title=EU Hackathon: Visualizing Copyright Evidence|date=2016-08-24|work=UK Copyright Literacy|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://codeweek.eu/view/11774/2016-euhackahton-visualising-copyright-evidence|title=Europe Code Week|website=codeweek.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which identified certain clusters of cross-referencing between key related studies. Governmental reports, for example, tend to cross-reference other governmental reports, but less so academic evidence on copyright&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.create.ac.uk/blog/2018/03/09/research-blog-series-copyright-evidence-wiki/|title=Research Blog Series: The Copyright Evidence Wiki|date=2018-03-09|work=CREATe|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The former '''Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture''', established by resolution of the [[Congress of the Confederation]] on January 15, 1780,&lt;ref name="16 Journals 61-64"&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc01617)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Jan. 15, 1780, in 16 ''Journals'' 61-64.]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first [[United States federal court system|federal court]] in the [[United States of America]].

==Origin==
[[File:American_privateers_Edgar_S_Maclay.gif|thumb|During the [[American Revolution]], the [[United States]] issued [[letters of marque|letters of marque and reprisal]] authorizing private vessels, known as [[privateers]], to capture enemy ships and cargo as [[prize (law)|prizes]].]]

The idea for the Court originated from requests sent by [[General of the Armies|General]] [[George Washington]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] to [[President of the Continental Congress|President of Congress]] [[John Hancock]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/writingsgeorgew57washgoog#page/n237/mode/2up George Washington, Letter to the President of Congress dated Nov. 11, 1775, in 3 ''The Writings'' 213-14.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/writingsgeorgew57washgoog#page/n281/mode/2up George Washington, Letter to the President of Congress dated Dec. 4, 1775, in 3 ''The Writings'' 257-58.]&lt;/ref&gt; but initially resulted in only the establishment of committees within [[Second Continental Congress|Congress]] to exercise such [[jurisdiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00350)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Nov. 17, 1775, in 3 ''Journals'' 357-58.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00354)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Nov. 23, 1775, in 3 ''Journals'' 364-65.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00355)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Nov. 24, 1775, in 3 ''Journals'' 368-69.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="3 Journals 371-75"&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00356)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Nov. 25, 1775, in 3 ''Journals'' 371-75.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon learning of this deviation from his earlier requests, Washington sent another request to Hancock again asking that Congress establish the Court,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/writingsgeorgew57washgoog#page/n299/mode/2up George Washington, Letter to the President of Congress dated Dec. 14, 1775, in 3 ''The Writings'' 274.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00381)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Dec. 26, 1775, in 3 ''Journals'' 457.]&lt;/ref&gt; but Congress did not fulfill his request until almost four years later.&lt;ref name="16 Journals 61-64" /&gt;

==Authority for establishment==
Although specific express power to establish the Court was granted to [[Congress of the Confederation|Congress]] in the [[Articles of Confederation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=001/llsl001.db&amp;recNum=129 Articles of Confederation art. IX, § 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; the Articles of Confederation were not yet fully [[Ratification|ratified]] by all [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen of the original states]] when [[Second Continental Congress|Congress]] established the Court on January 15, 1780.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maryland]] did not [[ratification|ratify]] until February 2, 1781; see discussion of ratification by the states in [[Articles of Confederation]].&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that Congress nonetheless had inherent power at that time to establish the Court.&lt;ref&gt;[[Penhallow v. Doane's Administrators|''Penhallow v. Doane's Adm'rs'', 3 U.S. 54 passim (1795)]] (holding throughout a [[seriatim|seriatim opinion]] that [[Congress of the Confederation|Congress]] had inherent power to establish the Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture prior to [[ratification]] of the [[Articles of Confederation]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duration==
The Court operated from shortly after its founding in 1780&lt;ref&gt;[[Bancroft Davis|J.C. Bancroft Davis]], ''Federal Courts'', [http://google.com/books?id=FmYUAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 131 U.S.] app. at xxviii, xxix, and xxxv-xlix (see cases numbered 21, 38, 40, 45, 49, 50, 53, 56, 65 through 68, and 72 adjudicated or otherwise disposed of in 1780).&lt;/ref&gt; through its final cases in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bancroft Davis|J.C. Bancroft Davis]], ''Federal Courts'', [http://google.com/books?id=FmYUAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 131 U.S.] app. at xxviii, xxix, and xxxv-xlix (see cases numbered 87, 89, 103, and 109 adjudicated or otherwise disposed of in 1787).&lt;/ref&gt;  It officially ceased to exist following [[ratification]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]] in 1789&lt;ref&gt;See discussion of ratification by the states in [[United States Constitution]].&lt;/ref&gt; that transferred federal judicial power to the newly created [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] and such other inferior (i.e., lower) [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal courts]] as Congress may establish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=001/llsl001.db&amp;recNum=140 U.S. Const. art. III, § 1]; see also discussion of Section 1 in [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Penhallow v. Doane's Administrators|''Penhallow v. Doane's Adm'rs'', 3 U.S. 54 (1795)]], 86 (opinion of [[William Paterson (judge)|Paterson]], J.) ("The existence of the Court of Appeals [in Cases of Capture] terminated with the old government [of the United States of America] . . . .").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdiction==
Beginning with [[Massachusetts]] on November 1, 1775, several of the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] (and, later, states) established [[prize court]]s to exercise [[original jurisdiction]] over all cases (or [[Libel (admiralty law)|libels]]) of [[prize (law)|captures (or prizes)]] consisting of enemy ships and cargo.&lt;ref name="131 U.S"&gt;[[Bancroft Davis|J.C. Bancroft Davis]], ''Federal Courts'', in [http://google.com/books?id=FmYUAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 131 U.S.] app. at xx-xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Establishment of such courts was recommended by Congress on November 25. 1775.&lt;ref name="3 Journals 371-75" /&gt;

On November 25, 1775, [[Second Continental Congress|Congress]] also asserted federal [[Appellate court|appellate]] [[jurisdiction]] over such cases.&lt;ref name="3 Journals 371-75" /&gt;  Following repeated scheduling difficulties when Congress attempted to hear the first appeal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00551)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Aug. 5, 1776, in 5 ''Journals'' 631.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00557)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Aug. 12, 1776, in 5 ''Journals'' 647.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00568)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Aug. 26, 1776, in 5 ''Journals'' 702.]&lt;/ref&gt; Congress initially assigned this jurisdiction to various special committees,&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00580)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Sept. 9, 1776, in 5 ''Journals'' 747.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00597)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Sept. 30, 1776, in 5 ''Journals'' 835.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc0068)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Oct. 17, 1776, in 6 ''Journals'' 884-85.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00624)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Nov. 7, 1776, in 6 ''Journals'' 931-32.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00641)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Nov. 27, 1776, in 6 ''Journals'' 985-86.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00665)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Dec. 31, 1776, in 6 ''Journals'' 1060.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc0078)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Jan. 4, 1777, in 7 ''Journals'' 13.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00714)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Jan. 11, 1777, in 7 ''Journals'' 30.]&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a standing committee on Jan. 30, 1777.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00729)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Jan. 30, 1777, in 7 ''Journals'' 75.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bancroft Davis|J.C. Bancroft Davis]], ''Federal Courts'', in [http://google.com/books?id=FmYUAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 131 U.S.] app. at xxiii-xxv and xxxv-xlix (see cases numbered 1 through 64).&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, on January 15, 1780, Congress established the Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture to exercise this jurisdiction as a [[Supreme court|court of last resort]].&lt;ref name="16 Journals 61"&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc01617)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Jan. 15, 1780, in 16 ''Journals'' 61.]&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 24, 1780, Congress transferred all remaining appeals pending before committees to the Court and specified that all future appeals were to be filed directly with the Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc01715)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from May 24, 1780, in 17 ''Journals'' 457-59.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 1786, the Court's jurisdiction was again expanded to include [[New trial|rehearings and new trials]] in certain cases wherever justice so required.&lt;ref name="30 Journals 355-56"&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc030128)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from June 27, 1786, in 30 ''Journals'' 355-56.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Special jurisdiction was also conferred upon the Court on February 11, 1782 for a capture adjudicated by a prize court in [[Connecticut]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc02230)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Feb. 11, 1782, in 22 ''Journals'' 72.]&lt;/ref&gt; and on July 24, 1786 for a capture of the sloop Chester.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc030146)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from July 24, 1786, in 30 ''Journals'' 423-24.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Times and locations of sessions==
The first session of the Court was required to be held in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] at the earliest opportunity.&lt;ref name="16 Journals 61" /&gt;  Subsequent sessions were to be held at other times and locations in the United States as deemed conducive to the public good, but no farther east than [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and no farther south than [[Williamsburg, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="16 Journals 61" /&gt; [[Congress of the Confederation|Congress]] later specified the time and location for some sessions of the Court, including specific sessions to be held at Hartford, Connecticut; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; [[Richmond, Virginia]]; and [[New York City|New York, New York]].&lt;ref name="30 Journals 355-56" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc02469)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Jan. 29, 1783, in 24 ''Journals'' 98.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
The primary means of initiating an [[appeal]] to the Court required a party to first demand an appeal in the [[trial court]] within five days after definitive sentence and then file an appeal in and give adequate security to the Court within forty days after demanding an appeal in the trial court.&lt;ref name="17 Journals 459"&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc01715)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from May 24, 1780, in 17 ''Journals'' 459.]&lt;/ref&gt;  On Sept. 5, 1781, an extension of time for appeal was granted in the case of a capture decided in favor of Patrick Mahon against Roger Kean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc02136)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Sept. 5, 1781, in 21 ''Journals'' 935-36.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, some appeals filed with Congress and referred to committees were subsequently transferred to the Court.&lt;ref name="17 Journals 459" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bancroft Davis|J.C. Bancroft Davis]], ''Federal Courts'', in [http://google.com/books?id=FmYUAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 131 U.S.] app. at xxxiv-xlix (see cases numbered 3, 18, 21, 30, 38, 40, 45, 49, 50, 53, and 56).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jury trial|Trial by jury]] was considered inconsistent with the [[Public international law|usage of nations]], and, therefore, was not authorized in the Court.&lt;ref name="16 Journals 61" /&gt;  However, trial by jury was authorized in some of the state [[prize court]]s,&lt;ref name="131 U.S"/&gt; where Congress initially recommended it,&lt;ref name="3 Journals 371-75" /&gt; only to later recommend against it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc01617)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from Jan. 15, 1780, in 16 ''Journals'' 62.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case before the Court that involved a capture suspected of being collusive, the Court was required to demand sufficient proof to the contrary from the captor and, if the captor failed to meet this burden, the Court was required to award the prize to the state where the original trial was held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc022131)): Cont'l Cong., Journal and Records from July 17, 1782, in 22 ''Journals'' 392-93.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judges==
The Court was composed of three judges, but a [[quorum]] only required the presence of two judges.&lt;ref name="16 Journals 61" /&gt;

All judges serving on the Court were first required to take the following [[oath of office]] administered before the [[President of the Continental Congress|President of Congress]]:

==Career==
Hickton began his legal career as a law clerk for U.S. District Judge [[Gustave Diamond]] from 1981 to 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2009/10/27/Hickton-believed-to-be-frontrunner-for-U-S-attorney/stories/200910270268|title=Hickton believed to be frontrunner for U.S. attorney|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For eleven years, Hickton was an adjunct professor at the [[Duquesne University School of Law]], where he taught a course on [[competition law|antitrust law]]. He served on the Board of Trustees at [[Penn State University]] from 1977-1980.

He was nominated as [[United States Attorney]] for Western Pennsylvania by President [[Barack Obama]] on May 3, 2010, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 5, 2010.

In May, 2014, Hickton's office brought an indictment against five members of the [[Chinese People's Liberation Army]], alleging economic espionage. The defendants were charged with hacking into American entities to steal trade secrets and other information that would be useful to Chinese competitors. Victims included [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], the [[U.S. Steel]], [[Alcoa]], Inc., and [[Allegheny Technologies]].&lt;ref name="Allegheny Technologies" /&gt; His office also indicted Russian hacker [[Evgeniy Bogachev]], one of the world's leading cyber criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Pittsburgh Officials Indict International Cyber-Criminal"|url=http://wesa.fm/post/pittsburgh-officials-indict-international-cyber-criminal#stream/0|accessdate=24 April 2017|agency=WESA-FM|publisher=Liz Reid|date=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, his office, in cooperation with the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and legal authorities in 19 other countries, shut down [[Dark0de]], a [[Computer crime|cybercrime]] [[Crime forum|forum]] and [[black market]]place for [[security hacker]]s.

In 2011, Hickton assembled a Community Police Working Group to help build trust between members of law enforcement and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David J. Hickton|url=http://www.law.pitt.edu/people/david-j-hickton|website=PittLaw|publisher=University of Pittsburgh School of Law|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group held community-based meetings, developed a Crisis Team, and distributed thousands of surveys to elicit community feedback about community-police relations and safety. In 2015, Pittsburgh was selected by Attorney General [[Loretta Lynch]] as one of six pilot cities for the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Emma|title="U.S. Attorney General Addresses Pittsburgh's Community-Police Relationships"|url=http://wesa.fm/post/us-attorney-general-addresses-pittsburgh-s-community-police-relationships#stream/0|accessdate=26 April 2017|publisher=WESA-FM|date=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Li Wangyang''' ({{zh|李旺阳}}, 12 November 1950 – 6 June 2012) was a Chinese dissident [[labor rights]] activist, member of the [[Workers Autonomous Federation]] and chairman of the [[Shaoyang]] WAF branch. Following his role in the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], he served twenty-one years in prison on charges of counterrevolutionary propaganda, incitement, and subversion. Of all Chinese pro-democracy activists from 1989, Li has spent the longest time in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Kaiyee (7 June 2012). [http://chinadailymail.com/2012/06/07/bizarre-suicide-in-hunan-of-june-4-leader-is-suspected-murder/ "Bizarre 'suicide' in Hunan of June 4 leader is suspected murder"]. ''China Daily Mail''. Retrieved 10 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 June 2012, one year after his release from prison, and a few days after a television interview in which he continued to call for vindication of the Tiananmen Square protests, Li was found hanged in a hospital room. Shaoyang city authorities initially claimed suicide was the cause of death, but it was revised to 'accidental death' after the autopsy.

Following a protest march attended by up to 25,000 people, [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|Pan Democrats]] and senior establishment figures in Hong Kong publicly commented on the suspicious nature of the death, and said they had escalated the demands of citizens to politicians or "relevant departments" at national level for an independent investigation. The uproar in Hong Kong is said by commentators have put pressure on mainland authorities to order a criminal investigation so as not to overshadow the impending visit of president [[Hu Jintao]] for the 15th anniversary celebrations of the [[handover of Hong Kong]].

==Protests and imprisonment==
A worker in a glass factory, Li Wangyang set up a labour union under inspiration of the [[Democracy Wall]] in 1983. In 1989, China saw mass pro-democracy protests throughout the country, with the largest protests in [[Tiananmen Square]], Beijing. After hundreds died when the [[People's Liberation Army]] suppressed the protests on 4 June, Li pasted a poster on a Shaoyang traffic sign urging a general strike in support of the protests. Two days later, Li organized a memorial for the victims.&lt;ref name=20120606LAT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/06/china-activist-found-hanged-in-hospital-room.html |title= Tiananmen activist found hanged in Chinese hospital room |author=Barbara Demick |date=6 June 2012 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his actions, Li was jailed on 9 June for "counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/06/06/uk-china-dissident-idUKBRE85512E20120606 Chinese dissident found dead, family suspect foul play]. Reuters, 6 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, but his sentence was increased to thirteen years when he appealed to the court. He was also sentenced to [[hard labour]]. As his health deteriorated, he was granted medical parole in June 1996, but the authorities cancelled his release after [[Deng Xiaoping]] died in 1997, fearing calls for the other responsible officials to be held accounted for the 4 June Massacre. In June 2000 Li was released again for reasons of poor health.&lt;ref name=G76&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/06/china-dissident-li-wangyang-dead |title=China dissident Li Wangyang found dead in hospital |date=7 June 2012 |work=The Guardian     |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights in China (organization)|Human Rights in China]] (HRIC) alleged that Li was tortured while in custody, resulting in his losing both his sight and hearing.&lt;ref name=Reut76&gt;{{cite news |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/06/07/china-dissident-li-wangyang-idINDEE85606A20120607 |title=Online petitioners seek probe into China dissident death |author=James Pomfret and Stefanie McIntyre |date=7 June 2012 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Li himself said in his last interview that the only explanation for his becoming blind was through nerve damage caused by being repeatedly beaten about the head.

During his spells in prison, Li was a frequent inmate in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=nyt20120608jacobs&gt;Jacobs, Andrew (8 June 2012). [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/09/world/asia/chinese-activist-li-wangyang-death-called-suicide-but-supporters-are-suspicious.html "Chinese Activist’s Death Called Suicide, but Supporters Are Suspicious"]. ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Li began a [[hunger strike]] as part of a petition to authorities to repay his health care costs, and was given an additional ten-year sentence for "inciting subversion".&lt;ref name=AI/&gt; Whilst attempting to force feed Li during his hunger strike, guards knocked out Li's front teeth. He finally gained freedom in May 2011, when he checked into Daxiang District Hospital to treat his medical conditions.&lt;ref name=nyt20120608jacobs/&gt; His sister, who lived 7&amp;nbsp;km away from the hospital, visited him twice a day with his meals&lt;ref name="力抗中共　旺陽妹決不火化哥哥"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20120608/16408519| title=力抗中共　旺陽妹決不火化哥哥 |work=Apple Daily | date=8 June 2012 | accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Li remained vocal in demanding vindication of the Tiananmen protesters up until his death: in an interview with [[i-CABLE News Channel (Hong Kong)|i-CABLE]] broadcast four days before, he said "the souls of the martyrs deserve to finally find some peace".&lt;ref name=Reut76/&gt; He advocated a multi-party democracy for his country, and said he did not regret his fight for a better China, "even had [he] been beheaded"&lt;ref name=guard20120608tania/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He said: "Under the principle of 'one country, two systems', the most important responsibility for a chief executive is to safeguard the freedoms of speech and expression of Hong Kong people"; Chief executive-elect CY Leung said he shared the feelings of fellow citizens about the issue.&lt;ref name=scmp20120615stuart/&gt; On 16 June, Chief Executive-elect, C.Y. Leung, observed a minute's silence in honour of Li at a function, but maintained that it would be "inappropriate" for him to comment on the death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rthk.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/20120616/news_20120616_56_848304.htm "CY takes part in tribute to Li Wangyang "].

=== Macao ===
Pro-democracy Macanese legislators [[Chan Wai Chi]], [[Au Kam San]] and [[Ng Kuok Cheong]] wrote to PRC Premier Wen Jiabao and other deputies to the Chinese People’s National Congress demanding an investigation of Li's mysterious "suicide". They protested the Shaoyang public security office ignoring escalating calls for a transparent investigation Li's death, and accused them of "destroying the evidence" by cremating Li’s body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau/36500-lawmakers-write-pm-to-probe-dubious-death-of-mainland-activist.html "Lawmakers write PM to probe dubious death of Mainland activist"]. ''Macau Times'' 12 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hunan investigation ==
Following the public outcry, Li Gang, deputy director of the Hong Kong–central government liaison office in said that Hunan Public Security Bureau ordered a criminal investigation into the death.&lt;ref name=hks20120615phila/&gt; Li said: "We have noted the concern expressed by the Hong Kong community and media on [Li Wangyang's death]. We have reflected their concerns to the relevant departments in the central government."&lt;ref name=scmp20120615stuart&gt;Lau, Stuart; Tam, Johnny; Mok, Danny; So, Peter (15 June 2012). "Beijing loyalists welcome probe of activist's death". ''South China Morning Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''South China Morning Post'' noted that announcement about the forensic and criminal investigation by experts from outside Hunan province came through the semi-official Hong Kong China News Agency rather than [[Xinhua]], saying it indicated that the announcement was targeted at Hong Kong, designed to calm public anger.&lt;ref name=scmp20120616staff&gt;Staff Reporters (16 June 2012). "Fresh probe takes heat off Hu's visit". ''South China Morning Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; Pundits say the uproar in Hong Kong has put pressure on mainland authorities to order a criminal investigation so as not to threaten the legacy of outgoing president [[Hu Jintao]] and overshadow his impending visit for the 15th anniversary celebrations of the [[handover of Hong Kong]]. Political commentator Johnny Lau said that if Hu had not been planning on coming to Hong Kong, "the case could drag on or may be forgotten".&lt;ref name=scmp20120616staff/&gt;

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}
In U.S. [[legal procedure]], each party to a [[lawsuit]] has the duty to disclose certain information, such as the names and addresses of [[witness]]es, and copies of any documents that it intends to use as evidence, to the opposing party.  This duty is subject to certain exceptions, as outlined in the ''[[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]]''; furthermore, the rules applicable in [[State court (United States)|state courts]] vary from state to state.

In [[United States patent law]], during [[patent prosecution]], an applicant has a duty to disclose all information [[materiality (law)|material]] to [[patentability]]. Breach of this duty can lead to a holding of [[inequitable conduct]], in which case the patent is unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e319407 37 C.F.R. § 1.56]&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent [[electoral commission]] is planned by [[Government of the 32nd Dáil|the current Irish government]] to oversee the conduct of [[elections in the Republic of Ireland|all elections in the state]]. This responsibility is at present distributed among various [[Department of State (Ireland)|government departments]], statutory agencies and components of the [[Oireachtas]] (parliament).

==History==
An electoral commission was recommended by several official reports, including the Second Report (2006) of the [[Electronic voting in Ireland|Commission on Electronic Voting]].&lt;ref name="evoting2p206"&gt;{{cite book|author=Commission on Electronic Voting|title=Second Report; on the Secrecy, Accuracy and Testing of the Chosen Electronic Voting System|url=http://opac.oireachtas.ie/Data/Library3/Library2/DL001570.pdf#page=208 |format=PDF|date=July 2006|publisher=Stationery Office|location=Dublin|page=206, R.41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Private member's bill]]s to establish an electoral commission were introduced by [[Ciarán Lynch]] in 2008 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the then [[Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government]] commissioned and published a study on introducing an electoral commission, carried out by academics from [[University College Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/Voting/PublicationsDocuments/FileDownLoad,19472,en.pdf |title=Preliminary study on the establishment of an Electoral Commission in Ireland |last=Sinnott |first=Richard |author2=John Coakley |author3=John O’Dowd |author4=James McBride |date=November 2008 |publisher=[[Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government]] |accessdate=28 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125051127/http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/Voting/PublicationsDocuments/FileDownLoad,19472,en.pdf |archivedate=25 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 general election]], the  [[Fine Gael]] and [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] parties formed  [[Government of the 31st Dáil|a coalition government]]  whose programme included a commitment to establish an electoral commission.&lt;ref&gt;DECLG 2015, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Such a commission was also recommended in the [[Constitutional Convention (Ireland)|Constitutional Convention]]'s 2013 report on the system of elections to [[Dáil Éireann]] (lower house of the Oireachtas),&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Convention 2013, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; which was also endorsed the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014121800047#N4|title=Fourth Report of the Constitutional Convention on the Dáil Electoral System: Statements (Continued)|date=18 December 2014|work=Dáil Éireann debates|page=47|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Kelly (politician)|Alan Kelly]], the [[Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government]],  outlined progress of the plan in [[Seanad Éireann]] (upper house of the Oireachtas) in December 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merrionstreet.ie/en/News-Room/Speeches/%E2%80%9CProgress_on_the_Establishment_of_Independent_Electoral_Commission%E2%80%9D_Speech_by_the_Minister_for_the_Environment_Community_and_Local_Government_Alan_Kelly_T_D_.html|title="Progress on the Establishment of Independent Electoral Commission" Speech by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Alan Kelly T.D.|date=17 December 2014|work=MerrionStreet.ie|publisher=[[Government of Ireland]]|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014121700024#BB00300 |title=Electoral Commission: Motion |date=17 December 2014 |work=Seanad Éireann debates |page=24 |accessdate=28 April 2015 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government published a consultation paper in January 2015, and said it intended to introduce a [[bill (law)|bill]] in the Oireachtas in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Taoiseach_and_Government/Government_Legislation_Programme/Government_Legislative_Programme_Spring_Summer_2015.pdf#page=13 |format=PDF |title=Section C: Bills in respect of which heads have yet to be approved by Government|last=Kehoe|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Kehoe|date=14 January 2015|work=Government Legislation Programme: Spring/Summer Session 2015 |page=13 |accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht discussed the plan with Alan Kelly on 10 March 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3225">{{Distinguish|Renewable Energy Certificate (United States)|Green (certification)}}{{Globalize/Europe|date=December 2010}}

A '''green certificate''' – terminology predominantly used in Europe but now becoming more widespread globally – are a tradable commodity proving that certain electricity is generated using renewable energy sources. Typically one certificate represents the generation of one Megawatthour of electricity. What is defined as "renewable" varies from certificate trading scheme to trading scheme. Usually, at least the following sources are considered as renewable:

* [[Wind power|Wind]] (often further divided into onshore and offshore)
* [[Solar power|Solar]] (often further divided into photovoltaic and thermal)
* Wave (often further divided into onshore and offshore) and [[tidal]] (often further divided into onshore and offshore)
* [[Geothermal]]
* Hydro (often further divided into small – [[microhydro]] – and large)
* [[Biomass]] (mainly [[biofuel]]s, often further divided by actual fuel used).

Green certificates represent the environmental value of renewable energy generated. The certificates can be traded separately from the energy produced. Several countries use green certificates as a mean to make the support of green electricity generation closer to a market economy instead of more bureaucratic investment support and feed-in tariffs. Such national trading schemes are in use in e.g. Poland, Sweden, the UK, Italy, Belgium (Wallonia and Flanders), and some US states.

Once in the grid, renewable energy is impossible to separate from the conventionally generated energy. This makes purchasing of a green certificate equal to purchasing a claim, that the certificate owner consumed energy from the renewable portion of the whole energy in the grid. Therefore certificate purchase does not affect how much renewable energy was actually generated – only how it was distributed.

In contrast to [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e]]-Reduction certificates, e.g. [[Assigned amount units|AAU]]'s or [[Certified Emission Reduction|CER]]'s under the [[UNFCC]], which can be exchanged worldwide, Green Certificates cannot be exchanged/traded between e.g. Belgium and Italy, let alone the USA and the EU member States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28804">'''Horse slaughter''' is the practice of [[Slaughter (livestock)|slaughtering]] [[horse]]s to produce [[horse meat|meat]] for consumption. Humans have long consumed horse meat; the oldest known cave art, the 30,000-year-old paintings in France's [[Chauvet Cave]], depict horses with other wild animals hunted by humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/chav/hd_chav.htm Chauvet Cave (ca. 30,000 B.C.)", Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, retrieved May 9, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Domestication of the horse|Equine domestication]] is believed to have begun to raise horses for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fubini.swarthmore.edu/~ENVS2/S2007/llam1/horses1.html Early Domestication of Horse], Lilian Lam, Swarthmore College Environmental Studies, retrieved May 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 21. Élise Rousseau. 2017. ''Horses of the World.'' Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice has become controversial in some parts of the world due to several concerns: whether horses are (or can be) managed humanely in industrial slaughter; whether horses not raised for consumption yield safe meat, and whether it is appropriate to consume a companion animal.

== {{anchor|Slaughtering}}Methods ==
In most countries where horses are slaughtered for food, they are processed in industrial [[abattoir]]s similarly to cattle. Typically, a penetrating [[captive bolt gun]] or gunshot is used to render the animal unconscious. The blow (or shot) is intended to kill the horse instantly or stun it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusfd7usca1901.htm United States Humane Slaughter Act], § 1902 Humane Methods, retrieved May 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; with [[exsanguination]] (bleeding out) conducted immediately afterwards to ensure death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/260514/20111202/horse-meat-slaughter-approved-5-reasons-eat.htm "Horse Slaughter Approved in U.S.: 5 Reasons Not to Eat Horse Meat", International Business Times, retrieved May 10, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Saleable meat is removed from the carcass, with the remains [[Rendering (food processing)|rendered]] for other commercial uses.

According to equine-welfare advocates, the physiology of the equine cranium is such that neither the penetrating captive bolt gun nor gunshots are reliable means of killing (or stunning) a horse; the animal may be only paralyzed. Unless properly checked for vital signs, a horse may remain conscious and experience pain during skinning and butchering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manesandtailsorganization.org/captive_bolt.htm Use of the 'Penetrating Captive Bolt' As A Means Of Rendering Equines Insensible For Slaughter Violates The Humane Slaughter Act Of 1958], Manes and Tails Organization, retrieved May 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horsefund.org/horse-slaughter-images.php Horse Slaughter Images and Description], Intl' Fund for Horses, retrieved May 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/action/action-alerts/Canadians--Act-Now-to-Ban-Horse-Slaughter-.aspx Canadians: Act Now to Ban Horse Slaughter!], People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, retrieved May 10, 2012,&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Horse meat was a traditional protein source during food shortages, such as the early-20th-century World Wars. Before the advent of motorized warfare, campaigns usually resulted in tens of thousands of equine deaths; troops and civilians ate the carcasses, since troop logistics were often unreliable. Troops of [[Napoleon]]'s [[Grande Armée]] killed almost all of their horses during their retreat from Moscow to feed themselves. In his biography, ''Fifty Years a Veterinary Surgeon'', Fredrick Hobday wrote that when his British Army veterinary field hospital arrived in [[Cremona]] from France in 1916 it was the subject of a bidding war (won by [[Milan]]ese horse-meat canners) for salvageable equine carcasses.

During World War II, the less-motorized [[Axis powers|Axis]] troops lost thousands of horses in combat and during the unusually-cold [[Russian winter]]s. Malnourished soldiers consumed the animals, often shooting weaker horses as needed. In his 1840s book, ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'', [[Henry Mayhew]] wrote that horse meat was priced differently in Paris and London.&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, Henry, ''London Labour and the London Poor:'' Volume II, Dover Publications (1968), Paperback {{ISBN|0-486-21935-6}}, page 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In some countries, horses are perceived as [[gods]] or as deserving of humane consideration because of their roles as working animals and for sport. This perception may be greater in countries where horses are not bred or raised for food. According to a 2012 UK [[Ipsos MORI|MORI]] survey, 50 percent of respondents in France as well as 51 percent in Belgium and 58 percent in Italy thought it acceptable to eat horses.&lt;ref name="HSI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsi.org/world/europe/work/horse_slaughter/factsheets/horse_slaughter_europe.html|accessdate=September 19, 2016|title=Horse slaughter and the horse-meat trade in Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several equine and animal-welfare organizations oppose slaughter or support a ban on horse slaughter,&lt;ref name="VFEW"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Veterinarians for Equine Welfare|url=http://www.vetsforequinewelfare.org/white_paper.php|year=2011|accessdate=September 20, 2016|title=Horse slaughter–its ethical impact and subsequent response of the veterinary profession}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HS Horse slaughter"&gt;{{cite web|title=The facts about horse slaughter|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/horse_slaughter/facts/facts_horse_slaughter.html|accessdate=September 20, 2016|publisher=The Humane Society of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AWI Horse slaughter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awionline.org/content/horse-slaughter|title=Horse slaughter|accessdate=September 20, 2016|publisher=Animal Welfare Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other animal organizations and animal-agriculture groups support the practice. According to livestock-slaughter expert [[Temple Grandin]], horse slaughter can be humane with proper facility design and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grandin|first1=Temple|title=Answering Questions about Animal Welfare during Horse Slaughter|url=http://www.grandin.com/humane/questions.answers.horse.slaughter.html|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included in animal-agriculture groups supporting horse slaughter are organizations representing the interests of traditional food-animal industries such as cattle, sheep and pigs, who are concerned that banning any animal for slaughter will lead to outlawing all meat production.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Stolen horses have been sold to auctions, where they are bought by "kill buyers" and shipped to slaughter. Auctions enable horses to be sold without owner consent, by theft&lt;ref name="rhapsody"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://cjonline.com/news/2011-10-15/rhapsody-vanishes-ether-slaughter-market|title=Rhapsody vanishes into ether of slaughter market|publisher=The Topeka Capital-Journal|date=October 15, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; or misappropriation.&lt;ref name="salters"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://bigbendnow.com/2011/09/horse-%E2%80%98kill-buyer%E2%80%99-arrested-in-marfa-now-wanted-for-additional-livestock-theft/|title=Kill buyer once arrested in Marfa, now on the run from more charges|publisher=The Big Bend Sentinel|date=September 15, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to California Livestock and Identification Bureau statistics, the 1998 ban on horse slaughter in California was followed by a 34-percent decrease in horse theft.&lt;ref name="hsus-horse-facts"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/horse_slaughter/facts/facts_horse_slaughter.html|title=The Facts on Horse Slaughter|publisher=The Humane Society of the United States|date=January 25, 2010|accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="awi-horse-facts"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.awionline.org/content/horse-slaughter-facts-faqs|title=Horse Slaughter Facts and FAQs|publisher=Animal Welfare Institute|accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-distance transport===
One concern about the welfare of horses destined for slaughter is the long distances the horses are sometimes transported to a slaughterhouse. In 2013, 32,841 horses were slaughtered in Italy; of these, 32,316 were transported from other EU states.&lt;ref name="HSI2014"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Humane Society International|title=Facts and figures on the EU horsemeat trade|url=http://www.hsi.org/search-results.html?q=facts+and+figures+horse|year=2014|accessdate=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==

=== Food safety ===
Horses in the United States are not bred or raised for meat. Nearly all equine medications and treatments are labeled, "Not for horses intended for human consumption." Meat from American horses raises a number of potential health concerns, primarily due to the routine use of medications banned in food animals and a lack of tracking of such use. Unlike livestock raised for food (where all potential medications are tested for withdrawal times and vigilantly tracked), there is no way to guarantee which medications have been used in a particular horse. During November and December 2010 inspections of EU-regulated plants in Mexico which slaughtered horses for human consumption, the European Commission Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) uncovered violations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120405004350/http://horsebackmagazine.com/hb/archives/8591 Horsebackmagazine.com] "In a report filed by the FVO (Food and Veterinary Office), a number of serious violations and actions taken were cited, including these noted by Animals’ Angels. Two out of five establishments failed to meet EU requirements relating to slaughter hygiene and water quality. Additionally, there were non-traceable carcasses, a number of which were in contact with EU eligible horse meat. No export certificates will be issued until these issues are satisfactorily resolved. Random samples were taken from horse meat processed in 2008, 2009 and 2010 tested positive for EU prohibited drug residues. Sworn statements made by horse owners on veterinary medical treatment histories were not authenticated and proven false, including cases of positive results for EU prohibited drug residues. From January and October 2010, of the 62,560 US horses shipped to slaughter 5,336 were rejected at the border due to advanced pregnancy, health problems or injuries. In a visit to one US export pen, 12 of the 30 horses held there were rejected."&lt;/ref&gt; Most American horses destined for slaughter are transported to EU-regulated plants in Mexico and Canada. Horses, unlike traditional food animals in the United States, are not raised (or medicated) with the intent of becoming human food. Because American horses are not intended for the human food chain, they often receive medications banned by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] for use in food animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vetsforequinewelfare.org/prohibited-drugs.php Drugs prohibited for use in horses intended for human consumption][http://www.vetsforequinewelfare.org Veterinarians for Equine Welfare]&lt;/ref&gt; Concern also exists that horse meat will be mixed with ground-beef products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strom|first=Stephanie|title=U.S.D.A May Approve Horse Slaughtering|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/business/usda-may-approve-horse-slaughter-plant.html?_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold improperly labeled in the US, as occurred during the European [[2013 horse meat scandal]].

Before 2007, three major equine [[slaughterhouse]]s operated in the United States: Dallas Crown in [[Kaufman, Texas]]; Beltex Corporation in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], and Cavel International in [[DeKalb, Illinois]]. All were Belgian-owned, with Multimeat also having French and Dutch ownership; Velda owned Cavel, Multimeat owned Beltex and Chevideco owned Dallas Crown. The slaughterhouses exported about $42&amp;nbsp;million in horse meat annually, with most going overseas. About 10 percent of their output was sold to zoos to feed their carnivores, and 90 percent was shipped to Europe and Asia for human consumption. Although the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] voted overwhelmingly to end horse slaughter in 2006, the bill never came to a vote before the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The two [[Texas]] horse-slaughter plants in were ordered closed in 2007, after protracted battles with local municipalities who objected to their financial drain on the municipalities (no tax revenue), ditches of blood, dismembered foals and noxious odors in residential neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nashvillescene.com/pitw/archives/2010/04/09/former-mayor-horse-slaughterhouses-a-drain-on-taxpayers-never-mind-the-ditches-of-blood Former Mayor: Horse Slaughterhouses a Drain on Taxpayers — Never Mind the Ditches of Blood | Pith in the Wind]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the Cavel plant was closed after local community action.&lt;ref name=huffington&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20070629/horse-slaughter/|title=Last US Horse Slaughterhouse to Close|author=Tara Burghart|date=June 29, 2007|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2007-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The director of equine protection of [[the Humane Society of the United States]] reported seizing large numbers of horses, and equine-rescue facilities were taking in more horses than ever despite a record number of horses shipped to Canada and Mexico for slaughter.&lt;ref name="suntimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/commentary/letters/364678,CST-EDT-VOX01a.article |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |title=Don't ban horse slaughter in Illinois |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008151030/http://www.suntimes.com/news/commentary/letters/364678%2CCST-EDT-VOX01a.article |archivedate=2007-10-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amy Hamilton, [http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/article_97d6bcfc-2298-561e-963c-9b87c2817687.html Horse abandonment rises], January 24, 2010, trib.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.com/articles/horse-93019-abandonment-junction.html Cases of horse neglect, abandonment growing in Colorado], January 24, 2010, Colorado Springs Gazette&lt;/ref&gt; The equine market was saturated by increased breeding.&lt;ref name=consequences&gt;[http://www.animalwelfarecouncil.com/html/pdf/consequences.pdf The unintended consequences of a ban on the humane slaughter (processing) of horses in the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707143541/http://www.animalwelfarecouncil.com/html/pdf/consequences.pdf |date=2011-07-07 }}, Animal Welfare Council, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Wyoming state Representative Sue Wallis proposed a new horse-meat processing plant in Missouri or Arkansas. According to Wallis, she had six million dollars to invest and support from Belgian horse-meat buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://horsebackmagazine.com/hb/archives/14512|title=Horse slaughter promoter alleges death threats to YMCA director|date=March 10, 2012|journal=Horseback Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May Wallis sought local investors in Wyoming to help finance the plant, which she said could cost between two and six million dollars and would process up to 200 horses a day for sale abroad and to ethnic markets in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/horse-slaughterhouse-planned-for-wyoming/article_f7ee4c06-a449-11e1-9a35-001a4bcf887a.html|title=Horse slaughterhouse planned for Wyoming|date=May 22, 2012|publisher=Star-Tribune|author=Pelzer, J.|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] Administration proposed the removal of funding for [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] inspection of horse-slaughter plants in the 2014 fiscal year, which would prevent horse slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://horsetalk.co.nz/2013/04/11/white-house-proposes-move-block-horse-slaughter/#.UW_j8KL-Elc|title=White House proposes move to block horse slaughter|date=April 11, 2013|publisher=Horsetalk.co.nz|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal proceedings===

Efforts have been made to create a federal law ending the slaughter of American horses for human consumption.&lt;ref name="saponline"&gt;[http://awionline.org/content/american-horse-slaughter-prevention-act Animal Welfare Institute: American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act]&lt;/ref&gt; On September 8, 2006, the House of Representatives passed a bill which would have made killing or selling American horses for human consumption illegal in the United States; however, it was not passed by the Senate.&lt;ref name="qjnet"&gt;[http://science.qj.net/New-US-Bill-Makes-Killing-Horses-for-Meat-Illegal-in-US/pg/49/aid/65094 Science.qj.net: New US Bill Makes Killing Horses for Meat Illegal in US]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two bills, H.R. 503 in the House and S. 1915 in the Senate, were introduced in the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]] to prevent the slaughter of horses for human consumption. H.R. 503 was passed by the House on September 7, 2006, by a recorded vote of 263&amp;ndash;146.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:HR00503:@@@S Bill Summary &amp; Status : 109th Congress (2005–2006) : H.R.503 : All Congressional Actions with Amendments].&lt;/ref&gt; S. 1915 was read twice, referred to committee and not voted on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:SN01915:@@@X Bill Summary &amp; Status : 109th Congress (2005–2006) : S.1915 : All Congressional Actions].&lt;/ref&gt; Both bills died at the end of the 109th Congress, and were reintroduced in the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]] on January 17, 2007 as H.R. 503 and S. 311.&lt;ref&gt;H.R.503 was referred to committee and not reported out for a vote.[http://thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR00503:@@@X Bill Summary &amp; Status : 110th Congress (2007–2008) : H.R.503 : All Congressional Actions].&lt;/ref&gt; S. 311 was reported out but not taken up for a vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:SN00311:@@@X Bill Summary &amp; Status : 110th Congress (2007–2008) : S.311 : All Congressional Actions].&lt;/ref&gt; The bills were not reintroduced in the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]]. Two bills were introduced in the 112th Congress: H.R. 2966 and S. 1176, the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act of 2011. The latter was introduced on July 9, 2011 by Senators Mary Landrieu (D-LA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to amend the [[Horse Protection Act of 1970]] ({{usctc|15|44}}) to prohibit the shipping, transporting, moving, delivering, receiving, possessing, purchasing, selling, or donation of horses and other equines to be slaughtered for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112s1176is/pdf/BILLS-112s1176is.pdf S.1176], June 9, 2011, Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Transportation of horses for slaughter}}Transport of horses for slaughter====
Although the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] has officers at enforcement points to ensure the proper transportation of horses, it has no jurisdiction beyond transportation. Horses that "are severely lame or disabled are not accepted at the plants".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

A 1998 USDA [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] survey to determine welfare problems during equine transport to slaughter found severe problems in 7.7 percent of the transported horses; most arose from owner neglect or abuse, rather than transportation. The report recommended fining individuals who transport horses unfit for travel.&lt;ref name="Grandin"&gt;Dr. Temple Grandin: [http://www.grandin.com/references/horse.transport.html Survey of Trucking Practices and Injury to Slaughter Horses].&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite those recommendations, in an April 2011 report on equine transport violations, of 458 violators and 280 cases reported since February 1, 2002, 51 violators were fined a total of $781,350.

US Department of Agriculture regulations govern the transportation of horses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfr.vlex.com/vid/88-3-standards-for-conveyances-19609827 9 CFR 88.3 - Standards for conveyances], [http://vlex.com/ vlex.com].&lt;/ref&gt; but the USDA has said that it does not have the resources for enforcement.&lt;ref name=hr305a&gt;[http://www.animallawcoalition.com/horse-slaughter/article/652 H.R. 305 Passes House Committee], [http://www.animallawcoalition.com/ animallawcoalition.com].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a bill which would have prohibited the interstate transport of live horses in double-deck [[horse trailer]]s passed out of committee in the House of Representatives and was placed on the [[Union Calendar]].&lt;ref name=hr305a /&gt; The bill died at the end of the 111th Congress.

On November 18, 2011, the ban on the slaughter of horses for meat was lifted as part of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Horse: Coming soon to a meat case near you? | url = http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2011/11/30/horse-coming-soon-to-a-meat-case-near-you/ | accessdate = 2011-12-01 | publisher = [[CNN]] | date = November 30, 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111202170850/http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2011/11/30/horse-coming-soon-to-a-meat-case-near-you/ | archivedate = December 2, 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was reestablished by Congress on January 14, 2014 with the passage of the Fiscal Year 2014 Omnibus Appropriations Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Congress Reinstates Annual Ban on Horse Slaughter | url = http://www.awionline.org/content/congress-reinstates-annual-ban-horse-slaughter | accessdate = 2014-03-14 | publisher = [[Animal Welfare Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2013 Senators Landrieu and Graham introduced S. 541, the Safeguard American Food Exports (SAFE) Act of 2013. The SAFE Act amends the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] to deem equine (horses and other members of the family Equidae) parts an unsafe food additive or animal drug. The SAFE Act also prohibits the knowing sale or transport of equines (or equine parts) in interstate or foreign commerce for human consumption. An identical version of the bill, H.R. 1094, was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives Patrick Meehan (R-PA) and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = National Animal Welfare Groups, Veterinarians and Horse Owners Applaud Federal Efforts to Protect Horses and the Public | URL = https://awionline.org/content/animal-welfare-groups-applaud-federal-efforts-protect-horses | accessdate = 2014-03-14 | publisher = [[Animal Welfare Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Judicial rulings ====
On January 19, 2007, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[New Orleans]] overturned a lower court's 2006 ruling that a 1949 Texas law banning horse slaughter for the purpose of selling the meat for food was invalid because it had been repealed by another statute and was preempted by federal law. A [[Judicial panel|panel]] of three 5th Circuit judges disagreed, saying that the Texas law still stood and was enforceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

"End long distance live transport!" www.rspca.org.uk/getinvolved/campaigns/farm/livetransport&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European [[2013 horse meat scandal]], foods advertised as containing beef were found to contain undeclared or improperly declared horse meat—100 percent of the meat content, in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21375594&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller number of products also contained other undeclared meats, such as pork.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/16/tesco-burgers-off-shelves-horsemeat&lt;/ref&gt; The issue came to light on January 15, 2013, when it was reported that equine DNA had been discovered in frozen beefburgers sold at several Irish and British supermarkets.

== France and Belgium ==
According to the 2007 ''Daily Mail'' article, 100,000 horses were transported annually into and around the [[European Union]] for human consumption in France and Belgium.&lt;ref name=DM20070519 /&gt; In 2011, Belgian and Dutch consumers learned about equine-slaughter-related cruelty in North and South America. Undercover video footage broadcast on three news programs showed that horses designated for slaughter are starved, dehydrated and injured. Within hours of the programs, supermarkets responded with promises to investigate. [[Delhaize Group|Delhaize]], Belgium's second-largest food retailer, asked its supplier to remove the affected meat from its shelves. Two other major grocers told consumers that they do not import horse meat from outside Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arizona1-aahsbloggingupdates.blogspot.com/2011/09/blow-to-european-horse-meat-market.html?m=0 Blow to European Horse Meat market expected to hit the US]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013''' ({{USBill|113|H.R.|267}}) is a [[Bill (law)|bill]] that was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] of the [[113th United States Congress]] on January 15, 2013.  It passed the House on February 13, 2013 by a vote of 422-0.&lt;ref&gt;{{US House Vote|2013|40}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama signed the Act into law on August 9, 2013.

The Bill is intended to change some of the regulations in the United States surrounding [[hydropower]] by making it easier to develop smaller-output hydropower stations.  According to the bill's proponents, current regulations are unwieldy and represent a significant hurdle to creating more hydropower plants.  The Bill would alter those regulations to make it easier for smaller plants to get approval quickly.  The legislation also requires the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)]] to study how to further improve the regulatory process.  The Bill would amend the [[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act|Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA)]] and the [[Federal Power Act]].  Currently, hydropower projects that produce 5,000 kilowatts or less of power do not require certain licenses.&lt;ref name=hillFeb13&gt;{{cite news|last=Colman|first=Zack|title=Hydropower bill sails through House|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/282937-hydropower-bill-sails-through-house-|accessdate=April 4, 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill would raise that amount to 10,000 kilowatts, facilitating the speed at which smaller hydropower projects could be built.  The existing rules mean that it takes about five years for hydropower projects to get approval, according to hydropower industry sources.&lt;ref name="hillFeb13" /&gt;

Hydropower is a significant source of [[renewable energy]] in the United States.  The [[National Hydropower Association]] (NHA) conducted a study that concluded that "the United States could add approximately 60,000 [[Megawatt|MW]] of new hydropower capacity by 2025, potentially creating as many as 700,000 jobs in the process," according to the Committee Report released by the House Energy and Commerce Committee when it referred the Bill to the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report 113-6 - Report on the Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113hrpt6/pdf/CRPT-113hrpt6.pdf|publisher=Government Printing Office|accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

A similar bill, {{USBill|112|H.R.|5892}}, was introduced in the [[112th United States Congress]], where it passed the House by a vote of 372-0, but was never voted on in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 5892|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/5892/actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedural history==

===House===
The Bill was introduced into the House on January 15, 2013 by [[Cathy McMorris Rodgers|Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA)]].  It was sent to the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] and the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power]]. It passed the House by a vote of 422-0 on February 13, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 267 - Major Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/267/actions?q=HR%20267|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senate===
After passing in the House, the Bill was referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]] on February 14, 2013.  A ranking member of the Committee, [[Lisa Murkowski|Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK)]], told [[The Hill (newspaper)|''The Hill'']] that she expected the Bill to pass in the Senate as well.&lt;ref name="hillFeb13" /&gt;  Power Magazine also reported that chances for passage in the Senate looked good.&lt;ref name=powermag1&gt;{{cite web|last=Patel|first=Sonal|title=House Unanimously Approves Hydro Bill, Prospects for Passage Are Positive in Senate|url=http://www.powermag.com/news/5401.html|publisher=Power Magazine|accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions/Elements of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''

Section 1 of the Bill provides the short title of the bill, "Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013", and gives a table of contents for the bill.&lt;ref name="267text" /&gt;

Section 2 of the Bill provides the "Findings" of Congress.  It has a short description of facts that Congress lists as a way to provide context for why they are writing the bill and want to make this new law.  In this bill, Congress lists the number of Americans who work in the [[hydropower]] industry (approximately 300,&amp;nbsp;000), the number of [[dam]]s in the United States that are used to produce power (less than 3% of 80,&amp;nbsp;000), and that hydropower provides 7% of the energy generated in the United States.&lt;ref name=267text&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Text - H.R. 267 - 113th Congress|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c113:H.R.267.RFS:/|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 3 of the Bill would amend the [[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act|Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA)]] to increase from 5,000 to 10,000 [[Kilowatt#Kilowatt|kilowatts]] the size of small [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] projects which the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)]] may exempt from its license requirements.&lt;ref name="267text" /&gt;

Section 4 of the Bill would amend the [[Federal Power Act]] to revise the limitation on the maximum installation capacity of qualifying conduit hydropower facilities that are eligible for an exemption from licensing requirements.&lt;ref name="267text" /&gt;

It would also require any person, state, or municipality proposing to construct a qualifying [[conduit hydroelectricity]] facility to file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) a notice of intent to do so. It would require FERC, within 15 days after receiving such a notice of intent, to make an initial determination as to whether the facility meets the qualifying criteria.&lt;ref name="267text" /&gt;

The Bill would then waive the license requirements for any [[Conduit hydroelectricity]] facility that:
:(1) uses for electric power generation only the hydroelectric potential of a non-federally owned conduit,
:(2) has a maximum installed capacity of 5 [[Watt#Megawatt|megawatts]], and
:(3) is not currently licensed or exempted from license requirements.&lt;ref name="267text" /&gt;

The bill then redefines "conduit" to specify any tunnel, canal, pipeline, aqueduct, flume, ditch, or similar man-made water conveyance operated for the distribution of water for agricultural, municipal, or industrial consumption and not primarily for the [[Electricity generation|generation of electricity]].&lt;ref name="267text" /&gt;

The new law would authorize the FERC to:
:(1) exempt from license requirements any electric power generation facility that utilizes for such generation only the hydroelectric potential of a conduit, and has an installed capacity or 40 megawatts or fewer; and, in section 5, the FERC would be authorized to
:(2) extend the preliminary permit period for up to 2 additional years beyond the 3 years otherwise allowed if it finds that the permittee has implemented activities under the permit in [[Good faith (law)|good faith]] and with reasonable diligence.&lt;ref name="267text" /&gt;

Section 6 of the Bill would direct the FERC to:
:(1) investigate the feasibility of issuing a license for hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed loop pumped storage projects during a two-year period, and
:(2) hold workshops and develop hydropower pilot projects.&lt;ref name="267text" /&gt;

Finally, Section 7 would direct the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] to study:
:(1) the technical flexibility that existing pumped storage facilities can provide to support intermittent renewable electric energy generation, including the potential for such facilities to be upgraded or retrofitted with advanced commercially available technology; and
:(2) the technical potential of existing pumped storage facilities and new advanced pumped storage facilities to provide grid reliability benefits.  A year after the enactment of the Bill, should it become law, the Department of Energy would be required to submit a report about the results of this study to the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] and the [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]] and provide any suggestions it has based on the results of the study.&lt;ref name="267text" /&gt;

==Perception and impact==

Some environmental groups, such as [[American Rivers]], support the bill because it primarily addresses only very small power plants, which are less disruptive to the environment than the much larger megadams many environmental groups oppose.&lt;ref name="hillFeb13" /&gt;

===Congressional Budget Office===
The [[Congressional Budget Office]] report on the Bill indicates that it would have no significant net impact on the federal budget.  The changes made by the bill would reduce the workload for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  The studies the bill requires the Department of Energy to make are similar to on-going studies of hydropower and would not require much additional funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Publication 43874 - H.R. 267, the Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43874|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2544">'''ISO 15022''' is an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard for [[messaging]] used in transactions between financial institutions.  Participants in the [[financial industry]] need a common representation of the [[financial transaction]]s they perform and this standard defines general message [[Ontology (information science)|schema]], which in turn are used by organizations to define messages in a complete and unambiguous way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO 15022 | url=http://www.iso15022.org}}(official website)&lt;/ref&gt; This results in efficiency, lower costs, and the avoidance of errors.  Prior to standardization in this area, there were overlapping standards, or [[ad hoc]] approaches where there was a functional gap and no standard.

== Transition from ISO 7775 to ISO 15022 ==
ISO 15022 replaces the previous securities messaging standard [[ISO 7775]]. It provides two syntaxes: one compatible with the preceding standards, and one fairly compatible with [[EDIFACT]]. [[ISO 20022]] is the successor to ISO 15022.
[[SWIFT]] is the Registration Authority for ISO 15022. In SWIFT Financial messages, the standard is applied to variety of [[SWIFT:Message Types|message types]].

ISO 15022 was developed in 1995 to provide the securities industry with a better tool to create message standards. The previous standard ISO 7775 contained the actual message standards themselves (like the SWIFT message types MT 520 or MT 534), which did not make it easy to make changes to these standards (because each time one needs to pass a number of time-consuming standard cycles). To avoid this, ISO 15022 does not contain the actual messages, but contains a set of rules and guidelines to build messages. If these rules and guidelines are adhered to (checked by the registration authority) the resulting message (format) is automatically an ISO 15022-compliant standard. Examples are the [[MT103]], [[MT202 Cov]], MT540, MT542, MT548, etc.

==Parts==
ISO 15022 is split into two parts:

*ISO 15022-1:1999 ''Securities -- Scheme for messages (Data Field Dictionary) -- Part 1: Data field and message design rules and guidelines''
*ISO 15022-2:1999 ''Securities -- Scheme for messages (Data Field Dictionary) -- Part 2: Maintenance of the Data Field Dictionary and Catalogue of Messages''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5383">The '''International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems in Ships''' ('''AFS Convention''') is a 2001 [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) [[treaty]] whereby states agree to prohibit the use of harmful [[anti-fouling paint]]s and other anti-[[fouling]] systems that contain harmful substances. In particular, the use of the [[organotin]] [[tributyltin]] is prohibited, since leaching of that chemical from the hulls of ships has been shown to cause deformations in [[oyster]]s and sex changes in [[whelk]]s.

The Convention was concluded in [[London]] on 5 October 2001 and entered into force on 17 September 2008. As of November 2018, it has been ratified by 81 states, which includes 79 [[United Nations member states]] plus the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]]. A ratifying state agrees to enforce the prohibitions of the Convention on all ships flying [[Flag state|its flag]] ''and'' on any ship that enters a port, shipyard, or offshore terminal of the state. The 81 ratifying states represent approximately 94 per cent of the gross tonnage of the world's merchant fleets.

The '''Judicature Acts''' are a series of [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], beginning in the 1870s, which aimed to fuse the hitherto split system of courts in [[England and Wales]]. The first two Acts were the [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873]] (36 &amp; 37 Vict c. 66) and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875 (38 &amp; 39 Vict c. 77), with a further series of amending acts (12 in all by 1899).

By the Act of 1873 (ss. 3, 4), the [[Court of Chancery]], the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of Queen's Bench]] (known as the King's Bench when there is a male Sovereign), the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], the [[Court of Exchequer Chamber|Court of Exchequer]], the [[High Court of Admiralty]], the [[Court of Probate]], and the [[Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes]] were consolidated into the [[Senior Courts of England and Wales|Supreme Court of Judicature]], subdivided into two courts: the "High Court of Justice" ("High Court"), with (broadly speaking) original jurisdiction, and the "Court of Appeal". Besides this restructuring, the objects of the act were threefold:

*to combine the historically separate courts of [[common law]] and [[equity (law)|equity]];
*to establish for all divisions of the new Supreme Court a uniform system of [[pleading]] and procedure; and
*to provide for the enforcement of the same rule of law in those cases where equity and common law recognised different rules.

The enactment was bold and revolutionary. By one section, the Queen's Bench, the Common Pleas (in which only [[Serjeant-at-law|serjeants]] formerly had the [[right of audience]]), and the Exchequer, and all their jurisdiction, whether criminal, legal, or equitable, were vested in the new court. The fusion of the systems of law and equity was not complete, however, as the Chancery (equity) division retained a distinct existence within the new court from the Queen's Bench (common law) division, having a certain range of legal questions under its exclusive control, and possessing to a certain extent a peculiar machinery of its own for carrying its decrees into execution. Nevertheless, all actions could now for the first time be initiated in a single High Court, and (subject to such special assignments of business as mentioned) could be tried in any of its divisions.

==Common law and equity==
The procedure of the common law courts had developed along highly technical and stylised lines. For example, to bring an action in the common law courts a litigant had to file a "[[writ]]" chosen from a set of standard forms. The court would only recognise certain "forms of action", and this led to the widespread use of [[legal fiction]]s, with litigants disguising their claims when they did not fit into a standard recognised "form". The emphasis on rigid adherence to established forms led to substantial injustice.

On the other hand, the [[Court of Chancery]] (a court of equity) ran separately and parallel to the common law courts, and emphasised the need to "do justice" on the basis of the [[Lord Chancellor]]'s conscience, softening the blunt instrument of the common law. However, by the nineteenth century proceedings before the Court of Chancery often dragged on and on, with cases not being decided for years at a time (a problem that was [[parody|parodied]] by [[Charles Dickens]] in the fictional case of ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'' in ''[[Bleak House]]''). Also, the practice of the court departed from the original principle of the Lord Chancellor's conscience, wary of its legal superiority, clarified for once and for all 1615, wherever it conflicted with the common law.&lt;ref&gt;This was the [[precedent]] set by the decision of the absolute monarch as advised by the Attorney-Generals in a set of proceedings under both court systems in the ''[[Earl of Oxford's Case]]'' (1615)&lt;/ref&gt; The court undertook self-restraint to safeguard its position. It elaborated the [[maxims of equity]], many centuries old, that restrict its jurisdiction to certain fields of law, impose preconditions for suits/applications and curtail its remedies (particularly damages) which equity might award if there were no common law courts or statute. 

The existence of these two separate systems in some of the more common areas of law enabled each party to go "forum shopping", selecting whichever of the two systems would most likely give judgment in his or her favour. A wealthy loser in one court would often try a court in the other system, for good measure.

The solution adopted by the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 was to amalgamate the courts into one Supreme Court of Judicature which was directed to administer both law and equity.&lt;ref&gt; Snell, Edmund Henry Turner; Megarry, R.E.; Baker, P.V. (1960). ''Snell's Principles of Equity'' (25 ed.). London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Pleadings]] became more relaxed, with the emphasis shifting from the 'form' of action to the 'cause' (or a set of causes) of action. Writs for action were filled out for a litigant stating facts, without any necessity of pigeonholing them into specific forms. The same court was now able to apply rules of the common law and the rules of equity, depending on what the substantial justice of a case required, and depending on what specific area of law the pleadings involved. The result was that, when the issues arising from the causes of action were decided in favour of one party, that party got relief.

==Overview==
[[Image:SirFitzroyKelly.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fitzroy Kelly|Sir Fitzroy Kelly]] was the last leading [[Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer]].]]
There were originally three common law divisions of the High Court corresponding with the three former courts of common law. However, after the deaths of [[Fitzroy Kelly|Lord Chief Baron Kelly]] (on 17 September 1880), and [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] [[Sir Alexander Cockburn, 12th Baronet|Cockburn]] (on 10 November 1880), the Common Pleas and Exchequer divisions were consolidated (by an [[Order in Council]] of 10 December 1880) with the Queen's Bench division into a single division, under the [[presidency]] of the Lord Chief Justice of England, to whom, by the [[Judicature Act 1881]] s. 25, all the statutory jurisdiction of the Chief Baron and the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas was transferred. The High Court, therefore, came to consist of the Chancery division, the common law division (known as the Queen's Bench division), and the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty division. To the Queen's Bench division was also attached, by an order of the Lord Chancellor dated 1 January 1884, the business of the [[London]] [[Court of Bankruptcy]].

The keystone of the structure created by the Judicature Acts was a strong court of appeal. The House of Lords remained the last court of appeal, as before the Acts, but its judicial functions were transferred in practice to an appellate committee, consisting of the lord chancellor and other peers who had held high judicial office, and certain [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary]] created by the [[Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876]].

The High Court and Court of Appeal were formerly referred to as comprising the Supreme Court of Judicature,&lt;ref&gt;In ''Le systeme judiciaire de la Grande Bretagne,'' the Comte de Franqueville criticises the use of the word "supreme" as a designation of this court and was also severe on the inconsistent use of the terms "division" and "court" in many different senses (i. i 80 - i 8 i).
&lt;/ref&gt; a concept wholly distinct from the current [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]

==Pleading==
The most important matter dealt with by the rules is the mode of pleading. The authors of the Judicature Act had before them two systems of pleading, both of which were open to criticism. The common law pleadings (it was said) did not state the facts on which the pleader relied, but only the legal aspect of the facts or the inferences from them, while the chancery pleadings were lengthy, tedious and to a large extent irrelevant and useless.

There was some exaggeration in both statements. In pursuing the [[fusion of law and equity]] which was the dominant legal idea of law reformers of that period, the framers of the first set of rules devised a system which they thought would meet the defects of both systems, and be appropriate for both the common-law and the chancery divisions. In a normal case, the [[plaintiff]] delivered his statement of claim, in which he was to set forth concisely the facts on which he relied, and the relief which he asked. The [[defendant]] then delivered his statement of defence, in which he was to say whether he admitted or denied the plaintiff's facts (every [[averment]] not traversed being taken to be admitted),{{jargon inline|date=August 2016}} and any additional facts and legal defences on which he relied. The plaintiff might then reply, and the defendant rejoin, and so on until the pleaders had exhausted themselves. This system of pleading was not a bad one if accompanied by the right of either party to demur to his opponent's pleading, i.e. to say, "admitting all your averments of fact to be true, you still have no cause of action", or "defence" (as the case may be).

It may be, however, that the authors of the new system were too intent on uniformity when they abolished the common-law pleading, which, shorn of its abuses (as it had been by the Common Law Procedure Acts), was an admirable instrument for defining the issue between the parties though unsuited for the more complicated cases which are tried in chancery, and it might possibly have been better to try the new system in the first instance in the chancery division only.

It should be added that the rules contain provisions for actions being tried without pleadings if the defendant does not require a statement of claim, and for the plaintiff in an action of debt obtaining immediate judgment unless the defendant gets leave to defend. In the chancery division there are of course no pleadings in those matters which by the rules can be disposed of by [[summons]] in chambers instead of by ordinary suit as formerly.

The judges seem to have been dissatisfied with the effect of their former rules, for in 1883 they issued a fresh set of consolidated rules, which, with subsequent amendments, are those now in force. By these rules a further attempt was made to prune the exuberance of pleading. Concise forms of statement of claim and defence were given in the appendix for adoption by the pleader. It is true that these forms do not display a high standard of excellence in draftsmanship, and it was said that many of them were undoubtedly demurrable, but that was not of much importance.

[[Demurrer]]s were abolished, and instead it was provided that any point of law raised by the pleadings should be disposed of at or after the trial, provided that by consent or order of the court they might be set down and disposed of before the trial (Order xxv. rules I, 2). This, in the opinion of Lord Davey in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Toth ed., xxx. 146&lt;/ref&gt; was a disastrous change. The right of either party to challenge his opponent ''in limine'', either where the question between them was purely one of law, or where even the view of the facts taken and alleged by his opponent did not constitute a cause of action or defence, was a most valuable one, and tended to the curtailment of both the delay and the expense of litigation. Any possibility of abuse by frivolous or technical demurrers (as undoubtedly was formerly the case) had been met by powers of [[wikt:amendment|amendment]] and the infliction of [[Costs (English law)|costs]].

Many of the most important questions of law had been decided on [[demurrer]] both in common law and chancery. Lord Davey considered that demurrer was a useful and satisfactory mode of trying questions in chancery (on bill and demurrer), and it was frequently adopted in preference to a special case, which requires the statement of facts to be agreed to by both parties and was consequently more difficult and expensive. It is obvious that a rule which makes the normal time for decision of questions at law the trial or subsequently, and a preliminary decision the exception, and such exception dependent on the consent of both parties or an order of the court, is a poor substitute for a demurrer as of right, and it has proved so in practice. The editors of the ''Yearly Practice'' for 1901 ([[Kenneth Muir Mackenzie, 1st Baron Muir-Mackenzie|Muir Mackenzie]], Lushington and Fox) said (p.&amp;nbsp;272): "Points of law raised by the pleadings are usually disposed of at the trial or on further consideration after the trial of the issues of fact," that is to say, after the delay, worry and expense of a trial of disputed questions of fact which after all may turn out to be unnecessary.

The abolition of demurrers has also (it is believed) had a prejudicial effect on the standard of legal accuracy and knowledge required in practitioners. Formerly the pleader had the fear of a demurrer before him. Nowadays, he need not stop to think whether his cause of action or defence will hold water or not, and anything which is not obviously frivolous or vexatious will do by way of pleading for the purpose of the trial and for getting the opposite party into the box.

==Juries==
Another change was made by the rules of 1883, which was regarded by some common law lawyers as revolutionary. Formerly every issue of fact in a common law action, including the amount of damage, had to be decided by the [[verdict]] of a [[jury]]. "The effect of the rules of 1883," said [[Lord Lindley]], who was a member of the rule committee, "was to make trial without a jury the normal mode of trial, except where trial with a jury is ordered under rules 6 or 7a, or may be had without an order under rule 2".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Timson v Wilson]]'' 38 Ch D 72, 76&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the rules may be thus summarised:

*In the Chancery division no trial by jury unless ordered by the [[judge]].
*Generally the judge could order trial without a jury of any cause or issue, which before the Judicature Act might have been so tried without consent of parties, or which involves prolonged investigation of documents or accounts, or scientific or local investigation.
*Either party had a right to a jury in actions of [[slander]], [[libel]], false imprisonment, malicious [[prosecution]], [[seduction]] or [[breach of promise]] of marriage, upon notice without order;
*or in any other action, by order.
*Subject as above, actions were to be tried without a jury unless the judge, of his own motion, otherwise orders.

==Abandonment==
{{main|Abandonment (legal)}}
Among the specific changes to procedure that occurred as a result of enactment of the Judicature Acts was one impacting on the matter of "abandonment of an action". Such an abandonment involves the discontinuance of proceedings commenced in the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court]], typically emerging because a plaintiff is convinced that he will not succeed in a [[civil action]]. Prior to the 1875 Act, considerable latitude was allowed as to the time when a suitor might abandon his action, and yet preserve his right to bring another action on the same suit (see [[nonsuit]]); but since 1875 this right has been considerably curtailed, and a plaintiff who has delivered his reply (see [[pleading]]), and afterwards wishes to abandon his action, can generally obtain leave so to do only on condition of bringing no further proceedings in the matter.

==Other changes==
Further steps have been taken with a view to simplification of procedure. By Order xxx. rule i (as amended in 1897), a summons, called a summons for directions, has to be taken out by a plaintiff immediately after the appearance of the defendant, and upon such summons an order is to be made respecting pleadings, and a number of interlocutory proceedings. To make such an order at that early stage would seem to demand a prescience and intelligent anticipation of future events which can hardly be expected of a master, or even a judge in chambers, except in simple cases, involving a single issue of law or fact which the parties are agreed in presenting to the court. The effect of the rule is that the plaintiff cannot deliver his statement of claim, or take any step in the action without the leave of the judge. In Chancery cases the order usually made is that the plaintiff deliver his .statement of claim, and the rest of the summons stand over, and the practical effect is merely to add a few pounds to the costs. It may be doubted whether, as applied to the majority of actions, the rule does not proceed on wrong lines, and whether it would not be better to leave the parties, who know the exigencies of their case better even than a judge in chambers, to proceed in their own way, subject to stringent provisions for immediate payment of the costs occasioned by unnecessary, vexatious, or [[dilatory]] proceedings. The order does not apply to admiralty cases or to proceedings under the order next mentioned.

The [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877]] followed the same lines as the English Acts: the pre-existing courts were consolidated into a Supreme Court of Judicature, consisting of a High Court of Justice and a Court of Appeal. The Judicature Acts did not affect the Scottish judicial system, but the Appellate Jurisdiction Act included the [[Court of Session]] among the courts from which an appeal would lie to the House of Lords.

By 1920, McCormick had become so active in the business affairs of the ''Chicago Tribune'' that he left the firm to take over as the ''Tribune''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s publisher.

As a consequence of McCormick's outspoken, crusading editorial policy the ''Tribune'' soon required the services of a first-class trial lawyer to defend against a slew of defamation cases. McCormick turned to [[Weymouth Kirkland]], who had joined the firm in 1915. Over the course of his career, Kirkland attracted some of the firm's largest clients. Often described as a brilliant trial lawyer, he served as chief counsel to the ''Tribune'' and other newspapers in various cases that became landmarks in [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] and [[Defamation|libel law]].&lt;ref name="kirkland.com"/&gt;

Kirkland's partner, [[Howard Ellis]], was a pivotal contributor to the firm's early history. Ellis joined the firm as a young associate in 1915. Ellis assisted Kirkland in many of his most famous trials, in which they defended clients such as [[Standard Oil|Standard Oil Company]], the [[Associated Press]], the [[Chicago Board of Trade]], among others. The duo made legal history in a landmark [[libel]] suit brought by [[Henry Ford]] in 1919, during which Ellis pioneered the defense of [[fair comment]], which is today a basic right of free speech.

In 1938, Kirkland and Ellis hired young trial lawyer [[Hammond Chaffetz|Hammond E. Chaffetz]] from the U.S. Department of Justice. Chaffetz is noted for ushering in "the modern era of the firm".&lt;ref name="kirkland.com"/&gt; A skilled lawyer and leader, Chaffetz employed a personal touch in his recruiting efforts, often taking outstanding law students to dinners and on walks to bring them into the firm. In his six decades at the firm, Chaffetz's techniques were noted for helping the firm grow to about 780 lawyers, making it one of the top 30 largest in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/17/us/h-e-chaffetz-93-lawyer-on-antitrust-and-price-fixing.html|title=H.

In recent years, Kirkland has stood out as the most consistently growing [[The American Lawyer|Am Law 200]] firm. The firm's revenue increased by 147 percent over the last 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kirkland.com/files/Legal_Business_Global_100_Wrecking_Ball_Jeffrey-Hammes.pdf|title=Wrecking Ball|last=|first=|date=August 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2009 and 2016, Kirkland was one of nine Am Law 200 firms to have posted growth in six of the seven years in revenue, revenue per lawyer, profit per lawyer, and profit per equity partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.com/2018/02/28/kirkland-and-latham-two-different-paths-to-success/|title=Kirkland and Latham: Two Different Paths to Success {{!}} Law.com|work=Law.com|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those nine, Kirkland posted the best cumulative growth in each of those four areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.com/2018/02/28/kirkland-and-latham-two-different-paths-to-success/|title=Kirkland and Latham: Two Different Paths to Success {{!}} Law.com|work=Law.com|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, Kirkland &amp; Ellis hired all of the attorneys from the firm [[Bancroft PLLC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lat|first1=David|title=Kirkland &amp; Ellis Hires Paul Clement, Viet Dinh — And All Of Bancroft’s Lawyers!|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/kirkland-ellis-hires-paul-clement-viet-dinh-and-all-of-bancrofts-lawyers/|accessdate=July 2, 2017|work=Above the Law|date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the firm grew revenue by 19 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.com/2018/03/22/what-is-the-new-normal-for-kirkland-ellis/|title=What Is the 'New Normal' for Kirkland &amp; Ellis? {{!}} Law.com|work=Law.com|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

([[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]], 1992) was a court case which established the rights of users to modify copyrighted works for their own use.&lt;ref name="Ninth_Circuit_May_1992"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/964/965/341457/ |title=964 F.2d 965: Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc., v. Nintendo of America, Inc., |work=law.justia.com |accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case revolved around whether or not the [[Game Genie]] device which could modify video games in real time constituted creating a [[derivative work]].

==Background==
Under license from UK company [[Codemasters]], [[Galoob]] manufactured an add-on product for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)]] called [[Game Genie]], which allowed users to modify [[video game]]s by entering in certain codes; for example, a code might make the player's character invincible by negating the programming that updates the character's health amount.

[[Nintendo]], which sold a [[Video game console|video game system]] and video games that could be modified by Game Genie, sued Galoob for [[copyright infringement]], alleging that modifying a game with the Game Genie created a [[derivative work]], violating Nintendo's [[copyright]] in their video games.

==Lawsuit==
The court battle began in May 1990, when Galoob filed a complaint against Nintendo in [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]], seeking a [[declaratory judgment]] that the Game Genie did not violate Nintendo's copyrights, as well as an [[injunction]] preventing Nintendo from modifying their [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game system to make it incompatible with the Game Genie. Nintendo responded by filing a complaint against Galoob, seeking an injunction preventing Galoob from selling the Game Genie.&lt;ref name="District_Court_July_1991" /&gt;

A similar court case (''[[Midway Manufacturing Co. v. Artic International, Inc.]]'') had previously been decided in favor of the copyright holder. Nintendo relied heavily on this case as precedent for its legal arguments.&lt;ref name="District_Court_July_1991"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14167398686354689030&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr |title=Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc., 780 F. Supp. 1283 - Dist. Court, ND California 1991 |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1990, the court granted Nintendo a [[preliminary injunction]], preventing Galoob from selling the Game Genie until the court matter was resolved. It also ordered Nintendo to post a bond (initially $100,000, later increased to $15 million), in order to ensure Galoob be compensated for sales lost during the injunction, should Galoob win the case.&lt;ref name="Ninth_Circuit_Feb_1994"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://openjurist.org/16/f3d/1032/nintendo-of-america-inc-v-lewis-galoob-toys-inc |title=16 F3d 1032 Nintendo Of America Inc V. Lewis Galoob Toys Inc |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galoob appealed the injunction to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]], but lost.&lt;ref name="District_Court_July_1991" /&gt;

After over a year of legal wrangling, the trial concluded in July 1991, with District Judge [[Fern M. Smith]] ruling in favor of Galoob, declaring that the Game Genie did not violate Nintendo's copyrights. In her ruling, Smith compared usage of the Game Genie to "skipping portions of a book" or fast-forwarding through a purchased movie; thus the altered game content did not constitute the creation of a derivative work as Nintendo had argued. Smith wrote that "Having paid Nintendo a fair return, the consumer may experiment with the product and create new variations of play, for personal enjoyment, without creating a derivative work."&lt;ref name="District_Court_July_1991" /&gt; Nintendo appealed the verdict to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but lost as the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision.&lt;ref name="Ninth_Circuit_May_1992" /&gt;

In December 1991, a hearing was held to determine how much of the $15 million bond would be awarded to Galoob to compensate for losses during the approximately one-year period they were prohibited from selling the Game Genie. The court found that, because Galoob's losses actually exceeded $15 million, Galoob was entitled to the entire amount, plus legal fees. Nintendo appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, but lost again.&lt;ref name="Ninth_Circuit_Feb_1994" /&gt;

==Legacy==
The Ninth Circuit referred to the ''Galoob'' ruling in ''[[Micro Star v. FormGen Inc.]]'', a case involving user-created levels for the video game Duke Nukem 3D. In that case, Judge [[Alex Kozinski]] concluded that the fair use analysis in ''Galoob v. Nintendo'' is [[Dictum|dicta]], and ruled in favor of the copyright holder.&lt;ref name=microstar&gt;''Micro Star v. FormGen Inc.'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/154/154.F3d.1107.html 154.F.3d 1107] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517124947/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/154/154.F3d.1107.html |date=2010-05-17 }} (9th Cir. 1999) (opinion full text).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 case involving the [[ClearPlay]] technology raised a similar issue in the context of home viewing of DVDs. At no point was a copy of the DVD made; rather, offensive parts of the movie were automatically skipped. Hollywood studios and the [[Directors Guild of America]] sued ClearPlay alleging copyright infringement and trademark infringement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011|reason=Need the court case reference and date}} The case, however, was rendered irrelevant by the passage of the [[Family Entertainment and Copyright Act|Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005]], a law that because of its narrow applicability did not abrogate ''Midway'' or affirm ''Galoob''. (There was no judicial opinion issued in the case because it became moot in light of the new law.)

[[S3 Graphics|SonicBlue]] was sued over the commercial-skipping feature of [[ReplayTV]] on similar grounds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011|reason=Need the court case reference and date}} "Your contract when you get the show is you're going to watch the spots [advertisements]. … Any time you skip a commercial … you're actually stealing the programming," asserts Turner Broadcasting CEO Jamie Kellner. He admits that "there's a certain amount of tolerance" for going to the bathroom during commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Hesseldahl | first = Arik  | title = SonicBlue Forced To Spy  | work =  | pages = | publisher = Forbes Magazine | date = May 3, 2002 | url = http://forbesbest.com/2002/05/03/0503sonicblue_print.html    | accessdate = September 18, 2016 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040109123147/http://forbesbest.com/2002/05/03/0503sonicblue_print.html |archivedate = January 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; SonicBlue went bankrupt before the court reached a decision on the merits of the case.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011|reason=if lawsuit was the primary cause of bankruptcy, then attribute also}}

The term '''magistrate''' is used in a variety of systems of governments and laws to refer to a civilian officer who administers the law. In [[ancient Rome]], a ''[[Roman magistrate|magistratus]]'' was one of the highest ranking government officers, and possessed both [[Judiciary|judicial]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] powers. In other parts of the world, such as [[China]], a magistrate was responsible for administration over a particular geographic area. Today, in some jurisdictions, a magistrate is a judicial officer who hears cases in a lower court, and typically deals with more minor or preliminary matters. In other jurisdictions (e.g., [[Magistrate (England and Wales)|England and Wales]]), magistrates may be volunteers without formal legal training who perform a judicial role with regard to minor matters.

==Original meaning==
In [[ancient Rome]], the word ''[[magistratus]]'' referred to one of the highest offices of state. Analogous offices in the local authorities, such as ''[[municipium]]'', were subordinate only to the legislature of which they generally were members, ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]'', often a combination of judicial and executive power, constituting one jurisdiction. In Rome itself, the highest magistrates were members of the so-called ''[[cursus honorum]]'' -'career of honors'. They held both [[judicial]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] power within their sphere of responsibility (hence the modern use of the term "magistrate" to denote both judicial and executive officers), and also had the power to issue ''ius honorarium'', or magisterial law. The [[Consul]] was the highest [[Roman Republic|Roman]] magistrate. The [[Praetor]] (the office was later divided into two, the Urban and Peregrine Praetors) was the highest judge in matters of [[private law]] between individual citizens, while the Curule [[Aedile]]s, who supervised [[public works]] in the city, exercised a limited civil jurisdiction in relation to the [[Market (economics)|market]].&lt;ref&gt;p4 and p18, Nicholas, Barry, ''An Introduction to Roman Law'' (Oxford University Press, 1975) {{ISBN|0-19-876063-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman magistrates were not lawyers, but were advised by [[jurist]]s who were experts in the law.

The term was maintained in most feudal successor states to the western [[Roman Empire]]. However, it was used mainly in Germanic kingdoms, especially in city-states, where the term magistrate was also used as an abstract generic term denoting the highest office, regardless of the formal titles (e.g. Consul, Mayor, Doge), even when that was actually a council. The term "[[chief magistrate]]" applied to the highest official, in sovereign entities the [[head of state]] and/or [[head of government]].

==Continental Europe and its former colonies==
{{See also|Examining magistrate}}
Under the [[Civil law (legal system)|"civil law"]] systems of European countries, such as Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands, ''magistrat'' (French), ''magistrato'' (Italian) and ''magistraat'' (Dutch) are generic terms which comprise both prosecutors and judges, distinguished as the 'standing' versus 'sitting' magistrature, respectively.

In Portugal, besides being used in the scope of the [[Judiciary of Portugal|judiciary]] to designate prosecutors and judges, the term ''magistrado'' was also used to designate certain government officials, like the former civil governors of [[districts of Portugal|district]]. These were referred as "administrative magistrates" to distinguish them from the judiciary magistrates. The [[President of Portugal]] is considered the Supreme Magistrate of the Nation.

In Finland, ''maistraatti'' (the Finnish-language cognate of "magistrate", officially translated as "local register office"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maistraatti.fi/en/|title=Startpage|first=www.maistraatti.fi -|last=toimitusneuvosto|website=www.maistraatti.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a state-appointed local administrative office whose responsibilities include keeping [[Civil registry|population information and public registers]], acting as a [[Notary public|public notary]] and conducting civil marriages.

===Mexico===
In Mexico's Federal Law System, a ''magistrado'' (magistrate) is a superior judge (and the highest-ranking State judge), hierarchically beneath the Supreme Court Justices (Ministros de la Corte Suprema).

The ''magistrado'' reviews the cases seen by a judge in a second term if any of the parties disputes the verdict. For special cases, there are ''magistrados superiores'' (superior magistrates) who review the verdicts of special court and tribunal magistrates.

====England and Wales====
{{Main|Magistrate (England and Wales)}}
In the [[courts of England and Wales]], magistrates—also known as [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] (JPs)—are volunteers who hear prosecutions for and dispose of '[[summary offence]]s' and some '[[Hybrid offence#English law|triable-either-way offences]]' by making orders with regard to and placing additional requirements on offenders. Magistrates/JPs are limited to issuing sentences of no longer than twelve months. Magistrates/JPs have other limitations in their sentencing authority with powers extending to fines, community orders which can include curfews, [[electronic tagging]], requirements to perform unpaid work up to 300 hours, and supervision for up to three years. In more serious cases, magistrates can send '[[Hybrid offence|either-way]]' offenders to the Crown Court for sentencing when the magistrate feels a penalty should be imposed that is more severe than the magistrate is capable of sentencing.

A wide range of other legal matters is within the remit of magistrates. In the past, magistrates have been responsible for granting licenses to sell alcohol, for instance,&lt;ref&gt;Under a law of 1729 which instituted Brewster sessions, a special meeting of quarter sessions (Richardson, John (1974) ''The Local Historian's Encyclopedia''. New Barnet: Historical Publications; p. 270; Hey, David, ed. (1996) ''The Oxford Companion to Local and Family History''. Oxford University Press; pp. 46-47)&lt;/ref&gt; but this function is now exercised by local councils; though, there is a right of appeal to the magistrates' court. Magistrates are also responsible for granting search warrants to the police and other authorities; therefore, it used to be a requirement that they live within a {{convert|15|mi|km|sing=on}} radius of the area they preside over (the ''commission area'') in case they are needed to sign a warrant after hours. However, ''commission areas'' were replaced with ''Local Justice Areas'' by the [[Courts Act 2003]], meaning magistrates no longer need to live within {{convert|15|mi|km}}; although, in practice, many still do. Section 7 of the Courts Act 2003 states that "There shall be a commission of the peace for England and Wales—…b) addressed generally, and not by name, to all such persons as may from time to time hold office as justices of the peace for England and Wales". Thus, every magistrate in England and Wales may act as a magistrate anywhere in England or Wales.

There are two types of magistrates&lt;ref&gt;Courts and Tribunals Judiciary, [http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/who-are-the-judiciary/judicial-roles/magistrates/ Magistrates: who are they...]. Retrieved: 4 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; in England and Wales: justices of the peace and district judges (formerly known as [[stipendiary magistrate]]s) who hold office as members of the professional judiciary. According to requirements, around 50% of magistrates are women. Over 41% of magistrates are retired from employment while others may be self-employed or able to arrange leave from their employment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

No formal qualifications are required, but magistrates require intelligence, common sense, integrity, and the capacity to act fairly. Membership is widely spread throughout the area covered and drawn from all walks of life. Police officers, [[traffic warden]]s, and members of the [[armed forces]], as well as their close relatives will not be appointed, nor will those convicted of certain criminal offences including recent minor offences. All magistrates receive three days of training before sitting, carried out in conjunction with a mentoring program (mentors are magistrates with at least three years' service),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/CrimeJusticeAndTheLaw/Becomingamagistrate/DG_071384 The Magistracy and the work of magistrates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204125539/http://www.direct.gov.uk./en/CrimeJusticeAndTheLaw/Becomingamagistrate/DG_071384 |date=2008-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which covers basic law and procedure. They continue to receive training throughout their judicial career. Additional training is given to magistrates choosing to sit in the Youth Court or those dealing with family matters. New magistrates sit with mentors on at least six occasions during their first eighteen months.

Magistrates are unpaid appointees, but they may receive allowances to cover traveling expenses, subsistence, and loss of earnings for those not paid by their employer while sitting as a magistrate, up to £116.78 a day. A justice of the peace may sit at any magistrates' court in England and Wales, but in practice, they are appointed to their local bench (a colloquial and legal term for the local court) and are provided with advice (especially on sentencing) by a legally qualified Clerk to the Justices. They will normally sit as a panel of three with two as a minimum. Many are members of the [[Magistrates' Association]], which provides advice and training and represents the approximately 28,000 magistrates to the government. The Association also represents magistrates on the Sentencing Guidelines Council.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Members of the second group are known as District Judges (Magistrates' Courts). Unlike magistrates, District Judges (Magistrates' Courts) sit alone. They are appointed by open competition through a process administered by the JAC and are required to be qualified solicitors, barristers, or chartered legal executives. Some also sit in the family court. Questions have been raised by the Magistrates' Association as to the legal safeguards of a single District Judge allowed to hear a case, decide the outcome, and pass sentence without reference to another party.&lt;ref&gt;John Thornhill, Chairman of the Magistrates' Association - Solicitors Journal - April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
In the [[courts of Scotland]], the office of [[stipendiary magistrate]] was established by Section 5 of the [[District Courts (Scotland) Act 1975]],&lt;ref name="act_uk_1975_c20"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|chapter=20|act=District Courts (Scotland) Act 1975|type=act|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|Section 5}} and was replaced by the office of [[sheriff|summary sheriff]] by Section 218 of the [[Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation Scotland|act=Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014|chapter=18|type=act|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]], the lowest level of law-court, the Justice of the Peace Court, is presided over by a [[Justice of the Peace]]. Stipendiary magistrates are, ''ex officio'', justices of the peace, and when sitting in a JP court had the summary criminal jurisdiction and powers of a sheriff.&lt;ref name="act_uk_1975_c20" /&gt;{{RP|Section 5}}

===Australia===

====Federal Magistrate====
A Federal Magistrate was an office created on 23 December 1999 along with the establishment of the Federal Magistrates Court by the [[Australian Government]] as a result of royal assent of the ''Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth)''.&lt;ref name="court name"&gt;Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth) [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fma1999186/s8.html s 8].&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first judicial officers were appointed in 2000; it first applications were filed on 23 June 2000 and the Court’s first sittings were conducted on 3 July 2000 in [[Adelaide]], [[Brisbane]], [[Canberra]], [[Melbourne]], {{NSWcity|Newcastle}}, [[Parramatta]] and [[Townsville]]. 

The [[Federal Magistrates' Court of Australia]] dealt with more minor [[Commonwealth]] law matters which had previously been heard by the [[Federal Court of Australia]] ([[administrative law]], [[bankruptcy]], [[consumer protection]], trade practices, [[human rights]], and [[copyright]]) or the [[Family Court of Australia|Family Court]] (divorce, [[child custody|residence]] [or custody], and contact with [or access to] the children, property division upon divorce, maintenance, and [[child support]]). In some areas, such as bankruptcy and copyright, the court had virtually unlimited jurisdiction.

The Federal Magistrates would hear shorter or less complex matters or matters in which the monetary sum in disputes does not exceed given amounts. For instance, property divisions where the total assets are A$700,000 or less and consumer law matters (trade practices) where the amount claimed is less than $750,000. The first [[Chief Federal Magistrate of Australia|Chief Federal Magistrate]], [[Diana Bryant]] left the court in 2004 when she was appointed Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, the third person to be appointed that position since the establishment of the Family Court. 

Eventually, the Federal Magistrates Court assumed a significant part of the workload of the Federal Court and the Family Court. By May 2004, the court was dealing with 73% of the total number of applications made in the three courts (see the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110406095412/http://www.fmc.gov.au/pubs/docs/04-05pt3.pdf Annual Report of the Federal Magistrates' Court 2004/2005]). The Federal Magistrates Court was exercising jurisdiction well in excess of that of the state magistrates' courts, and similar to that of the District and County courts of the Australian states. 

On 12 April 2013, in recognition of its increased jurisdiction and its role as an intermediate court servicing regional centres as well as capital cities throughout Australia, the Federal Magistrates Court was renamed the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, the Act renamed as the ''Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act 1999'', and its judicial officers received the title "Judge" instead of "Federal Magistrate".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Mediareleases/Pages/2013/Second%20quarter/12April2013-FederalCircuitCourt-of-Australia-and-new-judicial-complaintshandlingprocesscommence.aspx Federal Attorney-General's announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420104325/http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Mediareleases/Pages/2013/Second%20quarter/12April2013-FederalCircuitCourt-of-Australia-and-new-judicial-complaintshandlingprocesscommence.aspx |date=2013-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State Magistrate====
The State Magistrates in Australia derive from the English Magistrates. All Magistrates are salaried officers.

The [[jurisdiction]] of the magistrates varies from [[States and territories of Australia|state to state]]. They preside over courts which are, depending on the state, called Magistrates’ Courts, [[Local Court of New South Wales|Local Courts]], or Courts of Petty Sessions.

Magistrates hear [[bail]] applications, motor licensing applications, applications for orders restraining a given individual from approaching a specific person (“intervention orders” or “apprehended violence orders”), [[summary offence|summary criminal matters]], the least serious [[indictable offence|indictable criminal matters]], and civil matters where the disputed amount does not exceed A$40,000 to A$100,000 (depending on the State).

In some states, such as [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales|NSW]], the Magistrate may appear robed; although, some Magistrates are known to prefer a business suit. Magistrates presiding in the [[Koori Court]] (which deals with [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] [[defendant]]s) were originally of a mind not to appear robed; however, elders within the Indigenous community urged Magistrates to continue wearing robes to mark the solemnity of the court process to defendants. Robing is being considered for Magistrates in other states; however, neither Counsel nor solicitors appear robed in any Australian Magistrates' court. Robing in summary courts is unlikely to extend to the legal profession.

Historically, Magistrates in Australia have been referred to as “Your Worship”. (From [[Old English]] ''weorthscipe'', meaning being worthy of respect.) However, members of the magistracy are now addressed as "Your Honour" in all states. This was partly to recognize the increasing role magistrates play in the administration of justice, but also to recognize the archaic nature of "Your Worship", and the tendency for witnesses and defendants to incorrectly use "Your Honour" in any event. It is also acceptable to address a magistrate simply as Sir or Madam.

===Hong Kong===
{{main|Magistrates' Court (Hong Kong)}}
There are currently seven magistrates' courts in Hong Kong. Magistrates exercise criminal jurisdiction over a wide range of offences. Although there is a general limit of two years' imprisonment or a fine of HK$100,000, certain statutory provisions give Magistrates the power to sentence up to three years' imprisonment and to impose a fine up to HK$5,000,000.

===India===
{{Courts of India}}
{{See also|Judiciary of India}}
There are four categories of magistrates in the [[Judiciary of India]]. This classification is given in the [[Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (India)|Criminal Procedure Code, 1973]] (CrPC). It stipulates that in each [[District Courts of India|sessions district]], there shall be:
* '''a Chief Judicial Magistrate'''
* '''a Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate'''
* a [[Courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class|Judicial Magistrates First Class]], and
* '''an Executive Magistrates''' [including DM, ADMs, SDMs]

1.The '''Chief Judicial Magistrate [CJM]''' (including Additional Chief Judicial Magistrates.) CJMs hear all types of criminal cases. All magistrates' courts are controlled by the CJM. The CJM looks over the work of judicial magistrates, but cannot take any action against them. The CJM can only report the misbehavior of judicial magistrates to the High Court. A court of Chief Judicial Magistrates can sentence a person to jail up to ten years and impose fines of up to {{INRconvert|30000}}. The CJM is the most senior among all magistrates in their district.

2. There is a '''Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate (SDJM)''' in every subdivision. They hear cases related to the Dowry Act, EC Act, and other criminal cases. They also maintain and control the judicial court below them. A court of Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrates may sentence a person to fines of up to ten years and impose fine up to {{INRconvert|25000}}. Judicial magistrates can try criminal cases.

3. A [[Courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class|Judicial Magistrate First Class]] can sentence a person to jail for up to seven years and impose a fine of up to {{INRConvert|15000}}.

4. An Executive Magistrate is an officer of the Executive branch (as opposed to the Judicial branch) who is invested with specific powers under both the [[CrPC]] and the [[Indian Penal Code]] (IPC). These powers are conferred by Sections 107-110, 133, 144, 145, and 147 of the [[CrPC]]. These officers cannot try any accused nor pass verdicts. A person arrested on the orders of a court located outside the local jurisdiction should be produced before an Executive Magistrate who can also set the [[bail]] amount for the arrested individual to avoid police custody, depending on the terms of the [[Warrant (law)|warrant]]. The Executive Magistrate also can pass orders restraining persons from committing a particular act or preventing persons from entering an area ([[Section 144]] [[CrPC]]). There is no specific provision to order a "[[curfew]]". The Executive Magistrates alone are authorised to use force against people. In plain language, they alone can disperse an "[[unlawful assembly]]". Technically, the police are to assist the Executive Magistrate. Executive Magistrates can dictate to the police the manner of force ([[baton charge]]/ tear gas/blank fire/firing) and also, how much force should be used. They can also seek the assistance of the Armed Forces to quell a [[riot]].

Each District contains the following Judicial Magistrates:
* a Chief Judicial Magistrate [CJM]
* One or two Additional Chief Judicial Magistrates [ACJM]
* One or two Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrates [SDJM]
* Five Judicial Magistrates 1st class [JM]

There are, in each Administrative District (as opposed to a Sessions District) the following kinds of Executive Magistrates:
* a [[District Magistrate]] (DM)
* Two or more Additional District Magistrates (ADM)
* Four or more Subdivisional District Magistrates (SDM)and
* At least ten Executive Magistrates
All the Executive Magistrates of the district, except the ADM, are under the control of the DM.

These magistrates are normally conferred on the officers of the Revenue Department, although an officer can be appointed exclusively as an Executive Magistrate. Normally, the Collector of the district is appointed as the ''DM''. Similarly, the Sub-Collectors are appointed as the SDMs. [[Tehsildar]]s and Deputy/Additional Tehsildars are appointed as Executive Magistrates.

Under the old [[CrPC]], there was no distinction between the Executive and Judicial Magistrates; some states still follow the old CrPC.

===Bangladesh===
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure(CrPC),1898; there are two classes of Magistrates in Bangladesh, namely: -

(a) Judicial Magistrate; and

(b) Executive Magistrate.

There shall be four classes of judicial Magistrate, namely:

(a) Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in Metropolitan Area and Chief judicial Magistrate to other areas

(b) Magistrate of the first class, who shall in Metropolitan area, is known as Metropolitan Magistrate

(c) Magistrate of the second class

(d) Magistrate of the third class

====Executive Magistrate====
{{Main|Executive Magistrate of Bangladesh }}
According to the section-10(6)of the Code of Criminal Procedure(CrPC)1898, members of Bangladesh Civil Service(Administration) Cadre, who are in the capacity of Assistant Commissioner, Upozila Nirbahi Officer(UNO), and Additional Deputy Commissioner(ADC) shall be Executive Magistrates and may exercise the power of Executive Magistrate within their existing respective local areas. Besides this, according to the provision of the section-10(5) of CrPC,1898; The Government may, if it thinks it expedient or necessary, appoint any persons employed in the Bangladesh Civil Service (Administration) to be an Executive Magistrate and confer the powers of an Executive Magistrate on any such member.

Every Administrative District has the following Executive Magistrates:

(a) '''[[Deputy Commissioner (Bangladesh)|District Magistrate]]''': In every district and in every Metropolitan Area, the Government shall appoint as many persons as it thinks fit to be Executive Magistrates and shall appoint one of them to be the District Magistrate.

(b) '''Additional District Magistrate (ADM)''': The Government may also appoint any Executive Magistrate to be an Additional District Magistrate. Additional District Magistrates shall have all or any of the powers of a District Magistrate under this Code or under any other law for the time being in force, as the Government may direct.

(c) '''Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC)''': All the ADC's in the district are Executive Magistrate.

(d) '''Upazila Nirbahi Officer or Sub-District Executive Officer'''

(e) '''Assistant Commissioner; including Senior Assistant Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner (Land)'''

===New Zealand===
The position of '''stipendiary magistrate''' in New Zealand was renamed in 1980 to that of '''district court judge'''. The position was often known simply as ''magistrate'', or the postnominal initials '''SM''' after a magistrate's name in newspapers' court reports.

In the late 1990s, a position of '''community magistrate''' was created for district courts on a trial basis. Under this system, two community magistrates were initially required to sit to consider a case; some of these community magistrates are still serving.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, a magistrate is a [[Judicial officer|Judicial Officer]]  appointed to preside over a [[Magistrate's Court|Magistrates' Court]] to a particular jurisdiction under the ''Judicature Act No 02 of 1978''. The post was formally known as Police Magistrate when, magistrates' courts were known as police magistrate courts. Magistrates have jurisdiction over the criminal cases filed under the penal code. They carryout first mortem and post mortem examinations; issue search warrants; arrest warrants produce suspected persons; and grant bail. In many cases magistrates preside over primary courts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=64&amp;lang=en|title=Judicial Hierarchy|first=|last=ICTA|website=www.jsc.gov.lk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unofficial magistrate]]s can be appointed from among the senior lawyers of the local bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/2003/09/10//opinio02.html|title=opinio02|website=www.island.lk}}&lt;/ref&gt;   There are four types of magistrate;

* Chief Magistrate (only of the metropolitan area of [[Colombo]])
* Magistrate/Municipal Magistrate  
* Additional Magistrate (found when there are more than one Magistrate in one station)
* Unofficial Magistrate

===United States===
Magistrates are somewhat less common in the United States than in Europe, but the position does exist in some state jurisdictions and in federal courts.

The term "magistrate" is often used (chiefly in judicial opinions) as a generic term for any independent [[judge]] who is capable of issuing [[Warrant (law)|warrants]], reviewing [[arrest]]s, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.education2020.com/activities/vocab.aspx?keystr=13230&amp;order=08020305&amp;stbl=2196465 Education 2020 Homeschool Console]; Government course - Vocabulary, "usage" section for '''magistrate''': "''The term, magistrate, is often used for any independent judge who is capable of issuing warrants and reviewing arrests.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vwcommonpleas.org/admin.asp|title=Van Wer County Ohio Common Pleas Court General Division|website=vwcommonpleas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used in this way, it does not denote a judge with a particular office. Instead, it denotes (somewhat circularly) a judge or judicial officer who is capable of hearing and deciding a particular matter. That capability is defined by State [[statute]] or by [[common law]]. In [[Virginia]], for example, the Constitution of 1971 created the office of magistrate to replace the use in cities and counties of the [[justice of the peace]], which is common in many states for this function.

As noted above, the terms "magistrate" or "chief magistrate" were sometimes used in the early days of the republic to refer to the [[President of the United States]], as in President [[John Adams]]'s message to the [[U.S. Senate]] upon the death of [[George Washington]]: "His example is now complete, and it will teach wisdom and virtue to magistrates, citizens, and men, not only in the present age, but in future generations, as long as our history shall be read" (December 19, 1799).

====Federal courts====
{{Main|United States magistrate judge}}
In the [[United States federal courts]], a '''magistrate judge''' is a judicial officer authorized by {{UnitedStatesCode|28|631}} ''[[wikt:et seq.|et seq.]]''  They were formerly known as U.S. commissioners, and then as magistrates. Magistrate judges, as they have been designated since 1990, are appointed by the life-term federal [[United States district court|district judges]] of a particular court, serving terms of eight years if full-time, or four years if part-time, and may be reappointed. Magistrate judges conduct a wide range of judicial proceedings to expedite the disposition of the civil and criminal caseloads of the United States district courts. [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] set forth in the statute the powers and responsibilities that could be delegated by district court judges to magistrate judges. To achieve maximum flexibility in meeting the needs of each court, however, Congress left to the individual courts the actual determination of which duties to assign to magistrate judges.

====State courts====
In many [[State court (United States)|state court]] systems in the United States, magistrate courts are the successor to [[Justice of the Peace]] courts, and frequently have authority to handle the trials of civil cases up to a certain dollar amount at issue, applications for [[bail]], arrest and search warrants, and the adjudication of petty or misdemeanor criminal offences.  In [[Ohio]], magistrates are subordinate to the judge or judges who appoint them, and all of their decisions are subject to the review, amendment, approval, or reversal by a judge. In some states, including [[West Virginia]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], magistrates are elected and not appointed.

==Other traditions==

===China===
{{main|County magistrate}}
'''Magistrate''', or '''chief magistrate''', is also a common translation of the Chinese ''xianzhang'' (县长/縣長 ''literally: county leader'') the political head of a [[County (People's Republic of China)|county]] or ''xiàn'' (县/縣) which ranks in the [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#County level|third level of the administrative hierarchy]] of China. The translation dates from [[Imperial era of Chinese history|imperial China]] in which the [[county magistrate]] was the lowest official in the imperial Chinese bureaucracy and had judicial in addition to administrative functions.

In modern-day China, the county leader is elected by the local people's congress but the process is controlled  by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]. Although there are elections at the lower township level, these elections (with one exception, which was considered irregular and illegal) have not extended up to the county level. County leaders, particularly in rural areas, can affect the lives of ordinary people by enforcing central government regulations or by turning a blind eye to their violation.{{source?|date=August 2016}}

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, ''magistrate'' is a designation for the persons holding the most senior executive and judicial offices. On the federal level, the members of the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]], the [[Federal Chancellor of Switzerland|Federal Chancellor,]] and the judges on the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Federal Supreme Court]] are called magistrates.&lt;ref&gt;See art. 1 of the ''Bundesgesetz über Besoldung und berufliche Vorsorge der Magistratspersonen'', [http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/172_121/a1.html SR/RS 172.121].&lt;/ref&gt; The designation of magistrate is not a [[title]] or [[Style (manner of address)|style]]. It does not, by itself, confer any particular privileges.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, magistrates are the heads of government of counties. The county magistrate [[election]]s are heavily and sometimes bitterly contested, and are often a stepping-stone to higher office. County magistrate elections were first open to election in the 1960s and, before the end of [[martial law]] in 1991, were the highest elected position of any real power, and hence, the focus of election campaigns by the [[Tangwai]] movement.

===Kenya===
In Kenya, there are five categories of magistrates, namely: Resident Magistrate, Senior Resident Magistrate, Principal Magistrate, Senior Principal Magistrate, and Chief Magistrate. Chief Magistrate is the highest ranking among magistrates and also assumes administrative control of magistrate courts in his or her jurisdiction. A Chief Magistrate has jurisdiction in a dispute that does not exceed seven million Kenya shillings. For Senior Principal Magistrates, the limit is in disputes not exceeding five million Kenya shillings; for Principal Magistrates it is disputes not exceeding four million Kenya shillings. Senior Resident Magistrates have jurisdiction in disputes not exceeding three million Kenya shillings and Resident Magistrates in disputes not exceeding two million Kenya shillings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenyalaw.org|title=Kenya Law: Home Page|website=www.kenyalaw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* The British humorist [[P.G. Wodehouse]] wrote in one of his ''[[Jeeves and Wooster]]'' stories, "Jeeves and the [[Feudal]] Spirit" (1955), "Well, you know what magistrates are. The lowest form of pond life. When a fellow hasn't the brains and initiative to sell jellied eels, they make him a magistrate." [[Bertie Wooster]] often appeared before magistrates when he was arrested for minor offences.
* A plump and foolish magistrate is a key character in [[Amy Tan]]'s children's book (and the related [[PBS]] television show) ''[[Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat]]''.
* In the post-colonial novel ''[[Waiting for the Barbarians]]'' by [[J. M. Coetzee]], the story is told from the narrative perspective of the magistrate of one of the settlements in what is presumed to be [[Africa]].
* In the [[Walt Disney]] movie ''[[Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier]]'', Crockett is appointed magistrate of the local community.
* Magistrates appear in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe as well. On ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', Constable [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]] often threatens detainees or those he suspects are guilty of various crimes and violations that he will send them to the magistrate, or tells them sarcastically, in response to their pleas of innocence, to "Tell it to the magistrate."
* In the first installment of the popular ''[[StarCraft]]'' real-time strategy series, one plays as a magistrate working for the Confederacy, a cruel government. One later joins the Sons of Korhal, aiding in the rebellion.

'''''Maximum''''' is a 2012 [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] crime/thriller film written and directed by [[Kabeer Kaushik]]. The project features [[Naseeruddin Shah]], [[Sonu Sood]], [[Neha Dhupia]] and [[Vinay Pathak]] in pivotal roles. ''Maximum'' was released on 29 June 2012.&lt;ref name=HT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/cast/id/542149|title=Maximum Cast &amp; Crew}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the film's release, the film got mixed reviews, but was a disaster at the box office.

==Plot==
''Maximum'' revolves around two of [[Mumbai Police]]'s top encounter specialists and their fight for control. This fight goes through a maze of politics, land deals, fake encounters and bad money. Pundit (Sonu Sood) and Inamdar (Naseeruddin Shah) try to overtake each other for power. Each kill the other's informers and divides the Mumbai police. Inamdar and his superiors frame Pundit and he gets suspended. Pundit comes back into the force with the help of a minister, Tiwari (Vinay Pathak). After the Mumbai bombing Inamdar is removed from his position and Pundit is reinstated. Meanwhile, Tiwari takes responsibility for the elections. One night when he is at home his accomplices are shot. He goes to check and finds the culprit to be Pundit. Pundit shoots Pathak.

In flashback it is shown that while Pundit is travelling with his wife, Supriya (Neha Dhupia) shots are fired. In the confusion his car falls into a jungle. After that he shoots all the people and says that they were Niranjan's people. But when he comes back he realises that his wife is no more. Then it is revealed that Tiwari had an offer from the Home Ministry and 700&amp;nbsp;million from Pundit's enemies in exchange for killing Pundit. Instead, his men killed Pundit's wife. That was the reason Pundit shot Tiwari.

Before dying Tiwari confesses that he should not have done what he did. Pundit asks whether Subodh(his superior) knew of this. Finally Pundit shoots Tiwari.

Pundit hands over property documents to a reporter. The reporter tells him that there is no going back once this goes public. Pundit says that he does not want to return. Pundit comes with his daughter and the reporter to leave the city. Meanwhile, Inamdar and his men start shooting at them. Many people from both sides are killed. Meanwhile, the train is about to start. Pundit sends his daughter with his brother and the reporter to catch the train. She is unwilling to leave without him but finally does. An open shootout follows in which both Pundit and Inamdar are shot. A severely injured Pundit runs towards the train to meet his daughter. Before he can do so he is shot by Inamdar. Before dying he manages to shoot Inamdar. Pundit has a last look at his daughter before finally dropping dead.

==Box office==
Maximum had a poor opening facing heavy competition from ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. The second week also went poorly, as the much awaited [[Bol Bachchan]] released.On the third week,it almost disappeared from cinemas due to release of [[Cocktail (2012 film)|Cocktail]] and was declared a disaster grossing only Rs22.5&amp;nbsp;million.

==Production==
The movie was set in Mumbai during 2003. 

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Maximum garnered mostly negative reviews. Aniruddha Guha of [[Daily News and Analysis|DNA]] gave it 2 stars (on 5) and wrote – "Maximum ends up as a 'me too' among many RGV-inspired films in the last few years, even though that may not have been the intention. Sadly, there was potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Guha|first=Aniruddha|title=Aniruddha Guha reviews: Maximum is a cop-out|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/review_aniruddha-guha-reviews-maximum-is-a-cop-out_1708012|accessdate=30 June 2012|newspaper=DNA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janhavi Patel of FilmiTadka rated Maximum with 2 out of 5 stars and wrote in her review – "There is not much to remember when you walk out. The twist in the end is the saving grace of the movie, if we can call it that. Maximum does not deserve your time or money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patel|first=Janhavi|title=Maximum Movie Review|url=http://www.filmitadka.in/201206292362/movie-reviews/maximum-movie-review.html|publisher=FilmiTadka|accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave it 2.5 out of five stars and said – "Maximum isn’t a washout – not by a long chalk. It is well crafted and superbly acted. Sonu Sood in particular leaves a lasting impression as the police officer under fire for excesses committed in the line of duty. The cameos by Vinay Pathak and Rajendra Gupta are impressive. Sadly, the effort is maximum, the impact not quite so".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chatterjee|first=Saibal|title=Review: Maximum|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_Review.aspx?id=724|publisher=NDTV|accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madhureeta Mukherjee writing for Times of India rated it with 3 out of five stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mukherjee|first=Madhureeta|title=Maximum|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/hindi/Maximum/movie-review/14462631.cms|accessdate=30 June 2012|newspaper=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for Hindustan Times, [[Anupama Chopra]] once again gave Maximum 2 stars and commented – "Maximum has stray moments of power but the film feels like a Ram Gopal Varma rehash; mercifully though there are no cameras zooming into teacups like there were in Varma's recently released Department, which was also about power-hungry, corrupt encounter specialists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chopra|first=Anupam|title=Anupama Chopra's review: Maximum|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Reviews/Anupama-Chopra-s-review-Maximum/Article1-881016.aspx|accessdate=30 June 2012|newspaper=Hindustan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social Movie Rating site MOZVO rated MAXIMUM at 1.9 out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rating &amp; Reviews For MAXIMUM|url=http://mozvo.com/movie/maximum-2012|publisher=MOZVO|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''McDaniel v. Paty''''', 435 U.S. 618 (1978), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that struck down the last remaining state restriction against religious ministers holding elected office.

== Background ==
McDaniel was a Baptist minister from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. He filed as a candidate to be a delegate to the [[Constitution of Tennessee#1977 convention and its aftermath|1977 Tennessee State Constitutional Convention]].  His opponent successfully challenged his candidacy based on a state law that forbade ordained ministers from elected office.

== Decision ==
The court ruled that the state law violated both the First and Fourteenth amendments.

The [[Criminal Lawyers' Association]] (CLA) of Canada questioned section 23 of the [[Ontario]] [[Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Ontario)|Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act]]; they desired access to state records of alleged [[misconduct]] by state officials in a [[murder]] trial because they were concerned about the disparity between the findings at trial and the conclusion of the police investigation. The documents in question were three in number, of which two consisted of privileged legal advice to the [[Ontario Provincial Police]].  The CLA claimed that their right in section 2(b) of the [[Charter]] overrode section 23.  The 76-paragraph judgment by [[McLachlin CJ]] and [[Abella J]], with unanimous concurrence, confirmed the constitutionality of section 23, ie, ruled that [[Legal professional privilege|solicitor-client privilege]] override the [[public interest]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=IiMHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT258 Patrick Keyser: "Public Sentinels: A Comparative Study of Australian Solicitors-General"], Routledge 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=RzerCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT334 Laverne Jacobs, Sasha Baglay: "The Nature of Inquisitorial Processes in Administrative Regimes: Global Perspectives"], Routledge 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=LhelDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103 Richard Devlin, Adam Dodek: "Regulating Judges"], Edward Elgar Publishing 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=-F_gyzny_XgC&amp;pg=PT303 Philip Slayton: "Mighty Judgment: How The Supreme Court Of Canada Runs Your Life"], Penguin Canada, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the case dealt with civil rights, which lie under provincial jurisdiction, the case was joined by a plethora of [[Attorneys-General]] who acted as [[intervenors]], most of whom had in their own legislation near-verbatim copies of section 23.

A '''Party Wall Surveyor''' is a person who specialises in resolving disputes arising under the [[Party Wall etc Act 1996]]. This legislation is only applicable to [[England]] and [[Wales]], which, on 1 July 1997, replaced Part VI of the [[London Building Acts (Amendment) Act 1939]], which was only applicable to the [[Inner London]] Boroughs. 

A surveyor appointed under the provisions of the Act has a duty to the Act and not to the party or parties appointing him/her. There is no client-surveyor relationship in the normal sense, as the [[Surveying|surveyor]] has an 'appointing owner'. A person acting as a 'surveyor' under section 10 of the 1996 Act requires no qualifications as a surveyor (or any other profession) and can accept the appointment so long as he or she is not 'a party to the matter' in dispute. 

Owners may choose to appoint someone who has a good working knowledge of the Act. The party wall surveyor's role is to resolve differences between neighbours when building works to a party structure, or within specified distances from a neighbour's property, are proposed. The surveyor (Agreed Surveyor where both parties concur in one person) or surveyors (where each party appoints their own surveyor) will resolve the dispute by making an Award, which is legally binding on both parties.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Bickford-Smith and Colin Sydenham ''Party Walls Law and Practice'' pp.79-96, Jordan Publishing Limited, 3rd Edition 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-84661-179-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership organisations==
About 900 Party Wall Surveyors are members of the [[Pyramus and Thisbe Club]], founded in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Club|url=http://www.partywalls.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=101&amp;Itemid=11|work=Pyramus and Thisbe Club website|accessdate=3 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120914070504/http://www.partywalls.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=101&amp;Itemid=11|archivedate=14 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{More citations needed|date=December 2017}} '''Performing rights''' are the right to perform [[music]] in public. It is part of [[copyright]] law and demands payment to the music’s [[composer]]/[[lyricist]] and [[Music publisher (popular music)|publisher]] (with the [[royalties]] generally split 50/50 between the two). Public performance means that a musician or group who is not the copyright holder is performing a piece of music live, as opposed to the playback of a pre-recorded song. Performances are considered "public" if they take place in a public place and the audience is outside of a normal circle of friends and family, including [[concert]]s, [[nightclub]]s, [[restaurant]]s etc. Public performance also includes broadcast and cable [[television]], [[radio]], and any other transmitted performance of a live song.

Permission to publicly perform a song must be obtained from the copyright holder or a collective rights organization.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In the [[United States]], broadcasters can pay for their use of music in one of two ways: they can obtain permission/license directly from the music’s copyright owner (usually the publisher), or they can obtain a license from [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] , [[SESAC]] &amp; Pro Music Rights to use all of the music in their repertoires. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC &amp; Pro Music Rights are the four performing rights societies in the U.S. and once they receive payment from the broadcasters they are responsible for compensating the music authors and publisher.

On February 4, 2009, Congressman [[John Conyers|John Conyers, Jr.]] introduced [https://www.scribd.com/doc/48460958/Performance-Rights-HR-848 H.R. 848], the Performance Rights Act in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], 111th Congress.  The Bill was referred to the [[House Judiciary Committee]] and on December 14, 2010, it was placed on the Union Calendar, Calendar No. 405. Under this Bill's version, performance rights was broadly designed to protect the civil rights of minority, religious, rural, and small communities with components to public access and education.

Musician and civil rights activist, [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] has spearheaded the H.R. 848 initiative to preserve, promote and protect a legacy of peace for children through his foundation, Mothers Hip Connection, with public awareness educational campaigns on copyright recapturing and reclaiming royalties for children of civil rights era musical performers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

== "Perform the copyrighted work" ==
The primary provisions governing the performing rights of the copyright owner are given under subsections 4 and 6 of § 106 of the U.S Copyright Act.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106|title=17 U.S. Code § 106 - Exclusive rights in copyrighted works|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; S.106 lists the exclusive rights held by the owner of copyright and subsections 4, 6 lists out the specific protected works that the owner can publicly perform. Subsection 6 was added in 1996 in order to allow owners of sound recordings the exclusive right to perform their work publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat062895.html|title=U.S. Copyright Office: Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Ac|website=www.copyright.gov|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1996, the owners of copyright in sound recordings in the United States did not enjoy any rights of public performance but after the amendment a limited right of public performance by means of a digital audio transmission was granted to sound recordings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

§101 of the Act explains that a work is performed when the work is recited, rendered, played, danced, or acted, either directly or by means of any device or process.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101|title=17 U.S. Code § 101 - Definitions|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition gets broader in the case of a motion picture or other audiovisual work where a work is performed when its images are shown in any sequence or when the sounds accompanying the work are audible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to the very broad definition of "perform" virtually every rendition of the copyrighted work would constitute a performance. In addition to the capricious definition, performances of musical compositions and the underlying sound recordings will have to be noted separately. Each time a rendition of some musical work is performed, the sound recording embodying that rendition is also performed, except of course when the musical work was originally created i.e sang into a microphone, because there’s no recording yet. The reason to differentiate between the musical performance and the sound recording is because the copyrights in these things may well be held by different parties and thus be governed by different rules.

In order to restrict this very wide right, copyright owners only have the right to perform their work publicly i.e private performances are exempted from infringement. Though not providing a specific definition of "public" §101 of the Act defines public performance in two ways:

'''Public Place Clause''' :This approach is based on the intuitive meaning of the word 'public'. Under §101, is performance is public when it is made to a gathering of a substantial number of people who are outside the performer's circle of family and friends.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; So, a restaurant playing a song on its radio, which can be heard by the patrons eating food, would constitute a public performance.

'''Transmission Clause''' : A performance is also public when it is transmitted or communicated through any device or process to members of the public regardless of whether the public in question receive the performance in a single place and time, i.e, a transmission received by the public separately and individually would also constitute a public performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, a radio station transmitting a protected work through airwaves or analog waves or cable companies transmitting the protected works through cable directly into a person's home or any individual broadcasting the work on the internet would constitute a public performance under §101.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://copyx.org/files/2014/08/CopyrightX_-_Lecture_Transcripts_Book.pdf|title=CopyrightX: Lecture Transcripts based on lectures of Prof. William W.

== The CableVision Ruling ==
In the case of '''''[[Cartoon Network, LP v. CSC Holdings, Inc.|Cartoon Network, LP v. CSC Holdings, Inc]].,''''' 536 F.3d 121 (2d Cir. 2008) , a consortium of copyright holders like Turner Broadcasting, 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures and Disney along with their subsidiaries sued Cablevision for its "Remote DVR" technology which allowed people to pause, record, replay and rewind previously stored content. The plaintiff challenged this new technology on three grounds.

1) That even the brief retention of the slices of the protected work in that the brief retention of slices of each work in the Broadband Media Router buffer infringed on the plaintiff's right to reproduce the work.

2) That the copies saved on the Cablevision hard drive also constituted an infringement on the plaintiff's right to reproduce the work.

3) That the transmission of the copyrighted work from the Cablevision servers to their customers infringes on their right to public performance of the work.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2006cv04092/285045/61/|title=The Cartoon Network LP. LLLP et al v. CSC Holdings, Inc. et al, No. 1:2006cv04092 - Document 61 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of appeals reversed the finding of the Trial Court and decided the case in Cablevision's favor.  While rejecting the third contention raised by the plaintiff the court assumed  for the sake of its argument that Cablevision was indeed responsible for the transmission.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Court observed that even though for the customer the Remote DVR worked the same way a [[Set-top box|set top DVR]] does, there exists a crucial difference in the two. Instead of sending signals from the remote to an on-set box, the viewer sends signals from the remote through the cable to the Cablevision servers, which then delivers the program to the subscriber’s home.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; So the Court believed that the Remote DVR more closely resembles a [[Video on demand|video-on-demand]] service, whereby a cable subscriber uses his remote and cable box to request transmission of content, such as a movie, stored on computers at the cable company’s facility. But unlike a video-on-demand service, Remote DVR users can only play content that they previously requested to be recorded.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Court ruled that since each subscriber would necessarily have to make her own unique copy of the work while requesting the work, the transmission of that unique work would only be delivered to one person at a time. If Cablevision transmitted the work to multiple subscribers from the same exact copy, then only would the work infringe upon the right of the owners to publicly perform the work.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Thus, the clinching point in the case was the fact that each subscriber had to create their own personal copy of the copyrighted work.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This fact was also emphasized by the solicitor general when advising the Supreme Court not to review the decision.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Performing Rights in India ==
Section 13 of [http://www.copyright.gov.in/Documents/Copyrightrules1957.pdf The Copyright Act, 1957] states that a copyright is allowed to exist in the following classes of works - (a) original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works; (b) cinematograph films; and (c) sound recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov.in/Documents/Copyrightrules1957.pdf|title=The Copyright Act 1957, section 13.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2(d) of the Act defines the meaning of “author” of the work. According to section 2(d) (ii), the composer shall be the “author” of a musical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov.in/Documents/Copyrightrules1957.pdf|title=The Copyright Act 1957, section 2(d).|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, sections 2(d)(v) and 2(d)(vi) were added to the Act by virtue of the 1994 amendment, according to which an author shall also be producer of the cinematograph film or sound recording; or  “''the person who causes the work to be created”'' when the literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work is computer-generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov.in/Documents/Copyrightrules1957.pdf|title=Ibid.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 17 deems the author of a work to be the “first owner” of the underlying copyright, subject to certain exceptions. The crux of these exceptions is that whenever an author creates a work during the course of employment of another, the employer (and not the author) will own the copyright unless there is a contract to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov.in/Documents/Copyrightrules1957.pdf|title=The Copyright Act 1957, section 17.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 14 of the Act accords certain rights in respect of owners of copyrighted works – the right of public performance (or communication to the public) being one of them. Section 14(a)(iii) allows the a literary, dramatic or musical work to be performed in public, or communicated to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov.in/Documents/Copyrightrules1957.pdf|title=The Copyright Act 1957, section 14.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 14(c)(ii) confers a similar right of communication to the public for artistic works, while sections 14(d)(iii) and 14(e)(iii) confer this right on cinematograph films and sound recordings respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov.in/Documents/Copyrightrules1957.pdf|title=Ibid.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recorded song would typically have 3 copyrights. The ‘musical work’ is the musical melody, harmony and rhythm, and the ‘literary work’ is the accompanying lyrics. The composer of the musical work is deemed to be the ‘author’ of the musical work and the person penning the lyrics in deemed to be the ‘author’ of the literary work. The third ‘work’ is the ‘sound recording’ which is created when the musical work and the literary work are recorded onto a fixed medium. The producer responsible for the recording is deemed to be the ‘author’ of the sound recording. Each of these works would be allowed their own separate set of rights (the right of public performance being one of them) under the Copyright Act, regardless of one work being created for another by virtue of an agreement. Therefore, even when a producer has engaged an artist to write a song, the producer’s copyright only extends to the song itself (referred to as a ‘synchronisation right’), and not the underlying lyrics, harmony, melody and rhythm – the rights for which would still vest with the original authors.

Section 13(4) of the Copyright Act recognizes the fact that a ‘sound-recording’ incorporated in a cinematograph film can continue to have an individual copyright, separate and distinct from the copyright in the cinematograph film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov.in/Documents/Copyrightrules1957.pdf|title=The Copyright Act 1957, section 13(4).|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, this provision also recognizes that a musical work and literary work incorporated in a ‘sound-recording’ can have individual copyrights that are distinct from the copyright in the sound recording. Therefore, the law recognizes each category of works as a separate property right that is protected by itself despite being incorporated into another work. Thus, the composer of a musical work or the author of a literary work can continue to maintain copyright in their works despite licensing the same to the producer for the creation of a ‘sound-recording’. The same stands true for a ‘sound recording’ that is incorporated into a cinematograph film.

However, the Supreme Court has ignored the ambit of section 13(4) in the past, specifically with regard to public performance. In ''[https://indiankanoon.org/doc/331232/ Indian Performing Rights Society v Eastern Indian Motion Pictures Association &amp; Ors]''.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/331232/|title=Indian Performing Right Society v. Eastern India Motion Pictures Association, 1977 SCR (3) 206|last=|first=|date=|website=indiankanoon.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that once the author of a lyric or a musical work parts with his portion of his copyright by authorizing a film producer to incorporate it in a cinematographic film, the producer acquires the exclusive right of performing the work in public, without having to secure any further permission of the author of the musical work or lyric. The Court ignored the idea contained in section 13(4), that authors of musical works retain an independent right of public performance even after licensing the same for incorporation in a film. The Court merely relied on the text of section 17, holding that in the absence of a contract to the contrary, the film producers would be exclusive owners of the copyrighted works which were incorporated into their films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/331232/|title=Indian Performing Right Society v. Eastern India Motion Pictures Association, 1977 SCR (3) 206, 222.|last=|first=|date=|website=indiankanoon.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legislature sought to negate the effect of the Court’s judgement by enacting the [http://copyright.gov.in/Documents/CRACT_AMNDMNT_2012.pdf Copyright (Amendment) Act 2012]. As a result of this amendment, the authors would own their rights in the music and lyrics even if they were created for the purpose of a cinematograph film, regardless of anything mentioned in section 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://copyright.gov.in/Documents/CRACT_AMNDMNT_2012.pdf|title=Copyright (Amendment) Act 2012, section 7.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the synchronisation rights in the music have been licensed to the producers of the cinematograph film, the authors continue to own the remaining rights such as the public performance rights in the music and lyrics. These remaining rights too could be licensed away by the authors but the authors would be entitled to certain minimum royalties.

The 2012 Amendment Act was repealed in January 2018 by the [https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/2434/1/A2018-04.pdf Repealing and Amending (Second) Act, 2017].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/2434/1/A2018-04.pdf|title=The Repealing and Amending (Second) Act 2017, section 2, read with Schedule 1.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive''' 2002/58/EC on Privacy and Electronic Communications, otherwise known as '''ePrivacy Directive''' (ePD), is an [[Directive (European Union)|EU directive]] on data protection and privacy in the digital age. It presents a continuation of earlier efforts, most directly the [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data|Data Protection Directive]]. It deals with the regulation of a number of important issues such as confidentiality of information, treatment of traffic data, [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] and [[HTTP cookie|cookies]]. This Directive has been amended by Directive 2009/136, which introduces several changes, especially in what concerns cookies, that are now subject to prior consent.

The [[ePrivacy Regulation (European Union)|ePrivacy Regulation]] (ePR) is estimated to come in effect somewhere in 2019 and will repeal the ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC and accompany the [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR) and regulate the requirements for consent to the use of cookies and opt-out options.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/proposal-eprivacy-regulation ePrivacy Regulation on Europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eprivacy.eu/en/consulting/general-data-protection-regulation/ ePrivacy Regulation and the GDPR on eprivacy.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://privacylawblog.fieldfisher.com/2017/the-new-e-privacy-regulation-what-you-need-to-know/ Highlights ePrivacy Regulation on fieldfisher.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject-matter and Scope==
The Electronic Privacy Directive has been drafted specifically to address the requirements of new digital technologies and ease the advance of electronic communications services.&lt;ref&gt;See Preamble of the Directive&lt;/ref&gt; The Directive complements the [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data|Data Protection Directive]] and applies to all matters which are not specifically covered by that Directive.&lt;ref&gt;see Article 1&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the subject of the Directive is the "right to privacy in the electronic communication sector" and free movement of data, communication equipment and services. 

The Directive does not apply to Titles V and VI ([[Common Foreign and Security Policy|Second]] and [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|Third]] [[Three pillars of the European Union|Pillars constituting the European Union]]). Likewise, it does not apply to issues concerning public security and defence, state security and criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;Article 1(3)&lt;/ref&gt; The interception of data was however covered by the [[Data Retention Directive|EU Data Retention Directive]], prior to its annulment by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]].

Contrary to the Data Protection Directive, which specifically addresses only individuals, Article 1(2) makes it clear that ePrivacy Directive also applies to legal persons.

==Main provisions==
The first general obligation in the Directive is to provide security of services.&lt;ref&gt;Article 4&lt;/ref&gt; The addressees are providers of electronic communications services. This obligation also includes the duty to inform the subscribers whenever there is a particular risk, such as a virus or other malware attack.&lt;ref&gt;Article 4(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

The second general obligation is for the confidentiality of information to be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Article 5&lt;/ref&gt; The addressees are [[Member state|Member States]], who should prohibit listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of communication and "related traffic", unless the users have given their consent or conditions of Article 15(1) have been fulfilled.  

===Data retention and other issues===
The directive obliges the providers of services to erase or anonymise the traffic data processed when no longer needed, unless the conditions from Article 15 have been fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Article 6&lt;/ref&gt; Retention is allowed for billing purposes but only as long as the [[statute of limitations]] allows the payment to be lawfully pursued. Data may be retained upon a user's consent for marketing and value-added services. For both previous uses, the data subject must be informed why and for how long the data is being processed.

Subscribers have the right to non-itemised billing.&lt;ref&gt;Article 7&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the users must be able to opt out of calling-line identification.&lt;ref&gt;Article 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Where data relating to location of users or other traffic can be processed, Article 9 provides that this will only be permitted if such data is anonymised, where users have given consent, or for provision of value-added services. Like in the previous case, users must be informed beforehand of the character of information collected and have the option to opt out.&lt;ref&gt;Article 9(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unsolicited e-mail and other messages===
Article 13 prohibits the use of email addresses for marketing purposes.  The Directive establishes the [[Opt in email|opt-in]] regime, where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient. A natural or legal person who initially collects address data in the context of the sale of a product or service, has the right to use it for commercial purposes provided the customers have a prior opportunity to reject such communication where it was initially collected and subsequently. Member States have the obligation to ensure that unsolicited communication will be prohibited, except in circumstances given in Article 13. 

Two categories of emails (or communication in general) will also be excluded from the scope of the prohibition. The first is the exception for existing customer relationships and the second for marketing of similar products and services.&lt;ref&gt;Article 13(2)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The sending of unsolicited text messages, either in the form of SMS messages, push mail messages or any similar format designed for consumer portable devices (mobile phones, PDAs) also falls under the prohibition of Article 13.&lt;ref&gt;Recital 40, Preamble&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cookies===
The Directive provision applicable to [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] is Article 5(3). Recital 25 of the Preamble recognises the importance and usefulness of cookies for the functioning of modern Internet and directly relates Article 5(3) to them but Recital 24 also warns of the danger that such instruments may present to privacy. The change in the law does not affect all types of cookies; those that are deemed to be "strictly necessary for the delivery of a service requested by the user", such as for example, cookies that track the contents of a user's shopping cart on an [[online shopping]] service, are exempted.

The article is technology neutral, not naming any specific technological means which may be used to store data, but applies to any information that a website causes to be stored in a user's browser. This reflects the EU legislator's desire to leave the regime of the directive open to future technological developments.

The addressees of the obligation are Member States, who must ensure that the use of electronic communications networks to store information in a visitor's browser is only allowed if the user is provided with "clear and comprehensive information", in accordance with the [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data|Data Protection Directive]], about the purposes of the storage of, or access to, that information; and has given his or her consent. 

The regime so set-up can be described as [[Opt in e-mail|opt-in]], effectively meaning that the consumer must give his or her consent before cookies or any other form of data is stored in their browser. The UK Regulations allow for consent to be signified by future browser settings, which have yet to be introduced but which must be capable of presenting enough information so that a user can give their informed consent and indicating to a target website that consent has been obtained. Initial consent can be carried over into repeated content requests to a website. The Directive does not give any guidelines as to what may constitute an opt-out, but requires that cookies, other than those "strictly necessary for the delivery of a service requested by the user" are not to be placed without user consent.

==Criticism==
The directive has been criticised by the software firm [[Silktide]] who initially produced a range of tools for web developers who wanted to make sure they were not falling foul of the law, but the company now describes the efforts as "a tragic waste of time". Oliver Emberton, who owns Silktide, told the BBC that users who had tried to comply with the law were being penalised more than those who had opted to ignore it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19505835|publisher=BBC Media Centre|title=Web software firm taunts UK data regulator over cookies|date=6 September 2012|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silktide created a protest website to highlight the "ineffective" rules with a message to the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (the UK body tasked with enforcing the directive) "Dear ICO, sue us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dear ICO, Sue us|url=http://nocookielaw.com/|publisher=Silktide|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company taunts ICO: sue us over cookie law|url=http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/10652-company-taunts-ico-sue-us-over-cookie-law|publisher=Econsultancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Emberton, quoted on the BBC news website said "The ICO has the impossible job of policing an unworkable law. [...] The most frustrating thing for website owners has been trying to second guess what the law means, as it changes constantly. A lot of time and money has been wasted accomplishing very little. [...] The idea of this law is a noble one, it's just a shame it was drafted by a team of technically illiterate octogenarians who couldn't find a button on a mouse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22988221 |title=Internet cookie law catches out MPs including justice secretary |work=''BBC News''|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3444">'''''Quantum valebant''''' is a Latin phrase meaning "as much as they were worth." It is a common count at law very similar to ''[[quantum meruit]]''. The two legal actions differ only in that ''quantum meruit'' is used to recover the reasonable [[Value (economics)|value]] of [[Service (economics)|''services'']] rendered, while ''quantum valebant'' is used to recover the reasonable value of [[Good (economics)|''goods'']] sold and delivered.&lt;ref&gt;See 1 Corbin on Contracts (rev. ed.1993) § 1.18, at p. 53 (footnote omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; This count is considered a type of [[assumpsit]].&lt;ref&gt;See Joseph &amp; Thomas Chitty, 1 ''A Treatise on the Parties to Actions, and on Pleading'', p. 760 (1837); ''Harn v, Patterson'', 58 Okla. 694, 160 P. 924, 926 (1916).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case Law ==

The [[Supreme Court of California]] has held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although such an action is one at law, it is governed by principles of equity. It may be brought 'wherever one person has received money which belongs to another, and which "in equity and good conscience," or in other words, in justice and right, should be returned.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. The plaintiff's right to recover is governed by principles of equity, although the action is one at law.&lt;ref&gt;''Mains v. City Title Ins. Co.'', 34 Cal.2d 580, 586, 212 P.2d 873 (1949) (internal citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An illustration of a case in which ''quantum valebant'' was allowed is [http://www.gao.gov/assets/410/400664.pdf ''In re Monitor Prods. Co.''].&lt;ref&gt;Decisions of the U.S. Comptroller General (July 27, 1976), No. B-182437&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, the [[United States Navy]] had entered into a contract to buy 160 electronic oscillator units at a specified [[price]]. The Navy later decided that it wanted 40 more units. Monitor, the subcontractor, told the Navy's project engineer that it needed substantial price increase for the additional 40 units as well as reimbursement for [[cost overrun]]s which it was incurring in producing the initial 160 units; otherwise it would have to cease [[Production (economics)|production]]. No additional formal contract was signed, but the project went ahead and Monitor provided the 200 units. The Navy declined to pay any additional amount, although Monitor insisted that it was induced to incur the additional costs by a representative of the Navy (the project engineer), who appeared to have the authority to commit the Government.

The [[Comptroller General of the United States]] held that

&lt;blockquote&gt;the courts and our Office have recognized that in appropriate circumstances payment may be made for services rendered on a ''quantum meruit'' basis (the reasonable value of work or labor), or for goods furnished on a ''quantum valebat'' basis (the reasonable value of goods sold and delivered).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the ruling, the Navy ratified an agreement for the extra units and cost overrun. Therefore, "Monitor's claim may be paid to the extent that the value of the items furnished exceeds any compensation which Monitor may have received from" the prime contractor for the work.

}}'''''R v Rodgers''''', 2006 SCC 15, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 554, is a case decided by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on the constitutionality of the collection of blood samples from prisoners. The Court upheld the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] provision allowing for retroactive [[DNA]] samples of prisoners without notice.

==Background==
[[Dennis Rodgers]] was a convicted sex offender who was serving his sentence in an Ontario prison. Since Rodgers was sentenced before the enactment of the 1998 ''[[DNA Identification Act (Canada)|DNA Identification Act]]'', his blood sample was not taken upon sentencing to be placed in the national database. Under the section 487.055(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, the Crown applied for an [[ex parte]] application for the DNA sample. Rodgers challenged the application on the basis that the enabling Code provision violated the rights within [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

==Opinion of the Court==
In a four to three decision the Court upheld the Code provisions. [[Louise Charron|Justice Charron]], writing for the majority found that the state's interest in his personal information was sufficient to outweigh Rodger's [[right to privacy]]. She noted that the DNA sample is akin to a finger print and will only be used for identification purposes. She also found that the provision is procedurally fair and was a clear articulation of the legislature's intent.

Although the Red River Compact has provisions for how much water each state can use or store from the Red River Basin, the Commission is a means of working out issues and problems, and this has reduced the chances of litigation. In recent years, the  Commission has addressed problems of [[water quality]] and pollution, as well as questions of quantity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44647">'''Refusing to assist a [[police officer]]''', [[peace officer]] or other [[law enforcement officer]] is an offence in various jurisdictions around the world. Some jurisdictions use the terminology 'refusing to aid a police officer' or 'failure to aid a police officer'.

This principle originates from [[Norman England]], where local [[Sheriffs]] in England would be the only peace officer in an area. He would summon assistance from locals in order to enforce the King's laws or to apprehend an offender.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyoflaw.co.uk/sheriffs-norman-times/&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently became part of the [[common law]] that all persons must assist a [[constable]] or peace officer when so requested. This still remains as one of the few common law offences which exist in England/Wales and some other states/countries.

==Canada==

[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Canada Criminal Code]] (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46)&lt;ref&gt;http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-129.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
See 129(b) for circumstances where it is a crime not to act in assistance of the police.

129 Every one who

(a) resists or wilfully obstructs a public officer or peace officer in the execution of his duty or any person lawfully acting in aid of such an officer,&lt;br&gt;
(b) omits, without reasonable excuse, to assist a public officer or peace officer in the execution of his duty in arresting a person or in preserving the peace, after having reasonable notice that he is required to do so, or&lt;br&gt;
(c) resists or wilfully obstructs any person in the lawful execution of a process against lands or goods or in making a lawful distress or seizure,

is guilty of

(d) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or &lt;br&gt;
(e) an offence punishable on summary conviction.

If a person, without reasonable excuse, neglects or refuses to assist a customs officer upon proper demand under paragraph (2), such person is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of not more than $1,000.
(b) Any person other than an officer or employee of the United States who renders assistance in good faith upon the request of a customs officer shall not be held liable for any civil damages as a result of the rendering of such assistance if the assisting person acts as an ordinary, reasonably prudent person would have acted under the same or similar circumstances.

{{Administrative law}}
In [[administrative law]], '''rule-making''' is the process that [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent]] [[Government agency|agencies]] use to create, or ''promulgate'', [[regulation]]s. In general,  [[legislature]]s first set broad [[Public policy|policy mandates]] by passing [[statute]]s, then agencies create more detailed [[regulation]]s through ''rulemaking''.

By bringing detailed [[science|scientific]] and other types of expertise to bear on policy, the rulemaking process has been the means by which some of the most far-reaching [[government]] regulations of the 20th century have been created. For example, science-based regulations are critical to modern programs for [[environmental protection]], [[food safety]], and [[Worker safety and health|workplace safety]].  However, the growth in regulations has fueled criticism that the rulemaking process reduces the [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and [[accountability]] of [[democracy|democratic]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Schoenbrod |first= David | editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |title= Delegation  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n74 |isbn= 978-1412965804 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages= 117–18 |quote=...[L]egislators can claim credit for the expected benefits..., but shift blame to the agency for the costs and disappointed expectations ....|ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Legislatures rely on rulemaking to add more detailed scientific, economic, or industry expertise to a policy—fleshing out the broader mandates of authorizing legislation.  For example, typically a legislature would pass a law mandating the establishment of safe drinking water standards, and then assign an agency to develop the list of contaminants and safe levels through rulemaking.

The rise of the rulemaking process itself is a matter of political controversy. Many find that obscure and complex rulemaking tends to undercut the [[democracy|democratic]] ideal of a government that is [[Transparency (humanities)|closely watched by]] and [[accountability|accountable]] to its citizens.

==Purposes==
Although executive agencies are usually charged with executing, not promulgating a regulatory scheme, the breadth and depth of regulation today renders it difficult, if not impossible, for legislatures to specify the details of modern regulatory schemes.  As a result, the specification of these details are mostly delegated to agencies for rulemaking.

Common purposes of rulemaking include:
* ''Adding scientific expertise.''  For example, in the U.S., the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] outlaws the sale of adulterated or impure drugs. The act requires that the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] promulgate regulations establishing which laboratory tests to use to test the purity of each drug.
* ''Adding implementation detail.''  Legislation on automobile fuel efficiency, for example, often delegates the development of the actual engine tests used to calculate 'city mileage' and 'highway mileage'.
* ''Adding industry expertise.''  The [[United States|U.S.]] [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] and [[Clean Water Act]] require the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to determine the appropriate emissions control technologies on an industry-by-industry basis.
* ''Adding flexibility.''  More detailed regulations allow for more nuanced approaches to various conditions than a single legislative standard could.  Moreover, regulations tend to be more easily changed as new data or technologies emerge.
* ''Finding compromise.''  In some cases, a divided legislature can reach an agreement on a compromise legislative standard, while each side holds out hope that the implementing regulations will be more favorable to its cause.

==The rulemaking process==
Rulemaking processes are generally designed to ensure that
* The public is informed of ''proposed rules'' before they take effect;
* The public can comment on the proposed rules and provide additional data to the agency;
* The public can access the ''rulemaking record'' and analyze the data and analysis behind a proposed rule;
* The agency analyzes and responds to the public's comments;
* The agency creates a permanent record of its analysis and the process;
* The agency's actions can be reviewed by a judge or others to ensure the correct process was followed.

For example, a typical U.S. federal rulemaking under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]], 5 U.S.C.§551, ''et seq.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = 5 U.S.C. §551, ''et seq.''
  | url=http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/Courses/study_aids/adlaw/index.htm
  | accessdate = 2008-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; would contain these steps:
* '''Legislation'''.  The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passes a law, containing an [[Organic statute (United States)|organic statute]] that creates a new [[government agency|administrative agency]], and that outlines general goals the agency is to pursue through its rulemaking.  Similarly, Congress may prescribe such goals and rulemaking duties to a pre-existing agency.
* '''Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking'''.  This optional step entails publishing the agency's initial analysis of the subject matter, often asking for early public input on key issues.  Any data or communications regarding the upcoming rule would be made available to the public for review.  Occasionally, a board of potentially affected parties is comprised to do give-and-take bargaining over rulemaking subject-matter which would otherwise result in deadlocked opposition by an interested party.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web
  | title =See ''Administrative Procedure Act'', 5 U.S.C. 561, ''et. seq.''
  | url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title5/parti_chapter5_subchapteriii_.html 
  | accessdate = 2008-06-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080410191407/http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title5/parti_chapter5_subchapteriii_.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is commonly called "[[negotiated rulemaking]]",&lt;ref name=APA/&gt; and results in more custom-tailored proposed rule.
* '''Proposed Rule'''.  In this step, the agency publishes the actual proposed regulatory language in the [[Federal Register]]; in which a discussion of the justification and analysis behind the rule is printed, as well as the agency's response to any public comment on the advance notice.
* '''Public comment'''.  Once a proposed rule is published in the Federal Register, a public comment period begins, allowing the public to submit written comments to the agency. Most agencies are required to respond to every issue raised in the comments.  Depending on the complexity of the rule, comment periods may last for 30 to even 180 days.
* '''Final Rule.''' Usually, the proposed rule becomes the final rule with some minor modifications.  In this step, the agency publishes a full response to issues raised by public comments and an updated analysis and justification for the rule, including an analysis of any new data submitted by the public.  In some cases, the agency may publish a second draft proposed rule, especially if the new draft is so different from the proposed rule that it raises new issues that have not been submitted to public comment.  This again appears in the [[Federal Register]], and if no further steps are taken by the public or interested parties, is codified into the [[Code of Federal Regulations]].
* '''[[Judicial review]]'''.  In some cases, members of the public or regulated parties file a lawsuit alleging that the rulemaking is improper.  While courts generally offer significant deference to the agency's technical expertise, they do review closely whether the regulation exceeds the rulemaking authority granted by the authorizing legislation and whether the agency properly followed the process for public notice and comment.
* '''Effective date'''.  Except in extraordinary circumstances, the rule does not become effective for some time after its initial publication to allow regulated parties to come into compliance.  Some rules provide several years for compliance.
* '''"Hybrid" rulemaking'''. Not a legal term of art, but describes the kind of rulemaking performed by agencies that is somewhere between formal (with a hearing and record) and informal (with the notice and comment procedures described above).  Hybrid rulemaking generally subsumes procedural aspects reserved for adjudication, such as a formal hearing in which interested parties are sworn and subject to cross examination.  The statutory construction of the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]], as well as the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court's]] ruling in [[Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.|''Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v.Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.'']],&lt;ref&gt;''See''[http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cases/adlaw/vermont-yankee.htm ''Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc'',  435 U.S. 519 (1978)] from [http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/index.htm Louisiana State University – Medical &amp; Public Health Law site]&lt;/ref&gt; make hybrid-rulemaking proper only when specifically provided for by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]].

In the United States  when an agency publishes a final rule generally the rule is effective no less than thirty days after the date of publication in the Federal Register.  If the agency wants to make the rule effective sooner, it must cite "good cause" (persuasive reasons) as to why this is in the public interest. 

Significant rules (defined by Executive Order 12866) and major rules (defined by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act ) are required to have a 60 day delayed effective date. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to the Rulemaking Process|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/uploads/2011/01/the_rulemaking_process.pdf|website=federalregister.gov|publisher=Office of the Federal Register|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules for Rulemaking==
Most modern rulemaking authorities have a [[common law]] tradition or a specific basic law that essentially regulates the regulators, subjecting the rulemaking process to standards of [[due process]], transparency, and [[public participation]].
* In the [[United States]], the governing law for federal rulemaking is the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act of 1946]].  Separate states often have parallel systems.
* [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries use a mix of [[common law]] and similar [[statute]] law.
* The [[European Commission]] has recently developed new standards pursuant to ideas laid out in a 'Whitepaper on governance.' This effort was undertaken after the Irish ‘no’ vote in 2001, addressing concerns that the public perceived the Commission’s legislative and rulemaking processes as too removed from citizen input.

==Use in private industry==
Private rulemaking bodies, such as the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]], [[Java Community Process]], and other technical communities, have adopted similar principles and frameworks to ensure fairness, transparency and thoroughness. While the mechanics vary, these efforts follow the same pattern of an open rulemaking record, public publication of proposals, and an [[request for comments|opportunity for public comment]] on those proposals before they are finalized.

==Rulemaking apparatus==
Public participation requires some official method for the agency to communicate to the public.  Generally, agencies produce an official ''[[gazette]],'' or periodical for publishing all rulemaking notice, such as the [[Federal Register]].  Once a rule is final, the language of the rule itself (not the supporting analysis or data) is ''[[Codification (law)|codified]]'' in the official body of regulations, such as the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR).

In essence, the accountability of the rulemaking system assumes that the public actually does take note of all of the notices in the Federal Register, which can run over a hundred pages per day.  In practice, many industry or public advocacy lobbyists and lawyers monitor the Federal Register Table of Contents every day by email on behalf of their constituents or clients.

Public comments are the heart of the public’s ability to participate in the rulemaking process.  The agency rulemaking is usually required to consider and publish a written response to all comments.  Although high-profile rulemakings may include public hearings, most rulemakings are simply noticed in the Federal Register with a call for written comments by a set deadline.

Holding agencies accountable for objective, fact-based rulemaking requires maintaining a formal record of the facts and analysis behind the rule. Agencies must assemble and make public a ''rulemaking record'' that includes all information considered as part of the rulemaking process. 

These records can be enormous and can easily fill scores to hundreds of boxes.  Interested parties generally must travel to an agency repository to inspect and copy this record. In the United States the Federal government is moving toward posting rulemaking dockets on-line at [http://www.regulations.gov www.regulations.gov].  Supporting documentation for 37% of new rulemakings was available on-line as of August 2006.  By August 2007 it was available for 80% of new rulemakings.  Interested parties frequently comb through the agency’s own data to find flaws in the agency’s reasoning.  Also, interested parties’ comments on the rule then become part of this record.

==Rulemaking and the courts==
In the U.S., interested parties can sue to have a judge review the rulemaking process once the rule is finalized. Interested parties frequently sue the rulemaking agency, asking the court to order the agency to reconsider. For example, [[Environmentalism|environmental groups]] may sue, claiming that the rule is too lax on industry; or  [[Trade association|industry groups]] may sue, claiming that the rule is too onerous.

Traditionally, courts are reluctant to step into the shoes of the technical experts and re-open the decisions made in the agency’s detailed analysis. However, courts do review whether a rulemaking meets the standards for the rulemaking process. The basis of this review by the courts may be limited to certain questions of [[Equity (law)|fairness]] or the procedures that ensure that both sides of a dispute are treated equally before any [[decision making]] occurs or that the decision is not [[patently unreasonable]] (under Canadian law) or [[Wednesbury unreasonableness]] (under British law) or similar doctrines described below.

These powers of review of administrative decision, while often governed by statute, were originally developed out of the royal [[prerogative writ]]s of [[English law]] such as the writ of [[mandamus]] and the writ of [[certiorari]].

Thus, it is not enough to simply claim that the rulemaking agency could have done a better job.  Instead, under U.S. administrative law, to ask the court to order changes in a rule, a party must argue that the rule is:

'''Arbitrary and capricious''' and/or '''unsupported by the record.''' Most frequently, objectors will argue that, even if the judge is not an expert, the judge can tell that there is an obvious gap in the agency’s data or analysis.  A court may intervene if it finds that there is no reasonable way that the agency could have drafted the rule, given the evidence in the rulemaking record.  A court may send a rule back to the agency for further analysis, generally leaving the agency to decide whether to change the rule to match the existing record or to amend the record to show how they arrived at the original rule. If a court does remand a rule back to the agency, it almost always involves an additional notice and public comment period.

'''Exceeds statutory authority.''' Frequently, opponents of a rule argue that it fails to follow the instructions of the authorizing legislation. Rules can be found to exceed statutory authority if they are too strict or too lax.  If a law instructs an agency to issue regulations to ban a chemical, but the agency issues a rule that instead sets levels for safe use—or vice versa—a court may order the agency to issue a new rule.

'''Bolt out of the blue.''' Occasionally, interested parties argue that the final rule contains provisions that were never vetted during the public comment period. A court may intervene if it finds that there was no way that the commenting public could have anticipated the new provisions and provided comment. If so, the new provisions are said to be, in a colorful legal phrase, a 'bolt out of the blue' rather than a reasonable course correction during the rulemaking process.  Frequently, agencies will vet several options during the proposed rule phase to allow for comment on the full spectrum of rules under consideration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2075">The '''Council of Lords''' or Sovet Gospod was, according to the traditional scholarship, the [[executive organ]] of the Novgorodian and Pskovian [[veche]]s.

==The Council of Lords in Novgorod the Great==
In Novgorod, the Council of Lords was said to have been chaired by the [[Archbishop of Novgorod]] and composed of the posadniks (the incumbent and retired posadniks), tysyatskys (incumbent and retired), and other important members of the boyarstvo.  It met, after 1433, in the Palace of Facets, part of the archiepiscopal palace in Novgorod built by [[Evfimy II (Archbishop of Novgorod)|Evfimy II]].&lt;ref&gt;For a brief review of the traditional literature, see Michael C. Paul, "The Iaroslavichi and the Novgorodian Veche: A Case Study on Princely Relations with the Veche," ''Russian History'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Valentin Yanin]] has argued that the Council of Lords was the real governing body in Novgorod and that it controlled the veche, which was merely a sham through which the common people were tricked into thinking they were participating in government.&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Ianin, ''Novgorodskie Posadniki'' (Moscow: Moscow State University, 1962; second edition Moscow: Yazyki Slavianskoi Kultury, 2003), 437; Idem, "The Archaeology of Novgorod," ''Scientific American'' 262, No. 2(Feb. 1990), 72-84.&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently though, Jonas Granberg has called into question the very existence of the Council of Lords, arguing that it is an invention of historians based on very sparse sources and much conjecture based on other governing bodies elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Granberg, “The Sovet Gospod of Novgorod, in Russian and German Sources,” ''Jahrbücher für Geschichte Osteuropas'' 47 (1998): 396-401.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Council of Lords In Pskov==
The [[Pskov Judicial Charter]] and other sources speak of "The Lords" but it is not clear if this is a formal body or a more general term like "the city fathers" or something to that effect.

== History ==
In late 2006 political scientist [[Kerstin Schnatz]] and cinematographer [[Isabel Huber]] began to research on uranium. They intended to do a documentary film focussing on the origins of nuclear power, especially the [[nuclear cycle]] and [[uranium mining]]. After having gathered a film crew of volunteers, the film was shot in Australia, France and Germany. In 2009 the international version of the documentary "Uranium - is it a country?" (53 min.) was released and nominated for the newcomer's award "Goldener Schlüssel" at [[Kasseler Dokumentarfilm- und Videofest]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="Dok-Fest Kassel 2009"&gt;
                      {{cite web
                      | url     = http://filmladen.de/dokfest_alt/alt/2009/programm-en/cview/269

                      }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film crew decided to distribute the documentary under an [[open licence]] model&lt;ref name="Uranium - is it a country? - Licence"&gt;
                      {{cite web
                      | url     = http://strahlendesklima.de/en/uranium/lizenz/

to spread the content. The film has been screened thousands of times all around the world due to its [[decentralised]] [[Film distributor|distribution]] coordinated by online networking activists.
It has been used heavily for political campaigning up to the [[German federal election]] in September 2009&lt;ref name="Screening Ludwigsburg"&gt;

In the summer of 2010 the film crew decided to found a [[non-profit organisation]] (Strahlendes Klima e.V.) to keep up the work on envirenmental issues.

== Activities ==

Strahlendes Klima e.V. helps activists to organize film screenings and debates on environmental issues.
They organise workshops for schools and non-profits and release educational films and media on a regular basis. In 2010 "At Eyelevel" their film about [[indigenous peoples]] facing the problems of uranium mining was released.

In 2011 [[Goethe Institut]]-Shanghai invited the organisation to visit [[China]]. A short film treating [[renewable energies]] in China is expected to be released in mid-2012.&lt;ref name="Projekt China"&gt;
                      {{cite web
                      | url     = http://china.strahlendesklima.de

                      }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They recently started the shooting of a new feature-length documentary on sustainable waste strategies, which will be available licensed under [[creative commons]] by 2013.

The '''Sullivan principles''' are the names of two corporate [[code of conduct|codes of conduct]], developed by the African-American preacher Rev. [[Leon Sullivan]], promoting [[corporate social responsibility]]:
* The original '''Sullivan principles''' were developed in 1977 to apply economic pressure on South Africa in protest of its [[Apartheid in South Africa|system of apartheid]].&lt;ref name=Sullivan1977&gt;Rev. Leon Sullivan. [http://muweb.marshall.edu/revleonsullivan/indexf.htm The Sullivan Principles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107010413/http://muweb.marshall.edu/revleonsullivan/indexf.htm |date=7 January 2010 }}, The Rev. Leon Sullivan Website. Accessed 5 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The principles eventually gained wide adoption among United States–based corporations.
*:For more, see ''[[#The Sullivan principles]]'' below.
* The new '''global Sullivan principles''' were jointly unveiled in 1999 by Rev. Sullivan and [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]].&lt;ref name=NewPrinciples&gt;[http://www.thesullivanfoundation.org/about/global_sullivan_principles The Global Sullivan Principles of Social Responsibility] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721080435/http://www.thesullivanfoundation.org/about/global_sullivan_principles |date=21 July 2011 }} Sullivan. 2010. Last accessed 15 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The new and expanded corporate code of conduct, as opposed to the originals' specific focus on South African apartheid, were designed to increase the active participation of corporations in the advancement of human rights and [[social justice]] at the international level.

==The Sullivan principles==
{{International opposition to Apartheid}}
In 1977, Rev. [[Leon Sullivan]], an African-American minister, was a member of the board of [[General Motors]].&lt;ref name=Sullivan1977/&gt; At the time, General Motors was one of the largest corporations in the United States. General Motors also happened to be the largest employer of blacks in South Africa, a country which was pursuing a harsh program of state-sanctioned racial segregation and discrimination targeted primarily at the country's black population.&lt;ref name=Sullivan1977/&gt;

Sullivan, looking back on his anti-Apartheid efforts, recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Starting with the work place, I tightened the screws step by step and raised the bar step by step. Eventually I got to the point where I said that companies must practice corporate civil disobedience against the laws and I threatened South Africa and said in two years Mandela must be freed, apartheid must end, and blacks must vote or else I'll bring every American company I can out of South Africa.&lt;ref name=Sullivan1977/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The original principles===
The Sullivan principles, introduced in 1977 with one addition in 1984, consisted of seven requirements a corporation was to demand for its employees as a condition for doing business.  In general, the principles demanded the equal treatment of employees regardless of their race both within and outside of the workplace, demands which directly conflicted with the official South African policies of racial segregation and unequal rights.

The principles read:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| style="background:#FAFAFA; text-align:left;" |
&lt;center&gt;'''The Sullivan principles'''&lt;ref name=Sullivan1977/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

# Non-segregation of the races in all eating, comfort, and work facilities.
# Equal and fair employment practices for all employees.
# Equal pay for all employees doing equal or comparable work for the same period of time.
# Initiation of and development of training programs that will prepare, in substantial numbers, blacks and other nonwhites for supervisory, administrative, clerical, and technical jobs.
# Increasing the number of blacks and other nonwhites in management and supervisory positions.
# Improving the quality of life for blacks and other nonwhites outside the work environment in such areas as housing, transportation, school, recreation, and health facilities.
# Working to eliminate laws and customs that impede social, economic, and political justice. ''(added in 1984)''
|}

===Mixed success===
The Sullivan principles were celebrated when introduced and gained wide use in the United States, particularly during the [[Disinvestment from South Africa|disinvestment campaign]] of the 1980s. Before the end of South Africa's apartheid era, the principles were formally adopted by more than 125 US corporations that had operations in South Africa. Of those companies that formally adopted the principles, at least 100 completely withdrew their existing operations from South Africa.&lt;ref name=Sullivan1977/&gt;

However, as South Africa's system of apartheid persisted relatively unchanged from the 1970s into the late 1980s, Sullivan "abandoned [his principles] as not going far enough" complaining that the principles by themselves were not enough to pressure a South African government steadfast in its refusal to yield to change.&lt;ref name=ChristianityToday2001&gt;[http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2001/aprilweb-only/4-30-44.0.html Leon Sullivan Dies at 78]. Christianity Today. 1 April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The global Sullivan principles==
In 1999, more than 20 years after the adoption of the original Sullivan Principles and six years after the end of apartheid, the Rev. Leon Sullivan and [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] together unveiled the new "Global Sullivan Principles".&lt;ref name=NewPrinciples/&gt;

The overarching objective of these principles, according to Leon Sullivan, is "to support economic, social and political justice by companies where they do business," including respect for human rights and equal work opportunities for all peoples.&lt;ref name=NewPrinciples/&gt;

===The new principles===
In general, the expanded corporate code of conduct requires adopting multinational companies to be a full participant in the advancement of human rights and social justice internationally.&lt;ref name=NewPrinciples/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChristianityToday2001/&gt;

The new principles read:
{| class="wikitable" style="width:80%;"
|-
| style="background:#FAFAFA; text-align:left;" |
&lt;center&gt;'''The Global Sullivan Principles'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesullivanfoundation.org/gsp/endorsers/charter/default.asp Global Sullivan Principle Endorsers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105035029/http://www.thesullivanfoundation.org/gsp/endorsers/charter/default.asp |date=5 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

The Principles:
:As a company which endorses the Global Sullivan Principles we will respect the law, and as a responsible member of society we will apply these Principles with integrity consistent with the legitimate role of business. We will develop and implement company policies, procedures, training and internal reporting structures to ensure commitment to these principles throughout our organisation. We believe the application of these Principles will achieve greater tolerance and better understanding among peoples, and advance the culture of peace.
&lt;br/&gt;
Accordingly, we will:
# Express our support for universal human rights and, particularly, those of our employees, the communities within which we operate, and parties with whom we do business.
# Promote equal opportunity for our employees at all levels of the company with respect to issues such as color, race, gender, age, ethnicity or religious beliefs, and operate without unacceptable worker treatment such as the exploitation of children, physical punishment, female abuse, involuntary servitude, or other forms of abuse.
# Respect our employees' voluntary freedom of association.
# Compensate our employees to enable them to meet at least their basic needs and provide the opportunity to improve their skill and capability to raise their social and economic opportunities.
# Provide a safe and healthy workplace; protect human health and the environment; and promote sustainable development.
# Promote fair competition including respect for intellectual and other property rights, and not offer, pay or accept bribes.
# Work with governments and communities in which we do business to improve the quality of life in those communities – their educational, cultural, economic and social well-being – and seek to provide training and opportunities for workers from disadvantaged backgrounds.
# Promote the application of these principles by those with whom we do business.
&lt;br/&gt;
We will be transparent in our implementation of these principles and provide information which
demonstrates publicly our commitment to them.

===''The Purge'' (2013)===
{{main|The Purge (2013 film)}}
'''''The Purge''''' stars [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Lena Headey]], [[Max Burkholder]], [[Adelaide Kane]], [[Edwin Hodge]], [[Tony Oller]], [[Rhys Wakefield]] and [[Arija Bareikis]].

An affluent [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood is home to the Sandin family. On Purge night 2022, the family becomes a target of a masked gang of young criminals due to their actions in helping a wounded stranger being targeted by Purgers to take shelter in their home. The sadistic gang leader unmasks himself to threaten the family via the cameras that they would be murdered if they don't surrender the man within an hour. The stranger later helps the Sandins when the purging gang and the hateful neighbors invade the household and attempt to kill them.

Despite mixed reviews, the film grossed $89.3 million during its run, far surpassing its $3 million budget. The film was turned into a [[Halloween Horror Nights#Scare zones|scare zone]] in 2014 for [[Universal Parks &amp; Resorts]] annual [[Halloween Horror Nights]] due to its success.

===''The Purge: Anarchy'' (2014)===
{{main|The Purge: Anarchy}}
'''''The Purge: Anarchy''''', released worldwide on July 18, 2014,&lt;ref name="Release"&gt;{{cite news |title=Universal Re-Slots ''The Purge: Anarchy'' |url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/02/universal-re-slots-the-purge-anarchy |accessdate=1 March 2014 |newspaper=Deadline.com |date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; stars [[Frank Grillo]], [[Carmen Ejogo]], [[Zach Gilford]], [[Kiele Sanchez]], [[Zoë Soul]] and [[Michael K. Williams]] while [[Edwin Hodge]] reprises his role of "The Stranger" from the first movie.&lt;ref name="Art"&gt;{{cite news |title=''The Purge 2'' Promo Art |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/the-purge-2-promo-art |accessdate=2 January 2014 |newspaper=MovieWeb.com |date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the first Purge film, which was set entirely in one house during the carnage, ''Anarchy'' takes viewers out to the [[Los Angeles area]] and shows more of what happens to the surroundings during the Purge.

Off-duty [[Los Angeles Police Department]] sergeant Leo Barnes purges to avenge his son's death and becomes the protector of a married couple whose car breaks down on the Purge's commencement and a working-class mother and daughter who are kidnapped from their home. The wounded stranger from the first film is the partner of Carmelo Johns, leader of an anti-Purge resistance group that hacks into TV programs to broadcast messages challenging the system, stating that the Purge does not cleanse aggression, but rather eliminates the poor.

The film was met with generally mixed reviews, though many critics agreed it was a large improvement over the first film, and was a box office success, grossing $111.9 million compared to its $9 million budget.

LAPD sergeant Leo Barnes is the chief of security for [[U.S. Senator]] and leading U.S. presidential candidate Charlie Roan, who vows to end the Purge, having witnessed the death of her family 18 years ago, during the events of the first film. In a bid to prevent this from happening, The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) takes the unprecedented step of abolishing the protection afforded to government officials of ranking 10, allowing the U.S. public to target all government officials for the first time since the purge's creation. After a betrayal within the government targets her for death minutes after the Purge's commencement, Barnes must protect Roan while on the run for safety until they meet and form an alliance with some of her supporters; two shopkeepers, an EMT, and an anti-Purge rebel team headed by the wounded Stranger from the first two films, whose real name is Dante Bishop. The group are also aided by the notorious [[Crips (gang)|Crips gang]] to avoid an NFFA-loyal neo-Nazi/white supremacist paramilitary team from capturing the senator. Meanwhile, the NFFA candidate and Roan's rival, Minister Edwidge Owens, who has been set up as a candidate to maintain the status quo, leads the NFFA in committing more acts of violence during Purge night as rebels try to protect more citizens.

In September 2016, James DeMonaco, who wrote and directed every film in the series thus far, stated that the fourth film would be a prequel to the trilogy.

{{main|The Purge (TV series)}}
A television series about the formation of the Purge is also hinted by DeMonaco. The series would possibly deal with how the New Founding Fathers were voted to office after overthrowing the U.S. Government during an economic collapse and social unrest and how they came up with the idea of the Purge. In May 2017, it was reported that [[Syfy]] and [[USA Network]] will premiere the series in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=‘Purge’: Premise Of Companion TV Series Revealed|url=http://deadline.com/2017/05/purge-tv-series-premise-usa-network-syfy-blumhouse-1202093752/|date=15 May 2017|website=Deadline|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 26, 2018, it was announced that [[Gabriel Chavarria]] and Jessica Garza were cast as the leads in the upcoming series. Chavarria will portray Miguel, a US Marine who returns home on Purge Night after receiving a cryptic message from his sister, Penelope portrayed by Garza belonging to a Purge worshipping cult and has pledged to become a sacrifice at the will of their charismatic leader forcing Miguel to face the senseless violence on the streets alone in order to protect those he loves most – his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/02/the-purge-gabriel-chavarria-jessica-garza-cast-usa-network-syfy-series-1202303556/|title=‘The Purge’: Gabriel Chavarria &amp; Jessica Garza To Star In TV Series For USA &amp; Syfy|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|publisher=Deadline|date=February 26, 2018|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series premiered on September 4, 2018.

==Plot prologue==
In 2014, following an economic collapse and rising social unrest, a political organization named "The New Founding Fathers of America" (NFFA) is formed, overthrows the government, and is voted into office. The organization establishes a new totalitarian government and a police state. In 2016, the NFFA devises a plan to help stabilize American society and later in 2017, the 28th Amendment to the [[United States Constitution|U.S Constitution]] is ratified. This amendment establishes a 12-hour event known as "The Purge" which would take place from 7:00 in the evening of March 21 to 7:00 in the morning of March 22, wherein all crime including murder becomes legal. Before the Purge begins, the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] is activated with rules and a prayer saying "Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn" before ending with "May God be with you all".

The rules for the annual Purge are as follows:
* Sirens blare throughout the land to signal the start and end of The Purge.
* All police, fire, and medical emergency services remain unavailable or suspended for the twelve-hour Purge.
* Government officials of ranking 10 or higher are granted immunity (revoked in ''Election Year'' to legalize the murder of a political opponent).
* Weapons of "Class 4" and below are permitted for use while "Class 5" weaponry (explosive devices such as grenades, rocket launchers, bazookas, etc., weapons of mass destruction, and viral/biological and chemical agents) is prohibited.
* Public hanging is the penalty for violators of any rules.

Below is how the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] announces the Purge' commencement in the first two films:

{{cquote|''This is not a test.''
''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''
''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''
''Government officials of ranking 10 have been granted immunity from the Purge and shall not be harmed.''
''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''
''Police, fire, and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 a.m., when The Purge concludes.''
''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''
''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}

In ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]'' (taking place 20 years after the establishment of The Purge), the rule granting immunity to ranking 10 officials is revoked by the NFFA in order to assassinate Roan, a lawyer-turned-senator who has achieved parity in the polls with the NFFA candidate. This was done to prevent her from overturning the 28th Amendment. The line "''And for the first time since its inception, no one has been granted special immunity from the Purge. No citizen or group will be exempt''" was added to the emergency broadcast in this film.

The final Purge's commencement is announced on the Emergency Broadcast System as follows:

{{cquote|''This is not a test.''
''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge, sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''
''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''
''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''
''Police, fire and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 am.''
''And, for the first time since its inception, no one has been granted special immunity from the Purge. No citizen or group will be exempt''
''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''
''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}

Within the film series, the Purge has resulted in crime and unemployment rates plummeting to 1% and a strong economy. Although it is thought to be used as an act of catharsis for the U.S. populace, it is actually used as a method of artificial [[Human population planning|population control]], as the unemployed poor in slum neighborhoods as well as some working-class people are usually the main targets; in ''Election Year'', a character notes that sneaking up on a black man on Purge night is a particularly foolish action, suggesting that black people are used to being targets on this night.

Trop, ''The Evolution of the Totality of the Circumstances Test for Willful Infringement'', 27 IDEA 241, 250 (1987) (discussing the use of totality tests to determine whether a patent was willfully infringed upon) with David Allen Peterson, ''Criminal Procedure: Totality of the Circumstances Test for Determining Probable Cause Applied to Informer's Tips'', 23 {{smallcaps|Washburn L.J.}} 437, 451 (1984) (discussing the use of totality tests "for determining probable cause based upon an informer's tip").&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Criminal law of the United States|United States criminal law]], a determination about [[reasonable suspicion]] or [[probable cause]] is based on a consideration of the totality of the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Kit Kinports, [https://www.pennlawreview.com/online/163-U-Pa-L-Rev-Online-75.pdf ''Probable Cause and Reasonable Suspicion: Totality Tests or Rigid Rules?''] 163 {{smallcaps|U.

Gates'', the Supreme Court has emphasized that the Fourth Amendment’s suspicion requirements — the probable cause required to arrest and search, the reasonable suspicion needed to stop and frisk — are totality-of-the-circumstances tests.").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Cathy E. Moore described the totality of the circumstances test as a "balancing approach" rather than a strict application of "analytical and evidentiary rules",&lt;ref&gt;Cathy E. Moore, ''Fourth Amendment — Totality of the Circumstances Approach to Probable Cause Based on Informant's Tips'', 74 {{smallcaps|J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology}} 1249, 1255 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Coenen wrote that a totality of the circumstances test is the "antithesis" of an "inflexible checklist".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Coenen, [http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/CoenenPDF_bmp8cxs3.pdf ''Rules Against Rulification''], 124 {{smallcaps|Yale L.J.}} 644, 647 (2014) (internal quotations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Kit Kinports has described the totality of the circumstances test as an analytical framework where decision makers are not bound by "rigid" rules, but instead are free to consider a range of evidence when making decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Kit Kinports, [https://www.pennlawreview.com/online/163-U-Pa-L-Rev-Online-75.pdf ''Probable Cause and Reasonable Suspicion: Totality Tests or Rigid Rules?''] 163 {{smallcaps|U. Pa. L. Rev.}} 75, 75 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; John Barker Waite also contrasted the totality of the circumstances test against rigid rules; he wrote that a judge's determination about a defendant's guilt will always be based on their reactions "to the totality of the circumstances", and the basis for such determinations cannot be "reduced to rule".&lt;ref&gt;John Barker Waite, ''Law of Arrest'' , 24 {{smallcaps|Tex. L. Rev.}} 279, 306 (1945–1946) ("What constitutes reasonable ground for a peace officer, or a private person, to believe that a felony has been committed by the arrestee has never been reduced to rule, and could not be. Whether such a belief is or is not reasonable depends upon the reaction of the particular judge who makes the decision to the totality of the circumstances.").&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As early as 1937, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that a totality test should be used to determine whether an individual qualifies as a "farmer" under United States bankruptcy law.&lt;ref&gt;''First Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Bridgeport, Conn. v. Beach'', {{ussc|volume=301|page=435|pin=439|year=1937}} ("In every case the totality of the facts is to be considered and appraised.").&lt;/ref&gt; In its 1983 decision in ''[[Illinois v. Gates]]'', the Supreme Court held that the totality of the circumstances test should be used to assess whether an anonymous tip is sufficient to provide probable cause.&lt;ref&gt;Cathy E. Moore, ''Fourth Amendment — Totality of the Circumstances Approach to Probable Cause Based on Informant's Tips'', 74 {{smallcaps|J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology}} 1249, 1249 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for a majority of the Court, [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] explained that a totality test was superior to a bright line rule because [[magistrate]]s would not be "restricted in their authority to make probable cause determinations".&lt;ref&gt;''Gates'', 462 U.S. at 420.&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2013 ruling in ''[[Florida v. Harris]]'', the Supreme Court affirmed that "lower court judges must reject rigid rules, bright-line
tests, and mechanistic inquiries in favor of a more flexible, all-things-considered approach."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Coenen, [http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/CoenenPDF_bmp8cxs3.pdf ''Rules Against Rulification''], 124 {{smallcaps|Yale L.J.}} 644, 647 (2014) (internal quotations omitted) (citing ''Florida v. Harris'', 133 S. Ct. 1050, 1055–56 (2013)).&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars have suggested that the Supreme Court's recent rulings in ''[[Florida v. Harris]]'' and ''[[Prado Navarette v. California]]'' represent a departure from the Court's prior totality test jurisprudence by introducing "drug-dog and drunk-driving exceptions to the totality-of-the-circumstances approach."&lt;ref&gt;Kit Kinports, [https://www.pennlawreview.com/online/163-U-Pa-L-Rev-Online-75.pdf ''Probable Cause and Reasonable Suspicion: Totality Tests or Rigid Rules?''] 163 {{smallcaps|U.

Harris'' has the practical effect of adopting the sweeping rule that a positive alert by a certified or recently trained drug dog gives rise to probable cause. ''Navarette v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21404">'''Voltage optimisation''' is a term given to the systematic controlled reduction in the voltages received by an energy consumer to reduce energy use, power demand and reactive power demand.  While some voltage 'optimisation' devices have a fixed  voltage adjustment, others electronically regulate the voltage automatically.

Voltage optimisation systems are typically installed in series with the mains electrical supply to a building, allowing all its electrical equipment to benefit from an optimised supply.

==Background==
Voltage optimisation is an electrical energy saving technique which is mainly installed in series with the mains electricity supply to provide a reduced supply voltage for the site's equipment. Typically, voltage optimisation can improve power quality by balancing phase voltages and filtering harmonics and transients from the supply, although not always. Voltage optimisers are essentially [[transformer]]s used to deliver power at a reduced voltage from the raw mains supply.

The term voltage optimisation is frequently misused, as the term implies some form of selective voltage reduction, which will improve the energy consumption within a building, whereas generally these units consists of a transformer within a box, offering no selectivity and dropping voltage on all supplies, whether this would offer a commercial benefit or not.  Some VO units have been installed on high frequency lighting circuits, offering little or no commercial benefit, therefore one must be careful when the term is used.

Most VO units are installed in commercial premises, in between the raw mains transformer and main low voltage distribution board. However, this provides for no selectivity and in electrical engineering terms is considered a poor solution. A full study should be undertaken by the facilities manager and VO company, to select which supplies could benefit the owner by reducing the voltage and which supplies would give no commercial benefit. This way the owner only purchases a VO of the correct size and not one that's for all supplies. Installing a VO unit to 'optimise' all supplies would give a longer return on investment, a higher capital outlay and makes little commercial sense.

=== United Kingdom ===

The declared low voltage electricity supply in the United Kingdom as per the Electrical Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations 2002, is now 230 V with a tolerance of +10% to -6%. This means that supply voltage can theoretically be anywhere between 216V and 253V depending on local conditions. However, the average voltage supplied from the national grid (in mainland UK) is 242V,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|  url=http://www.elexon.co.uk/documents/Participating_in_the_Market/Unmetered_Supplies_-_UMSUG/Draft_UMSUG_Minutes_November_v1.0.pdf | title=Elexon Unmetered Supplies User Group | date=2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to the nominal European voltage of 230 V. (The average supply voltage in Northern Ireland is around 239 V, and 235 V in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.voltageoptimisation.com/SiteVoltages.aspx | title=Measured site voltages in Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Older electrical equipment manufactured for the UK was rated at 240 V, and older equipment manufactured for Continental Europe was rated at 220 V (see [[Mains power around the world|Worldwide Mains Voltages]]). New equipment should be designed for 230 V. A mixture of equipment is likely to be found in older premises. All equipment placed on the market within the E.U. since voltage harmonisation in 1995 should operate satisfactorily at voltages within the range 230 V +/-10%. Equipment rated at 220 V should operate satisfactorily down to 200 V.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Effects of Reduced Voltage on the Operation and Efficiency of Electric Loads |last= Chen |first= M.S. |author2=R.R. Shoults |author3=J. Fitzer |publisher = EPRI, Arlington, University of Texas |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; By efficiently bringing supply voltages to the lower end of the statutory voltage range, voltage optimisation technology could yield average energy savings of around 13% {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

The higher the voltage the higher the power consumption in the case of a pure resistance load.  A reduction in voltage does not affect the energy used by the domestic appliances which use resistive loads except in devices such as kettles and toasters which will take longer to do their job due to atmospheric losses.  The main commercial benefit when installing VO units, is on inductive loads, like motors which run pumps, fans and the like.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} In the home, the potential energy saving can be up to 12% on electricity bills. A VO device will lower the voltage to the most efficient level to maximise the savings on electricity consumption, so you may notice certain things taking a little longer, such as a kettle may take a little longer to boil.&lt;ref name="Hood 2004"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hood|first=G.K.|title=The effects of voltage variation on the power consumption and energy cost of a domestic household|url=http://itee.uq.edu.au/~aupec/aupec04/papers/PaperID77.pdf|work=Paper presented to the Australasian Universities' Power Engineering Conference (AUPEC 2004)|publisher=School of Science and Engineering, University of Ballarat|accessdate=13 May 2011|authorlink=The effects of voltage variation on the power consumption and energy cost of a domestic household|date=26–29 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a common misconception that fridges and freezers do not provide savings through voltage optimisation because they are fitted with a thermostat. Fridges and freezers operate completely differently from resistive heating devices. If a resistive heating device is driven from a higher voltage the result is heat which is helpful in its intended purpose (heating). If a fridge or freezer is driven from a higher voltage the result is also heat however this is not helpful in its intended purpose (cooling). The compressor motor power output is reduced slightly by voltage optimisation so the fridge/freezer thermostat will keep the motor on a little longer however overall the effect is for the motor to run slightly longer at much lower losses. Tests at Manchester university showed a 10&amp;nbsp;°C reduction in motor temperature under voltage optimisation due to the reduced losses in the motor. {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Common power quality problems==

===Overvoltage===
[[Overvoltage]] refers to voltage higher than the voltage at which equipment is designed to operate most effectively. It can cause a reduction in equipment lifetime and increases in energy consumed with no improvement in performance. A commentary on the Wiring Regulations BS 7671 makes the following statements in relation to overvoltage:
“A 230 V rated lamp used at 240 will achieve only 55% of its rated life” (referring to [[incandescent lamp]]s) and
“A 230 V linear appliance used on a 240 V supply will take 4.3% more current and will consume almost 9% more energy.”

Various technologies can be used to avoid overvoltage, but it must be done so efficiently so that energy savings resulting from using the correct voltage are not offset by energy wasted within the device used to do so. Reliability is also important, and there are potential problems inherent in running full incoming power through electro-mechanical devices such as servo-controlled variable autotransformers.

[[Undervoltage]] refers to voltage lower than the voltage at which equipment is designed to operate most effectively. If the design of the VO does not take into consideration voltage drop over distance to remote power users, then this may lead to premature equipment failure, failure to start up, increased temperature in the case of motor windings and loss of service.

===Harmonics===
[[Harmonics (electrical power)|Harmonics]] are current and voltage waveforms at multiples of the fundamental frequency of the 50&amp;nbsp;Hz (or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) main supply. Harmonics are caused by non-linear loads, which include power supplies for computer equipment, variable speed drives, and discharge lighting. “Triplen” harmonics (odd multiples of the third harmonic) result when phase voltages are not balanced in a [[Three-phase|three phase]]  [[Electric power system|power systems]] and add in the neutral, causing wasteful currents to flow.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Harmonics and Power Quality| date=1998-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possible effects if the level of harmonics, known as [[total harmonic distortion]] becomes too high include damage to sensitive electronic equipment&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and reduction in the efficiency of the HV transformer.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE recommended practise for establishing transformer capability when supplying nonsinusoidal load currents ANSI/IEEE Standard C57.110–1986, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of electrical loads can be improved by attenuating harmonics at the supply, or by preventing their generation.  Some voltage optimisation devices also mitigate harmonics, reducing losses associated with harmonic content on the electrical system.

===Transients===
[[Transient (oscillation)|Transients]] are large, very brief and potentially destructive increases in voltage. Their causes include lightning strikes, switching of large electrical loads such as motors, transformers and electrical drives, and by switching between power generation sources to balance supply and demand. Although they typically only last thousandths or millionths of a second, transients can damage electronic systems causing data loss, degrading equipment components and shortening equipment life.  Some voltage optimisation devices include transient protection.

===Phase voltage imbalance===
Industrial and commercial sites are supplied with [[Three-phase electric power|3-phase electricity]]. Imbalance between the phases causes problems such as heating in motors and existing wiring, leading to wasteful energy consumption.&lt;ref name="Energy"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2007.03.023|last1=Faiz|first1=J|last2=Ebrahimpour|first2=H|title=Precise derating of three phase induction motors with unbalanced voltages |journal= Energy Conversion and Management |volume= 48 |pages= 2579–2586 |date=September 2007|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some voltage optimisation devices are able to improve balance on the building's electrical supply, reducing losses and improving the longevity of three phase induction motors.

===Power dips===
[[Power dips]] are reductions in voltage, mostly of short duration (&lt;300 ms) but sometimes longer. They may cause a number of problems with equipment, for example contactors and relays may drop out causing machinery to stop. There are a number of [[low voltage ride through]] techniques including Uninterruptible Power Supplies, the use of capacitors on low voltage DC control circuits, the use of capacitors on the DC bus of Variable Speed Drives. Care must be taken that Voltage Optimisation measures do not reduce the voltage to an extent that equipment is more vulnerable to power dips.

===Power factor and reactive power===
{{Main article|power factor}}
The [[power factor]] of an electrical supply is the ratio of the [[AC power|real power]] to the [[AC power|apparent power]] of the supply. It is the useful power used by the site divided by the total power that is drawn. The latter includes power that is unusable, so a power factor of 1 is desirable. A low power factor would mean that the electricity supplier would effectively supply more energy than the consumer’s bill would indicate, and suppliers are allowed to charge for low power factors.

[[AC power|Reactive power]] is the name given to unusable power. It does no work in the electrical system, but is used to charge capacitors or produce a magnetic field around the field of an inductor. Reactive power needs to be generated and distributed through a circuit to provide sufficient real power to enable processes to run.
Reactive power increases significantly with increasing voltage as the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]] of equipment increases. Correcting this with voltage optimisation will therefore lead to a reduction in reactive power and improvement in power factor.

==Effects on electrical loads==

A common misconception as far as Voltage Optimisation is concerned is to assume that a reduction in voltage will result in an increase in current and therefore constant power. Whilst this is true for certain fixed-power loads, most sites have a diversity of loads that will benefit to a greater or lesser extent with energy savings aggregating across a site as a whole.  The benefit to typical equipment at three phase sites is discussed below.

===Three phase motors===
Three phase induction motors are probably the most common type of three phase load and are used in a variety of equipment including refrigeration, pumps, air conditioning, conveyor drives as well as their more obvious applications. The de-rating effects of overvoltage and three phase imbalance on AC motors are well known.&lt;ref name="Energy"/&gt; Excessive overvoltage results in saturation of the iron core, wasting energy through eddy currents and increased hysteresis losses. Drawing excessive current results in excess heat output due to copper losses. The additional stress of overvoltage on motors will decrease motor lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal= Industry Applications Conference |title= Thirty-Second IAS Annual Meeting |volume= 1 |date=1997-10-05 |pages= 196–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avoiding overvoltage high enough to cause saturation does not reduce efficiency&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal= IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications |volume= 1A-8, No. 4 |date= July 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  so substantial energy savings can be made through reducing iron and copper losses. However, motors designed for the nominal voltage (e.g. 400 V) should be able to cope with normal variation in voltage within the supply limits(+/-10%) without saturation, so this is unlikely to be a significant problem.

Reducing voltage to an induction motor will slightly affect the motor speed as slip will increase, but speed is mainly a function of the supply frequency and the number of poles. Motor efficiency is optimum at reasonable load (typically 75%) and at the designed voltage, and will fall off slightly with small variations either side of this voltage. Larger variations affect efficiency more.

Very lightly loaded motors (&lt;25%) and small motors benefit most from reducing voltage.&lt;ref name="IEEE"/&gt;

For the case of motors driven by Variable Speed Drives, when the input voltage is reduced, there will be a proportionate reduction of the output voltage from the VSD and the motor will draw less current and eventually consume less power. However, if the motor is running on high load (&gt;80%), the reduction in voltage will result in reduced torque and motor will end up drawing more current and power.

===Lighting===
When lighting loads are in use for a high proportion of the time, energy savings on lighting equipment are extremely valuable. When voltage is reduced, incandescent lighting will see a large decrease in power drawn, a large decrease in light output and an increase in lifetime, as the previous extracts from the Electricians Guide illustrate. Since the decrease in light output will exceed the decrease in power drawn, the energy efficiency - [[luminous efficacy]] - of the lighting will drop.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osram.com/osram_com/Tools_%26_Services/Training_%26_Knowledge/Encyclopedia_of_Light/popups/pop_Incandescent_lamps.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other types of lighting can also benefit from improved power quality, including systems with resistive or reactive ballasts. Fluorescent &amp; discharge lighting is more efficient than incandescent lighting. Fluorescent  lighting with conventional magnetic ballasts will see a reduced power consumption, but also a reduced lumen output from the lamp. Fluorescent lamps on modern electronic ballasts will use approximately the same power and give the same light.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;

To provide the same wattage at the reduced voltage will require a greater current and increase cable losses. However, lighting controllers and ballasts are responsible for generating high levels of harmonic distortion, which can be filtered with some types of voltage optimiser, in addition reducing the need for lighting controllers.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;
A common concern is that some lighting will fail to strike at lower voltages. However, this should not occur since the aim of voltage optimisation is not simply to reduce the voltage as far as possible, but to bring it to the service level voltage at which it was designed to operate most efficiently.

===Heating===
Heaters will consume less power, but give less heat. Thermostatically controlled space or water heaters will consume less power while running, but will have to run for longer in each hour to produce the required output, resulting in no saving.

===Switched mode power supplies===
Switched mode power supplies will use the same power as before, but will draw a slightly greater current to achieve this, with slightly increased cable losses, and slight risk of the increased current tripping [[Miniature circuit breaker|MCBs]].

==Energy savings==
The energy savings achieved by Voltage Optimization are an aggregation of the improved efficiency of all equipment across a site in response to the improvements in the power quality problems outlined above. It possible technique for savings in energy consumption in certain circumstances.

Research in Taiwan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Chen |first1= Chao-Shun |last2= Chan |first2= Shun-Yu |year= 1987 |title= Effects of Voltage Reduction on Distribution Systems
|journal= Electric Power Systems Research |volume= 12 |issue= |pages= |url= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that, for an industrial supply, for voltage reduction upstream of the transformer, there is a 0.241% decrease of energy consumption when the voltage is decreased  by 1%, and an increase of 0.297% when the voltage is increased by 1%.  This assumed a mixture of loads including 7% fluorescent lighting, 0.5% incandescent lighting, 12.5% three phase air conditioners, 5% motors, 22.5% small 3-phase motors, 52.5% large 3-phase motors.

It is likely that a modern installation would have less opportunity: almost no incandescent lighting,  partly high-frequency fluorescent lighting (no saving), some variable speed drives (no saving),  higher motor efficiencies (so less waste to save). A northern  European installation would not have the large number of small single phase motors for air conditioning.

Energy saving is possible with older lighting, at the expense of lower light output, (e.g. incandescent or fluorescent and discharge lighting with inefficient ballast or control gear). Therefore, older commercial and office premises may save more than modern buildings or industrial sites. However modern lighting systems (typically LED) will save significantly more energy due to higher efficiency than energy saved on older lighting systems following installation of a voltage optimiser.

Obtaining energy savings with a voltage optimiser used with modern lighting systems is very questionable. Modern electronic switching controllers for LED or fluorescent lighting systems are designed to run the lights at optimal light output and longevity with high efficiency. Variations in supply voltage will therefore not make any difference to the overall energy use of these types of lights. However there exist types of low cost LED and fluorescent lamp controllers which reduce the voltage by shedding energy as heat (e.g. multiple LEDs in series with a series resistance). Varying the supply voltage would affect the energy used by these types of lights, but these type of lamps are generally low power and the light output would also be affected.

===Worked example===
A typical 100 Watt incandescent lamp has an efficiency of no more than 17.5 lumens per Watt (l/W) and will therefore produce 1750 lumens at its rated voltage. A typical modern LED lamp has an efficiency of about 150 lumens per Watt, and therefore requires no more than 12 Watts for the same light output. According to [[Lamp rerating]] formulae, reducing the voltage across an incandescent lamp by 10% reduces the power (and therefore energy) by about 16% and reduces the light output by about 31%.

Therefore, a voltage optimiser that reduces the voltage on an incandescent lamp by 10%, will reduce the energy by 16% and light output by 31%, producing only 1210 lumens and consuming 84 Watts. Changing the incandescent lamp to an LED lamp with similar light output would have reduce the consumption more effectively, down to 12 Watts. Furthermore, since the light output is reduced by so much, higher savings could be made by changing to a 75 Watt incandescent lamp without a voltage optimiser (1312.5 lumens assuming 17.5 l/W). The LED lamp could also be reduced in size to 8W, if only 1210 lumens is required.

'''''Winterbottom v Wright''''' (1842) [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1842/713.pdf 10 M&amp;W 109]&lt;ref&gt;(1842) 152 [[English Reports|ER]] 402.&lt;/ref&gt; was an important case in [[England and Wales|English]] [[common law]] responsible for constraining the law's stance on [[negligence]] in the 19th century.

==Facts==
The [[plaintiff]] Winterbottom had been [[contract]]ed by the [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster-General]] to drive a [[mail coach]] supplied by the Postmaster. The [[defendant]] Wright had been contracted by the Postmaster to [[Predictive maintenance|maintain]] the coach in a safe state. The coach collapsed while Winterbottom was driving and he was injured. He claimed that Wright had "negligently conducted himself, and so utterly disregarded his aforesaid contract and so wholly and negligently failed to perform his duty in this behalf."&lt;ref name="LnO"&gt;Lunney &amp; Oliphant (2003) pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Winterbottom v. Wright'', the court held that the plaintiff had no redress. The principle of ''Winterbottom'' meant that consumers who were injured by defective products in the 19th century had no legal action against the defective execution of a contract to which they were not expressly privy.{{Citation needed|date= October 2011}}

==Judgment==
In 1842, the law’s only recognition of "negligence" was in respect of a [[breach of contract]]. As the plaintiff was not in a [[contract]] with the defendant the court ruled in favour of the defendant on the basis of the doctrine of [[privity of contract]].&lt;ref name="LnO"/&gt;

Winterbottom sought to extend the ''[[ratio decidendi|ratio]]'' of the court in ''[[Langridge v Levy]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Langridge v Levy]]'' [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1837/156.pdf (1837) 2 M&amp;W 519]; (1837) 150 [[English Reports|ER]] 863.&lt;/ref&gt; but the court rejected this on the grounds that that case involved a gun whose safety had been [[misrepresentation|misrepresented]] by the vendor.&lt;ref name="LnO"/&gt;

The case was also possibly influenced by [[public policy (law)|public policy]]. If the plaintiff were able to sue “there would be unlimited actions” and the public utility of the Postmaster-General was such that allowing such actions would be undesirable for society.&lt;ref name="LnO"/&gt;

==Significance==
Though [[Master of the Rolls]] [[William Brett, 1st Viscount Esher|William Brett]] sought to establish a general principle of [[duty of care]] in ''[[Heaven v. Pender]]'' (1883), his judgment was at variance with the majority of the court. The privity argument was subsequently rejected in common law in the U.S. in ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'' (1916) and finally in England by the doctrine of the "neighbour principle" in ''[[Donoghue v. Stevenson]]'' (1932).  This evolution is explained in the article on [[common law#The common law evolves to meet changing social needs and improved understanding|common law]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7389">The '''Workplace Democracy Act''' is a proposed [[US labor law]], that has been sponsored by [[Bernie Sanders]] and re-introduced from 1992 to 2018. Among its different forms, it would have removed obstacles to employers making [[collective agreements]], established an impartial National Public Employment Relations Commission to support fair [[collective bargaining]], required that pensions plans are jointly managed by employee and employer representatives, changed the definition of an "employee" to ensure every person who works for other people has labor rights, repeal all [[Right-to-work law|"right to work" laws]]. 

The latest version of the Act in 2018 gathered endorsements from leading lawmakers in the Democratic Party, including [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] and [[Mark Pocan]].

==Background==
{{see also|US labor law}}
Given the long term decline in collective bargaining and the rise in inequality, a susbtantial number of employee representatives, Democratic politicians, labor unions, academics, judges and lawyers had been advocating the revision of the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]]. 

On 25 September 1992 [[Bernie Sanders]] introduced the Bill to the [[US House of Representatives]] with 2 cosponsors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/102/hr6041 HR 6041] (102nd), [[Charles Hayes (politician)|Charles Hayes]] [D-IL1] and [[Major Owens]] [D-NY12]&lt;/ref&gt; After the Bill failed, Sanders tried again in 1994, with one cosponsor.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. 5126 (103rd) with [[Major Owens]] [D-NY12]&lt;/ref&gt; On a third attempt in 1995 by Sanders, the Bill gathered 19 cosponsors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/104/hr1355 H.R. 1355] (104th) [[David Bonior]] [D-MI10] (joined Nov 13, 1995), [[Peter DeFazio]] [D-OR4], [[Lane Evans]] [D-IL17], [[Chaka Fattah]] [D-PA2], [[Bob Filner]] [D-CA50], [[Henry González]] [D-TX20], [[Luis Gutiérrez]] [D-IL4], [[William Lipinski]] [D-IL3] (joined Nov 13, 1995), [[Zoe Lofgren]] [D-CA16], [[Matthew Martínez]] [D-CA31], [[Jerrold Nadler]] [D-NY8], [[Eleanor Norton]] [D-DC0], [[Major Owens]] [D-NY11], [[Donald M. Payne|Donald Payne]] [D-NJ10] , [[Esteban Torres]] [D-CA34], [[Nydia Velázquez]] [D-NY12], [[Melvin Watt]] [D-NC12] , [[Lynn Woolsey]] [D-CA6], [[Marcy Kaptur]] [D-OH9] (joined Apr 15, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Still the Bill stalled. It was reintroduced in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;HR 1355 (104th)[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/105/hr2012/details HR 2012 of 1997] (105th)&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March 1999, it was introduced again and referred to the Subcommittee on Employer-Employee Relations on 30 April 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/hr1277 H.R. 1277] (106th)&lt;/ref&gt; It stalled by 20 December 2000. 

A similar set of proposals regarding pension fund management was reintroduced by Representative [[Peter Visclosky]] in the Employees’ Pension Security Act of 2009, but this also did not yet progress.&lt;ref&gt;HR 4281 (111th). This was introduced before in 2008, HR 5754 (110th), and in 2005, HR 4055 (109th) cosponsored by [[Carolyn Kilpatrick]] [D-MI13]. See also further Joint Trusteeship Bill of 1989, [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/101/hr2664 HR 2664] (101st). This gained [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/101/hr2664/details 47 co-sponsors]. It was reintroduced in 2002, H.R. 5529 (107th) and 2003, H.R. 323 (108th).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a new version of the Workplace Democracy Act was introduced by both Bernie Sanders in the Senate and [[Mark Pocan]] in the House, receiving multiple sponsors but not passing as the Republican Party held majorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s2142 S 2142 (114th)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, an extended version of the 2015 Bill was proposed by Bernie Sanders.

'''Yola''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|oʊ|l|ə}}) is a [[website builder]] and [[website hosting]] company headquartered in [[San Francisco]]. However, it was founded in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. People without programming and graphic design skills can make web sites using Yola. Its drag and drop system allows users to incorporate widgets without knowing [[HTML]]. Yola also integrates [[e-commerce]] and blog software and acts as a [[domain registrar]]. It competes with other web hosting and creation such as [[Wix.com|Wix]], [[Weebly]], [[Jimdo]] and [[Webs (web hosting)|Webs]].&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid, Jason. (June 10, 2008). "[https://techcrunch.com/2008/06/10/weebly-adds-adsense-support-for-drag-and-drop-cash/ Weebly Adds AdSense Support For Drag And Drop Cash]." ''[[TechCrunch]]''. Retrieved June 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate history==
The business started out under the name SynthaSite, founded by [[Vinny Lingham]] in March 2007. In November 2007, the company raised a $5 million round of financing from Columbus Venture Capital and launched the [[beta version]] of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Vinny Lingham’s Gyft keeps on giving  |author= Daily Maveric |url= https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2014-08-05-vinny-linghams-gyft-keeps-on-giving/#.Wu9A5Mi-lE4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, SynthaSite announced $20 million in [[Venture round#Round names|Series B funding]] from Reinet fund.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10205230-36.html|title=Web site builder SynthaSite rebrands as Yola|first=Caroline|last=McCarthy|date=March 26, 2009|work=The Social|publisher=[[CNET Networks]]|accessdate=June 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was renamed Yola on March 26, 2009.&lt;ref name="venturebeat0903"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/03/26/synthasite-no-more-website-builder-now-called-yola/|title=SynthaSite no more — website builder now called Yola|date=March 26, 2009|first=Anthony|last=Ha|work=VentureBeat|accessdate=June 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lingham said the rename was in anticipation of the company’s future direction, and further that "the name SynthaSite has brought us to where we are today, but it won't take us where we want to go. We're reaching a global market and need a name that is easy to say, resonates in any language, and captures the creativity and excitement that our users bring to their Websites."&lt;ref name="cnet" /&gt;

According to Yola's management, together with the Synthasite users, in January 2009 there were more than a million users of the tools, including small businesses, individuals and groups.&lt;ref name="venturebeat0901"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/01/07/website-builder-synthasite-reaches-1m-users/|title= Website builder SynthaSite reaches 1M users|date=January 7, 2009|first=Anthony|last=Ha|work=VentureBeat|accessdate=June 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012 Yola introduced a fully functional online store that provides shopping cart functionality and gateways for various payment providers among other things. It is priced as a $10.00 per month add on for customers with a hosting package.&lt;ref name="yolastore"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yola.com/blog/start-selling-your-products-online/|title= Start selling your products online|date=February 2, 2012|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online store feature is being developed and maintained by a company called [[Ecwid]]. Yola users can now integrate this store widget into their websites via simple drag and drop. While this addition has been well received, critics point out that Yola will now be dependent on an external company for the development of one of their key features.&lt;ref name="yolastore2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.websitetooltester.com/news/yola-online-store-review/|title= Review of Yola's online store on WebsiteToolTester|date=March 3, 2012|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yola's website indicates that there are now more than 9 million Yola users (Oct 2013)&lt;ref name="7million-users"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yola.com/|title= 8 million Yola users|date=October 2013|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
