'''Abdullah Ghanim Khawar''' is a 35-year-old notorious Qatari national and [[Qatar]]-based [[Qatar|terrorist financier]], who previously worked as a salesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defenddemocracy.org/content/uploads/publications/Qatar_Part_I.pdf|title=Qatar and Terror Finance.

==Biography==
Khawar was born in [[Qatar]] on August 17, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20110728.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://regulations.justia.com/regulations/fedreg/2011/08/03/2011-19643.html|title=Designation of Six Individuals Pursuant to Executive Order 13224, 46896-46897 [2011-19643]|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=Justia Regulation Tracker|access-date=2016-11-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of the Treasury]], he's obtained status as a U.S.-[[Al-Qaeda|designated al-Qaeda]] facilitator and financier in Qatar. He is closely linked with [[Salim al-Kuwari]], another U.S.-designated al-Qaeda financier who previously worked for Qatar's ministry of interior, with whom he worked with to deliver money, information, and other material support to al-Qaeda leaders in [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1261.aspx|title=Treasury Targets Key Al-Qa’ida Funding and Support Network Using Iran as a Critical Transit Point|website=www.treasury.gov|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/11156327/Al-Qaeda-terror-financier-worked-for-Qatari-government.html|title=Al-Qaeda terror financier worked for Qatari government|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuwari would donate would donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to al-Qaeda in Iran over the years using the assistance of Abdullah Ghanim Mafuz Muslim al-Khawar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://formiche.net/2014/08/27/i-paesi-del-golfo-persico-che-finanziano-lisis/|title=Chi finanzia Isis.

According to other renowned terrorist financier [[Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi|Abd al-Rahman al-Nuayami's]] [[Alkarama]], the human rights organization that was a used as front for coordinating terrorist activities and funding, that Khawar was arrested along with Kuwari in June 2009, and the two were detained for nearly 1 year. Alkarama promoted their case as a human rights cause with the [[Working Group on Arbitrary Detention|UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.alkarama.org/qatar/387-qatar-abdullah-khowar-and-salem-al-kuwari-arbitrarily-detained-since-six-months|title=Qatar: Abdullah Khowar and Salem Al-Kuwari arbitrarily detained since six months|last=|first=|date=|work=Alkarama Foundation|access-date=2016-11-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, shortly after Kuwari was released and permitted to return to his previous job at the Interior Ministry in Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/11156327/Al-Qaeda-terror-financier-worked-for-Qatari-government.html|title=Al-Qaeda terror financier worked for Qatari government|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/world-leaders-1/pdfs/2010/June2010ChiefsDirectory.pdf|title=Chiefs of State &amp; Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments|last=|first=|date=2016-06-01|website=Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear what happened to Khawar at this time, but it can be assumed that he was released as well. In early 2011, the two were detained once again, and Alkarama advocated for the pair once more in [[Doha]] with the same UN group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.alkarama.org/qatar/733-qatar-civil-servant-held-without-charge|title=Qatar: Civil servant held without charge|last=|first=|date=|work=Alkarama Foundation|access-date=2016-11-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the UN group could take action, Khawar had been re-released. He attempted to leave Qatar, and at this time, [[Saudi Arabia]]n authorities soon arrested him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ar.alkarama.org/saudia/item/4149-2014-08-03-16-04-57|title=المملكة العربية السعودية: السيد عبد الله خوار، المواطن القطري معرض لخطر التعذيب|last=|first=|date=|work=|language=Arabic|access-date=2016-11-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.N. group intervened, under the impression that he was arrested inhumanely for expressing his political views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/SP/A.HRC.18.51.pdf|title=Communications Report of Special Procedures|last=|first=|date=2011-09-05|website=United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner|publisher=United Nations General Assembly|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Khawar has had quite a few confrontations with law enforcement between the years of 2009 and 2011, but he has not been charged with any crime and still continues to function with an Iran-based al-Qaeda network, headed by [[Ezedin Abdel Aziz Khalil]].

'''Allen Sapp''', [[Order of Canada|OC]], [[Saskatchewan Order of Merit|SOM]] (January 2, 1928 – December 29, 2015) was a Canadian [[Cree]] painter, who resided in [[North Battleford]], [[Saskatchewan]]. His art and his story have become well known throughout Canada. His paintings tell a personal story, and many feature images of his grandmother.  His work and life story have been the subject of a number of books and television documentaries.

==Early life==
Sapp was born on the Red Pheasant Reserve, south of the city of North Battleford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestarphoenix.com/news/saskatchewan/canada-150-allen-sapp "Indigenous reality revealed in Cree painter Allen Sapp's work"]. Betty Ann Adam, ''Saskatoon Star-Phoenix'', June 6, 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; His mother suffered from tuberculosis and died during his adolescence.

Sapp was raised by his maternal grandmother and grandfather, Albert and Maggie Soonias. As a child he was often ill and spent long hours in bed.&lt;ref name="Centre1972"&gt;University of Saskatchewan. Indian and Northern Curriculum Resources Centre. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7tDiAAAAMAAJ Indian, Metis and Eskimo Leaders in Contemporary Canada]''. Indian and Northern Curriculum Resources Centre, College of Education, University of Saskatchewan; 1972*.&lt;/ref&gt; His grandmother nurtured him and encouraged his love of drawing, while teaching him in the Cree ways.

He attended the Red Pheasant school, but his grandfather removed him from the school because he needed him on the farm. Sapp remained at home and cared for his grandmother until she died in 1963. 

==Career==
After her death, Sapp moved to North Battleford to try to make a living as an artist, selling paintings door to door.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SGHXAAAAMAAJ The Northian]''. Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation; p. 16–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 he met Dr. Allan Gonor, who recognized Sapp's talent and encouraged him to paint what he knew—life on the reserve. Sapp began to paint his childhood memories, often staying up all night painting. Gonor helped him to sell several paintings to the Winnipeg Art Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;"Allen Sapp". ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=68kzAQAAIAAJ SouthwestArt]''. Art Magazine Publishers; 1975. p. 82–84.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, 40 of his paintings were displayed in an exhibition at the Robertson Galleries.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SKFRAQAAMAAJ Indian News]''. Vol. 11-15. Indian and Eskimo Affairs Program; 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, his work was known across North America and as far away as London, England.

In 1986, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] "for his portrayals of Native peoples and of life on the reserve".&lt;ref&gt;{{OCC|1503}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, he was awarded the [[Saskatchewan Order of Merit]].&lt;ref name=hill&gt;Andrea Hill. [http://thestarphoenix.com/feature/brushed-off-documents-suggest-sapp-felt-taken-advantage-of "Brushed Off: Documents suggest Sapp felt taken advantage of"]. ''Star-Phoenix'',  September 28, 2017. &lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he was elected to the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]].&lt;ref name=RCA1880&gt;{{cite web|title=Members since 1880 |url=http://www.rca-arc.ca/en/about_members/since1880.asp |publisher=Royal Canadian Academy of Arts |accessdate=11 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526215339/http://www.rca-arc.ca/en/about_members/since1880.asp |archivedate=May 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he received the [[Governor General's Award for English language children's illustration]] for the book, ''[[The Song Within My Heart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UEcOAQAAMAAJ The Book Review Digest: Annual cumulation]''. H. W. Wilson Company; 2005. p. 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of his artistic success, Sapp's lack of education and disinterest in practical matters led to difficulties in managing his finances. He and his wife continued to live in a small home near North Battleford.&lt;ref name=hill /&gt; He died in his sleep on December 29, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/grandfather-of-saskatchewan-art-allen-sapp-dies-at-87-1.3383937|title='Grandfather of Saskatchewan art' Allen Sapp dies at age 87|date=30 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/remembering-saskatchewan-artist-allen-sapp|title=Remembering Saskatchewan artist Allen Sapp|author =Morgan Modjeski|author2 =Saskatoon StarPhoenix More Morgan Modjeski|author3 =Saskatoon StarPhoenix|work=Saskatoon StarPhoenix}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paintings illustrate the award-winning ''Nokum: is My Teacher'' by David Bouchard with music by the drum group [[Northern Cree]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bouchard|Bouchard, David]] (2006).

'''Mayer Alphonse James Rothschild''' (1 February 1827 &amp;ndash; 26 May 1905), was a [[France|French]] [[financier]], [[vineyard]] owner, [[art]] collector, [[philanthropist]], racehorse owner/breeder and a member of the prominent [[Rothschild banking family of France]].

==Biography==
Known as Alphonse, he was the eldest son of [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] (1792–1868). His mother was [[Betty de Rothschild]] (1805–1886), the daughter of [[Salomon Mayer von Rothschild]] from the [[Rothschild banking family of Austria|Austrian branch]] of the family. Alphonse was educated to take his place at the head of [[de Rothschild Frères]] bank, training in the other Rothschild banking houses in Europe. In France he soon became a major force in the financial world and in 1855 was appointed a regent of the [[Banque de France]], a position he held for the remainder of his life.

In 1857 Alphonse de Rothschild married a cousin, [[Leonora de Rothschild|Leonora "Laure" de Rothschild]] (1837–1911), the daughter of [[Lionel de Rothschild]] (1808–1879) of the [[Rothschild banking family of England|English branch]] of the family. They had four children. Their firstborn, Bettina Caroline (1858–1892), married [[Albert Salomon von Rothschild]].

==As a vineyard operator==
Alphonse and his brother [[Gustave Samuel de Rothschild|Gustave]] developed somewhat of a rivalry with their English cousin [[Nathaniel de Rothschild]] who had moved to Paris after marrying their sister [[Charlotte de Rothschild|Charlotte]]. Nathaniel worked at de Rothschild Frères bank and in 1853 he purchased the [[Château Mouton Rothschild|Château Brane Mouton]] [[vineyard]] in [[Pauillac]] in the [[Médoc]] wine growing region. Nathaniel's Mouton vineyard received a second-growth ranking in the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]. Just three months before their father died in 1868, Alphonse and Gustave convinced him to buy the more prestigious [[First Growth]] [[Château Lafite-Rothschild|Château Lafite]] vineyard in Pauillac when it came up for sale.

On the death of their father in 1868, Alphonse and Gustave inherited the Château Lafite-Rothschild vineyard. However, they lived in Paris and the vineyard was not significant relative to their massive investments in banking and other business ventures. As such, they only visited the Pauillac vineyard occasionally, maintaining little more than an arms-length interest. On their deaths, the Rothschild brothers willed the property to a son and it remains in family hands to this day.

==As a financier and investor==
Alphonse de Rothschild inherited a large fortune on the death of his father in 1868, including share positions in de Rothschild Frères bank and the [[Chemin de Fer du Nord|Northern Railway]] company. He began his training in finance at a young age and his father put him in charge of the bank's gold [[bullion]] operations.

During the 1860s, great debates raged across [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] as to an appropriate [[monetary system]] for the changing times. In France, the prominent  [[Péreire brothers]] bankers were proponents of [[Banknote|paper money]] in contrast to Alphonse de Rothschild who defended preservation of France's [[bimetallism]] system. Initially, Alphonse had an influential supporter for his position through his long friendship with statesman [[Léon Say]], a former employee of the Rothschild's [[Chemin de Fer du Nord|Northern Railway Company]] who became the [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|Minister of Finance]] in 1872. However, as part of the [[Latin Monetary Union]] France joined most of the rest of Europe and adopted the [[gold standard]] by 1873. In 1880, Alphonse de Rothschild put together the deal that saw the family take control of [[Société Le Nickel]] (SLN), a [[nickel]] mining business in [[New Caledonia]].

During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Alphonse de Rothschild had guarded the ramparts of Paris on the eve of the [[Prussia]]n siege. When a peace treaty was finally agreed to in January 1871, his bank would play a major role, not only in raising the five billion francs France was obliged to pay in reparations to the new [[German Empire]], but in helping bring about economic stability. France made a dramatic financial recovery and repaid the reparations bill ahead of schedule which, under terms of the armistice, brought about an end to the German occupation of northern French territory in 1873. In contrast though, that same year, both the [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]] stock markets crashed, plunging all of Central Europe into an economic depression. However, in less than a decade Alphonse de Rothschild would witness considerable economic upheaval in France. The collapse of the investment bank [[Société de l'Union Générale]] precipitated the 1882 [[stock market crash]] that triggered a downturn in the economy. In 1889, the [[Comptoir d'Escompte de Paris]] bank went into receivership and shortly thereafter the [[Panama scandals]] erupted, culminating in an official enquiry into the matter conducted in 1893 by the French parliament.

His intense pressure pushed back the abrogation project of the ''[[Crémieux Decree|décret Crémieux]]'' filed by the chief of the provisional government, [[Adolphe Thiers]] in 1871.

Already made a member of the [[Legion of Honor]], for his contributions to the French economy at a time of crisis, in 1896 Alphonse de Rothschild was elevated to the Grand Cross, the highest class of the Legion of Honor.

==Thoroughbred racing==
Alphonse de Rothschild was an enthusiastic supporter of [[thoroughbred horse racing]] who in 1852 at the age of twenty-four became a member of the [[France Galop|Paris Jockey Club]]. He eventually purchased a rural property near [[Touques, Calvados]] in the [[Lower Normandy]] region where he built the [[Haras de Meautry]] [[horse breeding]] [[farm]]. There, he laid the foundation for a breeding operation that would prove highly successful for more than one hundred years and one that under the guidance of his descendants remains in operation today. Alphonse de Rothschild raced in an era before the creation of the [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]]. Among the major races which his horses won were:
*[[Grand Prix de Paris]] - (1) - ''Le Roi Soleil (1898)''
*[[Prix de Diane]] - (3) - ''Brie (1878), Crinière (1889) Brisk (1894)''
*[[Poule d'Essai des Poulains]] - (3) - ''Brio (1887), Heaume (1890) et Le Nicham II (1893)''
*[[Prix du Jockey Club]] - (2) - ''Kilt (1876) Heaume (1890)''
*[[Prix de la Forêt]] - (2) - ''Kilt (1876) Le Nord (1891)''
*[[Prix Morny]] - (4) - ''Louis d'Or (1879), Strelitz (1880), Fresca (1893) Thélème (1903)''

==As an art collector==
Over his lifetime Alphonse de Rothschild put together a massive collection of artworks. He was an avid collector of the [[Dutch Masters]] as well as an important assembler of [[Islam]]ic works of art. In 1885 he was made a member of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] and would donate and/or bequeath approximately 2,000 pieces to many different museums.

==Residences==
As part of his father's estate, Alphonse de Rothschild inherited a large residence in Paris at 2 rue Saint-Florentin on [[Place de la Concorde]] which today is part of the [[American Embassy, Paris|American Embassy]] complex. In addition, he also received the [[Château de Ferrières]], an enormous mansion and woodlands in the country about 26&amp;nbsp;km east of Paris.

==Assassination attempt==
In August 1895, a crude [[Mailbomb|letter bomb]] addressed to Alphonse de Rothschild was delivered to his Paris residence. Not at home, a member of the house staff had it forwarded to the de Rothschild Frères offices where it detonated, seriously injuring the chief clerk.

On his death in 1905, Alphonse's son [[Édouard Alphonse James de Rothschild|Edouard]] took over as head of the family business.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9515">[[File:Official CENTCOM Seal.png|right|thumb|175px|Emblem of the [[United States Central Command]]]]

In August 2015, [[intelligence analysts]] working for [[United States Central Command]] (CENTCOM) complained to the media, alleging that CENTCOM's senior leadership was altering or distorting intelligence reports on the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) to paint a more optimistic picture of the ongoing war against ISIL forces in Iraq and Syria.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt;&lt;ref name=TheHill /&gt;

In August 2016, a United States Congressional report found "widespread dissatisfaction" among CENTCOM's intelligence analysts.&lt;ref name=NYT20160811&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooper|first1=Helene|title=Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/12/us/politics/isis-centcom-intelligence.html|accessdate=10 April 2018|publisher=New York Times|date=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A press release on the report stated “Intelligence products approved by senior CENTCOM leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community."&lt;ref name=NYT20160811 /&gt;

In February 2017, the Inspector General of the [[United States Department of Defense]] completed its investigation and cleared the senior leadership of CENTCOM, concluding that "allegations of intelligence being intentionally altered, delayed or suppressed by top CENTCOM officials from mid-2014 to mid-2015 were largely unsubstantiated."&lt;ref name="CNN20170201"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Zachary|title=Report: Centcom leaders didn't cook ISIS intelligence|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/report-centcom-intelligence/index.html|accessdate=10 April 2018|agency=CNN|date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015 allegations by CENTCOM analysts==
In 2014, ISIL declared a [[worldwide caliphate]] and the US began [[American-led intervention in Syria|military campaigns in Syria]] and [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|Iraq]] to try to halt the spread of that caliphate as well as the [[Syrian Train and Equip Program]].  These efforts were conducted by the [[United States Central Command]] (CENTCOM), the U.S. geographic [[combatant command]] for the Middle East. CENTCOM military intelligence analysts were responsible with generating intelligence reports that would inform civilian leadership about the effectiveness of allied military efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/News/Special-Reports/0814_Inherent-Resolve|title=Special Report: Operation Inherent Resolve|website=U.S. Department of Defense|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, fifty CENTCOM analysts signed a complaint to the Pentagon's [[Office of the Inspector General|Inspector General]] that their intelligence reports were being inappropriately manipulated by members of CENTCOM.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-confirms-investigation-skewed-intelligence-isis/story?id=33772763|title=Pentagon Confirms Probe Into 'Skewed' ISIS Intelligence|last=|first=|date=2015-09-15|website=ABC News|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were subsequently joined by civilian and [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] analysts working for CENTCOM. Members of the groups began anonymously leaking details of the case to the press in late-August.&lt;ref name=TheHill&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/253188-report-analysts-claim-us-military-altering-intelligence-on-isis-war|title=Report: Analysts claim US military altering intelligence on ISIS war|last=Wong|first=Kristina|date=2015-09-10|work=TheHill|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysts alleged that CENTCOM was trying to portray a rosy image of the fight against the Islamic State by altering some reports to seem more positive, while burying other reports to keep them from the press and Congress.&lt;ref name=NYT20160811 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11855274/Dozens-of-US-spies-complain-Isil-reports-rewritten-to-show-Syria-campaign-is-working.html|title=US spies complain Isil reports 'rewritten to show Syria campaign is working'|last=Sherlock|first=Ruth|date=2015-09-10|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/amb-marc-ginsberg/obamas-syrian-strategery_b_8155424.html|title=Syrian "Strategery" -- Brought to You By Cooked Intel??|last=Ginsberg|first=Marc|authorlink=Marc Ginsberg|date=2015-09-17|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysts alleged that the conclusions of both their reports about the readiness of indigenous forces to face ISIS, and about the effectiveness of the American air campaigns over Syria and Iraq, were reversed by the Administration before distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/us/politics/analysts-said-to-provide-evidence-of-distorted-reports-on-isis.html|title=Analysts Detail Claims That Reports on ISIS Were Distorted|last=Mazzetti|first=Mark|date=2015-09-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-06|last2=Apuzzo|first2=Matt|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The media described the situation as "a revolt" inside the [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/09/exclusive-50-spies-say-isis-intelligence-was-cooked|title=Exclusive: 50 Spies Say ISIS Intelligence Was Cooked|last=Youssef|first=Nancy A.|date=2015-09-10|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2017-10-06|last2=Harris|first2=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/intelligence-analyst-isis-allegations-2015-9|title=Former CIA director under Obama: 'Someone needs to lose their job' if reports about ISIS intelligence are true|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Congressional representatives vowed to investigate the matter and requested testimony from Department of Defense officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/us/politics/analysts-said-to-provide-evidence-of-distorted-reports-on-isis.html|title=Analysts Detail Claims That Reports on ISIS Were Distorted|last=Mazzetti|first=Mark|date=2015-09-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-06|last2=Apuzzo|first2=Matt|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016 Congressional report==
In August 2016, a United States Congressional report found "widespread dissatisfaction" among CENTCOM's intelligence analysts.&lt;ref name=NYT20160811&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooper|first1=Helene|title=Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/12/us/politics/isis-centcom-intelligence.html|accessdate=10 April 2018|publisher=New York Times|date=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A press release on the report stated “Intelligence products approved by senior CENTCOM leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community."&lt;ref name=NYT20160811 /&gt;  According to the report, “Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events."&lt;ref name=NYT20160811 /&gt;  The report provided an example of these overestimations, commenting that a CENTCOM official "stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.”&lt;ref name=NYT20160811 /&gt;

Republicans and Democrats in Congress commented on the report.  According to Republican Representative [[Mike Pompeo]], “From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command’s most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command’s intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.”&lt;ref name=NYT20160811 /&gt;  According to Democrat Representative [[Adam Schiff]], “Between 2014 and 2015, CENTCOM created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces,” which “stalled the release of intelligence products" and “insufficiently accommodated dissenting views.”&lt;ref name=NYT20160811 /&gt;

==2017 Inspector General's report==
In February 2017, the Inspector General completed its investigation and cleared the senior leadership of CENTCOM, concluding that "allegations of intelligence being intentionally altered, delayed or suppressed by top CENTCOM officials from mid-2014 to mid-2015 were largely unsubstantiated."&lt;ref name="CNN20170201"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Zachary|title=Report: Centcom leaders didn't cook ISIS intelligence|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/report-centcom-intelligence/index.html|accessdate=10 April 2018|agency=CNN|date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the commanding general of CENTCOM, General [[Joseph Votel]], "While the allegations were unsubstantiated, the DoD IG's report did provide thoughtful and helpful recommendations on ways to make improvements within the command and we are taking those and others' recommendations to heart and acting on them."&lt;ref name="CNN20170201" /&gt;

'''Daniel Roberdeau''' (1727 – January 5, 1795) was an [[Americans|American]] merchant residing in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] at the time of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]]. He represented Pennsylvania from 1777 to 1779 in the [[Continental Congress]]. Roberdeau served as a [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the Pennsylvania state [[Militia (United States)|militia]] during the war. He was a signer of the [[Articles of Confederation]].

==Family and early life==
Roberdeau was born in 1727 on the [[Saint Kitts|Island of St. Christopher]] in the [[West Indies]]. His father was a [[Huguenot]] immigrant named Isaac Roberdeau; his mother, a [[Scottish people|Scot]], Mary Cunningham. After the death of his father, he immigrated to Philadelphia with his mother and sisters. Roberdeau became a timber merchant and, for a number of years, served on the Board of Managers for a hospital in Philadelphia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Early service==
Roberdeau was active in establishing [[Freemasonry]] in Philadelphia, which brought him to the attention of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and other civic leaders. He was elected to the Pennsylvania [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly|Colonial Assembly]], serving from 1756 to 1760, but then declined further service.

==Revolutionary War service==
When war neared, he joined the [[Associators]] (as the Pennsylvania rebel militia was known), and was made [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of his regiment. In May 1776 he presided at several public meetings calling for the existing Pennsylvania delegation to the Continental Congress to be replaced with members who supported a [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. As a result, he was named to the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]], and on July 4, 1776 was named a brigadier general in the state militia.

==Congressional service==
Roberdeau was first elected to the Continental Congress in February 1777 and served there until 1779. Later that year, when the [[Continental Army]] entered winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]], he worked with General Washington to set up a militia support network known as the [[Flying Camp]], and served as its commander.

In April 1778, Roberdeau took a short leave from Congress. He had noted the shortage of powder and shot in the army, and used the time off to establish a lead mine in [[Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Bedford County]]. To protect the mine and camp from [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] attacks, he built a palisade, [[Fort Roberdeau]], at his own expense.  Historically, Roberdeau's fort was known as the "Lead Mine Fort".  It has been reconstructed near its original site in Sinking Valley, near present-day Altoona, [[Blair County, Pennsylvania|Blair County]], Pennsylvania.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

After the war he moved to [[Alexandria, Virginia]], and eventually settled in [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]], where he died in 1795. He is buried in the [[Mount Hebron Cemetery and Gatehouse|Mt. Hebron Cemetery]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{FAG|11610922}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Isaac Roberdeau, became a civil engineer and U.S. Army officer, who helped [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Pierre L'Enfant]] lay out the plan for [[Washington, D.C.]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

'''Dena Laettner Schlosser''' (born 1969) is a woman from Texas who, on November 22, 2004, used a knife to [[Amputation|amputate]] the arms of her eleven-month-old daughter, Margaret, who died as a result. Plano police responded to a [[9-1-1]] call made by concerned workers at a local day care center who had spoken to her earlier that day. The operator testified that she confessed to her and that the gospel song, "[[He Touched Me (song)|He Touched Me]]" played in the background. When police arrived, they saw her calmly sitting down, covered in blood, holding the knife, and singing [[Christianity|Christian]] hymns.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/20/AR2006022001197.html|title=Mother Says God Told Her to Cut Baby|date=2006-02-21|accessdate=2007-03-19|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hours after her arrest, police heard her repeatedly chanting, "Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord."&lt;ref name=Secrets&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets Can Be Murder: What America’s Most Sensational Crimes Tell Us About Ourselves|last=Velez-Mitchell|first=Jane|authorlink=Jane Velez-Mitchell|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|location=New York City|year=2007|isbn=0743299361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
At the age of eight, Dena Laettner was diagnosed with [[hydrocephalus]]. She had eight surgeries to implant [[Cerebral shunt|shunts]] into her brain, heart and abdomen before she was 13 years old. Her schoolmates made fun of her shaved head.&lt;ref name="dallasobserver2006"/&gt; She graduated from [[Marist College]] in [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="dallasobserver2006"&gt;{{cite web|first=Glenna|last=Whitley|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2006-05-18/news/the-devil-and-doyle-davidson/full|title=The Devil and Doyle Davidson|work=[[Dallas Observer]]|date=2006-05-18|accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She met her husband, John, when they were both students at Marist. She graduated from Marist, but he did not. Eventually they moved to Texas, where he would not allow her to work.&lt;ref name="dallasobserver2006"/&gt;

==Margaret's killing==
The day after Margaret was born, Schlosser attempted suicide, was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward, and diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]] with [[Psychosis|psychotic features]].&lt;ref name="dallasobserver2006"/&gt; She had been investigated earlier that year by the Texas Child Protective Services (CPS) after she was hospitalized for a psychotic episode. CPS ordered that she could not be alone with her children. Her sister-in-law came to live with them until CPS lifted the order.&lt;ref name="dallasobserver2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc"/&gt; She came to believe that Margaret was destined to marry Doyle Davidson, a veterinarian who had become their pastor. The day before she attacked Margaret, Schlosser told her husband that she wanted to give her to Davidson. Later that day, according to a confidential CPS report, he spanked her with a wooden spoon in front of their children.&lt;ref name="dallasobserver2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lubbockonline1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/021105/upd_075-5140.shtml|title=Psychologist says Schlosser didn't do enough to protect slain daughter|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=2005-02-11|accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She fatally injured Margaret,&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6561617|title=Mother confesses to severing baby's arms|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601063744/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6561617|archive-date=2007-06-01|date=2004-11-23|accessdate=2007-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; while her other two daughters were not harmed.

Psychologist David Self testified that Schlosser told him about a disturbing news story she had seen. The news story concerned a boy who was mauled by a lion and she interpreted it as a sign of the coming [[apocalypse]]. She said that she heard God commanding her to remove Margaret's arms and then her own.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt; The attack was later described as "religious frenzy".&lt;ref name="beltway"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.outsidethebeltway.com/2006/04/dena-schlosser-not-guilty-by-reason-of-insanity |title=Dena Schlosser Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity |work=OTB News |date=2006-04-08 |accessdate=2007-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209152939/http://news.outsidethebeltway.com/2006/04/dena-schlosser-not-guilty-by-reason-of-insanity |archivedate=2007-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self determined that she suffered from [[postpartum psychosis]].&lt;ref name="postpartumpsychosis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/040806dnmetschlosser.108ec24a.html|title=Schlosser case ends with insanity ruling|newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=2007-04-07|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was found [[Insanity plea|not guilty by reason of insanity]] and was committed to the [[North Texas State Hospital]] and ordered to stay there until she is deemed to no longer be a threat to herself or others.&lt;ref name="beltway"/&gt; There, she was a roommate of [[Andrea Yates]], a Texas woman who had drowned her five children in a bathtub.&lt;ref name="dallasnews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/100806dnmetdenafriend.36e291a.html|title=Schlosser and Yates find solace in friendship|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=2006-04-08|accessdate=2007-03-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211161616/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/100806dnmetdenafriend.36e291a.html|archivedate=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, much attention was drawn to Schlosser and her husband attending Water of Life Church, a [[charismatic movement|charismatic]] church pastored by Davidson. She had been taking [[antipsychotic]] drugs for several years prior to Margaret's death. Davidson thought that mental illness was demonic and this belief partly led Schlosser's husband to not buy her medication regularly.&lt;ref name="dallasobserver2006"/&gt; Under oath, Davidson testified that in his view, all mental illness is demonic at bottom.&lt;ref name="dallasobserver2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Secrets/&gt; Due to viewer outcry after the trial, Davidson's television ministry was canceled everywhere outside the Metroplex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilonsky |first=Robert |url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2008/05/whatever_you_do_dont_sip_the_w.php |title=Whatever You Do, Don't Sip the Water of Life. It's Really Crazy Juice |work=[[Dallas Observer]] |date=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Schlosser's arrest, her children were taken by CPS and kept in foster care. Schlosser's husband underwent a psychological evaluation, where he was diagnosed with "narcissistic personality traits."&lt;ref name="lubbockonline1"/&gt; The psychological report also stated that he did not do enough to protect his daughters from his mentally ill wife. CPS said they would only allow him to regain custody of them under the condition that his sister live with the family, and he was required to complete psychotherapy and parenting classes. He obliged and got them back in his home.&lt;ref name="lubbockonline1"/&gt; He subsequently filed for divorce. As part of the divorce settlement, Schlosser was prohibited from ever having contact with him or their daughters again.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

On November 6, 2008, it was announced that Schlosser would shortly be released into outpatient care. The order required her to see a psychiatrist once a week, take medication, be on physician-approved [[Contraception|birth control]], and not have any unsupervised contact with children.&lt;ref name="dallasnews08"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/110808dnmetschlosser.18ca635cc.html|title=Dena Schlosser, Plano mom who cut off baby's arms, moving to outpatient care|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=2008-11-08|accessdate=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, it was reported that Schlosser was recommitted after firefighters from [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]] saw her walking down the street at 2 am. Her attorney, David Haynes, said that he felt the judge made the correct decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Mom-Who-Cut-Off-Babys-Arms-Back-in-Hospital-92001754.html Mom Who Cut Off Baby's Arms Back in Hospital] NBC Dallas-Fort Worth&lt;/ref&gt;

Schlosser was later released to outpatient status. She stayed out of the public eye until 2012, when [[WFAA-TV]] in [[Dallas]] reported that she was working under her maiden name, Laettner, at a [[Walmart]] in [[Terrell, Texas|Terrell]]. Within hours, they fired her.&lt;ref&gt;Shipp, Brett; Woodard, Teresa.

==In the media==
Schlosser was briefly seen in the 2005 [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[The God Who Wasn't There]]'', which is critical of Christianity.

Schlosser is cited by [[atheist]] writer/director [[Brian Flemming]], who was raised in a [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] home, as one of a series of people who committed and or incited others to commit crimes under the pretext of them being [[Divine inspiration|divinely inspired]]. Her caption reads, "Devout Christian; Cut her baby's arms off, for God". [[Charles Manson]], [[Pat Robertson]], [[Tim LaHaye]], and [[Jerry B. Jenkins]] (the authors of the ''[[Left Behind (series)|Left Behind]]'' series of books), and the victims of the [[Branch Davidians|Branch Davidian]] [[Waco siege|siege]] in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]] (described as "86 crispy fans of similar apocalyptic literature") are also shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Brian Flemming]]|title=[[The God Who Wasn't There]]|medium=[[DVD]]|publisher=Beyond Belief Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a segment about Schlosser in an August 23, 2013 episode of ''[[Deadly Women]]'' called "Evil Guardians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigation Discovery {{!}} August 2013 Highlights|url=https://cf-media.press.discovery.com/ugc/highlights/ID_August_2013_HIGHLIGHTS_FINAL.pdf|website=cf-media.press.discovery.com|accessdate=19 April 2018|format=pdf|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evil Guardians {{!}} Deadly Women|url=https://www.investigationdiscovery.com/tv-shows/deadly-women/full-episodes/evil-guardians|website=www.investigationdiscovery.com|accessdate=19 April 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Gryffydh Peacock''' (30 July 1825 &amp;ndash; 4 January 1867) was an English official of the [[East India Company]], publisher, writer and rower who won the [[Wingfield Sculls]] and [[Diamond Challenge Sculls]] at [[Henley Royal Regatta]].

Peacock was the son of the poet [[Thomas Love Peacock]] and his wife Jane Gryffydh.&lt;ref name="Meredith"&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography - Thomas Love Peacock&lt;/ref&gt; In 1841 he was appointed midshipman in the Indian Navy. He arrived in India in October 1841&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UyEYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA391 Asiatic Journal 1841]&lt;/ref&gt; but returned to England for medical reasons in April 1842. In 1844 he became a clerk in the examiners office at East India House.&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VDnz8Bv3Hi8C&amp;pg=PA59 Stewart Marsh Ellis ''George Meredith: his life and friends in relation to his work'']&lt;/ref&gt; He  collaborated with [[George Meredith]] in publishing a privately circulated literary magazine, the ''Monthly Observer''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/george-meredith   Poetry Foundation -- George Meredith]&lt;/ref&gt;

Peacock was a member of [[Thames Club]] and in 1845 was runner up in the [[Silver Goblets|Silver Wherries]] at [[Henley Royal Regatta]] partnering [[Henry Chapman (rower)|Henry Chapman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rowinghistory.net/HRR%20US/hrr_1839-1939.htm Henley Royal Regatta Results of Final Races 1839–1939] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309113109/http://www.rowinghistory.net/HRR%20US/hrr_1839-1939.htm |date=March 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1849 he won the Silver Wherries partnering [[Francis Playford]]. He won the [[Diamond Challenge Sculls]] at Henley in 1851 defeating [[Edward Macnaghten, Baron Macnaghten|Edward Macnaghten]] in the final. In 1852 positions were reversed and Peacock came second to MacNaughton. Peacock won the [[Wingfield Sculls]] in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rowingservice.com/wingfieldsrecords.xls Wingfield Sculls Record of Races] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180753/https://www.rowingservice.com/wingfieldsrecords.xls |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meredith is said to have based his character Edward Blancove in ''Rhoda Fleming'' on Peacock. Like Blancove, Peacock studied as a barrister and was a keen boxer.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;

In 1865 Peacock qualified as a solicitor. However he died two years later at the age of 42. His poem ''The Vicar of Southbury's story: a Christmas poem'' was published posthumously in 1867.

Peacock married Mary Hall in 1849, apparently to the disapproval of his father. They had a son Thomas Love Peacock.&lt;ref name=Ellis/&gt;  She remarried in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/SFK/BecclesandBungay/May1869.shtml East Suffolk Gazette And Beccles And Bungay Weekly News 11 May 1869 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Peacock's widowed sister Mary Ellen Nicolls married [[George Meredith]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Rabbi Eliyahu de Vidas tombstone.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Eliyahu de Vidas in the old Jewish cemetery in Hebron.]]
'''Eliyahu de Vidas''' (1518–1587, Hebron) was a 16th-century [[rabbi]] in [[History of Palestine#Ottoman era|Ottoman Palestine]]. He was primarily a disciple of Rabbis [[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero]] (known as the ''Ramak'') and also [[Isaac Luria]].&lt;ref name="FINE_2003_pp80-81"&gt;[[#FINE_2003|Fine 2003]], pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B2o8vqvrQOcC&amp;pg=PA81 81]: "Cordovero was the teacher of what appears to have been a relatively loose knit circle of disciples. The most important Elijah de Vidas, Abraham Galante, Moses Galante, Hayyim Vital, Abraham ben Eliezer ha-Levi Berukhim, Eleazar Azikri, Samuel Gallico, and an important kabbalist who studied with Cordovero for a short while in the 1560s, Mordechai Dato."&lt;/ref&gt; De Vidas is known for his expertise in the [[Kabbalah]]. He wrote ''[[Reshit Chochmah]]'', or "The Beginning of Wisdom," a pietistic work that is still widely studied by Orthodox Jews today. Just as his teacher Rabbi Moses Cordovero created an ethical work according to kabbalistic principles in his [[Tomer Devorah]], Rabbi de Vidas created an even more expansive work on the spiritual life with his [[Reishit Chochmah]].  This magnum opus is largely based on the [[Zohar]], but also reflects a wide range of traditional sources. The author lived in [[Safed]] and [[Hebron]], and was one of a group of prominent kabbalists living in Hebron during the late 16th and early 17th-century.

'''Gog and Magog''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ɒ|g|...|ˈ|m|eɪ|g|ɒ|g}}; {{lang-he-n|גּוֹג וּמָגוֹג}} ''Gog u-Magog'') in the [[Hebrew Bible]] may be individuals, peoples, or lands; a prophesied enemy nation of God's people according to the [[Book of Ezekiel]], and according to Genesis, one of the [[Generations of Noah|nations]] descended from [[Japheth]], son of [[Noah]].

The Gog prophecy is meant to be fulfilled at the approach of what is called the "[[End of Days (eschatology)|end of days]]", but not necessarily the end of the world. [[Jewish eschatology]] viewed Gog and Magog as enemies to be defeated by the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]], which will usher in the age of the Messiah. [[Christianity]]'s interpretation is more starkly [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]]&lt;!--[[wikt:doomsday#Adjective|doomsday]]--&gt;: making Gog and Magog allies of [[Satan]] against God at the end of the [[Millennialism|millennium]], as can be read in the [[Book of Revelation]].

A legend was attached to Gog and Magog by the time of the [[Pax Romana|Roman period]], that the [[Gates of Alexander]] were  erected by [[Alexander the Great]] to repel the tribe. Romanized Jewish historian [[Josephus]] knew them as the nation descended from Magog the [[Japhetites|Japhetite]], as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], and explained them to be the [[Scythians]]. In the hands of Early Christian writers they became apocalyptic hordes, and throughout the Medieval period variously identified as the [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Mongols]], [[Altaic|Altaic people]] or other [[Eurasian nomads|nomads]], or even the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of [[Israelites|Israel]].

The legend of Gog and Magog and the gates was also interpolated into the [[Alexander romance]]s. In one version, "Goth and Magoth" are kings of the Unclean Nations, driven beyond a mountain pass by Alexander, and blocked from returning by his new wall. Gog and Magog are said to engage in [[human cannibalism]] in the romances and derived literature. They have also been depicted on Medieval cosmological maps, or ''[[mappa mundi|mappae mundi]]'', sometimes alongside Alexander's wall.

The conflation of Gog and Magog with the legend of Alexander and the Iron Gates was disseminated throughout the Near East in the early centuries of the Christian era.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=123}} They appear in the [[Quran]] as Yajuj and Majuj ({{Lang-ar|يأجوج ومأجوج}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Yaʾjūj wa-Maʾjūj}}''), adversaries of [[Dhul-Qarnayn]], who is mentioned in the Qu'ran as a great righteous ruler and is most commonly considered to be Alexander the Great.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=57, fn 3}} Muslim geographers identified them at first with [[Turkic tribal confederations|Turkic tribes]] from [[Central Asia]] and later with the [[Mongols]]. In modern times they remain associated with apocalyptic thinking, especially in the [[United States]] and the [[Muslim world]].

==The names Gog and Magog==
{{Eschatology}}
The first mention of the two names occurs in the [[Book of Ezekiel]], where Gog is an individual and Magog is his land.{{sfn|Lust|1999b|pp=373–374}} The meaning of the name Gog remains uncertain, and in any case the author of the Ezekiel prophecy seems to attach no particular importance to it.{{sfn|Lust|1999b|pp=373–374}} Efforts have been made to identify him with various individuals, notably [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]], a king of [[Lydia]] in the early 7th century BCE, but many scholars do not believe he is related to any historical person.{{sfn|Lust|1999b|pp=373–374}} 

In Genesis 10 Magog is a person, son of [[Japheth]] son of [[Noah]], but no Gog is mentioned. The name Magog is equally obscure, but may come from the Assyrian ''mat-Gugu'', "Land of Gyges", i.e., Lydia.{{r|gmirkin}} Alternatively, Gog may be derived from Magog rather than the other way round, and "Magog" may be code for [[Babylon]].{{efn|The encryption technique is called ''[[atbash]]''. BBL ("Babylon") when read backwards and displaced by one letter becomes MGG (Magog).}}{{sfn|Lust|1999a|p=536}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bøe|2001|loc=pp. 84, fn 31}}. Lust and Bøe cite Brownlee (1983) "Son of Man Set Your Face: Ezekiel the Refugee Prophet", ''HUCA'' '''54'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The form "Gog and Magog" may have emerged as shorthand for "Gog and/of the land of Magog", based on their usage in the [[Septuagint]], the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible.{{sfn|Buitenwerf|2007|p=166}} An example of this combined form in Hebrew (''Gog u-Magog'') has been found, but its context is unclear, being preserved only in a fragment of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].{{efn|4Q523 scroll}}{{sfn|Buitenwerf|2007|p=172}} In Revelation, Gog and Magog together are the hostile nations of the world.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|pp=89–90}}{{r|mounce}} Gog or Goug the [[Reubenite]]{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|All Reubenites are held to be descendants of Reuben in the view of the Torah, but it is unclear what family relationship Gog's father Joel has with the sons of Reuben in verse 3.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|p=49}}}} occurs in [[1 Chronicles]] 5:4, but he appears to have no connection with the Gog of Ezekiel or Magog of Genesis.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|p=1}}

The Biblical "Gog and Magog" possibly gave derivation of the name [[Gogmagog (giant)|Gogmagog]], a legendary British giant.{{efn|The giant mentioned by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (1136 AD).&lt;!--Simpson &amp; Roud (2000)--&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Simpson |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Roud |first2=Stephen |author-link1=Jacqueline Simpson |author-link2=Steve Roud |title=Oxford Dictionary of English Folklore |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |at=Gogmagog (or Gog and Magog) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTcdvd1iRXsC&amp;pg=PT409 |isbn=9780192100191}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later corrupted folk rendition in print altered the tradition around Gogmagog and [[Corineus]] with two giants Gog and Magog, with whom the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] statues came to be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fairholt |first=Frederick William  |author-link=Frederick William Fairholt |title=Gog and Magog: The Giants in Guildhall; Their Real and Legendary History |publisher=John Camden Hotten |year=1859 |pages=8–11,  130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VoQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judeo-Christian texts==
{{Christian Eschatology}}

===Ezekiel and the Old Testament===
[[File:Flemish - Ezekiel's Vision of the Sign "Tau" (Ezekiel IX -2-7) - Walters 44616 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Ezekiel's Vision of the Sign "Tau" from Ezekiel IX:2–7. {{right|{{small|—[[Mosan art|Mosan]] [[champlevé]] panel, mid-12th century.}}}}]]

The [[Book of Ezekiel]] records a series of visions received by the 6th-century BC prophet [[Ezekiel]], a priest of [[Solomon's Temple]], who was among the captive during the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]]. The exile, he tells his fellow captives, is [[God in Judaism|God]]'s punishment on Israel for turning away, but God will restore his people to [[Jerusalem]] when they return to him.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|1996|p=178}} After this message of reassurance, chapters [[Wikisource:Bible (World English)/Ezekiel#Chapter 38|38–39]], the Gog oracle, tell how Gog of Magog and his hordes will threaten the restored Israel but will be destroyed, after which God will establish a new Temple and dwell with his people for a period of lasting peace (chapters 40–48).{{r|bullock}} The Gog oracle, as internal evidence indicates, was composed substantially later than the chapters around it.{{efn|Composed between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC&lt;!--Tooman (2011), p. 271--&gt;}}{{sfn|Tooman|2011|p=271}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Son of man, direct your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince, leader of [[Meshech]] and [[Tubal]], and prophesy concerning him. Say: Thus said the Lord: Behold, I am against you, Gog, the prince, leader of Meshech and Tubal&amp;nbsp;... Persia, [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]] and Put will be with you&amp;nbsp;... also [[Gomer]] with all its troops, and Beth [[Togarmah]] from the far north with all its troops—the many nations with you."&lt;!-- passage is dialogue, don't remove quotation marks --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+38&amp;version=NRSV Ezekiel 38 (NRSV)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of Gog's allies, Meshech and Tubal were 7th-century kingdoms in central [[Anatolia]] north of Israel, Persia towards east, Cush (Ethiopia) and Put (Libya) to the south; Gomer is the [[Cimmerians]], a nomadic people north of the Black Sea, and Beth Togarmah was on the border of Tubal.{{sfn|Block|1998|pp=72–73, 439–440}} The confederation thus represents a multinational alliance surrounding Israel.{{r|hays-duvall-pate}} "Why the prophet's gaze should have focused on these particular nations is unclear," comments Biblical scholar [[Daniel I. Block]], but their remoteness and reputation for violence and mystery possibly "made Gog and his confederates perfect symbols of the archetypal enemy, rising against God and his people".{{sfn|Block|1998|p=436}} One explanation is that the Gog alliance, a blend of the "[[Generations of Noah|Table of Nations]]" in Genesis 10 and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]'s trading partners in Ezekiel 27, with Persia added, was cast in the role of end-time enemies of Israel by means of Isaiah 66:19, which is another text of eschatological foretelling.{{sfn|Tooman|2011|pp=147–148}}

Although the prophecy refers to Gog as an enemy in some future, it is not clear if the confrontation is meant to occur in a final "[[End of Days (eschatology)|end of days]]" since the Hebrew term ''aḥarit ha-yamim'' ({{lang-he-n|אחרית הימים}}) may merely mean "latter days", and is open to interpretation. Twentieth-century scholars have used the term to denote the [[eschaton]] in a malleable sense, not necessarily meaning final days, or tied to the Apocalypse.&lt;!--p.94--&gt;{{efn|Tooman's view is that the "latter days" means "the end of history-as-we-know-it and the initiation of a new historical age".&lt;!--Tooman, p.96--&gt;}}{{sfn|Tooman|2011|pp=94–97}} Still, the Utopia of chapters 40–48 can be spoken of in the parlance of "true [[eschatology|eschatological]] character, given that it is a product of "cosmic conflict" described in the immediately preceding Gog chapters.{{r|petersen}}

Over the next few centuries Jewish tradition changed Ezekiel's Gog ''from'' Magog into Gog ''and'' Magog.{{r|boring}} The process, and the shifting geography of Gog and Magog, can be traced through the literature of the period. The 3rd book of the [[Sibylline Oracles]], for example, which originated in Egyptian Judaism in the middle of the 2nd century BC,{{r|wardle}} changes Ezekiel's "Gog from Magog" to "Gog and Magog", links their fate with up to eleven other nations, and places them "in the midst of [[Aethiopia]]n rivers"; this seems a strange location, but ancient geography did sometimes place Ethiopia next to Persia or even India.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|pp=142–144}} The passage has a highly uncertain text, with manuscripts varying in their groupings of the letters of the Greek text into words, leading to different readings; one group of manuscripts ("group Y") links them with the "[[Moesia|Marsians]] and [[Dacia]]ns", in eastern Europe, amongst others.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|pp=145–146}}

The [[Book of Jubilees]], from about the same time, makes three references to either Gog or Magog: in the first, Magog is a descendant of Noah, as in Genesis 10; in the second, Gog is a region next to Japheth's borders; and in the third, a portion of Japheth's land is assigned to Magog.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|p=153}} The 1st-century [[Pseudo-Philo|''Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum'']], which retells Biblical history from Adam to Saul, is notable for listing and naming seven of Magog's sons, and mentions his "thousands" of descendants.{{sfn|Bøe|2001|pp=186–189}} The [[Samaritan Torah]] and the [[Septuagint]] (a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible made during the last few centuries of the pre-Christian era) occasionally introduce the name of Gog where the Hebrew original has something else, or use Magog where the Hebrew has Gog, indicating that the names were interchangeable.{{sfn|Lust|1999a|pp=536–537}}

Chapters 19:11–21:8 of the [[Book of Revelation]], dating from the end of the 1st century AD,{{r|stuckenbruck}} tells how [[Satan]] is to be imprisoned for a thousand years, and how, on his release, he will rally "the nations in the four corners of the Earth, Gog and Magog", to a final battle with Christ and his saints:{{r|mounce}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the Earth—Gog and Magog—and to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2020&amp;version=NIV Revelation 20:7–10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Midrashic writings===
After the failure of the anti-Roman [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in the 2nd century AD which looked to a human leader as the promised [[messiah]], Jews began to conceive of the messianic age in supernatural terms: first would come a forerunner, the [[Messiah ben Joseph]], who would defeat Israel's enemies, identified as Gog and Magog, to prepare the way for the [[Jewish messianism|Messiah ben David]];{{Refn|group=lower-alpha|The coming of the Messiah ben David "is contemporary with or just after that of Messiah ben Joseph" (van der Woude (1974), p. 527).{{sfn|Bøe|2001|p=201}}}} then the dead would rise, divine judgement would be handed out, and the righteous would be rewarded.{{r|shengold-jewish-encyclopedia}}{{sfn|Bøe|2001|pp=201–204}}

The [[aggadah]], homiletic and non-legalistic exegetical texts in the [[classical rabbinic literature]] of [[Judaism]], treat Gog and Magog as two names for the same nation who will come against Israel in the final war.{{sfn|Skolnik|Berenbaum|2007|p=684}} The rabbis associated no specific nation or territory with them beyond a location to the north of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikraot Gedolot]] HaMeor p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; but the great Jewish scholar [[Rashi]] identified the Christians as their allies and said God would thwart their plan to kill all Israel.{{r|grossman}}

The 1st-century Jewish historian [[Josephus]] identified the Gog and Magog people as [[Scythians]], horse-riding barbarians from around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and the [[Sea of Azov]]. Josephus recounts the tradition that Gog and Magog were locked up by Alexander the Great behind [[Gates of Alexander|iron gates]] in the "Caspian Mountains", generally identified with the [[Caucasus]] Mountains. This legend must have been current in contemporary Jewish circles by this period, coinciding with the beginning of the Christian Era.{{efn|1=Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D1%3Awhiston%20chapter%3D6%3Awhiston%20section%3D1 1.123] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D18%3Awhiston+chapter%3D4%3Awhiston+section%3D4 18.97]; ''[[The Jewish War]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0148%3Abook%3D7%3Awhiston%20chapter%3D7%3Awhiston%20section%3D4 7.244–51]}}{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=122}} Several centuries later, this material was vastly elaborated in the ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]'' and [[Alexander romance]].{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|pp=122–125}}

===Precursor texts in Syriac===
The ''Pseudo-Methodius'', written originally in Syriac, is considered the source of Gog and Magog tale incorporated into Western versions of the Alexander Romance.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=30}}{{sfn|Stoneman|1991|p=29}} An earlier-dated Syriac ''Alexander Legend'' contains a somewhat different treatment of the Gog and Magog material, which passed into the lost Arabic version,{{sfn|Boyle|1979|p=123}} or the Ethiopic and later Oriental versions of the Alexander romance.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=32}}{{efn|The Ethiopic version derives from the lost Arabic version ({{harvnb|Boyle|1979|p=133}}).

In the Syriac ''Alexander Legend'' dating to 629–630, Gog ({{lang-syr|ܓܘܓ|}}, gwg) and Magog ({{lang-syr|ܡܓܘܓ}}ܵ, mgwg) appear as kings of [[Huns|Hunnish]] nations.{{efn|Also called ''Christian Legend concerning Alexander'', ed. tr. by E. A. Wallis Budge. It has a long full-title, which in shorthand reads "An exploit of Alexander.. how.. he made a gate of iron, and shut it [against] the Huns".}}{{sfn|Budge|1889|loc='''II''', p. 150}} Written by a Christian based in Mesopotamia, the ''Legend'' is considered the first work to connect the Gates with the idea that Gog and Magog are destined to play a role in the apocalypse.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=17}} The legend claims that Alexander carved prophecies on the face of the Gate, marking a date for when these Huns, consisting of 24 nations, will breach the Gate and subjugate the greater part of the world.{{efn|The first invasion, prophesied to occur 826 years after Alexander predicted, has been worked out to fall on 1 October 514; the second invasion on A.D. 629 ({{Harvnb|Boyle|1979|p=124}}).}}{{sfn|Budge|1889|loc='''II''', pp. 153–54}}{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=17–21}}

This idea is also in the Quran {{nowrap|(609–632 CE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chronology of Prophetic Events |author=Fazlur Rehman Shaikh |date=2001 |p=50 |publisher=Ta-Ha Publishers Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LivRlgP338&gt;''Living Religions: An Encyclopaedia of the World's Faiths'', Mary Pat Fisher, 1997, page 338, I.B.

===Alexander romances===

This Gog and Magog legend is not found in earlier versions of the [[Alexander romance]] of Pseudo-Callisthenes, whose oldest manuscript dates to the 3rd century,{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|The oldest manuscript is recension α. The material is not found in the oldest Greek, Latin, Armenian, and Syriac versions.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=17, 21}}}} but an [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolation]] into recensions around the 8th century.{{efn|Recension ε}}{{sfn|Stoneman |1991|pages=28–32}} In the latest and longest Greek version{{efn|Recension γ}} are described the Unclean Nations, which include the Goth and Magoth as their kings, and whose people engage in the habit of eating worms, dogs, human [[cadaver]]s and fetuses.{{sfn|Stoneman|1991|pp=185–187}} They were allied to Belsyrians ([[Bebryces|Bebrykes]],{{sfn|Anderson|1932|p=35}} of [[Bythinia]] in modern-day North [[Turkey]]), and sealed beyond the "Breasts of the North"&lt;!--Μαζοί Βορρά{{sfn|Anderson|1932|p=37}}--&gt;, a pair of mountains fifty days' march away towards the north.{{efn|Alexander's prayer caused the mountains to move nearer, making the pass narrower, facilitating his building his gate. This is the aforementioned element first seen in pseudo-Methodius.}}{{sfn|Stoneman|1991|pp=185–187}}

Gog and Magog appear in somewhat later Old French versions of the romance.{{efn|Gog and Magog being absent in the ''[[Alexandreis]]'' (1080) of [[Walter of Châtillon]].}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=57}} In the verse ''[[Roman d'Alexandre]]'', Branch III, of [[:fr:Lambert le Tort|Lambert le Tort]] (c. 1170), Gog and Magog ("Gos et Margos", "Got et Margot") were vassals to [[Porus]], king of India, providing an auxiliary force of 400,000 men.{{efn|Note the change in loyalties.

{{right|{{small|—[[Thomas de Kent]]'s ''Roman de toute chevalerie'', Paris manuscript, 14th century}}}}]]
Gog and Magog also appear in [[Thomas de Kent]]'s ''Roman de toute chevalerie'' (c. 1180), where they are portrayed as cave-dwellers who consume human flesh. A condensed account occurs in a derivative work, the Middle English ''[[King Alisaunder]]'' (vv. 5938–6287).{{sfn|Anderson|1932|p=88}}{{r|harf-lancner}}{{r|akbari}} In the 13th-century French ''[[Roman d'Alexandre en prose]]'', Alexander has an encounter with cannibals who have taken over the role of Gog and Magog.{{r|warren}} This is a case of imperfect transmission, since the ''prose Alexander'''s source, the Latin work by Archpriest Leo of Naples known as ''Historia de Preliis'', does mention "Gogh et Macgogh", at least in some manuscripts.{{sfn|Michael|1982|p=133}}

==Identification with civilisations==
Early Christian writers (e.g. [[Eusebius]]) frequently identified Gog and Magog with the Romans and their emperor.{{sfn|Lust|1999b|p=375}} After the Empire became Christian, [[Ambrose]] (d. 397) identified Gog with the [[Goths]], [[Jerome]] (d. 420) with the [[Scythians]], and [[Jordanes]] (died c. 555) said that Goths, Scythians and [[Amazons]] were all the same; he also cited Alexander's gates in the Caucasus.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=125}}{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|The idea that Gog and Magog were connected with the Goths was longstanding; in the mid-16th century, Archbishop of Uppsala [[Johannes Magnus]] traced the royal family of [[Sweden]] back to Magog son of Japheth, via Suenno, progenitor of the Swedes, and Gog, ancestor of the Goths).{{r|derry}}}} The [[Byzantine]] writer [[Procopius]] said it was the Huns Alexander had locked out, and a Western monk named Fredegar seems to have Gog and Magog in mind in his description of savage hordes from beyond Alexander's gates who had assisted the Byzantine emperor Heraclius (610–641) against the [[Saracens]].{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|pp=125–126}}

===Nomadic identification===
As one nomadic people followed another on the Eurasian steppes, so the identification of Gog and Magog shifted. In the 9th and 10th centuries these kingdoms were identified by some with the lands of the [[Khazars]], a Turkic people who had converted to Judaism and whose empire dominated Central Asia–the 9th-century monk [[Christian of Stavelot]] referred to Gazari, said of the Khazars that they were "living in the lands of Gog and Magog" and noted that they were "circumcised and observing all [the laws of] Judaism".{{sfn|Brook|2006|pp=7–8, 96}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=65}} Arab traveler ibn Fadlan also reported of this belief, writing around 921 he recorded that "Some hold the opinion that Gog and Magog are the Khazars".{{sfn|Brook|2006|p=8}}

After the Khazars came the [[Mongols]], seen as a mysterious and invincible horde from the east who destroyed Muslim empires and kingdoms in the early 13th century; kings and popes took them for the legendary [[Prester John]], marching to save Christians from the [[Saracens]], but when they entered Poland and Hungary and annihilated Christian armies a terrified Europe concluded that they were "Magogoli", the offspring of Gog and Magog, released from the prison Alexander had constructed for them and heralding [[Armageddon]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=12, 120–122, 144}}

[[Europeans in Medieval China]] reported findings from their travels to the [[Mongol Empire]]. Some accounts and maps began to place the "Caspian Mountains", and Gog and Magog, just outside the [[Great Wall of China]]. The ''[[Tartar Relation]]'', an obscure account of Friar Carpini's 1240s journey to Mongolia, is unique in alleging that these Caspian Mountains in Mongolia, "where the Jews called Gog and Magog by their fellow countrymen are said to have been shut in by Alexander", were moreover purported by the Tartars to be magnetic, causing all iron equipment and weapons to fly off toward the mountains on approach.{{r|painter}} In 1251, the French friar [[André de Longjumeau]] informed his king that the Mongols originated from a desert further east, and an apocalyptic Gog and Magog ("Got and Margoth") people dwelled further beyond, confined by the mountains.{{sfn|William of Rubruck|Rockhill (tr.)|1900|pp=xxi, fn 2}}

In fact, Gog and Magog were held by the Mongol to be their ancestors, at least by some segment of the population. As traveler and Friar [[Riccoldo da Monte di Croce]] put it in c. 1291, "They say themselves that they are descended from Gog and Magog: and on this account they are called ''Mogoli'', as if from a corruption of ''Magogoli''".{{sfn|Boyle|1979|p=126}}{{Sfn|Marco Polo|Yule (tr.)|1875|pp=285, fn 5}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|pp=66–67}} [[Marco Polo]], traveling when the initial terror had subsided, places Gog and Magog among the [[Tartars]] in [[Hohhot|Tenduc]], but then claims that the names Gog and Magog are translations of the place-names Ung and Mungul, inhabited by the Ung and Mongols respectively.{{Sfn|Marco Polo|Yule (tr.)|1875|pp=276–286}}{{r|strickland}}

&lt;!--Even if Gog and Magog were considered ancestors, this location of Gog and Magog seems too far east.--&gt;An explanation offered by Orientalist [[Henry Yule]] was that Marco Polo was only referring to the "Rampart of Gog and Magog", a name for the Great Wall of China.{{sfn|Marco Polo|Yule (tr.)|1875|pp=283, fn 5}} Friar André's placement of Gog and Magog far east of Mongolia has been similarly explained.{{sfn|William of Rubruck|Rockhill (tr.)|1900|pp=xxi, fn 2}}

===The confined Jews===
Some time around the 12th century, the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of Israel came to be identified with Gog and Magog;{{sfn|Gow|1995|pp=23–24}} possibly the first to do so was [[Petrus Comestor]] in ''Historica Scholastica'' (c. 1169–1173),{{sfn|Gow|1995|p=42}}{{sfn|Boyle|1979|p=124}} and he was indeed a far greater influence than others before him, although the idea had been anticipated by the aforementioned Christian of Stavelot, who noted that the Khazhars, to be identified with Gog and Magog, was one of [[Seven chieftains of the Magyars|seven tribes of the Hungarians]] and had converted to Judaism.{{sfn|Brook|2006|pp=7–8, 96}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=65}}

While the confounding Gog and Magog as confined Jews was becoming commonplace, some, like Riccoldo or [[Vincent de Beauvais]] remained skeptics, and distinguished the Lost Tribes from Gog and Magog.{{sfn|Boyle|1979|p=126}}{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=134}}{{sfn|Gow|1995|pp=56–57}} As noted, Riccoldo had reported a Mongol folk-tradition that they were descended from Gog and Magog. He also addressed many minds (Westerners or otherwise{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=66}}) being credulous of the notion that Mongols might be Captive Jews, but after weighing the pros and cons, he concluded this was an open question.{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Riccoldo observed that the Mongol script resembled Chaldean ([[Syriac language|Syriac]],{{Sfn|Marco Polo|Yule (tr.)|1875|pp=58, fn 3}} a form of [[Aramaic]]), and in fact it does derive from Aramaic.{{sfn|Boyle|1979|p=125, note 19}} However, he saw that Mongols bore no physical resemblance to Jews and were ignorant of Jewish laws.}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|pp=66–67}}{{Sfn|Marco Polo|Yule (tr.)|1875|pp=58, fn 3}}

The Flemish Franciscan monk [[William of Rubruck]], who was first-hand witness to Alexander's [[Fortifications of Derbent|supposed wall]] in [[Derbent]] on the shores of the Caspian Sea in 1254,{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Rubruck refers Derbent as the "Iron Gate", this also being the meaning of the Turkish name (Demir kapi) for the town.{{Sfn|William of Rubruck|Rockhill (tr.)|1900|pp=xlvi, 262 note 1}} Rubruck may have been the only medieval Westerner to claim to have seen it.{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=66}}}} identified the people the walls were meant to fend off only vaguely as "wild tribes" or "desert nomads",{{efn|Also "barbarous nations", "savage tribes".}}{{sfn|William of Rubruck|Rockhill (tr.)|1900|pp=xlvi, 100, 120, 122, 130, 262–263 and fn}} but one researcher made the inference Rubruck must have meant Jews,{{efn|Based on Rubruck stating elsewhere "There are other enclosures in which there are Jews"}} and that he was speaking in the context of "Gog and Magog".{{efn|Since [[Roger Bacon]], having been informed by Rubruck, urged the study of geography to discover where the [[Antichrist]] and Gog and Magog might be found.}}{{sfn|Westrem|1998|p=66}} Confined Jews were later to be referred to as "[[Red Jews]]" (''die roten Juden'') in German-speaking areas; a term first used in a [[Holy Grail]] epic dating to the 1270s, in which Gog and Magog were two mountains enclosing these people.{{efn|[[Albrecht von Scharfenberg]], ''Der jüngere Titurel''. It belongs in the [[Arthurian cycle]].}}{{sfn|Gow|1995|pp=70–71}}

The author of the ''[[John Mandeville|Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]'', a 14th-century best-seller, said he had found these Jews in Central Asia where as Gog and Magog they had been imprisoned by Alexander, plotting to escape and join with the Jews of Europe to destroy Christians.{{sfn|Westrem|1998|pp=68–69}}

In the [[Quran]] Surah 18, Yajuj and Majuj (Gog and Magog) are suppressed by Dhul-Qarnayn "the two-horned one", a figure derived ultimately from Alexander the Great.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=57, fn 3}} Dhul-Qarnayn, having journeyed to the ends of the world, meets "a people who scarcely understood a word" who seek his help in building a barrier that will separate them from the people of Yajuj and Majuj who "do great mischief on earth". He agrees to build it for them, but warns that when the time comes (Last Age), Allah will remove the barrier and Yajuj and Majuj will swarm through.&lt;!--{{sfn|Hughes|1895|p=148}}--&gt;{{r|dict-islam}}

The early Muslim traditions were summarised by [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] (d. 1283) in two popular works called the Cosmography and the Geography. Gog and Magog, he says, live near to the sea that encircles the Earth and can be counted only by God; they are only half the height of a normal man, with claws instead of nails and a hairy tail and huge hairy ears which they use as mattress and cover for sleeping.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=65–68}} They scratch at their wall each day until they almost break through. They break for the night saying tomorrow we will finish, and each night God restores it. Then one day, as they stop scratching for the night, one will say tomorrow we will finish God Willing, and in the morning, it is not restored as with everything night. When they do break through they will be so numerous that "their vanguard is in [[Syria]] and their rear in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]".{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=74}}

Various nations and peoples in history were identified as Ya'juj and Ma'juj. At one point, it was the Turks, who threatened [[Baghdad]] and northern Iran;{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=82–84}} later, when the Mongols destroyed Baghdad in 1258, it was they who were Gog and Magog.{{sfn|Filiu|2011|p=30}} The wall dividing them from civilised peoples was normally placed towards [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], but in the year 842 the Caliph Al-Wathiq had a dream in which he saw that it had been breached, and sent an official named Sallam to investigate.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=xvii–xviii, 82}} Sallam returned a little over two years later and reported that he had seen the wall and also the tower where Dhul Qarnayn had left his building equipment, and all was still intact.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=xvii–xviii, 244}} It is not entirely clear what Sallam saw, but he may have reached the [[Jade Gate]], the westernmost customs point on the border of China.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=xvii–xviii}} Somewhat later the 14th-century traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] reported that the wall was sixty days' travel from the city of [[Quanzhou|Zeitun]], which is on the coast of China; the translator notes that Ibn Battuta has confused the [[Great Wall of China]] with that built by [[Dhul-Qarnayn]].{{r|gibb-beckingham}}

It has been narrated from [[Ibn Abbas]] that when he asked [[Ali]] about the "creatures", he responded by saying God has created "1,200 species on the land, 1,200 species in the sea, 70 species from the Children of Adam and the people are the Children of Adam except for the Yajooj and Majooj".&lt;ref name= "Kulayni"&gt;{{cite book |last1=al-Kulayni |first1=Muhammad ibn Ya‘qūb |title=Al-Kafi |date=2015 |publisher=Islamic Seminary Incorporated |location=NY |isbn=9780991430864 |edition=Volume 8 |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern apocalypticism==
In the early 19th century, some [[Hasidic Judaism|Chasidic]] [[rabbi]]s identified the [[French invasion of Russia]] under [[Napoleon]] as "The War of Gog and Magog".{{sfn|Wessels|2013|p=205}} But as the century progressed, apocalyptic expectations receded as the populace in Europe began to adopt an increasingly secular worldview.{{sfn|Kyle|2012|pp=34–35}} This has not been the case in the United States, where a 2002 poll indicated that 59% of Americans believed the events predicted in the Book of Revelation would come to pass.{{sfn|Filiu|2011|p=196}} During the [[Cold War]] the idea that [[Soviet Russia]] had the role of Gog gained popularity, since Ezekiel's words describing him as "prince of Meshek"—''rosh meshek'' in Hebrew—sounded suspiciously like Russia and Moscow.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|1996|p=178}} Even some Russians took up the idea, apparently unconcerned by the implications ("Ancestors were found in the Bible, and that was enough"), as did [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Boyer |first=Paul|title=When Time Shall Be No More: Prophecy Belief in Modern Culture |publisher=Belknap Press |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FyTeW7vQ8K4C&amp;pg=PR1|ref=harv|isbn=9780674028616 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marsh |first=Christopher |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-xlLFUegIBQC&amp;pg=PA254 |title=Religion and the State in Russia and China |publisher=A&amp;C Black |ref=harv|isbn=9781441112477 |page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some post–Cold War [[Millenarianism|millenarians]] still identify Gog with Russia, but they now tend to stress its allies among Islamic nations, especially [[Iran]].{{sfn|Kyle|2012|p=171}} For the most fervent, the countdown to [[Armageddon]] began with the [[Aliyah|return of the Jews to Israel]], followed quickly by further signs pointing to the nearness of the final battle—nuclear weapons, European integration, Israel's seizure of Jerusalem, and America's wars in Afghanistan and the [[Persian Gulf]].{{sfn|Kyle|2012|p=4}} In the prelude to the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]], President [[George W. Bush]] told [[Jacques Chirac]], "Gog and Magog are at work in the Middle East". "This confrontation", he urged the French leader, "is willed by God, who wants to use this conflict to erase His people's enemies before a new age begins".{{r|jean-edward-smith}} Chirac consulted a professor at the Faculty of Theology of the [[University of Lausanne]] to explain Bush's reference.{{sfn|Wessels|2013|pp=193, fn 6}}

In the Islamic apocalyptic tradition, the end of the world would be preceded by the release of Gog and Magog, whose destruction by God in a single night would usher in the Day of Resurrection.{{sfn|Cook|2005|pp=8, 10}} Reinterpretation did not generally continue after Classical times, but the needs of the modern world have produced a new body of apocalyptic literature in which Gog and Magog are identified as Communist Russia and China.{{sfn|Cook|2005|pp=12, 47, 206}} One problem these writers have had to confront is the barrier holding Gog and Magog back, which is not to be found in the modern world: the answer varies, some writers saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are invisible.{{sfn|Cook|2005|pp=205–206}}

'''Prodan Gligorijević''', known simply as '''Hadži-Prodan''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Хаџи-Продан Глигоријевић}}; 1760&amp;ndash;1825) was a Serbian ''voivode'' (military commander) in the [[First Serbian Uprising]] of the [[Serbian Revolution]], then the [[Greek War of Independence]], against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He led an unsuccessful rebellion in 1814, dubbed ''[[Hadži Prodan's Revolt]]''.

==Life==
Prodan Gligorijević was born around 1760, and he hailed from [[Nevade]], near [[Takovo]], modern [[Gornji Milanovac]] (then ''Despotovac''). His epithet, ''[[hajji]]'', derives from honorific title given to Christians that complete the pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]] ([[Jerusalem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apologitis.com/gr/ancient/Ierosolyma.htm|title=Jerusalem and Ancient Temples (in Greek)|publisher=apologitis.com|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the fighting in 1806. Prodan participated in the battles of [[Battle of Sjenica|Sjenica]], [[Battle of Nova Varoš|Nova Varoš]], [[Battle of Prijepolje|Prijepolje]], [[Battle of Bijelo Polje|Bijelo Polje]], and [[Battle of Suvodol|Suvodol]] (1809). After the fall of the uprising ([[Hursid Pasha]] captured [[Belgrade]] in October 1813), his unit stayed in Mučnja for some months. He gave himself up to the Ottomans and settled in the [[Trnava monastery]] in [[Čačak]].

As the Ottoman tyranny continued, he was put to lead the rebellion in the ''[[Požega, Serbia|Požega]] [[nahija]]''. His badly organized rebellion against the Ottomans in the [[Čačak]] region in 1814, known as '''[[Hadži Prodan's Revolt]]''', was quickly beaten. He fled first to [[Austria]] in 1815, then [[Wallachia]], where he joined the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821. He died in 1825.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3541">'''Harragas''' (from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] حراقة, ''ḥarrāga, ḥarrāg'', "those who burn" (the frontier)) are [[North Africa]]n migrants who attempt to [[illegal immigration|illegally immigrate]] to [[Europe]] or to European-controlled islands in makeshift boats.&lt;ref name="wiki"&gt;[[:fr:Harraga]], Retrieved 10 February 2011{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word Harraga (in ar: حراقة), is from Algerian Arabic, designating "those who burn.", meaning those who burn their ID-papers and seek their fortune as asylumseekers in Europe. The Harrga is the action of "burning the borders and the sea."

On the Mediterranean coast of North Africa, Algerian, Tunisian, and Moroccan harragas typically hope to cross the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] in order to reach Spain, specifically the Spanish regions of [[Andalusia]], [[Ceuta]]&lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt; and [[Melilla]].&lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt; Additionally, harragas also sometimes manage to complete the voyage from Africa to the island nation of [[Malta]],&lt;ref name=Magreb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/newsbriefs/general/2009/02/02/newsbrief-03 |title=Maghreb nationals among harragas caught in Malta  |author= |date=2009-02-02 |work= |publisher=United States Africa Command |accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]].&lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt; From here they often go on to emigrate to other regions of Europe.&lt;ref name=Magreb/&gt;

On the Atlantic coast of North Africa, Mauritanian and Senegalese harragas set off in hope of reaching the Spanish-controlled [[Canary Islands]] in small, flat-bottomed boats referred to in Spanish as "patera",&lt;ref name="patera"&gt;[[:es:Patera]], Retrieved 10 February 2011{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in rigid or inflatable rafts, (such as [[Zodiac Marine &amp; Pool|"Zodiac"]] rafts),&lt;ref name="patera"/&gt; or even [[Pedalo|paddle boats]].&lt;ref name="patera"/&gt; Obviously, boats such as these are not designed for ocean crossings and the death rates for harragas are very high. The motivations for undertaking this extremely risky act are twofold: profound economic poverty and extreme political repression, both widespread throughout North Africa.&lt;ref name="wiki"/&gt;

[[Image:Buenos Aires - Esquina Homero Manzi - P2070091.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Drawing depicting Homero Manzi, at the ''Esquina Homero Manzi'', [[Boedo]] neighbourhood.]]
'''Homero Nicolás Manzione Prestera''', better known as '''Homero Manzi''' (November 1, 1907 – May 3, 1951) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[tango music|tango]] lyricist, author of various famous tangos.

He was born on November 1 of 1907 in [[Añatuya]] (province of [[Santiago del Estero]]), Argentina. Manzi was interested in literature and tango since he was young. After a brief incursion in journalism, he worked as a literature and Spanish professor but for political reasons (in addition to his membership in the [[Unión Cívica Radical]]) he was expelled from his professorship and decided to dedicate himself to the arts.

In 1935 he participated in the beginnings of FORJA (Fuerza de Orientación Radical de la Joven Argentina – Force of Radical Orientation of the Young in Argentina), group whose position has been classified as “peoples nationalism”. It was centered almost exclusively in the problems in Argentina and Latin America. They manifested to “reconquer the political Sunday from our own land” since it was considered that the country was still in a colonial situation. In relation to the European conflict at the time, it supported a neutral position sustaining that there was no great interest was in play in Argentina or Latin America, it was more of a rejection position towards fascism just as much as communism.&lt;ref name="Buchrucker258"&gt;{{es icon}} Buchrucker, Cristian, ''Nacionalismo y peronismo'' pág. 258 y 269, 1987, Buenos Aires. Editorial Sudamericana, {{ISBN|950-07-0430-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 Manzi founded ''Micrófono'' ("Microphone") magazine which covered subjects related to radio telephony, Argentine movies and film making. He wrote the screenplay for ''Nobleza Gaucha'' in 1937 in collaboration with [[Hugo Mac Dougall]], and a new version of the silent movie of 1915, ''Huella'' ("Footprint") (1940), for which they received second prize from Buenos Aires City Hall. He also worked in ''Confesión'' ("Confession") (1940), without achieving commercial success with any of these movies.&lt;ref name="Manzi198"&gt;{{es icon}} Salas, Horacio, ''Homero Manzi y su tiempo'' pág. 198, 2001,  Buenos Aires, Javier Vergara editor, {{ISBN|950-15-2244-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 Manzi started what would be a long collaboration with [[Ulyses Petit de Murat]], writing the screenplay for ''Con el dedo en el gatillo'' ("Finger on the trigger") (1940)  ''Fortín alto'' ("High Fort") (1940), and ''[[The Gaucho War]]'' (1942). At the [[1943 Argentine Film Critics Association Awards]], Manzi and Murat won the  [[Silver Condor Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] for their screenplay of  ''The Gaucho War'' which proved highly successful.&lt;ref name="Oliveri1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oliveri|first=Ricardo García|title=Lucas Demare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ykdAQAAIAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Centro Editor de América Latina|language=Spanish|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early death of the poet was caused by cancer on Thursday, May 3, 1951.

'''Inger Edelfeldt''' (born 14{{nbsp}}July 1956) is a Swedish [[author]], [[illustrator]] and translator.

== Personal life ==
Edelfeldt was born in [[Stockholm]] in 1956. Her father was an engineer and her mother was a house wife. Her father user to tell her stories before he went to work in the mornings, but he also suffered from depressions and was treated with [[electrotherapy]]. The situation at home reflected on the young Edelfeldt, she was bullied at school and suffered from self-harming [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]]. As an adult she tried several therapies and finally settled on Zen coaching and meditation.&lt;ref name=dn&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johansson|first1=Astrid|title=Den litterära kameleonten har blivit zen-coach|trans-title=The literary chameleon has become a zen-coach|url=http://www.dn.se/livsstil/intervjuer/den-litterara-kameleonten-har-blivit-zen-coach/|website=www.dn.se|date=3 January 2010|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edelfeldt made her debut in 1977 with the book ''Duktig pojke'' ("Good Boy").&lt;ref name=NE&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johannesson,|first1=Hans-Erik|last2=Littberger Caisou-Rousseau|first2=Inger|title=Inger Edelfeldt|url=http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/lång/inger-edelfeldt|website=www.ne.se|publisher=[[Nationalencyklopedin]]|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel is about the boy Jim who is lonely and asserts himself by excelling in school.

The '''[[Jathedar]] of the Akal Takht''' ({{lang-pa|ਜੱਥੇਦਾਰ ਅਕਾਲ ਤਖ਼ਤ ਸਾਹਿਬ}}), is the appointed head of the [[Akal Takht]] and the [[Sikh]]s of the world. [[Sikh]] clergy consists of five [[Jathedar]]s, one each from five [[Takht (Sikhism)|Takhts]].

Originally known as '''Akal Bunga''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Akal Bunga|url=https://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/architecture/akal-bunga|website=The Sikh Encyclopedia|publisher=Gateway to Sikhism Foundation|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the building directly opposite the [[Golden Temple|Darbar Sahib]] was built by [[Guru Hargobind]] as a place of justice and consideration of temporal issues; the highest seat of earthly authority of the [[Khalsa]] and the place of the [[Jathedar]], the highest spokesman of the Sikhs.

==Selection process==
During the [[18th century|18th]] and [[19th century|19th]] century, Jathedars of Akal Takht were appointed by the [[Sarbat Khalsa]], a biannual [[Mass meeting|deliberative assembly]] of the Sikhs held at [[Amritsar]], [[Punjab region|Punjab]].

From 1921, ''Jathedars'' of Takhts have been appointed by [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC), an elected body of the Sikhs controlled by [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] (SAD), a political party in the state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and an ally of [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP). 

A [[Sarbat Khalsa]] convened by Sikh organisations in 2015 appointed [[Jagtar Singh Hawara]] as the Jathedar of Akal Takht. Ex-SGPC president Avtar Singh Makkar however condemned the convening as against the principles of Sikhism and it's decisions null and void. He added that the removal of Jathedars came under [[Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925]] and no one could challenge the SGPC's authority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/community/at-sarbat-khalsa-hardliners-appoint-hawara-akal-takht-jathedar/156857.html At Sarbat Khalsa, hardliners appoint Hawara Akal Takht Jathedar]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 2009, Muñoz took the male lead of Usnavi in the Broadway cast of ''[[In the Heights]]''.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Kenneth|title=Javier Muñoz Graduates to Star of In the Heights on Feb. 16|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/javier-munoz-graduates-to-star-of-in-the-heights-on-feb.-16-157550|accessdate=August 11, 2015|work=[[Playbill (magazine)|Playbill]]|date=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Usnavi&gt;{{cite news|title=Javier Munoz Brings His 'Usnavi' IN THE HEIGHTS|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Javier-Munoz-Brings-His-Usnavi-IN-THE-HEIGHTS-216-20090216|accessdate=10 November 2015|publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|date=February 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muñoz went on to play Usnavi in the national tour.&lt;ref name=Maupin&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maupin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Broadway series beckons to hipper, younger crowd|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=April 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theater critic Robert Feldberg wrote that he preferred Muñoz in the role originated by Miranda, pointing out that the romance between Usnavi and Vanessa seemed more "believable" and that in putting across the main storyline in a way that Miranda had been unable to do, Muñoz turned the star vehicle into an "emotionally persuasive" ensemble performance.&lt;ref name=Feldberg&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feldberg|first1=Robert|title=Recast puts new spin on 'Heights'|publisher=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]| |location = Bergen County, New Jersey|date=August 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jayasri Burman''' (born 1960 in [[Calcutta]]) is a contemporary Indian artist. She studied at the [[Kala Bhavan]] in Shantiniketan, and at the [[Government College of Art and Craft]], Kolkata, where she completed a [[Master of Arts]] in painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aicongallery.com/artists/jayasri-burman/biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went to Paris and studies print-making under Monsieur Ceizerzi.

She is a member of an [[Template:Burman family|extended family of eminent artists]]: her husband, [[Paresh Maity]]; uncle [[Sakti Burman]] who lives and works in France, though he is considered an Indian artist; and her cousin, [[Maya Burman]]. In 2005, she helped create an exhibition called "The Family" featuring work of all these artists.

Burman works mainly in watercolor, using rich strong hues and bold themes with a mythic element—strange hybrid animals with human heads, female figures. She has won several prizes for her art (which?). Her work has been exhibited in India, and overseas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8015">'''Joel Laverne Slater''' (April 30, 1960 – March 26, 2008) was an American activist who [[renunciation of United States citizenship|renounced his U.S. citizenship]] in 1987 in Australia, voluntarily making himself [[statelessness|stateless]] to protest U.S. foreign policy. The Australian government soon after deported him back to United States, and after six years of fruitless efforts aimed at finding another country to which he could be admitted as a refugee, Slater asked the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] to reverse its earlier recognition of his renunciation, and had his U.S. citizenship restored.

==Renunciation of citizenship==
In December 1987, Slater appeared before the U.S. consul in Perth, Australia and renounced his citizenship; the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] confirmed his renunciation and issued him with a [[Certificate of Loss of Nationality]]. At the time, roughly 300 Americans renounced their citizenship each year, but typically obtained other citizenships. Slater too had plans to marry an Australian woman and eventually obtain [[Australian nationality law|Australian citizenship]] through her, but that fell through, leaving him [[statelessness|stateless]]. Slater's only [[travel document]] was a [[World Passport]] issued by [[Garry Davis]]' [[World Service Authority]].&lt;ref name="Chronicle19910704"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1991_792938/iowan-prefers-to-be-man-without-a-country.html|first=Kim|last=Cobb|title=Iowan prefers to be a man without a country|work=Houston Chronicle|date=1991-07-04|accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MN&amp;p_theme=mn&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EFE480A27C57263&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Man who renounced U.S. citizenship has nowhere to call home|work=Minneapolis Star Tribune|date=1989-07-10|accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that he renounced his citizenship in protest of the [[foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration]], in particular the [[Bombing of Libya (1986)|1986 bombing of Libya]].&lt;ref name="Spectator199304"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmSpectator-1993apr-00072|title=Current Wisdom|work=American Spectator|date=April 1993|page=76|accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was quoted as saying, "I'm sick and tired of the United States. It's like belonging to a country club where you don't like the way the directors are behaving, and you cancel your membership."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/515055301.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+22%2C+1991&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Spectator&amp;desc=Man+without+a+country+renounced+U.S.+citizenship&amp;pqatl=google|title=Man without a country renounced U.S. citizenship|date=1991-10-22|accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travels as a refugee==
Australia deported Slater after his [[United States passport]] was revoked; he was readmitted to the U.S. on a humanitarian [[Parole (United States immigration)|parole]], which he stated that he did not want. Slater then made various attempts to find another country which would admit him for settlement, going back and forth into [[Mexico]] and at one point even hitchhiking across Canada to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and then taking a ferry to the nearby French [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] in an effort to gain admission there. He chose a French territory as a destination because France was a signatory to the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons]]. However, the [[Prefect of Saint Pierre and Miquelon|territorial prefect]] at the time would not permit him to remain. His Canadian lawyer [[Gary Botting]] was quoted as stating that there was a "mini riot ... [s]everal fishermen went on a rampage".&lt;ref name="SeattleTimes19921127"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19921127&amp;slug=1526849|first=Kim|last=Boatman|title=A Man Without A Country, Literally|work=The Seatlle Times|date=1992-11-27|accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to the United States==
Slater returned to the United States, but his earlier work authorization had expired due to his departure, and his [[Social Security Number]] was no longer valid. By March 1991, after his return to the U.S. he was living in an abandoned building near the railroad tracks in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. He expressed interest in going to Norway, but the government there stated that he could not be admitted without a job. The U.S. also refused to issue him a [[refugee travel document]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QUhNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YYIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5864,3122793|title=Man gives up citizenship, without country|work=The Prescott Courier/Associated Press|date=1991-03-18|accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slater referred to his situation as "[[internal exile]]". In 1991, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] stated that Slater could request his citizenship back, but Slater stated that he was not interested.&lt;ref name="Chronicle19910704"/&gt; Despite all his migration difficulties, in a 1992 interview he stated that he had no regrets, comparing his actions to those taken by [[Sons of Liberty]] in the [[Boston Tea Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/1992-11-27/news/26006931_1_sunny-day-citizenship-travel-agent|title=Out of State, Out of Country|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=1992-11-27|accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1992, he was quoted by the ''Santa Barbara News-Press'' as stating that he hoped [[Bill Clinton]] could restore his U.S. citizenship by [[executive order]].&lt;ref name="Spectator199304"/&gt; He regained U.S. citizenship in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/waterloo-courier/1993-03-05/|title=Waterloo man's angry exile comes to an end|work=Waterloo Courier|date=1993-03-05|accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and personal life==
Slater was born in [[Waterloo, Iowa]] to Jerry L. Slater, Sr. and Shirley M. Rodery Slater. He had a sister Debra Slater, a younger brother Jerry L.

'''John Henry "Jack" "Doc" Bradley''' (July 10, 1923 – January 11, 1994) was a [[United States Navy]] [[Hospital corpsman]] who was awarded the [[Navy Cross]] for extraordinary heroism in combat on February 21, 1945 while assigned to a U.S. Marine Corps rifle company during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] in [[World War II]].

Bradley was one of the members of the combat patrol that climbed, captured, and helped raise the original [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flags]] on top of [[Iwo Jima|Mount Suribachi]] on the morning of February 23, 1945.  Until June 2016, Bradley was incorrectly identified as being one of the six men raising a second, larger flag about 90 minutes later, though he was still on the mountaintop and witnessed &amp;ndash; but was not part of &amp;ndash; the specific moment of raising the larger flag that was captured in the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning photo ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]'' taken by [[Associated Press]] photographer [[Joe Rosenthal]].

== Early years ==
John Bradley was born in [[Antigo, Wisconsin]], to James ("Cabbage") and Kathryn Bradley. He was the second eldest of five children. He grew up in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], graduating from [[Appleton West High School|Appleton Senior High School]] in 1941. His younger sister Mary Ellen died of pneumonia at a young age. He  had an interest in entering the funeral business from an early age, because he felt those were the men everyone looked up to, and later got a job at his local funeral home. He then completed an 18-month apprenticeship course with a local funeral director before he entered the U.S Navy during World War II.

== U.S. Navy ==
Bradley enlisted the U.S. Navy on January 13, 1943 when his father suggested it as a way to avoid ground combat. Following his completion of Navy recruit training at the [[Farragut Naval Training Station]] at [[Bayview, Idaho]], he was assigned to the Hospital Corps School at Farragut, Idaho in March 1943. After completing the [[Hospital corpsman]] course, he was assigned to [[Naval Hospital Oakland]] in [[Oakland, California]]. In January 1944, he was assigned to the [[Fleet Marine Force]] and sent to one of the "field medical service schools" at a  Marine Corps base for training to serve with Marines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2gyrene.org/role_corpsman.htm|title=The Navy Hospital Corpsman|publisher=|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing the course, he was assigned to the [[5th Marine Division]] on April 15, a newly activated infantry division which was then being formed at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]], [[California]]. He was reassigned there to Easy Company, [[2nd Battalion, 28th Marines|2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment]] of the division.

=== Battle of Iwo Jima ===

[[James Michels]] (holding [[M1 carbine]]), and Cpl. [[Charles W. Lindberg]] (standing above Michels).]]

On February 19, 1945, the 5th Marine Division which included Bradley took part in the assault on [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] which was one of the most bitterly fought battles of the [[Pacific War]]'s [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island-hopping]] campaign.

Bradley was assigned to Third Platoon, E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines before and when they landed on the beach with the ninth wave of assault Marines at the south end of Iwo Jima near Mount Suribachi. After Bradley and PhM3c. Clifford Langley, the other E Company corpsman assigned to Third Platoon, aided American casualties on the beach, they continued on with E Company as the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines advanced towards Mount Suribachi, which was their objective on the southwest end of the island. On February 21, Bradley risked his life under fire to save the life of a Marine at the base of the mountain who was caught in the open under heavy Japanese fire. While still under and exposed to enemy fire, and in order to save the lives of other Marines who were willing to expose themselves under fire to bring back the wounded Marine, Bradley brought the wounded Marine to safety himself. He was awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] for his actions.

====First flag-raising====
At 8 AM on February 23, Bradley and Navy corpsman, PhM2c. Gerald Ziehme (replaced PhM3c. Langley who was wounded in action on February 21),&lt;ref&gt;Robert Imnie, Associated Press, March 17, 2004: "Veteran closer to clearing his name after book cast doubt on his role at Iwo Jima" {{cite web |url=http://www.legacy.utsandiego.com/news/military/20040317-0049-upsetwwiivet.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222073739/http://www.legacy.utsandiego.com/news/military/20040317-0049-upsetwwiivet.html |archivedate=December 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; were part of the 40-man combat patrol (mostly from Third Platoon, Easy Company) that was sent to climb up the east slope of Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest. E Company's executive officer, First Lieutenant [[Harold G. Schrier|Harold Schrier]] who volunteered to lead the patrol, was to raise an American flag to signal that the mountaintop was captured.

Lt. Schrier and his men reached the top after a small number of Japanese sniper shots, then there was brief skirmish at the rim of the crater. On top, the Marines found a steel pipe to attach the flag unto. The flagstaff was taken to the highest position on the crater. Schrier, Platoon Sgt. [[Ernest Ivy Thomas|Ernest Thomas]] and Sgt. [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]], raised the flag, planting the steel pipe into the ground approximately 10:20 AM.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;[http://ruralfloridaliving.blogspot.com/2012/07/famous-floridian-friday-ernest-ivy.html] Rural Florida Living. CBS Radio interview by Dan Pryor with flag raiser Ernest "Boots" Thomas on February 25, 1945 aboard the [[USS Eldorado (AGC-11)]]: "''Three of us actually raised the flag''"&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the raising of the [[National colours|national colors]] immediately caused loud cheering from the Marines, sailors, and Coast Guardsmen on the beach below and from the men on the ships near the beach. After the flag was raised, Bradley, who was with the group of Marines near the flagstaff, pitched in to help the flagstaff stay vertical in the terrific winds on the volcano.

====Second flag-raising====
[[File:Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima (color).ogg|thumb|right|Sgt. [[William Genaust|Bill Genaust]]'s film shot of the second flag raising excerpted from the 1945 "Carriers Hit Tokyo" newsreel]]
In order for the American flag to be seen more easily from the ships, beaches, and land off and around Mount Suribachi, it was decided that another larger flag should be flown on Mt. Suribachi. Marine Sgt. [[Michael Strank]] a squad leader from Second Platoon, E Company, was ordered to ascend Mount Suribachi with three Marines from his squad and raise the replacement flag. He then ordered Cpl. [[Harlon Block]], Pfc. [[Ira Hayes]], and Pfc. [[Franklin Sousley]] to go with him up Suribachi. Pfc. [[Rene Gagnon]] the company's runner (messenger), was ordered to take the replacement flag up the mountain and return with the first flag that was flying on top.

Once all five Marines were on top, another pipe was found and the replacement flag was attached to it. At approximately 1 PM, Lt. Schrier ordered the raising of the replacement flag and the lowering of the original flag. The flag was raised by Block (misidentified as Sgt. Hansen until January 1947), Gagnon, Hayes, Pfc. [[Harold Schultz]] (misidentified as Bradley until June 23, 2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/05/02/report-marine-corps-investigating-photo-of-iconic-flag-raising-on-iwo-jima/|title=Marine Corps investigating photo of iconic flag-raising on Iwo Jima|website=washingtonpost.com|date=May 2, 2016|first1=Thomas|last1=Gibbons-Neff|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marines.mil"&gt;[http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers], Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/06/23/marines-man-in-iwo-jima-flag-raising-photo-misidentified.html?intcmp=hplnws|title=Marines: Man in Iwo Jima flag raising photo misidentified|date=June 23, 2016|accessdate=June 23, 2016|website=FoxNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sousley and Strank.  Both men originally misidentified as flag raisers had helped raise the earlier flag, and were both still on the mountaintop and witnessed &amp;ndash; but were not part of &amp;ndash; the specific moment of raising the larger flag that was captured in [[Joe Rosenthal]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning photo ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''.

====Subsequent events====

On March 4, Bradley shot a Japanese soldier charging him with a bayonet with his pistol as he treated a wounded Marine in a shell hole.&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt;

On March 12, Bradley and three Marines received [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] wounds from an enemy mortar round explosion. All four were quickly attended to by other corpsmen. Bradley was wounded in the legs and feet and was evacuated from the combat zone to the battalion aid station, field hospital, and was flown to [[Guam]], Hawaii, and [[Naval Hospital Oakland|Oakland Naval Hospital]]. He was awarded the Purple Heart Medal. On March 14, General [[Holland Smith]] ordered an American flag raised at Kitano Point on the northern end of the island, and the flag flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi be taken down. The battle of Iwo Jima was officially over on March 26.

=== Bond-selling tour ===
On March 30, 1945, President Roosevelt ordered that the three flag-raisers in [[Joe Rosenthal]]'s photograph be sent immediately to Washington, D.C. to appear as a public morale factor.&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="navalhistory.org"&gt;[https://www.navalhistory.org/2016/07/01/john-bradleys-account-of-the-iwo-flag-raising] Naval History Blog, US Naval Institute, July 1, 2016, ''John Bradley's Account of the Iwo Flag Raising''. May 9, 1945, US Navy interview of John Bradley&lt;/ref&gt; On April 8, the Marine Corps announced that Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley were the three surviving flag-raisers in the picture and that Sgt. Hansen, Sgt. Strank, and Pfc. Sousley were killed in action. On April 19, Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley's services were requested to participate in the [[Series E bond|Seventh War Loan drive]]. On May 9, a flag-raising by Hayes, Gagnon, and Bradley at the Nation's capital kicked off the bond-selling tour which began on May 11 in New York and ended on July 4 with Gagnon and Bradley's return to Washington, D.C. (Hayes left the bond tour on May 25 after he was ordered back to E Company in Hawaii). The bond tour was held in 33 American cities that raised over $26 billion to help pay for and win the war (the war was over in Europe on May 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bucknell.edu/x36352.xml |title=The Mighty Seventh War Loan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406193329/http://www.bucknell.edu/x36352.xml |archivedate=April 6, 2013|website=bucknell.edu|accessdate=June 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

=== Discharge ===
Bradley was medically discharged from the Navy in November 1945.

== Marriage and family life ==
Bradley married Betty Van Gorp (1924–2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradleyfh.com/obituary/118623/Elizabeth-Bradley/|title=Elizabeth M.  Bradley Online Obituary, January 23, 1924 - September 12, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; settled in Antigo, had eight children, and was active in numerous civic clubs, rarely taking part in ceremonies celebrating the flag-raising &amp;mdash; and by the 1960s avoiding them altogether. He subsequently purchased and managed a funeral parlor.  Bradley's wife later said he was tormented by memories of the war, wept in his sleep for the first four years of their marriage and kept a large knife in a dresser drawer for "protection". He also had flashbacks of his best friend Iggy, [[Ralph Ignatowski]], who was captured and tortured by Japanese soldiers. Bradley could not forgive himself for not being there to try and save his friend's life.&lt;ref name="flags"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=James|last2=Powers|first2=Ron|title=Flags of Our Fathers|year=2000|publisher=Bantam |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marine Corps War Memorial ==
[[File:USMC War Memorial Night.jpg|thumb|right|The [[USMC War Memorial|U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial]] in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]]]]

The Marine Corps War Memorial (also known as the Iwo Jima Memorial) in Arlington, Virginia, which was inspired by Rosenthal's photograph of the second flag-raising on Mount Suribachi was dedicated on November 10, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barracks.marines.mil/History/MarineCorpsWarMemorial.aspx The Marine Corps War Memorial] Marine Barracks Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until June 23, 2016, Bradley was incorrectly depicted on the memorial as the third bronze statue from the base of the flagstaff with the 32-foot (9.8 M) bronze statues of the other five flag-raisers on the monument.&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt; [[Franklin Sousley]] is now depicted as the third bronze statue from the base of the flagstaff ([[Harold Schultz]] in place of Sousley is now depicted as the fifth statue).

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] attended the dedication of the memorial and sat upfront with [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]], [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert B. Anderson|Robert Anderson]], and General [[Lemuel C. Shepherd Jr.]], the 20th [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] of the Marine Corps. Also in attendance were two of the three surviving flag-raisers, Ira Hayes and Rene Gagnon, who were seated together with Bradley (who was incorrectly believed to be a  surviving second flag-raiser)&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt; in the front rows of seats along with relatives of those who were killed in action on the island.&lt;ref name=mhmd&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vgwrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jZoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4987%2C3731941 |newspaper=Reading Eagle|location=Pennsylvania|agency=Associated Press|title=Memorial honoring Marines dedicated |date=November 10, 1954|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speeches were given by Richard Nixon, Robert Anderson who dedicated the memorial, and General Shepherd who presented the memorial to the American people.&lt;ref name=hpdrms&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cPNXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mfYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5563%2C2418577 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=Marine monument seen as symbol of hopes, dreams |date=November 10, 1954 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inscribed on the memorial are the following words:

== Death ==
Bradley had a [[heart attack]], but died of a [[stroke]] at 2:12 am in an Antigo hospital on January 11, 1994, at the age of 70. He is buried in Queen of Peace Cemetery, [[Antigo, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt;

== Flag raising views ==
On June 23, 2016, the Marine Corps announced after reviewing new information in regard to the identities of the six second flag-raisers atop Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945, that Marine Harold Schultz not Bradley is in [[Joe Rosenthal]]'s photograph of the second flag-raising (Franklin Sousley is now where Bradley was thought to be in the photo and Schultz is now where Sousley was in the picture). The Marine Corps stated Bradley was involved with the first flag-raising on Mount Suribachi the same day.&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt; A previous Marine Corps investigation into the identities of the six second flag-raisers was held in December 1946 and January 1947 that determined Marines Michael Strank, Ira Hayes, Franklin Sousley, Rene Gagnon, Harlon Block and Navy corpsman John Bradley were in the photograph, and Marine [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]] was not. Bradley is no longer identified as one of the six flag-raisers on the [[Marine Corps War Memorial]].

On April 3, 1945, Gagnon was the first second flag-raiser ordered to report to Washington, D.C. which he did on April 7, 1945. On April 8, after Gagnon was interviewed by a lieutenant colonel about who the second flag-raisers were, the Marine Corps incorrectly named Bradley (and incorrectly named Hansen) publicly as one of the six flag-raisers. While Bradley was recovering from his wounds at the [[Naval Hospital Oakland]] after the battle, he was shown the famous flag-raising photograph which appeared in the newspapers and was told he was in it. Bradley was then ordered to Washington, D.C. He arrived in Washington on crutches on April 19 as did Ira Hayes. Both men were interviewed by the same lieutenant colonel about who the flag-raisers were in the photograph. Bradley agreed with Gagnon and his naming Hansen and himself as flag-raisers. Hayes also named Bradley, and claimed he told the interviewer in charge who was the same lieutenant colonel, that Harlon Block was in the picture and Hansen was not. The interviewer told Hayes a list of the names of the six flag-raisers were already released publicly and he should stick only with these six names since Block was killed in action (in 1946, the lieutenant colonel denied Hayes ever mentioned Block to him).

On April 20, Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley met Truman at the White House and each showed him their positions in the flag-raising picture. A press conference was also held that day and Gangon, Hayes, and Bradley were questioned about the flag-raising. On May 9, 1945, Bradley did an oral interview for the Navy by a captain about the famous flag-raising on Mount Suribachi, and incorrectly said he was in the second flag-raising picture,&lt;ref name="navalhistory.org"/&gt; and when questioned about the first flag-raising, he said Platoon Sgt. Ernest Thomas raised that flag.&lt;ref name="navalhistory.org"/&gt; In 1985, he did another interview about the flag-raising (second raising) at the urging of his wife, who had told him to do it for the sake of their grandchildren. During that interview, Bradley &lt;ref name="suribachi"/&gt; said that he would not have raised the flag if he had known how famous the photo (Rosenthal photograph) would become.&lt;ref name="suribachi"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradley|first=James|title=Iwo Jima Flag Raising on Mount Suribachi|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Museum}} Viewed March 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that he did not want to live with the pressures of the media and desired to live a normal life.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, James. "Americas Battle: A Speech Given by James Bradley".&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated, during the interview, that anyone on the island could have raised the flag and that he was just there at the right time &lt;ref name="suribachi"/&gt;

Bradley rarely did an interview for the newspapers, he refused to talk to and avoided reporters as much as possible. Throughout his life, the press would contact his home to ask for interviews and he trained his wife and children to give excuses such as he "was on a fishing trip in Canada." Even during the filming of the movie the ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]'' in 1949, Bradley told his wife to tell the townspeople that he was "on a business trip" in order to avoid attention that would be drawn to him."&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt; Despite his reluctance to talk to the media, family, and friends about the incident, he told his parents in a letter a few days after the incident that raising the flag was the "happiest moment of my life",&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt; though he was most likely referring to the first flag raising where he helped secure the flagstaff into the ground after it was raised and planted.&lt;ref name=three/&gt;

Bradley saw the flag raising(s) as an insignificant event in a devastating battle. He rarely talked to people about it and spent most of his life trying to escape the attention he drew from allegedly raising it. He stated once that he "just happened to be there".&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt; He spoke to his wife once about the flag raising during their 47-year marriage. That was on their first date, and he seemed very uninterested with it during the conversation.&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt; His daughter Barbara said that "Reading a book on Iwo Jima at home would have been like reading a playgirl magazine…it would have been something I had to hide."&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt; He told his children more than once that the only real heroes on Iwo Jima were those that did not survive.

His son [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] speculated that his father's determined silence and discomfort on the subject of his role in the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] was largely due to memories of Bradley's wartime buddy, Marine [[Ralph Ignatowski|Ralph "Iggy" Ignatowski]].&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt; In his own words, and only once, he briefly told his son what happened with "Iggy":

{{quote|I have tried so hard to block this out. To forget it. We could choose a buddy to go in with. My buddy was a guy from Milwaukee. We were pinned down in one area. Someone elsewhere fell injured and I ran to help out, and when I came back my buddy was gone. I couldn't figure out where he was. I could see all around, but he wasn't there. And nobody knew where he was. A few days later someone yelled that they'd found his body. They called me over because I was a corpsman. The Japanese had pulled him underground and tortured him. His fingernails... his tongue... It was absolutely terrible. I've tried hard to forget all this.|John Bradley&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt;}} 

Official reports revealed Ignatowski was captured, dragged into a tunnel by Japanese soldiers during the battle, and was later found with his eyes, ears, fingernails, and tongue removed, his teeth smashed, the back of his head caved in, multiple bayonet wounds to the abdomen, and his arms broken.&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt; Bradley's recollections of discovering and taking care of Ignatowski's remains haunted him until his death, and he suffered for many years from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

===Navy Cross citation===
[[File:Navycross.jpg|left|50px]] 
{{quotation|For extraordinary heroism in action against the enemy at Iwo Jima on Feb. 21, 1945 as a hospital corpsman attached to a Marine Rifle platoon. During a furious assault by his company upon a strongly defended enemy zone at the base of Mt. Suribachi, Bradley observed a Marine infantryman fall wounded in an open area under a pounding barrage by mortars, interlaced with a merciless crossfire from Machine guns. With complete disregard for his own safety, he ran through the intense fire to the side of the fallen Marine, examined his wounds and ascertained that an immediate administration of plasma was necessary to save the man's life. Unwilling to subject any of his comrades to the danger to which he had so valiantly exposed himself, he signaled would-be assistants to remain where they were. Placing himself in a position to shield the wounded man, he tied a plasma unit to a rifle planted upright in the sand and continued his life saving mission. The Marine's wounds bandaged and the condition of shock relieved by plasma, Bradley pulled the man thirty yards through intense enemy fire to a position of safety. His indomitable spirit, dauntless initiative, and heroic devotion to duty were an inspiration to those with whom he served and were in keeping with the highest tradition of the United States Naval Service.}}

{{Japanese name|Ishiwara}}
{{nihongo|'''Kanji Ishiwara'''|石原 莞爾|Ishiwara Kanji|extra=18 January 1889 – 15 August 1949}} was a general in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in [[World War II]]. He and [[Itagaki Seishirō]] were the men primarily responsible for the [[Mukden Incident]] that took place in [[Manchuria]] in 1931.

==Early life==
Ishiwara was born in [[Tsuruoka, Yamagata|Tsuruoka City]], [[Yamagata Prefecture]], into a ''[[samurai]]'' class family. His father was a police officer, but as his clan had supported the [[Tokugawa bakufu]] and then the [[Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei|Northern Alliance]] during the [[Boshin War]] of the [[Meiji Restoration]], its members were shut out of higher government positions.

At 13, Ishiwara was enrolled in a military preparatory school. He was subsequently accepted at the 21st class of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] and graduated in 1909. He served in the IJA 65th Infantry Regiment in [[Korea]] after its annexation by Japan in 1910, and in 1915, he passed the exams for admittance to the 30th class of the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army Staff College]]. He graduated second in his class in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ammenthorp | title = The Generals of World War II}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ishiwara spent several years in various staff assignments and then was selected to study in [[Germany]] as a [[military attaché]]. He stayed in [[Berlin]] and in [[Munich]] from 1922 to 1925, focusing on military history and [[military strategy]]. He hired several former officers from the [[German General Staff]] to tutor him, and by the time that he returned to Japan, he had formed a considerable background on military theory and doctrine.

Prior to leaving for Germany, Ishiwara had converted to [[Nichiren Buddhism]]. Nichiren had taught that a period of massive conflict would precede a golden era of human culture in which the truth of [[Buddhism]] would prevail. Japan would be the center and main promulgator of the faith, which would encompass the entire world. Ishiwara felt that the period of world conflict was fast approaching, and Japan, relying upon its vision of the ''[[kokutai]]'' and its sacred mission to "liberate" [[China]], would lead a unified East Asia to defeat the West.&lt;ref name = "Peatty"&gt;{{Citation | last = Peatty | title = Ishiwara Kanji and Japan's confrontation with the West}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ishiwara was also the leader of a semi-religious and Pan-Asianist organization, the East-Asia League Movement (''Tōarenmei undō'').&lt;ref&gt;G. Clinton Godart "Nichirenism, Utopianism, and Modernity Rethinking Ishiwara Kanji's East Asia League Movement" (https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/4456)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kanji Ishiwara2.JPG|273px|thumb|left|[[Army ranks of the Japanese Empire during World War II#Officer ranks|Colonel]] Ishiwara in 1934. At the time he was the commander of the [[4th Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|4th Infantry Regiment]] in [[Sendai]]. ]]

==Ishiwara and Manchuria==
{{main|Mukden Incident}}
Ishiwara was assigned to the Army Staff College as an instructor, followed by a staff position within the [[Kwantung Army]] in [[Manchuria]]. He arrived there at the end of 1928, some months after the assassination of [[Zhang Zuolin]]. Ishiwara quickly realized that the confused political situation in northern China, along with Japan's already significant economic investments in the area, provided the Kwantung Army with a unique opportunity. He and Colonel [[Seishiro Itagaki]] began formulating a plan to take advantage of the situation.

On 18 September 1931, a bomb was secretly planted on the tracks of the Japanese-controlled [[Southern Manchuria Railway]] by Kwantung Army elements. Charging that Chinese soldiers had attacked the rail line, Ishiwara ordered Japanese troops to seize the Chinese military barracks in the nearby city of Liutiaokou. He then ordered Kwantung Army units to seize control of all other Manchurian cities without informing the new commander-in-chief of the Kwantung Army, General [[Shigeru Honjo]], or the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]] in [[Tokyo]].

The sudden invasion of Manchuria alarmed political leaders in Japan, and brought condemnation down on the country from the international community. Ishiwara thought it most likely that he would be executed or at least [[dishonorable discharge|dishonorably discharged]] for his [[insubordination]]. However, the success of the operation brought just the opposite. Ishiwara was admired by right-wing younger officers and [[ultranationalism|ultranationalist]] societies for his daring and initiative. He returned to Japan and was given command of the [[4th Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 4th Infantry Regiment]] in [[Sendai, Miyagi|Sendai]].

==Army revolutionaries==
Ishiwara was appointed to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in 1935 as Chief of Operations, which gave him primary responsibility for articulating his vision for Japan's future. He was a strong proponent of [[pan-Asianism]] and the ''[[hokushin-ron]]'' ("strike north") philosophy, as opposed to the ''[[nanshin-ron]]'' ("strike south") philosophy espoused by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN). The strike north view held that Japan should join with [[Manchukuo]] (the Japanese puppet state created out of occupied Manchuria in 1932) and [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]] to form an "East Asian League", which would then prepare for and fight a war with the [[Soviet Union]]. After the Soviet Union was defeated, Japan could move to the south to free [[Southeast Asia]] from European colonial rule. Following this victory, Japan would then be ready to tackle the [[United States]].&lt;ref name = "Peatty" /&gt;

However, in order to implement these plans, Japan would need to build up its economy and military. Ishiwara envisioned a one-party "national defense state" with a [[command economy]] in which [[political party|political parties]] were abolished and venal politicians and greedy businessmen removed from power.

However, Ishiwara stopped short of calling for a [[Shōwa Restoration]] and violent overthrow of the government. When the [[February 26 Incident]] erupted in 1936, rebels assassinated a number of major politicians and government leaders and demanded a change in government in line with Ishiwara's philosophies. However, Ishiwara dashed their hopes by speaking out strongly against the rebellion and demanding proclamation of [[martial law]]. After Vice Chief of Staff [[Hajime Sugiyama]] pulled troops in from garrisons around Tokyo, Ishiwara was named Operations Officer of the Martial Law Headquarters.

==Return to Manchukuo and disgrace==
In March 1937 Ishiwara was promoted to [[major general]] and transferred back to Manchukuo as Vice Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. He discovered to his dismay that his Army colleagues had no intention of creating a new pan-Asian paradise, and were quite content to play the role of colonial occupiers. Ishiwara denounced the Kwantung Army leadership, and proposed that all officers take a pay cut. He confronted the Kwantung Army commander-in-chief, General [[Hideki Tojo]], over his allocation of funds to an officers' wives club. After becoming an embarrassment to his seniors, he was relieved of command and reassigned to a local army base at [[Maizuru, Kyoto|Maizuru]], on the seacoast near [[Kyoto]].

Back in Japan, he began to analyze Soviet tactics at [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol|Nomonhan]], where Japanese forces were defeated, proposing counter-strategies to be adopted by the Army. He wrote and gave public addresses, continuing to advocate an East Asia League partnership with China and Manchukuo and continuing to oppose the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|invasion of China]]. He became a [[lieutenant general]] in 1939 and was assigned command of the [[IJA 16th Division]].

Ishiwara's political nemesis, Tōjō, now risen to the highest ranks, felt that the outspoken Ishiwara should be retired from the Army, but feared the reactions of young officers and right-wing activists. Finally, after Ishiwara publicly denounced Tōjō as an enemy of Japan who should "be arrested and executed," he was put on the retired list. Ishiwara went back to Yamagata, where he continued to write and study agriculture until the end of the war.

After [[World War II]], the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] called upon Ishiwara as a witness for the defense in the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]]. No charges were ever brought against Ishiwara himself, possibly due to his public opposition to Tōjō, the war in China, and the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. He displayed his old fire in front of the American prosecutor, arguing that U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] should be indicted for the [[Air raids on Japan|mass bombing of Japanese civilians]].&lt;ref&gt;Maga, ''Judgement at Tokyo''&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{In popular culture|date=July 2017}}
Ishiwara is a supporting character in the Japanese [[historical fantasy]] novel ''[[Teito Monogatari]]'' by [[Hiroshi Aramata]].

Ishiwara is a prominent supporting character in the Japanese alternate history [[Zipang (manga)|manga ''Zipang'']] and also the [[Zipang (anime)|anime version]]. His beliefs regarding the clash of civilizations between the East and the West, involvement in the Manchurian incident, views on Pan-Asianism, and perspectives on World War II form important parts of the plot.

[[Murakami Haruki]], in the novel ''[[The Wind-up Bird Chronicle]]'', also refers to Ishiwara as his strategic concept.

'''Khem Singh Bedi''' [[Order of the Indian Empire|KCIE]] (21 February 1832{{snd}}10 April 1905) claims he was a direct descendant of [[Guru Nanak]], a leader, founder of the Singh Sabha in 1873, and a [[Sanatan Sikh]] who believed there were no essential differences between Sikhs and Hindus.&lt;ref name="FenechMcLeod2014p183"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis E. Fenech|author2=W. H. McLeod|title=Historical Dictionary of Sikhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xajcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183|year=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4422-3601-1|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; It instituted many charitable causes for Sikhs, was a landowner and politician in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] during the [[British Raj]].

==Life==
Bedi was born in [[Kallar Syedan]] in the [[Rawalpindi District]] in 1832. He was said to be the thirteenth direct descendant of [[Guru Nanak Dev]], the founder of [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bobby Singh Bansal, Remnants of the Sikh Empire: Historical Sikh Monuments in India &amp; Pakistan, Hay House, Inc, 1 Dec 2015&lt;/ref&gt; His father Baba Attar Singh was killed in a family feud on 25 November 1839 and Bedi and his elder brother Sampuran Singh inherited [[jagir|jagirs]] in the [[Doaba]] region along with 41 villages in [[Depalpur Tehsil]]. Following the annexation of the Punjab by the [[East India Company]] in 1849, 14 of those villages were appropriated by the new administration.&lt;ref&gt;Harbans Singh, The Encyclopaedia of the Sikhism Volume, Punjabi University Patiala&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, the Punjab administration established the Department of Public Instruction with the aim to open 30 single-teacher primary schools across the Punjab. Bedi lent his full support to the scheme, additionally opening his own schools in Rawalpindi. At least fifty schools for boys and girls were opened in the Punjab with his assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Harbans Singh, The Encyclopaedia of the Sikhism Volume, Punjabi University Patiala&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Indian Mutiny of 1857]], Bedi helped British troops quell an uprising in [[Gugera]].&lt;ref&gt;Harbans Singh, The Encyclopaedia of the Sikhism Volume, Punjabi University Patiala&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguished himself in a cavalry charge on 21 September 1857, and the following day narrowly escaped an ambush which killed the Extra Assistant Commissioner of Gogera, Leopold Fitzhardinge Berkeley. Following the rebellion, he was given a robe of honour and a double barrelled rifle.&lt;ref&gt;Harbans Singh, The Encyclopaedia of the Sikhism Volume, Punjabi University Patiala&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 1 October 1873 he co-founded the [[Singh Sabha Movement]] in response to growing [[Christian]], [[Islam]], [[Arya Samaj]] and [[Brahmo Samaj]] proselytising in the Punjab region. The movement aimed to re-capture the original message of the Gurus and re-establish Sikh identity. It sought to address issues of personal identity, formulate theoretical concepts, reform social customs and give prominence to the [[Punjabi language]] in the Gurmukhi script of the Gurus.&lt;ref&gt;Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh, Sikhism: An Introduction, I.B.Tauris, 15 Mar 2011, p145&lt;/ref&gt; Within a decade 121 separate Singh Sabhas had emerged across the region.&lt;ref&gt;Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh, Sikhism: An Introduction, I.B.Tauris, 15 Mar 2011, p145&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed a magistrate in 1877 and made a [[Order of the Indian Empire|Companion of the Indian Empire]] in 1879. On the occasion of his daughter's marriage in 1893, he donated Rs 3,00,000 for religious and charitable purposes.

'''Kuki Gallmann''' ({{IPA-it|ˈkuː.ki ɡaːlˈman}}) (born June 1, 1943) is an Italian-born [[Kenya]]n national, best-selling author, poet, environmental activist, and conservationist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/jun/18/who-shot-kuki-gallmann-the-story-of-a-kenyan-conservationist-heroine Who shot Kuki Gallmann? The story of a Kenyan conservationist heroine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
The daughter of Italian climber and writer [[:it: Cino Boccazzi| Cino Boccazzi]], in 1972 she moved to Kenya with her husband Paolo and son Emanuele. They acquired Ol ari Nyiro, a {{convert|98,000|acre|km2}} cattle ranch in Western Laikipia, in Kenya's [[Great Rift Valley]] which she would later transform into a conservation park. Both her husband and son died in accidents within a few years.

Kuki decided to stay in Kenya and to work toward ecological conservation in the early '80s, becoming a Kenyan citizen. As a living memorial to Paolo and Emanuele, she established the Gallmann Memorial Foundation (GMF), which promotes coexistence of people and nature in Africa and is active in education, biodiversity research, habitat protection, reforestation, community service, peace and reconciliation, poverty alleviation and public health. GMF promotes environmental education of Kenyan students. She dedicated Ol ari Nyiro to this ideal, converting it into the Laikipia Nature Conservancy.

Gallmann has published five books, all global best-sellers. The first, her autobiography ''[[I Dreamed of Africa (book)|I Dreamed Of Africa]]'', became a [[I Dreamed of Africa|feature film]] starring [[Kim Basinger]] and has been published in 24 countries and translated in 21 languages. Her other books are: African Nights, Il Colore del Vento, Night of the Lions, Elefanti in Giardino.

==Humanitarian and environmental work==
To bring attention to major environmental topics through art, in 2006 she founded the Great Rift Valley Trust together with her daughter Sveva and other Kenyan personalities. The Trust invites artists to create original fusion art with Kenyan 'slum' artists at the Laikipia Nature Conservancy. The Trust also co-produces the Laikipia Highlands Games, sports for peace, and the Earth Festival to help the environment.

In 2008, after Kenya's post-election violence, she founded the Laikipia Highlands Games (Sport for Peace) to put together, through peaceful but challenging competition of sports, youth across the ethnic, tribal and political divide. The LHG won for Kenya the 2009 Event of Year World Award by the [[Peace and Sport]] Foundation in [[Monaco]]. The LHG promotes peace through sports amongst previously warring tribes.

In 2010 she founded Prayers for the Earth, to involve local tribal elders and youth to recapture the traditional respect for the environment on which their livelihood depends, and reconnect to the Earth through traditional worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shinnyoen.org/news/news-moto-maji-shinnyo-fire.html |title=Moto Na Maji: Shinnyo Fire and Water Ceremony in Kenya - Shinnyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, with her daughter, she acquired and donated 300 acres for a model community project called "Land of Hope" in Laikipia West, which aims to benefit impoverished communities of the area. With support from Maisha Marefu, an Italian Onlus, the project was brought to life: a vocational centre for women and youth, a nursery school and feeding programme, a dispensary, and a high altitude athletics training centre are part of the scheme. This last athletics centre, in partnership with Martin Keino, of Keino Sports Marketing, was completed in 2013.

Sveva, her daughter, holds an MSc in Human Sciences from [[New College, Oxford]] and coordinates the award-winning 4 Generations Project, an educational scheme to proactively protect local endangered cultures, by bridging the inter-generational gap. Sveva is also leading several art projects and community projects amongst local tribes to promote peace and improve their living standards.

Despite these circumstances, Kuki succeeded in maintaining Ol Ari Nyiro as a largely untainted reserve of scientific and cultural value. This is witnessed by the recognition of several important accreditations to Ol Ari Nyiro, including being recognized as a “Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot”, as one of UNEP World Designated Protected Areas (WDPA), and being officially declared an Important Bird Area (IBA) an area recognized as being globally important habitat for the conservation of birds populations, and as a KEY BIODIVERSITY AREA (KBA number 064)  through
Nature Kenya and Birdlife International, a status recognized by the IUCN with the following definition: &amp;quot;Key biodiversity areas are places of international importance for the conservation of biodiversity through protected areas and other governance mechanisms.&amp;quot; Additionally, since 2015 Ol Ari Nyiro is part of Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association (KWCA 087). Not only is the Conservancy an area of outstanding natural beauty, but also, as a result of the
protection that has benefited for over forty years under Kuki’s guardianship, the natural springs were preserved and Ol Ari Nyiro now serves as the Water Tower for the Great Rift Valley Lakes. The Mukutan Gorge was defined by Professor Truman Young as “the most varied botanically non forested area in East Africa”

==Gallmann Memorial Foundation==
The Foundation proves that Africa can survive out of the ecological, creative and sustainable use of its natural resources. She transformed Ol ari Nyiro into a Nature Conservancy (LNC)  managed holistically after selling the livestock. Due to relentless protection, Laikipia Nature Conservancy is a biodiversity oasis that supports and protects an extraordinary variety of plants and animals, the only pristine forest in the area, which includes endangered species such as elephants, cheetah, over 470 species of birds and rare and endemic plants and insects, in addition to archaeological sites.

[[Lewis Hamilton]] is a British five-time [[Formula One]] [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|world champion]]. He entered Formula One in [[2007 Formula One World Championship|2007]] with [[McLaren]], initially partnering with double world champion [[Fernando Alonso]]. He spent 6 years with McLaren before moving to his present team Mercedes in 2013. Hamilton won his first race in [[2007 Canadian Grand Prix]] from his first pole position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/f1/motorsport/race/2162.html?|title=2007 Canadian Grand Prix results|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he took 3 more race victories during the course of the 2007 season, before coming up short in the fight for overall honours to [[Kimi Räikkönen]] by a single point in his debut season. Hamilton then won his first world title  by a single point in [[2008 Formula One World Championship|2008]], beating [[Felipe Massa]] by overtaking Timo Glock to finish 5th on the last corner of the last lap of the [[2008 Brazilian Grand Prix|final race]].

Hamilton took a total of 21 victories across six seasons with McLaren, partnering [[Heikki Kovalainen]] in [[2008 Formula One World Championship|2008]] and [[2009 Formula One World Championship|2009]], and fellow world champion [[Jenson Button]] from [[2010 Formula One World Championship|2010]] to [[2012 Formula One World Championship|2012]]. His move to Mercedes at the start of [[2013 Formula One World Championship|2013]] season was controversial, but has proven indisputably successful. Driving for Mercedes, he has so far accumulated a further 52 victories and a further 4 championship titles ([[2014 Formula One World Championship|2014]], [[2015 Formula One World Championship|2015]], [[2017 Formula One World Championship|2017]] and [[2018 Formula One World Championship|2018]]). 

Hamilton remains the only driver in history to have won at least one race in every season contended. Moreover, his {{F1stat|HAM|wins}} Grand Prix victories is the second highest of all-time, behind only [[Michael Schumacher]]'s total of 91. His most successful circuits are [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]] and [[Hungaroring]] where he has won six times. Hamilton's largest margin of victory was at the [[2008 British Grand Prix]], a race in which he lapped the field, bar the other 2 podium finishes, and the smallest margin of victory was at the [[2016 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix]] when he backed up the pack as he beat teammate [[Nico Rosberg]] by 0.439 seconds in the race, but placed runner up to Rosberg in the 2016 World Drivers' Championship.

'''Mary Walcott''' was one of the "afflicted" girls called as a witness at the [[Salem witch trials]] in early 1692-93.

==Life==
Born July 5, 1675, she was the daughter of Captain Jonathan Walcott (1639–1699), and his wife, Mary Sibley (or Sibly; 1644–1683), both of Salem, and was about seventeen years old when the allegations started in 1692. Her aunt, Mary (née Wolcott), the wife of Samuel Sibley (or Sibly; 1657–1708), was the person who first showed [[Tituba]] and Tituba's husband [[John Indian]] how to bake a "witch cake" to feed to a dog in order that she and her friends might ascertain exactly who it was that was afflicting them. Joseph B. Felt quoted in ''The Annals of Salem'' (1849 edition) vol. 2, p.&amp;nbsp;476 [from the town records]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;March 11, 1692 &amp;ndash; "Mary, the wife of Samuel Sibley, having been suspended from communion with the church there, for the advices she gave John [husband of Tituba] to make the above experiment, is restored on confession that her purpose was innocent."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Marriage==
Mary Walcott married Isaac Farrar, son of John Farrar of [[Woburn, Massachusetts]], on April 28, 1696. They had several children, and eventually moved to [[Townsend (town), Massachusetts|Townsend, Massachusetts]]. She married, secondly, to David Harwood in 1701 in [[Sutton, Massachusetts]]. They had nine children:

# Mary Harwood, b. Abt. 1702.; d. Abt. 1753. 
# Emma Harwood, b. Abt. 1705. (m. Ebenezer Macintyre, May 23, 1728). 
# Hannah Harwood, b. Abt. 1706; (m. Ebenezer Twiss, Abt. 1752). 
# David Harwood, b. Abt. 1708, Salem, Essex County, Massachusetts; d. August 22, 1781, Sutton, Worcester County, Massachusetts; (m. Margaret Cox, March 13, 1730/31, Salem, Essex Cnty, Massachusetts). 
# Elizabeth Harwood, b. Abt. 1711; d. Abt. 1738; (m. Benjamin Moulton, October 1734). 
# Ezra Harwood, b. Abt. 1715. 
# Alice Harwood, b. Abt. 1720, Salem, Massachusetts (m. Jonathan Nourse Jr., August 12, 1743). 
# Absalom Harwood, b. Abt. 1723; (m. Anna Boyce, September 23, 1748). 
# Solomon Harwood, b. Abt. 1725; (m. Abagail Phelps, December 20, 1748; m. Sarah Taylor December 4, 1752).

==Later years==
They moved to [[Sutton, Massachusetts|Sutton]] about 1729, leaving most of their children living in Salem. David was a weaver by occupation. David died before 1744. Mary Walcott Harwood probably died before 1752.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. and International Marriage Records, 1560-1900&lt;br/&gt;Record Name: Mary Wolcott&lt;br/&gt;Gender: Female&lt;br/&gt;Birth Place: MA&lt;br/&gt;Birth Year: 1675&lt;br/&gt;Spouse Name: David Harwood&lt;br/&gt;Marriage Year: 1701&lt;br/&gt;Number Pages: 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kas-tziden''' ("Broken Foot") or '''Haškɛnadɨltla''' ("Angry, He is Agitated"), more widely known by his Mexican-Spanish appellation '''Nana''' ("grandma" or "lullaby") (1800? – May 19, 1896), was a [[warrior]] and [[tribal chief|chief]] of the [[Chiricahua#Bands|Chihenne]] band (better known as ''Warm Springs Apache'') of the [[Chiricahua]] [[Apache]]. In the 1850s and 1860s he was one of the best known leaders of the Bedonkohe and Chihenne, along with [[Delgadito (Apache chief)|Tudeevia]] (''Dudeevia'', better known as ''Delgadito'' - "Little Thin", "Skinny"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortsillapache-nsn.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=5&amp;layout=blog&amp;Itemid=7 Fort Sill Apache Tribal Leaders]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuchillo Negro]], [[Ponce (Apache)|Ponce]] and [[Loco (Apache)|Loco]] ("crazy", "mad"). He was a nephew of Delgadito, and married a sister of [[Geronimo]].

==Description==
Captain [[John Gregory Bourke]] described Nana as having "a strong face marked with intelligence, courage and good nature, but with an under stratum of cruelty and vindictiveness".&lt;ref name="Bourke1886"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourke|first=John Gregory|title=An Apache Campaign in the Sierra Madre: An Account of the Expedition in Pursuit of the Hostile Chiricahua Apaches in the Spring of 1883|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OcNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA99|year=1886|publisher=C. Scribner's sons|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Fletcher Lummis]] claimed that Nana wore gold watch chains in each ear lobe, presumably taken from dead victims.&lt;ref name="Hodge1912"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodge|first=Frederick Webb|title=Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico: N-Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9c_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA19|year=1912|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lummis1893"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lummis|first=Charles Fletcher|title=Land of Poco Tiempo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gy5DAAAAIAAJ|year=1893|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Fights ==
He fought alongside [[Mangas Coloradas]] and his mixed Tchihende-[[Chiricahua#Bands|Bedonkohe]] band until Mangas Coloradas was killed while in the custody of the [[California Column]] in January 1863. In [[Mexico]] he undertook many joint raids with the [[Chiricahua#Bands|Nednhi]] of [[Juh]] and [[Natiza]] against the Mexicans. After Ponce, Cuchillo Negro and Delgadito were killed too, [[Victorio]] took over the Tchihende leadership, joined by the leaderless Bedonkohe (Taklishim, old Mahko's son, had not been able to save his father's leadership in front of his competitors Mano Mocha and Luis). Nana, although at least 20 years older than Victorio, married the latter's elder sister, cementing his position as a leader.&lt;ref name="Hutton2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Paul Andrew|title=The Apache Wars: The Hunt for Geronimo, the Apache Kid, and the Captive Boy Who Started the Longest War in American History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=td5UCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA290|date=3 May 2016|publisher=Crown/Archetype|isbn=978-0-7704-3582-0|pages=44, 60, 276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Victorio's War ==
After several failed attempts to peacefully live on a reservation in their own country, Victorio and Nana gave up trying and fought back against the Americans and Mexicans. The Bedonkohe and Chihenne were joined by more than 80 warriors of the [[Mescalero|Mescalero Apache]] under their old chief Caballero.  Victorio and Nana therefore had about 200 warriors.&lt;ref name="Roberts1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=David|title=Once They Moved Like The Wind: Cochise, Geronimo, And The Apache Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VhDJ4Or38I8C|date=19 July 1994|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-88556-4|pages=190–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Apache Wars]] and especially [[Victorio's War]] Nana raided areas of Texas and Mexico with [[Victorio]]. While Nana and a small group was away on a scouting mission, Victorio and his band were surrounded and killed by soldiers of the Mexican Army under Joaquin Terrazas at the [[Battle of Tres Castillos]] in October 1880. 68 women and children were captured by the Mexicans and sold as slaves in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Roberts1994"/&gt;

== Nana's Raids ==
After Victorio's death, Nana and his followers hid in the Sierra Madre. Several prestigious leaders and warriors, such as [[Fun (Apache)|Fun]] (''Yiy-gholl'', ''Yiy-joll'', ''Yiy-zholl'', also known as ''Larry Fun''), [[Ka-ya-ten-nae]] (''Ka-e-te-nay'', ''Kadhateni'' or ''Kieta'' - "Fights Without Arrows", "Cartridges All Gone") took the leadership of the Tchihende, Bedonkohe, [[Chiricahua#Bands|Tsokanende]] and Nednhi bands beside the already established Apache band leaders Nana, Loco, Mangas, [[Naiche]], Geronimo and Juh.

Nana, now almost 80 years old (according to some reports, nearly 90-years), formed his own war party with the Chihenne (Warm Springs Apache), enlisting loitering warriors in the reservations. His band joined by 15 Tsokanende, 12 Mescalero warriors and a couple of Navajo, plus women and children, began raiding Army supply trains and isolated settlers. In less than a month Nana fought seven or eight battles stretching over the course of 1,000 miles and killed 30-40 Americans, at least as many Mexicans, captured about 200 horses to replace 100 ridden to death and then fled back to Mexico.&lt;ref name="Sweeney2012"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sweeney, Edwin R.| title=From Chochise to Geronimo: The Chiricahua Apaches 1874-1886 | location=Norman, OK| publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2012 | ISBN=978-0-8061-4272-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|174–177}} He and his small force, evaded more than 1,000 soldiers, 300-400 civilian militia volunteers and Apache and Navajo Indian Scouts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dchieftain.com/news/42295-07-03-04.html Nana's Raid — Apaches in Socorro County] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215120851/http://dchieftain.com/news/42295-07-03-04.html |date=2009-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lekson1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lekson|first=Stephen H.|title=Nana's Raid: Apache Warfare in Southern New Mexico, 1881|year=1987|publisher=Texas Western Press, University of Texas at El Paso|isbn=978-0-87404-159-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wellman1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wellman|first=Paul Iselin|title=Death in the Desert: The Fifty Years' War for the Great Southwest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5MM7isgtoUC&amp;pg=PA195|date=January 1987|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-9722-X|pages=195–205|chapter=The Raid of Old Nana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nana's Death ==
Nana survived the Apache Wars. Upon surrender in March 1886 he, other Apache warriors and [[Apache Scouts]] were sent as prisoners of war to Florida and Alabama.&lt;ref name="Watt2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Watt|first=Robert|title=Apache Tactics 1830–86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3eC6CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|date=20 January 2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-84908-631-8|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1894, they were relocated to [[Fort Sill]] in the Indian Territory, present-day Oklahoma.

== Legacy ==
Nana has a special reputation among Apache war chiefs. He was still an active warrior well into his eighties. He had tenacity, stamina, courage and an uncanny ability to improvise in a fight to minimize his losses. He showed no mercy in battle, yet could be considerate when dealing with civilians.&lt;ref name="Sweeney2012" /&gt;{{rp|174–175}} When Nana was executing guerrilla tactics in the 1880's, he was half blind, crooked from arthritis, but once he sat in the saddle, he rode "like the devil." &lt;ref name="Roberts1994"/&gt;

She holds a bachelor's degree in physics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], a doctorate in astrophysics from [[UC Santa Cruz]], and completed a post-doctoral fellowship in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.&lt;ref name="AMES-bio"/&gt;

==Career==

In 1997, [[William Borucki]] added Batalha to the science team and she started work on transit photometry. She has been involved with the Kepler Mission since the design and funding, and as one of the original Co-Investigators was responsible for the selection of the more than 150,000 stars monitored by the telescope. She now works closely with team members at Ames Research Center to identify viable planets from the data of the Kepler mission. She led the analysis that yielded the discovery in 2011 of [[Kepler 10b]], the first confirmed rocky planet outside our solar system.&lt;ref name="Lemonick-2012"/&gt;

In 2017, Batalha and two other exoplanet scientists were named to Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World.&lt;ref name="Stern-2017"/&gt;

In 2017, Batalha won Smithsonian Magazine's American Ingenuity Award in Physical Sciences.&lt;ref name="Ingenuity Awards"&gt;{{cite web |title=2017 American Ingenuity Award Winners |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/ingenuity/ceremonies/2017-winners/ |website=Smithsonian Magazine |publisher=Smithsonian |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peter_Underwood,_parapsychologist,_paranormal_historian,_ghost_hunter.jpg|thumb|right|Peter Underwood]]

'''Peter Underwood''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSA}} (16 May 1923 – 26 November 2014) was an English [[author]], [[Television presenter|broadcaster]] and [[Parapsychology|parapsychologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Michael|title=Peter Underwood obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/17/peter-underwood|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 December 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Underwood was born in [[Letchworth]], [[Hertfordshire]]. Described as "an indefatigable [[ghost hunting|ghost hunter]]", he wrote many books which surveyed alleged [[haunting]]s within the United Kingdom - beginning the trend of comprehensive regional 'guides' to (purportedly) haunted places. One of his well-known investigations concerned [[Borley Rectory]], which he also wrote about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Underwood - obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11310318/Peter-Underwood-obituary.html|website=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2 December 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born into a family who were [[Plymouth Brethren]], Underwood had his first paranormal experience at the age of nine, when he claimed to have seen an apparition of his father, who had died earlier the same day, standing at the bottom of his bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = No Common Task|last = Underwood|first = Peter|publisher = Harrap|year = 1983|isbn = 024553959X|location = London|pages = 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his childhood, his maternal grandparents lived for a time at Rosehall, a seventeenth century Hertfordshire house which it was claimed was haunted, supposedly having a bedroom in which guests claimed to have seen the figure of a headless man.  Underwood's interest in hauntings and psychic matters began to take root at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Profile of Peter Underwood: {{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Paul|title=Harry Price Website|url=http://www.harrypricewebsite.co.uk/Profiles/peterunderwood.htm|accessdate=2 December 2015}}; see also the first chapter of {{Cite book|title = No Common Task|last = Underwood|first = Peter|publisher = Harrap|year = 1983|isbn = 024553959X|location = London|pages = 13–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the [[Second World War]], Underwood joined the publishing firm of [[J.M. Dent &amp; Sons]] in [[Letchworth Garden City]]. In January 1942 he was called up for active service with the [[Suffolk Regiment]].  After collapsing at a rifle range at [[Bury St Edmunds]], Underwood was diagnosed with a serious chest ailment which rendered him unfit for active service. He was discharged from the army and returned to Dents.  On 15 July 1944 Underwood married his wife Joyce at [[Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Baldock|St. Mary's Church]] in nearby [[Baldock]] (she died in 2003 after having suffered with [[Parkinson's Disease]] for 14 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = No Common Task|last = Underwood|first = Peter|publisher = Harrap|year = 1983|isbn = 024553959X|location = London|page = 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwood was much influenced by the work of [[Harry Price]] - the grandfather of ghost-hunting - and was particularly struck by Price's ‘The End of Borley Rectory’, which he read immediately when it was first published in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/No-Common-Task-Autobiography-Hunter/dp/024553959X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1476118912&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=no+common+task|title=No Common Task: Autobiography of a Ghost Hunter|last=Underwood|first=Peter|date=1983|publisher=George G.Harrap &amp; Co Ltd|year=|isbn=9780245539596|edition=1st|location=London|pages=45|language=English|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigating Borley himself, he corresponded with Price about it. Price then invited Underwood to join the Ghost Club , of which he would later become President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Borley-Rectory-Companion-Paul-Adams/dp/0750950676/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1476119098&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=borley+rectory+companion|title=The Borley Rectory Companion|last=Adams|first=Paul|last2=Underwood|first2=Peter|last3=Brazil|first3=Eddie|date=2009|publisher=The History Press|year=|isbn=9780750950671|edition=1st|location=Stroud|pages=300|language=English|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigating the Paranormal==
During his investigations into the [[Borley Rectory]] case, over a period of years, Underwood traced and personally interviewed almost every living person who had been connected with what the press had dubbed the 'most haunted house in England'. He built up a volume of correspondence with paranormal investigator [[Harry Price]] and after Price's death, [[Paul Tabori]] would become literary executor of the Harry Price Estate, with whom Underwood worked with to publish all his research into Borley. (Price had written published two books about Borley- ''The Most Haunted House in England'' (1940), and ''The End of Borley Rectory'' (1946), from which Underwood 'compile[d] a really comprehensive index of the combined volumes'.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = No Common Task|last = Underwood|first = Peter|publisher = Harrap|year = 1983|isbn = 024553959X|location = London|pages = 187; 70–71}}; {{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Harry|title=The Most Haunted House in England: Ten Years Investigation of Borley Rectory|date=1940|publisher=Longman's Green}}; {{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Harry|title=The End of Borley Rectory - The Most Haunted House in England|date=1946|publisher=Harrap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwood's published work changed the field of literature on the paranormal. For example, his much imitated ''Gazetteer of British Ghosts'' (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909941,00.html|title=Modern Living: The Great Ghost Haunts|date=1971-08-30|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karpeles|first=Maud|last2=Smith|first2=A.

They also encouraged others to use them as resources to use to visit the sites he investigated for themselves. Underwood came to be known as a 'veteran psychical researcher ... representing the middle-ground between scepticism and uncritical belief'; the 'Sherlock Holmes of psychical research' - as [[Dame Jean Conan Doyle]] would say (when introducing him).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drury|first1=Nevill|title=The Dictionary of the Esoteric|date=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=8120819896|page=315}}; {{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Michael|title=Haunted North Cornwall|date=2014|publisher=The History Press|isbn=0750954396|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Underwood; "My Friend Dame Jean Conan Doyle"; pp.128-131; The Shoso-in Bulletin of Japan, Volume 12, 2002, Edited by Hirayama Yuichi &amp; Mel Hughes (Sherlock Holmes Journal) http://shoso.ninja-web.net/Shoso-inBulletin/vol.12.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book ''Ghosts of Borley'' (1973), Underwood and [[Paul Tabori]] wrote that they believed "some of the phenomena were genuine" at the [[Borley Rectory]].&lt;ref name="Hall 1985"&gt;[[Trevor H. Hall|Hall, Trevor H]]. (1985). ''A Note on Borley Rectory: The Most Haunted House in England''. In [[Paul Kurtz]]. ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researcher [[Trevor H. Hall]] criticized Tabori and Underwood for [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|selective reporting]]. According to Hall, the alleged paranormal phenomena from the rectory were the result of natural causes, such as noises produced by [[rat]]s or flying bats, pranks by local village boys throwing stones at the house, or [[tramp]]s trying to keep warm by lighting small [[fire]]s in the rectory.&lt;ref name="Hall 1985"/&gt;

In his book ''No Common Task: The Autobiography of a Ghost-Hunter'' (1983), Underwood came to the conclusion after years of investigation that 98% of the reports of ghosts and hauntings are likely to have naturalistic explanations such as misidentification, [[hallucination]] or pranks and he was most interested in the 2% of the phenomena that he believed may be genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = No Common Task|last = Underwood|first = Peter|publisher = Harrap|year = 1983|isbn = 024553959X|location = London|page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwood was a long-standing member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gothicpress.freeserve.co.uk/Underwood.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019124215/http://www.gothicpress.freeserve.co.uk/Underwood.htm |archivedate=2006-10-19 |df= }} Underwood on the Gothic Press website&lt;/ref&gt; For some years Underwood was the Honorary Librarian of the [[Constitutional Club]] and the [[Savage Club]], where he was a former Member of the Qualifications Committee.  In 1976 a bust of Underwood was sculpted by Patricia Finch, winner of the Gold Medal for Sculpture in [[Venice]] (it currently resides with the Savage Club).

In 2018, a website was published dedicated to chronicling his life and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peterunderwood.org|title=The Life &amp; Work of the Renowned British Ghost-hunter|last=|first=|date=|website=www.peterunderwood.org|language=Default|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ghost Club Society==

Having been invited to join [[the Ghost Club]] by [[Harry Price]], Underwood was its President from 1960 to 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Borley Rectory Companion: The Complete Guide to the Most Haunted House in England|last=Adams|first=Paul|last2=Underwood|first2=Peter|last3=Brazil|first3=Eddie|date=2009-04-09|publisher=The History Press|year=|isbn=9780750950671|edition=1st|location=Stroud|pages=301|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Underwood formed the Ghost Club Society which was formed after his departure from the Ghost Club.&lt;ref name="book1"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Cheung  | first = Theresa  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Element Encyclopedia of the Psychic World  | publisher = Harper Element  | series =   | volume =   | edition =   | date = 2006  | location =   | pages = 244  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 978-0-00-721148-7  | mr =   | zbl =   | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership to the Ghost Club Society was by invitation only.

==Recognition==

In recognition of his more than seventy years of paranormal investigations - [[Jean Conan Doyle|Dame Jean Conan Doyle]] described him as 'The Sherlock Holmes of Psychical Research' &lt;ref name=sherlockpsychic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Michael|title=Haunted North Cornwall|date=2014|publisher=The History Press|isbn=0750954396|page=41}}; {{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Michael|title=Peter Underwood obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/17/peter-underwood|website=The Guardian|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; - Underwood accepted the invitation to be the Patron of The Ghost Research Foundation (founded in [[Oxford]] in 1992), which termed him the ''King of Ghost Hunters''. In 2000 Underwood was contacted by Clark R. Schmidt, Doctor of Esoteric Sciences from Celestial Visions School of Metaphysical Arts in Fort Lauderdale (founded in 1994) Florida, to become a lifelong member of the Universal Parapsychological and Metaphysical Association (founded in 1996) - which he accepted and shortly before his death he accepted an invitation to be the Patron of [[Paranormal Site Investigators]] (UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hidden-highgate.org/peter-underwood-r-p-1923-2014/|title=Peter Underwood R.I.P 1923 – 2014|publisher=hidden-highgate.org/|date=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarat Chandra Bose''' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: শরৎ চন্দ্র বসু; 6 September 1889 – 20 February 1950) was a barrister and [[Freedom fighters of India|Indian independence activist]].  He was the son of [[Janakinath Bose]] and elder brother of [[Subhas Chandra Bose]].

==Early life==
He was born to [[Janakinath Bose]] (father) and [[Prabhabati Bose (Dutt)|Prabhabati Devi]] in [[Howrah]] on 6 September 1889. [[Prabhabati Bose (Dutt)|Prabhabati Devi]] was part of the famous Dutt family of Hatkhola in north Kolkata. She gave birth to fourteen children, six daughters and eight sons, among whom were nationalist leader Sarat Chandra Bose, [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose]] and distinguished cardiologist [[Dr. Sunil Chandra Bose]].

Sarat Bose studied in [[Presidency College, Calcutta|Presidency College]], then affiliated with the [[University of Calcutta]], and then went to England in 1911 to become a barrister. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn. He began a successful legal practice upon his return to India, but later abandoned it to join the [[Indian independence movement]].&lt;ref&gt;.winentrance.com/general_knowledge/arat-chandra-bose.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
In 1936, Bose became the president of the Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee, and served as a member of the [[All India Congress Committee]] from 1936 to 1947. From 1946 to 1947, Bose would lead the Congress delegation to the [[Central Legislative Assembly]]. He strongly supported the formation of the [[Indian National Army]] by Subhas Bose, and actively participated in the [[Quit India movement]]. Following his brother's reported death in 1945, Bose would lead efforts to provide relief and aid to the families of INA soldiers through the [[INA Defence and Relief Committee]]. In 1946, he was appointed Member of the Interim Government for Works, Mines and Powers – the position of a minister in a national executive council led by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], and presided over by the Viceroy of India.

==Bengal partition and later life==
However, Bose resigned from the AICC in disagreement over the [[1946 Cabinet Mission to India|Cabinet Mission Plan]]'s call to partition [[Bengal]] between [[West Bengal|Hindu-majority]] and [[East Bengal|Muslim-majority]] regions. He attempt to construct a bid for a [[United Bengal|united but independent Bengal]] and [[North East India|North-East]] with [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]], the Bengali [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] leader. [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] (President of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] who would become Pakistan's founding father) supported it and so did [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. The [[Indian National Congress]] and the Hindu members of Indian Legislative Council from Bengal opposed it. (History of Bengal by R. C. Mazumder) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christophe Jaffrelot|title=A History of Pakistan and Its Origins|date=2004|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=9781843311492|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9sI_Y2CKAcC&amp;pg=PA42|ref=scb1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scb2&gt;{{cite web|title=Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy : His Life|url=http://thedailynewnation.com/news/34685/huseyn-shaheed-suhrawardy--his-life.html|website=thedailynewnation.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After India's independence, Bose would lead his brother's [[All India Forward Bloc|Forward Bloc]] and form the [[Socialist Republican Party (India)|Socialist Republican Party]], advocating a socialist system for Bengal and India. He died in 1950, in Calcutta.

On January 14, 2008, he stole a 1986 [[Acura]] car from a neighbor, driving it up to 90 miles per hour (145 km/h)— having learned the skill through video games— before crashing during a [[Car chase|police chase]].&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harden |first1=Blaine |title=A Runaway Situation in Seattle |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/18/AR2007011801681.html?noredirect=on |website=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=June 15, 2018 |date=January 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following morning, after being excused from [[Youth detention center|juvenile detention]], Booker traveled to [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]] on a [[bus]], without his mother's knowledge.&lt;ref name=seattletimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; He received a boarding pass from [[Southwest Airlines]] for a flight to [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]] via [[Phoenix, Arizona]], after lying that he was a 12-year-old with the last name "Williams" and that his mother was already in the boarding area.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Simon |first1=Dan |title=9-year-old runaway snuck on two flights |url=http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/anderson.cooper.360/blog/2007/01/9-year-old-runaway-snuck-on-two.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=June 15, 2018 |date=January 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pi&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mitchell |first1=Melanthia |title=9-year-old's cunning impresses many |url=https://www.postindependent.com/news/9-year-olds-cunning-impresses-many/ |website=Post Independent |accessdate=June 15, 2018 |date=January 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in San Antonio, he was stopped after attempting to board another flight to Dallas.&lt;ref name=pi/&gt; 

The incident gained the attention of [[Norm Dicks]], the local [[United States House of Representatives|U. S. Representative]], who said, "If a 9-year-old can exploit this (air travel) security system, we are going to have to look into the procedures."&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' labeled Booker possibly "the most persistent, most creative and most publicized 9-year-old runaway in the history of the [[Pacific Northwest]]," while ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine included him in an article about "5 Amazing Runaway Kid Stories" alongside [[Harry Houdini]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Alter |first1=Charlotte |title=5 Amazing Runaway Kid Stories |url=http://time.com/70245/5-amazing-stories-of-runaway-kids/ |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=June 15, 2018 |date=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booker was additionally featured on [[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]] and [[Inside Edition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exit133.com/articles/view/exclusive-transcript-from-dr-phil/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.drphil.com/slideshows/runaways-gone-wild-semaj/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16795703/ns/us_news-life/t/mothers-proud--year-old-runaway-son/&lt;/ref&gt;

Booker was later involved in another runaway attempt to Texas through the [[SeaTac/Airport station]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Boy-tries-to-hop-another-plane-1274613.php&lt;/ref&gt; Additional actions put him in juvenile detention and eventually led to him and his siblings being placed a foster home.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/11-year-old-who-once-hopped-plane-3-brothers-in-foster-care/&lt;/ref&gt; Booker later escaped from his foster home, eventually returning to his mother's home. In his middle school years, during which he lived in Texas and North Carolina, Booker began playing organized [[basketball]].

== Basketball career ==
=== High school ===
Throughout his high school tenure, he would go to four different campuses in Washington, at least one per each year of a regular high school tenure. In his sophomore season, he played for [[Lincoln High School (Tacoma, Washington)|Lincoln High School]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncsasports.org/mens-basketball-recruiting/washington/tacoma/lincoln-high-school-tacoma/semaj-booker&lt;/ref&gt; As a junior, he transferred to [[Curtis Senior High School]] in [[University Place, Washington]]. He also worked part-time as a referee at the time. He received a letter of interest from [[San Diego State University]] while at Curtis.&lt;ref&gt;https://lonzowire.usatoday.com/2018/04/10/this-jba-seattle-recruit-was-a-famous-runaway-stole-car-when-he-was-9/&lt;/ref&gt; Before his 18th birthday at the end of his junior year, he wast involved with a serious fight that led to his suspension from school, and he attended summer school at [[Oakland Alternative High School]] in Tacoma. In his senior year, Booker transferred to [[Clover Park High School]] in Lakewood, Washington. He gained interest from both [[Tacoma Community College]] and [[Evergreen State College]], but Booker veered away from those places, eventually stopping himself from going to classes at Clover Park altogether at one point. He projected to go to a preparatory school in Illinois to finish high school properly, but couldn't in part because of the birth of his son, Mathayus King Blue-Booker, on December 22, 2016, and partially because of an arrest he had in February 2017, which would lead to a court case on July that year; the case relating to his latest arrest is currently unresolved.

=== Professional ===
Before making the move to play professionally, Booker played in a recreational league.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/sports/nba/la-sp-lavar-ball-jba-hernandez-20180621-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; On April 7, 2018, Booker would be one of about 50 or 100 people to officially travel to [[Garfield High School (Washington)|Garfield High School]] to tryout for the [[Seattle Ballers]], one of eight teams created for the newly founded [[Junior Basketball Association]] (JBA).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.slamonline.com/uncategorized/jba-tryouts/&lt;/ref&gt; After the tryouts for Seattle concluded, Booker was named one of four players (at the time) to be confirmed for the newly formed team. He would make his professional debut for the JBA on June 23 against the [[Dallas Ballers]] at the [[Health and Physical Education Arena|H&amp;PE Arena]] in Houston, Texas. In that game, he recorded 12 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists, a steal, and a block as a starter in a blowout 121–103 win over the [[Dallas Ballers]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fibalivestats.com/u/JBA/885626/bs.html&lt;/ref&gt; In his next game a day later, he went on to become a bench player for Seattle in a 150–145 loss to the [[Los Angeles Ballers]], which featured premiere player [[LaMelo Ball]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fibalivestats.com/u/JBA/885629/bs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomas Blood.png|thumb|Thomas Blood]]

'''Colonel Thomas Blood''' (1618&amp;nbsp;– 24 August 1680) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] and self-styled [[colonel]] best known for his attempt to steal the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels of England]] from the [[Tower of London]] in 1671.  Described in an American source as a "noted bravo and desperado,"&lt;ref name=Ripley&gt;''The New American Cyclopaedia: A popular dictionary of general knowledge'', Volume 3, George Ripley, Charles A. Dana, 1859 (D Appleton &amp; Company) pages 372 to 373&lt;/ref&gt; he was known for his attempt to kidnap and, later, to kill, his enemy, the [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|Duke of Ormonde]]. He had switched allegiances from [[Cavalier|Royalist]] to [[Roundhead]] during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], and despite his subsequent notoriety received a [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|Royal free pardon]] and found favour at the court of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]].

==Early life==
Sources suggest that Blood was born in [[County Clare]], in the [[Kingdom of Ireland]],&lt;ref name=clare&gt;[http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/people/blood.htm Clare County Library: Colonel Thomas Blood]&lt;/ref&gt; the son of a successful land-owning [[blacksmith]] of English descent, and was partly raised at Sarney, near [[Dunboyne]], in [[County Meath]]. He was apparently a [[Presbyterian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/bq/04-1_027.pdf Colonel Thomas Blood, The Baptist Quarterly, W. T. Whiteley]&lt;/ref&gt; His family was respectable and prosperous (by the standards of the time); his father held lands in the Counties Clare, Meath and [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]]. His grandfather was a member of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]], and had lived at [[Kilnaboy|Kilnaboy Castle]] (also in County Clare).&lt;ref name=historic&gt;[http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/England-History/ColonelBlood.htm The Theft of the Crown Jewels], Historic-UK.com, E.P.C (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; He received his education in [[Lancashire]], England. At the age of 20, he married Maria Holcroft, the daughter of [[John Holcroft]], a gentleman from [[Golborne]], Lancashire, and returned to Ireland.&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;''London'' by Charles Knight, London 1851 (H.G. Bohn) pages 230–232&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of the [[First English Civil War]] in 1642, Blood returned to England and initially took up arms with the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] forces loyal to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. As the conflict progressed he switched sides and became a lieutenant in [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s [[Roundheads]].&lt;ref name=historic /&gt; In 1653 at the cessation of hostilities Cromwell awarded Blood [[land grants]] as payment for his service and appointed him a [[justice of the peace]]. Following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] to the Crowns of the Three Kingdoms in 1660, Blood fled with his family to Ireland.&lt;ref name=historic /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt; The confiscations and restitutions under the [[Act of Settlement 1662]] (which sought to cancel and annul some of the grants of land and real properties allocated as reward to new holders being Cromwellians under the [[Act of Settlement 1652]]) brought Blood to financial ruin, and in return Blood sought to unite his fellow Cromwellians in Ireland to cause insurrection.&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt;

==Irish discontent==
As part of the expression of discontent, Blood conspired to storm [[Dublin Castle]], usurp the government, and kidnap [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]] and [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], for ransom.  On the eve of the attempt, the plot was foiled. Blood managed to evade the authorities by hiding with his countrymen in the mountains, and ultimately managed to escape to the [[Dutch Republic|United Dutch Provinces in the Low Country]]. A few of Blood's collaborators were captured and executed. As a result, some historians speculated that Blood swore vengeance against Ormonde.&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt;

While in the Dutch Republic, Blood gained the favour of [[Michiel de Ruyter|Admiral de Ruyter]], an opponent of the English forces in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]], and was implicated in the Scottish [[Battle of Rullion Green|Pentland Rising]] of 1666 by the Scottish Presbyterian [[Covenanters]].&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt; At some point during this period, Blood became associated with the wealthy [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]], who 19th-century commentators believed used Blood as a means to punish his own political and social adversaries, since his own class ranking did not allow him to meet them "in the field".&lt;ref name=Ripley /&gt;

In 1670, despite his status as a wanted man, Blood returned to England and is believed to have taken the name Ayloffe and practised as a doctor or an [[apothecary]] in [[Romford Market]], east of London.&lt;ref name=historic /&gt; A second attempt, this time on the life of the Duke of Ormonde, followed.

Since Ormonde's return to England, he had taken up residence at [[Clarendon House]].&lt;ref name=Caulfield&gt;''Portraits Memoirs and Characters of Remarkable Persons from the reign of Edward III to the Revolution'', by [[James Caulfield]], Volume II, London, (1813) R.S Kirby pages 177–181&lt;/ref&gt; Blood had followed Ormonde's movements and noted that he frequently returned late in the evening accompanied by a small number of [[footmen]]. On the night of 6 December 1670, Blood and his accomplices attacked Ormonde while the latter travelled [[St James's Street]]. Ormonde was dragged from his coach, bound to one of Blood's henchmen, and taken on horseback along [[Piccadilly]] with the intention of hanging him at [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]]. The gang pinned a paper to Ormonde's chest spelling out their reasons for his capture and murder.&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt;&lt;ref name=Caulfield /&gt; With one of his servants who had given chase on horseback, Ormonde succeeded in freeing himself and escaped. The plot's secrecy meant that Blood was not suspected of the crime, despite a reward being offered for the capture of the attempted assassins. In the King's presence, James's son, [[Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory|Thomas Butler]], accused the Duke of Buckingham of being behind the crime. Thomas threatened to shoot Buckingham dead in revenge, if his father, James, was murdered.&lt;ref name=Ripley /&gt;

=== Theft of the Crown Jewels ===
Blood did not lie low for long, and within six months he made his notorious attempt to steal the Crown Jewels. In April or May 1671 he visited the [[Tower of London]] dressed as a [[parson]] and accompanied by a female companion pretending to be his wife. The Crown Jewels could be viewed by the payment of a fee to the custodian. While viewing the Crown Jewels, Blood's "wife" feigned a stomach complaint and begged the newly appointed Master of the Jewel House, 77-year-old Talbot Edwards, to fetch her some spirits.&lt;ref name=historic /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt;&lt;ref name=Caulfield /&gt; Given the proximity of the jewel keeper's domestic quarters to the site of the commotion, Edwards' wife invited them upstairs to their apartment to recover, after which Blood and his wife thanked the Edwardses and left.&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt;&lt;ref name=Caulfield /&gt;

Over the following days Blood returned to the Tower to visit the Edwardses and presented Mrs Edwards with four pairs of white gloves as a gesture of thanks. As Blood became ingratiated with the family, an offer was made for a fictitious nephew of Blood's to marry the Edwardses' daughter, who, Blood alleged, would be eligible, by virtue of the marriage, to an income of several hundred pounds.&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt;&lt;ref name=Caulfield /&gt;

On 9 May 1671, in furtherance of the deception, Blood convinced Edwards to show the jewels to him, his supposed nephew, and two of his friends while they waited for a dinner that Mrs Edwards was to put on for Blood and his companions. The jewel keeper's apartment was in Martin Tower above a basement where the jewels were kept behind a metal grille. Reports suggest that Blood's accomplices carried [[Walking stick|canes]] that concealed [[Rapier|rapier blades]], daggers, and pocket pistols. In entering the [[Jewel House]], one of the men made a pretence of standing watch outside while the others joined Edwards and Blood. The door was closed and a cloak thrown over Edwards, who was struck with a mallet, knocked to the floor, bound, gagged and stabbed to subdue him.&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt;&lt;ref name=Caulfield /&gt;

After removing the grille, Blood used the mallet to flatten [[St. Edward's Crown]] so that he could hide it beneath his clerical coat. Another conspirator, Blood's brother-in-law Hunt, filed the [[Sceptre with the Cross]] in two (as it did not fit in their bag), while the third man, Perrot, stuffed the [[Sovereign's Orb]] down his trousers. Meanwhile Edwards refused to stay subdued and fought against his bindings. Accounts vary as to whether Edwards' struggle caused sufficient disturbance to raise the alarm or whether the attempt was foiled in more fortuitous circumstances.&lt;ref name=Ripley /&gt;

Popular reports describe Edwards' son, Wythe, returning from military service in [[Flanders]], happening upon the attempted theft.&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt;&lt;ref name=Caulfield /&gt; At the door of the Jewel House, Wythe was met by the impromptu guard, who challenged him, before the young Edwards entered and went upstairs. The "guard" then alerted his fellow gang members.  At around the same time, the elder Edwards managed to free his gag, and raised the alarm shouting, "Treason! Murder! The crown is stolen!"

As Blood and his gang fled to their horses waiting at St Catherine's Gate, they dropped the sceptre and fired on the warders who attempted to stop them, wounding one.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KZQNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=blood+atttempt+to+steal+crown+jewels&amp;source=web&amp;ots=hNL27nhaOZ&amp;sig=ZccNxpa1EvxTmRi8ivyqWcM8LIM Old and New London: A Narrative of its History, its People and its Places] by Walter Thornbury and Edward Walford, Cassell &amp; Co. Limited (1881)&lt;/ref&gt; One [[drawbridge]] guard was struck with fear and failed to discharge his [[musket]]. As they ran along the Tower wharf it is said they joined the calls for alarm to confuse the guards until they were chased down by Captain Beckman, brother-in-law of the younger Edwards. Although Blood shot at him, he missed and was captured before reaching the Iron Gate. Having fallen from his cloak, the crown was found while Blood refused to give up, struggling with his captors and declaring, "It was a gallant attempt, however unsuccessful! It was for a crown!"&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt;&lt;ref name=Caulfield /&gt; The globe and orb were recovered although several stones were missing and others were loose. Hunt and Perrot were also taken, but not punished.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

===Aftermath===
Following his capture, Blood refused to answer to anyone but the King and was consequently taken to the palace in chains, where he was questioned by King Charles, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]], and others. King Charles asked Blood, "What if I should give you your life?", and Blood replied, "I would endeavour to deserve it, Sire!"&lt;ref name=historic/&gt;
To the disgust of Ormonde, Blood was not only pardoned but also given land in Ireland worth £500 a year. In contrast, Edwards' family was awarded less than £300 by the King, a sum which was never paid in full, and he returned to his duties at the Tower regaling visitors with his tales of the attempted theft. He died in 1674 and his tomb rests in the chapel of [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|St Peter's Ad Vincula]], at the Tower of London. 

The reasons for the King's pardon are unknown. Some historians have speculated that the King may have feared an uprising in revenge by followers of Blood, who were thought to have taken an oath to their leader.&lt;ref name=Caulfield /&gt; Others speculate that the King had a fondness for audacious scoundrels such as Blood, and that he was amused by the Irishman's claim that the jewels were worth only £6,000 as opposed to the £100,000 at which the Crown had valued them.&lt;ref name=historic /&gt;

There is also a suggestion that the King was flattered and amused by Blood's revelation that he had previously intended to kill him while he was bathing in the Thames but had been swayed otherwise, having found himself in "awe of majesty."&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt; It has also been suggested that his actions may have had the connivance of the king, because the King was very short of money at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston. ''My Early Life: A Roving Commission'', 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his pardon, Blood became a familiar figure around London and made frequent appearances at Court, where he was employed to advocate in the claims of suitors to the Crown. In [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]]'s ''History of Insipids'', he wrote of Blood:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Blood, that wears treason in his face,
Villain complete in parson's gown,
How much he is at court in grace
For stealing Ormond and the crown!
Since loyalty does no man good,
Let's steal the King, and outdo Blood!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In 1679 Blood fell into dispute with the Duke of Buckingham, his former patron, and Buckingham sued Blood for £10,000, for insulting remarks Blood had made about his character. In the proceedings that followed, Blood was convicted by the [[King's Bench]] in 1680 and granted bail, although he never paid the damages.&lt;ref name=historic /&gt;

==Death==
Blood was released from prison in July 1680 but had fallen into a coma by 22 August.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Alan|title=Intelligence and espionage in the reign of Charles II, 1660–1685|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-52127-0|pages=223|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RRp4FF0i1vkC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=%22Thomas+Blood%22+%2BAugust+%2B24#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Thomas%20Blood%22%20%2BAugust%20%2B24&amp;f=false|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 24 August at his home in Bowling Alley, [[Westminster]].  His body was buried in the churchyard of [[St Margaret's, Westminster|St Margaret's Church]] (now Christchurch Gardens) near [[St. James's Park]]. It is believed that his body was exhumed by the authorities for confirmation: such was his reputation for trickery, it was suspected he might have faked his death and funeral to avoid paying his debt to Buckingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Short biography of Thomas Blood at Christchurch Gardens|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&amp;GRid=6531625&amp;PIpi=267957|work=FindAGrave.com|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood's [[epitaph]] read:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Here lies the man who boldly hath run through
More villainies than England ever knew;
And ne'er to any friend he had was true.
Here let him then by all unpitied lie,
And let's rejoice his time was come to die.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===Legacy===
Blood's son [[Holcroft Blood]] became a distinguished military engineer rising to the rank of Brigadier-General; he commanded the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]]'s artillery at the [[Battle of Blenheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Major-General Whitworth |title=History of the Corps of Royal Engineers Vol II|year=1914 |publisher=The Institution of Royal Engineers |location=Chatham}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|381}} Descendants including General [[Sir Bindon Blood|Bindon Blood]], civil engineer [[William Bindon Blood]], [[Maurice Petherick]], and [[Brian Inglis]], had distinguished careers in British and Irish society.

[[File:Ranelagh.jpg|thumb|Viscount Ranelagh at the Volunteer gathering in Brighton, 1863, depicted in the [[Illustrated London News]]]] 
[[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] '''Thomas Heron Jones, 7th Viscount Ranelagh''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|KCB}} (9 January 1812 – 13 November 1885) was known for his involvement in the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|volunteer movement]] to recruit amateur soldiers for the defence of Britain, and for his links to glamorous women, notably the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] model [[Annie Miller]] and the actress [[Lillie Langtry]]. 

Heron Jones succeeded to the baronetcy becoming [[Viscount Ranelagh]] and Baron Jones of Navan in 1820 on the death of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Lodge, ''The genealogy of the existing British peerage: with brief sketches of the family histories of the nobility'', Saunders and Otley, 1832, p.301&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volunteer movement==
Ranelagh was an enthusiastic supporter of the movement to create a volunteer army, which had arisen from fears of a French invasion. He created and commanded the 2nd South Middlesex Rifle Volunteers in 1859, the nucleus of which was formed from members of the Ranelagh Yacht Club. Ranelagh became a ''de facto'' leader of the Volunteer movement and was introduced as such to the French emperor [[Napoleon III]]. In 1863 Ranelagh helped to organise a show of force in Brighton at which he gave a speech defending the movement from attempts by the government to take control of it. He insisted that an independent volunteer militia was both cheaper and more effective for the country than a centrally organised force. He asserted that the English character prefers independence and distrusts "organisation", claiming that "we trust to our own pluck, that indomitable pluck that all Englishmen possess".&lt;ref&gt;LORD RANELAGH WITH THE EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH, ''Otago Witness'', 7 Feb 1863.&lt;/ref&gt; At this period Ranelagh was calling for a volunteer "people's army", an aspiration supported by a section of the press at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Frederick William Beckett, ''The amateur military tradition, 1558–1945'', Manchester University Press ND, 1991, p.181-2.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to command the Volunteers until his death in 1885.

==Relationships==
[[File:Viscount Ranelagh Vanity Fair 25 June 1870.jpg|thumb|"He has succeeded in volunteering". Ranelagh depicted in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']].]]Ranelagh started a relationship with Annie Miller when her fiancé [[William Holman Hunt]] was away in the Middle East. He was described in the letters of Hunt and his friends as a "notorious rake" because of his womanising. When Hunt learned of the relationship he broke off the engagement, leading to a meeting between Annie and Ranelagh in which he suggested that she should sue Hunt for [[breach of promise]]. In the end, she married Ranelagh's cousin.&lt;ref name = "ann"&gt;Anne Clark Armor, ''William Holman Hunt'', Constable, p.178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranelagh was also responsible for introducing [[Lillie Langtry]] to London high society. According to Langtry herself "he completely changed the current of my life".&lt;ref&gt;Lillie Langtry, ''The Days I Knew'', p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; She became the centre of attention at a party to which he invited her, and was asked by both [[John Everett Millais]] and [[Frank Miles]] to sit for a portrait.  

With his partner, Ranelagh had two daughters, but no sons. The titles of Viscount Ranelagh and Baron Jones of Navan became extinct upon his death in 1885.

==See also==
Jones had two prominent relatives from his maternal grandmother:
* American Revolutionary War hero and former British Army officer Major General [[Richard Montgomery]]
* Colonel [[Alexander Montgomery (1720–1800)|Alexander Montgomery]], M.P. for County Donegal in 1768 and British Army officer

His sister Barbara married [[Count Johann Bernhard von Rechberg und Rothenlöwen|Count von Rechberg]] (1806-1899), Foreign Minister of Austria, 1859-1864.

'''John William (Willy) Kruyt''' (1877–1943) was a Dutch Protestant minister and [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]], later [[Communism|Communist]], politician.

==Background==
The son of a Dutch publisher and his Scottish wife, Kruyt studied [[theology]] at Utrecht and joined the [[League of Christian Socialists]] in 1910.

==Early political career==
In 1913, he was elected chairman of this party; in [[Dutch general election, 1918|1918]], he became its only member of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]]. In the same period, he worked as a [[Dutch Reformed Church|Reformed]] minister at [[Gennep]].{{r|blgnp}} When, in 1921, the League had disintegrated due to factional struggles between orthodox Protestants and [[Christian anarchism|anarchists]], Kruyt joined the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|Communist Party]].{{r|pp}} He stood as a Communist candidate for the [[Dutch general election, 1922|1922 elections]], but was not re-elected.

==Later career==
Following his wife's death, Kruyt emigrated to Berlin where he joined [[Workers International Relief]], then to Moscow in 1935 (presumably fleeing from the Nazis){{r|bwsa}} to work at the [[Russian State Library|Lenin State Library]]. Dissatisfied with [[Stalinism]], he trained as a [[espionage|spy]] in the hopes of getting back to the Netherlands this way. From England, he parachuted into Belgium in June 1942. He broke his leg and was arrested by the German occupiers who detained him at [[Fort Breendonk]].

==Death==
Kruyt was tortured and deported to the [[Moabit]] prison in Berlin where he is thought to have been [[Execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] in 1943.{{r|bwsa}}

'''Émile Nelligan''' (December 24, 1879 &amp;ndash; November 18, 1941) was a [[francophone]] [[poetry|poet]] from [[Quebec]], Canada.

==Biography==
Nelligan was born in [[Montreal]] on December 24, 1879 at 602, rue de La Gauchetière (Annuaire Lovell's de 1879). He was the first son of David Nelligan, who arrived in Quebec from [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] at the age of 12. His mother was Émilie Amanda Hudon, from [[Rimouski]], Quebec. He had two sisters, Béatrice and Gertrude.

A follower of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], he produced poetry profoundly influenced by [[Octave Crémazie]], [[Louis Fréchette]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Georges Rodenbach]], [[Maurice Rollinat]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. A precocious talent like [[Arthur Rimbaud]], he published his first poems in Montreal at the age of 16.

In 1899, Nelligan began to exhibit odd behavior. He was said to have loudly recited poetry to passing strangers and slept in chapels. He was also experiencing hallucinations and he attempted [[suicide]]. He was committed to a mental hospital at the request of his parents. There he was diagnosed with [[dementia praecox]] (now more commonly referred to as schizophrenia). He did not write any poetry after being hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poets/nelligan-emile|title=Nelligan, Emile {{!}} Representative Poetry Online|website=rpo.library.utoronto.ca|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, rumor and speculation suggested that he went insane because of the vast cultural and language differences between his mother and father. In recent years, however, a number of literary critics have postulated that Nelligan was [[gay]].&lt;ref&gt;"Émile Nelligan, interné parce que gai?" ''[[Michel Désautels|Désautels]]'', January 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these sources suggest that he became mentally ill due to inner conflict between his sexuality and his religious upbringing, while others suggest that he never went insane at all, but was involuntarily committed to the asylum by his family for [[homophobia|homophobic]] reasons.&lt;ref name=dostie&gt;Gaëtan Dostie, [http://ssjb.com/nelligan-et-de-bussieres-crees-par-dantin/ "Nelligan et de Bussières créés par Dantin ?"]. ''Le Patriote''. Republished by the [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society]] of Montreal, July 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; No biographical sources published during Nelligan's lifetime contain any confirmed record of Nelligan having had any sexual or romantic relationships with either men or women,&lt;ref&gt;Émile J. Talbot, ''Reading Nelligan''. [[McGill-Queen's University Press]], 2002. {{ISBN|0773523189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although some posthumous sources have suggested that he may have been the lover of poet [[Arthur de Bussières]].&lt;ref name=dostie/&gt; Within the ''École littéraire de Montréal'' circle with which both Nelligan and Bussières were associated, it was widely believed that Nelligan was confined to the asylum because his mother discovered him and Bussières in bed together,&lt;ref name=dostie/&gt; although this claim was not widely publicized until the late 20th century and remains unconfirmed. Conversely, the 1991 biographical film ''[[Nelligan (film)|Nelligan]]'' depicts Nelligan as nearly [[asexuality|asexual]], portraying him as sexually ambivalent in the face of romantic attractions to both Bussières and feminist activist [[Idola Saint-Jean]], and implying that his mother attempted to commit [[incest]] with him.&lt;ref&gt;"A revisionist adjusts the halo: Emile Nelligan; Rather than placing Quebec's beloved tragic poet on a pedestal, director Robert Favreau portrays his subject as a rather gloomy adolescent". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', October 26, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, his collected poems were published to great acclaim in Canada. He may not have been aware that he was counted among French Canada's greatest poets.

On his death in 1941, Nelligan was interred in the [[Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges]] in Montreal, Quebec. Following his death, the public became increasingly interested in Nelligan. His incomplete work spawned a kind of romantic legend. He was first translated into English in 1960 by P.F. Widdows. In 1983, [[Fred Cogswell]] translated all his poems in ''The Complete Poems of Émile Nelligan''. In the fall of 2017, Montreal's Vehicle Press will be releasing Marc di Saverio's English translations of Nelligan, Ship of Gold: The Essential Poems of Emile Nelligan.

Nelligan is considered one of the greatest poets of French Canada. Several schools and libraries in Quebec are named after him, and [[Hotel Nelligan]] is a four-star hotel in [[Old Montreal]] at the corner of Rue St. Paul and Rue St. Sulpice.

In her 2013 book ''Le Naufragé du Vaisseau d'or'', Yvette Francoli claimed that [[Louis Dantin]], the publisher of Nelligan's poems, was in fact their real author.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lactualite.com/culture/limposture-nelligan/ "L’imposture Nelligan"]. ''[[L'actualité]]'', November 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was also previously advanced by [[Claude-Henri Grignon]] in his 1936 essay ''Les Pamphlets de Valdombre'',&lt;ref name=dostie/&gt; although Dantin himself denied having had anything more than an [[editor|editing]] role in the poems' creation. In 2016, the [[University of Ottawa]]'s literary journal ''@nalyses'' published an article by Annette Hayward and Christian Vandendorpe which rejected the claim, based on textual comparisons of the poetry credited to Nelligan with the writings of Dantin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Annette Hayward|author2=Christian Vandendorpe|title=Dantin et Nelligan au piège de la fiction: ''Le naufragé du Vaisseau d'or'' d'Yvette Francoli|journal= @nalyses|pages=232–327|date=2016|ISSN=1715-9261 |URL=https://uottawa.scholarsportal.info/ojs/index.php/revue-analyses/article/view/1587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Le Vaisseau d'Or ''==
[[Image:Émile Nelligan (bust), parc Square Saint-Louis, Montréal 2005-10-21.jpg|thumb|Émile Nelligan bust, Saint-Louis Square, Montreal]]
''{{lang|fr|Ce fut un grand Vaisseau taillé dans l'or massif:&lt;br/&gt;Ses mâts touchaient l'azur, sur des mers inconnues;&lt;br/&gt;La Cyprine d'amour, cheveux épars, chairs nues,&lt;br/&gt;S'étalait à sa proue, au soleil excessif.}}''

''{{lang|fr|Mais il vint une nuit frapper le grand écueil&lt;br/&gt;Dans l'Océan trompeur où chantait la Sirène,&lt;br/&gt;Et le naufrage horrible inclina sa carène&lt;br/&gt;Aux profondeurs du Gouffre, immuable cercueil.}}''

''{{lang|fr|Ce fut un Vaisseau d'Or, dont les flancs diaphanes&lt;br/&gt;Révélaient des trésors que les marins profanes,&lt;br/&gt;Dégoût, Haine et Névrose, entre eux ont disputés.}}''

''{{lang|fr|Que reste-t-il de lui dans sa tempête brève?&lt;br/&gt;Qu'est devenu mon coeur, navire déserté?&lt;br/&gt;Hélas! Il a sombré dans l'abîme du Rêve!}}''

==''Christ en Croix''==

Je remarquais toujours ce grand Jésus de plâtre&lt;br/&gt;
Dressé comme un pardon au seuil du vieux couvent,&lt;br/&gt;
Échafaud solennel à geste noir, devant&lt;br/&gt;
Lequel je me courbais, saintement idolâtre.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Or, l'autre soir, à l'heure où le cri-cri folâtre,&lt;br/&gt;
Par les prés assombris, le regard bleu rêvant,&lt;br/&gt;
Récitant Eloa, les cheveux dans le vent,&lt;br/&gt;
Comme il sied à l'Éphèbe esthétique et bellâtre,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
J'aperçus, adjoignant des débris de parois,&lt;br/&gt;
Un gigantesque amas de lourde vieille croix&lt;br/&gt;
Et de plâtre écroulé parmi les primevères;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Et je restai là, morne, avec les yeux pensifs,&lt;br/&gt;
Et j'entendais en moi des marteaux convulsifs&lt;br/&gt;
Renfoncer les clous noirs des intimes Calvaires!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Translation by Konrad Bongard

''The gypsum Jesus always stalled me in my steps&lt;br/&gt;Like a curse at the old convent door;&lt;br/&gt;Crouching meekly, I bend to exalt an idol&lt;br/&gt;Whose forgiveness I do not implore.''

''Not long ago, at the crickets' hour, I roamed dim&lt;br/&gt;Meadows in a restful reverie&lt;br/&gt;Reciting 'Eloa', with my hair worn by the wind&lt;br/&gt;And no audience save for the trees.''

''But now, as I lie with knees bent beneath Christ's scaffold,&lt;br/&gt;I see his crumbling mortar cross&lt;br/&gt;With its plaster buried in the roses, and am saddened -''

''For if I listen close enough, I can almost hear&lt;br/&gt;The sound of coal-black nails being wrung in&lt;br/&gt;To his wrists, the savage piercing of Longinus' spear.''

== Tribute ==
