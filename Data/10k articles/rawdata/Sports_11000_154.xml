The '''[[1975–76 NHL season|1975–76]] [[California Golden Seals]] season''' would be the Seals' ninth and final [[season (sports)|season]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] of California. The Seals were led by rookie [[Dennis Maruk]].

Maruk centered the 3M line with [[Bob Murdoch (ice hockey, born 1954)|Bob Murdoch]] and [[Al MacAdam]]. Both Maruk and MacAdam scored over 30 goals while Murdoch led the team in power play goals. Although they recorded a solid improvement over the previous season, the Seals fell 7 points shy of a playoff spot.

Owner Mel Swig was counting on the construction of a new arena in San Francisco, but after the proposal was defeated, he was convinced by minority owner [[George Gund III]] to relocate the franchise to Cleveland, where it was renamed [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Cleveland Barons]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/caloak/seals&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[1984–85 NHL season|1984–85]] [[Calgary Flames]] season''' was the [[Calgary Flames seasons|fifth]] [[Season (sports)|season]] in [[Calgary]] and 13th for the Flames franchise in the [[National Hockey League]].  It was a breakout season for the Flames, as they tied a franchise record for wins with 41, and set new team marks for points, 95, and goals for, 363.  Despite the improvement, the Flames managed only a third-place finish in the [[Smythe Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Year-by-year results, ''2007–08 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the playoffs, the Flames met the second place [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg Jets]], where they fell three games to one.

Following the playoff disappointment, General Manager [[Cliff Fletcher]] began a series of moves to remake the team that included shipping out top scorer [[Kent Nilsson]] in a deal for a pair of second round draft picks that would eventually become [[Joe Nieuwendyk]] and [[Stéphane Matteau|Stephane Matteau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=13853 Kent Nilsson profile] @ ''legendsofhockey.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Calgary hosted the [[37th National Hockey League All-Star Game|1985 All-Star Game]] at the [[Pengrowth Saddledome|Olympic Saddledome]], a 6–4 victory by the [[Wales Conference]] over the [[Campbell Conference]].  The Flames were represented at the game by [[Al MacInnis]] and [[Paul Reinhart]].&lt;ref&gt;All-Star selections, ''2007–08 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comma 6 to 7 (Lodo Petrucci)==
Lodo Petrucci was a ruling name after [[Gianni Petrucci]]. Ratified in 2004, instead of acquiring the sports title by clearing the debt, FIGC could awarded the title to a new company based on sports merit of the old club. However, the club automatically relegated one level below the original club. In 2008 the rule had changed to two levels below the original club, and limited to Serie A and B clubs only. The ruling was abolished in 2015.

The '''Brazilian Rugby Confederation''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Confederação Brasileira de Rugby'', '''CBRu''') is the governing body for [[rugby union]] in [[Brazil]]. It was founded in 1972 and became affiliated to the [[International Rugby Board]] in 1995.

The confederation has six affiliate state federations: Gaúcha (Rio Grande do Sul), Catarinense (Santa Catarina), Paranaense (Paraná), Paulista (São Paulo), Mineira (Minas Gerais), and Fluminense (Rio de Janeiro). Other state federations are unaffiliated with the CBRu.

It organizes the [[Campeonato Brasileiro de Rugby]] (Série A / Super 8), Taça Tupi (Série B) and Campeonato Brasileiro de Rugby Sevens.

From 2010 onwards, the Brazilian Rugby Union has been sponsored by [[Topper (sports)|Topper]] and [[Bradesco]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32979">The '''Chess World Cup 2005''' served as a qualification tournament for the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2007]]. It was held as a 128-player tournament, between 27 November and 17 December 2005, in [[Khanty-Mansiysk]], Russia.

Top ten players qualified for the candidates matches of the World Chess Championship 2007. One of them ([[Étienne Bacrot]]) has qualified for the candidates matches via rating, freeing the place for the eleventh player at the World Cup ([[Vladimir Malakhov (chess player)|Vladimir Malakhov]]).

The World Cup was won by [[Levon Aronian]].

==Background==
The 2005 World Cup was part of the cycle for the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2007]]. Three of the players at the World Cup, [[Levon Aronian]], [[Alexander Grischuk]] and [[Boris Gelfand]], went on to qualify for the World Championship, which was held as an eight-player double round-robin event, with Gelfand finishing third.

Four top finishers of the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2005]] ([[Veselin Topalov]], [[Viswanathan Anand]], [[Peter Svidler]] and [[Alexander Morozevich]]) were already invited to the World Championship 2007 and thus exempt from the World Cup.

==Playing conditions==
The tournament was in the style of the FIDE World Chess Championships between 1998 and 2004: each round consisted of a two-game match, followed by tie breaks at faster time controls if required. In rounds 1–3 losing players were eliminated. However, in rounds 4–6 defeated players progressed to the next round, to determine standings of the 16 best players.

The time control for regular games was 90 minutes for the first 40 moves and 15 minutes for the rest of the game, with 30 seconds added after each move. Tie breaks consisted of two rapid chess games (25 minutes each + 10 seconds per move); followed by two blitz games if required (5 minutes + 10 seconds per move); followed by a single [[Armageddon chess]] game if required (white has 6 minutes and must win, black has 5 minutes and only needs to draw).

==Qualification==
The following players qualified for the World Cup:
*Three of the four semi-finalists of the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2004]] ([[Rustam Kasimdzhanov]], [[Michael Adams (chess player)|Michael Adams]] and [[Teimour Radjabov]]); the fourth semi-finalist, [[Veselin Topalov]], was the reigning FIDE World Champion and already had a berth in the next championship.
*[[Women's World Chess Championship|Women's World Champion]] 2004 ([[Antoaneta Stefanova]]).
*[[World Junior Chess Championship|Junior World Champion]] 2004 ([[Pendyala Harikrishna]]).
*22 players with the highest [[Elo rating]]. The average ratings from July 2004 and January 2005 were used.
*90 players qualified from the continental and zonal championships:
**46 players from Europe,
**19 players from the Americas,
**19 players from Asia and Oceania,
**6 players from Africa.
*8 nominees of the FIDE President.
*3 nominees of the local Organising Committee.

==Participants==
All players are [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmasters]] unless indicated otherwise.

'''Colonials Arena''' (formerly '''The RMU Island Sports Center Ice Arena''' and later the '''84 Lumber Arena''') is a 1,200-seat [[ice hockey]] rink located at the '''RMU Island Sports Center''', accessible via exit 65 of [[Interstate 79]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kitsko|first=Jeffrey|title=Pennsylvania Highways: Interstate 79 Exit Guide|url=http://www.pahighways.com/exits/I79exits.html|work=Pennsylvania Highways|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the [[Pittsburgh]] suburb of [[Neville Island, Pennsylvania|Neville Island]] in [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. The RMU Island Sports Center was built in 1998, and houses several ice and inline skating rinks, a golf range, a miniature golf course, athletic fields, a strength and fitness center, and a pro shop.  Robert Morris University and 84 Lumber reached a deal by which 84 Lumber would receive naming rights as of March 21, 2012. The arena later dropped the 84 Lumber name before the 2017-18 season and reverted to being known as the Colonials Arena at the RMU Island Sports Center.

It is home to the [[Robert Morris Colonials]] men's and women's [[NCAA Division I]] [[College ice hockey|ice hockey]] teams competing in [[Atlantic Hockey]] and [[College Hockey America]] respectively, as well as RMU's club hockey team competing at the [[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA Division I]] level in the [[College Hockey Mid-America]] conference (CHMA) and various local youth hockey programs. In addition, it is home to the [[Pittsburgh Curling Club]].

The arena served as the former home of the [[Pittsburgh Forge]] Junior-A [[NAHL]] team, which moved to [[Toledo, Ohio]] in 2003.

'''Deir ez-Zor Municipal Stadium''' ({{lang-ar|ملعب دير الزور البلدي}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Deir ez-Zor]], [[Syria]]. It is currently used mostly for [[association football|football]] matches. The stadium has a capacity of 13,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alwehda.gov.sy/index.php/%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%B1/2062-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%A2%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B8%D8%A9-%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%B1 Sports facilities in Deir ez-Zor]&lt;/ref&gt;

An artificial training field was opened near the stadium in 2007.

However, the stadium was heavily damaged between 2015 and 2017, while being occupied by the militants of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].

The '''Dnipro-Arena''' ({{lang-uk|Дніпро-Арена}}) is a football [[stadium]] in [[Dnipro]], [[Ukraine]].  It is mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and hosts the homes matches of [[FC Dnipro]].  The stadium has a capacity of 31,003 people. It replaced Dnipro's old Soviet Metalurh Stadium.

==History==
[[File:Dnipro Arena-View from Kucherevsky boulevard (North Enter).jpg|thumb|left|North entrance of the stadium]]
The Dnipro-Arena staged the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 6|2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying]] match between [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[England national football team|England]] as the [[Olimpiysky National Sports Complex]] in [[Kiev]] was being rebuilt ready for [[UEFA Euro 2012]].

The Dnipro-Arena was chosen as a possible venue for [[UEFA Euro 2012]], but was dropped from the list in May 2009. The capacity fell short of the minimum 33,000 seats required by [[UEFA]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/feedarticle/8499613 Kiev and Donetsk likely for Euro 2012, others uncertain]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5it8f_MOzCKu2hxVHUUXwOvzetMIw UEFA names four Polish Euro 2012 host cities, one in Ukraine]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dnipro-Arena hosted the 2009 [[Ukrainian Cup]] final, in which [[Vorskla Poltava]] beat [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] 1–0.

Since the beginning of [[armed conflict|conflict]] in [[Eastern Ukraine]], Dnipro have played their European matches at the [[Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Kiev]] at the behest of [[UEFA]], although there has been comparatively less conflict in Dnipro than other areas.

'''Empire Field''' was a temporary [[Canadian football]] and [[soccer]] [[stadium]] built at [[Hastings Park]] in the Canadian city of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. Located on the site of the former [[Empire Stadium (Vancouver)|Empire Stadium]], the 27,528 spectator venue was constructed to allow a new [[retractable roof]] to be installed at [[BC Place]] in 2010 and 2011. Empire Field was home to the [[Canadian Football League]]'s (CFL) [[BC Lions]] for the [[2010 BC Lions season|2010]] and part of the [[2011 BC Lions season|2011]] seasons, and for [[Major League Soccer]]'s (MLS) [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]] for part of their debut [[2011 Vancouver Whitecaps FC season|2011 season]].

The venue was constructed by [[Nussli Group]] in three months, cost $14.4 million and opened on June 15, 2010. The venue featured 20,500 roofed bucket seats—with the remaining 7,000 being benches—12 [[luxury suite]]s, a press room, [[floodlights (sport)|flood lighting]] and a [[FieldTurf]] [[artificial turf]]. The venue's record attendance are two sell-out matches: for the Lions it occurred in inaugural 2010 regular-season match against the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]]; for the Whitecaps, it was a regular-season match against the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]]. Dismantling took place in November and December 2011 and the site is now used as a community playing field.

==History==
Empire Field was built on the same lot as Empire Stadium, which was originally built for the [[1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]]. The 32,375-spectator stadium was used by the Lions from [[1954 BC Lions season|1954]] until [[1982 BC Lions season|1982]]. For soccer, the venue was used by [[North American Soccer League]]'s [[Vancouver Royals]] from 1967 to 1968 and subsequently by the [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1974–84)|Vancouver Whitecaps]] from [[1974 Vancouver Whitecaps season|1974]] to [[1982 Vancouver Whitecaps season|1982]]. Both the Lions and Whitecaps moved to the newly constructed, then 60,000 seat BC Place for the 1983 season.&lt;ref name=macmahon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/09/22/vancouver-will-remember-empire-field-fondly-finale-nears |title=Vancouver will remember Empire Field fondly as finale nears |last=MacMahon |first=Martin |date=September 22, 2011 |publisher=[[Major League Soccer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empire Stadium was demolished in 1993,&lt;ref name=writes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/321002-empire-stadium-reborn-why-the-cfl-bog-will-insist-it-sucks |title=Empire Stadium Reborn: Why The CFL BOG Will Insist It Sucks |last=Writes |first=Tobi |date=January 6, 2010 |work=[[Bleacher Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the location converted to a community sports park.&lt;ref name=little&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/sports/golf/With+temporary+stadium+Lions+Whitecaps+bank+nostalgia/2372224/story.html |title=With temporary stadium, Lions, Whitecaps bank on nostalgia |last=Little |first=Lyndon |date=December 22, 2009 |publisher=[[Canwest]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626080606/http://www.canada.com/sports/golf/With+temporary+stadium+Lions+Whitecaps+bank+nostalgia/2372224/story.html |archivedate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation opened Empire Bowl on the site on 2003, which consisted of a {{convert|5.5|ha}} lot, costing $2.9 million.

[[File:Empire Field near empty.jpg|thumb|left|The field in soccer configuration on April 2, 2011]]
Following a 2007 roof deflation at BC Place, Premier [[Gordon Campbell]] announced on the plans to build a retractable roof on the stadium.&lt;ref name=get&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=237961 |title=B.C. Place stadium to get retractable roof |work=[[The Sports Network]] |date=May 16, 2008 | accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stadium owner and operator [[BC Pavilion Corporation]] (PavCo) announced on October 23, 2009 that they had signed a fix-cost agreement with PCL Constructors Canada to build a new roof, including the cost of a temporary stadium. The construction was financed through a loan from the provincial government to PavCo.&lt;ref name=upgrade&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.vancouversun.com/sports/Place+million+upgrade/2137532/story.html |title=BC Place to get $458 million upgrade|work=[[Vancouver Sun]] |date=May 16, 2008 | accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to build the roof was, according to Whitecaps president [[Bob Lenarduzzi]], "key" to bringing a MLS franchise to Vancouver.&lt;ref name=upgrade /&gt; In 2009, the Whitecaps signed a five-year agreement to play their home matches at BC Place, starting in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2009/08/25/bc-stadium-roof-delayed.html |title=BC Place retractable-roof project delayed |work=[[CBC News]] |date=August 25, 2009 | accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To allow the Lions to continue playing as normal and support the new Whitecaps franchise, PavCo decided to build the temporary venue at the [[Pacific National Exhibition]] (PNE) in [[Hastings Park]] in eastern Vancouver.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/football/bc-place-to-be-gussied-up-in-time-for-2011-grey-cup/article1781720/ |title=B.C.

The details for the stadium were launched av PNE and PavCo on December 22, 2009. The venue cost $14.4 million in a fixed-price contract, and was included in the $458 million set aside to renovate BC Place. Representatives from both teams stated that they hoped to play on the nostalgia factor for the affected seasons.&lt;ref name=little /&gt; The Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation stated immediately after the press release that they had not been consulted or informed about the decision to build a professional sports venue on their grounds. Although the board was responsible for operating the facilities, the land was owned by PNE, which is again owned by the city. There were no public hearings or a city council vote to decide on the issue.&lt;ref name=mackin /&gt;

[[File:Empire under the moon.jpg|thumb|Whitecaps vs. [[Columbus Crew]] on July 6, 2011]]
The contract to build the stadium was issued the Nussli Group of Switzerland, which specializes in the construction of temporary stadiums.&lt;ref name=gilbert&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalofcommerce.com/article/id39401 |title=Overlay work wraps up Empire Field construction in Vancouver |last=Gilbert |first=Richard |date=June 23, 2010 |work=[[Journal of Commerce]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used their NT grandstand system, which allowed for modular construction of stands. Construction implemented 2,500 tonnes of material.&lt;ref name=nussli /&gt; Nussli's senior project manager, Florian Weber, stated that the most difficult part of the construction was the occupancy permit, caused by the short construction schedule.&lt;ref name=gilbert /&gt; Construction took 111 days,&lt;ref name=savino&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1110/major-league-soccer/2011/03/28/2414565/business-off-the-pitch-temporary-stadiums-a-permanent |title=Is there a lower cost option for MLS clubs? |last=Savino |first=Christopher |date=May 28, 2011 |publisher=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was completed in late June 2010.&lt;ref name=nussli /&gt; Several commentators stated that use of temporary stadiums on a permanent basis could be used for other MLS and CFL stadia. For instance, the price of building an 18,500 seat permanent [[soccer-specific stadium]] was averaging $200 million.&lt;ref name=savino /&gt;

After the reopening of BC Place, the stands at Empire Field were disassembled in November and December 2011, with the turf, locker rooms and lighting masts being left behind.&lt;ref name=mackin /&gt; Equipment and components leased from Nussli were returned.&lt;ref name=update&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nussli.com/fileadmin/content/ueber_nussli/Downloads/Kundenmagazin/English/20101118_up__date_2010_en_low.pdf |title=A Real Novelty in North America |last=Kuhland |first=Karin |date=November 2010 |work=Update |publisher=[[Nussli Group]] |pages=3–4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714215409/http://www.nussli.com/fileadmin/content/ueber_nussli/Downloads/Kundenmagazin/English/20101118_up__date_2010_en_low.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public consultations regarding use of the lot were conducted until June 2012, after which it was decided to create a community sports park. It features a mountain bike park to the north, a {{convert|3.9|m|sp=us|adj=on}} wide [[running track]] around the field and a [[skateboarding]] and graffiti tunnel. The area around the turf was expanded, allowing for two east–west fields, rather than one north–south.&lt;ref name=mackin /&gt; The legacy items were valued at $2.8 million in 2010.&lt;ref name=gilbert /&gt;

==Specifications==
Empire Field was located in Hastings Park, in the Vancouver neighborhood of [[Hastings-Sunrise]], next to [[Playland (Vancouver)|Playland]], an [[amusement park]]. Other sports facilities at Hastings Park include [[Pacific Coliseum]] and [[PNE Agrodome|Agrodome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pne.ca/aboutus/hastings-park-pne-master-plan.html |title=Hastings Park / PNE Master Plan |publisher=[[Pacific National Exhibition]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The venue was owned by the BC Pavilion Corporation, which in turn is owned by the provincial [[Government of British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=nussli&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nussli.us/projects/project-details/news/temporary-stadium-empire-field-vancouver-1160/402.html |title=Temporary Stadium, Empire Field Vancouver |publisher=[[Nussli Group]] |date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies on the grounds of and will be operated by the Pacific National Exhibition,&lt;ref name=gilbert /&gt; which is owned by the [[Vancouver City Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pne.ca/aboutus/governance.html |title=Governance |publisher=[[Pacific National Exhibition]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lions Opener.jpg|thumb|left|The Lions playing the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] in the field's first regular season game, on July 10, 2010]]
The stadium featured a seating capacity of 27,528,&lt;ref name=sekeres&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/football/bc-lions-say-good-riddance-to-empire-field/article627204/ |title=B.C. Lions say good riddance to Empire Field |last=Sekeres |first=Matthew |date=September 11, 2011 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which ca. 20,500 were bucket seats and ca. 7,000 were benches.&lt;ref name=nussli /&gt; The bucket seats were located under a roof, while there was no roof on the bench ends.&lt;ref name=little /&gt; In addition there are twelve [[executive boxes]], a VIP zone, [[floodlights (sport)|flood lighting]] and media facilities.&lt;ref name=nussli /&gt; Empire Field uses the FieldTurf artificial turf which was used at BC Place prior to the renovations.&lt;ref name=little /&gt; The venue was built so that it would not receive additional seating during playoffs.&lt;ref name=writes /&gt; Lockers were located in construction trailers, with players having to pass through pedestrian traffic in the concourse to reach the lockers.&lt;ref name=sekeres /&gt;

Compared to BC Place, Empire Field's seats were located closer to the field, giving a more intimate fan experience. The use of Empire Field deteriorated the Lions' strong [[home advantage]]. As BC Place was the only domed stadium in the CFL, its pressurized air made breathing more difficult, it had high summer night temperatures and a slight air flow which put off opposing [[kicker (football)|kickers]]. The dome amplified the crowd, making team communication difficult.&lt;ref name=sekeres /&gt; John Knox, president of the [[Vancouver Southsiders]], described Empire as their ancestral home and that "it gave us a taste of the experience our parents and their parents had when going to matches in Vancouver."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metronews.ca/sports/27718/a-fond-farewell-to-empire-field/ |title=A fond farewell to Empire Field |last=Kieltyka |first=Matt |work=[[Metro International|Metro Vancouver]] |date=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] served the stadium with the [[135 Express]] and Line 28. On game days, the transit operator set up special buses which connected with the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] at [[Renfrew Station]] and [[29th Avenue Station]]. Hastings Park is located on the [[Trans-Canada Highway]]. There are 1,300 parking spaces within a ten-minute walk from the stadium site. Several of these lots are offered with season parking tickets, which for 2010 cost $300. The stadium provided a free bicycle valet service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bclions.com/page/parking-and-transportation |title=Transit and parking information |publisher=[[BC Lions]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815121355/http://bclions.com/page/parking-and-transportation |archivedate=August 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to BC Place, which is located [[Downtown Vancouver|Downtown]], Empire Field offered poor public transport service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/football/cfl/bc-place-facelift/ |title=BC Place turns into state-of-the-art facility |date=September 29, 2011 |publisher=[[Sportsnet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Caps' first game was a 4–2 victory over [[Toronto FC]] on March 19, in front of 22,592 spectators.&lt;ref name=macmahon /&gt; The team played 13 of 17 MLS home games at Empire Field, in addition to both home games in the [[2011 Canadian Championship]] and a friendly against [[Manchester City]] as part of the [[2011 World Football Challenge]]. The Whitecaps' last game at Empire Field, a 3–1 loss to [[Seattle Sounders FC]], took place on September 24. The first match at BC Place was played on October 2. The Caps had an average attendance of 20,577 for their 13 MLS games, with the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] drawing a record high crowd of 27,500 and the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] drawing a record low crowd of 15,608. In comparison, the team's four games at BC Place drew an average 19,850 spectators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2035">'''Hutsell-Rosen Track''' (originally named William Hutsell Track) is an outdoor track and field facility located in [[Auburn, Alabama]] on the campus of [[Auburn University]]. It is the official outdoor track and field facility for the [[Auburn_Tigers#Track_and_field|Auburn Tigers track and field teams]].  Along with [[John McDonnell Field]] in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]], [[Hayward Field]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]], [[Icahn Stadium]] in New York City and Rock Chalk Park in [[Lawrence, Kansas]], Hutsell-Rosen is one of only five [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] Class 1-certified track and field complexes in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Certified Athletics Facilities |url=http://www.iaaf.org/mm/Document/06/02/67/60267_PDF_English.pdf |date=July 1, 2012 |work=International Association of Athletics Federations |accessdate=2012-07-01 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026023747/http://iaaf.org/mm/Document/06/02/67/60267_PDF_English.pdf |archivedate=October 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After being constructed in 1970, the facility was originally named Wilbur Hutsell Track, in honor of [[William Hutsell]], the first track coach at Auburn. After major renovations in 2006, the facility was officially renamed on April 22, 2008 to honor both Hutsell and [[Mel Rosen]], Auburn's second track and field coach, who coached the team for 28 years.  Hutsell-Rosen has hosted the [[Southeastern Conference]] Track and Field Championships five times since its construction, in 1973, 1980, 1988, 1997, and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auburntigers.cstv.com/facilities/aub-10-track.html Hutsell Rosen Track]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Bowra''' (baptised 3 June 1716 at [[Sevenoaks]], [[Kent]]; buried 22 December 1785 at Sevenoaks) was an English [[professionalism|professional]] [[cricket]]er of the mid-Georgian period who made 5 known appearances in [[first-class cricket]].

==Career==
John Bowra (pronounced ''Borra'') has been identified as "Mr. Boarer", one of "three very good gamesters", who assisted [[London Cricket Club|London]] in a match on [[Kennington Common]] in 1739.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in the 1740s, he appeared in several great matches on the [[Artillery Ground]] as "John Borah" and represented [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]].  He played for [[Robert Colchin]]'s XI, largely a Kent team, against [[Richard Newland (cricketer)|Richard Newland]]'s XI in 1745.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley-Cooper, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowra is believed to have been a shepherd employed by [[John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset]] to explain his title of "The Kentish Shepherd", under which he headed an eleven against "Long Tom" (i.e., [[Tom Faulkner]]) of Surrey on [[Kennington Common]] in 1747.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier that season, he was a member of [[Robert Colchin]]'s XI against [[William Hodsoll]]'s XI.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley-Cooper, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowra's final recorded appearance was in 1749 when he again represented Colchin's XI against [[Stephen Dingate]]'s XI.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley-Cooper, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
[[William Bowra]], who played in the latter part of the 18th century, is believed to have been his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1731.html |title=From Lads to Lord's |accessdate=2012-10-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140105/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1731.html#bowraj |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sport of [[Australian rules football]], a '''kick-in''' (sometimes known as a '''kick-out''') occurs when an opposition team scores a [[Behind (Australian rules football)|behind]], with a defender kicking the ball out from the defensive [[goalsquare]]. The team kicking in may elect any one of its players to take the kick-in. The man on the mark stands five metres in front of the goal square. The player kicking in is given approximately ten to fifteen seconds from when they pick up the ball to take their kick before the umpire will call play-on, at which point the man on the mark may advance. Players kicking in may either kick to a teammate, or kick to themselves to allow themselves to play on. Whichever option is taken, the player must kick from wholly within the white lines of the goal square, even if the umpire has already called play-on for taking too much time - if their foot touches the line of the goal square, then play is stopped and the umpire will [[Ball-up|bounce the ball]] at the centre of the kick-off line.

If a kick-in goes out of bounds without being touched by another player, the boundary umpire will signal [[out on the full]] and award a free kick to the opposition, whether or not the ball has bounced before going out. This is to prevent teams from getting their longest kicker to [[kick for touch]]. Kicking to oneself satisfies the kick-in condition, so any further kick taken will be treated normally.

Historically, kick-in strategy would be that the team's longest kicker would send the ball as far down the field as possible, resulting in a marking contest; this way, even if an opponent took a contested mark, they would be one long kick plus ten metres away from the goal line, and would be hence unlikely to score. The 1970s saw the birth of the [[huddle]], which pioneered the act of pinpointing a shorter pass to a teammate.

In the modern game a quick kick-in exists when a behind is scored in a largely vacant forward-line; the rule change (see below) means that the opposition cannot man up, and the first couple of kicks generally come very easily. For non-quick kick-ins, huddles are sometimes used, which require man coverage. Otherwise, zone coverage is most common. Some teams will set their players up 25-50m out from goal, and these teams aim to take a couple of safe short passes to progress 30m down the field, at which stage the field is wider and the downfield options are more free. Other teams set up a longer kick-in, leaving the first 30m largely vacant. Teams who do this will seek to find a 40-50m pass on the lead; if no leads are available, then the player will kick to himself and begin to run into the empty space, forcing the downfield options into a wider area and potentially an easier pass.

==Rule changes==
In [[2005 AFL season|2005]], a player who kicked to themselves from the kick-in was allowed to do so by a simple tap-kick (kicking the ball clear of hand and foot). Prior to this season, the kick must have begun behind the white line, and ended over it; this was deemed to be an irrelevant technicality, and was accordingly removed.
In [[2006 AFL season|2006]], new [[2006 AFL rule changes|rule changes]] meant that a player did not have to wait for the [[Goal Umpire]]'s flags to be waved before kicking out, and could kick out as soon as a [[Behind (Australian rules football)|behind]] was signalled. This sped up the flow of the game significantly but angered some.

The '''Malawi national netball team''', nicknamed "The Queens", represent [[Malawi]] in international [[netball]] competition. 

==History==
Malawi have played in five [[World Netball Championships]], famously finishing fifth in [[2007 World Netball Championships|2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gay |first=Edward |date=17 November 2007 |title=Jubilant Malawi finish fifth |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10476685 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queens are coached by Whyte Mlilima, who was appointed as caretaker head coach after former coach Griffin Saenda had to withdraw from the team with medical problems.&lt;ref name=Mbewe/&gt; As of January 2018, the team are sixth in the [[INF World Rankings]].

In 2012 they competed in the [[2012 Fast5 Netball World Series|Fast5]] tournament in [[Auckland]], where they have had several historic results including wins over [[Australian national netball team|Australia]] and [[England national netball team|England]], and finished in 5th place, just narrowly missing out on the finals. This followed a draw against Australia in the [[2010 World Netball Series|2010 Edition]]. Airtel Malawi is a significant financial donor of the Malawi Queens, having sponsored their trip to Auckland for the Fast5 World Series in 2014 to a sum of K6 M.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faceofmalawi.com/2014/10/airtel-mw-sponsors-malawi-queens-with-k6-m/ Face of Malawi, Oct 29, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The current Netball Association of Malawi (NAM) president is Carol Bapu.

At the [[Netball at the 2018 Commonwealth Games|2018 Commonwealth Games]], Malawi defeated the second-ranked team in the world, [[New Zealand national netball team|New Zealand]], for the first time in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/commonwealth-games/minnows-malawi-shock-silver-ferns-to-leave-new-zealand-in-danger-of-missing-commonwealth-games-glory/news-story/6bcc0c8ef317b46f2af0048b080f7d47|title=Minnows Malawi shock Silver Ferns to leave New Zealand in danger of missing Commonwealth Games glory|work=News.com.au|date=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''North Wilkesboro Speedway''' was a [[Short track motor racing|short track]] that held races in [[NASCAR]]'s top three series, including 93 Winston Cup Series races. The track, a NASCAR original, operated from 1949, NASCAR's inception, until the track's closure in 1996. The speedway briefly reopened in 2010 and hosted several Stock Car Series races, including the now-defunct [[ASA Late Model Series]], [[CARS X-1R Pro Cup Series|USARacing Pro Cup Series]], and PASS Super Late Models, before closing forever in the spring of 2011. The track is located on [[U.S. Route 421]], about five miles east of the town of [[North Wilkesboro, North Carolina|North Wilkesboro]], [[North Carolina]]. It measured {{convert|0.625|mi|km}} and featured a unique uphill backstretch and downhill frontstretch.

==History==

===Before the Speedway===

Years before the 1948 founding of [[NASCAR]], [[Wilkes County, North Carolina|Wilkes County]] and the surrounding areas were known as the Moonshine Capital of America. The local economy was pushed toward liquor after the Great Depression had stripped the profitability of farming and the region's undulating topography offered places to hide liquor stills during the Prohibition Era. Its location in the foothills of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] was also convenient for distillers and distributors of moonshine. North Wilkesboro native &amp; NASCAR driver Benny Parsons recalled of the era "Trust me, there was nothing to do in the mountains of North Carolina back in the 30s, 40s, and 50s.  You either worked at a hosiery mill, a furniture factory, or you made whiskey."

===Early Years===
In 1945, Enoch Staley attended a stock car race in South Carolina sponsored by [[Bill France Sr.|Bill France]]. Enoch was inspired by the races&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sometimes-interesting.com/2017/02/12/north-wilkesboro-speedway-defunct-pillar-of-nascar |title=North Wilkesboro Speedway, Defunct Pillar of NASCAR |date=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was impressed by the large crowds attending the new sport. So he decided to build a track in his native [[Wilkes County, North Carolina|Wilkes County]], and he asked Bill France to promote the races and assist with their operation.

Enoch and his partners, Lawson Curry, Jack Combs, and Charlie Combs, purchased farmland near [[North Wilkesboro]] and began building an oval racetrack. When their initial investment of $1,500 was exhausted, they were forced to amend the original design of the track, hence the completed track was not a perfect oval. The front stretch was left with a downhill slope, and the backstretch had an uphill slope. Construction was completed in late 1946.

North Wilkesboro Speedway opened its doors on May 18, 1947 as a dirt track. Bill France promoted the first official event as a Modified race, including heat races and a feature race. While an attendance of about 3,000 people was expected, a crowd in excess of 10,000 was in attendance to see one of the famous Flock&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decadesofracing.net/FontyFlock.htm Fonty Flock Profile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512111235/http://www.decadesofracing.net/FontyFlock.htm |date=May 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; brothers win the race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethespeedway.net/may47.html First Race at North Wilkesboro Speedway] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513111041/http://www.savethespeedway.net/may47.html |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 1949, North Wilkesboro Speedway held the [[1949 Wilkes 200|eighth and final race of the 1949 NASCAR Strictly Stock Division]]. Kenneth Wagner won the first Cup Pole at the track with a speed of 57.563&amp;nbsp;mph on the dirt surface. A total of 22 drivers competed in the race. Bob Flock, in his Bob Christian-owned 1949 Oldsmobile, passed Bill Blair's fading Cadillac with 20 laps to go and won by about 100 yards over Lee Petty. At the end of the day Robert "Red" Byron walked away as the first NASCAR champion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethespeedway.net/49wilkes.htm October 16, 1949 - Wilkes 200] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928203344/http://www.savethespeedway.net/49wilkes.htm |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1950s===
North Wilkesboro carried a reputation as one of the fastest short-tracks in auto racing in the late 1940s and 1950s. In 1950, speeds reached 73&amp;nbsp;mph at the track, compared to the next fastest short-track, Charlotte Speedway, where top speeds only reached 66&amp;nbsp;mph. Most of the fans in the early years of the sport saw the track as notorious for being a great venue to watch races between the legendary racers of the time. Racing at North Wilkesboro was intense and physical.

The 1950 Wilkes 200 was the second [[Sprint Cup Series|Grand National Series]] race held at North Wilkesboro Speedway. Twenty-six cars entered the race. Twenty-one-year-old [[Fireball Roberts]] qualified with a lap speed of 73.266&amp;nbsp;mph on the dirt track for his first ever Grand National pole, but engine problems dropped him out of the running. [[Fonty Flock]] started in the third position and led the most laps in the race with 104, but engine troubles also ended his day. Ultimately, Leon Sales led eight of the 200 laps to become the victor,  the fourth NASCAR driver to win an event in his debut race. Jack Smith finished second after leading 55 laps in the race.

After hosting only one NASCAR event in 1949 and one in 1950, the track began running two [[Sprint Cup Series|Grand National Series]] events per year in 1951 (with the exception of 1956, when only one race was held; the track was being prepared for pavement). [[First Union 400|One]] race was held in the spring, normally in late March or early April, and another was held in the fall, normally in late September or early October. In 1957, owner Enoch Stanley had the 5/8-mile track paved.

The Wilkes 200 in 1952 turned into a battle between brothers. Two sets of brothers competed in the race, and they took the top four spots at the finish. The Flock Brothers ([[Fonty Flock]] and [[Tim Flock]]) were strong, but the Thomas brothers ([[Herb Thomas]] and [[Donald Thomas (racing driver)|Donald Thomas]]) had the better outcome. Herb Thomas, driving his 1952 "Fabulous" Hudson Hornet, won the pole, led 192 of the 200 laps, and grabbed the victory. Fonty Flock led the first eight laps and finished the race second. Donald Thomas, also in a 1952 "Fabulous" Hudson Hornet, finished third, and Tim Flock finished fourth. Eleven of the 27 cars entered in the race finished. Six of the top nine positions were driving Hudson Hornets.

[[Herb Thomas]] started on the pole for the 1953 Wilkes 200 with his record-setting qualifying speed of 78.424&amp;nbsp;mph on the dirt surface. Outside pole sitter Tim Flock led the first 100 laps before experiencing engine problems. [[Curtis Turner]] took the lead on Lap 101 and continued the lead until his car also succumbed to engine troubles nine laps later. Thomas in his Number 92 Hudson Hornet only lead 18 laps in the race but ended the race by taking his third consecutive win at North Wilkesboro. Starting from the third spot, [[Dick Rathmann]] led 70 laps and finished behind Herb Thomas. [[Fonty Flock]] managed to work his way up from the fourth starting position to the front and led three laps before dropping back and finishing third.

Pole sitter [[Buck Baker]] ran 78.288&amp;nbsp;mph to gap the pole for the 1953 Wilkes 160. Baker ran strong and led the most laps in the race with 80 out front before falling back into sixth position at the finish. [[Speedy Thompson]] led 25 laps, and Fonty Flock led 37. [[Curtis Turner]] led a total of 18 laps. At the end of the race, Thompson finished two laps ahead of second-place Flock. Thompson's win ended [[Herb Thomas]] and his [[Hudson Hornet]]'s three-race winning streak at North Wilkesboro.

At the 1954 Wilkes County 160, [[Gober Sosebee]] won the pole with a lap speed of 78.698&amp;nbsp;mph. Sosebee led a race-high 112 laps but finished in 12th position, eight laps down. The only other leader was [[Dick Rathmann]], who led 48 laps. Rathmann blew a tire while leading, with three laps to go, and still managed to finish and win the race. Herb Thomas finished some 20 seconds behind in second place.

In the 1954 Wilkes 160, [[Hershel McGriff]] won the pole with a qualifying speed of 77.612&amp;nbsp;mph. He and [[Dick Rathman]] were the only leaders of the race; McGriff led 74 laps, and Rathman led 83. The race was called three laps early because of a serious crash involving Lou Figaro; his car flipped, and the roof caved in. Figaro was transported to a hospital in [[Winston-Salem]], but he died the following day from a skull fracture and brain damage suffered in the crash. McGriff was declared the winner. It was his final victory and his last Grand National race for 17 years.

[[Dink Widenhouse]] won his only career [[Sprint Cup Series|Grand National Series]] pole at the 1955 Wilkes County 160. Engine problems, however, landed Widenhouse out of the race. Outside pole sitter [[Buck Baker]] led all 160 laps, but by the last lap [[Dick Rathmann]] was glued to Baker's bumper, still charging. Rathmann's final charge off of Turn Four came up three feet short of stealing the victory. It was the closest finish in series history up to that time. Local native [[Junior Johnson]] ran in his first Grand National race at North Wilkesboro.

In 1956, the Wilkes County 160 was the only [[Sprint Cup Series|Grand National Series]] race of the season, and it was the last race on dirt at North Wilkesboro. [[Junior Johnson|Junior Johnson's]] 1956 Pontiac started from the pole and led the first 17 laps before engine problems sidelined him. Outside pole qualifier [[Speedy Thompson]] took over the lead from there until fuel line problems on Lap 114 forced him out of the race. [[Tim Flock]] led the final 46 laps, earning his first win at North Wilkesboro. After the race, Flock announced to [[Carl Kiekhafer]] that this would be the last time he would drive one of Kiekhafer's cars. Billy Myers was the runner-up.

The Wilkes County 160 in 1957 was dominated by the [[Pete DePaolo]] Fords. DePaolo entered five 1957 Fords in the race, and they all finished in the top six positions. [[Fireball Roberts]] put his DePaolo Ford on the pole with a qualifying speed of 81.5&amp;nbsp;mph. It was the first time the pole sitter had a speed over 80&amp;nbsp;mph. Roberts was the only driver to lead during the race, leading all 160 laps. Roberts won the race without making a single pit stop. DePaolo's other drivers were second-place finisher [[Paul Goldsmith]], third place [[Ralph Moody]], fourth place [[Marvin Panch]], and sixth place Allen Adkins. [[Buck Baker]]'s was the only non-Depaolo car in the top six. He finished in fifth place.

The Wilkes 160 of 1957 was Junior Johnson's first race after spending 11 months in jail for his moonshining activities. It was also his only start of the 1957 [[Sprint Cup Series|Grand National Series]] season. [[Fireball Roberts]] won the pole with a lap speed of 81.64&amp;nbsp;mph. Jack Smith passed [[Banjo Matthews]] with ten laps to go, holding off [[Lee Petty]] for the victory. Tragedy struck on Lap 47 when [[Tiny Lund]]'s axle snapped. One of the wheels broke loose, hitting spectators. One spectator was injured, and another, William R. Thomasson, was killed.

The NASCAR Convertible Series ran two races at North Wilkesboro. In 1957, [[Ken Rush]] won the pole and led the first 21 laps before [[Glen Wood]] took the lead for the next 42 laps. Paul Goldsmith took the lead on Lap 64 and led the rest of the 160-lap race. In 1958, Roz Howard won the pole but never led a lap. Billy Myers took the lead on Lap One and continued until Lap 82 when he was passed by [[Gwyn Staley]]. Billy Myers retook the lead on Lap 119 and lead the rest of the race.

In 1959 North Wilkesboro's spring race, the Wilkes County 160, was renamed the Gwyn Staley 160 in memory of Enoch Staley's younger brother. [[Gwyn Staley]] was killed in a convertible race at Richmond 12 days before the running of the Wilkes County 160. The race remained in Gwyn Staley's name until 1978. [[Lee Petty]] won the inaugural Gwyn Staley 160, His first North Wilkesboro win, driving a Petty Enterprises #43 car. It was his only victory driving a #43 car, a number later made famous by his son [[Richard Petty]].

===The 1960s===

Through the 1960s and 1970s the NASCAR [[Sprint Cup Series|Grand National Series]] began focusing on bigger, faster, and longer tracks. Like other short tracks in NASCAR at the time, crowd capacity and purses were small compared to the larger tracks. Over time, Enoch Staley and Jack Combs attempted to keep the facility modern and on pace with the growth of the sport. The West Grandstand was rebuilt with chair-type seats rather than the old bare concrete slabs. New larger restroom facilities were built, and the South Grandstand was expanded. A garage facility was also built within the track, which at the time was rare for short-track venues. But the main focus was on keeping ticket prices affordable. Food and beverage prices were kept low, and event parking and camping were always free. As long as profits covered maintenance costs, Staley was satisfied with the income of the track.

In the Gwyn Staley 160 of 1960, Junior Johnson beat 21 other drivers for the pole position with a lap speed of 83.860&amp;nbsp;mph. [[Glen Wood]] overtook Johnson to lead the first lap, but Johnson had the race under control and led the next 145 laps. [[Lee Petty]] moved up from the eighth starting position to challenge Johnson late in the race. With 14 laps remaining, Johnson and Petty made contact. Johnson's car was sent spinning into the guardrail. Petty lead the final 14 laps to win his third straight race at North Wilkesboro. The crowd of 9,200 pelted Petty with bottles, rocks, and debris after his win; he had done their local hero wrong. When Petty took the microphone in Victory Lane to explain his side of the story, the crowd began jeering. [[Rex White]] finished second, and Wood placed third. [[Ned Jarrett]] finished fourth under the alias John Lentz.

The length of the fall race in 1960 was increased from its usual 160 laps / 100 miles to 320 laps / 200 miles, this it became known as the Wilkes 320. Speeds increased immensely from the previous record, 1.83 seconds quicker than any previous qualifying lap (86.806 to 93.399&amp;nbsp;mph). [[Rex White]] posted the fastest qualifying lap and dethroned [[Lee Petty]] from his three-race winning streak at North Wilkesboro. Junior Johnson finished about half a lap behind White in second place.

In the 1961 running of the Gwyn Staley 400, Junior Johnson recorded another pole, this time by 0.57 seconds better than the previous track record, with his qualifying time of 23.52 (95.660&amp;nbsp;mph). Johnson led all of the 62 laps he ran before transmission problems forced him out of the race. [[Fred Lorenzen]] led the next 61 laps until engine problems took him out of the running. And [[Curtis Turner]] led 56 laps before experiencing problems as well. 1960 Grand National Champion [[Rex White]], who started on the outside pole, led the remaining 221 laps and won the race. Tommy Irwin started the race in sixth position and finished the Gwyn Staley 400 two laps behind White. [[Richard Petty]] followed in third place. [[Fireball Roberts]], in a Pontiac owned by [[Smokey Yunick]], finished fourth (ten laps down), and [[Johnny Allen (racing driver)|Johnny Allen]], who crashed out of the race on his 387th lap, still finished in fifth place. Only 12 of the 25 cars that entered the race were running at the finish of the first 400-lap edition of the Gwyn Staley race.

In the 1963 Wilkes 400, [[Fred Lorenzen]] captured his third straight pole at the track by breaking his own record with a lap time of 23.30 seconds / 96.566&amp;nbsp;mph. [[Richard Petty]] entered the race in an attempt to become the first driver to win four consecutive races at North Wilkesboro. But he experienced engine problems and lasted only 45 laps into the race. Lorenzen led 58 laps, but came up short of victory, six seconds behind winner [[Marvin Panch]]. Panch did not start the 1963 season until halfway through because he had nearly lost his life in a crash while testing a Maserati at Daytona that February. Panch, in a Wood Brothers car, started third and led 131 laps in the race. Holman-Moody took the next three spots in the final rundown, with Lorenzen second, [[Nelson Stacy]] third, and [[Fireball Roberts]] fourth. Stacy started fourth and led 56 laps, while Roberts started from the outside pole and led the most laps with 155.

The track was repaved just prior to the Gwyn Staley 400 in 1964, and the resulting lack of traction wreaked havoc. [[Fireball Roberts]], [[Buck Baker]], [[Buddy Arrington]], and [[G.C. Spencer]] all crashed through the wooden guardrail in the first and second turns in Saturday's practice and qualifying. Roberts was unable to start the race because his Ford had been so heavily damaged. [[Fred Lorenzen]] won the pole and led 368 laps on the way to the win.

Junior Johnson was the pole sitter for the 1965 Gwyn Staley 400, with a qualifying time and speed of 22.27 seconds / 101.033&amp;nbsp;mph, breaking his own record by 0.06 seconds. [[Marvin Panch]] was leading the race when a blown tire caused him to crash with 11 laps remaining. Johnson assumed the lead from there and won his third of 13 wins in 1965. Johnson lead during most of the race, 356 laps in total. [[Bobby Johns]] in a [[Holman-Moody]] Ford finished in the runner-up position, seven seconds behind Johnson. Finishing third, one lap down, was [[Ned Jarrett]]. Jarrett had led 20 laps early in the race. Dick Hutcherson, in his [[Holman-Moody]] Ford, finished seven laps off the pace in fourth place, and Panch finished fifth. Panch led on three occasions during the race for a total of 24 laps.

In the Wilkes 400 of 1965, [[Fred Lorenzen]] won the pole and led the first 190 laps before engine problems forced him out of the race on Lap 219. Junior Johnson took the lead from the fading Lorenzen to pick up his 50th and final [[Sprint Cup Series|Grand National Series]] victory by two laps over [[Cale Yarborough]]. Only 16 of the 35 cars that entered the race were running at the finish.

[[Jim Paschal]] started the 1966 Gwyn Staley 400 from the pole position with a record lap time and speed of 21.91 sec / 102.693&amp;nbsp;mph. Paschal led 308 laps and won by six laps over [[G.C. Spencer]], the largest margin of victory at North Wilkesboro in a [[Sprint Cup Series|Grand National Series]] race. [[David Pearson (racing driver)|David Pearson]] started on the outside pole, and despite losing an engine with 18 laps to go he finished third. [[Wendell Scott]] finished fourth (22 laps down), and Clarence Henly Gray finished fifth (25 laps down). Only 14 of the 37 cars entered in the race were running at the finish. [[Richard Petty]] was the only driver besides Paschal to lead any laps in the race. He led 92 laps before falling back to finish 11th (53 laps down).

[[Darel Dieringer]] completely dominated the 1967 Gwyn Staley 400, driving for Junior Johnson. Dieringer got the pole with a lap of 21.50 seconds / 104.693&amp;nbsp;mph and lead all 400 laps. He was the first driver to run a [[Sprint Cup Series|Grand National Series]] race of over 250 miles while leading from start to finish. He lapped the whole field twice at one point. Dieringer took the checked flag after he ran out of gas in Turn Four of the last lap and coasted to the finish line. This was Dieringer's last Grand National victory. [[Cale Yarborough]], driving the No. 21 Wood Brothers Ford, finished second, one lap behind Dieringer. A 20-lap qualifying race to make the field was won by Clyde Lynn.

In the Wilkes 400 of 1967, [[Richard Petty]] achieved an historic tenth straight win, his 27th win of the season, at North Wilkesboro. Prior to the start of the race, Petty's car had a flat tire, but he was able to recover and win by two laps over pole winner [[Dick Hutcherson]]. Only 15 of the 35 cars that started the race were able to finish.

===The 1970s===
Three drivers entered the 1970 Wilkes 400 in a very close points race. [[Bobby Isaac]] was just ahead of [[James Hylton]], and [[Bobby Allison]] was close behind. But [[Richard Petty]], who was out of the points because of a shoulder injury suffered at Darlington in May, was considered the favorite to win the race. Isaac started from the pole for a record-tying fourth consecutive time, matching Fred Lorenzen and Herb Thomas with a qualifying lap time of 21.346 seconds / 105.406&amp;nbsp;mph. Fans were given quite a show as Isaac and Petty exchanged the lead a total of 11 times throughout the race. Isaac, in the [[Nord Krauskopf]]'s K&amp;K Insurance Dodge, led 179 laps and took the win by six car lengths over Petty. Petty, who had started the race in third position led the most laps in the race with 216. Bobby Allison started fourth and finished fourth behind his brother, [[Donnie Allison]]. And Hylton finished fifth at the end of day. Isaac advanced to become the 1970 Winston Cup Champion at season's end, with Allison being the runner-up in points.

Bad weather in 1971 caused the Wilkes 400 to be postponed to November 21. Due to the [[Sprint Cup Series|Grand National Series]]' struggling car counts, cars from NASCAR's Grand American Series were allowed to run in this race. [[Charlie Glotzbach]] broke the track record in qualifying at 20.919 seconds / 107.558&amp;nbsp;mph. It was the first lap ever run under 21 seconds at  North Wilkesboro, ending [[Bobby Isaac]]'s run of five consecutive poles at the track. [[Tiny Lund]], driving a 1970 Camaro, qualified sixth and led just seven laps on his way to the victory. Lund also won another race driving the Camaro that season at Hickory. Glotzbach finished second, six seconds behind Lund, after leading 76 laps in the race. [[Richard Petty]] started from the outside pole and led 306 laps to finish third. [[Dave Marcis]] finished fourth, two laps down, and [[Benny Parsons]] rounded out the top five. [[Bobby Allison]] was the only other driver to lead, running 11 laps out front before losing an engine prior to the half.

The Wilkes 400 in 1972 was one of the wildest finishes in [[NASCAR Cup Series]] history. [[Buddy Baker]] won the pole in the No. 71 K&amp;K Insurance Dodge owned by [[Nord Krauskopf]], but he only led the first lap of the race. [[Richard Petty]] and [[Bobby Allison]] swapped the lead for the rest of the race, beating and banging each other for the win. At times was more of a demolition derby than a race. Both cars were destroyed by the end, with Allison's car noticeably smoking. This was the peak of the Petty-Allison rivalry. Petty was declared the winner, but in Victory Lane, a fan tried to attack him. But he was defended by his helmet-wielding brother, [[Maurice Petty]]. This was Richard Petty's last of 137 wins in a Plymouth.

In the Gwyn Staley 400 of 1973, [[Bobby Allison]] landed on the pole with a qualifying lap of 21.077 seconds / 106.750 MPH. [[Richard Petty]] qualified on the outside pole, and in dominating fashion he led 386 laps, winning by over four laps. It was Petty's tenth career win at North Wilkesboro and his 151st career NASCAR victory. [[Benny Parsons]] led six laps and finished second. [[Buddy Baker]] finished third in the No. 71 K&amp;K Insurance Dodge owned by [[Nord Krauskopf]]. Allison lead seven laps and finished fourth in the race. Cecil Gordon rounded out the top five finishers. [[Yvon DuHamel]], a top AMA road racer from Quebec, drove a Mercury prepared by [[Junie Donlavey]] and finished in tenth place in his only career Cup race. Twenty of the 30 cars that entered the race were running at the finish.

In the Wilkes 400 of 1973 [[Bobby Allison]], driving for his own No. 12 Coca-Cola team, won the pole position. He and [[Richard Petty]] led most of the race, Allison with 161 and Petty with 222. As Petty led the race late, Allison pitted and got fresh tires on a late pit stop, running down Petty and passing him on the final lap. It was considered as one of the most exciting races ever at North Wilkesboro Speedway.

In 1975 the [[NASCAR]] [[Baby Grand Series]], later known as Goody's Dash Series, ran its first race at North Wilkesboro, with a win by [[Dean Combs]]. Thirty-seven races were run at the track from 1975-1984,1986-1987, and 1995-1996. Dean Combs had the most wins at the track with 15 victories.

In the Gwyn Staley 400 of 1977, [[Cale Yarborough]] became the first driver to win a [[NASCAR Cup Series]] race on his birthday. [[Neil Bonnett]] beat Yarborough for the pole, but in the race Yarborough led 320 laps on the way to his birthday victory. Only the top three, Yarborough, [[Richard Petty]] and [[Benny Parsons]] finished on the lead lap.

In the Wilkes 400 of 1978, [[Darrell Waltrip]] won the pole in his No. 88 Gatorade DiGard team Chevrolet. Waltrip led the first 381 laps of the 400-lap race. But with 19 laps remaining, [[Cale Yarborough]] passed Waltrip and took the win. Yarborough and Waltrip were the only drivers to finish on the lead lap in the 27-car field. This ninth win of the season for Yarborough virtually locked his third straight NASCAR Cup Series championship driving for car owner Junior Johnson.

In the Northwestern Bank 400 of 1979, [[Benny Parsons]] won the pole. [[Richard Petty]] led the most laps with 211, but it was [[Bobby Allison]] who passed Petty and led the final 47 laps. The suspension on Allison's No. 15 Ford collapsed as he crossed the finish line on the final lap of the race, leading to a smokey victory lap as the car threw sparks. But by that time he had already won and was headed to Victory Lane. [[Dale Earnhardt]] tied for fourth, his best finish at that point in his career. He won his first race in the very next event at Bristol.

The Holly Farms 400 in 1979 was the first time the fall race had a sponsor. Holly Farms would be the name of the track's fall races from this event until the track's final race in 1996. The race was scheduled to be run September 30, but heavy rains and worms seeping onto the track surface plagued the entire weekend. So the race was rescheduled for the next available weekend, October 14. Dale Earnhardt broke the 20-second barrier during qualifying and claimed the pole position. With a new asphalt surface on the track, 14 drivers ended up topping the previous qualifying record. [[Bobby Allison]] led the most laps in the race with 175, and [[Darrell Waltrip]] led 104. After Waltrip bumped Allison out of the lead, Waltrip was wrecked on Lap 311, when Allison put him into the wall. Waltrip began crowding out Allison under the caution before officials black-flagged him. Wilkes County local, [[Benny Parsons]], ended the day in Victory Lane after leading the final 92 laps. It was Parsons' first and only win at his hometown track.

===The 1980s===

During the 1980s the track was noticeably lagging behind other speedways on the NASCAR circuit, but the fans were more interested in the great racing action between the legendary drivers. Enoch's focus was more on the fans' enjoyment rather than on building large suites and new facilities. Attendance and total purse for races at the track were the lowest in NASCAR, but the events continued to sell out and attract more fans each year.

In the 1981 Northwestern Bank 400, [[Dave Marcis]], driving an unpainted car, won the pole with a lap record of 19.483 sec / 115.485&amp;nbsp;mph on the newly repaved track. The lap was 0.241 seconds faster than the previous record set by Dale Earnhardt one year earlier. A 22-year-old newcomer, [[Mark Martin]], made his [[NASCAR Cup Series]] debut with a quick qualifying run, starting fifth. But he ended up dropping out 166 laps into the race with rear end problems and finished 27th. [[Bobby Allison]] was up front, leading the most laps with 186. Marcis stayed up front and led 123 laps but fell off the pace late in the race when his tires wore out. [[Richard Petty]] took the lead and led the final 62 laps for his 194th career win. This was Petty's 15th and final win at North Wilkesboro, the most Cup wins at the track. It was also Petty's 107th and final win on a short track. The top five finishers behind Petty were Allison, [[Darrell Waltrip]], Marcis, and [[Harry Gant]].

[[Darrell Waltrip]] dominated the Holly Farms 400 of 1981. He started on the pole, leading 318. He lapped the field on the way to the win, beginning a streak of five straight wins at the track. [[Bobby Allison]] finished second, one lap down after leading 76 laps. Other leaders in the race were [[Jody Ridley]] leading four laps, [[Dave Marcis]] with one lap, and [[Richard Petty]] with one.

The Northwestern Bank 400 of 1982 was [[ESPN]]'s first broadcast at North Wilkesboro Speedway. [[Bob Jenkins]] and [[Ned Jarrett]] called the race, with [[Ron Kendrick]] as the pit reporter. They broadcast every North Wilkesboro race afterward until the final race there in the fall of 1996. Bobby Hillin Jr., at 17 years old, made his first career start and set the record for the youngest driver (A 1998 rule change raised the minimum age in NASCAR to 18, meaning this record is unlikely to be broken) to start a NASCAR Winston Cup race. [[Darrell Waltrip]] won the race from the pole, leading 345 laps.

The 1982 Holly Farms 400 was a total domination by [[Darrell Waltrip]] and the Junior Johnson team. Waltrip started the weekend by gaining his third straight pole at the track with a qualifying lap of 19.761 sec / 113.860&amp;nbsp;mph. He led 329 laps in the race. [[Bobby Allison]] was the only driver who could stay close to the No. 11 team. As the only other leader in the race, Allison led 71 laps but was forced out by engine problems after 141 laps. Only Waltrip and [[Harry Gant]] finished the race on the lead lap. It was Waltrip's third straight NASCAR Cup Series win at North Wilkesboro.

In the spring of 1983, NASCAR ran its first Busch race at North Wilkesboro. [[Tommy Ellis]] won the pole with a qualifying speed of 116.692&amp;nbsp;mph. Ellis led the first 15 laps before being passed by [[Butch Lindley]]. [[Sam Ard]] got the lead from Lindley on Lap 34 and led the rest of the 200-lap race. Only ten of the 23 cars finished the race. That fall, [[Phil Parsons]] won the pole for the second Busch race. [[Jack Ingram]] led a race-high 126 laps, but Tommy Ellis took the win. Only one event was held in 1984, with Sam Ard winning his final Busch race. [[Tommy Houston]] won the pole in 1985 for the last Busch race, with Jack Ingram taking the win.

[[Darrell Waltrip]] and Junior Johnson enjoyed a big win in the 1983 Holly Farms 400. It was Waltrip's fifth straight win at the track and Johnson's 100th career NASCAR Cup Series win as an owner, which just happened to take place at his home track within ten miles of his home and farm. Waltrip got the pole and led 252 laps on the way to victory. Dale Earnhardt was runner-up in the race with 134 laps out front.

The Northwestern Bank 400 of 1984 was dominated by [[Ricky Rudd]], who got the pole and led 290 laps. But at the end of the race, [[Tim Richmond]] had a better pit stop to beat Ricky Rudd out of the win. Richmond's victory broke [[Darrell Waltrip]]'s five-race winning streak at North Wilkesboro.

In the 1986 First Union 400, [[Geoffrey Bodine]] started on the pole. On Lap 85, [[Trevor Boys]] crashed out of the race and blocked the entrance to Pit Road, but no caution flag was thrown. Instead, a wrecker was sent out on the bottom of the track to haul Boys out of the way under green-flag conditions. Dale Earnhardt won the race and led 195 laps, followed by [[Ricky Rudd]] in second place with 102.

The Holly Farms 400 of 1988 was a rough race. [[Ricky Rudd]] led 154 laps, and Dale Earnhardt led 107. A beating and banging match started between them, and NASCAR sent them both to the rear of the field with less than 40 laps to go. For the remainder of the race they continued to beat and bang on each other. On the last lap, [[Geoffrey Bodine]] gave [[Rusty Wallace]] a shot and drove around him in Turn One. But when the two got around to Turn Three, Wallace returned the shot and passed Bodine for the win.

The 1989 First Union 400 was the first NASCAR Cup Series race for Goodyear radial tires. Dale Earnhardt won the race on the Goodyear tires after [[Rusty Wallace]] grabbed the pole on Hoosier bias ply tires. Earnhardt led 296 out of 400 laps. In the end, Earnhardt and [[Alan Kulwicki]] battled it out hard for the last couple of laps until Kulwicki ran up the track trying to pass Earnhardt on the outside with four laps left.

In the 1989 Holly Farms 400, Dale Earnhardt entered the race only 35 points behind [[Rusty Wallace]] for the NASCAR Cup Series championship with four races left. The race was originally scheduled for October 1, but rain caused a two-week postponement. Earnhardt got the pole position because inclement weather had washed out the qualifying runs. This is the only Cup race at North Wilkesboro to start without qualifiers. Earnhardt dominated the race, leading 343 laps. On the final restart on Lap 398, Earnhardt led [[Ricky Rudd]], [[Geoff Bodine]], [[Terry Labonte]], and [[Mark Martin]]. [[Ricky Rudd|Rudd]] was in pursuit of Earnhardt on the last lap going into the first turn. He went low, and Earnhardt tried to keep a tight line through the corner to hold the lead. They made contact and both cars went spinning, as Geoff Bodine went around to gap the win by leading only the last lap in the race. The last-lap contact also produced some of the most memorable broadcasting quotes in NASCAR history. After the race, [[Dick Berggren]] asked Earnhardt, "How will this affect your championship? You've got three more to go." Earnhardt responded, "What do ya think? They oughta fine that son of a bitch and make him sit out the rest of the year, I dunno." Earnhardt ended up losing the championship by 12 points to Wallace.

===The 1990s===

By the 1990s, North Wilkesboro was like a part of the past. Enoch had always had the fans' interests at heart, and he was reluctant to raise ticket and concession prices or charge spectators additional fees to make facility improvements. Track amenities were seen as out-of-date and lagging behind the other more modern facilities. Parking was overcrowded and tight, traffic jams plagued the two-lane roads leading to the facility, and hotel and motel rooms were hard to find in the area. NASCAR crowds and TV contracts had outgrown the Speedway. NASCAR had continued to expand and grow more in the economy. Bigger TV deals and larger coverage of the races and new, bigger sponsors were growing in the sport, as North Wilkesboro races continued with the lowest crowd capacity, 60,000 in its best years, in all of the [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]]. Winners purses were normally still under $100,000.

Controversy erupted at the end of the 1990 First Union 400. [[Mark Martin]] had started the race from the pole, and [[Darrell Waltrip]] was in the lead when a caution came out late for [[Kenny Wallace]] right as the last round of green flag pit stops was completed. [[Brett Bodine]] was on the tail-end of the lead lap. Since NASCAR didn't have electronic scoring until 1993, the pace car picked Brett Bodine up as the leader. The next 17 laps were run under the yellow, while the officials checked the lap charts and tried to sort everything out. By the time NASCAR realized its mistake and waved the rest of the field around the pace car to fall in behind race leader Bodine, Bodine had already pitted and gotten four fresh ties under yellow during all the confusion. Bodine was able to stay out front with the freshest tires. He led the rest of the race after the green came back out and picked up the win. Darrell Waltrip was very upset after the race and protested Bodine's win, but NASCAR declined the protest and Bodine keep the win. It turned out to be Bodine's only career win and Larry McReynold's first oval track win as a crew chief after two road course victories with [[Ricky Rudd]] in the late 1980s. It was also the last [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]] win for [[Buick]].

Dale Earnhardt dominated the 1990 Tyson Holly Farms 400, leading 291 laps. At one point, Earnhardt even passed [[Mark Martin]] for the lead down Pit Road to beat him out of the pits. No Pit Road speed limit was in place at the time. [[Kyle Petty]] had won the pole and led 64 laps early in the race. But in the end, Martin made a key adjustment on his last pit stop. He took off and ran away to gain the victory. Just hours after the race, rookie [[Rob Moroso]] was killed in a highway crash on the way home. Moroso became the only rookie to win the [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]] Rookie of the Year honors posthumously.

In the 1991 First Union 400, [[Brett Bodine]] beat [[Alan Kulwicki]] for the pole. This was the first Winston Cup race held with a Pit Road speed limit. Dale Earnhardt spun early due to contact from [[Ricky Rudd]], but he was able to make his way back to the front. [[Brett Bodine]] ran a very strong race and looked to be in contention for a second consecutive [[First Union 400]] until he was spun in Turn Three by [[Ricky Rudd]]. [[Geoff Bodine]] was black-flagged for making contact with [[Davey Allison]] after the two had spun in Turn Four. Allison had escaped without damage in the first incident, but contact from Bodine after the caution damaged his right front fender. [[Jimmy Spencer]] seemed to have the car to beat, at one point leading 70 laps. [[Darrell Waltrip]] ended the long day in Victory Lane, winning his first race as a driver/owner since his early days in the 1970s. It was his 80th career win. This race had the record for most cautions in a Cup race at North Wilkesboro Speedway, with 17 cautions.

[[Harry Gant]] was looking to make history in the 1991 Tyson Holly Farms 400. After winning four straight Cup wins at Darlington, Richmond, Dover, and Martinsville, a win at North Wilkesboro would be a modern-era record of five straight wins in the [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series.]] He had also won both Busch races that he had run in that period. Gant beat [[Davey Allison]] for the pole and also had a chance to earn the Unocal bonus, totaling $144,400, if he could win from the pole. Gant looked like he would get the record all day, staying out front and leading 350 laps until late in the race when he began experiencing brake problems. With nine laps to go, Dale Earnhardt passed Gant on the high side and went on to take the checkered flag. Gant still held on to a second-place finish, but his chance at making history was over.

In the 1992 First Union 400, [[Davey Allison]] beat [[Rusty Wallace]] and drove to victory with broken ribs. He had broken his ribs in a hard crash at Bristol the week before. [[Alan Kulwicki]] won the pole and led the most laps with 182. Davey Allison maintained his early [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]] season points lead.

The 1992 Tyson Holly Farms 400 was the last time a [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]] race went without a single caution flag on a track less than one mile in length. It was the last caution-free race until 1997 at Talladega. The race was run on a Monday after rain showers had postponed it on Sunday. [[Alan Kulwicki]] won the pole again, sweeping both poles at the track for the season. [[Geoffrey Bodine]] won the race that ended with only two drivers on the lead lap, Bodine and [[Terry Labonte]]. Bodine led 312 laps in the race driving the Number 15 [[Bud Moore (racing driver)|Bud Moore]] [[Ford]].

In the First Union 400 in 1994, [[Terry Labonte]] got his first [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]] win since 1989 and his first win driving for [[Rick Hendrick]] in the Number Five Kellogg Chevy. [[Ernie Irvan]] started from the pole with a track record speed of 119.016&amp;nbsp;mph and dominated most of the day, leading 320 laps in the 400-lap race before a pit stop miscue cost him the win. He was only able to make it back up to third position, and Labonte beat [[Rusty Wallace]] for the win.

The Tyson Holly Farms 400 that fall was a runaway for [[Geoffrey Bodine]], who is the last [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]] driver to win by lapping the entire field. [[Jimmy Spencer]] started on the pole and led the first five laps. Bodine started 18th and cut through the field and into the Top Ten by Lap Five. Bodine led 334 out of 400 laps. This was the last win for [[Hoosier's]] Tire in the [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]]; they withdrew from the series after NASCAR made new rules for the 1995 season with more requirements from tire companies.

Enoch Staley died of a stroke on May 22, 1995. Less than one month later, [[Speedway Motorsports, Inc.]] CEO [[Bruton Smith]] purchased fifty percent of the shares of the speedway from the Combs family. Smith had approached the Staley family prior to and after the death of Enoch in 1995. The family declined to sell to him because Enoch had distrusted Smith and had instructed the family never to sell the track to him. After this, it was decided that Smith and Mike Staley, Enoch's son, would have equal representation on the track. Mike Staley was installed as President and Chief Operating Officer of the Speedway for a one-year term.

The 1995 fall race weekend included the first NASCAR Supertrack race at the track and the return of [[Ernie Irvan]] to the Cup racing. Irvan had not raced since his near fatal crash at Michigan in 1994. He made his first start in a truck on Saturday, starting on the outside front row. He led 24 laps before suspension problems forced him to pull out of the race just after the halfway break. [[Kenny Wallace]], [[Jack Sprague]], and [[Geoff Bodine]] all ran strong up front at some point, but [[Mike Bliss]] went on to score his first-ever truck win. On Sunday in the Tyson Holly Farms 400, Irvan, driving a Number 88 [[Robert Yates Racing]] [[Ford]], started seventh and finished sixth with a 31-lap lead. [[Mark Martin]] picked up his second win at the track. This was the first [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]] race since 1959 with all the cars running at the finish. There were 28 lead changes in this race, a record for North Wilkesboro Cup races.

On January 1, 1996, the fifty-percent interest in North Wilkesboro Speedway owned by the Staley family was sold to racetrack developer and promoter Bob Bahre, owner of [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]]. Mike Staley said that selling the track was very painful, but it was the only choice he had. Both Bahre and [[Bruton Smith]] already owned several NASCAR circuits. They announced their intent to use the spring and fall race dates for their own tracks, citing North Wilkesboro Speedway's age and lack of modern amenities. They said, "cash rules everything around us."

In the 1996 First Union 400, [[Terry Labonte]] won the pole, led the most laps, and won the race while tying Richard Petty's Iron-man streak of 513 consecutive starts. He also collected a bonus of $129,200 from the Unocal 76 Challenge Award for the race by winning from the pole. His car was painted silver to commemorate his record streak. The race attracted over 60,000 race fans. Many of them thought this would be the last race held at the Speedway since Bahre had enough time to organize a race at his New Hampshire International Speedway.

The [[1996 Tyson Holly Farms 400]] was the last [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]] race held at the track. Junior Johnson refused to attend the last race weekend stating "I'm not going. It would be more of a sad deal for me to go out and just stand around and look at something disappear, something I can remember almost since I've been around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Last Lap NASCAR's Growing Pains Felt Acutely in Wilkes County, N.C., Where the Winston Cup Series is Saying Farewell to North Wilkesboro Speedway After Nearly a Half-Century|last=Zeller|first=Bob|publisher=''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]''|page=C1|date=September 28, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruton Smith]] needed extra security for the weekend for own protection. Most of the hostile race fans viewed him as the reason for the track's closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Added race security steps included warning to Smith|last=Hubbard|first=Jule|publisher=''The Journal-Patriot''|page=1|date=September 30, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ted Musgrave got the last pole with a lap speed of 118.054&amp;nbsp;mph. This was the last Cup race to have fewer than 40 cars start until the [[2016 Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500]] at Atlanta, where only 39 cars showed up. Eight drivers led laps in the race, with [[Jeff Gordon]] leading most of the event with 207 laps up front. Gordon won the race in front of a record crowd over runner-up Dale Earnhardt. Every car that started this race was running at the finish. Most of the fans remained in the stands long after the race was over, holding on to memories of the track.

The track was closed after the fall race of 1996. North Wilkesboro's spring date was moved to Smith's new [[Texas Motor Speedway]]. The fall date was taken over by Bahre's New Hampshire track and moved to early September as part of a schedule realignment. Since the sale to Bahre and Smith, there have been attempts to buy the track and reopen it. Some long-time fans still meet at the track on former race weekends to reminisce and renew old acquaintances.

===Junior Johnson's Purchase Attempt===

In early 2003, [[Junior Johnson]] and a group of investors considered purchasing the speedway. Johnson speculated that the track could be used for all levels of NASCAR minor-league racing series. A driving school and a test track for the Cup series were others proposed uses for the track. However, in 2004 due to disputes between the two owners, numerous repairs needed, and economic obstacles, Johnson deemed any track purchase highly unlikely.

===Community Petition===

In October 2003, local realtor Robert Glen started a petition to return racing to North Wilkesboro Speedway. Glen asserted that the speedway's absence was hurting the local economy. "People are losing their jobs, and they're losing their homes. You mention the speedway, and you see a glimmer of hope in their eyes. That racetrack is a crown jewel of Wilkes County . . . . this as a catalyst for bringing in new business and jobs to Wilkes." The petition asked county commissioners to condemn the Speedway and, through power of eminent domain, sell to an investor that would repurpose the facility for auto racing. There were 3,313 signatures on the petition. However, county officials decided condemnation of the property was not the best option.

===Race for the Ride===

During the fall of 2004, Roush Racing had its "Race for the Ride" testing session for its ''[[Roush Racing: Driver X]]'' television show. Twenty-six drivers, including [[Justin Allgaier]], [[Erik Darnell]], [[Matt McCall (racing driver)|Matt McCall]], [[Danny O'Quinn]], and [[David Ragan]], competed for a chance to earn a ride in the [[2005 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series]]. The Roush Racing team asserted that North Wilkesboro Speedway would be a great place for testing young talent because "it's a driver's track" and because none of the drivers had ever raced there, everyone would have an equal shot.

===Save the Speedway===

STS Motorsports, Inc., a group founded in 2005 by Rob Marsden, has been trying to bring racing back to North Wilkesboro Speedway. The group began a petition and caught the attention of current owners, Smith and Bahre. The track was valued by county tax assessors at $4.83 million. The owners eventually agreed to sell for $12 million. No sale was made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalnow.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WSJ%2FMGArticle%2FWSJ_BasicArticle&amp;c=MGArticle&amp;cid=1149192860436&amp;path=%21sports&amp;s=1037645509200 Winston-Salem Journal | Lighten Up: Smith says NASCAR has gotten carried away with polishing its marketing image] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Save the Speedway spent the fall and winter of 2005 attempting to find a buyer or buyers for the track as well as proving that there was still interest in racing at the facility. Over a dozen touring series had written letters of intent to hold events should the Speedway be reopened. Three driving schools and several NASCAR teams showed interest in using the facility for testing.

In 2006 Save The Speedway worked with a New York real estate developer in an attempt to rally investors, but parted ways when neither party could come to an agreement.&lt;ref name="jayski.com"&gt;[http://www.jayski.com/pages/tracks/misc.htm#NW Jayski's Silly Season Site - MISC Track News/Rumors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225000/http://www.jayski.com/pages/tracks/misc.htm#NW |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, the group had not yet found investors to purchase the track.

===Speedway for Public Sales===
In January 2007 during the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Media Tour, Bruton Smith announced that he and co-owner Bob Bahre had agreed to let a real estate company attempt to sell the track for the asking price of $12 million.&lt;ref name="jayski.com"/&gt; On September 28, 2007, Worth Mitchell, a land developer, announced plans to purchase the speedway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Culver|first=Tommy|title=North Wilkesboro Speedway: New life on horizon?|url=http://www.goblueridge.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1532&amp;Itemid=1|website=GoBlueRidge.net|publisher=High County ADventures|accessdate=September 28, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901140058/http://www.goblueridge.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1532&amp;Itemid=1|archivedate=September 1, 2009|date=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Worth Mitchell estimated his odds at 50–50 of completing the deal, and since that time there has been no further information. Speedway Motorsports officials had no comment on the negotiations.&lt;ref name="jayski.com"/&gt;

On November 8, 2007, Bahre sold his share of North Wilkesboro Speedway to Smith as part of Smith's deal to buy Bahre's New Hampshire Motor Speedway.

===Highway Historical Marker===

Save the Speedway applied for a highway history marker. It was approved at the May meeting of the NC Highway Historical Marker Advisory Committee. North Carolina Office of Archives and History dedicated the placement of the marker on May 24, 2008 at 2:00&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethespeedway.net Save North Wilkesboro Speedway!]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511143521/http://www.savethespeedway.net/ |date=May 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaque reads:

NORTH WILKESBORO SPEEDWAY

Pioneer NASCAR dirt track. Built 1946; paved in 1958. Hosted sanctioned events, 1949-96. 5/8 mile oval {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}}. W.

===Return of Racing===

On October 31, 2009, Jayski.com announced that the USAR ProCup Series would host an event at North Wilkesboro Speedway on October 3, 2010. Also in 2010, the track hosted the ASA Late Model Series for the King's Ransom 300 and the PASS Late Models. In 2009 it was announced that Save The Speedway would partner with Speedway Associates to work on the speedway during their lease. On January 7, 2010, the track announced that there would be a PASS Super Late Models race April 7–9, 2011, which would be a 300-lap race for $153,000 in winnings. They also announced that the Buck Baker Driving School would be the official driving school of NWS. The track announced sponsorship from [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]].

===Labor Day Classic 200===

At the Labor Day Classic 200 on September 4, 2010 [[Chase Elliott]], son of [[Bill Elliott]], won his second PASS victory of his career. This was the first race at the track since 1996. Chase led twice for a total of 69 laps in the 200-lap green flag event. Donnie and Bobby Allison returned to the track as Grand Marshalls for the event, which also held races for Stadium Stock, Limited Late Models, and Allison Legacy.

===Brushy Mountain 250===

The Brushy Mountain 250 was the 12th USAR Pro Cup event of the 2010 season. The race was ran on October 3, 2010. Jeff Agnew won the pole with a 110.996&amp;nbsp;mph lap. 20 cars started the event that was the first major race held at North Wilkesboro since the track was dropped from the Cup schedule after 1996. Jeff Agnew led 104 of the 250 laps and won the race over runner up Clay Rogers by 0.775 of a second. A modified race was also ran at the event with Jason Myers winning.

===King's Ransom 300===

The ASA Late Model Series ran the King's Ransom 300 on October 31, 2010. [[Jeff Choquette]] won the pole, but Kyle Beattie started on the pole for the 150-lap Kings Ransom event after a full-field inversion to start the race. Brian Ortiz beat Beattie to the lead and led the first 11 laps until Brent Downey caught and passed him on Lap 12. Choquette had flown through the field and eventually passed Downey for the lead on Lap 20. Choquette held the lead until the halfway break. Drivers came down Pit Road for a ten-minute break to make adjustments and get new tires for the second half of the race. The lineup for the second segment of the race had the top six cars inverted, putting Ortiz as the leader for the start of the second half. Ortiz led until Lap 107, when Choquette ran back up through the field and took the lead.  Choquette led the rest of the way to the victory, as Sean Bass and Tanner Berryhill came in second and third respectively. This was Choquette's third win in the last four Sunoco National Tour races. In the other races, Becca Kasten was black-flagged for jumping the final restart, giving the win to Matt McCall in the 150-lap Late Model Stock race. Justin Sorrow held off Gary Davis in a thrilling photo finish to win the 100-lap Limited Late Model race, and Wayne Harrington won the UCAR 40-lap race. The Short Track Shootout was held the day before with [[Cale Gale]] winning the Rolling Thunder Modifieds Series race. Alan Carter won the USST Super Trucks Series race, and Tyler Hill won the Allison Legacy Series race.

==="The Race"===

The 2011 season-opener, the Pro All Stars Series (PASS) South, presented by J. E. Pistons and Roush Yates Performance Products, "The Race" was the country's richest short-track race ever. Seventy-seven drivers showed up to try to make the 44-car field and try to win the $75,000 winner's purse. It was the first-ever race held under the lights at the track, but severe storms forced postponement of the race, which resulted in the race not ending under the lights.

Qualifying, heat races, and a couple of last chance events were used to set the 44-car field. Drivers from 21 states and five Canadian provinces had showed up to try to make the field. On Friday, Stephen Nasse won the fast time with a new track record of 18.700 seconds. The fastest 15 during qualifying locked themselves into the field. The top ten drivers then had to redraw for their starting positions in the race. Five 25-lap heat races were run that evening, with the top three drivers in each race transferring into the race. On Saturday, two 40-lap last chance races were run, with only the winners transferring into the race. Ten provisionals were given from the PASS series, and Geoff Bodine and Sterling Marlin were added to the field as North Wilkesboro Speedway track provisionals.

Before "The Race," a 100-lap modified race was run. Jimmy Zacharias dominated the first half of the event. Zacharias had a half-lap lead over the field by the first yellow flag on Lap 16. Jason Myers moved up and challenged Zacharias hard for the lead before the competition caution flew at halfway. After the teams made adjustments during the break, Zacharias and Jason Myers led the field to the green, when Zacharias again took off with the lead. On Lap 75, the yellow flag flew again, and all the leaders pitted to make final adjustments and set up for a 25-lap dash to the finish. Randy Butner and Gary Putnam led the field on the restart with Zacharias in the back after his pit stop. Junior Miller would soon take over the lead as Zacharias' car appeared to be losing grip after running hard to charge back up to the front. After a yellow on Lap 90, Zacharias and Jason Myers pitted for more adjustments. Miller took the restart and never looked back, taking the 100-lap Modified victory.

The main race started with Johnny Clark and Jay Fogleman on the front row. Clark was able get out front and lead the first lap of the race. Andy Loden, Augie Grill, Bubba Pollard, and Jody Lavender led in the first segment of the race. An eight-minute break was given for teams to work on their cars and change four tires to prep them for the second segment. Pollard took the lead on the restart and continued to lead until just prior to the Lap 200 end-of-segment break, when [[Chris Eggleston]] worked his way to the lead. At the break, team once again put four new tires on and made adjustments for the last segment. Pollard jumped to the lead quickly at the start the last segment. With 50 laps remaining, Pollard and Eggleston ran hard-nose to tail through lapped traffic. On Lap 276, Pollard appeared to try to get under Clark off Turn Four and got sideways, allowing Eggleston to drive around on the high side and take the lead. Over the final laps of the caution-free segment, Eggleston was able to pull away from Pollard. At the end of 300 laps of racing, Eggleston took the checkered flag to win the historic event. Pollard had finished runner-up but was disqualified after post race technical inspection. [[Jeff Choquette]] was bumped up to second place, with T.J. Reaid, Ben Rowe, and Andy Loden filling out the top five. Other notable drivers in the field were [[Ryan Blaney]] (sixth), [[Ross Kenseth]] (seventh), [[Cale Gale]] (12th), [[Erik Darnell]] (18th), [[Geoff Bodine]] (36th), [[Kenzie Ruston]] (37th), [[Gray Gaulding]] (39th), and [[Sterling Marlin]] (43rd). However, after the April 2011 race at the Speedway, Save The Speedway said it would cease working with Speedway Associates and would no longer assist with the Speedway.

'''Performance Driving''' is categorized as a driver of an automobile utilizing specific techniques to maximize the performance potential (See also [[vehicle dynamics]]) of the automobile during acceleration, turning, and braking maneuvers, typically while driving at a facility dedicated——and specifically constructed——to host automobile [[motorsport]] competitive events.

''"Performance Driving"'' may also be called ''"Car Control"'', and the skills can be learned in a variety of ways:
*Books describing the techniques&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0760305188&lt;/ref&gt;
*Videos/ DVDs demonstrating the techniques&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SAPJGM&lt;/ref&gt;
*Attending a school organized specifically to teach the techniques

Methods utilized:
*Separation of Controls
**Brake
**Throttle
**Steering
*Vision/ Use of Eyes
*Visualization
*Anticipation
*Muscle Memory
*Practice techniques

The [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] for this technique is the performance characteristics of the modern automotive [[tire]]. The tires on your car have a specific maximum amount of grip (one component of 'grip' being [[friction]]). The tire is also load sensitive——that is the maximum grip developed at any instant in time is dependent upon the force applied at the tire to [[Asphalt concrete|tarmac]] interface. The driver has great influence upon the load on a given tire and also the rate at which that load is applied to the tire.

It was described by [[NFL Films]] as "a play that the Eagles had never called before, run on 4th down by an undrafted rookie running back pitching the football to a third-string [[tight end]] who had never attempted an NFL pass before, throwing to a backup quarterback who had never caught an NFL (or college) pass before, [pulled off] on the biggest stage for football."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_RHOB9xkqo&amp;t=6m43s Super Bowl LII Like You Have Never Seen it Before] (NFL Films, posted to YouTube on Feb 12, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye6dVwDb_u0&amp;t=15m40s The "Philly Special" Stuns Belichick, Super Bowl LII] (NFL Turning Point, NFL Films, posted to YouTube on Feb 7, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
A play identical to the Philly Special had been successfully run at the college level on a two-point conversion attempt in 2012 by [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]] with [[Andre Ellington]], [[DeAndre Hopkins]] and [[Tajh Boyd]] all involved against Georgia Tech.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqJqaqFiwds Hopkins to Boyd 2-pt Conversion] (2012 Clemson vs Ga Tech, posted to YouTube on Mar 18, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, the play was run in the NFL by the [[Chicago Bears]] against the [[Minnesota Vikings]], at [[U.S. Bank Stadium]], the same stadium in which the Philly Special also took place.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye6dVwDb_u0&amp;t=15m5s The "Philly Special" Stuns Belichick (Super Bowl LII) | Eagles vs. Patriots | NFL Turning Point] (NFL Films, posted to YouTube on Feb 7, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;  Like Clemson, the Bears' attempt, led by [[Matt Barkley]], [[Jeremy Langford (American football)|Jeremy Langford]] and [[Cameron Meredith]], was a success as they scored a touchdown on the play.  Eagles receiver [[Alshon Jeffery]], who was a member of the Bears at the time, stated his team's wide receivers coach [[Mike Groh]], a former Bears coach in the same position, introduced the play to Doug Pederson.  Eagles offensive coordinator [[Frank Reich]] considered using it against the Vikings in the NFC Championship Game before Super Bowl LII, but relented due to the lopsided score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Emma|first=Chris|url=https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/02/05/philly-special-eagles-wild-trick-touchdown-was-borrowed-from-bears/|title=Philly Special, Eagles’ Wild Trick Touchdown, Was Borrowed From Bears|publisher=[[WBBM-TV]]|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Patriots also pulled off a version of the Philly Special against the Eagles in 2015.  [[Tom Brady]] wandered out of the pocket and the ball was snapped to [[James White (running back)|James White]]. White then pitched the ball to [[Danny Amendola]] who connected with Brady for a 36-yard pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Toole|first=Connor|url=https://brobible.com/sports/article/patriots-philly-special-against-eagles-2015/|title=The Patriots Pulled Off Their Own Version Of ‘The Philly Special’ Against The Eagles In 2015|publisher=[[BroBible]]|date=February 2018|accessdate=September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nick Foles had played as a tight end in high school during his sophomore year.  After the Super Bowl, he stated that the last time he had caught a pass for a touchdown was when he was in high school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X5fG1A4kuc&amp;t=9 NFL Primetime post-game interview with Nick Foles] (ESPN, Feb 4, 2018, on YouTube)&lt;/ref&gt;  Trey Burton, at his high school, had been a first team all-state quarterback during [[Trey_Burton#Early_years|his junior and senior years]].  During [[Trey_Burton#College_career|his freshman year]] at the [[University of Florida]], he scored six touchdowns in a single game, breaking the team record set by  [[Tim Tebow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=302680057|title=Kentucky vs. Florida - Game Recap - September 25, 2010 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foles' experience as quarterback and tight end was at [[Westlake High School (Texas)|Westlake High]] near Austin, Texas.  [[Sam Ehlinger]], who would go on to start as quarterback at the University of Texas, also played at Westlake and ran this same play during his junior year on November 28, 2015.  Soon after the Super Bowl finished, Ehlinger tweeted a video of his high school touchdown catch, saying "It's a Westlake thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/sehlinger3/status/960320042905808896/video/1|title=Sam Ehlinger on Twitter|website=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/02/nfl-super-bowl-lii-patriots-eagles-trick-play-nick-foles-westlake-high-school Nick Foles' high school ran the same trick play the Eagles used in Super Bowl LII] (USA Today Sports, by Steven Ruiz, February 4, 2018 8:35 pm)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Super Bowl LII game action prior to the play==
During the second quarter, the Patriots had attempted a trick play with quarterback [[Tom Brady]] running a pattern as a receiver.  The ball was thrown on target by [[Danny Amendola]], but it slipped through Brady's hands.  The drive ended after the next play with the Eagles taking possession.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/watch-patriots-run-perfect-trick-play-in-super-bowl-but-tom-brady-gets-gator-arms/ Patriots run perfect trick play in Super Bowl but Tom Brady gets gator arms] (CBS Sports, by Will Brinson @WillBrinson, Feb 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

During Philadelphia's drive previous to their attempt at a trick play at the end of the second quarter, Nick Foles' pass was intercepted by Patriots defensive back [[Duron Harmon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bird|first=Hayden|title=The Patriots followed Duron Harmon’s goal-line interception with a 90-yard touchdown drive|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2018/02/04/the-patriots-followed-duron-harmons-goal-line-interception-with-a-90-yard-touchdown-drive|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=February 4, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Patriots, led by Tom Brady, drove down the field and scored on a [[James White (running back)|James White]] 26 yard touchdown run to cut the Eagles lead to 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buchmasser|first=Bernd|title=Super Bowl 52 Patriots vs Eagles: James White scores New England's first touchdown of the day|url=https://www.patspulpit.com/2018/2/4/16972102/super-bowl-52-new-england-patriots-philadelphia-eagles-james-white-touchdown|website=[[SB Nation|Pats Pulpit]]|date=February 4, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Florjancic|first=Matthew|title=WATCH: James White caps 90-yard drive with touchdown run for New England Patriots|url=http://www.wkyc.com/article/sports/nfl/watch-james-white-caps-90-yard-drive-with-touchdown-run-for-new-england-patriots/95-514521279|publisher=[[WKYC|WKYC-TV]]|location=Cleveland|date=February 4, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a [[Kenjon Barner]] kick return to the 30 yard line and two plays for 7 yards, the Eagles were faced with 3rd and 3. Nick Foles was able to find Corey Clement on a wheel route for 55 yards, which set up first-and-goal, but the Eagles' drive stalled, which brought up fourth-and-goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Raphielle|title=Corey Clement 55-Yard Catch Puts Eagles In Red Zone|url=https://www.fanragsports.com/now/corey-clement-55-yard-catch-puts-eagles-in-red-zone/|website=FanRagSports.com|date=February 4, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The play==
[[File:Philly Special Diagram.png|thumb|300px|Shows the play's diagram|Diagram of the Philly Special]]

Foles lined up in the shotgun formation, but moved up to the right side of the offensive line behind right tackle [[Lane Johnson]] and yelled "kill, kill", followed by "Lane, Lane." Foles then stayed on the right side of the offensive line and the ball was snapped to running back Corey Clement. Clement then ran left and flipped the ball to Trey Burton, to complete a reverse to the right side of the field. Finally, Burton threw the ball to Foles, who ran a route to the right corner of the end zone and made the catch for a Philadelphia touchdown. After the extra-point was successfully kicked by [[Jake Elliott]], the Eagles went up 22–12, maintaining the score into halftime.

All three players who touched the ball on this play began the season as backups. Corey Clement was a third-string running back, Trey Burton was a third string tight-end and Nick Foles began the season as the backup quarterback to [[Carson Wentz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belson|first1=Ken|last2=Longman|first2=Jeré|title=How Nick Foles and the Eagles Tricked the Patriots|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/sports/foles-super-bowl.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beaton|first1=Andrew|last2=Cohen|first2=Ben|title=The Trick Play the Philadelphia Eagles Borrowed to Win the Super Bowl|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-trick-play-the-philadelphia-eagles-borrowed-to-win-the-super-bowl-1517854628|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=EJ|title=Video: Eagles' Super Bowl trick play ends with Nick Foles catching a touchdown|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/video-eagles-super-bowl-trick-play-ends-with-nick-foles-catching-a-touchdown-20180204.html|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=February 4, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many designs of this play following the Super Bowl have TE [[Zach Ertz]] blocking in a different location.

==Broadcasting calls==
Before the play was called, NBC broadcaster [[Cris Collinsworth]] expressed his shock on-air that the Eagles would go for it, as he said, "This is an unbelievable call...This is like going for an onside kick. This could decide the game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pergament|first=Alan|title=Michaels, Collinsworth have strong, perplexing moments on Super Bowl call|url=http://buffalonews.com/2018/02/04/michaels-collinsworth-have-strong-moments-on-super-bowl-call-as-well-as-perplexing-ones/|newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=February 4, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===

==Controversy==
Following the play, Patriots fans questioned if it was legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetylt.com/sports/super-bowl-lii-philly-speciall-illegal|title=Was the 'Philly Special' a legal play?}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NFL Rulebook, the "offensive team must have at least seven players on line" and defines that a non-snapper player is on the line if the player's helmet "break[s] a vertical plane that passes through the beltline of the snapper."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180313103104/https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2017-nfl-rulebook/&lt;/ref&gt; However, when looking back at the play, they argued that Eagles' wide-receiver [[Alshon Jeffery]] wasn't on the line of scrimmage, but rather slightly off it. Therefore, they argued, the Eagles had only six players on the line of scrimmage instead of the required seven. [[Fox NFL|Fox Sports]] rules expert and former NFL referee [[Mike Pereira]] even said "...They lined up wrong...Not only that, [but] it’s a trick play. And if you’re going to run a trick-type play, then you have to be lined up properly...It’s kind of one of those [penalties] that has no effect on the play. I get it. But they didn’t line up properly. And it really should’ve been called."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallen|first=Daniel|title=Rules analyst says Philadelphia Eagles' signature 'Philly Special' in Super Bowl was illegal formation|url=http://www.pennlive.com/philadelphiaeagles/index.ssf/2018/02/rules_analyst_says_philadelphi.html|newspaper=[[The Patriot-News]]|date=February 13, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rapaport|first=Daniel|title=Mike Pereira: Eagles lined up illegally on 'Philly Special'|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/02/12/eagles-super-bowl-trick-play-philly-special|magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=February 12, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, before the snap, Jeffery pointed to the down judge several times, asking if he was lined up correctly and got a head nod in return each time, indicating he was properly aligned.&lt;ref name="Kirshner"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirshner|first=Alex|title=No, that Foles TD catch wasn’t from an illegal formation|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2018/2/4/16972192/nick-foles-touchdown-illegal-formation|website=SB Nation|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This practice is typical at all levels of the sport for confirming proper alignment before a play.&lt;ref name="Kirshner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Zeigler, Syd |date=15 November 2016 |title=NFL illegal formation violations are increasing, and the league is cracking down |work=SB Nation |url=https://www.sbnation.com/2016/11/15/13541854/illegal-formation-referees-nfl-college |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Eagles went on to win Super Bowl LII, 41–33. It was the team's first NFL championship since [[1960 NFL Championship Game|1960]], and first ever Super Bowl win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Peter|title=The Philly Special: Inside the ‘Set of Stones’ Play Call That Helped the Eagles Win the Super Bowl|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/02/05/super-bowl-52-eagles-patriots-peter-king-mmqb|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the game, coach Doug Pederson told reporters "We call [the play] the Philly special..." Pederson also noted that the play came from “...[looking] at different plays around the league and the collegiate ranks, and things that over the years that might fit what we do. We found this one that fit, and we’ve been working on it for the last couple of weeks and tonight was the night.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=|date=February 4, 2018|title=Doug Pederson Post Game Press Conference, "We call it the Philly special..."|medium=YouTube|language=English|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQXWbbT5SJs|access-date=March 6, 2018|publisher=Sports Complex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after the game, Showtime's ''[[Inside the NFL]]'' released footage with audio between Coach Doug Pederson and Nick Foles. It showed Nick Foles suggesting the Philly Special, saying "You want Philly Philly?", and Pederson responding, after a thoughtful pause, by saying “Yeah, let’s do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knoblauch|first=Austin|title=Nick Foles ordered up 'Philly Special' trick TD play call|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000915082/article/nick-foles-ordered-up-philly-special-trick-td-play-call|publisher=National Football League|date=February 7, 2018|accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Philly, Philly’: ‘Inside The NFL’ Footage Reveals Nick Foles Made Trick Play Call In Super Bowl|url=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2018/02/06/nick-foles-trick-play-super-bowl-2018/|publisher=[[KYW-TV]]|date=February 6, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, ESPN's [[Darren Rovell]] announced that the Philadelphia Eagles had filed for a trademark for the term "Philly Special." If the team wins the rights, they would most likely use the term for apparel and other paraphernalia. Seven other groups, including [[Yuengling]], also filed for the trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chiari|first=Mike|title=Eagles File to Trademark 'Philly Special" After Super Bowl 52 Win over Patriots|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2760497-eagles-file-to-trademark-philly-special-after-super-bowl-52-win-over-patriots|publisher=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=February 20, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuengling later retracted their file for the trademark.

At the NFL Owners Meetings in Orlando, Doug Pederson said that the play is being unofficially retired for at least the next season due to other teams' awareness of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kerr|first=Jeff|title=Doug Pederson unofficially retires 'Philly Special'|url=https://247sports.com/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/Bolt/Doug-Pederson-unofficially-retires-Philly-Special--116740051|publisher=247 Sports|date=March 27, 2018|accessdate=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2018, the Eagles received their Super Bowl rings. The bezel of the ring contained 127 diamonds, which is the total from the numbers of the jerseys of the three players who handled the ball after the snap on the Philly Special—Corey Clement (30), Trey Burton (88) and Nick Foles (9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=West|first=Jenna|title=The Eagles' Super Bowl Rings Pay Tribute to 'Philly Special' and Dog Masks|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/06/14/eagles-super-bowl-rings-philly-special-dog-masks|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=June 14, 2018|accessdate=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7OL5gjG_hY&amp;t=65 The Making of the Super Bowl LII Championship Ring] (Philadelphia Eagles, posted to YouTube on Jun 15, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, a statue commemorating the Philly Special, showing the moment of discussion between Nick Foles and Doug Pederson, was unveiled at Lincoln Financial Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Campitelli|first= Enrico|title=Bud Light unveils 'Philly Special' statue of Doug Pederson and Nick Foles |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/the700level/bud-light-unveils-philly-special-statue-doug-pederson-and-nick-foles|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=September 5, 2018|accessdate=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2018, during the first game of the [[2018 NFL season|2018 season]], the Eagles ran a similar trick play against the [[Atlanta Falcons]] successfully, gaining a first down. Despite the Philly Special being occasionally called "Philly Philly" due to the conversation Foles and Pederson had regarding calling that play, Pederson indicated the play in the Falcons-Eagles game is called "Philly Philly." It is notable that in Super Bowl LII, the Patriots ran a play that was essentially identical, albeit not successful, to the Philly Philly play the Eagles ran against the Falcons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the Eagles stole 'Philly Philly' from the Patriots|url=https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/video/how-eagles-stole-philly-philly-patriots|publisher=NBC Sports|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2018, the [[2018 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] ran the play successfully for a two-point conversion against the [[2018 New York Jets season|New York Jets]].  RB [[Duke Johnson]] took the snap and handed the ball off to WR [[Jarvis Landry]], who threw a pass to QB [[Baker Mayfield]].  As Landry is left-handed, the play was run to the left side of the field, rather than the right side.  This play has earned nicknames "Baker Special"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Browns tie game on Hyde TD, Baker special |publisher=92.3 the Fan |url=https://923thefan.radio.com/articles/cleveland-browns-tie-game-carlos-hyde-td-baker-mayfield-special |date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Mayfield, "Cleveland Special,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Watch: Browns Run 'Cleveland Special' With Baker Mayfield, Jarvis Landr |publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]] |url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/09/20/baker-mayfield-browns-jets-cleveland-special-jarvis-landry |date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the "Dilly Special"&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/billbarnwell/status/1042968876693118978 The Dilly Special]&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to [[Bud Light]]'s "Dilly Dilly" ad campaign.

'''Punt Road Oval''', also known by naming rights sponsorship as the '''[[Swinburne University|Swinburne]] Centre''', is an Australian rules football ground and former cricket oval located in [[Yarra Park, Melbourne|Yarra Park]], [[East Melbourne, Victoria]] situated only a few hundred metres to the east of the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG).

Punt Road Oval was a former venue for the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (now Australian Football League) with 544 VFL/AFL premiership matches played there between 1908 and 1964 and as the headquarters and former home ground of the [[Richmond Football Club]].

==History==
In October 1855 an application was made for the [[Monash Tigers|Richmond Cricket Club]] to play matches on the [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] paddock next to the site occupied by the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]].  The first documented [[cricket]] match on the oval was played on 27 December 1856.

It was used as the home ground by the [[Richmond Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football Association]]  (VFA) from 1885 to 1907 then in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL) from 1908 to 1964.  It was also used by the [[Melbourne Football Club]] during and immediately after [[World War II]], when the MCG became a military base. Not until late 1946 were Melbourne able to play the MCG again. In [[1956 VFL season#Round 4|round 4 of the 1956 season]], Melbourne played a one off home game at Punt Road against Fitzroy, this time due to renovations at the MCG in preparation for the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]. Owing to the arrangement of the draw for 1942, [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]] played one home game there against [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] when Richmond had the bye.

After the 1964 season, the capacity of the venue was to be reduced to only 22,000, after much of the outer was to be lost to the widening by 50&amp;nbsp;ft of [[Punt Road]], a notorious traffic bottleneck. Under the stewardship of President [[Ray Dunn]], Richmond negotiated to move its home games to the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] starting from 1965. The last senior [[VFL/AFL|VFL]] game was played at the venue on 22 August 1964, between [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] and [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]], where Richmond was beaten by 31 points. The club retained the venue as its training and administrative base, despite moving its home games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=4 November 1964|title=New den for the Tigers|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1999 it hosted a [[Australian domestic limited-overs cricket tournament|Mercantile Mutual Cup]] match between Victoria and Canberra.

==Ground records - VFL==
*Most Goals (Individual) in a Match: 14 by [[Doug Strang]] (Richmond vs {{AFL Nor}}, Round 2 1931)
*Highest Score: 219 (Richmond 33.21 (219) def. North Ballarat 4.7 (31), Round 1 2017)
*Lowest Score: 16 (Richmond 8.6 (54) def. {{AFL StK}} 1.10 (16), Round 15 1910)
*Greatest Winning Margin: 188 points (Richmond 33.21 (219) def. North Ballarat 4.7 (31), Round 1 2017)
*Drawn Matches: 6
*Record attendance: 46,000 (Richmond vs {{AFL Car}}, Round 9 1949)

==Today==
The ground is still used for training by the [[Richmond Football Club]] and it remains the club's administrative headquarters. A statue of Tigers legend [[Jack Dyer]] is outside the ground. A $20 million redevelopment was completed in 2011. The redeveloped sports facilities at Punt Road Oval  accommodate a range of business and community sports organisations, including Klim Swim, the [[VRI Fencing Club]] and the Indigenous Youth Education Centre known as the Korin Gamaji Institute.

The venue remained the home ground for the [[Monash Tigers|Richmond Cricket Club]] from 1856 to the end of the 2010/11 season; in 2011/12, the club moved to [[Central Reserve]], [[Glen Waverley, Victoria|Glen Waverley]].

The naming rights for the ground were then sold to ME Bank. In 2017 it was commercially re-branded as the [[Swinburne University|Swinburne]] Centre at Punt Road Oval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warner|first1=Michael|title=Punt Rd Oval to be renamed Swinburne Centre as Richmond joins forces with uni|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/teams/richmond/punt-rd-oval-to-be-renamed-swinburne-centre-as-richmond-joins-forces-with-uni/news-story/ac638133fdabaa053d49da68aa76fc45?nk=b6fb24ffb8b8fd2acacae06bc9e80b29-1508750573|accessdate=23 October 2017|work=Herald Sun|publisher=News Corp Australia|date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since being re-established in 2014, the [[Richmond Football Club#Reserves team|Richmond reserves]] team has played its [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] home games at the venue.

When Richmond defeated [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]] in the [[2017 AFL Grand Final|2017 Grand Final]] to win their first flag in 37 years, the venue hosted an official Richmond viewing party that attracted 15,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByE4jIB6UlA ''Seven News Melbourne'' – September 30, 2017] YouTube (originally broadcast by Seven Network)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rugby shorts''' are a type of shorts that are worn while playing [[rugby football|rugby]]. They are designed to take the strains of the game and have traditionally been made from [[cotton]]. 

==IRB Regulations on shorts==
Law 4 of the [[International Rugby Board]] (IRB) Laws of the Game of Rugby Union 2010 relates to the clothing that a player may wear while playing [[rugby union]].  In particular: 

*Law 4.4 (c) states that: 
''"A player must not wear any items containing buckles, clips, rings, hinges, zippers, screws, bolts or rigid material or projection."'' 
* Law 4.4 (f) states that:
''"A player must not wear shorts with padding sewn into them".'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/law_4_en.pdf|title=Laws Of The Game, Law 4 Players’ Clothing|publisher=''[[International Rugby Board]]''|accessdate=2010-05-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5o4Xvoly8?url=http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/law_4_en.pdf|archivedate=2010-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fit==
Shorts should be comfortable, as tight shorts increase the chances of sustaining a serious injury. The longer and baggier shorts are, the easier it will be for opponents to pull an opponent back.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/rules_and_equipment/4204760.stm|title=Rugby union equipment: shorts|publisher=''BBC Sport''|accessdate=2010-05-27 | date=2005-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colour and style of shorts are determined by the players club.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book |title= Rugby for Dummies |last1=Guthrie |first1=Patrick |last2=Brown|first2=Mathew|last3=Growden|first3=Greg|year=2007 |publisher= John Wiley &amp; sons Canada Ltd.|isbn=9780470153277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eO0O5zdavOkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Rugby+for+Dummies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UqzopUvfVY&amp;sig=lLVFfHTtBCUzz5eFnCEt_ahWA3g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6xcBTMP-OMmF4QatutDLDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Rugby shorts must be able to withstand punishment and should be thick enough to provide some protection while playing. Most have pockets and many have a drawstring to prevent them coming down when tackled.&lt;ref name=book /&gt; While the most popular material has been cotton, modern shorts can also be made from higher grade [[polyester]] with reinforced seams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyrugby.com/news/story_9609205122.php|title=Rugby Player’s Guide|publisher=rugbyrugby.com|accessdate=2010-05-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723051219/http://www.rugbyrugby.com/news/story_9609205122.php|archivedate=2010-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these shorts is increasing as they are lighter, more durable, more comfortable, and better retain their color compared to traditional cotton shorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.rugbyrugby.com/Rugby%20Sections/Equipment%20Review/Performance%20Shorts.asp|title=Performance Rugby Shorts|publisher=rugbyrugby.com|accessdate=2010-05-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403225748/http://guide.rugbyrugby.com/Rugby%20Sections/Equipment%20Review/Performance%20Shorts.asp|archivedate=2010-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations===

*[[Tag rugby]] shorts are generally lighter due to the non-contact nature of the sport and have tags attached with [[velcro]] patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishrugby.ie/tagrugby/15242_about.php|title=Budlight Tag|publisher=irishrugby.ie|accessdate=2010-05-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727043516/http://www.irishrugby.ie/tagrugby/15242_about.php|archivedate=2010-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underwear==
The use of hard plastic padding of any kind, including [[jock straps]], is forbidden in most leagues.  However, in the United States, the high-padding of [[American football]] has influenced some junior leagues to allow, or in some cases require, jock straps.

==Manufacturers of rugby shorts==
[[Canterbury of New Zealand]] is the most popular producer of rugby kit.  [[Kooga]] are a very popular supplier, particularly to [[rugby league]] teams.
Paladin Sports is also a very popular manufacturer for both Union &amp; League, as is Triple Play from Australia.

The '''South Africa Baseball Union''' ''SABU'' is the national governing body of [[baseball]] in [[South Africa]]. Baseball is played in all provinces, but it not a major sport especially due to the popularity and relative success of the comparable sport of [[cricket]], in which South Africa is one of the leading countries playing the sport.
The Union is a member of the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]] (WBSC),&lt;ref name="SABU-Page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federations|url=http://www.wbsc.org/es/federations/africa/baseball/RSA/|website=wbsc.org|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Baseball Federation]] (IBAF). SABU is also an affiliate of the [[South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee]] (SASCOC), which, alongside [[Sport and Recreation South Africa]] (SRSA) supervises all organised sport in South Africa. 

SABU controls the [[South African national baseball team]], which has participated in several major events such as the [[Summer Olympics]], [[World Baseball Classic]], [[Baseball World Cup]] and the [[African Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South African Baseball Union|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/South_African_Baseball_Union|website=Baseball Reference|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most notable South African born baseball players include [[Gift Ngoepe]], [[Anthony Phillips ]] and [[Dylan Unsworth]]

==History==
Baseball in South Africa began in the [[Witwatersrand]]. Gold miners from the [[United States]] started playing the game in South Africa leading to the establishment of Giants Baseball Club from the Crown Mines baseball team. Transvaal Baseball Association was established in 1905 with one of the early clubs being the Wanderers Baseball Club.&lt;ref name="SABU-Page"/&gt;

[[Japan]]ese influence led to the beginning of the sport in [[Port Elizabeth]], after a Japanese ship named the Paris Maru, was marooned in [[Algoa Bay]] in 1934, leading to its sailors being stranded for 3 months waiting for the next ship. The sailors consequently organized a game with the locals, who worked for US companies, as well as US missionaries at the Westborne Oval ultimately leading to the establishment of the Eastern Province Baseball Association in 1934.&lt;ref name="SABU-Page"/&gt;

During World War II, baseball was not played officially, but continued after the war in 1945. One of the first matches involved a US team selected from two visiting US naval warships, [[USS California (BB-44)|USS California]] and [[USS Tennessee (BB-43)|USS Tennessee]], with the Americans wining 6-4.&lt;ref name="SABU-Page"/&gt;

The 1950s marked the golden era for baseball in South Africa, with popular support from both players and locally-based American-owned businesses e.g. [[General Motors]]. A US side embarked on a South African tour in 1956. Many popular South African international Springbok rugby players displayed strong support for local baseball.&lt;ref name="SABU-Page"/&gt;

In 1935, the South African Baseball Federation (now South African Baseball Union) was established with its provincial affiliates being; Border, Western Province, Eastern Province, Northern Transvaal and Transvaal. Arthur Berezowski led the Federation for 25 years - 1949 to 1974. 1950 witnessed the rise of Western Province Baseball and Softball Union, comprising 11 baseball and 23 softball teams.&lt;ref name="SABU-Page"/&gt;

'''Taylor Rooks''' (born May 22, 1992) is an American sports journalist and broadcaster. She currently appears on Bleacher Report and Turner Sports. Before joining the Turner networks, she was a host, reporter, and correspondent at SportsNet New York. Prior to the New York Market, she worked for the [[Big Ten Network]]. She appeared on BTN Live, BTN Football Pregame, and Women's Sports Report. She was a sideline reporter for CBS Sports Network for the 2016-2017 football season. Prior to SNY, CBS, and BTN, Rooks was a football and basketball recruiting reporter for scout.com. She has an on-air presence for major events, such as the Big Ten Football Championship.

==Early life and family==
Taylor attended [[Peachtree Ridge High School]] in Suwanee, Georgia, United States. She graduated in 2010 as a manatee.

Rooks decided to follow in her parent's footsteps by attending the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] where she majored in broadcast journalism.&lt;ref name="suntimes1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/uncategorized/7/71/215684/whats-up-with-thomas-rooks-his-run-lives-forever-in-illini-lore/ |title=WhatБ─≥s up with ... Thomas Rooks: His run lives forever in Illini lore &amp;#124; Chicago |publisher=Chicago.suntimes.com |date=2014-10-30 |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time at the University of Illinois, Rooks covered and broke national football/basketball recruiting stories while working with Scout.com. She appeared on CBS Sports Network reporting on the WBB Pre-NIT Championship at 19 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawkeyesports.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/111612aac.html |title=Hawkeyes Set to Host Preseason WNIT Championship - Hawkeye Sports Official Athletic Site |publisher=Hawkeyesports.com |date=2010-12-02 |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout college, she interned with the [[PGA Tour]], [[Comcast SportsNet Chicago]], and Fox Sports/Scout.com. She received numerous scholarships in her time in Champaign, and helped expand women's interest in broadcasting. Rooks modeled briefly, but turned her focus to sports journalism.

Rooks comes from a family of athletes. She is the daughter of Thomas Rooks, top rushing leader for the Illinois Fighting Illini; the niece of [[St. Louis Cardinals]] Hall of Famer, [[Lou Brock]]; and the niece of former Pittsburgh Steelers and New Orleans Saints NFL player, [[Marv Woodson]]. Rooks is not married and has no children.&lt;ref name="suntimes1"/&gt;

==Career==
From August 2012 to May 2014, Taylor worked with scout.com covering Illinois football and basketball. She made national news with her stories and perspective on the game - specifically in recruiting. Rooks broke multiple stories regarding [[Cliff Alexander]], [[Jalen Brunson]], Quentin Snider, Aaron Jordan, Charles Matthews, and [[Jayson Tatum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.thesportsbank.net/illinois-illini/taylor-rooks-illini-btn/ |title=Taylor Rooks, Fox Sports Illini expert hired by BTN |publisher=Thesportsbank.net |date=2014-08-14 |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 -two months out of college- Taylor Rooks became an on-air host, reporter, and correspondent for the Big Ten Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Ryan|title=Introducing BTN Live's Newest Member Taylor Rooks|url=http://btn.com/2014/11/14/introducing-btn-lives-newest-member-taylor-rooks/|website=btn.com|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She appeared nightly on the popular sports television show, BTN Live, alongside Dave Revsine, Mike Hall, and Rick Pizzo, and analysts such as Jim Jackson, [[Chuck Long]], and [[Glen Mason]]. One of her roles is to interact with fans and bring their social media topics onto the screen. Rooks regularly reports on Big Ten Games throughout the season, and travels frequently for television shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=[Look] Sideline Reporter Taylor Rooks Is Heating Up Social Right Now|url=https://www.bet.com/news/sports/2016/04/22/-look--sideline-reporter-taylor-rooks-is-heating-up-social-right.html|website=Bet.com|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She hosts the Women's Sports Report, alongside Lisa Byington, covering all women's sports in the Big Ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://btn.com/2014/11/14/introducing-btn-lives-newest-member-taylor-rooks/ |title=Introducing BTN Live’s Newest Member Taylor Rooks « Big Ten Network |publisher=Btn.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
An average professional [[ice hockey]] [[defenseman]] is relegated to the minor leagues because his play is not aggressive enough. In an effort to get back to the majors, he plays dirty and gets into fights on the ice, which gets him back to the major. His aggressive play results in the death of another player as a result of injuries sustained during a game, and results in his being charged with manslaughter. The player appears largely indifferent to the situation, appearing to view it as a normal part of playing top level ice hockey.

'''Torero Stadium''' is a 6,000-seat [[stadium]] in [[San Diego, California]]. It was built in 1961. It is home to the [[University of San Diego]] [[American football|football]] team, which plays in the NCAA Pioneer Football League, the [[University of San Diego]] [[soccer]] team, which plays in the NCAA West Coast Conference, the [[San Diego Legion]] team, which plays in the [[Major League Rugby]] league, and formerly the [[San Diego Breakers]], playing in the [[PRO Rugby]] competition.

==Facilities and renovations==
The South stands feature approximately 1,100 bleacher seats with backs and with press box facilities. The East and North stands are all bleacher seating — the North stands hold about 3,000 fans and the stands behind the East end hold approximately 1,900. The playing surface is "Bandera" Bermuda grass, with soccer dimensions measuring 118 yards x 72 yards, with football conforming to NCAA regulations.

The stadium underwent two phases of renovation to host the WUSA [[San Diego Spirit]]. Over $3.5 million was spent to enlarge the seating areas and add spectator comforts.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} 
In 2001, the installation of the upgraded lighting system took place, giving Torero illumination for night events. The final steps included the paving of the pedestrian walkway that curves around three-quarters of the stadium and the installation of a new sound system and a video board and scoreboard.

==Former tenants and events==

The main sponsor of the then-named Tour d'Indonesia from 2003 to 2006 was [[:id:Dji Sam Soe|Dji Sam Soe 234]], a cigarette brand produced by [[Philip Morris International]] also called Philip Morris Racing. In 2007 Tour d'Indonesia was cancelled due to lack of funding and failure to attract a sponsor. In 2008 the tour was held again sponsored by [[Telkom Indonesia|Speedy]] broadband access of [[Telkom Indonesia|Telkom]]. Until the 2010 edition Speedy remained as official sponsor of this bicycle race.

The race was not held between 2012 and 2017, before being revived in 2018 as the Tour de Indonesia, as a 2.1 category race compared to the 2.2 it was before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voinews.id/index.php/component/k2/item/351-tour-de-indonesia-with-the-highest-classification-held-after-7-years|title=Tour De Indonesia with the Highest Classification Held after 7 Years|first=Ani|last=Hasanah|work=[[Voice of Indonesia]]|publisher=[[Radio Republik Indonesia]]|date=25 January 2018|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yuexiushan Stadium''' ({{zh|c=越秀山体育场|s=|t=粵秀山體育場}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Guangzhou]], [[China]], named for its location at the foot of [[Yuexiu Hill]]. It is currently mostly used for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and also sometimes for athletics. It is located on 4 Yingyuan Road.

The stadium, which is owned by the Guangzhou Sports Bureau, opened before 1926，and refresh in 1950 with a capacity of 35,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fussballtempel.net/afc/listeafc.html www.fussballtempel.net]&lt;/ref&gt; However, following renovation and the installation of fixed seating in 2012, the capacity is now 18,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wildeastfootball.net/2013/11/guangzhou-rf-2013-season-review-work-in-progress/|title=Guangzhou R&amp;F 2013 Season Review: Work in progress : Wild East Football|website=wildeastfootball.net|access-date=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is best reached by taking [[Guangzhou Metro]] [[Line 2, Guangzhou Metro|Line 2]] to [[Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall Station (Guangzhou)|Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall Station]].

== History ==
[[File:1930越秀山體育場.jpg|thumb|left|Yut Sau Shan Public Stadium in early 1930s.]]
[[File:Yuexiushan Stadium.jpg|thumb|upright|Yuexiushan Stadium in 2009, preparing for [[2010 Asian Games]].]]
In the past [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] the place was occupted by the ammunition depot.When the [[Republic China|Republic]] era came, [[Chen Jiongming|Chen Chiung-ming]] had designed the place to be used for sports. As the playground opened before 1926, it had muddy ground and few facilities.

In 1950 the new government refresh the playground as both a sports stadium and arena for civic celebrations. As the home stadium of first the Guangzhou city side and later the Guangdong provincial side, Yuexiushan hosted a large number of friendly matches with international opposition in the late 1950s and early 1960s including against Algeria, Sweden and Soviet champions Spartak Moscow.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wildeastfootball.net/2016/09/yuexiushan-the-cradle-of-cantonese-football-part-one/|title=Yuexiushan: The cradle of Cantonese football, part one|date=2016-09-13|newspaper=Wild East Football|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These games would come to be known as 'foreign battles' and would see both Cuba and Albania play at Yuexiushan in the early 1970s and, after the end of Cultural Revolution, visiting sides included the West German Olympic Team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gzrffc.com.cn/index.php?m=Article&amp;a=show&amp;id=880|title=越秀山情结--65年回首英雄地，为什么这里是南粤足球的圣地？-越秀山情怀故事|last=品拓互联-www.dotodo.net|website=www.gzrffc.com.cn|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuexiushan was also the venue for Guangzhou's [[National Day of the Republic of China|National Day]] celebrations, although an event to mark the 40th anniversary of the Russian October Revolution ended in disaster when 33 people were killed in a crush.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Yuexiushan Stadium hosted the inaugural [[Guangdong–Hong Kong Cup|Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup]] match in early 1979, which Guangdong won 1-0.

By the late 1980s Yuexiushan was no longer the premier ground in Guangzhou with the opening of the new [[Tianhe Stadium|Tianhe stadium]]. However, Guangzhou continued to play their regular fixtures at Yuexiushan and finished second in the National Championship in 1992 and 1994, helped by an unbeaten record of 21 games at Yuexiushan.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wildeastfootball.net/2016/11/yuexiushan-the-cradle-of-cantonese-football-part-two/|title=Yuexiushan: The cradle of Cantonese football, part two|date=2016-11-08|newspaper=Wild East Football|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuexiushan has undergone multiple renovations since the late 1990s which have seen player facilities in the entrance tower at the city end of the ground improved and a roof, electronic scoreboard and fixed plastic seating installed for spectators. Fans sitting at the Yuexiu Park end of the ground are still exposed to the elements though.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Following their promotion to the [[Chinese Super League]] (CSL), original tenants Guangzhou Evergrande (the successors to the Guangzhou side founded in 1954 and the first Chinese sports club with 5 million followers on Weibo&lt;ref&gt;http://en.ytsports.cn/news-963.html&lt;/ref&gt;) moved out of the Yuexiushan Stadium and across town to Tianhe Stadium for the 2011 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gzevergrandefc.com/english/about.aspx?target=text&amp;ftid=297|title=Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao Club History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gzevergrandefc.com/|publisher=|access-date=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guangzhou R&amp;F played their first home game at Yuexiushan in the summer of 2011 and were promoted to the CSL at the end of the season. Following R&amp;F's third-place finish in 2014, Yuexiushan hosted four Asian Champions League games under floodlights in 2015.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Yuexiushan was renovated over the winter of 2016/17. The pitch was relayed, VIP facilities improved and the whole stadium painted blue (the colour of tenants Guangzhou R&amp;F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gzrffc.com.cn/index.php?m=Article&amp;a=show&amp;id=1909|title=富力TV {{!}} 越秀山回归倒计时，精彩揭秘抢先看-富力TV报道|last=品拓互联-www.dotodo.net|website=www.gzrffc.com.cn|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first match at the refurbished stadium was held on 28 April 2017 when R&amp;F were defeated 1-3 by Guizhou Hengfeng in the CSL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gzrffc.com.cn/index.php?m=Article&amp;a=show&amp;id=1911|title=遭遇赛季首败，回归越秀山我们重新出发-赛事新闻|last=品拓互联-www.dotodo.net|website=www.gzrffc.com.cn|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuexiushan was later repainted in gold and green after Guangzhou R&amp;F suffered a poor run of form. The decision was reportedly made on feng shui principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestadiumbusiness.com/2017/08/11/csl-team-superstitiously-paints-entire-stadium-gold-climbs-third-league/|title=CSL team superstitiously paints entire stadium gold, climbs to third in league - The Stadium Business|website=www.thestadiumbusiness.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
