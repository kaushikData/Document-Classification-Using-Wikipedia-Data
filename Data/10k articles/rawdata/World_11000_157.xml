The '''African Free Trade Zone (AFTZ)''' is a [[free trade zone]] announced at the EAC-SADC-COMESA Summit on 22 October 2008 by the heads of [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA) and the [[East African Community]] (EAC). The African Free Trade Zone is also referred to as the '''African Free Trade Area''' in some official documents and press releases.

In May 2012 the idea was extended to also include [[ECOWAS]], [[ECCAS]] and AMU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-05/26/c_123195304.htm |title=Africa free trade zone in operation by 2018 |publisher=Xinhua |date=26 May 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, at the [[African Union]] Summit in [[South Africa]], negotiations were launched to create a [[African Continental Free Trade Area|Continental Free Trade Area]] (CFTA) with all 55 African Union states by 2017.&lt;ref name=ICTSD&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luke|first1=David|last2=Sodipo|first2=Babajide|title=Launch of the Continental Free Trade Area: New prospects for African trade?|url=http://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges-africa/news/launch-of-the-continental-free-trade-area-new-prospects-for-african|accessdate=26 December 2015|publisher=International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signing==
The leaders of the three AFTZ trading blocks, COMESA, EAC, and SADC, announced the agreement, with the aim of creating a single free trade zone to be named the African Free Trade Zone, consisting of 26 countries with a GDP of an estimated US$624bn (£382.9bn). It was hoped that the African Free Trade Zone agreement would ease access to markets within the AFTZ zone and end problems due to several of the member countries in the AFTZ belonging to multiple regional groups.

The African Free Trade Zone announced at the EAC-SADC-COMESA Summit (also known the AFTZ Summit and Tripartite Summit) effectively is the realization of a dream more than a hundred years in the making, a trade zone spanning the length of African continent from [[Cape to Cairo Road|Cape to Cairo]], from North African [[Egypt]] all the way to the southernmost tip of Africa in South Africa ([[Cape Town]]). The Cape to Cairo dream was envisioned by [[Cecil Rhodes]] and other British imperialists in the 1890s and was expressed in different contexts and versions including, but not limited to, the following ideals: Cape to Cairo Road, Cape to Cairo Railway, Cape to Cairo Telegraph, and Cape to Cairo Trade Union.

While other powers, notably Germany and [[Portugal]] had colonies or [[spheres of influence]] in the Cape to Cairo trade zone contemplated, the primary benefactor of the Cape to Cairo union would have been the Great Britain and [[British Empire]]. The biggest difference in the idea of the original Cape to Cairo zone and its current incarnation is that the African Free Trade Zone is the creation of African Countries for the mutual benefit and development of the AFTZ member countries, their peoples and the whole of continent of Africa rather than a trade zone for the benefit of Great Britain. Ultimately, it is hoped the AFTZ would serve as a key building block to [[African Unity]] and the realization of a united Africa under the auspices of the [[African Union]].

Another important difference between the original and current ideal is that the AFTZ encompasses an area greater than the one even Cecil Rhodes could have imagine. The original Cape to Cairo idea in Cecil Rhodes' time and now under the AFTZ is a free trade zone spanning the whole continent from Cape Town in South Africa to [[Cairo]] in Egypt. Cecil Rhodes' Cape to Cairo would have involved at most a dozen countries. The current rendition of the Cape to Cairo zone actualized by the AFTZ encompasses most of Africa, almost half of the countries (26 out of 54), more than half of the production, trade, population, land mass and resources. If it actualizes its potential and becomes a truly integrated economic union, the AFTZ could actually rival any other economic union with its vast natural resources, huge markets, young population, and great technical know-how (mostly courtesy of SADC in general and the Republic of South Africa in particular).

In addition to eliminating duplicative membership and the problem of member states also participating in other regional economic cooperation schemes and regional political and security cooperation schemes that may compete with or undermine each other, the African Free Trade Zone further aims to strengthen the AFTZ block's bargaining power when negotiating international deals.

Analysts believe that the African Free Trade Zone agreement will help intra-regional trade and boost growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7684903.stm | work=BBC News | title=African free trade zone is agreed | date=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFTZ is considered a major step in the implementation of the AEC, an organization of African Union states establishing grounds for mutual economic development among the majority of African states. The stated goals of the AEC organization include the creation of free trade areas, customs unions, a single market, a central bank, and a common currency thus establishing an economic and monetary union for the African Union.

==The trade blocs==
The three trade blocs that agreed to and make up the AFTZ, the COMESA, the EAC and the SADC, are already well-established in their own right and cover varying swathes of land, economic systems, political systems and a varied number of peoples (which includes Arabs in the North, multi-racial peoples in the East and South, including significant numbers of [[White Africans|Africans of European descent]], Asian Africans, including Indians, Chinese and other Asian groups as well as Colored Africans—mixed race Africans numbering millions in South Africa). Many of the membership of the three AFTZ member trade blocks overlap with several countries being a member of more than one of the AFTZ member trade blocks as well as a member of other alliances within and without the three trade blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SADC COMESA EAC Joint summit to tackle overlapping membership |first= |last= |publisher=SADC Today |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.sardc.net/editorial/sadctoday/view.asp?vol=697&amp;pubno=v11n2 |accessdate=7 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720012815/http://www.sardc.net/editorial/sadctoday/view.asp?vol=697&amp;pubno=v11n2 |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic significance of the AFTZ==
The [[EAC-SADC-COMESA Summit]] is considered historic because for the first time, since the birth of the [[African Union]], several key building blocks of the AEC have met on how to integrate territories and moving towards deepening and widening integration within the overall [[Abuja Treaty]] for the establishment of the AEC. Further, for the first time a truly transcontinental union came into being, ranging from the north to the south of the continent. The AFTZ (EAC, COMESA and SADC) currently have a combined population of 527 million and combined GDP of US$625 billion. In size and capacity, the AFTZ rivals most trade blocks. 

The SADC is the largest of the AFTZ member trade blocks and covers a population of some 248 million people and a zone whose cumulative GDP is $379bn in 2006.

COMESA was established in 1994 as a replacement for the Preferential Trade Area. It includes 20 nations, with a combined GDP of US$286.7bn in 2006. Among its members are [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]], [[Uganda]] and [[Sudan]].

The EAC, the smallest of the member trade blocks in terms of GDP, had a GDP of US$46.6bn in 2006.

===SA President on AFTZ===
President [[Kgalema Motlanthe]] of South Africa speaking in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]], at a meeting of Africa's three regional economic communities, argues that the AFTZ is an important step in the integration of African economies and the eventually union of the continent. With the great uncertainty in the global economy following the food and energy price increases and, more recently, the upheavals in the financial markets, Motlanthe suggested that the advent of the AFTZ could not have been any more timely.

While African and other developing countries had marginal influence over the decisions that had brought the international financial system to the brink of collapse, unjustifiably, the poor and vulnerable of these countries would bear the brunt of the economic downturn.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is imperative that effective remedial measures are developed to mitigate the negative impact of the crises, and developing countries must now be included in the governance of international financial institutions," Motlanthe said.

At the same time, it was necessary to work towards a more equitable global trade regime that put the concerns of developing countries, including African countries, at its centre.

He also urged that the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), the Eastern African Community (EAC), and Southern African Development Community (SADC), increase co-operation towards greater integration.

"The process we embark upon today marks a historic step towards fulfilling our obligations under the African Union and the Abuja Treaty framework of continental integration, which recognises that Regional Economic Communities are the building-blocks for the African Economic Community."

The time had come for Comesa, EAC and SADC to bring together their respective regional integration programmes to further enlarge their markets, unlock productive potential, increase the levels of intra-Africa trade, and enhance developmental prospects.

"As a next step in expanding regional markets in Africa, the process we launch today will place us in a stronger position to respond effectively to intensifying global economic competition and will begin to overcome the challenges posed by multiple memberships of regional organisations.

"Let us therefore take the necessary decisions to work systematically and with determination to establish a single free trade area that will weld together our three regions into one," &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Antarctica New Zealand''' is an Institute set up by the [[New Zealand Government]] in 1996 to manage its interests in [[Antarctica]] and the Ross Sea.  As well as providing logistics support to a large scientific programme, it also runs bases such as [[Scott Base]].  It has run other bases in the past, such as [[Vanda Station]].

New Zealand's involvement in Antarctica began in 1923, when activities were closely connected with the [[United Kingdom]]. Close cooperation with other nations has been an important part of New Zealand's involvement in Antarctica. 

Since 1959 Scott Base has been New Zealand's permanent base in Antarctica.  From 1965 to 1988 the person responsible for much of Scott Base development as head of the Antarctic Division of the DSIR was Bob Thornton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/archive/national-news/206712/Giant-of-Antarctica-saved-Scott-Base |title=  Giant of Antarctica saved Scott Base  |publisher=  Stuff (Fairfax) |date= 18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1994 review recognised Antarctica as strategically important to New Zealand as a Southern Hemisphere nation. This resulted in the establishment of the New Zealand Antarctic Institute, known as Antarctica New Zealand, on 1 July 1996.

The Institute reports to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)|Ministry Of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] (MFAT) Antarctic Policy Unit. It is a [[Crown entities|Crown entity]], and has a CEO and a Board. Members of the Board are appointed for three years by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade in consultation with the Board Chair. This period may be extended by the Minister for up to a further three years.

Members are collectively accountable to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the performance of Antarctica New Zealand. All delegated functions and powers within Antarctica New Zealand arise from the Board's delegations.

The Board’s role is governance. Specific functions within this overall role include setting the strategic direction of Antarctica New Zealand and developing policy in a manner consistent with the organisation’s statutory framework, for example through the Annual Business Plan, ensuring compliance with the law, accountability documents and relevant Crown expectations. This includes financial responsibility for all money received by the Crown and reinforcing expectations of behaviour that are appropriate to a public body, appointing the Chief Executive, monitoring the performance of Antarctica New Zealand and the Chief Executive, and maintaining appropriate relationships with the Minister, Parliament and the public. This includes accounting for the performance and management of the organisation. 

The Chief Executive is responsible for the staffing and management of Antarctica New Zealand. 
  
In August 2018 Peter Beggs the chief executive from 2014 was asked to resign immediately by the board. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/106383710/antarctica-nz-chief-executive-resigns-suddenly-after-boardroom-discussions |title=  Antarctica NZ chief executive resigns suddenly after boardroom discussions  |publisher=  Stuff (Fairfax) |date= 19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/106426222/antarctica-nz-chief-executive-peter-beggs-was-sacked |title=  Antarctica NZ chief-executive Peter Beggs was sacked  |publisher=  Stuff (Fairfax) |date= 20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/9441388/Antarctica-NZ-boss-is-coolest-dad |title=  Antarctica NZ (new) boss is coolest Dad  |publisher=  Stuff (Fairfax) |date= 26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/106392145/antarctica-nz-acting-chief-executive-named-in-wake-of-peter-beggs-sudden-exit |title= Antarctica NZ acting chief executive named in wake of Peter Beggs sudden exit |publisher=  Stuff (Fairfax) |date= 19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1512">[[Image:Zorn Cachucha.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dance notation|Dance score]] for ''La Cachucha'', by Friedrich Albert Zorn.]]

'''Cachucha''' is a Spanish solo dance in 3/4 to 3/8 time, similar to [[Bolero]]. Cachucha is danced to an [[Andalusia]]n national song with castanet accompaniment. 

== Etymology ==

From Spanish ''cachucha'', small boat. Possibly from diminutive of ''cacho'', shard, saucepan, probably from vulgar Latin ''cacculus'', alteration of Latin ''caccabus'', pot, from Greek ''kakkabos'', a small container.

== History ==

The Cachucha was created in [[Cuba]] though it is now considered a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[dance]]. [[Fanny Elssler]] (1810-1884, Vienna) popularized this dance when she introduced it to the public in the ballet from [[Rossini]]'s opera ''[[La donna del lago]]'' in 1830's [[London]], and cemented its fame in [[Jean Coralli]]'s ballet ''Le Diable boiteux'' (1836, [[Vienna]]).

[[Gilbert and Sullivan]] sets the dance for the entire company in Act 2 of the Savoy Opera ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' as the chorus sings ''Dance a Cachucha''.

The '''Central Bank of Malta''' ({{lang-mt|Bank Ċentrali ta’ Malta}}) is the [[central bank]] of the Republic of [[Malta]].  It was established on 17 April 1968. In May 2004, when Malta joined the [[European Union]], it became an integral part of the [[European System of Central Banks]]. It was responsible for, amongst other things, issuing Maltese lira banknotes and coins, before Malta adopted the euro in 2008 and the Bank became part of the Eurosystem.

The Central Bank of Malta Act was originally published by means of Act XXXI of 1967. It has been amended a number of times, most recently by Acts I and IV of 2007 in order to provide for the Bank’s membership within the Eurosystem.

The Central Bank of Malta is located in an early 20th-century building. Completed in 1924 as the [[Vernon Institute]], or Vernon Club. The bank occupied the building since 1967, but made arrangement for the lease of the premises in 1968, with a contract lasting almost hundred years. The interior was eventually demolished in 1968, keeping the neoclassic façade, to be redeveloped and housing the present Central Bank of Malta. Since 2004 the building was bought from the [[Government of Malta]] and by the bank.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160215174954/http://www.centralbankmalta.org/history-of-premises History of premises].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Chansons pour ceux qui s'aiment"''' ([[English language|English]] translation: "Songs For Those Who Love Each Other") was the [[Luxembourg]]ish entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976]], performed in [[French language|French]] by [[Germany|German]] [[schlager]] singer [[Jürgen Marcus]].

The song is a ballad, with Marcus singing about the power of love songs to remain in the memories of those who hear them regardless of the other events in the world. Marcus also recorded the song in his native [[German language|German]] under the title "Der Tingler singt für euch alle".

The song was performed fifth on the night, following [[Israel]]'s [[Chocolate, Menta, Mastik]] with "[[Emor Shalom]]" and preceding [[Belgium]]'s [[Pierre Rapsat]] with "[[Judy et Cie]]". At the close of voting, it had received 17 points, placing 14th in a field of 18.

It was succeeded as [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourgish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1977|1977 contest]] by [[Anne-Marie Besse]] with "[[Frère Jacques (Anne-Marie Besse song)|Frère Jacques]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1470">The '''Consulates of the Orange Free State''' formed the official representation of this [[Boer]] republic abroad, and were established in several European states and in the [[United States of America]] between 1855 and 31 May 1902, when the republic ceased to exist.

The first, and throughout the existence of the republic, most important consular post was the [[Consulate General]] of the [[Orange Free State]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Between 1871 and 1902, the consul general in the Netherlands at times also held diplomatic prerogatives, with the title of 'special envoy'. In this capacity the incumbent was charged with negotiating and concluding treaties with other states and international organisations on behalf of the Orange Free State government.

The '''Contract Act, 1872''' is the chief [[contract law]] in Bangladesh. Based on [[English contract law]] and the [[Indian Contract Act 1872|British Indian contract law]], it was enacted in the 19th century and re-enacted by the Parliament of Bangladesh after the country's independence. It includes chapters on [[offer and acceptance]], voidable contracts, contingent contracts, performance, [[breach of contract]], contractual relations, the sale of goods, bailment, agency and [[partnership]]. It also covers topics such as [[consideration]], [[misrepresentation]] and indemnity.&lt;ref&gt;http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/chapter.php?act_name=The%20Contract%20Act,%201872%20&amp;vol=&amp;id=26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.dhakatribune.com/weekend/2014/jul/12/contract-killer&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Daimler Co Ltd v Continental Tyre and Rubber Co (Great Britain) Ltd''''' [1916] 2 AC 307 is a [[UK company law]] case, concerning the concept of "control" and enemy character of a company. It is usually discussed in the context of [[lifting the corporate veil]], however it is merely an example of where the corporate veil is not in issue as a matter of company law, since the decision turns on correct interpretation of a statute.

==Facts==
All except one of [[Continental AG|Continental Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd’s]] shares were held by German residents and all directors were German residents. The secretary was English. Continental Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd supplied tyres to [[Daimler Company|Daimler]], but Daimler was concerned that making payment might contravene a common law offence of trading with the enemy as well as a proclamation issued under s 1(2) [[Trading with the Enemy Act 1914]]. Daimler brought the action to determine if payment could be made, given that it was the [[First World War]].

==Judgment==
At first instance, [[Thomas Edward Scrutton|Scrutton J]] approved the decision of the master, that the contracts were valid, for summary judgment without proceeding to trial.

===Court of Appeal===
[[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Lord Reading CJ]], [[Herbert Cozens-Hardy, 1st Baron Cozens-Hardy|Cozens-Hardy LJ]], Phillimore LJ, Pickford LJ and [[ William Rann Kennedy|Kennedy LJ]], affirmed the decision too, holding there would be no offence.&lt;ref&gt;[1915] 1 KB 893, decided on 15 January 1915&lt;/ref&gt; They held the company did not change its character because of the outbreak of war. The say it, "remains an English company regardless of the residence of its shareholders or directors either before or after the declaration of war." Mr Gore-Browne argued, for Daimler Co Ltd, that the technicality should be swept aside in time of war. But Lord Reading CJ replied that the fact of incorporation was not just a ‘technicality’. The company, he said,

{{Cquote|is a living thing with a separate existence which cannot be swept aside as a technicality. It is not a mere name or mask or cloak or device to conceal the identity of persons and it is not suggested that the company was formed for any dishonest or fraudulent purpose. It is a legal body clothed with the form prescribed by the legislature…’}}

He relied on ''[[Janson v Driefontein Consolidated Mines]]'', where Lord Macnaghten, Lord Brampton and [[Lord Lindley]], holding that a foreign corporation does not become British because its means all are.

[[Henry Buckley, 1st Baron Wrenbury|Buckley LJ]] delivered a dissenting judgment, would have held that though the company is a legal person existing apart from its corporators, that it still had enemy character.

{{Cquote|The artificial legal person called the corporation has no physical existence. It exists only in contemplation of law. It has neither body, parts, nor passions. It cannot wear weapons nor serve in the wars. It can be neither loyal nor disloyal. It cannot compass treason. It can be neither friend nor enemy. Apart from its corporators it can have neither thoughts, wishes, nor intentions, for it has no mind other than the minds of the corporators. These considerations seem to me essential to bear in mind in determining the present case.}}

===House of Lords===
The House of Lords unanimously reversed the decisions below, saying the secretary was authorised to commence no action. It held the company was capable of acquiring enemy character.&lt;ref&gt;[1916] 2 A. C. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Parker said, {{Cquote|I do not think, however, that it is a necessary corollary of this reasoning [Salomon] to say that the character of its corporators must be irrelevant to the character of the company; and this is crucial, for the rule against trading with the enemy depends upon enemy character.}}

Just like a natural person can have enemy character though born in the UK, so can a legal person.

{{Cquote|I think that the analogy is to be found in control, an idea which, if not very familiar in law, is of capital importance and is very well understood in commerce and finance. The acts of a company’s organs, its directors, managers, secretary, and so forth, functioning within the scope of their authority, are the company’s acts and may invest it definitely with enemy character… it must at least be prima facie relevant… Certainly I have found no authority to the contrary.}}

The Earl of Halsbury LC, Lord Atkinson, Viscount Mersey, Lord Kinnear and Lord Sumner concurred. Lord Shaw and Lord Parmoor concurred in the result but dissented on this point.

==Significance==
Around the start of [[World War II]] the [[Trading with the Enemy Act 1939]] section 2(1)(c) was implemented to state the position in ''Daimler'', namely "so long as the body is controlled by a person who, under this section, is an enemy". In ''[[Bermuda Cablevision Ltd v Colica Trust Co Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1998] 1 BCLC 1, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Steyn made the point that, "Expressions such as ‘control’ and ‘controlling interest’ take their colour from the context in which they appear. There is no general rule as to what the word ‘controlled’ means…. The expression must be given the meaning which the context requires."

The concept of a company's character was also seen in the ill-fated [[Merchant Shipping Act 1988]] said that only fishing vessels registered as ‘British’ were eligible to fish for the UK quota, and a ‘British’ company had to be 75% British owned. However, in ''[[R (Factortame) v Secretary of State for Transport (No 3)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1992] QB 680&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Court of Justice]] held that this was contrary to art 52 TEC, and the right to [[freedom of establishment]].

The '''Data Intercept Technology Unit''' (DITU, pronounced DEE-too) is a unit of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) of the United States, which is responsible for intercepting telephone calls and e-mail messages of terrorists and foreign intelligence targets inside the US. It is not known when DITU was established, but the unit already existed in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~markp/htmls/Echelon1.pdf Going for the throat: Carnivore in an Echelon World - Part I]&lt;/ref&gt; 

DITU is part of the FBI's Operational Technology Division (OTD), which is responsible for all technical intelligence collection, and is located at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]] in Virginia, which is also the home of the FBI's training academy. In 2010, DITU had organized its activities into seven regions.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

== Internet wiretapping ==
=== Interception at Internet service providers ===
In the late 1990s, DITU managed an FBI program codenamed Omnivore, which was established in 1997. This program was able to capture the e-mail messages of a specific target from the e-mail traffic that travelled through the network of an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP). The e-mail that was filtered out could be saved on a tape-backup drive or printed in real-time.&lt;ref name="montclair"&gt;[http://pages.csam.montclair.edu/~robila/SECURITY/2008/pr7.pdf Internet Wiretapping – Government and Law Enforcement Use]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Omnivore was replaced by three new tools from the DragonWare Suite: Carnivore, Packeteer and CoolMiner.&lt;ref name="montclair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fp2013"&gt;Shane Harris, [https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/11/21/the_obscure_fbi_team_that_does_the_nsa_dirty_work "Meet the Spies Doing the NSA's Dirty Work"], ''Foreign Policy'', November 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carnivore (software)|Carnivore]] consisted of Microsoft workstations with [[Packet sniffer|packet-sniffing]] software which were physically installed at an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP) or other location where it can "sniff" traffic on a LAN segment to look for email messages in transit. Between 1998 and 2000 Carnivore was used about 25 times.&lt;ref name="montclair" /&gt;

By 2005, Carnivore had been replaced by commercial software such as [[NarusInsight]].&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,144809,00.html |title=FBI Ditches Carnivore Surveillance System|publisher=Foxnews.com|agency=Associated Press |date=2005-01-18 |accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report in 2007 described this successor system as being located "inside an Internet provider's network at the junction point of a router or network switch" and capable of indiscriminately storing data flowing through the provider's network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method|publisher=CNET News|date=January 30, 2007|url=http://news.cnet.com/FBI-turns-to-broad-new-wiretap-method/2100-7348_3-6154457.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The raw data collected by these systems are decoded and put together by a tool called Packeteer and these can be viewed by using a custom made software interface called CoolMiner. FBI field offices have CoolMiner workstations that can access the collected data which are stored at the Storage Area Network (SAN) of one of the seven DITU regions.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

In August 2013, [[CNET|CNet]] reported that DITU helped developing custom "port reader" software that enables the FBI to collect metadata from internet traffic in real time. This software copies the internet communications as they flow through a network and then extracts only the requested metadata. The CNet report says that the FBI is quietly pressing telecom carriers and Internet service providers to install this software onto their networks, so it can be used in cases where the carriers' own [[lawful interception]] equipment cannot fully provide the data the Bureau is looking for.&lt;ref name="cnet2013"&gt;Declan McCullagh, [http://www.cnet.com/news/fbi-pressures-internet-providers-to-install-surveillance-software/ "FBI pressures Internet providers to install surveillance software"], CNet, August 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the FBI, the [[Patriot Act]] from 2001 authorizes the collection of internet metadata without a specific warrant, but it can also be done with a [[pen register]] and [[trap and trace]] order, for which it is only required that the results will likely be "relevant" to an investigation. A specific warrant is needed though for the interception of the content of internet communications (like e-mail bodies, chat messages and streaming voice and video) both for criminal investigations and for those under the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]].&lt;ref name="cnet2013" /&gt;

=== Assisting NSA collection ===
[[File:Prism-slide-6.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Slide about NSA's [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] program which mentions the role of DITU in collecting the data]]
Since the NSA set up the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] program in 2007, it is DITU that actually picks up the data at the various internet companies, like Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Yahoo, before passing them on to the NSA for further processing, analysing and storing.

DITU also works closely with the three biggest American telecommunications providers (AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Sprint) to "ensure its ability to intercept the telephone and Internet communications of its domestic targets, as well as the NSA's ability to intercept electronic communications transiting through the United States on fiber-optic cables".&lt;ref name="fp2013" /&gt;

The latter is probably related to the NSA's collection of domestic telephony metadata, for which the FBI petitioned the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] to order the biggest American telecommunication carriers, like for example [[Verizon Business Network Services]], to hand over all the call records of their customers to the NSA.&lt;ref name="fp2013" /&gt;

An NSA document disclosed by the Snowden leaks gives the example of DITU "working with Microsoft to understand an additional feature in Outlook.com which allows users to create email aliases, which may affect our tasking processes."&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Greenwald, Ewen MacAskill, Laura Poitras, Spencer Ackerman, and Dominic Rushe, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data "Microsoft handed the NSA access to encrypted messages"], ''The Guardian'', July 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3597">==Date==
In [[Finland]], the usual way of writing dates in normal text is with the months spelled out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kotus.fi/?i=519&amp;s=2614#faq_519 Miten päiväys merkitään?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kotus.fi/sv/publikationer/sprakspalter/reuters_rutor/1991/rakneord_och_datum Räkneord och datum, Reuters ruta 11/1 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; The format varies according to the language used. In Finnish, a full stop is placed after the day to indicate an ordinal: “{{lang|fi|31. toukokuuta 2002}}”; furthermore, the month is in the [[partitive case]], always marked by ''{{lang|fi|-ta}}''. The month can also be written first, now in [[genitive case]] (the day and the abbreviated word ''päivä'', day, are in [[essive case]] as above): “{{lang|fi|toukokuun 31. pnä 2002}}”.{{cn|date=June 2017}} In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], the full stop is not used and the month is in nominative (without inflection): “{{lang|sv|den 31 maj 2002}}”.

The date can be preceded by the weekday (also lower case), in Finnish in [[essive case]]: “{{lang|fi|perjantaina 31. toukokuuta 2002}}”, “{{lang|sv|fredagen den 31 maj 2002}}”. The [[Finnish language]] has month names differing from most other languages; three letter abbreviations are not used in Finnish, and the months are not capitalised in either language (they are not considered proper names).

In the Sami languages ([[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]], [[Northern Sami]] and [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]]) the date can be given with the month first, but then spelt out in [[essive case]]: “{{lang|smn|vyesimaanu 31. p. 2002}}”, “{{lang|se|bearjadat, miessemannu 31. b. 2002}}”, “{{lang|sms|vue'ssmaan 31. p. 2002}}”.{{cn|date=June 2017}}
 
The all-numeric form for dates is in the order “day month year”, using a full stop as the separator. Example: “{{lang|fi|31.5.2002}}” or “{{lang|fi|31.5.02}}”. Years can be written with two or four digits, [[Y2K|nowadays]] usually with four, and numbers may be written with or without leading zero. The numeric form is often used in lists, letterheads, etc. Also a form with a [[slash (punctuation)|stroke]] is common in Swedish, especially in hand written text: “{{lang|sv|31/5 2002}}” or “{{lang|sv|31/5 -02}}”. The weekday may be prepended: “{{lang|sv|fredag 31/5 -02}}”.

The [[ISO 8601]] notation (“2002-05-31”) and FYI notation{{clarify-inline|reason='FYI notation' not explained or used on Wikipedia, is it a standard term?||date=June 2017}} (“5-31-2002”) are not used in normal text in Finland, but the former is used in some contexts (mostly machine generated).

Numbering of weeks are used in Finland, and are simply expressed as in "{{lang|fi|(viikko) 28}}; {{lang|sv|(vecka) 28}}" (''(week) 28'') in both writing (abbreviated {{lang|fi|v.}}) and speech, also labels and in computers' notation. The week begins with a Monday and week 1 is the week containing the first four-day week.

==Time==
The [[12-hour clock]] is often used in the spoken language and idiomatic expressions. The [[24-hour clock|24-hour notation]] is used in writing, with a full point as the standardised and recommended separator (e.g. “{{lang|fi|15.07}}” or “{{lang|sv|8.27}}”). However, colon is almost exclusively used instead of full point{{cn|date=June 2017}} in computing environments, especially in Sami languages. The conventions are the same for Finnish and Swedish.

[[Climate change]] is producing drastic changes to Earth processes and changing Earth's environmental status quo. Especially pertinent to human development is the threat of climate change on [[island nations]]. As sea levels continue to rise, island peoples and cultures are being threatened. As the former President of the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]], [[Christopher Loeak]], noted "In the last year alone, my country has suffered through unprecedented droughts in the north, and the biggest ever [[king tide]]s in the south; and we have watched the most devastating typhoons in history leave a trail of death and destruction across the region."&lt;ref&gt;Loeak, Christopher Jorebon. "A Clarion Call From the Climate Change Frontline." The Huffington Post. TheHuffingtonPost.com, n.d. Web. 28 Jan. 2016. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-jorebon-loeak/a-clarion-call-from-the-c_b_5833180.html. Website.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to combat these environmental changes are ongoing and multinational. Particularly notable is the adoption of the Paris agreement at the [[UN Climate Summit]] in Paris in 2015, which by no means an unqualified success, is certainly a step in the right direction in regards to fighting the effects of climate by aiming to slow the pace of global warming.

==Sea level rise==
One of the dominant manifestations of climate change is [[sea level rise]]. [[NOAA]] estimates that "since 1992, new methods of satellite altimetry (the measurement of elevation or altitude) indicate a rate of rise of 0.12 inches per year".&lt;ref&gt;"Is Sea Level Rising?" Is Sea Level Rising? NOAA, n.d. Web. 21 Feb. 2016. http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sealevel.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, NASA  calculates that average sea level rise is 3.41&amp;nbsp;mm per year and that sea level rise is directly caused by the expansion of water as it warms and the melting of polar ice caps.&lt;ref&gt;"Sea Level." NASA, n.d. Web. 21 Feb. 2016. &lt;https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ sea-level/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these changes are dependent on global warming and thus climate change. Sea level rise is especially threatening to low-lying island nations because seas are encroaching upon limited habitable land and threatening existing cultures. As [[Stefan Rahmstorf]], a professor of Ocean Physics at Potsdam University in Germany notes "even limiting warming to 2 degrees, in my view, will still commit some island nations and coastal cities to drowning." &lt;ref&gt;Sutter, John D. "Life in a Disappearing Country." CNN. Cable News Network, n.d. Web. 28 Jan. 2016. &lt;http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2015/06/opinions/sutter-two-degrees-marshall-islands/&lt;/ref&gt; However it is also important to consider recent research which contradicts the claim that rising sea levels will necessarily submerge island nations. Studies done by Paul Kench, a geomorphologist at the University of Auckland, have shown that "reef islands change shape and move around in response to shifting sediments, and that many of them are growing in size, not shrinking, as sea level inches upward". However at the same time Kench states that "for the areas that have been transformed by human development, such as the capitals of Kiribati, Tuvalu, and Maldives, the future is considerably gloomier" because these islands can not adapt to rising sea levels and are therefore greatly threatened.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/02/150213-tuvalu-sopoaga-kench-kiribati-maldives-cyclone-marshall-islands/{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other effects of climate change==
There are many secondary effects of climate change and sea level rise particular to island nations. According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service [[climate change]] in the Pacific Islands will cause "continued increases in air and ocean surface temperatures in the Pacific, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and increased rainfall during the summer months and a decrease in rainfall during the winter months".&lt;ref&gt;"Climate Change in the Pacific Islands." Climate Change in the Pacific Islands. US Fish and Wildlife Service, n.d. Web. 21 Feb. 2016. http://www.fws.gov/pacific/climatechange/changepi.html.&lt;/ref&gt; This would entail distinct changes to the small, diverse, and isolated island ecosystems and biospheres present within many of these island nations. As sea level rises island nations are at increased risk of losing coastal arable land to degradation as well as salinification. Once the limited available soil on these islands is salinified it becomes very difficult to produce subsistence crops such as breadfruit. This would severely impact the agricultural and commercial sector in nations such as the Marshall Islands and Kiribati.&lt;ref&gt;"Climate Change Impacts - Pacific Islands -." The Global Mechanism (n.d.): n.pag. IFAD. Web. 21 Feb. 2016. http://www.ifad.org/events/apr09/impact/islands.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition local fisheries would also be severely affected by higher ocean temperatures and increased ocean acidification. As ocean temperatures rise and the pH of oceans increases, many fish and other marine species would die out or change their habits and range. As well as this, water supplies and local ecosystems such as mangroves, are threatened by global warming. The tourism sector would be particularly threatened by increased occurrences of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and droughts.&lt;ref&gt;"Coping with Climate Change in the Pacific Island Region." Coping with Climate Change in the Pacific Island Region. GIZ, n.d. Web. 21 Feb. 2016. https://www.giz.de/en/worldwide/14200.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maldives==
The [[Maldives]] are an archipelago of far spread, low-lying islands and atolls located in the Indian Ocean. Climate change is severely threatening the very existence of the Maldives as well as diminishing existing human capabilities on these islands. According to the World Bank, with "future sea levels projected to increase in the range of 10 to 100 centimeters by the year 2100, the entire country could be submerged".&lt;ref&gt;"Climate Change in the Maldives." South Asia -. World Bank, n.d. Web. 21 Feb.2016 http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/0,,contentMDK:22413695~pagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:223547,00.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously this would seriously impact the culture and livelihood of all the citizens of the Maldives. As the President of the Maldives, [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]], notes "to the three hundred thousand inhabitants of the Maldives none of these threats compare, in magnitude and likelihood, to global climate change and consequent sea level rise." &lt;ref&gt;"National Adaptation Programme of Action." (n.d.): n. pag. Republic of Maldives. Web. 21 Feb. 2016. http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/napa/mdv01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the population of the Maldives lives on small, flat, densely populated atolls that are threatened by violent storms or even the slightest sea level rise. The capital [[Malé]] is especially threatened because it is on a small, flat, extremely densely populated atoll that is surrounded by sea walls, and other barriers to protect against storms. This means the Malé atoll can not change shape in response to rising sea levels and is increasingly reliant on expensive engineering solutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/02/150213-tuvalu-sopoaga-kench-kiribati-maldives-cyclone-marshall-islands/{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare against climate change and the resulting sea level rise, the national government of the Maldives has prepared a comprehensive National Adaptation Programme of Action, that attempts to critically consider and alleviate many of the serious threats the Maldives faces.&lt;ref&gt;"National Adaptation Programme of Action." (n.d.): n. pag. Republic of Maldives. Web. 21 Feb. 2016. http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/napa/mdv01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Maldives have already implemented several measures to combat sea level rise including building a wall around the capital of Malé and refurbishing local infrastructure, particularly ports. The Maldives is also taking the lead in attempting to arrest global climate change by instituting a goal of achieving a carbon-neutral economy by 2020. According to the former environment minister for the Maldives, Mohamed Aslam, it is a case of "'If Maldives can do it, you can do it. It's important to us not just to talk but to lead by example".&lt;ref&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/02/150213-tuvalu-sopoaga-kench-kiribati-maldives-cyclone-marshall-islands/{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the local economy of the Maldives is greatly threatened by climate change. One example is the tourism sector which is being threatened by the increased likelihood of violent storms, damage to coral reefs, and beach erosion.

==Marshall Islands==
The [[Marshall Islands]] are a collection of low-lying islands and [[atolls]] located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, all less than six feet in elevation. Due to the geographic and topographic situation of these islands, they are placed in a position of intense risk in terms of exposure to the effects of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=lRKzA3QULrE|title=Climate Change in the Marshall Islands}} [[American Museum of Natural History]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Of particular risk is the danger of sea level rise. Sea level rise has already encroached landwards and high tides and frequent storms continue to threaten local homes and property. Recent research indicates that sea levels have been increasing by 25millilitres per year. A one meter rise could result in the loss of 80 per cent of the Majuro atoll which is home to half the nation's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climate Change in the South Pacific: Impacts and Responses in Australia, New Zealand, and Small Island States|last=Gillespie &amp; Burns|first=|publisher=Kluwewr Academic Publishers|year=1999|isbn=0-7923-6077-X|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the underwater fresh water supply has been salinated by this influx of sea water. In 2013 over 200 homes were damaged in the capital [[Majuro]], and the airport was forced to close due to particularly high tides.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Coral, and Josh Haner. "The Marshall Islands Are Disappearing." The New York Times. The New York Times, 01 Dec. 2015. Web. 28 Jan. 2016. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/02/world/The-Marshall-Islands-Are-Disappearing.html?_r=0. Website.&lt;/ref&gt; To a certain extent the Marshallese are trapped on island, such as the Majuro atoll, when large storms or tides occur, having no recourse to higher grounds or neighboring islands. The geographic isolation of the Marshall Islands causes renders any disasters caused by climate change particularly destructive. Particularly dangerous are [[king tide]]s, especially high tides, which occur only a few times a year. To preserve their land and fight off tides and storms, residents have resorted to building private sea walls for their immediate protection.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Renee. "‘Nowhere to Move’: Marshall Islands Adapts amid Climate Change Threat." Adapting to Climate Change in the Marshall Islands. Al Jazeera, 19 May 2015. Web. 28 Jan. 2016 &lt;http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/5/19/Marshall-Islands-climate.html&gt;. Website.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study conducted by Murray Ford which compared aerial photographs of the Wotje Atoll of the Marshall Islands found that "shorelines interpreted from high resolution satellite imagery captured between 2004 and 2012 indicate that shorelines within this sample of islands are largely in an erosive state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.rse.2013.03.027 |title=Shoreline changes interpreted from multi-temporal aerial photographs and high resolution satellite images: Wotje Atoll, Marshall Islands |journal=Remote Sensing of Environment |volume=135 |pages=130–40 |year=2013 |last1=Ford |first1=Murray }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industries and livelihoods on the Marshall Islands are also threatened by climate change. Fisheries, particularly the tuna industry, are being forced to adapt to changing ecological inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2013.08.029 |title=Ecological risk assessment of the Marshall Islands longline tuna fishery |journal=Marine Policy |volume=44 |pages=239–55 |year=2014 |last1=Gilman |first1=Eric |last2=Owens |first2=Matthew |last3=Kraft |first3=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this the tourism industry of the Marshall Islands which was only recently developed and has even more potential to grow, is seriously threatened by sea level rise and violent storms which are natural tourist deterrents.
[[File:Ebeye Island.jpg|thumbnail|Satellite Image of Ebeye Island, Marshall Islands]]

Recently the Marshall Islands have begun to call for international aid to ameliorate the effects of climate change on the Marshall Islands. In equal measure, the Marshall Islands have called for a joint international effort to slow the rate of climate change, especially in regards to increasing sea levels. Following a drought in 2013, the US sent supplies to aid the Marshall Islands. There is also a historical precedent for the United States causing and then aiding the Marshall Islands when it comes to natural climate change and catastrophe. After testing fifty-four nuclear bombs on the [[Bikini Atoll]] in the Marshall Islands during the 1940s and 1950s, the United States paid $604 million in reparations. These reparations have gone someway, although arguably not far enough in helping to counter act the effects of nuclear fallout on the environment and the people of the Marshall Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Zak, Dan.

Web. 28 Jan. 2016. &lt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/11/27/a-ground-zero-forgotten&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that the United States is the "largest aggregate polluter of carbon dioxide" in the world, there has been some outcry among the global community to "hold the United States liable" for the effects of increased emissions and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Sutter, John D.

Web. 28 Jan. 2016 &lt;http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2015/06/opinions/sutter-two-degrees-marshall-islands/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, at the 44th Pacific Islands Forum summit held in 2013, the Marshall Islands proposed the "Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership to galvanise more urgent and concrete action on climate change".&lt;ref&gt;"NEWS: Marshall Islands Call for "New Wave of Climate Leadership" at Upcoming Pacific Islands Forum."

"UN Climate Summit: The Chance to Prove That We Are Climate Leaders." The Huffington Post. TheHuffingtonPost.com, n.d.

Website.&lt;/ref&gt; However certain challenges exist when it comes to communicating the effects of climate change in the Marshall Islands to the mainstream outside world and western media. Alternately problems also exist when it comes to transferring the western scientific notion of climate change to the people of the Marshall Islands. A study by Peter Rudiak-Gould recognizes the need for "climate change communicators" to "carefully consider the transformations introduced by various translations of ‘climate change,’ yet also appreciate ‘mistranslation’ for its ability to render concepts meaningful to local actors and to stimulate citizen–scientist dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.09.011 |title=Promiscuous corroboration and climate change translation: A case study from the Marshall Islands |journal=Global Environmental Change |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=46–54 |year=2012 |last1=Rudiak-Gould |first1=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt; On a national governmental level, the Marshall Islands has been extremely proactive, especially for a developing nation, in attempting to arrest climate change. The Marshall Island pledged to decrease emission levels for 2025 by 32% from 2010 levels, and by 2050 to have a net total of zero emissions. While announcing these targets the President of the Marshall Islands, [[Christopher Loeak]] noted that "going low carbon is in everyone’s interests. It improves our economy, our security, our health and our prosperity, particularly in the Pacific and more broadly in the developing world." &lt;ref&gt;Saddington, David. "Small Islands, Big Impact: Marshall Islands Set Bold Carbon Targets." The Huffington Post. TheHuffingtonPost.com, n.d. Web. 28 Jan.2016. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-saddington/small-islandsbig-impact-m_b_7834276.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While this action by the Marshall Islands is highly commendable, it will not have much effect on global emission rates which will be predominantly determined by the largest emission producers which include the United States and China.

Among the many efforts to protect the culture of the Marshall Islands is an effort to buy land and relocate the people to other locations. Currently several of the biggest relocation sites outside of the Marshall Islands are Hawaii, Washington state, and Springdale, Arkansas, where over 10,000 Marshall Islanders currently live. The Marshall Islanders living outside of the United States participate in Marshallese culture, including voting in national elections by mail.&lt;ref&gt;Sutter, John D. "Life in a Disappearing Country." CNN. Cable News Network, n.d. Web. 28 Jan. 2016 &lt;http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2015/06/opinions/sutter-two-degrees-marshall-islands/&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Marshallese who have resettled in Arkansas have encountered many cultural difficulties and differences between the Marshall Islands and Arkansas. Several examples include the different types of available food, the geographic setting, and the cultural institutions. As a result of sea level rise, one of the largest issues facing the Marshall Islands is how to preserve cultural and historical traditions if the Marshallese are forced to adapt to a new, totally different area potentially in a far away locale.

==Other island nations==
Climate change is not only affecting the Maldives and the Marshall Islands. All islands, especially low lying ones with coastal population centers, are threatened by the effects of climate change. Many of the Pacific Island nations like the Marshall Islands, including [[Tuvalu]] and [[Nauru]], are currently having to deal with rising sea levels. Tuvalu is a small Polynesian island nation located in the Pacific Ocean. It can be found about halfway between Hawaii and Australia. It is made up of nine tiny islands, five of which are coral atolls while the other four consist of land rising from the sea bed. All are low-lying islands with no point on Tuvalu being higher than 4.5m above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-16340072|title=Tuvalu country profile|last=|first=|date=24 August 2017|website=BBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside [[Funafuti]], the capitol of Tuvalu, sea level rise is estimated at 1.2 ± 0.8&amp;nbsp;mm/year.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, J.A. (August 12, 2002). "A Note on Relative Sea Level Rise at Funafuti, Tuvalu" (PDF). {{cite web|url=http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~johunter/tuvalu.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007232502/http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~johunter/tuvalu.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this, the dangerous peak high tides in Tuvalu are becoming higher causing greater danger. In response to sea level rise, Tuvalu is considering resettlement plans in addition to pushing for increased action in confronting climate change at the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/440734a |pmid=16598226 |title=Climate science: A sinking feeling |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7085 |pages=734–6 |year=2006 |last1=Patel |first1=Samir S. |bibcode=2006Natur.440..734P }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as island nations, nations with significant coastal low-lying topography, such as Bangladesh, and low-lying coastal cities, such as Miami, are also threatened by sea level rise.

'''Eutelsat 36B''' (formerly '''Eutelsat W7''') is a [[communications satellite]] in the [[W series (satellites)|W Series]] operated by [[Eutelsat]]. It is co-located with [[Eutelsat 36A|Eutelsat's 36A]] satellite at [[Celestial coordinate system|36°E]]. It was launched on November 23, 2009 14:19 GMT, by a Proton rocket.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Clark, Another Proton rocket mission ends in success, ''Spaceflight Now'', November 24, 2009,  [http://www.spaceflightnow.com/proton/w7/ on line www.spaceflightnow.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufactured by [[Thales Alenia Space]] in its [[Cannes Mandelieu Space Center]], based on a [[Spacebus 4000|Spacebus 4000C4]] platform, it features up to 74 K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band transponders (12 [[Watt|kW]]), a weight of about 5.5 [[ton]]s, and has a lifetime of about 15 years (up to 2024).

36B is one of the most powerful spacecraft in the fleet of Eutelsat. The craft can be configured to have up to 70 K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band transponders during its 15-year mission. Digital broadcasting and direct-to-home video services will be beamed to customers in Russia and sub-Saharan Africa using 36B.

The new satellite replaced all the capacity on the SESAT 1 (now [[Eutelsat 16C]]) platform, which was redeployed to 16°E after nearly 10 years of operations at 36°E.

36B's communications payload is connected to five downlink beams for Europe, Russia, Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia.

The '''Helsinki Police Band''' ({{lang-fi|Helsingin poliisisoittokunta}}) is the principal musical ensemble of the [[Helsinki Police Department]], which is a local agency of the [[Police of Finland]]. It mainly plays at official police ceremonies, as well as ceremonies of state, and various community events. The Helsinki Police Band plays a very important part in the department's public relations with citizens, with the band commonly representing the police department at many different national and international events. It was founded in 1946 as a way to improve relations between [[Helsinki]] residents and the police department. In its first year, the band served as a sort of hobby, however grew into an official musical unit one year later, in 1947. The 43 member band, is composed of part-time policemen who are employed in the traffic police apart from their role and services in the band. The band is composed of many smaller ensembles such as the [[Marching band]], the [[wind orchestra]], and the [[big band]]. Performances by the Helsinki band have historically been conducted with the participation of famous musicians and performers such as [[Robert Ambrose (conductor)|Robert Ambrose]] and [[Maria Ylipää]], in many different countries such as [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Estonia]], [[Russia]] and [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poliisisoittokunta.fi/en/orchestra/|title=Orchestra|last=|first=|date=|website=Helinski Police Band|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Joseon Tongsinsa''' were goodwill missions sent intermittently, at the request of the resident Japanese authority, by [[Joseon Dynasty]] [[Korea]] to Japan. The Korean noun identifies a specific type of diplomatic delegation and its chief envoys.  From the [[Joseon diplomacy|Joseon diplomatic]] perspective, the formal description of a mission as a ''tongsinsa'' signified that relations were largely "normalized," as opposed to missions that were not called ''tongsinsa''.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James Bryant. (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YIbNlliRswC&amp;pg=RA1-PA21&amp;lpg=  ''Frontier contact between chosŏn Korea and Tokugawa Japan,'' pp. 21–24.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Diplomatic envoys were sent to the [[Muromachi shogunate]] and to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] between 1392 and 1590.  Similar missions were dispatched to the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in Japan between 1607 and 1811.&lt;ref name="hyong-sik90"&gt;Sin, Hyŏng-sik. (2004). [https://books.google.com/books?id=o-WlUd3cjh0C&amp;pg=PT90&amp;dq=Japan+tongsinsa&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  ''A Brief history of Korea,'' p. 90.]&lt;/ref&gt;  After the 1811 mission, another mission was prepared, but it was delayed four times and ultimately cancelled due to [[Edo period#Decline of the Tokugawa|domestic turmoil in Japan]] that resulted in the establishment of the [[Meiji Restoration]] in Japan, after which Japanese relations with Korea took a markedly different tone.

==History==
Starting in 1392, many diplomatic missions were sent from the Joseon court to Japan. Not less than 70 envoys were dispatched to Kyoto and Osaka before the beginning of Japan's [[Edo period]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YIbNlliRswC&amp;pg=RA1-PA269&amp;lpg=RA1-PA269&amp;dq= p. 269 n. 89], citing ''Hanguk Chungse tae-il kysōpsa yŏngu'' (1996) by Na Chongpu.&lt;/ref&gt;  The formal arrival of serial missions from Korea to Japan were considered important affairs; and these events were widely noted and recorded.

Only the largest formal diplomatic missions sent by the Joseon court to Japan were called ''tongsinsa'' in [[Korean language|Korean]].  The term ''tongsinsa'' may be misused to refer to the practice of unilateral relations, not the international relations of mutual Joseon-Japanese contacts and communication.&lt;ref&gt;한일관계사연구논집편찬위원회. (2005). 통신사・왜관과한일관계 (''Han Il kwangyesa yŏngu nonjip''), Vol. 6, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Up through the end of the 16th century, four embassies to Japan were called "communication envoys" or ''tongsinsa'' – in 1428, 1439, 1443 and 1590.  After 1607, nine ''tonsingsa'' missions were sent to Japan up through 1811.&lt;ref name="kang35"&gt;Kang, Etsuko. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=4f0jnNzdRb4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=  ''Diplomacy and Ideology in Japanese-Korean Relations: from the Fifteenth to the Eighteenth Century,'' p. 35.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique pattern of these diplomatic exchanges evolved from models established by the Chinese, but without denoting any predetermined relationship to China or to the Chinese world order.&lt;ref&gt;Toby, Ronald P. (1991). [https://books.google.com/books?id=2hK7tczn2QoC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=korean+diplomacy+1711&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k4W8TZxzjN&amp;sig=Zi2nOmpTuZUK9bQL9ulL_Jnt47k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YJmtSeGQIeH8tgfknIWLBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA87,M1  ''State and Diplomacy in Early Modern Japan: Asia in the Development of the Tokugawa Bakufu,'' p. 87.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Edo period of Japanese history, these diplomatic missions were construed as benefiting the Japanese as legitimizing propaganda for the ''[[bakufu]]'' (Tokugawa shogunate) and as a key element in an emerging manifestation of Japan's ideal vision of the structure of an international order with Edo as its center.&lt;ref name="walker48"&gt;Walker, [https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/609/1/V10N2Walker.pdf p. 48;] Guilliaume, Xavier. (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=B6_5gb3W1SsC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=envoy+joseon+japan&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q=envoy%20joseon%20japan&amp;f=false  "Misdirected Understanding: Narrative Matrices in the Japanese Politics of Alterity toward the West," pp. 85–116] in ''Jahrbuch des Deutschen Instituts für Japanstudien.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KoreanEmbassy1655KanoTounYasunobu.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Impression of ''Joseon Tongsinsa'' mission in Japan – attributed to a [[Kanō school]] artist, circa 1655]]
After the Japanese invasion of the Korean peninsula (1592–1598), a new phase of diplomatic relations began.  The formal embassies were preceded by preliminary negotiations which began in 1600, shortly after news of the [[Toyotomi clan|Toyotomi]] defeat at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] was received by the Joseon Court.

As an initial gesture in a process of re-establishing diplomatic relations and as an earnest of future progress, some Joseon prisoners were released at [[Tsushima Island]].  In response, a small group of messengers under the leadership of [[Samyeongdang|Yu Jeong]] were sent to Kyoto to investigate further.  With the assistance of [[Sō Yoshitomo]], an audience with [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] was arranged at [[Fushimi Castle]] in [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref&gt;Kang, Jae-eun ''et al.'' (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=iB8R0oEH3kEC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;dq=joseon+Yu+jeong#v=onepage&amp;q=joseon%20Yu%20jeong&amp;f=false  ''The Land of Scholars: Two Thousand Years of Korean Confucianism,'' pp. 312–313.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1604, Yu Jeong confirmed the Joseon interest in further developing relations; the Tokugawa ''shōgun'' reciprocated by releasing 1,390 prisoners-of-war.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iB8R0oEH3kEC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=  p. 274.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==15th–16th century diplomatic ventures==
In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Joseon court labeled four large-scale diplomatic missions to Japan as  "communication envoys" or ''tongsinsa'' – in 1428, 1439, 1443 and 1590.&lt;ref name="kang35"/&gt;

In Japan's [[Muromachi period]] (1336–1573) and [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] (1568–1603), these Joseon-Japanese diplomatic contacts were considered important events.

==Hideyoshi's invasions==
{{main|Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)}}

Diplomacy was set aside in 1592 when Japanese armies invaded Joseon territory.  The ruptured bilateral relations were not restored immediately after the death of Hideyoshi in 1598; but the invading forces gradually withdrew from occupied land on the Korean peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4f0jnNzdRb4C&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=  p. 86.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th–19th century diplomatic ventures==
In the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, the Joseon leaders sent twelve large-scale delegations to Japan, but not all were construed as "tongsinsa" envoys. The embassies consisted of 400 to 500 delegates; and these missions arguably contributed to the political and cultural development of Japan in addition to the range of ways in which bi-lateral relations were affected.&lt;ref name="hyong-sik90"/&gt;

The 1607, 1617 and 1624 delegations were explicitly identified by the Joseon court as "Reply and Prisoner Repatriation Envoys," which were construed as less formal than a ''tongsinsa'' or "communication envoy."   The use of the term "tongsinsa" signified that relations had been "normalized;"&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James Bryant. (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YIbNlliRswC&amp;pg=RA1-PA21&amp;lpg=  ''Frontier contact between Chosŏn Korea and Tokugawa Japan,'' pp. 21–24.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the missions during the early Joseon era, Japan did not dispatch generals to greet the later Joseon missions, and only Joseon dispatched missions to Japan. However, this should not be taken as evidence that this form of diplomatic relations was unilateral or favored Japan – after [[Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea]], Japanese envoys were forbidden from traveling to [[Seoul]], and Japanese missions to Korea were halted at the Japanese residence in [[Busan]] (during the invasions, the Japanese invading armies had taken the route used previously by Japanese missions to Seoul from Busan); in addition, the cost of dispatching these missions was shouldered in their entirety by the shogunate in Japan (which, in the context of the three "communication" missions that served to normalize relations between Korea and Japan after 1598, seems equitable), which by some estimates equaled the annual budget of the shogunate in cost.&lt;ref name="english.historyfoundation.or.kr"&gt;[http://english.historyfoundation.or.kr/?sub_num=34 "Early Modern Period." Northeast Asian History Foundation, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028164240/http://english.historyfoundation.or.kr/?sub_num=34 |date=28 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan's [[Edo period]] (1603–1868), the Joseon-Japanese diplomatic contacts were considered significant events, with the exception of the 1811 delegation. The Joseon monarch's ambassador and retinue traveled only as far as [[Tsushima Island|Tsushima]]. The representatives of ''[[shōgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ienari|Ienari]] met the mission on the island which is located in the middle of the [[Korea Strait]] between the [[Korean Peninsula]] and [[Kyushu]].&lt;ref&gt;Walraven, Boudewijn ''et al.''

{{for|people who are notable for their short height but aren't the "shortest x"|List of people with dwarfism}}

This list includes the shortest ever verified people in their lifetime or profession. The entries below are broken down into different categories which range from sex, to age group and occupations. Most of the sourcing is done by [[Guinness World Records]] which in the last decade has added new categories for "mobile" and "non mobile" men and women. The worlds shortest verified man is Chandra Bahadur Dangi (pictured right), while for women [[Pauline Musters]] holds the record.

[[File:Chandra 03.jpg|thumb|right|At just {{convert|54.6|cm|in|abbr=on}}, Nepalese-born [[Chandra Bahadur Dangi]] was, at the time of his death in 2015, the world's shortest person ever verified.]]

'''''Love and Madness''''' is a 1780 [[Literature of the United Kingdom|English]] [[novel]] by [[Sir Herbert Croft, 5th Baronet|Sir Herbert Croft]]. It was based on the 1779 murder of [[Martha Ray]], the mistress of [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], by [[James Hackman]]. Its full title is '''''Love and Madness, a Story too True: in a Series of Letters between Parties Whose Names Would Perhaps be Mentioned Were They Less Known or Lamented'''''. The work proved very successful with many people initially believing that the fictional letters between the participants it contained were genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Martin p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

A large amount of the book was devoted to [[forgery]], with two forgers [[James Macpherson]] and [[Thomas Chatterton]], featuring prominently. The novel was apparently a major influence on [[William Henry Ireland]], the author of the [[Ireland Shakespeare forgeries|Shakespeare Forgeries]], who used the subplot about forgery as an inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce p.27-28&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland was himself reported to be an illegitimate son of Lord Sandwich by another mistress.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication History ==
An amended edition of this novel appeared in the spring of 1780 by publisher George Kearsley&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sentimental Murder|last = Brewer|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 152}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a campaign to promote the novel.

== Reception ==
The ''Morning Post'' initially received the letters well, and considered them instructive and inoffensive and painted a colourful picture of 'the dreadful consequences of the passion of love, unrestrained by virtue [...] which fill the mind at once both with horror and pity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = London Evening Post|last = |first = |date = 1 April 1780|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many [[Dance radio|dance music stations]], m2o does not play current and recent electronic music exclusively. Instead, a lot of club classics, rhythmic pop remixes/crossovers, and disco-era hits (dating back to as early as the [[1980s|1980's]]) can be heard frequently on m2o in many of its shows. Partly because of this reason it usually bills itself as an "energy music" station.

The station is broadcast [[free to air]] on [[Hot Bird]], on [[SKY Italia]] channel 700, on [[Alice Home TV]] channel 776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=700 lista canali Sky Musica|url=http://www.teleradioe.eu/lista-canali-sky-musica-700/|accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Digital Television]] channel 44 or 34.

'''ST12''' is an [[Indonesia]]n band formed in [[Bandung]], [[West Java]] in 2004. The group was formed by [[Ilham Febry]] a.k.a. Pepep (drummer), [[Dedy Sudrajat]] alias Pepeng (guitarist), [[Muhammad Charly van Houten]] a.k.a. Charly (vocalist), and [[Iman Rush]] (guitarist) (deceased). ST12 name stands for ''Jl. Stasiun Timur No. 12'', which is the band's headquarters. As of 2010, ST12 had produced 5 albums.

==History==
ST12 was officially formed on January 20, 2004, although its members had long been in the music world. Earlier, they were not known to each other. They often met in the rental studio on Jl. Stasiun Timur No. 12, Bandung. The band was named by Pepep's father, Helmi Aziz. Charly liked jazz, Pepep liked jazz and rock, while Pepeng grew up with rock music. After failing to get a recording contract, ST12 went indie (independent). Their debut album ''Jalan Terbaik'' was released in 2006. Unfortunately, during the promotional tour in [[Semarang]], Iman Rush died after a [[brain hemorrhage]] in October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kapanlagi.com/h/0000237324.html Charly ST12 Histeris di Panggung], diakses 27 Agustus 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of their debut album ST12 caught the attention of [[Trinity Optima Production]]. ST12 also released a second album ''[[P.U.S.P.A]]''(2008) in tribute to Iman Rush.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kapanlagi.com/h/0000237319.html ST12 Rilis Album Untuk Iman Rush], diakses 26 Agustus 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Charly and Pepeng quit from ST12 management and launched [[Setia Band]], but this name has been used by Setia Band from Lampung since April 14, 2010. In May 2012, one of the members from Lampung went to Jakarta to see Charly, but until now there are no news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azhie.net/2012/04/charly-pilih-alsa-jadi-drummer-setia.html |title=Charly pilih Alsa Jadi Drummer Setia Band |accessdate=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/186915 |title=Setia Band Sudah Terbentuk 14 April 2010 |date=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Indonesian division of [[Universal Music Group]] has reformed ST12 by joining the two new members, Rido Tuah and Koko, as Charly and Pepeng's replacement. In 2014, Dimas Moersas has joined the group as Rido Tuah and Koko's replacement.

Previously it had been the home of shows such as ''[[Brainiac: Science Abuse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvstudiohistory.co.uk/independent%20tv%20studios.htm#sky]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426060947/http://www.tvstudiohistory.co.uk/independent%20tv%20studios.htm |date=26 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studio facilities==
The studios at Osterley are currently located across three main buildings.

===Sky Studios / Harlequin 1===
Originally called Harlequin 1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable building for Sky|url=https://www.arup.com/projects/bskyb-harlequin-1|website=Arup|publisher=Arup|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Sky Studios building contains eight conventional studios located on the ground floor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arupassociates.com/en/case-studies/sky-studios/|title=Sky Studios :: ARUP ASSOCIATES|website=Arupassociates.com|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

*Studio 1 (50ft x 36ft approx) - football studio
*Studio 2 (36ft x 30ft approx) - typically a golf studio
*Studio 3 (36ft x 25ft approx) - a mixed use sports studio
*Studio 4 (66ft x 45ft approx)
*Studio 5 (52ft x 45ft approx)
*Studio 6 (45ft x 30ft approx) - new ''Sky News'' studio (including chromakey), used for ''[[Sunrise (Sky News)|Sunrise]]''
*Studio 7 (35ft x 30ft approx) - additional ''Sky Sports News'' studio, used for ''[[Soccer Saturday]]''
*Studio 8 (35ft x 30ft approx)

Studios 4 and 5 can be used together or separately thanks to a soundproof double door - combined, they are 122ft long. Due to the runners for the double-door, cameras cannot be tracked over the studio join. Shows such as ''[[Thronecast]]'', ''[[Skavlan]]'' and ''[[Harry_Hill#Harry_Hill.27s_Tea_Time_.282016.E2.80.93present.29|Harry Hill's Tea Time]]'' have been made in these studios. 

Studios 6, 7 and 8 have dock doors which open directly onto an access road, whilst studio 5 has a dock door with a short access tunnel before another door opening out onto an access road. Studios 1, 2, 3 and 4 have scene dock doors which open out onto a scene dock.

There are also a number of non-conventional studios located elsewhere in the building.
*''Sky Sports News'' Newsroom on the 1st floor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/watch/tv-shows/sky-sports-news-hq/photos/9394525/sky-sports-news-hq-images-from-the-new-studio|title=Sky Sports News HQ studio - Photos -  - Sky Sports|website=Skysports.com|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://recombu.com/digital/article/sky-sports-news-hq-first-look-at-the-new-studio|title=Sky Sports News HQ: First look at the new studio|website=Recombu.com|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sports bulletin studio for ''Sky News''
*''Studio 22 - Sky News'' down-the-line studio

There are eight production galleries on the ground floor alongside the conventional studios, with separate sound control rooms alongside each gallery. Any studio can be controlled from any gallery. ''Sky Sports News'' is controlled by Gallery 6. ''Sky News'' have a new gallery facility located on the second floor, alongside Studio 22.

===Sky 2===
*Studio F (60ft x 40ft approx, formerly Studio 6) - home of ''[[Soccer AM]]'' and ''[[The Pledge (UK TV programme)|The Pledge]]''
*Studio G (50ft x 40ft approx, formerly Studio 7) - currently out of use whilst being modified for ''[[Sky_Sports#At_the_Races|Sky Sports Racing]]''

Both studios share a covered scene dock but have separate production galleries. Studio F's gallery is located up a gantry from the studio floor, whilst Studio G's gallery is located on the same level. The ''[[Soccer AM]]'' and ''Game Changers'' exterior set is located next to these studios.

===Sky Central===
*Studio 21 - ''Sky News'' main studio - known as 'The Glass Box'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/sky-news-broadcasts-from-new-studios-for-first-time/|title=Sky News broadcasts from new studios for first time – Press Gazette|website=Pressgazette.co.uk|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This studio is currently controlled from the new gallery on the second floor of the Sky Studios building.

==Former studio facilities==
There are a number of buildings previously containing television studios which have now been vacated.

===Sky News Centre===

Vacated in early 2018 - with studio facilities moving to ''Sky Central'' and the ''Sky Studios'' building. Staff who previously occupied the Sky News Centre moved to a dedicated floor of the ''Sky Studios'' building.

*Studio A (8000 square feet approx) - former main ''Sky News'' newsroom, and previously the main presentation studio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscaststudio.com/2009/02/04/sky-news-updates-studios/|title=SKY News updates studios|website=Newscaststudio.com|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Studio B (40ft x 30ft approx) - previously a virtual reality studio
*Studio C (1000 square feet approx) - formerly home of ''[[5 News]]'' from 2005 to 2012
*Studio D - a small interview/presentation studio

The main Sky News gallery was, until January 2018, located behind Studio A and could regularly be seen in the background of shots, alongside Sky News' [[Network operations center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mattshearer.co.uk/2015/01/15/visit-sky-news/|title=Visit to SKY NEWS|website=Mattshearer.co.uk|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Żonqor Tower''' ({{lang-mt|Torri taż-Żonqor}}), originally known as '''''Torre di Zoncol''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ġrajjet Malta - It-Tielet Ktieb|date=2006|publisher=Department of Education|location=[[Sliema]]|page=81|edition=4|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a small [[watchtower]] near Żonqor Point, limits of [[Marsaskala]], [[Malta]]. It was built in 1659 as the eleventh of the [[De Redin towers]], on or near the site of a medieval watch post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zammit|first1=Vincent|title=Fortifications in the Middle Ages|journal=Civilization|date=1984|volume=1|page=33|publisher=PEG Ltd|location=[[Ħamrun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower commanded the entrance to Marsaskala Bay along with [[Saint Thomas Tower]]. It was demolished by the British military in 1915 to clear the line of fire of modern fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zammit|first1=Vincent|title=Il-Gran Mastri - Ġabra ta' Tagħrif dwar l-Istorja ta' Malta fi Żmienhom - L-Ewwel Volum 1530-1680|date=1992|publisher=Valletta Publishing &amp; Promotion Co.
