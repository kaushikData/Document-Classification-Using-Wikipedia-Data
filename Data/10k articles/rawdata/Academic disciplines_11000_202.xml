      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2753">'''Asset health management''' or ('''AHM''') is the field of study which looks at how to manage the "health" of an [[asset]] or assets.  This often includes methods to establish asset health and effort to decide the appropriate actions to be taken to manage the assets' health. This also includes the discussion of health at end of life to ensure the asset's full life is used efficiently.

Asset health management includes many different methods which can sometime overlap in their intended scope and methods.  Asset health management has become a difficult field to discuss due to the use of the same acronym to describe multiple different approaches and the use of the same approach with different names.  

Asset health management can be considered a subset of [[Asset management]]

==Asset health management taxonomy==
Asset health management consists of multiple strategies and parts but a rough description is given as follows.{{cn|date=July 2016}}
* Asset health [[diagnostics]]
: Methods used to establish the current health of the asset
* Asset health [[prognostics]]
: Methods used to predict how the health of the asset will change in the future
* Asset health maintenance
: see [[:Category:Maintenance]]
: including [[maintenance, repair, and operations]] (better referred to as maintenance, repair,and overhaul)  These methods are used to keep an asset health, restore health to an asset or through major work restore usable life to an asset.
* Asset end of life decisions
* Asset disposal

==Management of multiple assets==
There is often also a consideration of additional work done to manage the health of multiple assets within the same framework.
Sometimes referred to as Fleet health management and falling within the study of [[Fleet management]]. Although it is common to need to manage the health of multiple assets they are not always vehicles and frequently of mixed type.

When resources are constrained it is a fascinating management problem to consider how best to manage the health of assets.  It is rare that assets can be managed in an unconstrained way  as resources are always limited by a need to make efficient use of them.

==Asset health management relevant standards==
A collection of some standards which are often use to manage the health of assets.
This is not intended to be an exhaustive list and will organically improve.
* [[Open O&amp;M]]
* [[MSG-3]]

==Asset health management examples==
A short list is provided to illustrate the many methods that are some sort of asset health management method or philosophy.
* [[IVHM]]
* [[Built-in_self-test]]
* [[Built-in_test_equipment]]
* [[HUMS]]

''Jazz and the Classical Guitar Theory and Applications'', p.121. {{ISBN|0-7866-7236-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; '''C''' D '''E''' F{{music|sharp}} '''G{{music|sharp}}''' A{{music|sharp}}/'''B{{music|flat}}''' {{Audio|Whole tone scale on C.ogg|Play}}]]

The '''chord-scale system''' is a method of matching, from a list of possible [[chord (music)|chords]], a list of possible [[scale (music)|scales]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge 266"&gt;Mervyn Cooke, David Horn (2003). ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge companion to jazz]]'', p.266. {{ISBN|0-521-66388-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The system has been widely used since the 1970s and is "generally accepted in the [[jazz]] world today".&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer, Peter (2001). ''Jazz theory handbook'', p.115. {{ISBN|0-7866-5328-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the majority of older players used the chord tone/chord arpeggio method. The system is an example of the difference between the treatment of [[consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] in jazz and classical [[harmony]]: "Classical treats all notes that don't belong to the chord...as potential dissonances to be [[resolution (music)|resolved]]...Non-classical harmony just tells you which note in the scale to [potentially] [[avoid-note|avoid]]..., meaning that all the others are okay".&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, Carl (2002). ''The Piano Handbook'', p.126. {{ISBN|0-87930-727-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chord-scale system may be compared with other common methods of improvisation, first, the older traditional chord tone/chord arpeggio method, and where one scale on one root note is used throughout all chords in a progression (for example the [[blues scale]] on A for all chords of the [[blues progression]]: [[dominant seventh chord|A7]] E7 D7). In contrast, in the chord-scale system, a different scale is used for each chord in the progression (for example [[Mixolydian scale]]s on A, E, and D for chords A7, E7, and D7, respectively).&lt;ref name="Reed"/&gt; Improvisation approaches may be mixed, such as using "the blues approach" for a section of a progression and using the chord-scale system for the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Reed (2002), p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chord-scale A7 and A mixolydian.png|thumb|left|350px|Dominant seventh chord normally paired with mixolydian scale,&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;Reed, Scott (2002). ''Getting Into Guitar Improvising'', p.30. {{ISBN|0-7866-6247-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the fifth mode of the major scale.]]

The scales commonly used today consist of the seven [[musical mode|modes]] of the [[diatonic scale]], the seven modes of the [[minor scale|melodic minor]] scale, the [[octatonic scale|diminished scales]], the [[whole tone scale|whole-tone scale]], and [[pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] and [[bebop scale]]s.&lt;ref name="Spitzer 43"&gt;Spitzer (2001), p.43 and 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In the example below featuring C7#11 and C lydian dominant every note of the scale may be considered a chord tone&lt;ref name="Spitzer 43"/&gt; while in the example above featuring A7 and A mixolydian the scale is thought of as a 'filling in' of the steps that are missing between members of the chord.&lt;ref name="Reed"/&gt; Students now typically learn as many as twenty-one scales, which may be compared with the four scales commonly used in jazz in the 1940s (major, minor, mixolydian, and blues) and the two later added by bebop (diminished and whole-tone) to the tonal resources of jazz.&lt;ref name="C&amp;H 123"&gt;Cooke &amp; Horn (2003), p.123.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thirteenth chord C lydian dominant.png|thumb|right|350px|The corresponding scale for the [[Eleventh|C7{{music|sharp}}11 chord]], with added 9th and 13th tensions, is C [[Lydian dominant scale|lydian dominant]], the fourth mode of the ascending melodic minor.&lt;ref name="Spitzer 43"/&gt;]]

Originating with [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]]'s ''[[Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization]]'' (1959),&lt;ref name="C&amp;H 123"/&gt; the chord-scale system is now the "most widely used method for teaching [[jazz improvisation]] in college".&lt;ref name="Ake"&gt;Ake, David Andrew (2002). ''Jazz Cultures''. p.122. {{ISBN|0-520-22889-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is found in instructional books including [[Jerry Bergonzi]]'s ''Inside Improvisation'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerrybergonzi.com/books.htm|title=Jerry Bergonzi – books|publisher=Advance Music|accessdate=Jul 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and characterized by the highly influential&lt;ref name="Ake"/&gt; ''Play-A-Long'' series by [[Jamey Aebersold]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge 266"/&gt; There are differences of approach within the system. For example, Russell associated the C major chord with the lydian scale, while teachers including [[John Mehegan]], [[David Baker (composer)|David Baker]], and Mark Levine teach the major scale as the best match for a C major chord.&lt;ref name="C&amp;H 123"/&gt;

Miles Davis's ''Lydian Chromatic Concept''-influenced first [[modal jazz]] album ''[[Kind of Blue]]'', is often given as an example of chord-scale relationships in practice.&lt;ref name="C&amp;H 192"&gt;Cooke &amp; Horn (2003), p.192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chord-scale system provides familiarity with typical chord progressions, technical facility from practicing scales and chord [[arpeggio]]s, and generally succeeds in reducing "clams", or notes heard as mistakes (through providing note-choice possibilities for the chords of progressions), and building "chops", or virtuosity.&lt;ref name="C&amp;S 267"&gt;Cooke, Horn (2003), p.267.&lt;/ref&gt; Disadvantages include the exclusion of non-chord tones characteristic of bop and free styles, the "in-between" sounds featured in the blues, and consideration of directionality created between the interaction of a solo and a chord progression: "The disadvantages of this system may become clear when students begin to question why their own playing does not sound like such outstanding linear-oriented players as [[Charlie Parker]], [[Sonny Stitt]] or [[Johnny Griffin]] (or, for that matter, the freer jazz stylists)":&lt;ref name="C&amp;S 267"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The chord-scale method's 'vertical' approach...is 'static,' offering little assistance in generating musical direction through the movement of chords. Hence the importance of knowing the older chord tone approach. But...Swing- and bop-era songforms operate teleologically with regard to harmony. Highly regarded soloists in those styles typically imply the movements of chords...either by creating lines that voice-lead smoothly from one chord to another or by confounding the harmony pull through anticipating or delaying harmonic resolution.&lt;ref name="Ake 126"&gt;Ake (2002), p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Essential considerations of a style such as Charlie Parker's, including "rhythm, phrase shape and length, dynamics, and [[timbre|tone color]]," as well as "[[passing tone]]s, [[appoggiatura]], and '[[blue note]]s'" are unaddressed.&lt;ref name="Ake 126"/&gt; This appears to have led educators to emphasize a specific repertoire of pieces most appropriate to the chord-scale system, such as [[John Coltrane]]'s "[[Giant Steps]]", while excluding others, such as Coltrane's later styles of composition, and producing generations of "pattern" players among college-educated musicians.&lt;ref name="Ake 126"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2107">'''Dander''' is material shed from the body of humans and various animals that have fur, hair, or feathers. The term is similar to [[dandruff]], when an excess of flakes becomes visible. Skin flakes that come off the main body of an animal are dander, while the flakes of skin called dandruff come from the scalp and are composed of epithelial skin cells. The surface layer of mammalian skin is called the stratum corneum, which is shed as part of normal skin replacement.
 
Dander is microscopic, and can be transported through the air in [[house dust]], where it forms the diet of the [[house dust mite]]. Through the air, dander can enter the mucous membranes in the nose and lungs, causing allergies in susceptible individuals, largely through the mechanism of allergy to proteins in the bodies of the dust mites that live on dander. Dander builds up in carpets and in mattresses and pillows, so smooth surfaces predispose to an environment where levels of dander can be controlled more easily.   
More pet dander is sloughed off in older animals than in younger animals. Dander build up can be a cause of [[allergies]], such as [[allergic rhinitis]], in humans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.babyfirstyear.org/2009/07/is-your-carpet-making-your-child-sick.html&lt;/ref&gt; Damp dusting and vacuum cleaners with sealed bodies and fitted with [[HEPA]] filters reduce re-distribution of the dander dust, with associated dust mites, into the air.

An older etymology has it that dander is a dialect synonym of [[dandruff]], possibly from Yorkshire in England.&lt;ref&gt;OED&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2444">'''Dennis J. Hutchinson''' (born 1946) is a Senior Lecturer in Law at the [[University of Chicago Law School|University of Chicago]], and Master of the undergraduate College's New Collegiate Division where he directs the Law, Letters, and Society program. His interests primarily lie in the field constitutional law, paying special attention to issues of race. Indeed, he is perhaps best known within the legal community at large for his work as Editor of the Law School's ''[[Supreme Court Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/hutchinson&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutchinson graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from [[Bowdoin College]], and studied briefly as a JD candidate at Chicago before attending  [[Oxford University]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] in Jurisprudence, where he graduated with a BA and MA. Upon return to the United States, he completed his formal studies at the [[University of Texas Law School]], where he took an [[Master of Law|LLM]]. Hutchinson then served as a law clerk to Justice [[William O. Douglas]] and Justice [[Byron White]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. His biography of ''Whizzer White''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hutchinson-whizzer.html&lt;/ref&gt; was a ''[[New York Times]]'' 'Notable Book' for 1998.  He was once married to Judge [[Diane Pamela Wood]], who sits on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], and who remains an academic colleague.

Hutchinson was one of several law faculty members who were called upon by various media sources to provide commentary about President Barack Obama's tenure teaching constitutional law at the school, and was largely supportive.

'''Design/Build/Fly''', or '''DBF''', is a [[radio-controlled aircraft]] competition sponsored by the American institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics ([[AIAA]]), [[Cessna Aircraft Company]], and [[Raytheon Missile Systems]]. The [[Office of Naval Research]] was also a sponsor until 2006. The competition is intended to challenge the AIAA student branches of each university to design, build, and fly a remote controlled airplane that can complete specific ground and flight missions. Additionally, the teams are required to submit a comprehensive design report detailing the most important aspects of their designs.

The competition rules change every year. Usually, rules are published in late August and the competition fly-off is held in April. The rules define a mathematical formula used to determine the score for an entry. Recent competitions' formulas have used a combination of design report score, mission score determined by performance conducting one or more mission tasks at the fly-off, and Rated Aircraft Cost, a variable used to define the complexity of the design.

'''Distributed Proofreaders''' (commonly abbreviated as '''DP''' or '''PGDP''') is a web-based project that supports the development of [[e-text]]s for [[Project Gutenberg]] by allowing many people to work together in [[proofreading]] drafts of e-texts for errors. By July 2015, over 30,000 texts had been digitized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.pgdp.net/2015/07/07/celebrating-30000-titles/ |title=Celebrating 30,000 Titles &amp;#124; Hot off the Press |publisher=Blog.pgdp.net |date=2015-07-07 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Distributed Proofreaders was founded by Charles Franks in 2000 as an independent site to assist Project Gutenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first=Lawrence | last=Lessig | year=2009
 | title=Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy
 | page=109 | publisher=Penguin | isbn=0-14-311613-4
 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7eRPKIvEo9gC&amp;pg=PT109
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distributed Proofreaders became an official Project Gutenberg site in 2002.

On 8 November 2002, Distributed Proofreaders was [[Slashdot effect|slashdotted]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Volunteers%27_Voices#Suzanne_Shell|title=Gutenberg:Volunteers' Voices|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2002/11/12/distributed-proofrea.html|title=Distributed Proofreading's slashdotting|publisher=[[Boingboing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 4,000 new members joined in one day, causing an influx of new proofreaders and software developers, which helped to greatly increase the quantity and quality of e-text production. Distributed Proofreaders posted their 5,000th text to Project Gutenberg in October 2004, in March 2007, the 10,000th DP-produced e-text was posted to Project Gutenberg, in May 2009, the 15,000th DP-produced e-text was posted to Project Gutenberg, in April 2011, the 20,000th DP-produced e-text was posted to Project Gutenberg, and in July 2015, the 30,000th DP-produced e-text was posted to Project Gutenberg. DP-contributed e-texts comprised more than half of works in Project Gutenberg, {{as of|2015|07|lc=on}}.

On 31 July 2006, the Distributed Proofreaders Foundation was formed to provide Distributed Proofreaders with its own legal entity and [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] status. [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] approval of section [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] status was granted retroactive to 7 April 2006.

== Proofreading process ==

[[Public domain]] works, typically books with expired copyright, are scanned by volunteers or sourced from digitization projects and the images are run through [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) [[software]]. Since OCR software is far from perfect, a large number of errors often appear in the resulting text. To correct them, pages are made available to volunteers via the Internet; the original page image and the recognized text appear side by side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference
 |author1=Gentry, Craig |author2=Ramzan, Zulfikar |author3=Stuart Stubblebine | title=Secure Distributed ''Human'' Computation
 | booktitle=Financial cryptography and data security: 9th International Conference
 | page=329 | date=February 28 – March 3, 2005
 | volume=3570 | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science
 | editors=Andrew S. Patrick, [[Moti Yung]]
 | location=Roseau, The Commonwealth of Dominica
 | publisher=Springer | isbn=3-540-26656-9
 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JegO2ly7IccC&amp;pg=PA329
 | doi=10.1145/1064009.1064026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process thereby distributes the time-consuming error-correction process, akin to [[distributed computing]].

Each page is proofread and formatted several times, and then a post-processor combines the pages and prepares the text for uploading to Project Gutenberg.

Besides custom software created to support the project, DP also runs a forum and a wiki for project coordinators and participants.

== Related projects ==

=== DP Europe ===
In January 2004, Distributed Proofreaders Europe started, hosted by [[Project Rastko]], Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | first=Marie | last=Lebert | date=November 4, 2010
 | title=Distributed Proofreaders, producteur des livres du Projet Gutenberg, a 10 ans
 | language=French | work=Actualitté
 | url=http://www.actualitte.com/dossiers/1197-ebooks-projet-gutenberg-distributed-proofreaders.htm
 | accessdate=2011-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This site had the ability to process text in [[Unicode]] [[UTF-8]] encoding. Books proofread centered mainly on European culture, with a large proportion of non-English texts including Hebrew, Arabic, Urdu and many others. {{As of|2013|alt=As of October 2013}}, DP Europe had produced 787 e-texts, the last of these in November 2011.

The original DP is sometimes referred to as "DP International" by members of DP Europe. However, DP servers are located in the United States, and therefore works must be cleared by Project Gutenberg as being in the [[public domain]] according to U.S. [[copyright]] law before they can be proofread and eventually published at DP.

=== DP Canada ===
In December 2007, [[Distributed Proofreaders Canada]] launched to support the production of e-books for [[Project Gutenberg Canada]] and take advantage of shorter Canadian [[copyright]] terms. Although it was established by members of the original Distributed Proofreaders site, it is a separate entity. All of its projects are posted to Faded Page, their book archive website. In addition, it supplies books to Project Gutenberg Canada (which launched on [[Canada Day]] 2007) and (where copyright laws are compatible) to the original Project Gutenberg.

In addition to preserving [[Canadiana]], DP Canada is notable because it is the first major effort to take advantage of Canada's copyright laws which may allow more works to be preserved. Unlike copyright law in some other countries, Canada has a "life plus 50" copyright term. This means that works by authors who died more than fifty years ago may be preserved in Canada, whereas in other parts of the world those works may not be distributed because they are still under copyright.

Notable authors whose works may be preserved in Canada but not other parts of the world include [[Clark Ashton Smith]], [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Carl Jung]], [[A. A. Milne]], [[Dorothy Sayers]], [[Nevil Shute]], [[Walter de la Mare]], [[Sheila Kaye-Smith]] and [[Amy Carmichael]].

In [[politics]], '''dual loyalty''' is loyalty to two separate interests that potentially conflict with each other.

==Inherently controversial==
While nearly all examples of alleged "dual loyalty" are considered highly controversial, these examples point to the inherent difficulty in distinguishing between what constitutes a "danger" of dual loyalty – i.e., that there exists a pair of ''misaligned'' interests – versus what might be more simply a pair of ''partially aligned'' or even, according to the party being accused, a pair of ''fully aligned'' interests. For example, immigrants who still have feelings of loyalty to their country of origin will often insist that their two (or more) loyalties do not conflict. As Stanley A. Renshon at the Center for Immigration Studies notes,
{{quote|Lan Samantha Chang (1999), a novelist writing in response to the Wen Ho Lee case, could say in a ''New York Times'' op-ed piece entitled ''Debunking the Dual Loyalty Myth'', "True, many immigrants have strong ties to their countries of birth.&amp;nbsp;... But cultural or familial loyalties are on a different level from political allegiances&amp;nbsp;... I love China, but I am a citizen of the United States." Ms. Chang appears to want to distinguish a love for one's "home" country from being willing to commit treason against one's adopted one. This is obviously a fair, reasonable, and appropriate distinction.

Yet, in the process of making such a distinction, she acknowledges the duality of her feelings. The issue is not between love of one's country of origin and treason, but rather the multiple loyalties that appear to be part of many immigrants' psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Renshon|Stanley A. Renshon]].

===Transnationalist interpretations===
Some scholars refer to a growing trend of [[transnationalism]] and suggest that as societies become more [[heterogeneous]] and [[multi-cultural]], the term "dual loyalty" increasingly becomes a meaningless [[Bromide (language)|bromide]]. According to the theory of transnationalism, migration (as well as other factors including improved global communication) produces new forms of identity that transcend traditional notions of physical and cultural space. Nina Glick Schiller, Linda Basch, and Cristina Blanc-Szanton define a process by which immigrants "link together" their country of origin and their country of settlement.

The transnationalist view is that "dual loyalty" is a potentially ''positive'' expression of multi-culturalism, and can contribute to the diversity and strength of civil society. While this view is popular in many academic circles, others are skeptical of this idea. As one paper describes it,
{{quote|On occasion, these imagined communities conform to the root meaning of transnational, extending beyond loyalties that connect to any specific place of origin or ethnic or national group. Yet what immigration scholars describe as transnationalism is usually its opposite ... highly particularistic attachments antithetical to those by-products of globalization denoted by the concept of "transnational civil society" and its related manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Waldinger |first=Roger |last2=Fitzgerald |first2=David |date=March 2004 |title=Transnationalism in Question |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/soc/faculty/waldinger/pdf/B7.pdf |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=109 |issue=5 |page=1178 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Beyond its usage in particular instances, the term "dual loyalty" versus "transnationalism" continues to be the subject of much debate. As one academic writes:
{{quote|Although the events of September 11th may have shaken some assumptions – at least in the United States – about the nature of transnational networks and their capacity to facilitate flows of people, goods, and ideas across borders, the terms "globalization" and "transnationalism" remain relatively stable, albeit frustratingly imprecise additions to the language of social sciences, including anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wagner |first=Sarah |year=2002 |title=Putting a Face on Transnationalism: Migration, Identity, and Membership in the Transnational City of Johannesburg |page=2 |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~sewagner/johannesburg.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408221056/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~sewagner/johannesburg.pdf |archivedate=April 8, 2005 |postscript=. |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Historical accusations==
Other historical examples of actual or perceived "dual loyalty" include the following:
* During [[World War II]], a number of [[United States]] citizens of [[Japanese Americans|Japanese]], [[German Americans|German]], and [[Italian Americans|Italian]] [[ancestry]], including some born in the U.S., were confined to [[internment]] camps (see [[Japanese internment in the United States]]).
* [[Roman Catholic]]s are subject to the [[Pope]] on religious matters. This has often perceived as dual loyalty by powers opposed to the [[Holy See]].
** During the [[English Reformation]], many important English and Scottish figures, such as [[Thomas More]], [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and [[Edmund Campion]], were tried and executed for their alleged double loyalty to the Papacy and infidelity to the Crown.
** During the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] in 19th-century France, citizens were routinely divided between ''clericals'' and ''anticlericals'' because of long-lasting loyalty related conflicts between the French secularist government and the Holy See.
** During [[John F. Kennedy]]'s campaign for and brief [[Timeline of the presidency of John F. Kennedy|tenure as U.S. President]], some opponents questioned whether a Roman Catholic President of the United States had a divided loyalty with respect to the [[Papacy]] and [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanpresident.org/history/johnfkennedy/biography/theamericanfranchise.common.shtml AmericanPresident.org article on John F.

** The [[Roman Catholicism in China|Chinese Catholics]] have been forced by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] to substitute the Roman Catholic Church in China by the [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]].
* [[Jewish people|Jews]] in the [[Jewish Diaspora]] have been accused of dual loyalty by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the 1st century, by the [[French people|French]] in the [[Dreyfus Affair]] in the late 19th century, in [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin-era]] [[Soviet Union]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Zakim"&gt;[[Leonard P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9403">'''Dualistic Petri nets''' (dPNs) are a process-class variant of [[Petri net]]s.
Like Petri nets in general and many related formalisms and notations, they are used to describe and analyze [[process architecture]].


==Process Modeling with dPNs ==
A simple, yet powerful way to model [[process architecture]] is using the dualistic extension of Petri nets called dualistic Petri nets (dPNs).&lt;ref&gt;Dawis, E. P., J. F. Dawis, Wei-Pin Koo (2001).  Architecture of Computer-based Systems using Dualistic Petri Nets.  Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 2001 IEEE International Conference on Volume 3, 2001 Page(s):1554 - 1558 vol.3&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Petri net]] (PN) is a graphical, bipartite modeling language that intuitively and mathematically represent theoretical relationships of moving objects in a network of interconnected constructs.  Classical Place/Transition PNs can represent theoretical processes, where the movement of objects implies their transformation, but is too absolute to be pragmatic in representing real-world processes.  The real world is dualistic in nature and process is a dualistic phenomenon, this can not be easily represented using a digital-type modeling system.  Instead, dualistic extensions to Place/Transition PNs have been introduced and used successfully in modeling the architecture of computer-based systems&lt;ref&gt;Dawis, E. P. (2001).  Architecture of an SS7 Protocol Stack on a Broadband Switch Platform using Dualistic Petri Nets.  Communications, Computers and signal Processing, 2001. PACRIM. 2001 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Volume 1, 2001 Page(s):323 - 326 vol.1&lt;/ref&gt; and business processes.

:[[Image:DPNetSim.gif|frame|none|Animation of a Dualistic Petri Net Simulation: Rectangles = Transformations, Ovals = Places]]

Among the distinctions of dPNs from classical PNs is space and time (due to energy use) in both the place construct and transformation construct.  This results in the simulation effect of '''marked transformations''' that allow for the explicit representation of parallel processing, multiprocessing, and the implicit representation of deterioration of objects – all unique to dualistic Petri nets.

==Architecture==
Besides a propensity to modeling dualistic real-world behavior, PNs also offer a way to manage complex process systems hierarchically.  Using classical PN construction rules, Petri nets of Petri nets can be built and a hierarchical conception of a complex process system can be studied.  This structure of hierarchical abstraction is the heart of [[process architecture]]
===Bottom-Up: Starting with the manifested process===
Dualistic Petri nets are capable of modeling any process system at its manifested level.  When [[reverse engineering]] a manifested process, dPNs have a one-to-one correspondence of dPN construct to any manifested process piece, that is, it is [[isomorphic]] to the implementation language of the manifested process.  For example, several lines of software code could be represented by one dPN transformation construct.  Once the manifested process is completely represented by a network of dPNs, small, well-coupled groups of dPN constructs can be lumped together to form higher level dPN constructs – creating  a network of dPNs at a higher level of hierarchical abstraction.  Each level of abstraction is consistent with its adjacent levels of abstraction and the rules governing them at each level are the exactly the same because PN abstractions are [[homomorphic]].  Now the process design can be considered at various levels of abstraction as deemed appropriate by the process architect, allowing for studies in its dynamic behavior and performance.

A typical use of reverse engineering using dPNs in the business world is in the documentation of processes for quality certification against standards like [[ISO 9000]].  In this case, dPNs are used to model pieces of the business process, which are then combined to form an overall [[enterprise architecture]].  The process system can be studied to determine each piece's capability and show where risks occur.  Requirements are then reverse-engineered and applied at corresponding dPN constructs.  Trouble spot processes can be identified and slated for [[Business process reengineering|reengineering]].  The overall dPN map not only gives quality entities the necessary information about a business's current process, but it also gives the process architect a blue print from which to manage and [[kaizen|improve]] said processes.  This is a major portion of [[quality engineering]].
===Top-down: From Idea to Implementation===
dPN modeling of a new process system starts at a high level of hierarchical abstraction.  To design a complex process system, such as a sophisticated hardware component or a major project, the process architect must first define the problem space.  Since the problem space is itself a process system, dPNs can be used for its modeling.  Abstract dPNs that are yet to be implemented are specified within the context of the problem space.  These constructs define the solution space within its context network.  It is now up to the process architect to traverse down the hierarchical abstraction dimension, proposing new process designs for the solution space in an iterative manner until specifying the actual implementation in the specific implementation language.

This method for designing a complex process system is reflected in the general software development methodology known as the [[waterfall model]].  Actually, this method is not well-suited for the  development of complex software without adjusting it to handle the step-wise decomposition of the process architecture.  This decomposition occurs entirely within the domain of dPNs from the problem space context model down to the final mapping of the implementation language.
===Process Structure===
Whether a dPN hierarchical network map was created from the bottom up or from the top down, it shows the structure of the process system.  Complex process systems, such as large [[computer program]]s, will have several layers of hierarchical abstraction.  At the top of the structure is one process represented by a couple of dPN constructs.  Each subsequent layer below this process is the decomposition of the dPN constructs made up of more dPNs that are in turn decomposed.  The “parent” dPN of a set of decomposed dPNs has associated with it requirements that apply to the decomposed network.  These requirements were determined by studying the parent dPN's '''suprastructure''' or the hierarchical structure ''above'' the construct.  The decomposed “children” dPNs form the '''[[infrastructure]]''' or the hierarchical structure ''below'' the parent dPN.

:[[Image:DPNetStruct.gif|frame|none|Animation of a dPNet-modeled Process Architecture]]

In complex computer design, [[Requirements analysis|requirements are generated]] and infrastructures proposed.  Chosen infrastructures are then further decomposed by determining the new constructs' requirements and decomposing them further in this iterative fashion until the dPNs are decomposed into the implementation language of software or hardware specification.  The final hierarchical dPN map documents the architectural decisions that were accepted and a specification is in place that can be used to maintain the system's future evolution.

In [[business processes]], process requirements are [[policies]] that must be fulfilled by acceptable procedures.  Complex procedures can be specified by simpler procedures.  Since business processes are processes, dPNs are an ideal modeling language for them – especially when considering complex business processes like [[logistics]].

==Conclusion==
The entire network of dualistic Petri nets becomes the architecture specification of the process system.  If the problem and solution space are entirely in software, it is known as [[software architecture]].  If the problem and solution space are business processes, it is known as [[enterprise architecture]].  If the problem and solution space are networked equipment, it is known as [[network architecture]].  What is important to each of these applications and to any other process system of varying complexity is that the hierarchical map of the system's structure created by the network of dPNs allows the process architect to study the behavior and performance of the system, keeps architectural design decisions documented, and organizes process requirements along the architectural structure.

The '''Earth Similarity Index''' ('''ESI''') is a proposed characterization of how similar a [[planetary-mass object]] or [[natural satellite]] is to [[Earth]].  It was designed to be a scale from zero to one, with Earth having a value of one; this is meant to simplify planet comparisons from large databases. It has no quantitative meaning for [[Planetary habitability|habitability]].

== Formulation ==
The ESI, as proposed in 2011 by Schulze-Makuch ''et al.'' in the journal [[Astrobiology (journal)|''Astrobiology'']]'','' incorporates a planet's [[radius]], [[density]], [[escape velocity]], and [[Planetary equilibrium temperature|surface temperature]] into the index.&lt;ref name="Schulze-Makuch et al."&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schulze-Makuch, D. |author2=Méndez, A. |author3=Fairén, A.

An article on the [[preprint server]] [[arxiv.org]] attempts to reproduce the ESI using only the temperature and [[Planetary mass|mass]] of the planet.&lt;ref name="Chandra"&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1507.06293v1|class=astro-ph.EP|author=Suresh Chandra|author2=Subas Nepal|title=Earth Similarity Index with two free parameters|date=July 2015|author3=Mohit K.

For [[exoplanet]]s, in almost every case only the planet's [[orbital period]] along with either the [[transit method|proportional dimming of the star due to the planet's transit]] or the [[radial velocity method|radial velocity variation of the star]] in response to the planet is known with any degree of certainty, and so every other property not directly determined by those measurements is speculative. For example, while surface temperature is influenced by a variety of factors including [[irradiance]], [[tidal heating]], [[albedo]], [[insolation]] and [[greenhouse warming]], as these factors are not known for any exoplanet, quoted ESI values use [[planetary equilibrium temperature]] as a stand-in.&lt;ref name="Schulze-Makuch et al." /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{ESI} = \prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(1-\Big\vert\frac{x_i - x_{i0}}{x_i + x_{i0}}\Big\vert\right)^\frac{w_i}{n}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_{i0}&lt;/math&gt; are properties of the extraterrestrial body and of Earth, respectively, &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; is the weighted exponent of each property, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of properties. It is comparable to, and constructed from, the [[Bray–Curtis dissimilarity|Bray–Curtis Similarity Index]].&lt;ref name=esi /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rushby"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rushby, A.|year=2013|title=A multiplicity of worlds: Other habitable planets|journal=Significance|volume=10|issue=5|pages=11–15|doi=10.1111/j.1740-9713.2013.00690.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight assigned to each property, &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;, are [[free parameter]]s that can be chosen to emphasize certain characteristics over others or to obtain desired index thresholds or rankings. The webpage also ranks what it describes as the habitability of planets and moons according to three criteria: the location in the habitable zone, ESI, and a speculation as to a capacity to sustain organisms at the bottom of the food chain, a different index collated on the webpage identified as the "Global Primary Habitability scale".&lt;ref name="Sample"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/dec/05/habitable-exoplanets-catalogue-alien-life|title=Habitable exoplanets catalogue ranks alien worlds on suitability for life.|author=Sample, I.|date=December 5, 2011|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 ''Astrobiology'' article and the ESI values found in it received press attention at the time of the article's  publication. As a result, [[Mars]] was reported to have the second-highest ESI in the Solar System with a value of 0.70.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;  A number of [[exoplanet]]s listed in that article were reported to have values in excess of this, with [[Kepler-438b]] reported to have the highest ESI&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt; of [[Exoplanet#Confirmed discoveries|confirmed]] exoplanets at 0.88.

==No relation to habitability==
Although the ESI does not characterize [[planetary habitability|habitability]], given the point of reference is the Earth, some of its functions match those used by habitability measures. As with the definition of the [[habitable zone]], the ESI uses surface temperature as a primary function (and the terrestrial point of reference).  A 2016 article uses ESI as a target selection scheme and obtains results showing that the ESI has little relation to the habitability of an exoplanet, as it takes no account of the [[Flare star|activity of the star]], planetary [[tidal locking]], nor the planet's [[magnetosphere|magnetic field]] (i.e. ability to protect itself) which are among the keys to habitable surface conditions.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The host stars of Kepler's habitable exoplanets: superflares, rotation and activity |author=Armstrong, D. J. |author2=Pugh, C. E. |author3=Broomhall, A.-M. |author4=Brown, D. J. A. |author5=Lund, M. N. |author6=Osborn, H. P. |author7=Pollacco, D.

It has been noted that ESI fails to differentiate between [[Earth]] similarity and [[Venus]] similarity, as can be seen in the table above, where planets with a lower ESI have a greater chance at habitability&lt;ref name="Tasker"&gt;{{cite news|title=No, that new exoplanet is not the best candidate to support life|url=https://theconversation.com/no-that-new-exoplanet-is-not-the-best-candidate-to-support-life-28996|author=Elizabeth Tasker|date=July 9, 2014|publisher=[[The Conversation]]|accessdate=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Planets with an Earth-like size==

[[File:Relative sizes of all of the habitable-zone planets discovered to date alongside Earth.jpg|thumb|Comparison of the sizes of planets [[Kepler-69]]c, [[Kepler-62e]] (0.83), [[Kepler-62f]] (0.69), and the [[Earth]]. All planets except the Earth are artists' conceptions.]] 
The classification of exoplanets is difficult in that many methods of exoplanet detection leave several features unknown. For example, with the [[transit method]], one of the more successful measurement of radius can be highly accurate, but mass and density are often estimated. Likewise with [[radial velocity]] methods, which can provide accurate measurements of mass but are less successful measuring radius. Planets observed via a number of different methods therefore can be most accurately compared to Earth.

==Similarity of non-planets to Earth==

[[File:Io, Earth &amp; Moon size comparison.jpg|thumb|The Moon, Io and Earth shown to scale. Although significantly smaller, some of the Solar System's moons and dwarf planets share similarities to Earth's density and temperature.]]
The index can be calculated for objects other than planets, including [[natural satellite]]s, [[dwarf planet]]s and [[asteroid]]s. The lower average density and temperature of these objects give them lower index values. Only [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] (a moon of Saturn) is known to hold on to a significant atmosphere despite an overall lower size and density. While [[Io (moon)|Io]] (a moon of Jupiter) has a low average temperature, surface temperature on the moon varies wildly due to geologic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=New estimates for Io eruption temperatures: Implications for the interior |journal=Icarus |last=Keszthelyi |first=L. |display-authors=etal |pages=491–502 |volume=192 |issue=2 |date=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2007.07.008 |bibcode=2007Icar..192..491K|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eduardo Reck Miranda''' (born 1963) is a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] [[composer]] of [[chamber music|chamber]] and [[Electroacoustic music|electroacoustic]] pieces but is most notable in the [[United Kingdom]] for his scientific research into computer music, particularly in the field of [[Brain-computer interface|human-machine interfaces]] where [[brain]] waves will replace keyboards and voice commands to permit the [[disabled]] to express themselves musically.&lt;ref name="Eduardo Reck Miranda"&gt;The Living Composers Project. (2002).[http://composers21.com/compdocs/mirandae.htm Eduardo Reck Miranda]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cane, Alan. (April 22, 2005). [[Financial Times|Financial Times UK]]. ''[http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=11685 Mental ways to make music.]'' P.12.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==
===Early life===
Miranda was born in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]]. As one of the largest cities in [[Southern Brazil]] and a cultural, political and economical center, [[Porto Alegre]] had significant influence on Miranda's music.&lt;ref name="Eduardo Reck Miranda"/&gt;

===Education===
In the early 1990s, Miranda attended the [[Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos|University of Vale do Rio dos Sinos]] (UNISINOS) in [[Brazil]] where he received a degree in Data Processing Technology in 1985. Miranda then attended the [[Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul]] (UFRGS) where he studied music composition. Desiring to learn more about music technology and experience more of the world, Miranda made his way to the [[United Kingdom]], where he started his post-graduate research studies at the [[University of York]]. At York, he developed an in-depth study into musical composition using cellular automata. In 1991, he received his [[MSc]] in Music Technology from [[University of York|York]]. After receiving his [[MSc]], Miranda went briefly to Germany to study algorithmic composition at the [[Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie]] in [[Karlsruhe]].

In 1992, Miranda gained admittance to the Faculty of Music of the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]] where he obtained his [[PhD]] in the combined fields of music and artificial intelligence in 1995. For his doctoral thesis, he focused on musical knowledge representation, machine learning of music and software sound synthesis.

===Experiences===
After receiving his [[PhD]], Miranda worked at the [[EPCC|Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre]] (EPCC). At EPCC, he developed Chaosynth, an innovative granular synthesis software that uses cellular automata to generate complex sound spectra.&lt;ref&gt;The Sonic Spot. (2006). ''[http://www.sonicspot.com/chaosynth/chaosynth.html Review of Chaosynth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509174708/http://www.sonicspot.com/chaosynth/chaosynth.html |date=2006-05-09 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, Miranda joined the Department of Music at the [[University of Glasgow]], where he lectured music technology and electroacoustic music composition for a number of years. Then he moved to Paris, to take up a research position at [[Sony]] Computer Science Laboratory in the late 1990s.

At Sony, Miranda conducted research aimed at gaining a better understanding of the fundamental cognitive mechanisms employed in sound-based communication systems. This research led Miranda to focus on the evolution of the human ability to speak and the role of our musical capacity in the development of spoken languages. While at Sony, Miranda filed patents in the field of speech processing and made scientific contributions in the fields of [[speech synthesis]], evolutionary music ([[biomusicology|computational]]) and cognitive neural modeling.

In the early 2000s he was appointed Visiting Professor of Interactive Media Arts at MECAD (School of Media Arts and Design) in Barcelona and Adjunct Associate Professor of Computer Science at the American University of Paris.

In 2003 Miranda moved to the [[University of Plymouth]] in the UK where he presently is a full Professor in Computer Music and Head of the ''[http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/ Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research]'' (ICCMR). He is also an active associate member of the ''[http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/lcm/ Computer Music Lab]'' at the [[Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul]] (UFRGS), in his native town of Porto Alegre.

==Musical compositions==
Miranda's musical compositions have been broadcast and performed in a number of concerts and festivals worldwide, including the Festival Latino-Americano de Arte e Cultura (Brasília, 1987), the Encompor (Porto Alegre, 1988–89, 1995), the International Symposium for Electronic Arts (Minneapolis, 1993), the Festival Elektronischer Frühling (Vienna, 1993–94), and the Ciclo Acusmático (Bogotá, 1995). His music has won prizes and distinctions in Europe and South America, including awards at the Concours International de Musique Électroacoustique de Bourges (1994), the Concurso de Composição de Londrina (Brazil, 1995) and the Concorso Internazionale Luigi Russolo di Musica Elettroacustica (Italy, 1995, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;The October 1996 Ferguson Concert in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]], placed a vivid little string quartet by Eduardo Reck Miranda between music by 16th century composers.

''[http://beehive.thisisplymouth.co.uk/default.asp?WCI=SiteHome&amp;ID=9050&amp;PageID=68542 Ten tors orchestra rise to the challenge.]'' p.. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The University of Plymouth's cultural program included a quartet by Dr Eduardo Reck Miranda, reader in computer music and artificial intelligence at the university's Faculty of Technology. [[Western Morning News]] (UK). (February 23, 2005). ''College showcases computer music.'' p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; A review of his latest solo CD ''Mother Tongue'', in [[The Wire (magazine)|''The Wire'' magazine]], reads, "These are immensely sophisticated pieces that constitute an electronic global music of convincingly organic simplicity."

==Scientific research==
Miranda is an active researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence in Music. He is currently conducting research into neuroscience of music and into simulations of biological natural processes in music origins and evolution. Miranda has turned to artificial life models to coax computers into composing music.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Engineering Times. (January 6, 2003). ''What's Hot: Computers' Tuneful Tinkering is Music to His Ears.'' Issue 1251. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as IBM's Deep Blue showed the world a computer can play chess as well as a human master, Miranda aims to demonstrate a computer program able to compose original music. So far, neural networks have succeeded in imitating distinct musical styles, but truly original compositions have remained elusive. Miranda is tackling this problem with an orchestra of virtual musician agents who interact to compose original music.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, R. Colin. (January 6, 2003). Electronic Engineering Times. ''[http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/publications/pp43EETimes.pdf Harnesses artificial life to evolve original music – Composer scores advance in high-tech tunes.]'' Issue 1251. p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bioinorganic chemistry]], an '''entatic state''' is "a state of an atom or group which, due to its binding in a protein, has its geometric or electronic condition adapted for function."&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef |title=Entatic state |file=ET06763 |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Vallee and Williams,&lt;ref&gt;Vallee BL, Williams RJP (1968) ''Proc Natl Acad Sci USA'' '''59''', 498.&lt;/ref&gt; based on the "rack mechanism" of Malmstrom.&lt;ref name=dft&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles and Applications of Density Functional Theory in Inorganic Chemistry |author1=Nikolas Kaltsoyannis |author2=John E. McGrady |author3=Jochen Autschbach |publisher=Springer |year=2004 |isbn=3-540-21861-0 |pages=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; These states are thought to enhance the chemistry of metal ions in biological catalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms |author1=Perry A Frey |author2=Adrian D Hegeman |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-512258-5 |pages=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an entatic state is the copper center in [[plastocyanin]], a redox enzyme. In this protein, the copper shuttles between oxidized and reduced states, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Each oxidation state prefers a distinct [[coordination geometry]]: whereas copper(II) is normally square planar and prefers [[HSAB|hard bases]] such as oxygen and nitrogen ligands, copper(I) is normally tetrahedral and binds preferentially to soft bases such as sulphur ligands. Because the electron transfer rate depends on the [[reorganization energy]], the ideal rate would be obtained for Cu centers having a geometry intermediate between the requirements of each oxidation state. In fact, the Cu site is neither planar nor tetrahedral it is considered a distorted tetrahedral, with two nitrogen ligands from histidine residues and two sulphur ligands from methionine and cysteine residues, and can therefore be considered an entatic state. Under the entatic state hypothesis, the distortion results from strain caused by binding to ligands with relative orientation that is pre-arranged by the protein.

Some theoretical calculations show that a model system can have a geometry similar to that observed in the protein without any strain; these results, however, remain controversial.&lt;ref name=dft/&gt;

'''Flammability diagrams''' show the control of flammability in mixtures of fuel, [[oxygen]] and an inert gas, typically [[nitrogen]].  Mixtures of the three gasses are usually depicted in a triangular diagram, known as a [[ternary plot]].  Such diagrams are available in the speciality literature.&lt;ref&gt;for instance in [[Michael George Zabetakis]]' 1965 work, which remains one of the most widely cited sources of flammability data.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mashuga 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowl 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The same information can be depicted in a normal orthogonal diagram, showing only two substances, implicitly using the feature that the sum of all three components is 100 percent.  The diagrams below only concerns one fuel; the diagrams can be generalized to mixtures of fuels.

==Understanding flammability diagrams==
Triangular diagrams are not commonplace.  The easiest way to understand them is to briefly go through three basic steps in their construction.  
#Consider the first triangular diagram below, which shows all possible mixtures of methane, oxygen and nitrogen.  [[Air]] is a mixture of about 21 volume percent oxygen, and 79 volume percent inerts (nitrogen). Any mixture of methane and air will therefore lie on the straight line between pure methane and pure air - this is shown as the blue air-line.  The upper and lower [[flammability limits]] of methane in air are located on this line, as shown.
#The [[stoichiometric]] combustion of methane is: CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  The stoichiometric concentration of methane in oxygen is therefore 1/(1+2), which is 33 percent.  Any stoichiometric mixture of methane and oxygen will lie on the straight line between pure nitrogen (and zero percent methane) and 33 percent methane (and 67 percent oxygen) - this is shown as the red stoichiometric line.  The upper and lower [[flammability limits]] of methane in oxygen are located on the methane axis, as shown.
#The actual envelope defining the flammability zone can only be determined based on experiments.  The envelope will pass through the upper and lower [[flammability limits]] of methane in oxygen and in air, as shown.  The nose of the envelope defines the [[limiting oxygen concentration]] (LOC)).

The '''frictionless plane''' is a concept from the writings of [[Galileo Galilei]]. In his 1608 ''[[Two_New_Sciences#Day_3_Naturally_accelerated_motion|The Two New Sciences]]'', Galileo presented a formula that predicted the motion of an object moving down an [[inclined plane]]. His formula was based upon his past experimentation with free-falling bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Stillman, ''Galileo’s Experimental Confirmation of Horizontal Inertia: Unpublished Manuscripts.'' ''Isis'': Vol. 64, No. 3, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his model was not based upon experimentation with objects moving down an inclined plane, but from his conceptual modeling of the forces acting upon the object. Galileo understood the mechanics of the inclined plane as the combination of horizontal and vertical [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]]; the result of [[gravity]] acting upon the object, diverted by the [[slope]] of the plane.&lt;ref&gt;Settle, T. B. "An Experiment in the History of Science", ''Science'', 1061 ''133'' 19–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Galileo's equations do not contemplate [[friction]], and therefore do not perfectly predict the results of an actual [[experiment]]. This is because some energy is always lost when one mass applies a non-zero [[normal force]] to another. Therefore, the observed [[speed]], [[acceleration]] and distance traveled should be less than Galileo predicts.&lt;ref&gt; Jenkin, Fleeming. ''On Friction Between Surfaces at Low Speeds.'' Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 26 p. 93–94 &lt;/ref&gt; This energy is lost in forms like sound and heat. However, from Galileo's predictions of an object moving down an inclined plane in a frictionless environment, he created the theoretical foundation for extremely fruitful real-world experimental prediction.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, at p. 297–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Frictionless planes do not exist in the real world. However, if they did, one can be almost certain that objects on them would behave exactly as Galileo predicts. Despite their nonexistence, they have considerable value in the design of engines, motors, roadways, and even tow-truck beds, to name a few examples.&lt;ref&gt; Koyré, Alexandre ''Metaphysics and Measurement'', pp. 83–84 (1992). &lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of friction on an object moving down an inclined plane can be calculated as

:&lt;math&gt; F_\mathrm{f} = \mu_\mathrm{k} F_\mathrm{N}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; F_\mathrm{f} &lt;/math&gt; is the force of friction exerted by the object and the inclined plane on each other, parallel to the surface of the plane, &lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[normal force]] exerted by the object and the plane on each other, directed perpendicular to the plane, and &lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of [[Friction#Kinetic_friction|kinetic friction]].&lt;ref&gt; Koyré, pp. 84–86. &lt;/ref&gt;

Unless the inclined plane is in a [[vacuum]], a (usually) small amount of [[potential energy]] is also lost to [[air drag]].

A '''funeral oration''' or '''''epitaphios logos''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|ἐπιτάφιος λόγος}}) is a formal speech delivered on the ceremonial occasion of a [[funeral]]. Funerary customs comprise the practices used by a culture to remember the dead, from the funeral itself, to various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in their honour. In [[ancient Greece]] and, in particular, in  [[ancient Athens]], the funeral oration was deemed an indispensable component of the funeral ritual.

The ''epitaphios logos'' is regarded as an almost exclusive Athenian creation, although some early elements of such speeches exist in the [[epic poetry|epos]] of Homer and in the [[Lyric poetry|lyric poems]] of [[Pindar]]. [[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] is the earlier extant of the genre.&lt;ref name="Colaiaco"&gt;J.A. Colaiaco, ''Socrates Against Athens'', 75&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians are those who set the standard and, therefore, [[Demosthenes]] praises them, saying that "you alone of all mankind publicly pronounce over your dead funeral orations, in which you extol the deeds of the brave".&lt;ref name="Leptines"&gt;Demosthenes, ''Against Leptines'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0072&amp;layout=&amp;loc=20.141 141]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homer and Pindar==
In Homer very few elements of ''epitaphios logos'' or laudation are found. At the funeral of [[Patroclus]] chief in all the mourning is [[Achilles]]; the son of [[Peleus]] laid his bloodstained hand on the breast of his friend and cried, "Fare well Patroklos, even in the house of [[Hades]]. I will now do all that I erewhile promised you; I will drag [[Hector]] hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve noble sons of Trojans will I also slay before your pyre to avenge you."&lt;ref name="HomerIl19"&gt;Homer, ''The Iliad'', 23, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0217&amp;query=book%3D%2323 19 etc.]&lt;/ref&gt; As he spoke he treated the body of Hector with contumely, laying it at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroklos.&lt;ref name="HomerIl19" /&gt; At the funeral of Hector the women, [[Andromache]], his mother and Helen, deliver the final public statements over the dead body.&lt;ref name="Foley40"&gt;H. P. Foley, ''Female Acts in Greek Tragedy'', 40&lt;/ref&gt; Andromache laments the loss of her husband with these emotional words:&lt;ref name="HomerIl477"&gt;Homer, ''The Iliad'', 22, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0217&amp;layout=&amp;loc=22.477 477 etc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Woe is me, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share a common lot we were born, you at Troy in the house of Priam, and I at Thebes under the wooded mountain of Plakos in the house of Eetion who brought me up when I was a child - ill-starred sire of an ill-starred daughter - would that he had never begotten me. You are now going into the house of Hades under the secret places of the earth, and you leave me a sorrowing widow in your house. The child, of whom you and I are the unhappy parents, is as yet a mere infant. Now that you are gone, O Hector, you can do nothing for him nor he for you.}}

In the ''Sixth Olympian For Hagesias of Syracuse'', the poet mentions a characteristic example of an [[epitaph]] high praise: "Hagesias, that praise is ready for you, which once Adrastus' tongue rightly spoke for the seer Amphiaraus, son of Oicles, when the earth swallowed up him and his shining horses.  In Thebes, when the seven pyres of corpses had been consumed, the son of Talaus spoke in this way: “I long for the eye of my army, a man who was good both as a prophet and at fighting with the spear.”"&lt;ref name="Pindar"&gt;Pindar, ''Sixth Olympian'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162&amp;layout=&amp;loc=O.+6.1  15]&lt;/ref&gt; Nicole Loraux observes that the ''epitaphios'' was "born of lyric poetry and in competition with it", since the funeral oratory "uses poetic themes but reinterprets them from a resolutely political perspective".&lt;ref name="Loraux231"&gt;N. Loraux, ''The Invention of Athens'', 231&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athens==
The orator [[Anaximenes of Lampsacus]] claimed that the funeral oration had been originated in the 6th-century BC in Athens by [[Solon]],&lt;ref&gt;Anaximenes, ''Frag.'' 44&lt;/ref&gt; but this is widely doubted by historians.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Sickinger, 1999, ''Public records and archives in classical Athens'', page 30. UNC Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usher"&gt;Stephen Usher, 1999, ''Greek oratory: tradition and originality'', page 349. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; More plausible, but not beyond doubt,&lt;ref name="usher"/&gt; is the statement by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] that the Athenians instituted the funeral oration "in honour or those who fought at [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], and died for their country, or to the glory of their exploits at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]]."&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ''Ant. Rom.'' v. 17. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Thucydides describes in detail the funeral rituals and points out that "the dead are laid in the public sepulchre in the most beautiful suburb of the city, in which those who fall in war are always buried".&lt;ref name="Th2.34"&gt;Thucydides, ''The Peloponnesian War'', 2.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&amp;layout=&amp;loc=2.34.1 34]&lt;/ref&gt; This suburb was [[Kerameikos]], where there was a monument for all the Athenians fell in battle, except such of them as fought at Marathon.&lt;ref name="Pausanias"&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'', 29.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.29.1 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians now believe that the ''demosion sema'' (a collective burial site for the war dead) and the ''epitaphios logos'' were first established around 470 BC, customs that continued during the Periclean period.&lt;ref name="N95-96"&gt;A.W. Nightingale, ''Genres in Dialogues'', 95-96&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest preserved casualty list, giving the names of those who died fighting for their city in a given year, dates to 490-480 BC and it is associated with the [[battle of Marathon]],&lt;ref&gt;Keesling, C., The Marathon Casualty List from Eua-Loukou and the Plinthedon Style in Attic Inscriptions, Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, vol. 180 (2012), pp. 139-148&lt;/ref&gt; and white-ground [[lekythos|lekythoi]] depicting funerary scenes started around 470 BC.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Oakley, ''Bail Oinochoai'', 13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pericles' Funeral Oration|funeral oration]] of [[Pericles]], as reported by [[Thucydides]], is the earliest ''epitaphios'' presented in full.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, II, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0199;query=chapter%3D%23181;layout=;loc=2.36.1/ 35-46]&lt;/ref&gt; The burial of the war dead in the first year of the [[Peloponnesian War]] is regarded as reflecting the fifth-century dominance of the public co-memorial.&lt;ref&gt;K. Derderian, ''Leaving Words to Remember'', 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheme and structure==

Though [[Plato]] is consistently suspicious of the ability of oratory to teach, in the ''[[Menexenus (dialogue)|Menexenus]]'' he demonstrates a theoretical interest in the project of funeral oratory.&lt;ref name="Monoson202"&gt;S. Monoson, ''Plato's Democratic Entanglements'', 202&lt;/ref&gt; He actually describes the scheme of the traditional Athenian funeral oration with the following succinct phrase:&lt;ref name="Menexenus236e"&gt;Plato, ''Menexenus'', 236 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180&amp;layout=&amp;loc=Menex.+236e e]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|And the speech required is one which will adequately eulogize the dead and give kindly exhortation to the living, appealing to their children and their brethren to copy the virtues of these heroes, and to their fathers and mothers and any still surviving ancestors offering consolation.}}

Thereby, the traditional ''epitaphios'' must contain: a ''[[eulogy]]'' of the war dead and the city, an ''exhortation'' to the relatives to copy the virtues of the war dead and a ''consolation'' for the living members of their families.&lt;ref name="Helios"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Funeral Oration|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia The Helios]]|year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the ''epitaphios'' consists of the following parts:
* ''Preamble'', which treats the performance expectations of the audience.&lt;ref name="Derderian181"&gt;K. Derderian, ''Leaving Words to Remember'', 181&lt;/ref&gt; The orator usually asserts that it is almost impossible for him to find words worthy of the glorious achievements of the war dead.&lt;ref name="Helios" /&gt; Such a preamble reveals the position of the ''epitaphios'' as an oral genre within a ritually and socially bounded society.&lt;ref name="Derderian181" /&gt;
*''Origin and ancestors''.
*''The war dead, their self-sacrifice and their devotion to the Athenian Polity''.
*''Epilogue'', which constitutes a consolation and an encouragement for the families of the war dead.&lt;ref name="Helios" /&gt; The epilogue employs a traditional dismissal of the mourners for further private lament, at which point the city's promise of education for the surviving orphans signals the resumption of life in the ''polis''.&lt;ref name="Derderian181" /&gt;

== Function and critics ==

The primary function of the funeral oration was to give public expression to the conception of the potential excellence of [[polis]]. It was an occasion on which Athens "invented" and "reinvented" itself in narrative form.&lt;ref name="Loraux312"&gt;N. Loraux, ''The Invention of Athens'', 312&lt;/ref&gt; The city displayed its achievements, as well as the civic and personal virtues to which the citizens could aspire.&lt;ref name="Monoson202" /&gt; The secular prose of the funeral oration dedicates itself to celebrating the ideal of the democratic Athenian city.&lt;ref&gt;N. Loraux, ''The Children of Athena'', 45&lt;/ref&gt; Through the ''epitaphios'', a civic discourse, the city recognizes itself as it wishes to be.&lt;ref name="Loraux312" /&gt;

It is for this reason that Plato has chosen the funeral oration as a main target of him. In ''Menexenus'' he engages the concerns of funeral oratory and appropriates for philosophy part of the intellectual mission that the Athenians associated with the most celebrated and democratic form of [[epideictic]], the funeral oratory.&lt;ref name="Monoson205"&gt;S. Monoson, ''Plato's Democratic Entanglements'', 205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extant speeches==

Whereas the ''epitaphios'' originated itself as a public speech composed for a specific occasion, a number of specimens of this genre were not composed for delivery at the public burial. They would have been read to small audiences at the intellectual gatherings that met at so many venues. Gorgias' funeral oration, maybe that of [[Lysias]] and clearly Plato's parodic ''epitaphios'' in ''Menexenus'' were not designed to be delivered before the Athenian people.&lt;ref name="N95-96" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6535">As defined by [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], '''geo-literacy''' is "the ability to use [[geographic]] understanding and geographic reasoning to make decisions".&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/geoliteracy/?ar_a=1&amp;force_AR=True |title=Geo-Literacy |accessdate=June 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416071705/http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/geoliteracy/?ar_a=1&amp;force_AR=True |archivedate=April 16, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "geo-literacy" arose from the National Geographic Society's "Fight against Geographic Illiteracy." The organization released various media to help explain the concept to the general public. In an editorial, Daniel C. Edelson, vice president for education at National Geographic, said, "The National Geographic Society's concern for geo-literacy comes from our mission. We see geo-literacy as providing the tools that will enable communities to protect [[natural resource|natural]] and cultural resources, reduce violent [[Armed conflict|conflict]], and improve the [[quality of life]] worldwide. However, having a geo-literate populace is also critical for maintaining [[Competition (economics)|economic competitiveness]], quality of life, and national security in our modern, interconnected world.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://geography.about.com/b/2012/05/13/geo-literacy.htm | title=Geo-Literacy | publisher=About.com | date=May 13, 2012 | accessdate=June 26, 2012 | author=Rosenberg, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have released various media to help explain it to the general public.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"/&gt; In addition, the National Geographic Society set up the Fund for Geo-literacy, in which donations help fund the printing of materials for education, professional development for the educators, and programs to help build awareness of the importance of geo-literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/program/fund-for-geo-literacy/?ar_a=1&amp;force_AR=True |title=Fund for Geo-Literacy |accessdate=June 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625130105/http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/program/fund-for-geo-literacy/?ar_a=1 |archivedate=June 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
According to Edelson, the 3 components of geo-literacy are:&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"/&gt;
* Interactions-Understanding of human and natural systems
* Interconnections-Geographic reasoning
* Implications-Systematic decision-making

==Educational activities==
"Kid World Citizen", a site which provides "multicultural, educational activities to teach...kids about the world", and who, listed the following "age-appropriate lessons to increase geo-literacy in primary school students":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kidworldcitizen.org/2012/05/13/what-is-geo-literacy/ | title=What is Geo-Literacy? | publisher=Kid World Citizen | date=May 13, 2012 | accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Explore different homes around the world and guess why the types of home fit their environment
* Discover why certain cultures celebrate certain holidays, and what is important to them
* Investigate different [[habitats]] and [[biomes]], such as the [[rainforest]]; look at tangible ways kids can prevent their destruction
* Surround kids with geography: study maps, [[cartography|create maps]], follow maps, play with maps. The more you develop their spatial intelligence when they’re younger, the more kids will understand their place in this world.
* Learn about the [[water cycle]] and the conserving and managing our freshwater resources
* Research your child’s favorite animal, turning it into a global lesson about protecting their habitat and food sources; what decisions can we make that will affect the outcome of this animal?

==Research Studies and Education Projects==
In 2012, InTeGrate ("a community effort to improve geoscience literacy and build a workforce that can make use of geoscience to solve societal issues") held a Module Author Meeting from May 16–18 on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://serc.carleton.edu/integrate/info_team_members/meetings/geo_lit_agenda.html | title=Module Author Meeting Agenda | accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier Uses of the Term "geo-literacy"==

In 2002, Robert E. Nolan of the [[Education Resources Information Center]] published a research report/journal article entitled "Geo-Literacy: How Well Adults Understand the World in Which They Live", which included  "a test of physical and geopolitical geography...completed by 321 adults". The years of formal education and age were correlated with geographic literacy, and informal learning, such as travel, reading, media, was used as the primary source of geographic knowledge for those with higher educational attainment. A notable finding was that women, regardless of education level, scored significantly lower than men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ658647&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ658647 | title=Geo-Literacy: How Well Adults Understand the World in Which They Live | accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[Arizona Geographic Information Council|Arizona Geographic Alliance]] launched a project called "The GeoLiteracy Project" that integrated geography education into reading and writing instruction.  In this case, their term "GeoLiteracy" referred to the integration of geography and traditional language arts literacy. 

In 1997, Linda Ferguson and Eva LaMar established an educational project they called "The Geo-Literacy Project".  LaMar describes geo-literacy as "the use of visual learning and communication tools to build an in-depth understanding -- or literacy -- of geography, [[geology]], and local [[history]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=Ashley|title=Geo-Literacy: Using Technology to Forge New Ground|url=http://www.edutopia.org/geo-literacy-forging-new-ground|work=Edutopia|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''ideal observer'' is a theoretical system that performs a specific task in an optimal way.  If there is uncertainty in the task, then perfect performance is impossible and the ideal observer will make errors.

''Ideal performance'' is the theoretical upper limit of performance.  It is theoretically impossible for a real system to perform better than ideal.  Typically, real systems are only capable of sub-ideal performance.

This technique is useful for analyzing psychophysical data (see [[psychophysics]]).

==Definition==

Many definitions of this term have been offered.

'''Geisler (2003)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Visual Neurosciences |chapter=Ideal Observer Analysis |last=Geisler |first=Wilson S. |editor1-first=Leo M. |editor1-last=Chalupa |editor2-first=John S. |editor2-last=Werner |year=2003 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location= |isbn= 9780262033084|pages=825–837 |accessdate=August 19, 2012 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=AN-sdYjcyvAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Visual+Neurosciences#v=onepage&amp;q=Ideal%20Observer%20analysis&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; (slightly reworded):  The central concept in ideal observer analysis is the ''ideal observer'', a theoretical device that performs a given task in an optimal fashion given the available information and some specified constraints.  This is not to say that ideal observers perform without error, but rather that they perform at the physical limit of what is possible in the situation.  The fundamental role of uncertainty and noise implies that ideal observers must be defined in probabilistic (statistical) terms.  ''Ideal observer analysis'' involves determining the performance of the ideal observer in a given task and then comparing its performance to that of a real [[perceptual system]], which (depending on the application) might be the system as a whole, a subsystem, or an elementary component of the system (e.g. a neuron).

Geisler |year=1989 |title=Sequential ideal-observer analysis of visual discriminations |journal=[[Psychological Review]] |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=267–314 |doi= 10.1037/0033-295x.96.2.267|pmc= |pmid=2652171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the goal is to measure a real system's performance deficit (relative to ideal) at different processing stages.  Such an approach is useful when studying systems that process information in discrete (or semi-discrete) stages or modules.

==Natural and pseudo-natural tasks==

To facilitate experimental design in the laboratory, an artificial task may be designed so that the system's performance in the task may be studied.  If the task is too artificial, the system may be pushed away from a natural mode of operation.  Depending on the goals of the experiment, this may diminish its [[external validity]].

In such cases, it may be important to keep the system operating naturally (or almost naturally) by designing a pseudo-natural task.  Such tasks are still artificial, but they attempt to mimic the natural demands placed on a system.  For example, the task might employ stimuli that resemble natural [[scene (perception)|scenes]] and might test the system's ability to make potentially useful judgments about these stimuli.

[[Scene statistics|Natural scene statistics]] are the basis for calculating ideal performance in natural and pseudo-natural tasks.  This calculation tends to incorporate elements of [[Detection theory|signal detection theory]], [[information theory]], or [[estimation theory]].

An '''in-service program''' is a professional training or staff development effort, where professionals are trained and discuss their work with others in their peer group.

It is a key component of [[continuing medical education]] for [[physician]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, and other medical professionals. It is also common among public servants including educators&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wsaw.com/news/education/headlines/104310863.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and public safety officials.

In-service program also refers to some programs offered to enlisted members of the [[military]] while they are in service.

In-service programs also refers to [[educator]]s, where they discuss methods and cases and work loads.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grew out of the Statistical Laboratory set up by [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis]] in [[Presidency College, Kolkata]]. Established in 1931, this [[public university]] of India is one of the oldest and most prestigious institutions focused on statistics, and its early reputation led it to being adopted as a model for the first US institute of Statistics set up at the [[Research Triangle]], [[North Carolina]] by [[Gertrude Mary Cox]].&lt;ref name=cox&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahalanobis, the founder of ISI, was deeply influenced by wisdom and guidance of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Brajendranath Seal]]. Under his leadership, the institute initiated and promoted the interaction of Statistics with natural and social sciences to advance the role of Statistics as a key technology by explicating the twin aspects{{spaced ndash}}its general applicability and its dependence on other disciplines for its own development. The institute is now considered as one of the foremost centres in the world for training and research in Computer science, Statistics, Quantitative Economics and related sciences.

ISI has its headquarters in [[Baranagar]], [[Kolkata, West Bengal]]. It has four subsidiary centres focused in academics at [[Delhi]], [[Bangalore]], [[Chennai]] and [[Tezpur]], and a branch at [[Giridih]]. In addition, the Institute has a network of units of [[Statistical Process Control|Statistical Quality Control]] and [[Operations Research]] at [[Vadodara]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Pune]] engaged in guiding the industries, within and outside India, in developing the most up–to–date quality management systems and solving critical problems of quality, reliability and productivity.

Primary activities of ISI are research and training of Statistics, development of theoretical Statistics and its applications in various natural and social sciences. Originally affiliated with the [[University of Calcutta]], the institute was declared an institute of national importance in 1959, through an act of Indian parliament, Indian Statistical Institute act, 1959. ISI functions under the [[Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (India)|Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation]] (MOSPI) of the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref name=mospi&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 19 November 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key areas of expertise of ISI are  [[Computer science]], Statistics, [[Mathematics]], [[Mathematical economics]], [[Operations Research]] and [[Information Science]] and it is one of the few research oriented Indian schools offering courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level.

== History ==
ISI's origin can be traced back to the Statistical Laboratory in [[Presidency College, Kolkata]] set up by Mahalanobis, who worked in the Physics Department of the college in the 1920s. During 1913–15, he did his [[Tripos]] in Mathematics and Physics at [[University of Cambridge]],&lt;ref name=hist1013&gt;{{harvnb|Ghosh|Maiti|Bera|2010|p=1013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he came across ''[[Biometrika]]'', a journal of Statistics founded by [[Karl Pearson]].&lt;ref name=hist1019&gt;{{harvnb|Ghosh|Maiti|Bera|2010|p=1019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1915, he taught Physics at Presidency College,&lt;ref name=hist1013/&gt; but his interest in Statistics grew under the guidance of [[polymath]] [[Brajendranath Seal]].&lt;ref name=hist1019/&gt; Many colleagues of Mahalanobis took an interest in Statistics and the group grew in the Statistical Laboratory. Considering the extensive application of Statistics in solving various problems in real life such as analyzing multivariate anthropometric data, applying sample surveys as a method of data collection, analyzing meteorological data, estimating crop yield etc., this group, particularly, Mahalanobis and his younger colleagues [[Subhendu Sekhar Bose|S. S. Bose]] and [[Harish Chandra Sinha|H. C. Sinha]] felt the necessity of forming a specialized institute to facilitate research and learning of Statistics.&lt;ref name=evoln22&gt;{{harvnb|Ghosh|Maiti|Rao|Sinha|1999|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 1931, Mahalonobis held a meeting with Pramatha Nath Banerji (Minto Professor of Economics), Nikhil Ranjan Sen (Khaira Professor of Applied Mathematics) and Sir [[R. N. Mukherji]].&lt;ref name=evoln22/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite book | first = C. R | last = Rao | authorlink = Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao | year = 1973 | title = Prasantha Chandra Mahalanobis. 1893–1972 | publisher = ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society''| volume = 19 | pages=454–492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite book | last = Rudra | first = A | year = 1996 | title = ''Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis: A Biography'' | publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meeting led to the establishment of the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), which was formally registered on 28 April 1932, as a non-profit distributing learned society under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Later, the institute was registered under the West Bengal Societies Registration Act XXVI of 1961 amended in 1964.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isical.ac.in/history.php|title=History of ISI|publisher=Indian Statistical Institute|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mukherjee accepted the role of the president of ISI and held this position until his death in 1936.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; In 1953,&lt;ref name=hist1020&gt;{{harvnb|Ghosh|Maiti|Bera|2010|p=1020}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISI was relocated to a property owned by Professor Mahalanobis, named "Amrapali", in [[Baranagar]], which is now a municipality at the northern outskirts of Kolkata.

In 1931, Mahalanobis was the only person working at ISI, and he managed it with an annual expenditure of Rs.250. It gradually grew with the pioneering work of a group of his colleagues including S. S. Bose, [[Samarendra Kumar Mitra]] (Head of the Computing Machines and Electronics Laboratory and designer of India's first computer), [[J. M. Sengupta]], [[Raj Chandra Bose]], [[Samarendra Nath Roy]], [[K. R. Nair]], [[R. R. Bahadur]], [[Gopinath Kallianpur]], [[D. B. Lahiri]], and [[Anil Kumar Gain]]. [[Pitamber Pant]], who had received training in Statistics at the institute, went on to become a secretary to the first Prime Minister of India, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], and was a great source of help and support to the institute.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

The institute started a training section in 1938. In due course, many of the early workers left the ISI for careers in the USA or for positions in public/private sector in India. By the 1940s, the ISI was internationally known and was taken as a model when the first institute of Statistics was set up in the United States by Gertrude Cox{{spaced ndash}}perhaps the only time an institute in a developing country was used as a model in a developed country.&lt;ref name=cox/&gt;

As asked by the Government of India, in 1950, ISI designed and planned a comprehensive socio–economic national sample survey covering rural India. The organisation named National Sample Survey (NSS) was founded in 1950 for conducting this survey.&lt;ref name=evoln1718&gt;{{harvnb|Ghosh|Maiti|Rao|Sinha|1999|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field work was performed by the Directorate of NSS,  functioning under the [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]], whereas the other tasks such as planning of the survey, training of field workers, review, data processing and tabulation were executed by ISI.&lt;ref name=evoln1718/&gt; In 1961, the Directorate of NSS started functioning under the [[Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (India)#Department of Statistics|Department of Statistics]] of Government of India, and later in 1971, the design and analysis wing of NSS was shifted from ISI to the Department of Statistics forming the [[National Sample Survey Organisation]] (NSSO).&lt;ref name=evoln1718/&gt;

[[J. B. S. Haldane]] joined the ISI as a research professor from August 1957, and stayed on until February 1961, when he had a falling out with ISI Director P.C. Mahalanobis over Haldane's going on a much-publicized hunger strike to protest the United States pressuring U.S. National Science Fair winners [[Gary Botting]] and Susan Brown from attending an ISI banquet to which many prominent Indian scientists had been invited.&lt;ref&gt;"Haldane on Fast: Insult by USIS Alleged," ''Times of India'', 19 January 1961; "Protest Fast by Haldane: USIS’s Anti-Indian Activities," ''Times of India'', 18 January 1961; "Situation was Misunderstood, Scholars Explain," ''Times of India'', 20 January 1961;  "USIS Explanation does not satisfy Haldane: Protest fast continues," ''Times of India'', 18 January 1960; "USIS Claim Rejected by Haldane: Protest Fast to Continue," ''Times of India'', 18 January 1961; "Haldane Not Satisfied with USIS Apology: Fast to Continue," Free Press Journal, 18 January 1961; "Haldane Goes on Fast In Protest Against U.S. Attitude," ''Times of India'', 18 January 1961; "Haldane to continue fast: USIS explanation unsatisfactory," ''Times of India'', 19 January 1961; "Local boy in hunger strike row," ''Toronto Star'', 20 January 1961; "Haldane, Still on Fast, Loses Weight: U.S.I.S.

Until 1959, ISI was associated with the [[University of Calcutta]]. By 'The Indian Statistical Institute Act 1959' of the Parliament of India, amended in 1995, ISI was declared an institute of national importance,&lt;ref name=unsd/&gt; and was authorised to hold examinations and to grant degrees and diplomas in Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative Economics, and in any other subject related to Statistics as identified by the Institute from time to time.&lt;ref name=unsd/&gt; ISI is a [[public university]], as the same act also states that ISI would be funded by the Central Government of India.&lt;ref name=unsd/&gt;

ISI had by the 1960s started establishing special service units in New Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai and Hyderabad to provide consultancy services to business, industry and governmental public service organisations in the areas of Statistical Process Control, Operations Research and Industrial Engineering. Additionally, Bangalore had a [[Documentation Research and Training Centre]] (DRTC). In the early 1970s, the Delhi and Bangalore units were converted to teaching centres. In 2008, ISI Chennai was upgraded to a teaching centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Objectives ==
The major objectives of the ISI are&lt;ref name=obj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isical.ac.in/objectives.php|title=Welcome to Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata|website=www.isical.ac.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; to facilitate research and training of Statistics, to indulge in development of statistical theory and in application of statistical techniques{{spaced ndash}}in the scenarios of planning at national level and in theoretical development of natural and social sciences, to participate in the process of data collection and analysis, to operate related projects in planning and improvement of efficiency of management and production.

The Sanskrit phrase भिन्नेष्वैक्यस्य दर्शणम् (Bhinneswaykyasya Darshanam), which literally means the philosophy of unity in diversity, is incorporated in the logo of the institute, and is the motto of ISI.&lt;ref name=obj/&gt;

Traditionally, ISI offers fewer programs (and admits fewer students) than most other degree granting academic institutions. Following the empowerment for granting degrees in the subject of Statistics as per the ISI Act 1959, in 1960, ISI initiated bachelor level degree program Bachelor of Statistics and master level degree course Master of Statistics, and also began awarding research level degrees such as PhD and DSc.&lt;ref name=sbrao/&gt; Later, ISI started offering Master of Technology (MTech) courses in Computer Science and in Quality, Reliability &amp; Operations Research (QR&amp;OR); these courses got recognition from [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE).&lt;ref name=sbrao/&gt; As ISI Act of 1959 was amended by the Parliament of India in 1995, ISI was empowered to confer degrees and diplomas in subjects such as Mathematics, Quantitative Economics, Computer Science, and other subjects related to Statistics and Operations Research as determined by ISI from time to time.&lt;ref name=sbrao/&gt; Apart from the degree courses, ISI offers few diploma and certificate courses, special diploma courses for international students via ISEC, and special courses in collaboration with [[Central Statistical Organisation|CSO]] for training probationary officers of [[Indian Statistical Service]] (ISS).&lt;ref name=isiprospectus&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.isical.ac.in/~deanweb/GENPRSP2K12.pdf | format = PDF | title = Prospectus, 2012–13 | publisher = Indian Statistical Institute | accessdate = 1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Degree courses ===
ISI offers two undergraduate programs, viz. Bachelor of Statistics (Honours) (B.Stat) and Bachelor of Mathematics (Honours) (B. Math),&lt;ref name=prog&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.isical.ac.in/academicprogramme.php |title = Academic Programme |publisher = Indian Statistical Institute |accessdate = 2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; seven graduate programs, viz. Master of Statistics (M. Stat), Master of Mathematics (M. Math), Master of Science in Quantitative Economics (MSQE), Master of Science in Library and Information Science (MSLIS), Master of Science in Quality Management Science (MSQMS), Master of Technology in Computer Science (MTech–CS) and Master of Technology in Quality, Reliability and Operations Research (MTech–QROR),&lt;ref name=prog/&gt; three PG Diploma programs, viz Post Graduate Diploma in Computer Applications (PGDCA)&lt;ref name=pgdca&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.isical.ac.in/~placement/assets/docs/PGDCASyllabus.pdf |title = PGDCA Programme |publisher = Indian Statistical Institute |accessdate = 2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and P.G. Diploma in Statistical Methods and Analytics and  research fellowships towards obtaining a PhD degree.&lt;ref name=prog/&gt; The third PG diploma program being in collaboration with [[IIM Calcutta]] and [[IIT Kharagpur]] -  Post Graduate Diploma in Business Analytics (PGDBA)&lt;ref name=pgdba&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.isical.ac.in/~pgdba }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an aim to nurture and develop highly skilled business analytical professionals.

Undergraduate courses are of 3 years duration, whereas the graduate level courses of 2 years of duration. For all undergraduate and graduate level courses, the academic year is divided in two semesters.&lt;ref name=isiprospectus/&gt; Except for sponsored candidates of MTech courses, ISI students are not required to pay any tuition fees.&lt;ref name=isiprospectus/&gt; Conditional to performance beyond a threshold, all students and research fellows receive stipends, fellowships and contingency/book grants.&lt;ref name=isiprospectus/&gt; Students demonstrating outstanding performances are rewarded at the end of the semesters.&lt;ref name=isiprospectus/&gt; ISI campuses provide hostel accommodations with recreational facilities and limited medical facilities available free of cost.&lt;ref name=isiprospectus/&gt;

=== Admissions ===

[[Anil Kumar Gain]] is known for his contributions to the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] with his colleague Sir [[Ronald Fisher]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=hist1023/&gt;

In 1953, India's first indigenous computer was designed by Samarendra Kumar Mitra who headed the Computing Machines and Electronics Laboratory at ISI Calcutta. The Indian Statistical Institute was also hosted the first two digital computers in South Asia; the HEC-2M from England in 1956, and the URAL from the Soviet Union in 1959. These were also among the earliest digital computers in Asia (outside Japan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Menon|first=Nikhil|date=2018|title=‘Fancy Calculating Machine’: Computers and planning in independent India|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-asian-studies/article/fancy-calculating-machine-computers-and-planning-in-independent-india/AE97E3E18914EDF1378E29CAE1579BB2|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=52|pages=421–457|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1953 - 1956 distinguished scientists, like [[Ronald Fisher]], [[Norbert Wiener]] and [[Yuri Linnik]] visited ISI. [[Norbert Wiener]] collaborated with [[Gopinath Kallianpur]] on topics including [[ergodic theory]], [[prediction theory]] and generalized [[harmonic analysis]].&lt;ref name="Norbert Wiener"&gt;{{cite web|title=Norbert Wiener and Probability Theory|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Jan1999/pdf/Jan1999p32-34.pdf|publisher=[[Indian Academy of Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, during his month-long visit to ISI, Soviet mathematician [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] wrote his notable paper on [[Kolmogorov complexity]], which was published in Sankhya, 1963.&lt;ref name=hist103132&gt;{{harvnb|Ghosh|Maiti|Bera|2010|pp=1031–1032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other distinguished scientists including [[Jerzy Neyman]], [[Walter A.

=== Planning Commission ===
The [[Five-Year plans of India#Second Five-Year Plan .(1956.–.1961)|second five-year plan of India]] was a brainchild of Mahalanobis. The plan followed the [[Mahalanobis model]], an [[economic development]] model developed by Mahalanobis in 1953. The plan attempted to determine the optimal allocation of investment between productive sectors in order to maximise long-run economic growth . It used the prevalent state of art techniques of operations research and optimisation as well as the novel applications of statistical models developed at ISI. This second five-year plan shifted the focus from agriculture to industrialisation, with an objective of attaining self-reliance by economy of India. Domestic production of industrial products was encouraged in this plan, particularly in the development of the [[public sector]].&lt;ref name=Das88&gt;{{cite book

=== Social sciences ===
R. L. Brahmachari, known for his work in many fields like agricultural sciences, zoology, botany, biometrics, did much of his work at ISI.

The institute has done some pioneering work and research in anthropology and palaeontology. A trove of dinosaur fossils was discovered by a team led by ISI researchers in the early 1960s. The scattered fossils were recovered and the partial skeleton was reconstructed at ISI's Baranagar campus. It turned out to be a unique species and was named the ''[[Barapasaurus tagorei (Dinosauria: Sauropoda)]]'', after Rabindranath Tagore and was mounted in the Geology Museum at the Kolkata Campus of the Institute.

The Linguistic Research Unit (LRU) of ISI was involved in the study of speech pathology. [[Đorđe Kostić]] of this laboratory was a distinguished scientist. He invented a unique hearing aid, called SAFA (Selective Auditory Frequency Amplifier) that simulates frequency-range according to the need of the particular hearing impaired person.&lt;ref name=kostic&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.serbian-corpus.edu.rs/ns/history/djk2/djko.htm | title = Đorđe Kostić | publisher = Institute for Experimental Phonetics and Speech Pathology, Belgrade | accessdate = 30 November 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140928220142/http://www.serbian-corpus.edu.rs/ns/history/djk2/djko.htm | archivedate = 28 September 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kolkata campus ===
[[File:Isical01.jpg|thumb|300 px|Main Building of Indian Statistical Institute, [[Kolkata]]]]
ISI Kolkata has a campus consisting of six addresses at 201 through 206 [[Barrackpore Trunk Road]], [[Baranagar]]. These include a house, which was an erstwhile office of the [[National Sample Survey Organisation]] (NSSO) of India.

ISI Kolkata campus is eco-friendly, as conceived by Mahalanobis. Hollow bricks that protect from heat and noise were used with minimum use of reinforced concrete, to avoid radiation. There was no use of bitumen-basalt combination at the roads inside ISI campuses. This helps in reduction of radiation and preservation of rain water to maintain equilibrium in ground-water level.

The Kolkata campus offers bachelors level degree course in Statistics (B. Stat), master's degree course in Statistics (M.Stat), Mathematics (M.Math), Computer Science (MTech), Quality Reliability and Operations Research (MTech) and Quantitative Economics (M.S.).&lt;ref name=prog/&gt; Major divisions and units are: Statistics and Mathematics Unit (SMU), Human Genetics Unit (HGU), Physics and Applied Mathematics Unit (PAMU), Geological Studies Unit (GSU), Advanced Computation and MicroElectronics Unit (ACMU), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Unit (CVPRU), Machine Intelligence Unit (MIU), Electronics and Communication Sciences Unit (ECSU), Applied Statistics Unit (ASU), Economic Research Unit (ERU), Linguistic Research Unit (LRU), Sociology Research Unit (SRU), Psychometry Research Unit (PRU) and Population Studies Unit (PSU).

The Kolkata campus houses the International Statistical Education Centre (ISEC), which opened in 1950. This Centre provides training in statistics to sponsored students mainly from the Middle East, South and South East Asia, the Far East and the Commonwealth Countries of Africa. The Centre also offers various short-term courses in statistics and related subjects.

The Center for Soft Computing Research: A National Facility, an associate institute of Indian Statistical Institute and established in Kolkata in 2005, is unique in the country. Apart from conducting basic research, it offers a 3-month course and promotes less endowed institutes by providing fellowships and research grants.

The Central Library of ISI is located at Kolkata with branches at the other facilities. The library has over 200,000 volumes of books and journals with a special emphasis on the field of statistics and related studies. The main branch also has a collection of official reports, reprints, maps, and microfilms. The library receives over a thousand new technical and scientific journals every year. The Library has databases on CD-ROM and is working on further digitization of the collection. The library has a separate collection of works on the topics of mathematics and statistics called the Eastern Regional Centre of [[National Board for Higher Mathematics|NBHM]] collection, funded by grants from the [[National Board for Higher Mathematics]].

Ranganathan]] as the head.&lt;ref name=docencyclo&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=HSFu99FCJwQC&amp;pg=PA697&amp;dq=indian+statistical+institute+ranganathan#v=onepage&amp;q=indian%20statistical%20institute%20ranganathan&amp;f=false | page = 697 | last = Wedeworth | first = Robert | publisher = American Library Association | year = 1993 | title = World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services | edition = 3 | accessdate = 23 December 2012| isbn = 9780838906095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Mahalanobis planned of starting a full-fledged centre of ISI here around the mid-sixties. In 1966, the then [[Government of Karnataka]] granted ISI 30 acres of forest land full of [[eucalyptus]] trees, next to the upcoming campus of the [[Bangalore University]], located on the [[State Highway 17 (Karnataka)|Mysore Road]] on the outskirts of the city.&lt;ref name=isibhome&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after death of Prof. Mahalanobis in 1972, the project of establishing Bangalore centre got temporarily shelved. The project was again revived during 1976–78. Concrete proposals were made to the Government of India to get grants for the development of the land already in possession of ISI, along with the construction of an academic block with a library and offices.&lt;ref name=isibhome/&gt;

In the meantime, a building was rented on [[Church Street (Bangalore)|Church Street]], in Bangalore downtown, and various activities of the Bangalore Centre started in September 1978. The Economic Analysis Unit (EAU) and the Statistics and Mathematics Unit (SMU) were established. The SQC&amp;OR Unit and the DRTC unit, which were functioning from other rented buildings at that time, joined this new Centre.

As construction of the administrative block at the new campus got completed, the various units moved to the new campus in May 1985. The sprawling green wooded Campus has Residential Facility for students, faculty and staff.

The Bangalore centre was formally declared as a centre of ISI in September 1996.&lt;ref name=isibhome/&gt;

The Systems Science and Informatics Unit (SSIU) was established in 2009&lt;ref name=isibhome/&gt;

The Bangalore centre has by now became an institution well known for its academic activities in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, SQC and Operations Research, Library and Information Science, and Quantitative Economics.&lt;ref name=isibhome/&gt;

The Bangalore campus offers bachelor level course Bachelor of Mathematics (B. Math), master level courses Master of Mathematics (M. Math), Master of Science (M. S.) in Library and Information Science and Master of Science (M. S.) in Quality Management Science, and doctoral programs.&lt;ref name=prog/&gt;

'''Industrial Symbiosis'''&lt;ref&gt;Lombardi, D. R. and Laybourn, P. (2012), Redefining Industrial Symbiosis. Journal of Industrial Ecology, 16: 28–37. doi: 10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00444.x&lt;/ref&gt; a subset of [[industrial ecology]]. It describes how a network of diverse organizations can foster eco-innovation and long-term culture change, create and share mutually profitable transactions - and improve business and technical processes.

Although geographic proximity is often associated with industrial symbiosis, it is neither necessary nor sufficient—nor is a singular focus on physical resource exchange.  In practice, using industrial symbiosis as an approach to commercial operations – using, recovering and redirecting resources for reuse – results in resources remaining in productive use in the economy for longer. This in turn creates business opportunities, reduces demands on the earth’s [[natural resource|resources]], and provides a stepping-stone towards creating a [[circular economy]].  The industrial symbiosis model devised and managed by International Synergies Limited is a facilitated model operating at the national scale in the United Kingdom (NISP - National Industrial Symbiosis Programme), and at other scales around the world. International Synergies Limited has developed global expertise in IS, instigating programmes in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa and Turkey, as well as the UK.&lt;ref&gt;AM Hein, M Jankovic, R Farel, B Yannou 2015.

Proceedings of the ASME 2015 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences &amp; Computers and Information in Engineering Conference IDETC/CIE 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial symbiosis is a subset of [[industrial ecology]], with a particular focus on material and energy exchange. Industrial ecology is a relatively new field that is based on a natural paradigm, claiming that an [[industrial ecology|industrial ecosystem]] may behave in a similar way to the natural [[ecosystem]] wherein everything gets recycled, albeit the simplicity and applicability of this paradigm has been questioned &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levine|first1=S.H.|title=Comparing Products and Production in Ecological and Industrial Systems|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|date=2003|volume=7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=P.

==Introduction==
[[Eco-industrial development]] is one of the ways in which [[industrial ecology]] contributes to the integration of economic growth and [[environmental protection]]. Some of the examples of eco-industrial development are:

* [[Circular economy]] (single material and/or energy exchange)
* [[Greenfield land|Greenfield]] [[eco-industrial development]] (geographically confined space)
* [[Brownfield land|Brownfield]] [[eco-industrial development]] (geographically confined space)
* Eco-industrial network (no strict requirement of geographical proximity)
* Virtual eco-industrial network (networks spread in large areas e.g. regional network)
* Networked Eco-industrial System (macro level developments with links across regions)&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal A. &amp; Strachan P. 2006. Literature review on eco-industrial development initiatives around the world and the methods employed to evaluate their performance / effectiveness, Consultancy Report prepared for Databuild Ltd. and National Industrial Symbiosis Programme, 7 May 2006, Available from {{cite web |url=http://www.abhishekagarwal.co.uk/7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229213926/http://www.abhishekagarwal.co.uk/7.html |archivedate=29 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"''This classification omits any industrial sector-wide approaches and appreciates the diversity of the industrial system which is a key feature of industrial symbiosis. It is aimed to include initiatives that focus on achieving utility sharing and symbiosis among diverse sectors of industry''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Literature review on eco-industrial development initiatives around the world and the methods employed to evaluate their performance / effectiveness |url=http://www2.rgu.ac.uk/abs/National%20Industrial%20Symbiosis/Report%20for%20Databuild%20New.pdf |publisher=The Robert Gordon University |accessdate=24 April 2014 |author=Mr. Abhishek Agarwal and Dr. Peter Strachan |date=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414040648/http://www2.rgu.ac.uk/abs/National%20Industrial%20Symbiosis/Report%20for%20Databuild%20New.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal A. &amp; Strachan P. 2006.

Industrial symbiosis engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to [[competitive advantage]] involving physical exchange of materials, energy, water, and/or by-products. The keys to industrial symbiosis are [[collaboration]] and the [[synergistic]] possibilities offered by geographic proximity".&lt;ref&gt;Chertow, M. R. 2000.  Industrial Symbiosis: Literature and Taxonomy, Annual Review of Energy and the Environment, 25: 313-337.
&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, this definition and the stated key aspects of industrial symbiosis, i.e., the role of collaboration and geographic proximity, in its variety of forms, has been explored and empirically tested in the UK through the research and published activities of the National Industrial Symbiosis Programme &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=P. D.|last2=et al.|title=Quantifying Geographic Proximity: Experiences from the United Kingdom's National Industrial Symbiosis Programme|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|date=2011|volume=55|issue=7|url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/29718/88/Quantifying_%27Geographic_Proximity%27_%28Jensen_et_al__2011%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lombardi|first1=D.

Industrial symbiosis systems collectively optimize material and energy use at efficiencies beyond those achievable by any individual process alone. IS systems such as the web of materials and energy exchanges among companies in [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park|Kalundborg, Denmark]] have spontaneously evolved from a series of micro innovations over a long time scale;&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenfeld, J. and Gertler, N. 1997. Industrial Ecology in Practice: The Evolution of Interdependence at [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park|Kalundborg]], Journal of Industrial Ecology 1(1): 67.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the engineered design and implementation of such systems from a macro planner’s perspective, on a relatively short time scale, proves challenging. Nevertheless, there are examples of industrial symbiosis being approached as national / regional initiatives with some significant success particularly in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Costa I., Massard G. and Agarwal A. 2010. Waste management policies for industrial symbiosis development: case studies in European countries, Journal of Cleaner Production 18: 815-822.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, access to information on available by-products is difficult to obtain. These by-products are considered [[waste]] and typically not traded or listed on any type of exchange.

==Example==
Recent work reviewed government policies necessary to construct a multi-gigaWatt [[photovoltaic]] factory and complementary policies to protect existing solar companies are outlined and the technical requirements for a '''symbiotic industrial system''' are explored to increase the manufacturing efficiency while improving the environmental impact of [[solar photovoltaic cells]]. The results of the analysis show that an eight-factory industrial symbiotic system can be viewed as a medium-term investment by any government, which will not only obtain direct financial return, but also an improved global environment.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, J.M. 2008.

The '''International Geography Olympiad''' ('''iGeo''') is an annual competition for 16- to 19-year-old [[geography]] students from all over the world. Students chosen to represent their countries are some of the best, chosen from thousands of students who participate enthusiastically in their own National Geography Olympiads. iGeo tests the abilities of every participants in spatial patterns and processes. The iGeo consists of three parts: a written test, a multimedia test and a substantial fieldwork exercise requiring observation, leading to cartographic representation and geographical analysis. The programme also includes poster presentations by teams, cultural exchanges, and time for students to get to know their fellow students and explore the host city.

The International Geography Olympiad is organised by the [[International Geographical Union]] (IGU) Olympiad Task Force, who produce tests with reference to the local organisers and the international board.

After the first iGeo in 1996, it was recommended that the competition was held biennially. Due to the competition growing in popularity, since 2012 the competition has been held annually, rather than biennially, as is the case with the other large [[International Science Olympiad]]s.

== History of competition and national success ==

During the 1994 Congress of the International Geographical Union (IGU) in [[Prague]], people from [[Poland]] and the [[Netherlands]] launched the idea of an International Geography Competition (iGeo) or Olympiad for students between 15 and 19 years of age. The first one was held in 1996 in [[The Hague]], Netherlands, with five participating countries. The participant count grew to 24 countries with the 2008 competition in [[Carthage]], [[Tunisia]].

Before 2012, the International Science Olympiads were held every two years, and some regional geography Olympiads were held during intervening years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geoolympiad.org/fass/geoolympiad/what-is-igeo/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; These include the Asia Pacific Regional Geography Olympiads (APRGO), which were held in 2007 (Hsinchu, Taiwan&lt;ref&gt;http://promotinggeog.geo.ntnu.edu.tw/iGeo2010taipei/introduction.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://spock.nehs.hc.edu.tw/newsletter/1205/B.htm&lt;/ref&gt;), 2009 (Tsukuba, Japan&lt;ref&gt;http://japan-igeo.com/english/pdf/result.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), and 2011 (Merida, Mexico&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gtansw.org.au/files/geog_bulletin/2012/2_GTA%20Bulletin%201%202012-2_Asia%20Pacific%20Olympiad.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), and the Central European Regional Geography Olympiads (CERIGEO). Since 2013, the International Geography Olympiad, in concordance with the other Olympiads, has been held on a yearly basis.

At the most recent iGeo, held in [[Quebec City]], [[Canada]] between July and August 2018, there were 43 participating countries.

The next Olympiad is the 2019 iGeo, which will be held in [[Hong Kong]], China in August 2019.

{{improve categories|date=March 2018}}

The '''interstitium''' is a [[wikt:contiguity|contiguous]] fluid-filled space existing between a structural barrier, such as a [[cell wall]] or the skin, and internal structures, such as [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], including [[muscle]]s and the [[circulatory system]].&lt;ref name="bert"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bert JL|author2=Pearce RH|title=The interstitium and microvascular exchange.

==Structure==
The non-fluid parts of the interstitium are predominantly [[collagen]] types I, III, and V, [[elastin]], and [[glycosaminoglycan]]s, such as [[hyaluronate]] and [[proteoglycan]]s that are cross-linked to form a [[honeycomb]]-like [[Reticulum (anatomy)|reticulum]].&lt;ref name=scallan/&gt; Such structural components exist both for the general interstitium of the body,&lt;ref name=wiig/&gt; and within individual organs, such as the [[heart]] and [[kidney]].&lt;ref name="heart"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Eckhouse SR|author2=Spinale FG|title=Changes in the myocardial interstitium and contribution to the progression of heart failure|journal=Heart Fail Clin|date=2012|volume=8|issue=1|pages=7–20|doi=10.1016/j.hfc.2011.08.012|pmid=22108723|pmc=3227393}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kidney"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4594057|year=2015|author1=Zeisberg|first1=M|title=Physiology of the Renal Interstitium|journal=Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology|volume=10|issue=10|pages=1831–1840|last2=Kalluri|first2=R|doi=10.2215/CJN.00640114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The interstitial fluid is a reservoir and transportation system for nutrients and solutes distributing among organs, cells, and [[capillary|capillaries]], for [[signaling molecule]]s communicating between cells, and for [[antigen]]s and [[cytokine]]s participating in [[immune system|immune regulation]].&lt;ref name=wiig/&gt; The composition and chemical properties of the interstitial fluid vary among organs and undergo changes in chemical composition during normal function, as well as during [[Human body|body growth]], conditions of [[inflammation]], and development of [[disease]]s,&lt;ref name=wiig/&gt; as in [[heart failure]]&lt;ref name=heart/&gt; and [[chronic kidney disease]].&lt;ref name=kidney/&gt;

The total fluid volume of the interstitium during health is about 20% of body weight, but this space is dynamic and may change in volume and composition during immune responses and in conditions such as [[cancer]], and specifically within the interstitium of [[tumor]]s.&lt;ref name=wiig/&gt; The amount of interstitial fluid varies from about 50% of the tissue weight in [[skin]] to about 10% in [[skeletal muscle]].&lt;ref name=wiig/&gt;

==Research ==
Preliminary research of the interstitium in people with [[Respiratory disease|lung diseases]], heart disease, [[cancer]], kidney disease, [[immune disorder]]s, and [[periodontal disease]] indicates that the interstitial fluid and lymph system are sites where disease mechanisms may arise or develop.&lt;ref name=wiig/&gt;&lt;ref name=heart/&gt;&lt;ref name=kidney/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=24503053|year=2014|author1=Berggreen|first1=E|title=Lymphatic function and responses in periodontal disease|journal=Experimental Cell Research|volume=325|issue=2|pages=130–7|last2=Wiig|first2=H|doi=10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.12.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the interstitium in [[bile duct]] tissue was identified and studied using [[confocal]] laser [[endoscopy|endomicroscopy]] and [[fluorescein]] injection.&lt;ref name=benias/&gt; A microscopic subcompartment of the interstitial space, having a depth of {{convert|60|–|70|μm|in}} and filled with lymph, was reported as draining into [[lymph node]]s, and was structurally supported by a network of [[collagen]].&lt;ref name="benias"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benias|first=Petros C.|last2=Wells|first2=Rebecca G.|last3=Sackey-Aboagye|first3=Bridget|last4=Klavan|first4=Heather|last5=Reidy|first5=Jason|last6=Buonocore|first6=Darren|last7=Miranda|first7=Markus|last8=Kornacki|first8=Susan|last9=Wayne|first9=Michael|date=2018-03-27|title=Structure and Distribution of an Unrecognized Interstitium in Human Tissues|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23062-6|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-23062-6|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1591">"'''The law of the suppression of radical potential'''" is an idea first described by [[Brian Winston]] in his book, ''Misunderstanding Media''. According to the law, when a communications technology is realized, its growth is suppressed through the constraining influence of already prevailing institutions and other mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=McQuail's Mass Communication Theory |authorlink=Denis McQuail |last=McQuail |first=Denis |page=156 |year=2010 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |isbn=978-1-84920-292-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winston shows how the law can be used as a model for describing the life cycle of many communications technologies. His approach is in particular directed against [[technological determinism]] and instead proposes that the [[emergence]] of new media and new technologies is mediated and controlled by society. According to Winston, a supervening social necessity creates a need for a particular technology, but the Law of the suppression of radical potential means that new technology will be integrated into the status quo as opposed to radically disrupting it. 

Winston has elaborated his model of technological change in particular in the books ''Technologies of Seeing: Photography, Cinematography and Television'' (1997) and ''Media Technology and Society: A History: From the Telegraph to the Internet'' (1998; Kindle publication in 2007 )

'''Non-Starchy Vegetables''' are [[vegetables]] that contain a lower amount of [[carbohydrates]] and [[calories]] compared to their [[starch]]y counterparts. Thus, for the same calories, one can eat a larger quantity of non-starchy vegetables compared to smaller servings of starchy vegetables.

When business partner [[Sam Goldwyn]] saw a scene in which only half an actor's face was illuminated, he feared the exhibitors would pay only half the price for the picture.

In George W. Bush's own words, "I told [[Laura Bush|Laura]] and our artist friend [[Pamela Nelson|Pam Nelson]] that I might like to take up painting. They were surprised — I had been an art-agnostic all my life. Laura said, “You ought to try it.” It seemed like she was slightly skeptical. Pam suggested I hire her friend Gail Norfleet, a notable and talented Dallas artist, as my instructor. Several days later, Gail came over to the house and asked me what my objectives were. “Gail, there's a Rembrandt trapped in this body,” I told her. “Your job is to liberate him.”"&lt;/ref&gt; and best expertly researched (visual) artists in history.&lt;ref name="Slive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FranitsAshgate2016"/&gt;

His life and art have long attracted the attention of multidisciplinary scholarship such as [[art history]], [[social history]], [[cultural history]], [[history of ideas]], [[education]], [[humanities]], [[aesthetics]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[literary studies]], [[anatomy]], [[medicine]], [[religious studies]], [[theology]], [[Jewish studies]], [[Oriental studies]] ([[Asian studies]]), [[globalization studies]], and [[art market|art market research]]. In Rembrandt scholar Stephanie Dickey's words: {{quote|[Rembrandt] earned international renown as a painter, printmaker, teacher, and art collector while never leaving the Dutch Republic. In his home city of Leiden and in Amsterdam, where he worked for nearly forty years, he mentored generations of other painters and produced a body of work that has never ceased to attract admiration, critique, and interpretation. (...) Rembrandt's art is a key component in any study of the Dutch Golden Age, and his membership in the canon of artistic genius is well established, but he is also a figure whose significance transcends specialist interest. Literary critics have pondered "Rembrandt" as a "cultural text"; novelists, playwrights, and filmmakers have romanticized his life, and in popular culture, his name has become synonymous with excellence for products and services, ranging from toothpaste to self-help advice."&lt;ref name="FranitsAshgate2016"&gt;Franits, Wayne (ed.): ''The Ashgate Research Companion to Dutch Art of the Seventeenth Century''. (Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For a visual artist in general and an [[Old Master]] in particular, Rembrandt (i.e. his life, art, and circle) has been the subject of a vast amount of literature that includes both [[fiction]] and nonfiction works. The field of [[:Category:Rembrandt studies|Rembrandt studies]] (study of Rembrandt's life and work, including works by [[List of Rembrandt pupils|his pupils and followers]]) — as an academic field in its own right with many noted [[List of Rembrandt connoisseurs and scholars|Rembrandt connoisseurs and scholars]] — has been one of the most dynamic research areas of [[Netherlandish art]] (or [[art of the Low Countries|art of the pre-1830 Low Countries]]) history.&lt;ref name="Slive"&gt;[[Seymour Slive|Slive, Seymour]]: ''Rembrandt and his Critics, 1630–1730''. (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1953)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dickey, Stephanie: ''Rembrandt and his Circle: Insights and Discoveries''. (Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The London Centre for Nanotechnology''' is a multidisciplinary research centre in physical and biomedical [[nanotechnology]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. It brings together three institutions that are world leaders in nanotechnology, [[University College London]], [[Imperial College London]] and [[King's College London]]. It was conceived from the outset with a management structure allowing for a clear focus on exploitation and commercialisation. Although based at UCL's campus in [[Bloomsbury]], the LCN includes research in departments of Imperial's [[South Kensington]] campus and in King's [[Strand, London|Strand]] campus.

The LCN's work requires it to draw on the combined skills of multiple departments, including medicine, chemistry, physics, electrical and electronic engineering, biochemical engineering, materials and earth sciences, and two leading business centres. The LCN’s stated vision is to become Europe’s premier research centre in nanotechnology applied to health care, information technology and the environment.

==History==

The London Centre for Nanotechnology was established as a joint venture between UCL and [[Imperial College London]] in 2003 following the award of a £13.65m higher education grant under the Science Research Infrastructure Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2698649.stm | title=London's little idea|accessdate=31 October 2010|publisher=BBC News| date=27 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2981480.stm | title=Nanotech under the microscope|accessdate=31 October 2010 | publisher=BBC News| date=12 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006 the LCN installed the first monochromated electron microscope in the UK at its site on the [[Imperial College London]] campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/news/2006/october/20100601.asp | title=UK researchers unveil country's most powerful microscope|accessdate=31 October 2010 | publisher=Chemistry World| date=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008 the LCN published research about the possibility of using microscopic "nanoprobes" to discover new drugs to combat [[antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7663437.stm| title='Nanotech search' for antibiotics|accessdate=31 October 2010 | publisher=BBC News| date=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009 a team at the Science and Technology Facilities Council's ISIS facility led by Stephen Bramwell of the LCN published research showing that single magnetic charges be made to behave and interact like electrical ones through the use of the magnetic monopoles that exist in [[spin ice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8307804.stm| title='Magnetic electricity' discovered|accessdate=31 October 2010 | publisher=BBC News| date=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[King's College London]] joined the LCN in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=King's College London joins powerhouse of nanotechnology research |url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/news-article.aspx?id=00e47784-a09f-4283-b9b7-d510af277484 |website=King's College London |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research areas ==

LCN's research is organised around three themes, which it characterizes as follows:

•	'''Information Technology:''' Computing and communications needs continue to grow and underpin all other human endeavours. Current technologies are limited and new nanotechnology-driven paradigms such as quantum computing and spintronics are needed.

•	'''Health care:''' Under development are specialised sensors and novel cancer-diagnosis systems, as well as new insights into cellular biophysics and nanotechnology-based instrumentation.

•	'''Planet Care:''' The LCN uses its expertise, ranging from biology to chemistry and materials science, to conduct research in areas including novel photovoltaics, new approaches to exploring current energy supplies, low-power lighting and computing, new materials, instrumentation for the nuclear industry, and storing hydrogen efficiently at room temperature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3303">The low basis theorem is one of several [[Basis theorem (computability)|basis theorems]] in computability theory, each of which shows that, given an infinite subtree of the binary tree &lt;math&gt;2^{&lt;\omega}&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to find an infinite path through the tree with particular computability properties. The low basis theorem, in particular, shows that there must be a path which is [[low_(computability)|low]], that is, the [[Turing jump]] of the path is Turing equivalent to the [[halting problem]] &lt;math&gt;\emptyset'&lt;/math&gt;.

== Statement and proof ==

The low basis theorem states that every nonempty [[Π01_class|&lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt; class]] in &lt;math&gt;2^\omega&lt;/math&gt; (see [[arithmetical hierarchy]]) contains a set of [[low (computability)|low degree]] (Soare 1987:109). This is equivalent, by definition, to the statement that each infinite computable subtree of the binary tree &lt;math&gt;2^{&lt;\omega}&lt;/math&gt; has an infinite path of low degree. 

The proof uses the method of forcing with &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_1&lt;/math&gt; classes (Cooper 2004:330).   Hájek and Kučera (1989) showed that the low basis is provable in the formal system of arithmetic known as &lt;math&gt;\text{I-}\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Application ==

One application of the low basis theorem is to construct completions of effective theories so that the completions have low Turing degree. For example, the low basis theorem implies the existence of [[PA degree]]s strictly below &lt;math&gt;\emptyset'&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Marcel Linsman Prize''' (or '''Linsman Prize''') is a Belgian prize awarded every 3 years by the influential AILg (Association des Ingenieurs Diplomés de la Université de Liège), a Belgian academic association of engineers, to living scientists for excellence in the biomedical sciences. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.ailg.be/index.php?page=prix-marcel-linsman|title= Prix Marcel Linsman|publisher=Association des Ingenieurs Diplomés de la Université de Liège|accessdate = 26 November 2015}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The prize is restricted to researchers with a medical or engineering degree having performed research in Belgium. The age limit is 45 years but there is no restriction on the citizenship. For many years, the preference has been given to researchers in the field of neuroscience. This prize is awarded in memory of Marcel Linsman (1912-1989), distinguished University Professor.

The prize is usually awarded during an official ceremony taking place in one Belgian university during which two other prestigious prizes in different fields are awarded. Similar to other prestigious prize ceremonies, the recipients deliver a scientific presentation of their research.

The reputation achieved by this prize is ubiquitously recognized amongst academics in Europe.

== Marcel Linsman ==
Born in Liège on 22 June 1912, he studied mathematical sciences at the University of Liège, receiving his bachelor's degree in 1934. In 1937, he received his doctorate, with the highest distinction" He was appointed assistant professor at Liège in 1938, and in 1964, full professor.  In 1943, he became interested in numerical calculation and recognized immediately the electronic possibilities.  He moved to Harvard University in 1947. From 1951 to 1955, he managed the development of one of the earliest European electronic computers, known as Machine I.R.S.I.A. His interest then took him into non-numerical applications of the computer. Starting with automatic translation, he initiated many projects, including teaching informatics and medical applications. Throughout his career, he was the recipient of many awards.

In IFIP, he was present from the first Council meeting in Rome until 1971, representing the Belgian member society. He was also active in the Technical Committee on Education (TC3). During the time IFIP was registered in Belgium, 1962 through 1967, he served as IFIP Assistant Secretary and handled all legal matters for IFIP.  In 1974, he was in the first group to receive the IFIP Silver Core Award.

Marcel Linsman died during the night from 18 to 19 April 1989.  A foundation in his name has been established to promote scientific excellence in the field of biomedical sciences.

The '''media and American adolescent sexuality''' relates to the effect the media has on the [[Adolescent sexuality in the United States|sexuality of American adolescents]], and the portrayal thereof.

According to Sexual Teens, Sexual Media: Investigating Media's Influence on Adolescent Sexuality, adolescence can be divided into three different stages; early (ages 8–13 years), middle(ages 13–16 for girls, 14-17 for boys) and late (16 and older for girls, 17 and older for boys). Each stage focuses on different aspects of cognitive, physical, social and psychological development. Although not all teens develop through adolescence at the same rate the stages usually follow a specific pattern. For a teen in the early stages of adolescence they are in the beginning stages of puberty. In this stage of adolescence, relationships begin to become important as well as their physical appearance. Middle adolescence is characterized by independence from their family and increased activity with their peers. This is the stage where sexual activity may begin to occur. The last stage of adolescence the teenager begins to feel more secure in their bodies and their sexual behavior. With these aspects of adolescence in mind, media can play an important role in how teen shape their views about sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sexual Teens, Sexual Media: Investigating Media's Influence on Adolescent Sexuality|year=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|pages=2|author1=Jane D. Brown |author2=Jeanne R. Steele |author3=Kim Walsh-Childers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers remain divided on the role of sexuality in the media on adolescent sexual health.  The American Academy of Pediatrics has argued that media representations of sexuality may influence teen sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="PED media"/&gt;  However some scholars have argued that such claims have been premature.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2010"&gt;Steinberg, L., &amp; Monahan, K.  2010.  Developmental Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite increasing amounts of sexual media US Government statistic state that teens have delayed the onset of sexual intercourse in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;childstats.gov&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalism professor and media critic Jane Brown, the media is piquing teen interest in sex at ages younger than previous.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt; Dr. Brown argues that research has "found a direct relationship between the amount of sexual content children see and their level of sexual activity or their intentions to have sex in the future."&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JAH media"/&gt;  However, the direction (and mechanism) of causality remains unclear.

==Sexuality in the media==
Some scholars argue that American media is the most sexually suggestive in the world.&lt;ref name="Strasburger"/&gt; According to this view, the sexual messages contained in film, television, and music are becoming more explicit in dialog, lyrics, and behavior. In addition, these messages may contain unrealistic, inaccurate, and misleading information. Some scholars argue that still developing teens may be particularly vulnerable to media effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruber|first=Enid|author2=Grube, Joel|title=Adolescent Sexuality and the Media|journal=Western Journal of Medicine|date=March 2000|volume=172|series=3|pages=210–214|doi=10.1136/ewjm.172.3.210|pmc=1070813}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 report found that teens rank the media second only to school sex education programs as a leading source of information about sex,&lt;ref name="PED media" /&gt; but a 2004 report found that "the media far outranked parents or schools as the source of information about birth control."&lt;ref name="Strasburger" /&gt;

Media often portray emotional side-effects of sexuality such as guilt, and disappointment, but less often physical risks such as pregnancy or STDs.&lt;ref name="Roberts et al."&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Roberts| author2=Henriksen| author3=Foehr| last-author-amp=yes| title=Adolescence,adolescents, and media| journal=Handbook of Adolescent Sexuality| edition=3rd| year=2009| volume=2| pages=314–344| doi=10.1002/9780470479193.adlpsy002010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One media analysis found that sex was usually between unmarried couples and examples of using condoms or other contraception were "extremely rare."&lt;ref name="JAH media"/&gt; Many of programs or films do not depict consequence for sexual behavior. For example, only 10% programs that contain sexual scenes include any warnings to the potential risks or responsibilities of having sex such as sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"/&gt; In television programming aimed at teens, more than 90% of episodes had at least one sexual reference in it with an average of 7.9 references per hour.&lt;ref name="aubrey"/&gt;

However, government statistics suggest that since 1991, both teen sex and teen pregnancy have declined dramatically despite the media generally becoming increasingly sexually explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://childstats.gov/americaschildren/beh4.asp|title=Childstats.gov - America's Children: Key National Indicators of Well-Being, 2017 - Sexual Activity|website=childstats.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of the media on beliefs about sex==
Some scholars feel that adolescents may turn to the media as a "sexual super peer" when seeking information about sexual norms and adult roles given the lack of information about sexuality readily available to them.&lt;ref name="JAH media"/&gt; For example, in one study of 13-and 14-year-olds, heavy exposure to sexually oriented television also increased acceptance of non-marital sex.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"/&gt; Another study found that teens overestimate how many of their peers are sexually active, a problem contributed to by the media.&lt;ref name="media impact"/&gt;

Another study found that middle-school-aged boys who watch music videos or pro-wrestling one day a week are 10% more likely to have a higher acceptance rate for rape than boys who do not watch any.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;!--&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt;--&gt; Boys who watch music videos four days a week and pro wrestling 1.7 days a week (the mean exposure rate for boys) have 70% higher odds of endorsing a greater level of rape acceptance.&lt;ref name="Kaestle"/&gt; "Both music videos and pro wrestling shows are popular with youth, combine violent and sexual content, and glorify individuals who behave violently."&lt;ref name="Kaestle"/&gt;

==Effects of the media on sexual behavior==

===Pregnancy===
Some researchers have found a correlation between the amount of television with high sexual content that teenagers watch and an increased likelihood of them becoming pregnant or fathering a child out of wedlock.&lt;ref name="tv sex"/&gt; Some studies suggest teens exposed to the most sexual content on TV are twice as likely as teens watching less of this material to become pregnant before they reach age 20.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

These researchers believe that reducing the amount of sexual content adolescents watch on television could substantially reduce the teen pregnancy rate.&lt;ref name="tv sex"/&gt; "It's a cumulative effect," Brown believes. "It's probably not any one portrayal that makes the difference, but it's a consistent, and now unhealthy, sexual script that adolescents do see as a depiction of appropriate behavior."&lt;ref name="brownusa"/&gt;

Several complementary studies have found that television viewing can influence multiple aspects of reproductive health among youths and that "earlier sexual initiation is associated with negative health outcomes."&lt;ref name="tv sex"/&gt; Previous research has suggested two ways that glamorized perception of sex may contribute to teen pregnancy: by encouraging teens to become sexually active early in their adolescence and by promoting inconsistent use of contraceptives.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

===Early sexual activity===
Some studies have also found that adolescents whose [[media diet]] was rich in sexual content were more than twice as likely as others to have had sex by the time they were 16.&lt;ref name="truth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Luscombe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watching sex"/&gt; In a Kaiser Family Foundation study, 76 percent of teens said that one reason young people have sex is because TV shows and movies make it seem normal for teens.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"/&gt; In addition to higher likelihoods that an adolescent exposed to sexual content in the media will engage in sexual behaviors, they are also have higher levels of intending to have sex in the future and more positive expectations of sex.&lt;ref name="tv sex 2006"/&gt;

Some studies suggest that children who watch adult content on television are more likely to have sex earlier once they reach adolescence.&lt;ref name="early tv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHB"/&gt; For every hour of adult-targeted television or movies watched by children when they were 6 to 8 years old, there was a 33% increased risk of becoming sexually active in early adolescence.

"Children have neither the life experience nor the brain development to fully differentiate between a reality they are moving toward and a fiction meant solely to entertain," explained David Bickham, a staff scientist in the Center on Media and Child Health.&lt;ref name="CHB"/&gt; "Children learn from the media, and when they watch media with sexual references and innuendos, our research suggests they are more likely to engage in sexual activity earlier in life."&lt;ref name="CHB"/&gt;

Other research has suggested that linking sexuality in media with adolescent sexual behavior is premature.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2010"/&gt; Steinberg and Monahan reanalized a dataset of teen sexual behavior (Collins et al.) using [[propensity score matching]] and discovered that with other risk factors controlled, viewing sexual media did not predict early onset of sexual behavior in adolescents. The authors concluded that links between media viewing and adolescent sexuality are more tenuous than previous believed.

Researchers on both sides of the debate acknowledge that assigning causality to correlations between media use and sexual behavior are difficult, given the lack of experimental research, and difficulty controlling for all potential confounding variables.&lt;ref name="Steinberg &amp; Monahan 2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steinberg |author2=Monahan |last-author-amp=yes |title=Premature Dissemination of Advice Undermines Our Credibility as Scientists : Reply to Brown (2011) and to Collins, Martino, and Elliott (2011) |journal=Developmental Psychology |year=2011 |volume=47 |pages=582–584 |doi=10.1037/a0022562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that the relationship between exposure to sexual contact in the media and increased sexual activity among adolescents is more pronounced in white youths than black youths. Black teens are more likely to be influenced by their friends' sexual experiences and their parents' expectations than by what they see in the media.&lt;ref name="sexy media"/&gt;

==Pornography==
Between the 3rd and 10th grades more than 90% of children will be exposed to pornography.&lt;ref name="porn"/&gt; Psychiatrist Jerald says access, affordability and anonymity have made online sexual activity "extraordinarily common" among all ages, including adolescents.&lt;ref name="porn"/&gt; Adolescents who intentionally seek out pornography, both online and off, are overwhelmingly male.&lt;ref name="Ybarra"/&gt; Older youth are more likely than younger youth to seek porn.&lt;ref name="Ybarra"/&gt; Individuals who are already at risk of being attracted to sexual aggression are more likely to be influenced by pornographic exposure. This in turn explains that these individuals are more likely to believe in the various unusual sexual behaviors as common causing negative effects towards sexual experiences. However, it is important that once these negative attitudes have been formed, it was not easily reversed by education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malamuth|first=Neil|date=October 1993|title=Pornography's Impact on Male Adolescent|url=|journal=Adolescent Medicine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical students' disease''' (also known as '''second year syndrome''' or '''intern's syndrome''') is a condition frequently reported in [[medical student]]s, who perceive themselves to be experiencing the symptoms of a disease that they are studying. 

The condition is associated with the fear of contracting the disease in question. Some authors suggested that the condition must be referred to as [[nosophobia]]&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;Hunter R.C.A, Lohrenz J.G., Schwartzman A.E. "Nosophobia and hypochondriasis in medical students". J Nerv Ment Dis 1964;130:147-52. {{PMID|14206454}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thakur-preunca&gt;Nikhil Thakur, Bogdan Preunca "Nosophobia presented as acute hypochondria". TMJ 56(2), 120&lt;/ref&gt; rather than "hypochondriasis", because the quoted studies show a very low percentage of [[hypochondria]]cal character of the condition, and hence the term "hypochondriasis" would have ominous therapeutic and prognostic indications. The reference&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt; suggests that the condition is associated with immediate preoccupation with the symptoms in question, leading the student to become unduly aware of various casual psychological and physiological dysfunctions; cases show little correlation with the severity of [[psychopathology]], but rather with accidental factors related to learning and experience.

==Overview==
Baars (2001) writes that medical students who study "frightening diseases" for the first time routinely experience vivid delusions of having contracted such diseases, and describes it as a "temporary kind of hypochondria". Baars says that the experience is so common that it has become known as "medical student syndrome".

Hodges (2004), reviewing the literature, said that "the first descriptions of medical students' disease appeared in the 1960s." He may have been referring to the phrase, for the phenomenon itself was noted much earlier. George Lincoln Walton (1908) reported that

:Medical instructors are continually consulted by students who fear that they have the diseases they are studying. The knowledge that pneumonia produces pain in a certain spot leads to a concentration of attention upon that region which causes any sensation there to give alarm. The mere knowledge of the location of the appendix transforms the most harmless sensations in that region into symptoms of serious menace.

Hodges also said that it was suggested in the 1960s that:
:This phenomenon caused a significant amount of stress for students and was present in approximately 70 to 80 percent of students... papers written in the 1980s and 1990s conceptualised the condition as an illness in the psychiatric spectrum of hypochondriasis.... Marcus found that the dream content of year two medical students frequently involved a preoccupation with personal illness. Marcus's subjects reported many dreams in which they suffered illnesses of the heart, the eyes and the bowels, among others.

Hodges went on to describe work by Moss-Morris and Pétrie who saw medical students' disease as "a normal perceptual process, rather than a form of hypochondriasis." Learning about a disease "creates a mental schema or representation of the illness which includes the label of the illness and the symptoms associated with the condition. Once this representation is formed, symptoms or bodily sensations that the individual is currently experiencing which are consistent with the schema may be noticed, while inconsistent symptoms are ignored."

Howes and Salkovskis (1998) noted that "medical students frequently develop fears and symptoms of illness. This has been termed medical student's disease, nosophobia, hypochondriasis of medical students, and medicalstudentitis." They mentioned two studies, one concluding that about 70% of medical students have groundless medical fears during their studies, and one which found that 78.8% of a randomly chosen sample of medical students showed a history of "medical student disease." However, they cite a number of studies showing a similar incidence of hypochondria in law students and other non-medical students, which they said call into question "the widely held view that medical students are more likely than others to have excessive anxiety about their health."

==In popular culture==
An episode of the TV show ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' called ''Our Driving Issues'' features a class of medical students who, despite having been warned about medical students' disease, nevertheless suffer from it.

In the Tamil Blockbuster Dharmadhurai one of the leads suffer from second year syndrome.

The '''National Agricultural Law Center'''  at the [[University of Arkansas]] is a federally funded, nonpartisan research and information center that serves as the nation's leading source of agricultural and food law research and information. The Center is the only institution of its kind in the United States and serves the nation's vast agricultural community, which includes attorneys, farmers, federal and state policymakers, extension personnel, academics, students, consumers, and others.

The Center operates in conjunction with the [[United States National Agricultural Library]], an entity within the [[USDA]] Agricultural Research Service.  
In addition, the Center enjoys an institutional cooperative partnership with the Drake Agricultural Law Center directed by [[Neil Hamilton (lawyer)|Neil D. Hamilton]].

The Center's website is the primary means by which it disseminates its agricultural and food law research and information products. The website is a clearinghouse for legal information that spans nearly four dozen agricultural and food law topics both in the United States and around the world. As such, the website incorporates unique components that cannot be found elsewhere and provides an invaluable resource to those needing information on legal issues surrounding food and agriculture.

The Center is a nonpartisan entity and takes no position on the views expressed in any articles or writings published on the website. All such articles and writings are included for their legal or practical discussions of agricultural or food law topics rather than any particular viewpoint. Furthermore, while every effort is made to supply accurate and up-to-date information, the website is not meant as a source of legal advice, nor is it a substitute for a competent legal professional.

To make the vast store of information provided by this website more user-friendly, the site is divided into sections to help focus the researcher on a particular task at hand.

== About the center ==
This section provides a description of the National Agricultural Law Center, its mission, its history, and its affiliations. Also included are contact information for the Center, biographical and contact information for Center staff, a list of contributors to the website's publications, multi-lingual translations of the Center's brochure, and links to the Center's bi-monthly e-Newsletter and [[The United States Agricultural &amp; Food Law and Policy Blog]].

== Reading rooms ==
One of the most important services provided by the National Agricultural Law Center is the construction and maintenance of its Reading Rooms. A Reading Room is a compilation of electronic resources that provides readers with a way to access extensive agricultural and food law research and information.

At the beginning of each Reading Room is an Overview article designed to familiarize the reader with the particular subject area, followed by a listing of major federal statutes affecting the area, links to applicable federal regulations, and a case law index of citations to recent common-law authority.

Secondary sources relevant to the Reading Room, including Center research publications, Congressional Research Service reports addressing agricultural and food law issues, governmental and non-governmental reference resources, and other publications are included in each Reading Room.

For example, the Agritourism Reading Room defines the term "agritourism" and briefly outlines some potential legal issues inherent in the topic, lists the relevant state and federal statutes that affect this area of the law, provides a case law index of precedential cases, and supplies links to various publications from the federal government, state governments, interested organizations, and experts in the field.

== Publications ==
This section contains articles researched and written by the Center's staff, leading agricultural and food law scholars, and legal practitioners throughout the country and the world. The publications are grouped by topic and listed in alphabetical order.

As a nonpartisan entity, the Center does not advocate for or against any particular viewpoint. While many articles may espouse an author's position on any given issue, the Center publishes the articles for the background and legal analysis on the subject. As such, the publications are provided to assist researchers in understanding the complex web of agricultural and food law issues that confront all components of the agricultural sector.

== The AgLaw Reporter ==
This section includes all issues of the Agricultural Law Update, the professional monthly newsletter of the American Agricultural Law Association (AALA). The Agricultural Law Update Newsletters contain useful and timely articles on a variety of agricultural topics ranging from conservation programs to taxation issues. In addition, the newsletters cover recent cases and laws that affect the nation's agricultural community and the attorneys and policymakers who represent them.

Also included in the area updates to the Federal Register Digest since January, 2002 that provide a brief summary of agricultural and food law regulatory changes published in the Federal Register.

Judicial Officer Decisions on cases heard by those delegated authority by the [[Secretary of Agriculture]] to act as the final deciding officer in USDA adjudicatory proceedings are also contained on this page. Case Law Indexes and Case Summaries compiled and written by Center staff and the ever-expanding are also included in the AgLaw Reporter. The case law indexes and the summaries of these cases provide an extensive annotation of the common law surrounding agricultural and food law issues throughout the country and around the world.

The State Law Clearinghouse provides readers with access to state statutes and administrative codes that regulate agricultural and food law issues such as states' biofuels statutes, recreational use statutes, animal cruelty laws, alternative dispute statutes, and climate change legislation. Many issues pertaining to agriculture are administered on the state or local level, and this resource is geared towards providing the statutory language of state laws and regulations that affect agriculture and food.

== Farm bills ==
Another important service provided by the National Agricultural Law Center, and one of the most popular, is the complete collection of digitized farm bills from the original legislation in 1933 to the most recently enacted 2008 Farm Bill, technically known as the [[Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008]]. Legislative history of each [[U.S. Farm Bill]], research articles, and links to outside sources concerning the farm bills are included also included in this section of the Center's website.

The depth and breadth of material provided in this area of the website surpasses anything else currently available, making it one of the most complete reference collections anywhere for United States Farm Bills.

== Glossary ==
Agriculture and food law contains thousands of words, definitions, and acronyms not commonly understood by laypersons or many attorneys. To remedy that problem Chuck Culver, Director for Development for the Division of Agriculture at the University of Arkansas, has created and published the Glossary of Agricultural Production, Programs, and Policy—Fourth Edition, an extensive list of legal and non-legal definitions of terms and acronyms used in the food and agricultural fields.

== Agricultural law bibliography ==
Professor Drew Kershen, Earl Sneed Centennial Professor of Law at the [[University of Oklahoma College of Law]], created the Agricultural Law Bibliography, which is a bibliography of agricultural law that spans over 50 years of law journals, law reviews, and legal periodicals that publish articles, comments, notes, and developments that comprise the body of published research in agricultural and food law. The Agricultural Law Bibliography is updated quarterly and published on the Center web site.

Center staff are currently contacting authors and publications listed in the bibliography in an effort to provide digitized copies of as many of the listed articles as possible. More than 1000 articles have been digitized to date.

== Congressional Research Service Reports ==
The Center provides an extensive database of Congressional Research Service Reports pertinent to agricultural and food law and policy issues. The [[Congressional Research Service]] reports are a non-partisan objective analysis of a question posed by a congressman or woman and commonly range in length from 5 to around 30 pages. The reports are grouped according to topic and subtopic, including areas such as animal agriculture, international trade, climate change, and environmental law. The Center continuously publishes new Congressional Research Service reports as they become available.

== Reference desk ==
This section contains the links to many different organizations that have some focus on agriculture or agricultural law. Links on this page include government websites, universities, law reviews and journals, associations, practice groups, libraries, and publications.

== State compilations ==
The State Law Clearinghouse provides readers with access to state statutes and administrative codes that regulate agricultural issues. Many issues pertaining to agriculture and food are administered on the state or local level, and this resource is geared towards providing the statutory language of state laws and regulations that affect agriculture.

'''Neurological reparative therapy''' ('''NRT''') is a new model of treatment synthesized from a compilation of literature and research on how to better the lives of individuals who suffer from a wide range of [[mind|mental]], [[emotional]], and [[behavioral]] disturbances – particularly children and adolescents. Although the term "neurological reparative therapy" is new, the foundation of this model is not.

NRT is not a [[proscription|proscriptive]] model, in that it does not outline ''how'' the therapy is to be conducted. A preponderance of evidence shows that the most important component of successful treatment is not the approach or techniques, but the professional caring and competence of the therapist engaging with the client in a supportive, cathartic, and healing manner. The NRT roadmap provides the best route to healthy brain development, attachment, and resiliency, but relies on the helper to use his or her own skills, experience, and techniques to take the journey.

==Principles==
Neurological reparative therapy is not a program or a technique, but is better explained as a roadmap describing the journey of [[healing]] and repair of the [[mental process]]es preventing the individual from achieving personal goals and personal contentment. NRT outlines the goal and ultimate destination of treatment, and provides a roadmap with the mileposts along the way. NRT does not proscribe the methods, the techniques, or the approaches that are the vehicle for the client and [[therapist]] to travel the road together. NRT is specifically designed to optimize the [[skills]] and abilities of the therapist by taking advantage of the therapist's [[knowledge]], [[training]], and experience in joining with the clients on the healing journey. The model outlines what needs to be addressed in treatment – the therapy components critical to internal change – and points out that "knowing where you are going" is the key to arriving successfully at the destination.

== History ==
Although the term neurological reparative therapy is relatively new, the history of the model goes back many decades. NRT has its foundation in the integrated treatment of extreme [[mind|mental]], [[emotional]], and [[behavioral]] disturbances in very young children. The term was first used in the writings of a psychologist, [[David Lee Ziegler, Ph.D.|D.L. Ziegler]], working with children who had experienced severe trauma and [[abuse]].&lt;ref name="Ziegler NRT"&gt;Ziegler, D.L. (2011).  Neurological Reparative Therapy, a roadmap to healing, resiliency and well-being.  Jasper, OR: Jasper Mountain.&lt;/ref&gt; Ziegler found that integrating brain research, [[attachment theory]], and [[Psychological resilience|resiliency]] work within trauma treatment resulted in an unexpected outcome – significant functional improvement following the cessation of treatment. This led him to the conclusion that the change was ''internal'' (i.e. neurological) in nature, and was not conditional upon a place, an individual, or the environmental circumstances. After studying years of practice-based evidence, it was found that the treatment orientation or approach of the therapist was not the determining factor in positive outcomes, but rather the integration of components of positive brain change (attachment, resiliency, and trauma treatment within the framework of how the brain functions) that frequently resulted in change "from the inside out".

== Integrated components ==
The four pillars of neurological reparative therapy are [[Neural development|Brain Development]], [[Attachment Theory|Attachment]], Resiliency, and Trauma Treatment. The integration of all these components provides the [[synergy]] that leads to optimal positive brain change, which provides lasting change. Of these pillars, the research and literature on attachment is the oldest of the four, going back nearly a half-century. The ability of an individual to successfully bond and attach to others has been growing in importance as new information is learned about how the [[human body]] – and specifically how the brain – modulates and copes with [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. There is now a new resurgence in focusing on attachment in the treatment process of individuals, couples, and families. Resiliency research is showing it is not the negative experiences everyone encounters in life that is key, but rather the ability of the individual to cope with and bounce back from adverse situations. Resiliency is growing in importance not only in [[mental health]] settings but also in educational, occupational, and medical areas. The pillar that has seen the most influx over the last two decades has been brain development. The explosion of new information has been facilitated by sophisticated [[Neuroimaging|brain scanning]] technology, to determine in real time how the brain is processing and responding to interventions. At this point, our knowledge of the brain and how it works is doubling every ten years. NRT works to integrate new information on the brain into the healing process. While the field of trauma treatment is as old as is attachment, it takes significant advantage of the new research on brain development to better target the brain with positive change. For damaged individuals, trauma treatment is the container, while attachment, resiliency, and brain development are the included ingredients of the NRT process.

== Is NRT an evidence-based practice? ==
On the continuum of [[evidence-based practice]]s and practice-based evidence, the neurological reparative therapy model is in the middle. Causal research has limitations when it comes to isolating [[Variable and attribute (research)|variables]] in an intervention with integrated components. NRT allows for the use of any and all evidence-based practices as the vehicle of treatment, since it does not restrict or specify any therapeutic approach or method. NRT places the responsibility for how the therapeutic process is conducted on the therapist. Evidence-based practices should be a major consideration of all treatment.

== Research ==
Because neurological reparative therapy is an integration of an amalgam of components and a wide range of methods, the limitations of [[causality|causal]] research make it difficult to determine if one ingredient of the process is more significant than any others. NRT primarily relies on the research and literature of the four pillars that form the conceptual foundation of the Model. There is significant literature and research concerning how the human brain functions.&lt;ref name="Hariri"&gt;Hariri A.R. &amp; Holmes A. (2006).

Traumatic Experience and the Brain, a handbook for understanding and treating those traumatized as children, Second Edition.  Phoenix: Acacia Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional research has been conducted on the [[neurobiological]] process of attachment.&lt;ref name="Schore 2001"&gt;Schore, A.  (2001). The effects of a secure attachment relationship on right brain development, affect regulation, and infant mentality.  ''Infant Mental Health Journal, 22'', 210-269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Siegel 2010"&gt;Siegel, D. (2010).  ''Mindsight.''  New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;  The impact of traumatic experience on the brain has abundant literature and research, as well.&lt;ref name="Ziegler TE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;Perry, B.D.

Childhood origins of self-destructive behavior.  ''American Journal of Psychiatry.'' 148, 1665-1671.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of resiliency is built upon a number of skills and attitudes, and has been expanded by the recent interest in psychology with respect to finding out what is ''right'' with individuals rather than what is ''wrong'' with them. The foundation of resiliency is built upon believing in yourself, having personal [[confidence]], being able to connect in a positive way with others, and allowing others to support you. The area of resiliency has strong research support.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, S. L., Nesse, R., Vinokur, A. D., &amp; Smith, D. M. (2003).

''Emotions, Stress, and Health.'' London: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attachment may have the greatest amount of literature developed over the longest period of time.  The early work of [[John Bowlby]], and subsequent work of [[Mary Ainsworth]] and [[Mary Main]], represent the foundations of attachment theory. Research has supported the link between initial attachment of the child and subsequent social success or failure throughout the developmental years and into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Schore 1994"&gt;Schore, A.N.

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2006}}
'''Nominal power''' is a measurement of a [[mediumwave]] [[radio station]]'s output used in the [[United States]].  AM broadcasters are licensed by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to operate at a specific [[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] [[power (physics)|power]], which may be (and usually is) different from the [[transmitter power output]].

* For [[omnidirectional antenna|non-directional]] stations, nominal power is normally equal to the [[Radio frequency|RF]] power presented to the antenna, as determined from the base [[electrical current|current]] and the antenna's nominal [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] at the [[carrier wave|carrier]] frequency.
* For [[directional antenna|directional]] stations, nominal power is normally equal to the RF power at the [[common point]] (the point at which the transmitter output branches off into separate [[phasing network]]s for each tower).

In both cases, nominal power excludes losses in transmission lines between the tower or [[phasor]] and the transmitter; however, it ''includes'' losses in a [[resistor network]] used to decrease the efficiency of the antenna system.

Nominal power is ultimately a historical artifact of the regulatory regime employed by the FCC prior to the 1980s.  In the old system, rather than allowing licensees to choose any power level which would meet the efficiency and [[Interference (communication)|interference]] standards for their class, stations were restricted to a small set of power levels: 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000, 25000, and 50000 [[watt]]s.  A station whose maximum coverage would otherwise be available at 4500 watts (given a specific directional pattern and antenna system efficiency) had a choice of either living with 2500 watts, or reducing the antenna efficiency to a level which would allow for 5 kW.  Newly-constructed stations could fairly easily design an antenna system to meet the requirements, but stations on or moving to a shared tower with higher efficiency had a problem.  The resistor network exception was created to allow stations to reduce their antenna efficiency without having to modify the existing tower.

Rule changes in the 1980s did away with the fixed set of power choices, allowing stations to choose an appropriate power level for their antenna system ("dial-a-power"), so there should no longer be any need for the concept of nominal power.  However, stations still take advantage of the resistor exception in some cases, simply because they perceive the marketing advantage of higher power (or at least "round" power) to be worth the cost of the wasted energy.

A military '''outpost''' is detachment of troops stationed at a distance from the main [[Armed forces|force]] or [[Formation (military)|formation]], usually at a station in a remote or sparsely populated location, positioned to stand guard against unauthorized intrusions and surprise attacks; and the station occupied by such troops, usually a small military base or settlement in an outlying frontier, limit, political boundary or in another country. Outposts can also be called '''miniature military bases''' based on size and number of troops it houses. &lt;ref name="Dictionary meaning: Outpost"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/outpost Dictionary meaning: Outpost]; TheFreeDictionary; An online Dictionary and Thesaurus&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent military use ==
Military outposts, more recently referred to as combat outposts (COPs), served as a cornerstone of counterinsurgency doctrine in Iraq and Afghanistan.  These permanent or semi-permanent structures, often located in or near populated areas, enabled military forces to secure key lines of communication or infrastructure, secure and co-opt the populace, assist the government in restoring essential services, and force insurgents to operate elsewhere. &lt;ref&gt;Seidel, S. B. (2010). ''Planning Combat Outposts to Maximize Population Security''. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a538711.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Combat Outposts were almost unanimously described in positive terms by defense analysts and military officers as a means through which to carry out its counterinsurgency efforts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/journal/docs-temp/138-hsia.pdf|title=A Quick Review of Combat Outposts (COPs)|last=Hsia|first=Timothy|date=2008|website=Small Wars Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performing arts presenters are typically found in three varieties:
*Those attached to a college, university, or other educational institution, with performances usually taking place on campus;
*Those that are an administrative branch of a theater or concert hall, usually presenting performances only in that space;
*Those that are independently administered outside any specific venue, usually renting multiple venues for performances.


The [[Association of Performing Arts Presenters]], located in Washington, D.C., is the largest organizing body of performing arts presenters in the United States. The primary international organizing body of performing arts presenters is the International Society for the Performing Arts.[http://www.ispa.org/]

==Description==
The statue of Prajnaparamita of East Java is probably the most famous depiction of the goddess of transcendental wisdom. The serene expression and meditative pose and gesture suggest peace and wisdom, in contrast with rich and intricate jewelry and decorations. The goddess is in a perfect lotus meditative position called ''vajrasana'' posture, sitting on a double lotus cushion called ''padmasana'' (lotus pedestal) on top of a square base.&lt;ref name="National Museum"/&gt; The statue sits before a carved stela.

The goddess performs ''dharmachakra-mudra'' (the [[mudra]] symbolizing turning the wheel of dharma).&lt;ref name="National Museum"/&gt; Her left arm is placed around an ''utpala'' (blue lotus), on top of which sits her atrribute; the lontar palm leaf book [[Prajnaparamita Sutra]]. The head and face is perfectly chiseled, with downcast eyes and forehead ''urna''. The goddess wears her hair high arranged in ''Jatamakuta'' crown, and behind her head radiates ''prabhamandala'' a halo or aura of light to suggest a divinity that has reached the highest wisdom.&lt;ref name="Siva Buddha"&gt;{{cite book | title = Worshiping Siva and Buddha: The Temple Art of East Java |author1=Ann R. Kinney |author2=Marijke J. Klokke |author3=Lydia Kieven | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | year =2003 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=sfa2FiIERLYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn =9780824827793 |accessdate =17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue was discovered in almost perfect condition in the Cungkup Putri ruins near [[Singhasari temple]], [[Malang]], [[East Java]]. Local tradition links the statue to Queen [[Ken Dedes]] the first queen of Singhasari, probably as a deified portrayal of the queen.&lt;ref name="National Museum"/&gt; Another opinion links the statue with Queen [[Gayatri Rajapatni]], the consort of [[Kertarajasa]] the first king of [[Majapahit]].&lt;ref name ="VCM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author =Drake, Earl| year =2012 |title =Gayatri Rajapatni, Perempuan di Balik Kejayaan Majapahit|publisher = Ombak| location =Yogyakarta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prajnaparamita is a goddess of high standing in Mahayana Tantric Buddhism; she is considered the [[shakti]], or consort, of the highest Buddha in the Buddhist pantheon known as [[Vajradhara]]; she symbolises perfect knowledge.&lt;ref name="National Museum"/&gt;

In the 13th century, the tantric Buddhism gained royal patronage of king [[Kertanegara]] of [[Singhasari]], and thereafter some of Prajnaparamita statues were produced in the region, such as the Prajnaparamita of Singhasari in East Java and Prajnaparamita of [[Muaro Jambi Regency|Jambi]], [[Sumatra]]. Both of East Java and Jambi Prajnaparamitas bear resemblance in style as they were produced in same period, however unfortunately Prajnaparamita of Jambi is headless and was discovered in poor condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Arca Prajnaparamitha | publisher = Balai Pelestaria Cagar Budaya Jambi |url = http://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpcbjambi/2014/08/20/arca-prajnaparamitha/| language = Indonesian |accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the Prajnaparamita of Singhasari was discovered in almost perfect condition. The pristine condition of the statue indicates that it was buried for quite some time. It was found near Candi E, the southernmost structure in the temple complex near [[Singhasari temple]]. The structure is called Candi Wayang or Cungkup Putri by local inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Siva Buddha"/&gt;

The Prajnaparamita of Java was discovered in 1818 or 1819 by D. Monnereau, a [[Dutch East Indies]] official. In 1820 Monnereau gave the statue to C.G.C. Reinwardt, who later brought the statue to the [[Netherlands]], where it became a prized possession of the [[Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde]] in [[Leiden]].&lt;ref name ="VCM"/&gt; For more than 158 years the statue was resided in Leiden, the Netherlands.

In January 1978, the Government of the Netherlands returned the statue to the Republic of Indonesia, when [[Queen Juliana of the Netherlands]] visited the former Dutch colony. Today, the statue is placed in [[National Museum of Indonesia]]. The statue is displayed on 2nd floor Gedung Arca, Indonesian National Museum, [[Jakarta]]. It has become perhaps the best known icon of ancient Indonesian art, as one of the rare images that successfully combines aesthetic perfection and spirituality.&lt;ref name ="egregores"&gt;{{cite web|title =Worshipping the Source: The Buddhist Goddess Prajnaparamita | publisher =egregores| url =https://egregores.wordpress.com/2009/09/25/worshipping-the-source-the-buddhist-goddess-prajnaparamita/|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5938">A '''queue machine''' or '''queue automaton''' is a [[finite state machine]] with the ability to store and retrieve data from an infinite-memory [[queue (data structure)|queue]]. It is a model of computation equivalent to a [[Turing machine]], and therefore it can process the same class of [[formal language]]s.

== Theory ==
A queue machine can be defined as a six-tuple

:&lt;math&gt;M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \$, s, \delta)&lt;/math&gt; where

* &lt;math&gt;\,Q&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of ''states'';
* &lt;math&gt;\,\Sigma \subset \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the finite set of the ''input alphabet'';
* &lt;math&gt;\,\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the finite ''queue alphabet'';
* &lt;math&gt;\,\$ \in \Gamma - \Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the ''initial queue symbol'';
* &lt;math&gt;\,s \in Q&lt;/math&gt; is the ''start state'';
* &lt;math&gt;\,\delta : Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt; is the ''transition function''.

A machine ''configuration'' is an ordered pair of its state and queue contents &lt;math&gt;\,(q,\gamma)\in Q\times\Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\,\Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Kleene closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\,\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. The starting configuration on an input string &lt;math&gt;\,x&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\,(s,x\$)&lt;/math&gt;, and the transition &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow_M^1&lt;/math&gt; from one configuration to the next is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\,(p,A\alpha) \rightarrow_M^1 (q,\alpha\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a symbol from the queue alphabet, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of queue symbols (&lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;(q, \gamma) = \delta(p, A)&lt;/math&gt;. Note the "first-in-first-out" property of the queue in the relation.

The machine accepts a string &lt;math&gt;\,x\in\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; if after a &lt;!---replaced "(possibly infinite)" by opposite property: all automatons (on string sets) I know are allowed only finitely many steps; allowing infinitely many steps would make simulation by Turing machine (see next section) impossible in general---&gt;finite number of transitions the starting configuration evolves to exhaust the string (reaching a null string &lt;math&gt;\,\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;), or &lt;math&gt;\,(s,x\$)\rightarrow_M^*(q,\epsilon).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kozen |first=Dexter C. |editor=David Gries, Fred B. Schneider |title=Automata and Computability |origyear=1951 |type=hardcover |edition=1 |series=Undergraduate Texts in Computer Science |year=1997 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |isbn=0-387-94907-0 |pages=368–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turing completeness ===
We can prove that a queue machine is equivalent to a Turing machine by showing that a queue machine can simulate a Turing machine and vice versa.

A Turing machine can be simulated by a queue machine that keeps a copy of the Turing machine's contents in its queue at all times, with two special markers: one for the TM's head position, and one for the end of the tape; its transitions simulate those of the TM by running through the whole queue, popping off each of its symbols and re-enqueing either the popped symbol, or, near the head position, the equivalent of the TM transition's effect.

A queue machine can be simulated by a Turing machine, but more easily by a [[multi-tape Turing machine]], which is known to be equivalent to a normal single-tape machine.
The simulating queue machine reads input on one tape and stores the queue on the second, with pushes and pops defined by simple transitions to the beginning and end symbols of the tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~rus/Courses/Theory/Notes/turing3.pdf |title=Variants of Turing Machines |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Rus |first=Teodor |work=Lecture Notes Covering Theory of Computation |publisher=University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, 52242-1419 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921051611/http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~rus/Courses/Theory/Notes/turing3.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A formal proof of this is often an exercise in theoretical computer science courses.

'''Roman glass''' objects have been recovered across the [[Roman empire|Roman Empire]] in domestic, industrial and [[funerary]] contexts. [[Glass]] was used primarily for the production of vessels, although mosaic tiles and window glass were also produced. Roman glass production developed from [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] technical traditions, initially concentrating on the production of intensely coloured cast glass vessels. However, during the 1st century AD the industry underwent rapid technical growth that saw the introduction of [[Glassblowing|glass blowing]] and the dominance of colourless or 'aqua' glasses. Production of raw glass was undertaken in geographically separate locations to the working of glass into finished vessels,&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;Fleming, S. J., 1999.

Roman Glassblowing in a Cultural Context. ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 103/3, 441-484.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of the 1st century AD large scale manufacturing resulted in the establishment of glass as a commonly available material in the Roman world, and one which also had technically very difficult specialized types of luxury glass, which must have been very expensive.

==Growth of the Roman glass industry==
[[File:Verre gallo-romain 02.jpg|thumb|right|Roman glass from the 2nd century]]

Despite the growth of [[History of glass|glass working in the Hellenistic World]] and the growing place of glass in [[Archaeological culture|material culture]], at the beginning of the 1st century AD there was still no Latin word for it in the Roman World.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; However, glass was being produced in Roman contexts using primarily [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] techniques and styles (see [[History of glass|glass, history]]) by the late [[Roman Republic|Republican]] period. The majority of manufacturing techniques were time-consuming, and the initial product was a thick-walled vessel which required considerable finishing. This, combined with the cost of importing [[natron]] for the production of raw glass, contributed to the limited use of glass and its position as an expensive and high-status material.

The glass industry was therefore a relatively minor craft during the Republican period; although, during the early decades of the 1st century AD the quantity and diversity of glass vessels available increased dramatically.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; This was a direct result of the massive growth of the Roman influence at the end of the Republican period, the [[Pax romana|Pax Romana]] that followed the decades of civil war,&lt;ref name="Dussart"&gt;Dussart, O., B. Velde, et al., 2004. Glass from Qal'at Sem'an (Northern Syria): The reworking of glass during the transition from Roman to Islamic compositions. ''Journal of Glass Studies'' 46, 67-83.&lt;/ref&gt; and the stabilisation of the state that occurred under [[Augustus]]' rule.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; Still, Roman glasswares were already making their way from [[Western Asia]] (i.e. the [[Parthian Empire]]) to the [[Kushan Empire]] in Afghanistan and India and as far [[Han Dynasty|Han Empire]] of [[China]]. The [[Sino-Roman relations|first Roman glass found in China]] came from [[Economy of the Han Dynasty|an early 1st-century BC tomb]] at [[Guangzhou]], ostensibly via the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;An, Jiayao. (2002).  "When Glass Was Treasured in China," in ''Silk Road Studies VII: Nomads, Traders, and Holy Men Along China's Silk Road'', 79–94. Edited by Annette L. Juliano and Judith A. Lerner. Turnhout: Brepols Publishers. {{ISBN|2-503-52178-9}}. Page 83-84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, Patricia. (1999). ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-66991-X}}. Page 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this a major new technique in glass production had been introduced during the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Allen98"&gt;Allen, D., 1998. ''Roman Glass in Britain''. Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, Shire Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glassblowing]] allowed glass workers to produce vessels with considerably thinner walls, decreasing the amount of glass needed for each vessel. Glass blowing was also considerably quicker than other techniques, and vessels required considerably less finishing, representing a further saving in time, raw material and equipment. Although earlier techniques dominated during the early Augustan and [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]] periods,&lt;ref name="Grose"&gt;Grose, D. F., 1991. Early Imperial Roman cast glass: The translucent coloured and colourless fine wares. ''Roman Glass: two centuries of art and invention''. M. Newby and K. Painter. London: Society of Antiquaries of London.&lt;/ref&gt; by the middle to late 1st century AD earlier techniques had been largely abandoned in favour of blowing.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;

As a result of these factors, the cost of production was reduced and glass became available for a wider section of society in a growing variety of forms. By the mid-1st century AD this meant that glass vessels had moved from a valuable, high-status commodity, to a material commonly available: "a [glass] drinking cup could be bought for a copper coin" (Strabo, [[Geographica]] XVI.2). This growth also saw the production of the first glass [[tesserae]] for mosaics, and the first window glass,&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; as furnace technology improved allowing molten glass to be produced for the first time.&lt;ref name="Stern95"&gt;Stern, E. M., 1995. ''Roman Mould-blown Glass''. Rome, Italy, L'Erma di Fretshneidur in association with the Toledo Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the expansion of the empire also brought an influx of people and an expansion of cultural influences that resulted in the adoption of eastern decorative styles.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; The changes that took place in the Roman glass industry during this period can therefore be seen as a result of three primary influences: historical events, technical innovation and contemporary fashions.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; They are also linked to the fashions and technologies developed in the ceramic trade, from which a number of forms and techniques were drawn.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;

[[File:Green glass Roman cup unearthed at Eastern Han tomb, Guixian, China.jpg|thumb|Green Roman glass cup unearthed from an [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (25-220 AD) tomb, [[Guangxi]], China]]
Glass making reached its peak at the beginning of the 2nd century AD, with glass objects in domestic contexts of every kind.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; The primary production techniques of blowing, and to a lesser extent casting, remained in use for the rest of the Roman period, with changes in vessel types but little change in technology.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; From the 2nd century onwards styles became increasingly regionalised,&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; and evidence indicates that bottles and closed vessels such as unguentaria moved as a by-product of the trade in their contents, and many appear to have matched the Roman scale of liquid measurement.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; The use of coloured glass as a decorative addition to pale and colourless glasses also increased, and metal vessels continued to influence the shape of glass vessels.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; After the conversion of Constantine, glass works began to move more quickly from depicting Pagan religious imagery towards Christian religious imagery. The movement of the capital to [[Constantinople]] rejuvenated the Eastern glass industry, and the presence of the [[Roman legion|Roman military]] in the western provinces did much to prevent any downturn there.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; By the mid-4th century mould-blowing was in use only sporadically.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;

==Production==

===Composition===
{{Main|Glass}}
[[Image:Third beach sand.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Close-up of beach sand, the main component of Roman glass]]
Roman glass production relied on the application of heat to fuse two primary ingredients: silica and soda.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; Technical studies of archaeological glasses divide the ingredients of glass as formers, fluxes, stabilisers, as well as possible opacifiers or colourants.
*'''Former:''' The major component of the glass is silica, which during the Roman period was [[sand]] (quartz), which contains some [[alumina]] (typically 2.5%) and nearly 8% [[lime (material)|lime]].&lt;ref name="Dussart" /&gt; Alumina contents vary, peaking around 3% in glasses from the [[Western Roman Empire|western Empire]], and remaining notably lower in glasses from the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Dussart" /&gt;
*'''Flux:''' This ingredient was used to lower the [[melting point]] of the silica to form glass. Analysis of Roman glass has shown that soda ([[sodium carbonate]]) was used exclusively in glass production.&lt;ref name ="Stern90"&gt;Stern, W. B., 1990. The composition of Roman glass. ''Annales du 11e Congres''. Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the primary source of soda was [[natron]], a naturally occurring salt found in dry lake beds. The main source of natron during the Roman period was [[Wadi El Natrun]], Egypt, although there may have been a source in Italy.
*'''Stabiliser:''' Glasses formed of silica and soda are naturally soluble, and require the addition of a stabiliser such as lime or magnesia. Lime was the primary stabiliser in use during the Roman period, entering the glass through [[calcareous]] particles in the beach sand, rather than as a separate component.&lt;ref name="Freestone06"/&gt;

Roman glass has also been shown to contain around 1% to 2% chlorine, in contrast to later glasses.&lt;ref name ="Stern90" /&gt; This is thought to have originated either in the addition of salt (NaCl) to reduce the melting temperature and viscosity of the glass, or as a contaminant in the natron.

===Glass making===
[[File:Urna cineraria romana de vidrio (M.A.N. Inv.1990-69-150) 01.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Roman blown-glass [[cinerary urn]], dated between 1st and 3rd centuries AD]]

Archaeological evidence for glass making during the Roman period is scarce, but by drawing comparisons with the later [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic]] and [[Byzantine glass|Byzantine]] periods, it is clear that glass making was a significant industry. By the end of the Roman period glass was being produced in large quantities contained in tanks situated inside highly specialised furnaces, as the 8-tonne glass slab recovered from [[Bet She'arim#Glassmaking industry|Bet She'arim]] illustrates.&lt;ref name="Freestone06"/&gt; These workshops could produce many tonnes of raw glass in a single furnace firing, and although this firing might have taken weeks, a single primary workshop could potentially supply multiple secondary glass working sites. It is therefore thought that raw glass production was centred around a relatively small number of workshops,&lt;ref name="Freestone06"/&gt; where glass was produced on a large scale and then broken into chunks.&lt;ref name="Freestone2002"&gt;Freestone, I. C., M. Ponting, Hughes, M.J.,2002. Origins of Byzantine glass from Maroni Petrera, Cyprus. ''Archaeometry'' 44, 257-272.&lt;/ref&gt; There is only limited evidence for local glass making, and only in context of window glass.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; The development of this large-scale industry is not fully understood, but [[Pliny's Natural History]] (36, 194), in addition to evidence for the first use of molten glass in the mid-1st century AD,&lt;ref name="Stern95" /&gt; indicates that furnace technologies experienced marked development during the early-to-mid-1st century AD, in tandem with the expansion of glass production.

The siting of glass-making workshops was governed by three primary factors: the availability of fuel which was needed in large quantities, sources of sand which represented the major constituent of the glass, and natron to act as a flux. Roman glass relied on natron from Wadi El Natrun, and as a result it is thought that glass-making workshops during the Roman period may have been confined to near-coastal regions of the eastern [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name="Freestone06"/&gt; This facilitated the trade in the raw colourless or naturally coloured glass which they produced, which reached glass-working sites across the Roman empire.&lt;ref name="Freestone06" /&gt;

The scarcity of archaeological evidence for Roman glass-making facilities has resulted in the use of chemical compositions as evidence for production models,&lt;ref name="Baxter06" /&gt; as the division of production indicates that any variation is related to differences in raw glass making.&lt;ref name="Freestone06"/&gt; However, the Roman reliance on natron from Wadi El Natrun as a flux,&lt;ref name ="Jackson"&gt;Jackson, C. M., H. E. M. Cool, Wager, E.C.W., 1998. The manufacture of glass in Roman York. ''Journal of Glass Studies'' 40, 55-61.&lt;/ref&gt; has resulted in a largely homogenous composition in the majority of Roman glasses.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Velde"&gt;Velde, B., Year. Observations on the chemical compositions of several types of Gallo-Roman and Frankish glass production.

''Glass Making in the Greco-Roman World, Results of the ARCHGLASS Project'', Leuven University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and although there is some variation in Roman glass compositions, meaningful compositional groups have been difficult to establish for this period.&lt;ref name="Freestone06"&gt;Freestone, I.

===Recycling===

The Roman writers [[Statius]] and [[Martial]] both indicate that recycling broken glass was an important part of the glass industry, and this seems to be supported by the fact that only rarely are glass fragments of any size recovered from domestic sites of this period.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; In the western empire there is evidence that recycling of broken glass was frequent and extensive(cullet),&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Velde" /&gt; and that quantities of broken glassware were concentrated at local sites prior to melting back into raw glass.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; Compositionally, repeated recycling is visible via elevated levels of those metals used as colourants.&lt;ref name="Freestone05"&gt;Freestone, I. C., 2005. The provenance of ancient glass through compositional analysis. ''Materials Issues in Art and Archaeology 7''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Melting does not appear to have taken place in crucibles; rather, cooking pots appear to have been used for small scale operations. For larger work, large tanks or tank-like ceramic containers were utilised. In the largest cases, large furnaces were built to surround these tanks.

===Glass working===
In comparison to glass making, there is evidence for glass working in many locations across the empire. Unlike the making process, the working of glass required significantly lower temperatures and substantially less fuel. As a result of this and the expansion of the Empire, glass working sites developed in Rome, Campania and the Po Valley&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; by the end of the 1st century BC, producing the new blown vessels alongside cast vessels. Italy is known to have been a centre for the working and export of brightly coloured vessels at this time,&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;[[Jennifer Price|Price, J.]], 1990. A survey of the Hellenistic and early Roman vessel glass found on the Unexplored Mansion Site at Knossos in Crete. ''Annales du 11e Congres''. Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; with production peaking during the mid-1st century AD.&lt;ref name ="Allen98" /&gt;

By the early-to-mid-1st century AD, the growth of the Empire saw the establishment of glass working sites at locations along trade routes, with Cologne and other Rhineland centres becoming important glass working sites from the Imperial period,&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; and Syrian glass being exported as far as Italy.&lt;ref name="Facchini"/&gt; During this period vessel forms varied between workshops, with areas such as the Rhineland and northern France producing distinctive forms which are not seen further south.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; Growth in the industry continued into the 3rd century AD, when sites at the Colonia Claudia Agrippinensis appear to have experienced significant expansion,&lt;ref name="Caldera"&gt;Caldera de Castro, M. d. P., 1990. Roman glass in southwest Spain. ''Annales du 11e Congres''. Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 3rd and early 4th centuries producers north of the Alps were exporting down to the north of Italy and the transalpine regions.&lt;ref name="Facchini"&gt;Facchini, G. M., 1990. Roman glass in an excavational context: Angere (VA). Annales du 11e Congres. Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass working sites such as those at Aquileia also had an important role in the spread of glassworking traditions&lt;ref name="Caldera" /&gt; and the trade in materials that used hollow glasswares as containers.&lt;ref name="Facchini" /&gt; However, by the 4th&lt;ref name="Caldera" /&gt; and 5th centuries&lt;ref name ="Facchini"/&gt; Italian glass workshops predominate.

===Styles===
[[Image:Roman glass 2nd cent.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Glass vessel from the 2nd century AD, found in [[Bosanski Novi]]]]

The earliest Roman glass follows Hellenistic traditions and uses strongly coloured and 'mosaic' patterned glass. During the late Republican period new highly coloured striped wares with a fusion of dozens of monochrome and lace-work strips were introduced.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; During this period there is some evidence that styles of glass varied geographically, with the translucent coloured fine wares of the early 1st century notably 'western' in origin, whilst the later colourless fine wares are more 'international'.&lt;ref name="Grose" /&gt; These objects also represent the first with a distinctly Roman style unrelated to the Hellenistic casting traditions on which they are based, and are characterised by novel rich colours.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; 'Emerald' green, dark or [[cobalt blue]], a deep blue-green and Persian or 'peacock' blue are most commonly associated with this period, and other colours are very rare.&lt;ref name ="Grose"/&gt; Of these, Emerald green and peacock blue were new colours introduced by the Romano-Italian industry and almost exclusively associated with the production of fine wares.&lt;ref name="Grose" /&gt;

However, during the last thirty years of the 1st century AD there was a marked change in style, with strong colours disappearing rapidly, replaced by 'aqua' and true colourless glasses.&lt;ref name ="Allen98" /&gt; Colourless and 'aqua' glasses had been in use for vessels and some mosaic designs prior to this, but start to dominate the blown glass market at this time.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; The use of strong colours in cast glass died out during this period, with colourless or 'aqua' glasses dominating the last class of cast vessels to be produced in quantity, as mould and free-blowing took over during the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Grose" /&gt;

From around 70 AD colourless glass becomes the predominant material for fine wares, and the cheaper glasses move towards pale shades of blue, green, and yellow.&lt;ref name="Grose" /&gt; Debate continues whether this change in fashion indicates a change in attitude that placed glass as individual material of merit no longer required to imitate precious stones, ceramics, or metal,&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; or whether the shift to colourless glass indicated an attempt to mimic highly prized rock crystal.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; [[Pliny's Natural History]] states that "the most highly valued glass is colourless and transparent, as closely as possible resembling rock crystal" (36, 192), which is thought to support this last position, as is evidence for the persistence of casting as a production technique, which produced the thickly walled vessels necessary to take the pressure of extensive cutting and polishing associated with crystal working.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;

==Vessel production techniques==
[[Image:Portland Vase BM Gem4036 n5.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Portland Vase]], 5-25AD(?) [[cameo glass]].]]

===Core and rod formed vessels===
Artisans used a mass of mud and straw fixed around a metal rod to form a core, and built up a vessel by either dipping the core in liquified glass, or by trailing liquid glass over the core.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; The core was removed after the glass had cooled, and handles, rims and bases were then added. These vessels are characterised by relatively thick walls, bright colours and zigzagging patterns of contrasting colours, and were limited in size to small [[unguent]] or scent containers.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; This early technique continued in popularity during the 1st century BC,&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; despite the earlier introduction of [[slumping|slumped]] and [[glass casting|cast]] vessels.

===Cold-cut vessels===
This technique is related to the origin of glass as a substitute for [[gemstone]]s. By borrowing techniques for stone and [[engraved gems|carved gems]], artisans were able to produce a variety of small containers from blocks of raw glass or thick moulded [[Glass blank|blanks]],&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; including [[cameo glass]] in two or more colours, and [[cage cup]]s (still thought by most scholars to have been decorated by cutting, despite some debate).

===Glass blowing: free and mould blown vessels===
These techniques, which were to dominate the Roman glass working industry after the late 1st century AD, are discussed in detail on the [[glass blowing]] page. Mould-blown glass appears in the second quarter of the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt;

===Other production techniques===
A number of other techniques were in use during the Roman period:

*[[Cage cup|Cage cup production]]
*[[Cameo glass|Cameo glass production]]
*[[Slumping]]
*[[Glass casting|Casting]]

==Decorative techniques==

===''Cast glass'' patterns===
[[File:Ribbed mosaic glass bowl MET DP141529 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Ribbed bowl of mosaic glass in the Metropolitan Museum of Art]]
[[File:Brit Mus 13sept10 brooches etc 046.jpg|thumb|The [[Lycurgus Cup]], a [[dichroic]] (colour-changing) [[cage cup]], lit from behind, with a modern foot and rim.]]
The glass sheets used for slumping could be produced of plain or multicoloured glass, or even formed of 'mosaic' pieces. The production of these objects later developed into the modern [[caneworking]] and [[millefiori]] techniques, but is noticeably different. Six primary patterns of 'mosaic' glass have been identified:&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt;

*'''Floral (millefiori) and spiral patterns:''' This was produced by binding rods of coloured glass together and heating and fusing them into a single piece. These were then cut in cross-section, and the resulting discs could be fused together to create complex patterns. Alternately, two strips of contrasting-coloured glass could be fused together, and then wound round a glass rod whilst still hot to produce a spiral pattern.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; Cross-sections of this were also cut, and could be fused together to form a plate or fused to plain glass.
*'''Marbled and dappled patterns:''' Some of these patterns are clearly formed through the distortion of the original pattern during the [[slumping]] of the glass plate during melting.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt; However, by using spiral and circular patterns of alternating colours producers were also able to deliberately imitate the appearance of natural stones such as [[sardonyx]].&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; This occurs most often on pillar-moulded bowls, which are one of the commonest glass finds on 1st century sites.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt;
*'''Lace patterns:''' Strips of coloured glass were twisted with a contrasting coloured thread of glass before being fused together. This was a popular method in the early period, but appears to have gone out of fashion by the mid-1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt;
*'''Striped patterns:''' Lengths of monochrome and lacework glass were fused together to create vivid striped designs, a technique that developed from the lace pattern technique during the last decades of the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;
The production of multicoloured vessels declined after the mid-1st century, but remained in use for some time after.&lt;ref name="Allen98" /&gt;

===Gold glass===

{{main|Gold glass}}
{{further|List of gold-glass portraits}}
[[Gold sandwich glass]] or gold glass was a technique for fixing a layer of [[gold leaf]] with a design between two fused layers of glass, developed in [[Hellenistic glass]] and revived in the 3rd century.  There are a very fewer larger designs, but the great majority of the around 500 survivals are roundels that are the cut-off bottoms of wine cups or glasses used to mark and decorate graves in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] by pressing them into the mortar. The great majority are 4th century, extending into the 5th century. Most are Christian, but many pagan and a few Jewish; their [[iconography]] has been much studied, although artistically they are relatively unsophisticated.  In contrast, a much smaller group of 3rd century portrait levels are superbly executed, with pigment painted on top of the gold.  The same technique began to be used for gold [[tesserae]] for mosaics in the mid-1st century in Rome, and by the 5th century these had become the standard background for religious mosaics.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, John, ''Early Christian and Byzantine Art'', pp. 25-26, Penguin History of Art (now Yale), 2nd edn. 1979, {{ISBN|0140560335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other decorative techniques===

A number of other techniques were in use during the Roman period, including [[Vitreous enamel#History|enamelling]] and [[Engraving#History and usage|engraving]].

==Tesserase and window glass==

Shards of broken glass or glass rods were being used in mosaics from the Augustan period onwards, but by the beginning of the 1st century small glass tiles, known as [[tesserae]], were being produced specifically for use in mosaics.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; These were usually in shades of yellow, blue or green, and were predominantly used in mosaics laid under fountains or as highlights.

Around the same time the first window panes are thought to have been produced.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; The earliest panes were [[rough cast]] into a wooden frame on top of a layer of sand or stone,&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; but from the late 3rd century onwards window glass was made by the muff process, where a blown cylinder was cut laterally and flattened out to produce a sheet.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;Forbes, R. J., 1966. ''Studies in ancient technology V''. Editors: Leiden, Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3531">In [[domain theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a '''Scott information system''' is a primitive kind of logical [[deductive system]] often used as an alternative way of presenting [[Scott domain]]s.

==Definition==
A '''Scott information system''', ''A'', is an ordered triple &lt;math&gt;(T, Con, \vdash) &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;T \mbox{ is a set of tokens (the basic units of information)} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Con \subseteq \mathcal{P}_f(T) \mbox{ the finite subsets of T}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\vdash \subseteq (Con \setminus \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace)\times T&lt;/math&gt;
satisfying
# &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If } a \in X \in Con\mbox{ then }X \vdash a&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If } X \vdash Y \mbox{ and }Y \vdash a \mbox{, then }X \vdash a&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If }X \vdash a \mbox{ then } X \cup \{ a \} \in Con&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall a \in T : \{ a\} \in Con&lt;/math&gt; 
# &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If }X \in Con \mbox{ and } X^\prime\, \subseteq X \mbox{ then }X^\prime \in Con.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;X \vdash Y&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\forall a \in Y, X \vdash a.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
===Natural numbers===
The return value of a [[μ-recursive function|partial recursive function]], which either returns a natural number or goes into an infinite recursion, can be expressed as a simple Scott information system as follows:
* &lt;math&gt;T := \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Con := \{ \empty \} \cup \{ \{ n \} \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;X \vdash a\mbox{ iff }a \in X.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the result can either be a natural number, represented by the singleton set &lt;math&gt;\{n\}&lt;/math&gt;, or "infinite recursion," represented by &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt;.

Of course, the same construction can be carried out with any other set instead of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Propositional calculus===
The [[propositional calculus]] gives us a very simple Scott information system as follows:

* &lt;math&gt;T := \{ \phi \mid \phi \mbox{ is satisfiable} \}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Con := \{ X \in \mathcal{P}_f(T) \mid X \mbox{ is consistent} \}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;X \vdash a\mbox{ iff }X \vdash a \mbox{ in the propositional calculus}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Scott domains===
Let ''D'' be a [[Scott domain]]. Then we may define an information system as follows

* &lt;math&gt;T := D^0 &lt;/math&gt; the set of [[compact element]]s of D
* &lt;math&gt;Con := \{ X \in \mathcal{P}_f(T) \mid X \mbox{ has an upper bound} \}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;X \vdash d\mbox{ iff }d \sqsubseteq \bigsqcup X.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; be the mapping that takes us from a Scott domain, ''D'', to the information system defined above.

==Information systems and Scott domains==
Given an information system, &lt;math&gt;A = (T, Con, \vdash) &lt;/math&gt;, we can build a [[Scott domain]] as follows. 

* Definition: &lt;math&gt;x \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt; is a point iff
** &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If }X \subseteq_f x \mbox{ then } X \in Con&lt;/math&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If }X \vdash a \mbox{ and } X \subseteq_f x \mbox{ then } a \in x.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}(A)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of points of A with the subset ordering. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}(A)&lt;/math&gt; will be a countably based Scott domain when T is countable. In general, for any Scott domain D and information system A
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{I}(D)) \cong D&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{D}(A)) \cong A&lt;/math&gt;
where the second congruence is given by [[approximable mapping]]s.

A '''seashell''' or '''sea shell''', also known simply as a '''shell''', is a hard, protective outer layer created by an animal that lives in the sea. The shell is part of the body of the animal. Empty seashells are often found washed up on [[beach]]es by [[beachcombing|beachcombers]]. The shells are empty because the animal has died and the soft parts have been eaten by another animal or have [[decomposition|decomposed]].

A seashell is usually the [[exoskeleton]] of an [[invertebrate]] (an animal without a backbone), and is typically composed of [[calcium carbonate]] or [[chitin]]. Most shells that are found on beaches are the shells of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[mollusk]]s, partly because these shells are usually made of calcium carbonate, and endure better than shells made of chitin.

Apart from [[mollusk shell]]s, other shells that can be found on beaches are those of [[barnacle]]s, [[horseshoe crab]]s and [[brachiopod]]s. Marine [[annelid]] worms in the family [[Serpulidae]] create shells which are tubes made of calcium carbonate cemented onto other surfaces. The shells of [[sea urchin]]s are called "[[test (zoology)|test]]s", and the moulted shells of [[crab]]s and [[lobster]]s are [[exuviae]]. While most seashells are external, some [[cephalopods]] have internal shells.

Seashells have been used by humans for many different purposes throughout history and pre-history. However, seashells are not the only kind of shells; in various habitats, there are shells from freshwater animals such as [[freshwater mussel]]s and [[freshwater snail]]s, and shells of [[land snail]]s.

== Terminology ==
When the word "seashells" refers only to the shells of marine mollusks, then studying seashells is part of [[conchology]]. Conchologists or serious collectors who have a scientific bias are in general careful not to disturb living populations and habitats: even though they may collect a few live animals, most responsible collectors do not often over-collect or otherwise disturb ecosystems.

The study of the entire molluscan animal (as well as the shell) is known as [[malacology]]; a person who studies mollusks is known as a [[malacologist]].
[[File:Shells on sand.jpg|thumb|Seashells on the beach]]

== Occurrence ==
Seashells are commonly found in beach drift, which is natural detritus deposited along strandlines on [[beach]]es by the [[wave]]s and the [[tide]]s. Shells are very often washed up onto a beach empty and clean, the animal having already died.

Empty seashells are often picked up by beachcombers. However, the majority of seashells which are offered for sale commercially have been collected alive (often in bulk) and then killed and cleaned, specifically for the commercial trade.{{citation needed|reason=The claim that seashell providers slaughter large populations of animals is a serious accusation. Support is needed.|date=February 2013}} This type of large-scale exploitation can sometimes have a strong negative impact on local [[ecosystem]]s, and sometimes can significantly reduce the distribution of [[rare species]].

[[File:Seashells North Wales 1985.jpg|thumb|Seashells hand-picked from beach drift in [[North Wales]] at [[Shell Island (Wales)|Shell Island]] near [[Harlech Castle]], [[Wales]], [[bivalve]]s and [[gastropod]]s, March/April 1985]]
{{main|Mollusc shell}}

The word ''seashell'' is often used to mean only the shell of a [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[mollusk]]. Marine mollusk shells that are familiar to beachcombers and thus most likely to be called "seashells" are the shells of marine species of [[bivalves]] (or [[clam]]s), [[gastropod]]s (or [[snail]]s), [[scaphopod]]s (or [[tusk shell]]s), [[polyplacophora]]ns (or [[chiton]]s), and [[cephalopod]]s (such as [[nautilus]] and [[spirula]]). These shells are very often the most commonly encountered, both in the wild, and for sale as decorative objects.

Marine species of gastropods and bivalves are more numerous than land and freshwater species, and the shells are often larger and more robust. The shells of marine species also often have more [[sculpture (mollusc)|sculpture]] and more color, although this is  by no means always the case.

In the [[tropical]] and sub-tropical areas of the planet, there are far more species of colorful, large, shallow water shelled marine mollusks than there are in the temperate zones and the regions closer to the poles.

Although there are a number of species of shelled mollusks that are quite large, there are vast numbers of extremely small species too, see [[micromollusk]]s.

Not all mollusks are marine. There are numerous land and freshwater mollusks, see for example [[snail]] and [[freshwater bivalves]]. In addition, not all mollusks have an external shell: some mollusks such as some cephalopods (squid and octopuses) have an internal shell, and many mollusks have no shell, see for example [[slug]] and [[nudibranch]].

=== Bivalves ===
[[File:CoquillagesFadiouth.jpg|thumb|Single valves of the [[bivalve]] ''[[Senilia senilis]]'', plus two [[gastropod]]s, washed up on the beach at [[Fadiouth]], [[Senegal]]]]
Bivalves are often the most common seashells that wash up on large sandy beaches or in sheltered [[lagoon]]s. They can sometimes be extremely numerous. Very often the two [[valve (mollusc)|valves]] become separated.

There are more than 15,000 species of bivalves that live in both marine and freshwater.  Examples of bivalves are clams, scallops, mussels, and oysters. The majority of bivalves consist of two identical shells that are held together by a flexible hinge.  The animal's body is held protectively inside these two shells. Bivalves that do not have two shells either have one shell or they lack a shell altogether. The shells are made of calcium carbonate and are formed in layers by secretions from the mantle. Bivalves, also known as pelecypods, are mostly filter feeders; through their gills, they draw in water, in which is trapped tiny food particles.  Some bivalves have eyes and an open circulatory system.  Bivalves are used all over the world as food and as a source of pearls. The larvae of some freshwater mussels can be dangerous to fish and can bore through wood.

[[Shell Beach, Western Australia]], is a beach which is entirely made up of the shells of the [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]] ''[[Fragum erugatum]]''.

=== Gastropods ===
[[File:Sea shells, playa grande, costa rica.jpg|thumb|Numerous ''[[Turritella]]'' gastropod shells washed up on a beach at [[Playa Grande, Costa Rica]]]]
Certain species of gastropod seashells (the shells of [[sea snail]]s) can sometimes be common, washed up on sandy beaches, and also on beaches that are surrounded by rocky marine habitat.

=== Polyplacophorans ===
[[File:Chiton tuberculatus plates.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Loose valves or plates from ''[[Chiton tuberculatus]]'' from the beachdrift on the southeast coast of [[Nevis]], [[West Indies]]]]
[[Chiton]] plates or valves often wash up on beaches in rocky areas where chitons are common. Chiton shells, which are composed of eight separate plates and a girdle, usually come apart not long after death, so they are almost always found as disarticulated plates. Plates from larger species of chitons are sometimes known as "butterfly shells" because of their shape.

=== Cephalopods ===
[[File:Cuttlebone.jpg|thumb|130px|Cuttlebone from a ''[[Sepia (genus)|Sepia]]'' sp.]]
[[File:Nautilus species shells.png|thumb|130px|Shells of 3 species of ''[[Nautilus]]'']]

Only a few species of [[cephalopod]]s have shells (either internal or external) that are sometimes found washed up on beaches.

Some cephalopods such as ''[[Sepia (genus)|Sepia]]'', the cuttlefish, have a large internal shell, the [[cuttlefish bone]], and this often washes up on beaches in parts of the world where cuttlefish are common.

''[[Spirula spirula]]'' is a deep water squid-like cephalopod. It has an internal shell which is small (about 1 in or 24&amp;nbsp;mm) but very light and buoyant. This chambered shell floats very well and therefore washes up easily and is familiar to beachcombers in the tropics.

''[[Nautilus]]'' is the only genus of cephalopod that has a well-developed external shell. Females of the cephalopod genus ''[[Argonaut (animal)|Argonauta]]'' create a papery egg case which sometimes washes up on tropical beaches and is referred to as a "paper nautilus".

The largest group of shelled cephalopods, the [[ammonite]]s, are extinct, but their shells are very common in certain areas as [[fossil]]s.

=== Molluscan seashells used by other animals ===
Empty molluscan seashells are a sturdy, and usually readily available, "free" resource which is often easily found on beaches, in the [[intertidal zone]], and in the shallow subtidal zone.  As such they are sometimes used [[second-hand]] by animals other than humans for various purposes, including for protection (as in [[hermit crab]]s) and for construction.

==== Mollusks ====
* Carrier shells in the family [[Xenophoridae]] are marine shelled gastropods, fairly large sea snails. Most species of xenophorids cement a series of objects to the rim of their shells as they grow. These objects are sometimes small pebbles or other hard detritus. Very often shells of bivalves or smaller gastropods are used, depending on what is available on the particular [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] where the snail itself lives. It is not clear whether these shell attachments serve as [[camouflage]], or whether they are intended to help prevent the shell sinking into a soft substrate.

[[File:Ocellated octopus.jpg|thumb|left|An ocellated (spotted) octopus using a clamshell as a shelter]]
* Small [[octopus]]es sometimes use an empty shell as a sort of cave to hide in, or hold seashells around themselves as a form of protection like a temporary fortress.

==== Invertebrates ====
[[File:Diogenes pugilator.jpg|thumb|Marine [[hermit crab]] ''[[Diogenes pugilator]]'', using a shell of the dog whelk ''[[Nassarius reticulatus]]'']]
* Almost all genera of [[hermit crab]]s use or "wear" empty marine gastropod shells throughout their lifespan, in order to protect their soft abdomens, and in order to have a strong shell to withdraw into if attacked by a predator. Each individual hermit crab is forced to find another gastropod shell on a regular basis, whenever it grows too large for the one it is currently using.

:Some hermit crab species live on land and may be found quite some distance from the sea, including those in the tropical genus ''[[Coenobita]]''.

=== Conchology ===
{{main|Conchology}}

There are numerous popular books and [[field guide]]s on the subject of shell-collecting. Although there are a number of books about land and freshwater mollusks, the majority of popular books emphasize, or focus exclusively on, the shells of marine mollusks. Both the science of studying mollusk shells and the hobby of collecting and classifying them are known as [[conchology]]. The line between professionals and amateur enthusiasts is often not well defined in this subject, because many amateurs have contributed to, and continue to contribute to, conchology and the larger science of [[malacology]]. Many shell collectors belong to "shell clubs" where they can meet others who share their interests. A large number of amateurs collect the shells of marine mollusks, and this is partly because many shells wash up empty on beaches, or live in the [[intertidal]] or sub-tidal zones, and are therefore easily found and preserved without much in the way of specialized equipment or expensive supplies. Some shell collectors find their own material and keep careful records, or buy only "specimen shells", which means shells which have full collecting [[data]]: information including how, when, where, in what habitat, and by whom, the shells were collected. On the other hand, some collectors buy the more widely available commercially imported exotic shells, the majority of which have very little data, or none at all. To [[museum]] scientists, having full collecting data (when, where, and by whom it was collected) with a specimen is far more important than having the shell correctly identified. Some owners of shell collections hope to be able to donate their collection to a major natural history or zoology museum at some point, however, shells with little or no collecting data are usually of no value to science, and are likely not to be accepted by a major museum. Apart from any damage to the shell that may have happened ''before'' it was collected, shells can also suffer damage when they are stored or displayed. For an example of one rather serious kind of damage see [[Byne's disease]].

==== Shell clubs ====
There are a number of clubs or societies which consist of people who are united by a shared interest in shells. In the US, these clubs are more common in southerly coastal areas, such as [[Florida]] and [[California]], where the marine fauna is rich in species.

==== Identification ====
Seashells are usually identified by consulting general or regional shell-collecting [[field guide]]s, and specific scientific books on different taxa of shell-bearing mollusks ([[monograph]]s) or "iconographies" (limited text - mainly photographs or other illustrations). (For a few titles on this subject in the US, see the list of books at the foot of this article.) Identifications to the species level are generally achieved by examining illustrations and written descriptions, rather than by the use of [[Identification key]]s, as is often the case in identifying plants and other phyla of invertebrates. The construction of functional keys for the identification of the shells of marine mollusks to the species level can be very difficult, because of the great variability within many species and families. The identification of certain individual species is often very difficult, even for a specialist in that particular family. Some species cannot be differentiated on the basis of shell character alone.

Numerous smaller and more obscure mollusk species (see [[micromollusk]]) are yet to be discovered and named. In other words, they have not yet been differentiated from similar species and assigned scientific (binomial) names in articles in journals recognized by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN). Large numbers of new species are published in the scientific literature each year. There are currently an estimated 100,000 species of mollusks worldwide.

==== Non-marine "seashells" ====
[[File:Shells01.jpg|thumb|A group of purchased (mostly marine) shells includes the shell of a large tropical land snail (upper right), and a shiny freshwater apple snail shell (center)]]

The term ''seashell'' is also applied loosely to mollusk shells that are not of marine origin, for example by people walking the shores of lakes and rivers using the term for the [[freshwater mollusc|freshwater mollusk]] shells they encounter.  Seashells purchased from tourist shops or dealers may include various freshwater and terrestrial shells as well.  Non-marine items offered may include large and colorful tropical [[snail|land snail]] shells, freshwater [[apple snail]] shells, and pearly freshwater [[unionid mussel]] shells.  This can be confusing to collectors, as non-marine shells are often not included in their reference books.

==== Currency ====
{{main|shell money}}

Seashells have been used as a medium of exchange in various places, including many Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean islands, also in North America, Africa and the Caribbean.
[[Image:Cypraea-moneta-001.jpg|thumb|1742 drawing of shells of the money cowry, ''[[Monetaria moneta]]'']]
* The most common species of shells to be used as currency have been ''[[Monetaria moneta]]'', the "money [[cowry]]",&lt;ref name="Poutiers"&gt;Poutiers, J. M. (1998).

* Many of the tribes and nations all across the continent of Africa have historically used the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160323070635/http://www.blackhistorypages.net/pages/cowrie.php cowry] as their media of exchange. The cowry circulated, historically, alongside metal coins and goods, and foreign currencies. Being durable and easy to carry the cowry made a very favorable currency.
* Some tribes of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] used shells for [[wampum]] and [[hair pipe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[John C. Ewers|Ewers, John C.]] "[http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/BAE/Bulletin164/section2.htm#Shell%20hp Hair Pipes in Plains Indian Adornment]", ''Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 164'', pp. 29-85.  United States Government Printing Office, Washington : 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; The Native American ''[[wampum]] belts'' were made of the shell of the [[quahog]] clam.

==== Tools ====
Seashells have often been used as [[tool]]s, because of their strength and the variety of their shapes.
* [[Giant clam]]s (Family Tridacnidae) have been used as bowls, and when big enough, even as bathtubs and [[baptism]]al fonts.
* ''[[Melo melo]]'', the "bailer [[Volutidae|volute]]", is so named because Native Australians used it to bail out their canoes.
* Many different species of bivalves have been used as scrapers, blades, clasps, and other such tools, due to their shape.
* Some marine gastropods have been used for [[oil lamp]]s, the oil being poured in the aperture of the shell, and the [[siphonal canal]] serving as a holder for the wick.

==== Horticulture ====
Because seashells are in some areas a readily available bulk source of calcium carbonate, shells such as [[oyster]] shells are sometimes used as soil conditioners in [[horticulture]]. The shells are broken or ground into small pieces in order to have the desired effect of raising the [[pH]] and increasing the [[calcium]] content in the soil.

==== Religion and spirituality ====

Seashells have played a part in religion and spirituality, sometimes even as ritual objects.
* In Christianity, the [[scallop]] shell is considered to be the symbol of [[Saint James the Great]], see ''[[Pecten jacobaeus]]''.
* In [[Hinduism]], left-handed shells of ''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'' (the sacred [[shankha]]) are considered to be sacred to the god [[Vishnu]]. The person who finds a left-handed chank shell (one that coils to the left) is sacred to Vishnu, as well. The chank shell also plays an important role in [[Buddhism]].
* [[Cowries]] have often been considered to be symbols of female fertility. They were often treated as actual fertility [[amulet|charms]]. The dorsum of the shell resembles a pregnant belly, and the underside of the shell resembles a [[vulva]]. In the South Indian state of Kerala, cowries are used for making astrological predictions.
* In the [[Santería]] religion, shells are used for [[divination]].
* The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture of ancient [[Peru]] worshipped animals and the sea, and often depicted shells in their art.&lt;ref&gt;Berrin, Katherine &amp; Larco Museum. ''The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the [[Larco Museum|Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera]].'' New York: [[Thames and Hudson]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Christianity, the top  of the [[sand dollar]] represents the Star of Bethlehem that led the Wise Men to the manger of Christ. Outside the "star" you will see the Easter Lily, a sign of Jesus' Resurrection. There are four holes that represent the holes in the Lord's hands and feet. The center hole is the Wound to His Sacred Heart by the spear of Longinus. On the other side of the sand dollar, you will see Poinsettia. Lastly, if you break open the sand dollar, five doves will come out, the doves of Peace and Joy.&lt;ref&gt;The Legend of the Sand Dollar&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Musical instruments ====
{{main|Conch (musical instrument)}}

[[File:Gyeonbokgung-March-01.jpg|thumb|Korean military procession with ''[[Charonia]]'' trumpets]]

Seashells have been used as musical instruments, [[wind instruments]] for many hundreds if not thousands of years. Most often the shells of large sea snails are used, as trumpets, by cutting a hole in the [[spire (mollusc)|spire]] of the shell or cutting off the tip of the spire altogether. Various different kinds of large marine gastropod shells can be turned into "blowing shells", however the most commonly encountered species used as "[[conch]]" trumpets are:
* The sacred chank, ''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'', known in India as the [[shankha]]. In [[Tibet]] it is known as "dung-dkar".&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/shells.html |title=Some Basics on Shell Trumpets and some very Basics on how to make them |author=Clark, Mitchell |year=1996 |publisher=furious.com |accessdate=24 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021010404/http://www.furious.com/perfect/shells.html |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Triton (mollusk)|Triton shell]] also known as "Triton's trumpet" ''[[Charonia tritonis]]'' which is used as a trumpet in Melanesian and Polynesian culture and also in [[Korea]] and Japan. In Japan this kind of trumpet is known as the [[horagai]]. In Korea it is known as the [[nagak]]. In some Polynesian islands it is known as "''pu''".&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;
* The [[Queen Conch]] ''[[Strombus gigas]]'', has been used as a trumpet in the Caribbean.

Children in some cultures are often told the myth that you can hear the sound of the ocean by holding a seashell to ones ear. This is due to the effect of [[seashell resonance]].

==== Personal adornment ====
[[File:Kikuyu woman traditional dress.jpg|thumb|Use of [[gastropod shell]]s, specifically [[cowries]], in traditional dress of the [[Kikuyu people]] of [[Kenya]], Africa]]
[[File:Pearlykingandqueen.jpg|right|thumb|A Pearly King and Queen in London]]
Whole seashells or parts of sea shells have been used as jewelry or in other forms of adornment since prehistoric times. [[Mother of pearl]] was historically primarily a seashell product, although more recently some mother of pearl comes from freshwater mussels. Also see [[pearl]].
* Shell necklaces have been found in Stone Age graves as far inland as the [[Dordogne]] Valley in France.
* Seashells are often used whole and drilled, so that they can be threaded like [[bead]]s, or cut into pieces of various shapes. Sometimes shells can be found that are already "drilled" by predatory snails of the family [[Naticidae]]. Fine whole shell necklaces were made by [[Tasmanian Aboriginal]] women for more than 2,600 years. The necklaces represent a significant cultural tradition which is still practised by [[Tasmanian Aboriginal|Palawa]] women elders. The shells used include pearly green and blue-green maireener (rainbow kelp) shells, brown and white rice shells, black cats' teeth shells and pink button shells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/dulcie_greeno_necklaces Tasmanian Aboriginal shell necklaces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612010907/http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/dulcie_greeno_necklaces/ |date=12 June 2011 }}, [[National Museum of Australia]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Naturally-occurring, beachworn, [[cone shell]] "tops" (the broken-off spire of the shell, which often has a hole worn at the tip) can function as beads without any further modification. In [[Hawaii]] these natural beads were traditionally collected from the beach drift in order to make [[puka shell]] jewelry. Since it is hard to obtain large quantities of naturally-occurring beachworn cone tops, almost all modern puka [[shell jewelry]] uses cheaper imitations, cut from thin shells of other species of mollusk, or even made of plastic.
* Shells historically have been and still are made into, or incorporated into, necklaces, pendants, beads, earrings, [[button (clothing)|buttons]], [[brooch]]es, [[ring (finger)|rings]], [[comb|hair combs]], belt buckles and other uses.
* The shell of the large  "bullmouth helmet" sea snail, scientific name ''[[Cypraecassis rufa]]'', was historically, and still is, used to make valuable [[Cameo (carving)|cameos]].
* [[Nacre|Mother of pearl]] from many seashells including species in the family [[Trochidae]], [[Turbinidae]], [[Haliotidae]], and various pearly bivalves, has often been used in jewelry, buttons, etc.
* In London, [[Pearly Kings and Queens]] traditionally wear clothing covered in patterns made up of hundreds of "pearl [[Button (clothing)|buttons]]", in other words, buttons made of [[mother-of-pearl]] or [[nacre]]. In recent years however, the majority of "pearl buttons" are imitations that are made of pearlescent plastic.

==== Crafts ====
{{main|Sailor's Valentines}}

"[[Sailor's Valentines]]" were late 19th-century decorative keepsakes which were made in the Caribbean, and which were often purchased by sailors to give to their loved ones back home for example in England. These valentines consisted of elaborate arrangements of small seashells glued into attractive symmetrical designs, which were encased on a wooden (usually octagonal) hinged box-frame. The patterns used often featured heart-shaped designs, or included a sentimental expression of love spelled out in small shells.

The making of shellwork artifacts is a practice of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal women]] from [[La Perouse, New South Wales|La Perouse]] in [[Sydney]], dating back to the 19th century. Shellwork objects include baby shoes, jewelry boxes and replicas of famous landmarks, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] and the [[Sydney Opera House]]. The shellwork tradition began as an Aboriginal women's craft which was adapted and tailored to suit the tourist souvenir market, and which is now considered high art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/shell_work_sydney_harbour_bridge/ Shellwork Sydney Harbour Bridge, National Museum of Australia Collections, accessed 18 April 201.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317131323/http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/shell_work_sydney_harbour_bridge/ |date=17 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Architectural decoration ====
Small pieces of colored and iridescent shell have been used to create [[mosaic]]s and [[inlay]]s, which have been used to decorate walls, furniture and boxes. Large numbers of whole seashells, arranged to form patterns, have been used to decorate mirror frames, furniture and man-made [[grotto]]s.

==== Art ====

A very large outdoor sculpture at [[Akkulam]] of a gastropod seashell is a reference to the sacred chank shell ''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'' of India. In 2003, [[Maggi Hambling]] designed a striking 13&amp;nbsp;ft (4 m) high sculpture of a [[scallop]] shell which stands on the beach at [[Aldeburgh]], in England. The goddess of love, [[Venus]] or [[Aphrodite]] is often traditionally depicted rising from the sea on a seashell.  In ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'', [[Botticelli]] depicted the goddess [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] rising from the ocean on a [[scallop]] shell.

==== Poultry feeds ====
Sea shells found in the creek and backwater of the coast of west India are used as an additive to poultry feed. They are crushed and mixed with jawar maaze and dry fish.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

{{anchor|shellcrete}} Along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], [[oyster]] shells were mixed into [[cement]] to make "shellcrete" ([[portmanteau]] of ''shell'' and ''concrete''), which could form bricks, blocks and platforms. It could also be applied over logs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Preservation News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_aYaAQAAMAAJ|year=1985|publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation in the United States.|page=94|quote= Brittle buildings made of "shellcrete," a seashell-cement mix applied over logs, are risky to move.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example is the 19th-century [[Sabine Pass Lighthouse]] in Louisiana, near Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tunnell|first=John Wesley|title=Encyclopedia of Texas Seashells|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PIkC-rU2NkoC&amp;pg=PA17|year=2010|publisher=Texas A&amp;M U.

== Shells of other marine invertebrates ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
=== Arthropods ===
[[File:Crab from Long Island.jpg|thumb|The moulted [[carapace]] of a [[lady crab]] found on the beach at [[Long Beach, New York|Long Beach, Long Island, New York State]]]]
[[File:Horseshoe Crab remains.jpg|thumb|left|Shell of [[horseshoe crab]] on a beach]]

Many [[arthropod]]s have [[sclerite]]s, or hardened body parts, which form a stiff exoskeleton made up mostly of [[chitin]].  In [[crustacean]]s, especially those of the class [[Malacostraca]] (crabs, shrimps and lobsters, for instance), the plates of the exoskeleton may be fused to form a more or less rigid [[carapace]]. Moulted carapaces of a variety of marine malacostraceans often wash up on beaches. The [[horseshoe crab]] is an arthropod of the family [[Limulidae]]. The shells or [[exuviae]] of these arachnid relatives are common in beach drift in certain areas of the world.

=== Sea urchins ===
[[File:Sea Urchin test 5629 03 22.jpg|thumb|[[Sea urchin]] test]]
Some [[echinoderm]]s such as [[sea urchin]]s, including [[heart urchin]]s and [[sand dollar]]s, have a hard "test" or shell. After the animal dies, the flesh rots out and the spines fall off, and then fairly often the empty test washes up whole onto a beach, where it can be found by a beachcomber. These tests are fragile and easily broken into pieces.

=== Brachiopods ===
[[File:LingulaanatinaAA.JPG|thumb|A whole animal of the brachiopod ''[[Lingula anatina]]'' from Australia with the shell showing on the left]]
The [[brachiopod]]s, or lamp shells, superficially resemble clams, but the phylum is not closely related to mollusks. Most lines of brachiopods ended during the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]], and their ecological niche was filled by bivalves. A few of the remaining species of brachiopods occur in the low [[intertidal zone]] and thus can be found live by beachcombers.

=== Annelids ===
Some [[polychaetes]], marine annelid worms in the family [[Serpulidae]], secrete a hard tube made of calcium carbonate, adhering to stones or other shells. This tube resembles, and can be confused with, the shell of marine gastropod mollusks in the family [[Vermetidae]], the worm snails.

== Other more atypical kinds ==
A few other categories of marine animals leave remains which might be considered "seashells" in the widest possible sense of the word.

=== Chelonians ===
[[Sea turtle]]s have a [[carapace]] and [[plastron]] of bone and [[cartilage]] which is developed from their [[rib]]s. Infrequently a turtle "shell" will wash up on a beach.

=== Hard corals ===
[[Image:Shells stones and other curios.JPG|thumb|Dish with beachworn coral pieces, marine gastropod shells, and echinoderm tests, from the Caribbean and the Mediterranean]]

Pieces of the hard skeleton of [[coral]]s commonly wash up on beaches in areas where corals grow.

The construction of the shell-like structures of corals are aided by a [[symbiotic]] relationship with a class of [[algae]], [[zooxanthella]]e. Typically a coral polyp will harbor particular species of algae, which will [[photosynthesis]]e and thereby provide energy for the coral and aid in calcification,&lt;ref name=MilneBay&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; while living in a safe environment and using the carbon dioxide and nitrogenous waste produced by the polyp.  [[Coral bleaching]] is a disruption of the balance between polyps and algae, and can lead to the breakdown and death of coral reefs.

=== Soft corals ===
[[File:1-Gorgone.jpg|thumb|An x-ray photograph of a [[gorgonian]]]]
The skeletons of soft corals such as [[gorgonian]]s, also known as [[sea fan]]s and [[sea whip]]s, commonly wash ashore in the [[tropics]] after storms.

=== Plankton and protists ===
[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|Marine [[diatom]]s form hard silicate shells]]
Plant-like [[diatom]]s and animal-like [[radiolarian]]s are two forms of [[plankton]] which form hard [[silica]]te shells. [[Foraminifera]] and [[coccolithophore]] create shells known as "[[test (biology)|tests]]" which are made of calcium carbonate. These shells and tests are usually microscopic in size, though in the case of foraminifera, they are sometimes visible to the naked eye, often resembling miniature mollusk shells.

They proposed a cytochemical assay based on production of a blue-dyed precipitate that results from the cleavage of the chromogenic substrate [[X-Gal]], which stains blue when cleaved by galactosidase. Since then, even more specific quantitative assays were developed for its detection at pH 6.0.&lt;ref name="pmid17920029"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bassaneze V, Miyakawa AA, Krieger JE | title = A quantitative chemiluminescent method for studying replicative and stress-induced premature senescence in cell cultures | journal = Anal.

[[Sex]] and the use of [[drug]]s (legal and illegal) have been linked throughout human history, encompassing all aspects of sex: [[desire]], [[performance improvement|performance]], [[pleasure]], [[fertilisation|conception]], [[gestation]], and [[disease]].

== Disinhibition ==
Drugs are frequently associated with reduced sexual inhibition, both when used voluntarily in social circumstances, and involuntarily, as in the case of some [[date rape drug]]s.

Because the use of drugs, including [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], is commonly presented as an excuse for risky or socially unacceptable behaviour, it is necessary to treat the idea of a direct causal relation between drug use and [[unsafe sex]] with caution.  Drugs may provide a socially acceptable excuse for engaging in sexual behaviours in which people may want to engage but perhaps feel that they should not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Race|first1=Kane|title=Pleasure Consuming Medicine: The Queer Politics of Drugs|date=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822390884|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkVuU9KmotYC&amp;&amp;pg=PA176|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual function ==
Some forms of sexual dysfunction such as [[erectile dysfunction]] can be treated with drugs. Because of their effects, erectile dysfunction drugs are sometimes used for recreational purposes.

Many [[drug]]s, both legal and illegal, some sold online, have side effects that affect the user's sexual function. Many drugs can cause [[loss of libido]] as a side effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=JR|last2=Ratamess|first2=NA|title=Medical issues associated with anabolic steroid use: are they exaggerated?|journal=Journal of sports science &amp; medicine|date=2006|volume=5|issue=2|pages=182-93|pmid=24259990|pmc=3827559}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url= https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-male-enhancement-products-deliver-more-you-bargained-f1C8993189 | title = FDA: ‘Male enhancement’ products deliver more than you bargained for | publisher = NBC News | date  = 21 March 2013| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the partial cause of the [[Refractory period (sex)|refractory period]] is the inhibition of [[dopamine]] by an orgasm-induced [[secretion]] of [[prolactin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Krüger TH, Haake P, Haverkamp J, etal | title = Effects of acute prolactin manipulation on sexual drive and function in males | journal = [[Journal of Endocrinology]] | volume = 179 | issue = 3 | pages = 357–65 |date=December 2003 | pmid = 14656205 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.1790357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such potent [[dopamine receptor]] [[agonist]]s as [[cabergoline]] may help achieve multiple [[orgasm]]s as well as the retention of sexual arousal for longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krüger TH, Haake P, Haverkamp J, etal | title = Effects of acute prolactin manipulation on sexual drive and function in males | journal = [[Journal of Endocrinology]] | volume = 179 | issue = 3 | pages = 357–65 |date=December 2003 | pmid = 14656205 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.1790357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contraception and abortion == 
Drug-based contraception has been available since the development of the [[contraceptive pill]]. As well as their contraceptive effects, contraceptive drugs can also have adverse sexual and reproductive side-effects. Prior to the availability of effective contraceptives, some substances were also used as [[abortifacient]]s to terminate pregnancy; [[medical abortion]] exists as a modern medical practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8295">'''Slow reading''' is the intentional reduction in the speed of [[reading (process)|reading]], carried out to increase comprehension or pleasure. The concept appears to have originated in the study of [[philosophy]] and [[literature]] as a technique to more fully comprehend and appreciate a complex [[Text (literary theory)|text]]. More recently, there has been increased interest in slow reading as result of the [[Slow movement (culture)|slow movement]] and its focus on decelerating the pace of modern life. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Related terms ==

The use of slow reading in literary criticism is sometimes referred to as [[close reading]]. Of less common usage is the term, "deep reading".&lt;ref name=Birkerts1994 &gt;Birkerts, Sven. (1994). ''The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age''. Boston: Faber and Faber.  [http://archives.obs-us.com/obs/english/books/nn/bdbirk.htm Selected passages], Open Book Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; Slow reading is contrasted with [[speed reading]] which involves techniques to increase the rate of reading without adversely affecting comprehension, and contrasted with [[Skimming (reading)|skimming]]  which employs visual page cues to increase reading speed. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Philosophy and literature ==

The earliest reference to slow reading appears to be in [[Nietzsche]]'s  preface to the 1887 ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'': "It is not for nothing that one has been a [[Philology|philologist]], perhaps one is a philologist still, that is to say, a teacher of slow reading."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Nietzsche]],  (1887) ''Morgenro:te: Gedanken u:ber die moralischen Vorurteile'' (1881). "Man ist nicht umsonst Philologe gewesen, man ist es vielleicht noch, das will sagen, ein Lehrer des langsamen Lesens: - endlich schreibt man auch langsam."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich (1887)''Daybreak: Thoughts on the Prejudices of Morality''. 2nd Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sven Birkerts|Birkerts]], in his book ''The Gutenberg Elegies'', stated "Reading, because we control it, is adaptable to our needs and rhythms. We are free to indulge our subjective associative impulse; the term I coin for this is deep reading: the slow and meditative possession of a book."&lt;ref name=Birkerts1994 /&gt;  Birkerts' emphasis  on the importance of personal control over the speed of reading is echoed by [[Philip Pullman|Pullman]], who additionally argued that taking control of the pace of one's reading is a form of personal freedom, and develops an appreciation of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Pullman, P. (2004). The War on Words. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,,1344082,00.html ''Guardian Review''], November 6, 2004. On-line&lt;/ref&gt;   A similar view was stated by [[Neil Postman|Postman]], who noted the character of the ordinary citizen of the 19th century, a mind that could listen for hours on end to political orations clearly shaped by a culture favouring text. Postman warns that reading books is important for developing rational thinking and political astuteness.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil (1985). ''Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business''. NY: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindsay Waters, Executive Editor for the Humanities at [[Harvard University Press]], declared a worldwide reading crisis resulting from our global push toward productivity. He asserts that young children are learning to read faster, skipping phonetics and diagramming sentences, and concludes that these children will not grow up to read [[John Milton|Milton]]. He foresees the end of graduate English literature programs. "There is something similar between a reading method that focuses primarily on the bottom-line meaning of a story in a novel and the economic emphasis on the bottom line that makes automobile manufacturers speed up assembly lines." He advised re-introducing time into reading: "The mighty imperative is to speed everything up, but there might be some advantage in slowing things down. People are trying slow eating. Why not slow reading?" &lt;ref&gt;Waters, Lindsay (2007), Time for Reading, [http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i23/23b00601.htm ''Chronicle of Higher Education''],  53(23).

==Slow movement==
[[Carl Honoré]], an advocate of the [[Slow movement (culture)|slow movement]], discusses slow reading in his book ''In Praise of Slow''.&lt;ref&gt;Honoré, Carl (2004). [url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gb0_TtNFwPYC ''In Praise of Slow: How a Worldwide Movement is Changing the Cult of Speed'']. Vintage Canada. pages 227-229&lt;/ref&gt;  He recommends slow reading as one of several practices to decelerate from the fast pace of modern life.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Lane (2005). Slow Is Beautiful: Living as If Life Really Mattered. ''Futurist'', ''39''(2) (Mar/Apr 2005): p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Laura Casey points out that the increasing availability of instant communication technologies, such as [[Text messaging|texting]] and social media like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], may be contributing to the decline of slow reading.&lt;ref&gt;Casey, Laura (January 5, 2011). Is deep reading in trouble?[http://www.insidebayarea.com/argus/ci_17008403 Contra Costa Times].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, novelist I. Alexander Olchowski founded the Slow Book Movement to advocate for reading practices related to the slow movement, including reading light material at a relaxed pace for pleasure, reading complex materials slowly for insight, reading materials of local interest and by local authors, and community building around local libraries and reading events.

== Research ==

While there is substantial research about involuntary slow reading, which can arise from a lack of fluency and is a predictor of [[dyslexia]],&lt;ref&gt;Wimmer, Heinz (1996). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00555368 "The Early Manifestation of Developmental [[Dyslexia]]: Evidence from German children"]. ''Reading and Writing'', 8(2).&lt;/ref&gt; there are a few studies which demonstrate the positive value of voluntary slow reading. Nell (1988) showed that there is substantial rate variability during natural reading, with most-liked pages being read significantly slower.&lt;ref&gt;Nell, V. (1988). The Psychology of Reading for Pleasure: Needs and Gratifications. ''Reading Research Quarterly'', Vol. 23, No. 1 (Winter, 1988), pp. 6-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Sherry Jr. and Schouten (2002) suggested that close reading could have commercial application as a research method for the use of poetry in marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Sherry, John F, Jr. and Schouten John W. (2002). A Role for Poetry in Consumer Research. ''Journal of Consumer Research'', 29(2), 218-234.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocates of speed-reading point out that [[subvocalization]] slows the speed of reading,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0-9934964-0-0|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cEFKjwEACAAJ&amp;dq=ultimate+study+method&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; but studies by Carver found no other observable negative effect on the reading process, and observed that the slower pace seemed to improve comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, Ronald, P. (1990). ''Reading Rate: A Review of Research and Theory''. San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2597">'''Soil crusts''' are [[soil]] surface layers that are distinct from the rest of the bulk soil, often hardened with a [[Ped#Platy|platy]] surface. Depending on the manner of formation, soil crusts can be biological or physical. Biological soil crusts are formed by communities of [[microorganisms]] that live on the soil surface whereas physical crusts are formed by physical impact such as that of raindrops.

==Biological soil crusts==
{{main|Biological soil crust}}
Biological soil crusts are communities of living organisms on the soil surface in arid- and semi-arid ecosystems. They are found throughout the world with varying species composition and cover depending on topography, soil characteristics, climate, plant community, microhabitats, and disturbance regimes. Biological soil crusts perform important ecological roles including carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation, soil stabilization, alter soil albedo and water relations, and affect germination and nutrient levels in vascular plants. They can be damaged by fire, recreational activity, grazing, and other disturbance and can require long time periods to recover composition and function. Biological soil crusts are also known as cryptogamic, microbiotic, microphytic, or cryptobiotic soils.

==Physical soil crusts==
Physical (as opposed to biological) soil crusts results from raindrop or trampling impacts. They are often hardened relative to uncrusted soil due to the accumulation of salts and silica. These can coexist with biological soil crusts, but have different ecological impact due to their difference in formation and composition. Physical soil crusts often reduce water infiltration, can inhibit plant establishment, and when disrupted can be eroded rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Belnap, Jayne, et al. 2001.

'''Tidal heating''' (also known as '''tidal working''' or '''tidal flexing''') occurs through the [[tidal friction]] processes: orbital energy is dissipated as heat in either the surface ocean or interior of a planet or satellite.  When an object is in an [[elliptic orbit|elliptical orbit]], the [[tidal force]]s acting on it are stronger near [[apsis|periapsis]] than
near apoapsis. Thus the deformation of the body due to tidal forces (i.e. the tidal bulge) varies over the course of its orbit, generating internal friction which heats its interior. This energy gained by the object comes from its [[gravitational energy]], so over time in a two-body system, the initial elliptical orbit decays into a circular orbit ([[tidal circularization]]). Sustained tidal heating occurs when the elliptical orbit is prevented from circularizing due to additional gravitational forces that keep tugging the object back into an elliptical orbit. In this more complex system, gravitational energy still is being converted to thermal energy; however, now the orbit's semi-major axis shrinks rather than its eccentricity.

Tidal heating is responsible for the most volcanically active body in the [[solar system]]: [[Io (moon)|Io]], a moon of [[Jupiter]]. Io's eccentricity persists as the result of its [[orbital resonance]]s with the other [[Galilean moons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Saturn's moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] is similarly thought to have a liquid water ocean beneath its icy crust due to tidal heating. The [[cryovolcano|water vapor geysers]] which eject material from Enceladus are thought to be powered by friction generated within this moon's shifting ice crust.&lt;ref&gt;Peale, S.J.

In the leading order over the inclination and eccentricity, the total amount of tidal heating in a satellite that is [[gravitational locking|spin-synchronous]] and has an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric orbit]] &lt;math&gt;\dot{E}_\text{Tidal}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{E}_\text{Tidal} = -\text{Im}(k_{2})\frac{21}{2}\frac{R^{5}n^{5}e^{2}}{G}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the satellite's mean radius, [[mean motion|mean orbital motion]], and eccentricity.&lt;ref&gt;Segatz, M., T.

[[Image:Tooth Interior Fatigue Fracture 1.jpg|thumb|right|Tooth interior fatigue fracture (TIFF) on intermediate gear]] 
[[Image:Tooth Interior Fatigue Fracture 2.jpg|thumb|right|The TIFF fracture surface has a distinct plateau in the central part along the tooth width and approximately mid-height of the tooth.]]
'''Tooth interior fatigue fracture''', (TIFF), is a type of [[gear]] failure.  The failure is characterised by a [[fracture]] at approximately mid-height on the tooth of the gear. This distinguishes it from a tooth root [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue failure]]. The crack for a TIFF is initiated in the interior of the tooth. This distinguishes TIFF from other fatigue failures of gears.  TIFF has been observed in [[Case hardening|case-hardened]] [[Idler-wheel|idlers]] (i.e. gear wheels loaded on both flanks during each revolution).

The TIFF fracture surface has a distinct plateau in the central part along the tooth width and approximately mid-height of the tooth. In a close-up of the cross-section of the TIFF small wing cracks are observed. The presence of the wing crack indicates that the main crack has propagated from the centre of the tooth toward the tooth flank.

The crack-producing [[Stress (physics)|stresses]] of TIFF are twofold: i) constant residual tensile stresses in the interior of the tooth due to case hardening; and ii) alternating stresses due to the idler usage of the gear wheel.

Contact [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] begins with surface distress, which can grow to [[spalling]]. In severe cases a secondary crack can grow from a spalling crater through the tooth thickness and a part of the tooth can fall off. In contrast to the fracture of severe contact fatigue, spalling craters are not necessary at the flank surface for a TIFF.
