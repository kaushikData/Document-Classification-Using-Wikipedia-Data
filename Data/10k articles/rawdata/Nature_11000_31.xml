      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3206">'''Ångström exponent''' is the name of the exponent in the formula that is usually used to describe the dependency of the [[aerosol]] [[optical thickness]], or aerosol [[refractive index#Dispersion and absorption|extinction coefficient]] on [[wavelength]].

Depending on particle size distribution, the spectral dependence of the aerosol optical thickness is given approximately by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\tau_\lambda}{\tau_{\lambda_0}}=\left (\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0}\right )^{-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the optical thickness at wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tau_{\lambda_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the optical thickness at the reference wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt;. In principle, if the optical thickness at one wavelength and the Ångström exponent are known, the optical thickness can be computed at a different wavelength. In practice, measurements are made of the optical thickness of an aerosol layer at two different wavelengths, and the Ångström exponent is estimated from these measurements using this formula. The aerosol optical thickness can then be derived at all other wavelengths, within the range of validity of this formula.

For measurements of optical thickness &lt;math&gt;\tau_{\lambda_1}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_{\lambda_2}\,&lt;/math&gt; taken at two different wavelengths &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2\,&lt;/math&gt; respectively, the Ångström exponent is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = - \frac{\log \frac{\tau_{\lambda_1}}{\tau_{\lambda_2}}}{\log \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The Ångström exponent is inversely related to the average size of the particles in the aerosol: the smaller the particles, the larger the exponent. Thus, Ångström exponent is a useful quantity to assess the particle size of atmospheric aerosols or clouds, and the wavelength dependence of the aerosol/cloud optical properties. For example, cloud droplet, usually with large sizes and thus very smaller Ångström exponent (nearly zero), is spectrally neutral, which means, e.g., the optical depth does not change with wavelength. This exponent is now routinely estimated by analyzing radiation measurements acquired on [[Earth observation|Earth Observation]] platforms, such as [[AErosol RObotic NETwork]], or [[AERONET]].

{{Holocene|image=[[File:Utro v sosnovom lesu.jpg|250px]]|caption=''Morning in a Pine Forest'', a painting by [[Ivan Shishkin]] and [[Konstantin Savitsky]].}}
In [[paleoclimatology]] of the [[Holocene]], the '''Boreal''' was the first of the [[Blytt-Sernander]] sequence of [[north Europe]]an climatic phases that were originally based on the study of Danish [[peat bog]]s, named for [[Axel Blytt]] and [[Rutger Sernander]], who first established the sequence. In peat bog [[sediment]]s, the Boreal is also recognized by its characteristic [[pollen zone]]. It was preceded by the [[Younger Dryas]], the last cold snap of the [[Pleistocene]], and followed by the [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic]], a warmer and moister period than our most recent [[climate]]. The Boreal, transitional between the two periods, varied a great deal, at times having within it climates like today's.

==Subdividing the Boreal==
Subsequent to the original Blytt-Sernander scheme, the first stage of the Boreal was divided off as a '''Pre-boreal''' transitional phase, followed by the Boreal proper. Some current schemes based on pollen zones also distinguish a pre-Boreal (pollen zone IV), an early Boreal (pollen zone V) and a late Boreal (pollen zone VIa, b, and c).

==Dating==
[[Image:Pine tree rings.JPG|thumb|left|Pine tree rings]]
One commonly cited date for the end of the [[Younger Dryas]] and the start of the Pre-Boreal is 11,500 [[Before Present]] calibrated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} The start of the period is relatively sharply defined by a rise of 7&amp;nbsp;°C in 50 years in South Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dansgaard|first=W.|last2=White|first2=J. W. C.|last3=Johnsen|first3=S. J.|date=1989-06-15|title=The abrupt termination of the Younger Dryas climate event|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v339/n6225/pdf/339532a0.pdf|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=339|issue=6225|pages=532–534|doi=10.1038/339532a0|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date is based fairly solidly on [[Greenland]] [[ice core]]s, which give 11,640 [[Before Present|BP]] for the late Younger Dryas and 11,400 BP for the early Pre-Boreal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[Image:Varve1.gif|thumb|right|Varves]]
But estimates of other dates vary by up to 1000 years, for a number of reasons. First, "Boreal" can identify a paleoclimate, a pollen zone or a temporally-fixed chronozone, and those three bases of definition allow quite different dates. Second, different [[dating method]]s obtain different dates. The underlying problem is that climate and pollen vary somewhat from region to region. The scientists of each region use the methods available in their region, whether lake [[varves]], the annual layers of sediment from ancient or modern lake bottoms, ice cores or counts of tree rings ([[dendrochronology]]).

Standardization has become of increasing concern to scientists everywhere. Dates from many methods continue to multiply as paleoclimatologists seek higher resolution. But it is unclear whether regional variation will allow high-resolution standardization.

[[Image:Dds40-097 large.jpeg|thumb|right|Distribution of [[tephra]]]]
Yet, there are some solid dates of the Pre-Boreal and Boreal. The [[Saksunarvatn tephra]] (an ash layer of volcanic fall-out) is dated in Greenland ice to 10,180±60 BP; in lake deposits at Krakenes in Norway, to 10,010–9,980 years BP calibrated; in northwest German lakes, to 10,090 BP calibrated. The tephra occurs in early Boreal contexts. So, it seems certain that the early Boreal (pollen zone V) includes the year 10,000 BP. Similarly, the late Boreal includes the Kilian/Vasset tephra of Swiss and southwest German lakes at 8200 BP, all calibrated. But the borders are less certain.

[[Image:Peat artisanal exploitation2.jpg|thumb|left|Peat]]
Studies of [[bog]]s in northwest [[Russia]] are the basis for a division of the PreBoreal (PB) into PB-1, 10,000-9800, and PB-2, 9800–9300 BP incal. The scheme goes on to divide the Boreal (BO) into BO-1, 9300–9000, BO-2, 9000–8500, and BO-3, 8500–8000, incal. [http://www.calpal-online.de/index.html CalPal] used on these dates suggests overall boundaries of 11,500 and 10,500 BP for the Pre-Boreal, and the end of the Boreal at 8900.

Dates given recently are usually earlier than those given more than 10 years ago. For example, Iverson (1973) and Rud (1979) give dates of 10,000–9000 BP for the PreBoreal and 9000–8000 BP for the Boreal, which are uncalibrated C-14 dates based on Scandinavian pollen stratigraphy.

Presumably, more-recent dates are more accurate, as technology improves with time, often quite rapidly. Yet, pollen and climate phases also to some degree may depend on latitude, so no date can be regarded as certainly wrong. Scientists look for the overall pattern of the dates, but that technique is not 100% reliable, either.

== Description ==
[[Image:Tundra coastal vegetation Alaska.jpg|thumb|left|Tundra]]

Before the Pre-Boreal, [[Eurasia]] was locked in the chill of the Younger Dryas and was a mostly continuous [[tundra]] belt, with regions of [[taiga]], covered with a blanket of grasses, shrubs and other low plants typical of open land. Large numbers of [[herbivore]]s wandered in herds over vast distances. The blanket teemed with small, rapidly reproducing species, which supported food chains of larger predators. The largest predators and humans hunted the mammals of the open tundra.

The Pre-Boreal began with a sudden rise in temperature that abruptly changed this ecosystem. Forest replaced the open lands in Europe, and forest-dwelling animals spread from southern [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] and replaced the ice-age tundra mammals; new climax ecosystems developed. The old fauna persisted in [[Central Asia]], but were soon hunted out, as they were not replenished by the larger areas formerly nourishing the ecosystem.

The sea brought additional isolation by rising rapidly and drowning the entire coast. [[Ireland]] was cut off early in the Boreal, suffering an impoverishment of species. It is home to only two-thirds of the species present in Britain. Britain was cut off by the end of the Boreal. Forest had closed over the former European tundra.

Humans had to adapt to the encroaching forest or move east with the large mammals. Those who stayed became hunter-gatherers of the forests and fishers of the numerous bays, inlets and shallow waters around the thousands of islands that now spangled the seas of Europe. They lived richly and were encouraged to enter the pre-productive phase that we call the [[Mesolithic]]. Those who moved east hunted out the last of wild big game and turned their best efforts into learning to herd what was left. In the Americas, humans had left the [[Paleoindian]] phase and were now in the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]].

Meanwhile humanity toward the south of the north temperate zone had already turned to food production in a number of widely separated locations and were on the brink of civilization. There is no evidence of any extensive contact with the cultures of the north during the Boreal. The producers tended to live in dense centers without any interest in moving from there except when motivated to find new lands. The gatherers ranged widely over their lands, building only temporary settlements in which to spend the winter.

==Flora==
[[Image:Ruovesi Forest.jpg|thumb|right|Birch forest near Ruovesi, Finland]]
During the Pre-Boreal pollen zone IV, large quantities of tree pollen began to replace the pollen of open-land species, as the most mobile and flexible arboreal species colonized their way northward, replacing the ice-age tundra plants. Foremost among them were the [[birch]]es, ''[[Betula pubescens]]'' and ''[[Betula pendula]]'', accompanied by ''[[Sorbus aucuparia]]'' and quaking aspen, ''[[Aspen|Populus tremula]]''. Especially sensitive to temperature changes and moving northward almost immediately were ''Juniperus nana'' and ''J. communis'', the dwarf and shrub [[juniper]] respectively, which reached a maximum density in the Pre-Boreal, before their niches were shaded out. [[Pine]] soon followed, for which reason the resulting open woodland is often called a birch or a pine-birch forest. 
[[Image:Swedish Spruce Forest.jpg|thumb|right|Swedish spruce forest]]

In the yet warmer early Boreal pollen zone V, ''Corylus avellana'' ([[hazel]])  and pine expanded into the birch woodlands to such a degree that [[palynology|palynologists]] refer to the resulting ecology as the hazel-pine forest. In the late Boreal it was supplanted by the spread of a deciduous forest called the mixed-oak forest. Pine, birch and hazel were reduced in favor of ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Ulmus]]'', ''[[Tilia]]'' and ''[[Alnus]]''. The former tundra was now closed by a canopy of dense forest. In the marshland ''[[Typha latifolia]]'' prevailed. Less cold-tolerant species such as [[ivy]] and [[mistletoe]] were to be found in [[Denmark]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Fauna==
[[Image:Ours des pyrenees aspe 2002.jpg|thumb|left|Brown bear of the Pyrenees]]
The new forest was populated with animals from [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] in Italy, Spain and the Balkans.  Animals such as ''[[Emys orbicularis]]'' (European pond tortoise), which require warmer temperatures, were to be found in [[Denmark]]. The [[Eurasian golden plover]] came as far north as [[Norway]].

[[Image:Auerochse-02.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstituted aurochs]]
Forest [[ungulates]] included: [[Cervidae]] ''Cervus elaphus'' ([[red deer]]), ''Capreolus capreolus'' ([[roe deer]]), ''Alces alces'' ([[moose|elk]]), ''[[Boar|Sus scrofa]]'' (wild pig), and ''Bos primigenius'' ([[aurochs]]). Predators included: ''Canis lupus'' ([[wolf]]), ''Ursus arctos'' ([[brown bear]]), ''Lynx lynx'' ([[lynx]]), ''Felis sylvestris'' ([[wildcat]]), and herbivores ''Lepus europaeus'' ([[European hare]]).

[[Image:Franz Marc 018.jpg|thumb|right|''Deer in the Reeds'', by Franz Marc]]
The inland waters would have contained mammal species such as ''Castor fiber'' ([[beaver]]), ''Lutra lutra'' ([[otter]]) and species of fish such as ''Esox lucius'' ([[northern pike]]) and ''Siluris glanis'' ([[catfish]]).

== Humans ==
The Preboreal-Boreal in Europe was a time of transition from the [[Palaeolithic]] cultures to the [[Mesolithic]]. Forests and drowned coastlands were places of plenty. Human settlements avoided the deep forest in favor of [[stream]]s, [[lake]]s, and especially [[bay]]s of the [[ocean]].

Pre-Boreal settlements have been found in north-central Europe, such as at [[Friesack]]. There an unusual find of net fragments made from plant fibers suggested that fishing was an important part of life.

Finds from another settlement at [[Vis, Russia|Vis]], near the [[Vychegda River]] in [[Russia]], offer more details of life in a settlement of the Boreal. Plant fibers were used for [[basket]]s and for hafting bone points to shafts. Fishermen crossed the waters in bark boats plied by [[oar]]s, and set nets. They also made hand-held nets from wooden hoops and plant fiber.

Food gathering continued in winter: [[ski]]s and sledge runners have been found. [[Reindeer]] continued to be hunted and probably herded. Bows, arrows, and spears have been found. Implements were likely to be embellished by sculpting in wood or bone. Only a few motifs were used: the elk's head, the snake, and human.

In Europe, the major culture was the [[Maglemosian]] (9000–6400 BC), extending into [[Denmark]] and Russia. Localized cultures included the [[Nieman culture|Nieman]] of [[Lithuania]], the [[History of Estonia|Kunda]] of [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]], the [[Azilian]] of [[France]], and the Epi-Gravettian of [[Italy]]. Towards the end of the Mesolithic, local traditions began to multiply, perhaps due to influences from the south, or due to the general advance of culture.

In [[North America]] the [[San Dieguito Complex]] and Lake Mojave Complex existed in this period, located in Southern [[California]]'s coastal region and [[Mojave Desert]], and in northern Mexico's [[Sonoran Desert]] in the [[Yuma Desert]] and [[Baja California peninsula]].

The '''Boston Christmas Tree''' is the [[Boston|City of Boston, Massachusetts']] official [[Christmas tree]].  A tree has been lit each year since 1941,&lt;ref name=events/&gt; and since 1971 it has been given to the people of Boston by the people of [[Nova Scotia]] in thanks for their assistance after the 1917 [[Halifax Explosion]].  The tree is lit in the [[Boston Common (park)|Boston Common]] throughout the Christmas season.

==Halifax explosion==
{{main article|Halifax Explosion}}

On December 6, 1917 at 9:04:35 am,&lt;ref name=halifax/&gt; the [[Halifax Explosion]] severely destroyed much of the city, by the largest man-made explosion up to that time. Boston authorities learned of the disaster by telegraph, and quickly organized and dispatched a relief train around 10&amp;nbsp;pm to assist survivors. A blizzard delayed the train, which finally arrived in the early morning of December 8, and immediately began distributing food, water, and medical supplies. Numerous personnel on the train were able to relieve the Nova Scotia medical staff, most of whom had worked without rest since the explosion occurred.  Nova Scotian children study the explosion in school and they know "Boston was one of the first responders, and really a lifesaver."&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thanks"/&gt;

[[Nova Scotia]] donated a large [[Christmas tree]] to the city of [[Boston]] in thanks and remembrance for the help  Boston [[Red Cross]] and the Massachusetts Public Safety Committee provided immediately after the Halifax Explosion of 1917.&lt;ref name=virginia/&gt;  Another tree was sent in 1971, and every year since.&lt;ref name="virginia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twice"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hefty/&gt;  

The annual gift was started by the [[Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg County]] Christmas Tree Producers Association to promote Christmas tree exports as well as acknowledge the Boston support after the explosion. The gift was  taken over by the Nova Scotia Government in 1976 to continue the goodwill gesture and to promote trade and tourism.&lt;ref name="expert"/&gt;  

In 2017, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the explosion, Boston Mayor [[Martin J. Walsh]], Halifax Mayor [[Michael Savage (politician)|Michael Savage]], and Nova Scotia Premier [[Stephen McNeil]] unveiled a plaque on the Boston Common near the site of the tree.&lt;ref name=honor/&gt;  The tree that year was donated in honor of [[first responders]] in the two cities.&lt;ref name=honor/&gt;

Joseph Slauenwhite donated the first two trees.&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt;  The tree typically comes from the southern half of the province, but in 2014 the tree came from [[Antigonish County]], in the north&lt;ref name="Antigonish"/&gt; and in 2016 the first tree ever from [[Cape Breton Island]] was selected.&lt;ref name=crown/&gt;  In 2018, the first tree from [[Cumberland County, Nova Scotia|Cumberland County]] was donated.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;

The province also donates smaller trees to [[Rosie's Place]] and the [[Pine Street Inn]], homeless shelters in Boston.&lt;ref name="arrival"/&gt;

==Tree selection==
The Christmas Tree Extension Specialist whose responsibility it is to select a tree is "always looking" for trees, and keeps a list of trees for years.&lt;ref name=thanks/&gt;&lt;ref name=twice/&gt;&lt;ref name=yard/&gt;  The scouting for the current year's tree begins in June and July.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;

Most donors are "honored to give up their trees... [and] most will gladly watch their towering trees fall" since everyone knows the reason it is being sent to Boston.&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;  Owners often would not normally "have dreamed of cutting down the big spruce Grandpa planted" but will "gladly part with it" when told it is going to Boston.&lt;ref name=twice/&gt;  They "consider it a great honor" and  say, 'Oh, my God, how can I refuse?"'&lt;ref name=twice/&gt;  It is sometimes donated in memory of a family member who died in the explosion.&lt;ref name=virginia/&gt;  The process can be political as families vie to have their tree chosen.&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;

===Specifications===
Knowing its symbolic importance to both cities, the [[Government of Nova Scotia#Ministries|Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources]] has specific guidelines for selecting the tree. It must be an attractive [[balsam fir]], [[white spruce]] or [[red spruce]], 12 to 16 meters (40 to 50 feet) tall, healthy with good color, medium to heavy density, uniform and symmetrical and easy to access.&lt;ref name=Dedham/&gt;  The trees do not usually come from [[tree farms]], but from open land where they can grow tall and full.&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;&lt;ref name=twice/&gt;

===Christmas Tree Specialist===
The Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources Christmas Tree Specialist has the responsibility for selecting the tree each year.  For the specialist the "tree can be elusive, the demands excessive, and the job requires remembering the locations of the best specimens in the province and persuading the people who own them to give them up for a pittance."&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;  The first Specialist was Tom Ernst, and he was followed in the 1990s by Peter Romkey.&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;  {{As of|2017}},  the Christmas Tree Extension Specialist responsible for selecting the Boston tree is Ross H. Pentz,&lt;ref name=yard/&gt; a position he has held since 2001.&lt;ref name=benefits/&gt;

==Tree cutting and ceremony==
Before the tree is cut, each branch is individually tied to the trunk.&lt;ref  name=benefits/&gt;  It takes two men a day and a half to prepare the tree to be cut down.&lt;ref name=benefits/&gt;  A crane holds the tree at the top while it is cut at the base by a chainsaw.&lt;ref  name=benefits/&gt;

The tree cutting ceremony has been described as "quite the local spectacle for Nova Scotians,"&lt;ref name=parade/&gt; and features representatives from the province, the United States Consulate in Halifax, the Christmas Tree Council of Nova Scotia, hundreds of local school children, a [[town crier]], [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], Nova Scotia conservation officers, an Antigonish bagpiper, the Nova Scotia Mass Choir, and [[Santa Claus]].&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;&lt;ref name=Antigonish/&gt;{{refn|group = nb|The Tree's official twitter feed has a video of the tree being cut in 2017.&lt;ref name=video/&gt;}}

In 2014, students and staff in the environmental technologies program at the [[Nova Scotia Community College]] Strait Area Campus cut down that year's tree.&lt;ref name=Antigonish/&gt;

==Transporting the tree==
[[File:School children welcome the Boston Christmas Tree.jpg|thumb|School children from the [[Mather Elementary School]] wave to the tree from Tremont Street on the Boston Common]]
The tree travels over {{convert|750|mile|km|-2}} to Boston, with a stop at the [[Grand Parade (Halifax)|Grand Parade in Halifax]] for a public send-off ceremony featuring a live musical performance by [[The Stanfields]].&lt;ref name=Antigonish/&gt;    Attendees are also invited to sign a thank you book for Boston.&lt;ref name="Antigonish"/&gt;  The tree travels by truck across Nova Scotia, then cruises on a ferry across the [[Bay of Fundy]], continuing by truck through Maine and New Hampshire to Boston.&lt;ref name="love"/&gt;  People stand on the sides of roads and on highway overpasses to get a glimpse of the tree and to take pictures.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; 

In 2013, the tree was led out of Halifax  by a group of runners in honor of victims of the [[Boston Marathon bombings]].&lt;ref name="love"/&gt;  Special permits are required to transport the tree through Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Maine.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;

==Tree arrival and lighting==
[[File:A Town Crier and Santa Claus welcome the Boston Christmas Tree.jpg|thumb|A Town Crier and Santa Claus welcome the Boston Christmas Tree on the Boston Common.]]
The tree arrives in Boston under police escort.&lt;ref name=arrival/&gt;  In the same way that schoolchildren see the tree off in Nova Scotia, schoolchildren from Boston are on hand to welcome it to the [[Boston Common]].&lt;ref name="arrival"/&gt;

The tree lighting takes place on the Common in late November or early December.  The event attracts about 20,000 people&lt;ref name=Antigonish/&gt; and 200,000 watch the broadcast on [[WCVB]].&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;  The 1998 tree required more than 3,200 man hours to decorate, as well as {{convert|4+1/2|mile|km|0}} of wire and 17,000 multi-colored lights.&lt;ref name=pru/&gt; The 2006 tree was covered in 8,000 bulbs.&lt;ref name="zinck"/&gt;

The tree donated by Nova Scotia was placed at the [[Prudential Tower|Prudential Center]] from 1971&lt;ref name="pru"/&gt; until 2002, when it was moved to the Boston Common because of planned development.&lt;ref name="tis"/&gt;

==Significance to Nova Scotia==
The tree is so important to the people of Nova Scotia that "people have cried over it, argued about it, even penned song lyrics in its honour."&lt;ref name="globe"/&gt;  Lands and Forestry Minister [[Iain Rankin (politician)|Iain Rankin]] called it "one of our proudest traditions."&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;  A spokesman for the spokesman for the Department of Lands and Forestry said "It never ceases to amaze me how excited people get about it every year.  The whole province gets excited about the tree. It’s a big deal."

==Expense==
While the donation of the Christmas Tree is first and foremost a gift, it is also a major marketing effort for Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;&lt;ref name=hefty/&gt;  In 2015, the total cost of the tree, transportation, ceremonies, and parties was {{CA$|242,000}}&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;&lt;ref name=hefty/&gt;({{US$|179000}}&lt;ref name=learn/&gt;).

The scouting of the tree costs {{CA$|1,900}}, and the cutting ceremony was {{CA$|2500}}.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;  For all of their coverage and efforts, CTV Atlantic received {{CA$|25000}}.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;  Promotion on Facebook and Instagram cost an additional {{CA$|900}}.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;  The sendoff in Halifax cost {{CA$|10000}} and transporting the tree cost {{CA$|4000}}.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;   Merchandise was given away at events in both Massachusetts and Nova Scotia, including [[tuques]] at a cost of {{CA$|11,000}}, [[Flag of Nova Scotia|flags]] at {{CA$|1000}} and [[lanyards]] at {{CA$|3000}}.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;

Provincial officials, including the premier and his staff, were flown to Boston and put up in local hotels at an expense of {{CA$|12,000}}.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;&lt;ref name=learn/&gt;  The MacEachern family also received {{CA$|1000}} in travel expenses.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;  WCVB, the Boston ABC affiliate received {{US$|55000}} ({{CA$|75000}}) to broadcast a live one-hour tree lighting special.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;&lt;ref name=hefty/&gt;&lt;ref name=learn/&gt;  A television commercial promoting Nova Scotia would cost about four times as much.&lt;ref name=hefty/&gt;  The ceremony itself cost {{US$|30000}} ({{CA$|41000}}), which was paid by Nova Scotia to the City of Boston.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;&lt;ref name=hefty/&gt;  This is less than half of the {{US$|85000}} the ceremony costs.&lt;ref name=learn/&gt;

A reception at the Omni Parker House cost {{CA$|9000}}.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;&lt;ref name=learn/&gt;  It was attended by the official delegation, as well as Nova Scotian businessmen who traveled at their own expense, and Nova Scotians living in the Boston area.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;

Given the media coverage the province gets in return, and “When you look at the entire scope of the thing, it’s a pretty good value for the province of Nova Scotia,” according to Ed McHugh, who teaches business and marketing at [[Nova Scotia Community College]].&lt;ref name=learn/&gt;

==Media coverage==

The "regional media coverage [of the tree cutting ceremony is] huge."&lt;ref name=thanks/&gt;  Television personalities from [[CTV Atlantic]] host the tree cutting ceremony and the send off in Halifax.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;  In addition, their contract commits them to doing weather items and "tree related elements" live from Boston during the evening news on both the day of the lighting and the day after.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;  In 2015, CTV produced and aired a 30-second commercial over a period of 10 days.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;  They also provided digital promotion and news promotions.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;  CTV estimates that this contribution represents a {{CA$|30,000}} benefit to the province.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;

The tree is also promoted on Facebook and Instagram.&lt;ref name=cost/&gt;

The '''Brussels effect''' is the process of unilateral regulatory globalisation caused by the [[European Union]] [[de facto]] (but not necessarily [[de_jure|de jure]]) externalising its laws outside its borders through market mechanisms.

== Cause ==
The combination of market size, market importance&lt;ref name=Bradford2012&gt;Bradford, Anu (2012) ''The Brussels Effect.'' Northwestern University Law Review, Vol. 107, No. 1, 2012; Columbia Law and Economics Working Paper No. 533. SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2770634 &lt;/ref&gt;, relatively stringent standards and regulatory capacity&lt;ref&gt;Bach, David and Newman, Abraham (2007) – ''The European regulatory state and global public policy: micro-institutions, macro-influence'' – Journal of European Public Policy https://doi.org/10.1080/13501760701497659&lt;/ref&gt; of the European Union can have the effect that firms trading internationally find that it is not economically, legally or technically practical to maintain lower standards in non-EU markets. Non-EU companies exporting globally can find that it is beneficial to adopt standards set in Brussels uniformly throughout their business.&lt;ref&gt;''The Brussels Effect: The Rise of a Regulatory Superstate in Europe.'' Columbia Law School http://www.law.columbia.edu/media_inquiries/news_events/2013/january2013/brussels-effect&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal – ''Hot U.S. Import: European Regulations'' May 2018 https://www.wsj.com/articles/techs-pickup-of-new-data-privacy-rules-reflects-eus-growing-influence-1525685400&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The term Brussels effect was coined in 2012 by Professor Anu Bradford of Columbia Law School&lt;ref name=Bradford2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lecture, March 2012 - "''The Brussels Effect: The Rise of a Regulatory Superstate in Europe''" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeFmR3Fkjzw&lt;/ref&gt; and named after the similar [[California effect]] that can be seen within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vogel|first1=David|title=Trading Up: Consumer and Environmental regulation in a global economy|date=1995|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674900837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Race to the top and race to the bottom ==
The [[California effect]] and the Brussels effect are a form of ‘race to the top’ where the most stringent standard has an appeal to companies operating across multiple regulatory environments as it makes global production and exports easier.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times – ''Why the ‘Brussels effect’ will undermine Brexit regulatory push'' July 2017 https://www.ft.com/content/fd5ca278-6654-11e7-8526-7b38dcaef614&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times – ''Why the whole world feels the ‘Brussels effect’'' November 2017 https://www.ft.com/content/7059dbf8-a82a-11e7-ab66-21cc87a2edde&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yale Insights – ''Three Questions: Prof. David Bach on the Reach of European Privacy Regulations'' https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/three-questions-prof-david-bach-on-the-reach-of-european-privacy-regulations&lt;/ref&gt; The effects are the opposite of the ''Delaware effect'', a [[race to the bottom]] where jurisdictions can purposely choose to lower its regulatory requirements in an attempt to attract businesses looking for the least stringent standard. &lt;ref name="Bloomberg NJ Del."&gt;{{cite news|author1=Robert E. Wright|title=How Delaware Became the King of U.S. Corporate Charters|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2012-06-08/how-delaware-became-the-king-of-u-s-corporate-charters|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=''Bloomberg View''|date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
===Anti-trust===
The October 2000 $42 billion proposed acquisition of US-based Honeywell International by US-based General Electric was blocked by the EU antitrust authorities on the grounds of risking a horizontal monopoly in jet engines. The merger could not proceed because, despite the American Department of Justice having already approved the merger between these two US based entities, it was not legally possible to let the acquisition proceed in one important market, but not in another. &lt;ref name=Bradford2012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Commission – Case No COMP/M.2220 - General Electric/Honeywell http://ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/isef/case_details.cfm?proc_code=2_M_2220&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemicals===
US-based multinational [[Dow Chemical]] announced in 2006 it would comply with the EU's [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH) regulation for the production and use of chemical substances across its global operation.&lt;ref name=Bradford2012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dow and REACH - Protecting human health and the environment https://reach.dow.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reach External FAQs https://consumer.dow.com/en-us/technical-support/ehs-portal/reach-external-faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airplane emissions===
In 2012 the EU included aviation into its existing [[European_Union_Emission_Trading_Scheme|Emission Trading Scheme]]. This means that any airline, regardless of their country of origin, has to purchase emissions permits for any flights within the [[European_Economic_Area|European Economic Area]]. &lt;ref&gt;European Commission – Reducing emissions from aviation https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/aviation_en&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of complying with EU aviation emission regulation puts pressure on manufacturers to design airplanes with improved efficiency and reduced emissions. As major airlines would not likely purchase airplanes specifically to fly outside the EEA, the EU’s stricter aviation standards have an impact on global airplane fleets, regardless of the jurisdiction of the airline.&lt;ref name=Bradford2012 /&gt;

===Data protection and privacy===
With the introduction of the[[Data_Protection_Directive | Data Protection Directive]] in 1995 the EU had opted for a strict top-down approach to data privacy. &lt;ref&gt;Gady, Franz-Stefan (2014) EU/U.S. Approaches to Data Privacy and the "Brussels Effect": A Comparative Analysis https://www.jstor.org/stable/43773645&lt;/ref&gt; Its successor, the EU's [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR), was adopted on 14 April 2016 and had a global effect &lt;ref&gt;Financial Times – ''Information wars: How Europe became the world’s data police'' May 2018 https://www.ft.com/content/1aa9b0fa-5786-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development – ''Europe’s Data Privacy Rules Set New Global Approach to Consumer Rights'' May 2018 https://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges/news/europe%e2%80%99s-data-privacy-rules-set-new-global-approach-to-consumer-rights&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2017, during negotiations for a new Japan-EU trade deal, Japan set up an independent agency to handle privacy complaints to conform with the EU's new privacy regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Politico.EU – ''Europe’s new data protection rules export privacy standards worldwide'' January 2018 https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-data-protection-privacy-standards-gdpr-general-protection-data-regulation/&lt;/ref&gt;
Facebook announced in April 2018 that it would implement parts of the GDPR globally&lt;ref&gt;Facebook's commitment to data protection and privacy in compliance with the GDPR https://www.facebook.com/business/news/facebooks-commitment-to-data-protection-and-privacy-in-compliance-with-the-gdpr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Complying With New Privacy Laws and Offering New Privacy Protections to Everyone, No Matter Where You Live https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/new-privacy-protections/&lt;/ref&gt;, Sonos announced in April 2018 that it would implement the GDPR globally&lt;ref&gt;We’re Updating the Sonos Privacy Statement https://blog.sonos.com/en-gb/updating-sonos-privacy-statement/&lt;/ref&gt; and Microsoft announced in May 2018 that it would implement GDPR compliance for all its customers globally.&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft’s commitment to GDPR, privacy and putting customers in control of their own data https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/05/21/microsofts-commitment-to-gdpr-privacy-and-putting-customers-in-control-of-their-own-data/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite''' (CRRES) was launched on July 25, 1990 into a [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]] (GTO) for a nominal three-year mission to investigate fields, [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]], and energetic particles inside the Earth's [[magnetosphere]]. As part of the CRRES program, the SPACERAD (Space Radiation Effects) project, managed by Air Force Geophysics Laboratory, investigated the radiation environment of the inner and outer radiation belts and measured radiation effects on state-of-the-art microelectronics devices.

Other magnetospheric, [[Ionosphere|ionospheric]], and [[cosmic ray]] experiments were also included onboard CRRES and supported by [[NASA]] or the Office of Naval Research. The chemical release project was managed by [[NASA]]/[[Marshall Space Flight Center|MSFC]] and utilized the release of chemicals from onboard canisters at low altitudes near dawn and dusk perigee times and at high altitudes near local midnight. The chemical releases were monitored with optical and radar instrumentation by ground-based observers to measure the bulk properties and movement of the expanding clouds of photo-ionized plasma along field lines after the releases occurred. In order to study the magnetosphere at different local times during the mission, the satellite orbit was designed to precess with respect to the Earth-Sun line such that the local time at apogee decreased by 2.5 minutes/day from 08:00 (LT) just after launch and returned to this position in nineteen month cycles.

The CRRES spacecraft had the shape of an octagonal [[Prism (geometry)|prism]] with solar arrays on the top side. The prism is 1 m high and 3 m between opposite faces. Four of the eight compartments were for the chemical canisters and the other four housed the SPACERAD and other experiments. The spacecraft body was spun at 2.2 rpm about a spin axis in the ecliptic plane and kept pointed about 12 degrees ahead of the Sun's apparent motion in celestial coordinates. Pre-launch and in-flight operations were supported by the Space Test and Transportation Program Office of the U.S. Air Force Space Division. Contact with the CRRES spacecraft was lost on October 12, 1991 and was presumed to be due to onboard battery failure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3581">A '''cataract bog''' is a rare ecological community formed where a permanent stream flows over a [[granite]] [[outcropping]]. The sheeting of water keeps the edges of the rock wet without eroding the soil; in this precarious location no tree or large shrub can maintain a roothold. The result is a narrow, permanently wet, sunny habitat.

While a cataract bog is host to plants typical of a bog, it is technically a [[fen]]. [[Bog]]s get water from the atmosphere, while fens get their water from groundwater seepage.&lt;ref name=McMillan&gt;{{cite web |last=McMillan |first=Patrick |title=Mountain Bogs on the Verge of Vanishing |url=http://www.myoutdoortv.com/wildlife/expeditions-with-patrick-mcmillan |work=Expeditions with Patrick McMillan |accessdate=20 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729051109/http://www.myoutdoortv.com/wildlife/expeditions-with-patrick-mcmillan |archivedate=29 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cataract bogs inhabit a narrow, linear zone next to the stream and are partly shaded by trees and shrubs in the adjacent plant communities.&lt;ref name=Porcher&gt;{{cite book|last=Porcher|first=Richard Dwight|title=A Guide to the Wildflowers of South Carolina|year=2001|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, South Carolina|isbn=1-57003-438-9|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae growing on the rocks can make the surface slippery and dangerous for those exploring a cataract bog.&lt;ref name=Spira&gt;{{cite book|last=Spira|first=Timothy P.|title=Wildflowers &amp; Plant Communities of the Southern Appalachian Mountains &amp; Piedmont|year=2011|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-8078-7172-0|pages=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typical species ==
The rushing water carves out small depressions where soil accumulates, forming micro-islands that play host to plants that thrive with low levels of nutrients and shallow root structures. Typical species include [[Sphagnum moss]]; carnivorous plants such as round-leaf sundew (''[[Drosera rotundifolia]]''), pitcher plants (''[[Sarracenia purpurea]]'' and ''[[Sarracenia jonesii|S. jonesii]]''), and horned bladderwort (''[[Utricularia cornuta]]''); several orchid species such as common grass pink (''[[Calopogon tuberosus]]''), small green wood-orchid (''[[Platanthera clavellata]]''), rose pogonia (''[[Pogonia ophioglossoides]]''), and nodding ladies'-tresses (''[[Spiranthes cernua]]''). Other plants found in cataract bogs are limeseep grass-of-Parnassus (''[[Parnassia]] grandifolia''), Indian paint brush (''[[Castilleja coccinea]]''), stiff cowbane (''[[Oxypolis rigidior]]''), Appalachian bluet (''[[Houstonia serpyllifolia]]'') and northern sundrops (''[[Oenothera tetragona]]'').&lt;ref name="Porcher" /&gt;

The plant communities are fragile because of their tenuous attachment to thin soil above the rock substrate. During prolonged drought, the stream may dry up and the edges of the micro-islands curl up. Heavy rainfall can then wash away the micro-islands, so a cataract bog is in a continual state of change and renewal.&lt;ref name="Spira" /&gt;

== Location ==
Cataract bogs are found only in the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] of the [[United States]], at elevations of between {{convert|1200|and|2400|ft}}. They are restricted to the [[Blue Ridge Escarpment]] region of [[South Carolina]] and a small area of [[North Carolina]], a region with exceptionally high rainfall.&lt;ref name="McMillan" /&gt;

      <comment>Dearest hulk, the letter was included in a package of all paperwork on the cited NDRC project.  It is on NDRC letterhead, and it is from the well documented Chief of Section 7, responsible for fire control development.  Would posting a full image be considered "original" research?  Considering the quality of much editing I find lately I am at a loss as to what your problem is, aside from overuse of weaselwords such as "wonky."  Please feel free to escalate this "difference of opinion."</comment>

The '''Computron''' was an electron tube designed to perform the parallel addition and multiplication of digital numbers.  It was conceived by Richard L. Snyder, Jr., [[Jan A. Rajchman]], Paul Rudnick and the digital computer group at the laboratories of the [[Radio Corporation of America]] under the direction of [[Vladimir Zworykin]].  Development began in 1941 under contract OEM-sr-591 to Division 7 of the [[National Defense Research Committee]] of the United States Office of Research and Development.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Mindell ''Between human and machine: feedback, control, and computing before cybernetics'',JHU Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0-8018-6895-5}}, page 292&lt;/ref&gt;

The numerical function of the Computron was to solve the equation   &lt;math&gt;S=(A*B)+C+D&lt;/math&gt;   where A, B, C, and D are 14 bit inputs and S is a 28 bit output. This function was key to the RCA attempt to produce a non-[[analog computer]] based [[fire-control system]] for use in artillery aiming during WWII.

A simple way to describe the physically complex Computron is to begin with a [[cathode ray tube]] structure in the form of a right-circular cylinder with a central vertical cathode structure.  The cylinder is composed of 14 discrete planes, each plane having 14 individual radial outward projecting beams.  Each of the 196 individual beams is steered by multiple deflection plates toward its two targets.  Some deflection plates are connected to circuitry external to the Computron and are the data inputs.  The balance of the plates are connected to internal targets and are the partial sums and products from other stages within the tube.  Some of the targets are connected to circuitry outside the tube and represent the result.

The electronic function of the Computron design incorporated steered, rather than gated, multiple electron beams.    Additionally, the Computron was based on the ability of a [[secondary electron emission]] target, under electron bombardment, to assume the potential of the nearest collector electrode.  The [[Additron Tube]] design by [[Josef Kates]] gated electron beams of a fixed trajectory with several control grids which either passed or blocked a current.  The Computron was a complex cathode ray tube while the Additron was a [[triode]] with multiple grids and targets.

A subsection of the Computron was prototyped and tested and the concept validated but the building of an entire device was never attempted.

A United States Patent was filed 30 July 1943 and granted 22 July 1947 for the Computron.

== Modern implications ==

The Computron design was an early attempt to produce not only a vacuum tube [[integrated circuit]] for both size and reliability (lifetime) issues, but to minimize external electrical connections between active elements.  The goal of integration is not merely to reduce external signal connections into and out of a package by including multiple active devices in one package, as in the [[Loewe 3NF]] tube. It is to merge the functions of the active devices for a technical synergy.  A modern example would be the multiple-emitter transistor of [[transistor–transistor logic]] integrated circuits

Another modern construct anticipated by the Computron is the [[barrel shifter]] circuit which is used in many numeric computation  style microprocessors.

== Damning praise ==

The Computron was an idea born of the necessity of war research.  It was to be a key element of the electronic digital computer which had yet to be built.  But the project was begun to increase the accuracy of artillery in battle, not to advance the state of the embryonic electronic computer.

Its fate was well described in a letter to Dr. [[Paul E. Klopsteg]], Head of NDRC Division 17, dated 6 February 1943 which concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

...As I said above, our entire Division is exceedingly reluctant to see a development which is scientifically so beautiful and so promising dropped at this point, though cold reason tells us that we cannot justify the expenditure of additional Government funds on the basis of Fire Control at this time.&lt;br /&gt;

In [[meteorology]], '''diurnal temperature variation''' is the variation between a high temperature and a low temperature that occurs during the same [[day]].

==Temperature lag==
Temperature lag is an important factor in diurnal temperature variation: peak daily temperature generally occurs ''after'' noon, as air keeps net absorbing heat even after noon, and similarly minimum daily temperature generally occurs substantially after midnight, indeed occurring during early morning in the hour around dawn, since heat is lost all night long. The analogous annual phenomenon is [[seasonal lag]].

As solar energy strikes the earth’s surface each morning, a shallow {{convert|1|-|3|cm|adj=on}} layer of air directly above the ground is heated by conduction. Heat exchange between this shallow layer of warm air and the cooler air above is very inefficient. On a warm summer’s day, for example, air temperatures may vary by {{convert|16.5|C-change|0}} from just above the ground to waist height. Incoming solar radiation exceeds outgoing heat energy for many hours after noon and equilibrium is usually reached from 3–5 p.m. but this may be affected by a variety of different things such as large bodies of water, soil type and cover, wind, cloud cover/water vapor, and moisture on the ground.&lt;ref name="Hackworth, Martin"&gt;[http://www.physics.isu.edu/weather/kmdbbd/notesc3.pdf M. Hackworth "Weather &amp; Climate" course notes, with prior permission] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012120014/http://www.physics.isu.edu/weather/kmdbbd/notesc3.pdf |date=October 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences in variation==
Diurnal temperature variations are greatest very near Earth's surface.

High desert regions typically have the greatest diurnal-temperature variations, while low-lying humid areas typically have the least. This explains why an area like the [[Snake River Plain]] can have high temperatures of {{convert|38|°C}} during a summer day, and then have lows of {{convert|5|-|10|C|F}}. At the same time, [[Washington D.C.]], which is much more humid, has temperature variations of only {{convert|8|C-change|0}};&lt;ref name="Hackworth, Martin"/&gt; urban [[Hong Kong]] has a diurnal temperature range of little more than {{convert|4|C-change|F-change|1}}.  

While the [[National Park Service]] claimed that the world single-day record is a variation of {{convert|102|F-change|C-change|1}} (from {{convert|46|F|C|1|disp=or}} to {{convert|&amp;minus;56|F|C|1|disp=or}}) in [[Browning, Montana]] in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/glac/naturescience/weather.htm Weather - Glacier National Park]&lt;/ref&gt; the Montana Department of Environmental Quality claimed that [[Loma, Montana]] also had a variation of {{convert|102|F-change|C-change|1}} (from {{convert|&amp;minus;54|F|C|1|disp=or}} to {{convert|48|F|C|1|disp=or}}) in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deq.mt.gov/ClimateChange/Data/FAQData.mcpx Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) - FAQ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728191103/http://deq.mt.gov/ClimateChange/Data/FAQData.mcpx |date=July 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viticulture==
Diurnal temperature variation is of particular importance in [[viticulture]]. [[Wine regions]] situated in areas of high [[altitude]] experience the most dramatic swing in temperature variation during the course of a day. In [[grape]]s, this variation has the effect of producing high [[acid]] and high [[sugar]] content as the grapes' exposure to [[sunlight]] increases the ripening qualities while the sudden drop in temperature at night preserves the balance of natural acids in the grape.&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 691"&gt;J. Robinson ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 691 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Drumian''' is a [[Stage (geology)|stage]] of the [[Miaolingian]] Series of the [[Cambrian]]. It succeeds the [[Wuliuan]] and precedes the [[Guzhangian]]. The base is defined as the first appearance of the [[trilobite]] ''[[Ptychagnostus atavus]]'' around {{Period start|Drumian}} million years ago. The top is defined as the first appearance of another trilobite ''[[Lejopyge laevigata]]'' around {{Period start|Guzhangian}} million years ago.

The [[GSSP]] is defined in the ''Drumian section'' ({{Coord|39.5117|N|112.9915|W|display=inline}}) in the [[Drum Mountains]], [[Millard County]], [[Utah]], United States.&lt;ref name="Babcock 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babcock|first=Loren E.|authorlink=Loren E.

The section is an outcrop of the [[Wheeler Formation]], a succession of calcareous shales. The precise base of the Drumian is a laminated limestone {{convert|62|m|abbr=on}} above the base of the Wheeler Formation.&lt;ref name="GSSP for Drumian Stage"&gt;{{cite web|title=GSSP for Drumian Stage|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/Stratigraphy/gssp/detail.php?periodid=149&amp;top_parentid=77|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ECHELON''', originally a secret government [[code name]], is a [[surveillance]] program ([[signals intelligence]]/SIGINT collection and analysis network) operated by the [[US]] with the aid of four other signatory nations to the [[UKUSA Agreement|UKUSA Security Agreement]]:&lt;ref name=pronunciation&gt;
Given the 5 dialects that use the terms, UKUSA can be pronounced from "You-Q-SA" to "Oo-Coo-SA", AUSCANNZUKUS can be pronounced from "Oz-Can-Zuke-Us" to "Orse-Can-Zoo-Cuss".
: From [[Talk:UKUSA Agreement]]: "Per documents officially released by both the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] and the [[National Security Agency]], this agreement is referred to as the UKUSA Agreement. This name is subsequently used by media sources reporting on the story, as written in new references used for the article. The NSA press release provides a pronunciation guide, indicating that "UKUSA" should not be read as two separate entities.{{cite web

The ECHELON program was created in the late 1960s to monitor the [[military]] and [[diplomatic]] communications of the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Eastern Bloc]] allies during the [[Cold War]], and it was formally established in 1971.&lt;ref name="bbcechelon1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: What you need to know about Echelon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/1357513.stm|publisher=BBC|date=29 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nabbali|first=Talitha|author2=Perry, Mark|title=Going for the throat|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|date=March 2004|volume=20|issue=2|pages=84–97|doi=10.1016/S0267-3649(04)00018-4|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364904000184|quote=It wasn't until 1971 that the UKUSA allies began ECHELON}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 20th century, the system referred to as "ECHELON" had evolved beyond its [[military]] and [[diplomatic]] origins to also become "&amp;hellip;a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications" (mass surveillance and [[industrial espionage]]).&lt;ref name=EP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+REPORT+A5-2001-0264+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&amp;language=EN |title=On the existence of a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications (ECHELON interception system), (2001/2098(INI)) |last=Schmid |first=Gerhard |date=11 July 2001 |format=pdf – 194 pages |publisher=European Parliament: Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System |accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The [[European Parliament]]'s [[Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System]] stated, "It seems likely, in view of the evidence and the consistent pattern of statements from a very wide range of individuals and organisations, including American sources, that its name is in fact '''ECHELON''', although this is a relatively minor detail".&lt;ref name=EP/&gt; The [[U.S. intelligence community]] uses many code names (''see'', for example, [[CIA cryptonym]]).

Former [[NSA]] employee [[Margaret Newsham]] claims that she worked on the configuration and installation of software that makes up the ECHELON system while employed at [[Lockheed Martin]], from 1974 to 1984 in [[Sunnyvale, California]], in the [[United States]], and in [[Menwith Hill]], [[England]], in the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= ECHELON Was My Baby |last=Elkjær |first=Bo |author2=Kenan Seeberg |work=Ekstra Bladet |url=http://cryptome.org/echelon-baby.htm |date=17 November 1999 |accessdate=17 May 2006}} "Unfortunately, I can't tell you all my duties. I am still bound by professional secrecy, and I would hate to go to prison or get involved in any trouble, if you know what I mean. In general, I can tell you that I was responsible for compiling the various systems and programs, configuring the whole thing and making it operational on mainframes"; "[[Margaret Newsham]] worked for the [[NSA]] through her employment at Ford and Lockheed from 1974 to 1984. In 1977 and 1978 Newsham was stationed at the largest listening post in the world at [[Menwith Hill]], [[England]] ... Ekstra Bladet has Margaret Newsham's stationing orders from the US Department of Defense. She possessed the high security classification TOP SECRET CRYPTO."&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, according to Newsham, the code name ECHELON was NSA's term for the computer network itself. Lockheed called it ''P415''. The software programs were called ''SILKWORTH'' and ''SIRE''. A [[satellite]] named ''[[Vortex (satellite)|VORTEX]]'' intercepted communications. An image available on the internet of a fragment apparently torn from a job description shows Echelon listed along with several other code names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodwins|first=Rupert|title=Echelon: How it works|url=http://www.zdnet.com/echelon-how-it-works-3002079849/|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=29 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=insideechelon&gt;{{cite web|last==Campbell|first=Duncan|title=Inside Echelon|url=http://www.zdnet.com/echelon-how-it-works-3002079849/|publisher=[[Heise Online]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=25 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper summarized the capabilities of the ECHELON system as follows:

{{quote|A global network of electronic spy stations that can eavesdrop on telephones, faxes and computers. It can even track bank accounts. This information is stored in Echelon computers, which can keep millions of records on individuals.

Officially, however, Echelon doesn't exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perrone|first=Jane|title=The Echelon spy network|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/29/qanda.janeperrone|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=29 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;!--
Documents leaked by the former [[NSA]] contractor [[Edward Snowden]] revealed that the ECHELON system's collection of [[satellite]] data is also referred to as '''FORNSAT''' - an abbreviation for "Foreign Satellite Collection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach and Holger Stark|title=Friendly Fire: How GCHQ Monitors Germany, Israel and the EU|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/snowden-documents-show-gchq-targeted-european-and-german-politicians-a-940135-2.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|quote=A map from the wealth of classified documents obtained by Snowden on the so-called "Fornsat" activities of the technical intelligence cooperation program -- informally known as the Five Eyes -- shows that the system of global satellite surveillance remained in operation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ambinder|first=Marc|title=What's XKEYSCORE?|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/247684/whats-xkeyscore|work=[[The Week]]|accessdate=30 January 2014|date=31 July 2013|quote=FORNSAT simply means "foreign satellite collection," which refers to NSA tapping into satellites that process data used by other countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reporting and disclosures ==

=== Public disclosures (1972–2000) ===
In 1972, former [[NSA]] analyst [[Perry Fellwock]] under pseudonym Winslow Peck, first blew the whistle on ECHELON to ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=Ramparts |volume=11 |number=2 |date=August 1972 |pages=35–50 |title=U.S. Electronic Espionage: A Memoir |author=David Horowitz }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he gave commentary revealing a global network of listening posts and his experiences working there. [[Perry Fellwock|Fellwock]] also included revelations such as the Israeli attack on {{USS|Liberty|AGTR-5|6}} was deliberate and known by both sides, the existence of [[nuclear weapons]] in [[Israel]] in 1972, the widespread involvement of [[CIA]] and [[NSA]] personnel in drugs and human smuggling, and [[CIA]] operatives leading Nationalist Chinese (Taiwan) commandos in burning villages inside [[PRC]] borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/jya/nsa-elint.htm|title=Ramparts interview |date=1988 |accessdate=April 21, 2017|publisher=Cryptome archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, [[James Bamford]], investigative journalist and author wrote ''The Puzzle Palace'', an in-depth look inside the workings of the [[NSA]], then a super-secret agency, and the massive eavesdropping operation under the codename "SHAMROCK". The [[NSA]] has used many [[code name|codenames]], and SHAMROCK was the [[code name]] used for ECHELON prior to 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bamford |first=James |title=The Puzzle Palace: A Report on America's Most Secret Agency |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0-14-006748-5 |date=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Echelon reference timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/jya/echelon-dc.htm|title=Puzzle Palace excepts|accessdate=April 21, 2017|publisher=Cryptome archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, [[Margaret Newsham]], a [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] employee under [[NSA]] contract, disclosed the ECHELON [[surveillance]] system to members of congress. [[Margaret Newsham|Newsham]] told a member of the [[U.S. Congress]] that the telephone calls of [[Strom Thurmond]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] U.S. senator, were being collected by the [[NSA]]. Congressional investigators determined that "targeting of U.S. political figures would not occur by accident, but was designed into the system from the start."&lt;ref name="duncan1" /&gt;

Also in 1988, an article titled "Somebody's Listening", written by investigative journalist [[Duncan Campbell (journalist)|Duncan Campbell]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', described the [[signals intelligence]] gathering activities of a program code-named "ECHELON".&lt;ref name="duncan1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Campbell |first=Duncan |authorlink=Duncan Campbell (journalist) |title=Somebody's Listening |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |date=12 August 1988 |url=http://www.duncancampbell.org/menu/journalism/newstatesman/newstatesman-1988/They%27ve%20got%20it%20taped.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Bamford]] describes the system as the software controlling the collection and distribution of civilian [[telecommunications]] traffic conveyed using communication satellites, with the collection being undertaken by ground stations located in the footprint of the downlink leg.&lt;ref name=Bamford&gt;{{cite book |last=Bamford |first=James |title=Body of Secrets |publisher=Anchor |isbn=0-385-49908-6 |date=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed description of ECHELON was provided by [[New Zealand]] journalist [[Nicky Hager]] in his 1996 book ''[[Nicky Hager#Secret Power|Secret Power: New Zealand's Role in the International Spy Network]]''.&lt;ref name=heiseeche&gt;{{cite web|last=Duncan Campbell|title=Echelon Chronology|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/7/7795/1.html|publisher=[[Heise Online]]|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=1 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, [[Nicky Hager|Hager's]] book was cited by the [[European Parliament]] in a report titled "An Appraisal of the Technology of Political Control" (PE 168.184).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Steve|title=An Appraisal of Technologies of Political Control|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/jadis/2013_12/8.PE4_AP_PV!LIBE.1994_LIBE-199801260050EN.pdf|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=6 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1999, for the first time in history, the [[Australian government]] admitted that news reports about the top secret [[UKUSA Agreement]] were true.&lt;ref name="zdnetduncan" /&gt; [[Martin Brady]], the director of Australia's [[Defence Signals Directorate]] (DSD, now known as Australian Signals Directorate, or ASD) told the [[Australia]]n broadcasting channel [[Nine Network]] that the DSD "does co-operate with counterpart [[signals intelligence]] organisations overseas under the [[UKUSA Agreement|UKUSA relationship]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duncan Campbell and Mark Honigsbaum|title=Britain and US spy on world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/23/duncancampbell.markhonigsbaum|work=[[The Observer]] |accessdate=19 December 2013|date=23 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[R. James Woolsey, Jr.|James Woolsey]], the former Director of the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]], confirmed that [[U.S.]] intelligence uses interception systems and keyword searches to monitor [[Europe]]an businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=R.

Lawmakers in the [[United States]] feared that the ECHELON system could be used to monitor U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name="echenytimes" /&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ECHELON system has been "shrouded in such secrecy that its very existence has been difficult to prove."&lt;ref name="echenytimes"&gt;{{cite news|author=Niall McKay|title=Lawmakers Raise Questions About International Spy Network|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/05/cyber/articles/27network.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=27 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics said the ECHELON system emerged from the [[Cold War]] as a "Big Brother without a cause".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Suzanne Daley|title=An Electronic Spy Scare Is Alarming Europe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/02/biztech/articles/24spy.htm l|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=24 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Parliament investigation (2000–2001)===
[[File:Nicky Hager at European Parliament April 2001b.jpg|thumb|The New Zealand journalist [[Nicky Hager]], who testified before the [[European Parliament]] and provided specific details about the ECHELON [[surveillance]] system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kieren McCarthy|title=This is how we know Echelon exists|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/09/14/this_is_how_we_know/|work=[[The Register]]|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=14 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The program's capabilities and political implications were investigated by a committee of the [[European Parliament]] during 2000 and 2001 with a report published in 2001.&lt;ref name="EP"/&gt; In July 2000, the [[Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System]] was established by the [[European parliament]] to investigate the [[surveillance]] network. It was chaired by the Portuguese politician [[Carlos Coelho]], who was in charge of supervising investigations throughout 2000 and 2001.

In May 2001, as the committee finalised its report on the ECHELON system, a delegation travelled to [[Washington, D.C.]] to attend meetings with [[U.S.]] officials from the following agencies and departments:
* U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA)&lt;ref name="bbcusech"/&gt;
* U.S. [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] (DOC)&lt;ref name="bbcusech"/&gt;
* U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA)&lt;ref name="bbcusech"/&gt;

All meetings were cancelled by the [[U.S. government]] and the committee was forced to end its trip prematurely.&lt;ref name="bbcusech"&gt;{{cite news|last=Roxburgh|first=Angus|title=EU investigators 'snubbed' in US|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1325186.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=11 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[BBC]] correspondent in May 2001, "The US Government still refuses to admit that Echelon even exists."&lt;ref name="bbcechelon1"/&gt;

In July 2001, the [[Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System]] released its final report.&lt;ref name="EUechelon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the existence of a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications (ECHELON interception system) (2001/2098(INI))|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&amp;reference=A5-2001-0264&amp;format=XML&amp;language=EN|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|date=11 July 2001|accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 September 2001, the [[European Parliament]] voted to accept the committee's report.&lt;ref name=apechelonusa&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Echelon exists, should be guarded against|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2001-09-05-echelon.htm|accessdate=7 February 2014|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=5 September 2001|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Parliament]] stated in its report that the term ECHELON is used in a number of contexts, but that the evidence presented indicates that it was the name for a [[signals intelligence]] collection system. The report concludes that, on the basis of information presented, ECHELON was capable of interception and content inspection of [[telephone]] calls, [[fax]], [[e-mail]] and other data traffic globally through the interception of communication bearers including [[satellite]] transmission, [[public switched telephone network]]s (which once carried most Internet traffic), and [[microwave]] links.&lt;ref name=EP/&gt;

=== Confirmation of ECHELON (2015) ===
Two internal [[NSA]] newsletters from January 2011 and July 2012, published as part of the [[Edward Snowden|Snowden]]-revelations by the website ''[[The Intercept]]'' on 3 August 2015, for the first time confirmed that [[NSA]] used the [[code word]] ECHELON and provided some details about the scope of the program: ECHELON was part of an umbrella program [[code name]]d FROSTING, which was established by the [[NSA]] in 1966 to collect and process data from [[communications satellites]]. FROSTING had two sub-programs:&lt;ref name=yrs&gt;The Northwest Passage, Yakima Research Station (YRS) newsletter: [http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2189960-nwp-nsa.html Volume 2, Issue 1, January 2011] &amp; [http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2189961-nwp2-nsa.html Volume 3, Issue 7, July 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;
* TRANSIENT: for intercepting [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] satellite transmissions
* ECHELON: for intercepting [[Intelsat]] satellite transmissions

==Organization==
{{UKUSA}}
The [[UKUSA Agreement|UKUSA intelligence community]] was assessed by the [[European Parliament]] (EP) in 2000 to include the [[signals intelligence]] agencies of each of the member states:
* the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] of the United Kingdom,
* the [[National Security Agency]] of the United States,
* the [[Communications Security Establishment]] of Canada,
* the [[Australian Signals Directorate]] of Australia, and
* the [[Government Communications Security Bureau]] of New Zealand.
The EP report concluded that it seemed likely that ECHELON is a method of sorting captured signal traffic, rather than a comprehensive analysis tool.&lt;ref name=EP/&gt;

===Likely satellite intercept stations===
In 2001, the [[European Parliament|EP]] report (p.&amp;nbsp;54 ff)&lt;ref name=EP/&gt; listed the following ground stations as likely to have, or to have had, a role in intercepting transmissions from telecommunications satellites:

== History and context ==
The ability to intercept communications depends on the medium used, be it [[radio]], [[satellite]], [[microwave]], [[cellular network|cellular]] or [[Optical fiber|fiber-optic]].&lt;ref name = EP/&gt; During [[World War II]] and through the 1950s, [[high frequency|high-frequency]] ("short-wave") radio was widely used for [[military]] and [[diplomatic]] communication&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Codebreakers]]'', Ch. 10, 11&lt;/ref&gt; and could be intercepted at great distances.&lt;ref name = EP/&gt; The rise of [[geostationary]] [[communications satellites]] in the 1960s presented new possibilities for intercepting international communications.

In 1964, plans for the establishment of the ECHELON [[Telecommunications network|network]] took off after dozens of countries agreed to establish the [[International Telecommunications Satellite Organisation]] (Intelsat), which would own and operate a global constellation of [[communications satellite]]s.&lt;ref name="zdnetduncan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Duncan Campbell|title=Echelon: World under watch, an introduction|url=http://www.zdnet.com/echelon-world-under-watch-an-introduction-3002079845/|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Echelon-yakima-02.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Equipment at the Yakima Research Station (YRS) in the early days of the ECHELON program]]
[[File:Echelon-yakima-01.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Teletype operators at the Yakima Research Station (YRS) in the early days of the ECHELON program]]
In 1966, the first [[Intelsat]] [[satellite]] was launched into orbit. From 1970 to 1971, the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] began to operate a secret signal station  at [[Morwenstow]], near [[Bude]] in [[Cornwall]], [[England]]. The station intercepted [[satellite communications]] over the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s. Soon afterwards, the [[U.S.]] [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) built a second signal station at [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]], near [[Seattle]], for the interception of satellite communications over the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name="zdnetduncan"/&gt;

In 1981, [[GCHQ]] and the [[NSA]] started the construction of the first global [[wide area network]] (WAN). Soon after [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and [[New Zealand]] joined the ECHELON system.&lt;ref name="zdnetduncan"/&gt; The report to the [[European Parliament]] of 2001 states: "If [[UKUSA]] states operate listening stations in the relevant regions of the earth, in principle they can intercept all [[telephone]], [[fax]], and data traffic transmitted via such satellites."&lt;ref name = EP/&gt;

Most reports on ECHELON focus on satellite interception. Testimony before the [[European Parliament]] indicated that separate but similar [[UKUSA]] systems are in place to monitor communication through undersea cables, microwave transmissions, and other lines.&lt;ref name=Hager&gt;For example: {{cite web |url=http://cryptome.org/echelon-nh.htm |title=Nicky Hager Appearance before the Euro ean Parliament ECHELON Committee |date=April 2001 |accessdate=2 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report to the [[European Parliament]] points out that interception of private communications by foreign intelligence services is not necessarily limited to the [[U.S.]] or [[United Kingdom|British]] foreign intelligence services.&lt;ref name = EP/&gt;

The role of satellites in point-to-point voice and data communications has largely been supplanted by [[fiber optics]]. In 2006, 99% of the world's long-distance voice and data traffic was carried over [[fiber optics|optical-fiber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.cnet.com/NSA+eavesdropping+How+it+might+work/2100-1028_3-6035910.html | title=NSA eavesdropping: How it might work | work=CNET News.com | accessdate=27 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of international communications accounted for by [[satellite]] links is said to have decreased substantially to an amount between 0.4% and 5% in Central Europe.&lt;ref name = EP/&gt; Even in less-developed parts of the world, [[communications satellites]] are used largely for point-to-multipoint applications, such as video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.marketresearch.com/map/prod/1117944.html | title=Commercial Geostationary Satellite Transponder Markets for Latin America : Market Research Report | accessdate=27 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the majority of communications can no longer be intercepted by earth stations; they can only be collected by tapping cables and intercepting line-of-sight [[microwave]] signals, which is possible only to a limited extent.&lt;ref name = EP/&gt;

==Concerns==
[[British people|British]] journalist [[Duncan Campbell (investigative journalist)|Duncan Campbell]] and [[New Zealand]] journalist [[Nicky Hager]] asserted in the 1990s that the [[United States]] was exploiting ECHELON traffic for [[industrial espionage]], rather than [[military]] and [[diplomatic]] purposes.&lt;ref name=Hager/&gt; Examples alleged by the journalists include the gear-less wind turbine technology designed by the [[Germany|German]] firm [[Enercon]]&lt;ref name=EP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Die Zeit: 40/1999 "''Verrat unter Freunden''{{-"}} ("Treachery among friends", German), available at {{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/1999/40/199940.nsa_2_.xml |title=Zeit.de |accessdate=2007-08-19 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009044725/http://www.zeit.de/1999/40/199940.nsa_2_.xml |archivedate=9 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the speech technology developed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] firm [[Lernout &amp; Hauspie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daanspeak.com/Hypocratie09.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66Jmuc30R?url=http://www.daanspeak.com/Hypocratie09.html |archivedate=21 March 2012 |date=30 March 2002 |title=Amerikanen maakten met Echelon L&amp;H kapot |accessdate=28 March 2008 |publisher=daanspeak.com |deadurl=no |df=dmy }} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=nl&amp;u=http://www.daanspeak.com/Hypocratie09.html&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Google's translation of the article into English]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System recommended to the [[European Parliament]] that citizens of member states routinely use [[cryptography]] in their communications to protect their privacy, because [[economic espionage]] with ECHELON has been conducted by the [[U.S.]] intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name = EP/&gt;

American author [[James Bamford]] provides an alternative view, highlighting that legislation prohibits the use of intercepted communications for commercial purposes, although he does not elaborate on how intercepted communications are used as part of an all-source intelligence process.

In its report, the committee of the [[European Parliament]] stated categorically that the Echelon network was being used to intercept not only military communications, but also private and business ones. In its epigraph to the report, the parliamentary committee quoted [[Juvenal]], "''Sed quis custodiet ipsos custodes''.{{-"}} ("But who will watch the watchers").&lt;ref name = EP/&gt; [[James Bamford]], in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in May 2001, warned that if Echelon were to continue unchecked, it could become a "cyber secret police, without courts, juries, or the right to a defence".&lt;ref&gt;Bustillos, Maria (9 June 2013).

* The U.S. [[National Security Agency]] spied on and intercepted the phone calls of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] right until she died in a [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|Paris car crash with Dodi Fayed]] in 1997. The [[NSA]] currently holds 1,056 pages of classified information about [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]], which has been classified as [[Classified information|top secret]] "because their disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the [[national security]] ... the damage would be caused not by the information about [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana]], but because the documents would disclose 'sources and methods' of U.S. intelligence gathering".&lt;ref name=Diana01a&gt;{{cite news|last=Vernon Loeb|title=NSA Admits to Spying on Princess Diana|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/dec98/diana12.htm|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=12 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official insisted that "the references to Diana in intercepted conversations were 'incidental'," and she was never a 'target' of the NSA eavesdropping.&lt;ref name=Diana01a/&gt;

The first American [[satellite]] ground station for the ECHELON collection program was built in 1971 at a military firing and training center near [[Yakima, Washington]]. The facility, which was codenamed JACKKNIFE, was an investment of ca. 21.3 million dollars and had around 90 people. [[Satellite]] traffic was intercepted by a 30-meter single dish antenna. The station became fully operational on 4 October 1974. It was connected with [[NSA]] headquarters at Fort Meade by a 75-baud secure Teletype orderwire channel.&lt;ref name=yrs /&gt;

In 1999 the [[Australian Senate]] Joint Standing Committee on Treaties was told by Professor [[Desmond Ball]] that the [[Pine Gap]] facility was used as a ground station for a satellite-based interception network. The satellites were said to be large radio dishes between 20 and 100 meters in diameter in [[geostationary orbit]]s. The original purpose of the network was to monitor the [[telemetry]] from 1970s [[:Category:Cold War weapons of the Soviet Union|Soviet weapons]], air defence and other radars' capabilities, satellites' ground stations' transmissions and ground-based [[Microwave transmission|microwave communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/joint/commttee/j2408.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608040058/http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/joint/commttee/j2408.pdf |archive-date=8 June 2011 |title=Pine Gap |dead-url=yes |accessdate=19 August 2016}}, Official Committee Hansard, Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, 9 August 1999.

=== Examples of industrial espionage ===
In 1999, Enercon, a [[Germany|German]] company and leading manufacturer of wind energy equipment, developed a breakthrough generator for wind turbines. After applying for a [[US]] patent, it had learned that Kenetech, an American rival, had submitted an almost identical patent application shortly before. By the statement of a former [[NSA]] employee, it was later discovered that the [[NSA]] had secretly intercepted and monitored [[Enercon]]'s data communications and conference calls and passed information regarding the new generator to Kenetech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/program/process/rapport_echelon_en.pdf|title=Report on the existence of a global system for the interception of private and commercial communications (ECHELON interception system)  (2001/2098(INI))|last=Schmid|first=Gerhard|date=2001-07-11|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As German intelligence services are forbidden from engaging in industrial or economic espionage, German companies are frequently complaining that this leaves them defenceless against industrial espionage from the United States. According to Wolfgang Hoffmann, a former manager at [[Bayer]], German intelligence services are aware which companies are being targeted by US intelligence agencies, but refuse to inform the companies involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/electronic-spies-torture-german-firms-1.174447|title=Electronic spies torture German firms|last=Staunton|first=Denis|date=1999-04-16|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The television series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' made recurring references to ECHELON throughout its run.

The antagonist of the anime series ''[[Digimon Tamers]]'', D-Reaper, was created by ECHELON.

''[[Echelon Conspiracy]]'', inspired by the surveillance system ECHELON, is a 2009 [[action thriller]] film directed by [[Greg Marcks]]. It tells the story of Max Peterson ([[Shane West]]), an American computer specialist who attempts to uncover a secret plot to turn the world into a global [[police state]]. After being chased down by [[NSA]] agent Raymond Burke ([[Martin Sheen]]), Peterson decides to flee to [[Moscow]].

The video game series ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'' also draws inspiration from this. The series features the protagonist, [[Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell)|Sam Fisher]], a trained operative belonging to a fictional branch of the [[National Security Agency]] called Third Echelon (later, in ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist|Splinter Cell: Blacklist]]'', the unit is replaced by the Fourth Echelon).

The 2007 film ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' makes several references to ECHELON. A CIA listening station in London is alerted when ECHELON detects the keyword "Blackbriar" in a cell phone conversation between a journalist and his editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gunn|first=Angela|title=Security goes to the movies: The Bourne Ultimatum|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9029059/Security_goes_to_the_movies_i_The_Bourne_Ultimatum_i_|work=Computerworld|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the film, [[CIA]] Deputy Director Pamela Landy requests an "ECHELON package" on the main character, [[Jason Bourne]].

In the 2000 computer game ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'', the signals intelligence supercomputers [[Daedalus]] and [[Icarus]] (later Helios) are referred to as Echelon IV.

The sci-fi crime thriller, ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'', a television show which aired from 2011 to 2016 on the [[CBS network]], had a data-collecting supercomputer as its central narrative.

In ''[[Steins;Gate]]'' SERN  monitors if someone sends a D-mail through ECHELON.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16775">'''Earth systems engineering and management''' (ESEM) is a discipline used to analyze, design, engineer and manage complex [[Natural environment|environmental]] [[system]]s. It entails a wide range of subject areas including [[anthropology]], [[engineering]], [[environmental science]], [[ethics]] and [[philosophy]]. At its core, ESEM looks to "rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion" &lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"&gt;Gorman, Michael. (2004). ''Syllabus Spring Semester 2004''. Retrieved October 29, 2005 from http://repo-nt.tcc.virginia.edu/classes/ESEM/syllabus.html.&lt;/ref&gt; ESEM is a newly emerging area of study that has taken root at the University of Virginia, Cornell and other universities throughout the United States. Founders of Earth Systems Engineering &amp; Management are [[Braden Allenby]] and Michael Gorman.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Michael Gorman is currently a professor at the University of Virginia. He is with the School of Engineering and Applied Science in the department of Science, Technology and Society.  He teaches STS 300, Earth Systems Engineering &amp; Management, STS 401, Western Technology and Culture and STS 402, The Engineer in Society. Dr. Gorman's research interests include experimental simulations of scientific reasoning, described in his book Simulating Science (Indiana UP, 1992) and case studies of ethics, invention and discovery, which are described in his book Transforming Nature (Kluwer, 1998). He is the faculty advisor for a graduate program,  Societal and Ethical Dimensions of Systems Engineering.

In the UK, the [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceser Centre for Earth Systems Engineering Research] (CESER) at Newcastle University has a large ESEM programme, led by [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceg/staff/profile/richard.dawson Professor Richard Dawson].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceg/staff/profile/richard.dawson Richard Dawson] is Professor of Earth Systems Engineering at Newcastle University and Director of the Centre for Earth Systems Engineering Research.  His work has focused on developing adaptation solutions to ensure of structure and cities are resilient and sustainable in the face of intensifying global change.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction to ESEM==
For centuries now, mankind has been utilizing the earth and its natural resources to advance civilization and develop technology.  "As a principle {{sic}} result of Industrial Revolutions and associated changes in human demographics, technology systems, cultures, and economic systems have been the evolution of an Earth in which the dynamics of major natural systems are increasingly dominated by human activity".&lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"/&gt;

In many ways, ESEM views the earth as a human artifact. "In order to maintain continued stability of both natural and human systems, we need to develop the ability to rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion- an Earth Systems Engineering and Management (ESEM) capability".&lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"/&gt; 

Over the past five years, the concept of Earth Systems Engineering and Management has been developed by a few individuals. One of particular note is [[Braden Allenby]].  Allenby holds that the foundation upon which ESEM is built is the notion that “the Earth, as it now exists, is a product of human design”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"&gt;* Allenby, B. R. (2005). Reconstructing earth : Technology and environment in the age of humans. Washington, DC: Island Press. From https://www.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip059/2005006241.html&lt;/ref&gt; In fact there are no longer any natural systems left in the world, “there are no places left on Earth that don’t fall under humanity’s shadow”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2000"&gt;Allenby, B. R. (2000, Winter). Earth systems engineering and management. IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 0278-0079(Winter) 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; “So the question is not, as some might wish, whether we should begin ESEM, because we have been doing it for a long time, albeit unintentionally.

The issue is whether we will assume the ethical responsibility to do ESEM rationally and responsibly”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; Unlike the traditional engineering and management process “which assume a high degree of knowledge and certainty about the systems behavior and a defined endpoint to the process,” ESEM “will be in constant dialog with [the systems], as they – and we and our cultures – change and coevolve together into the future”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; ESEM is a new concept, however there are a number of fields “such as [[industrial ecology]], [[adaptive management]], and [[systems engineering]] that can be relied on to enable rapid progress in developing” ESEM as a discipline.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt;

The premise of ESEM is that science and technology can provide successful and lasting solutions to human-created problems such as environmental pollution and climate-change.  This assumption has recently been challenged in ''Techno-Fix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ESEM, as all technological control and manipulation, causes unintended and inherently unavoidable negative consequences. Furthermore, due to the limitations of reductionist science, it is inherently impossible to predict all negative impacts of ESEM. Consequently, ESEM can be considered a high-risk technological fix, which attempts to address symptoms of the planetary environmental crisis rather than root causes, which are dysfunctional human behavior such as [[human overpopulation]] and [[overconsumption]].

==ESEM: Topics==
=== Adaptive management ===
[[Adaptive management]] is a key aspect of ESEM.  Adaptive management is a way of approaching environmental management.  It assumes that there is a great deal of uncertainty in environmental systems and holds that there is never a final solution to an earth systems problem.  Therefore, once action has been taken, the Earth Systems Engineer will need to be in constant dialogue with the system, watching for changes and how the system evolves. This way of monitoring and managing ecosystems accepts nature's inherent uncertainty and embraces it by never concluding to one certain cure to a problem.

===Earth Systems Engineering===
Earth [[Systems engineering]] is essentially the use of systems analysis methods in the examination of environmental problems.  When analyzing complex environmental systems, there are numerous data sets, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and variables.  It is therefore appropriate to approach such problems with a systems analysis method.  Essentially there are “six major phases of a properly-conducted system study”.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"&gt;* Gibson, J. E. (1991). How to do A systems analysis and systems analyst decalog. In W. T. Scherer (Ed.), (Fall 2003 ed.) (pp. 29-238). Department of Systems and Information Engineering: U of Virginia. Retrieved October 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The six phases are as follows:
#Determine Goals of System
#Establish Criteria for Ranking Alternative Candidates
#Develop Alternatives Solutions
#Rank Alternative Candidates
#Iterate
#Action

Part of the systems analysis process includes determining the goals of the system.  The key components of goal development include the development of a Descriptive Scenario, a Normative Scenario and Transitive Scenario.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt; Essentially, the Descriptive Scenario “describe[s] the situation as it is [and] tell[s] how it got to be that way” (Gibson, 1991).  Another important part of the Descriptive Scenario is how it “point[s] out the good features and the unacceptable elements of the status quo”.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt; Next, the Normative Scenario shows the final outcome or the way the system should operate under ideal conditions once action has been taken.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt;  For the Earth Systems approach, the “Normative Scenario” will involve the most complicated analysis.  The Normative Scenario will deal with stakeholders, creating a common trading zone or location for the free exchange of ideas to come up with a solution of where a system may be restored to or just how exactly a system should be modified.  Finally the Transitive scenario comes up with the actual process of changing a system from a Descriptive state to a Normative state.  Often, there is not one final solution, as noted in [[adaptive management]].  Typically an iterative process ensues as variables and inputs change and the system coevolves with the analysis.

===Environmental science===
{{main|Environmental science}}
When examining complex ecologic systems there is an inherent need for the Earth Systems Engineer to have a strong understanding of how natural processes function.  A training in Environmental Science will be crucial to fully understand the possible unintended and undesired effects of a proposed earth systems design.  Such fundamental topics such as the carbon cycle or the [[water cycle]] are pivotal processes that need to be understood.

===Ethics &amp; Sustainability===
At the heart of ESEM is the social, ethical and moral responsibility of the Earth Systems Engineer to stakeholders and to the natural system being engineered, to come up with an objective Transitive and Normative scenario.  “ESEM is the cultural and ethical context itself”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; The Earth Systems Engineer will be expected to explore the ethical implications of proposed solutions.

“The perspective of environmental sustainability requires that we ask ourselves how each interaction with the natural environment will affect, and be judged by, our children in the future” ”.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"&gt;Newton, L. H. (2003). Ethics and sustainability : Sustainable development and the moral life. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; “There is an increasing awareness that the process of development, left to itself, can cause irreversible damage to the environment, and that the resultant net addition to wealth and human welfare may very well be negative, if not catastrophic”.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"/&gt;  With this notion in mind, there is now a new goal of sustainable environment-friendly development.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"/&gt; [[Sustainable development]] is an important part to developing appropriate ESEM solutions to complex environmental problems.

===Industrial ecology===
{{main|Industrial ecology}}
Industrial ecology is the notion that major manufacturing and industrial processes need to shift from open loop systems to closed loop systems. This is essentially the recycling of waste to make new products.  This reduces refuse and increases the effectiveness of resources.  ESEM looks to minimize the impact of industrial processes on the environment, therefore the notion of recycling of industrial products is important to ESEM.

==Case Study: Florida Everglades==
The [[Florida Everglades]] system is a prime example of a complex ecological system that underwent an ESEM analysis.

;Background
The Florida Everglades is located in southern Florida.  The ecosystem is essentially a subtropical fresh water marsh composed of a variety of flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="Everglades, 2004"&gt;“Everglades.” Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. 10 April 2004. {{cite web |url=http://www.evergladesplan.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214102114/http://www.evergladesplan.org/ |archivedate=2005-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note is the [[saw grass]] and ridge slough formations that make the Everglades unique.&lt;ref name="Davis, 1997"&gt;(Davis, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of the past century mankind has had a rising presence in this region.  Currently, all of the eastern shore of Florida is developed and the population has increased to over 6 million residents.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt; This increased presence over the years has resulted in the channeling and redirecting of water from its traditional path through the Everglades and into the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.  With this there have been a variety of deleterious effects upon the Florida Everglades.

;Descriptive Scenario
By 1993, the Everglades had been affected by numerous human developments.  The water flow and quality had been affected by the construction of canals and levees, to the series of elevated highways running through the Everglades to the expansive Everglades Agricultural Area that had contaminated the Everglades with high amounts of nitrogen.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  The result of this reduced flow of water was dramatic. There was a 90 - 95% reduction in wading bird populations, declining fish populations and salt water intrusion into the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Davis, 1997"/&gt; If the Florida Everglades were to remain a US landmark, action needed to be taken.

;Normative Scenario
It was in 1993 that the Army Corps of Engineers analyzed the system.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  They determined that an ideal situation would be to "get the water right".&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt; In doing so there would be a better flow through the Everglades and a reduced number of canals and levees sending water to tide.

;Transitive Scenario
It was from the development of the Normative Scenario, that the Army Corps of Engineers developed CERP, the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  In the plan they created a time line of projects to be completed, the estimated cost and the ultimate results of improving the ecosystem by having native flora and fauna prosper.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  They also outline the human benefits of the project.  Not only will the solution be sustainable, as future generations will be able to enjoy the Everglades, but the correction of the water flow and through the creation of storage facilities will reduce the occurrence of droughts and water shortages in southern Florida.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;

The [[energy policy]] of [[Malaysia]] is determined by the [[Malaysian Government]], which address issues of energy production, distribution, and consumption. The Department of Electricity and Gas Supply acts as the regulator while other players in the energy sector include energy supply and service companies, research and development institutions and consumers. Government-linked companies [[Petronas]] and [[Tenaga Nasional|Tenaga Nasional Berhad]] are major players in Malaysia's energy sector.

Governmental agencies that contribute to the policy are the Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water, [[Energy Commission of Malaysia|Energy Commission (Suruhanjaya Tenaga)]], and the Malaysia Energy Centre (Pusat Tenaga Malaysia).  Among the documents that the [[Energy policy|policy]] is based on are the 1974 Petroleum Development Act, 1975 National Petroleum Policy, 1980 National Depletion Policy, 1990 Electricity Supply Act, 1993 Gas Supply Acts, 1994 Electricity Regulations, 1997 Gas Supply Regulation and the 2001 Energy Commission Act.&lt;ref name="ktthaNEP"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Energy Policy |url=http://www.kttha.gov.my/template01.asp?contentid=19 |work=Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water |publisher= |date=31 January 2008 |accessdate=25 May 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy overview ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}

[[File:Oil Balance Malaysia.svg|thumb|Malaysia's oil production no longer fulfills its needs.]]

The Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water has identified three principal energy objectives that would be instrumental in guiding the development of its energy sector.&lt;ref name="ktthaNEP" /&gt;

=== Supply ===
To ensure the provision of adequate, secure and cost-effective energy supplies through developing indigenous [[energy resource]]s both [[Non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] and [[Renewable resource|renewable energy resources]] using the latest cost options and diversification of supply sources both from within and outside the country.

In pursuit of the supply objective, policy initiatives, particularly with respect to [[crude oil]] and natural gas,Malaysia have aimed at both extending the life of domestic non-renewable energy resources, as well as diversification away from oil dependence to include other forms of energy sources.

=== Utilisation ===
To promote the [[Efficient energy use|efficient utilisation]] of energy and discourage wasteful and non-productive patterns of energy consumption.

The policy's approach to realise this objective is to rely heavily on the energy industry and consumers to exercise efficiency in energy production, transportation, [[energy conversion]], utilisation and consumption through the implementation of awareness programs. [[Demand side management]] initiatives by the utilities, particularly through [[Electricity tariff|tariff]] incentives, have had some impact on efficient utilisation and consumption.

Government initiatives to encourage [[cogeneration]] are also aimed at promoting an efficient method for generating heat energy and electricity from a single energy source.

=== Environmental ===
To minimise the negative impacts of [[energy production]], transportation, conversion, utilisation and consumption on the [[Natural environment|environment]].

The environment objective has seen limited policy initiatives in the past. All major energy development projects are subjected to the mandatory [[environmental impact assessment]] requirement. Environmental consequences, such as [[Air pollution|emissions]], discharges and [[Noise pollution|noise]] are subjected to the environmental quality standards like air quality and emission standards.

== Renewable energy policy ==
&lt;!-- Renewable energy in Malaysia redirects here --&gt;
The Malaysian government is seeking to intensify the development of [[renewable energy]], particularly [[biomass]], as the 'fifth fuel' resource under the country's Fuel Diversification Policy. The policy, which was set out in 2001, had a target of renewable energy providing 5% of electricity generation by 2005, equal to between 500 and 600 [[megawatt]] (MW) of installed capacity. The policy has been reinforced by fiscal [[incentives]], such as investment tax allowances and the Small Renewable Energy Programme (SREP), which encourages the connection of small renewable power generation plants to the [[National Grid, Malaysia|national grid]].&lt;ref name="bmi2008"&gt;Business Monitor International (February 2008). "Malaysia Power Report Q2 2008", London,UK: Business Monitor International.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Small Renewable Energy Program allows renewable projects with up to 10 MW of capacity to sell
their electricity output to TNB, under 21-year licence agreements. Numerous applications for the
program have been received, mainly involving biomass, and of these over half are for [[palm oil]] waste.
In 2005 there were 28 approved biomass projects involving the installation of 194 MW of grid-connected
capacity. There were also four approved [[landfill gas]]-based projects, with 9 MW of capacity, and 18 [[Small hydro|mini
hydro-electric]] projects offering 69.9 MW of total capacity.&lt;ref name="bmi2008" /&gt;

Currently (2016), the Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA) of Malaysia is conducting a comprehensive onshore wind mapping effort. SEDA Malaysia is a statutory body formed under the Sustainable Energy Development Authority Act of 2011. One of the key roles of the SEDA is to administer and manage the implementation of the Feed-in Tariff(FiT) mechanism, including a Renewable Energy fund mandated under the Renewable Energy Act of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://seda.gov.my/&lt;/ref&gt; The Renewable Energy fund was created to support the FiT scheme. The current onshore wind mapping exercise will determine whether wind energy should be included in the FiT regime &lt;ref name="Renew. Sustain.

==Production and consumption==
Traditionally, energy production in Malaysia has been based around oil and natural gas.&lt;ref name="Unimap"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publicweb.unimap.edu.my/~ppkas/home/index.php/news/articles/29-renewable-energy-and-kyoto-protocol-adoption-in-malaysia |title=Renewable Energy and Kyoto Protocol: Adoption in Malaysia |publisher=Publicweb.unimap.edu.my |date= |accessdate=24 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430012655/http://publicweb.unimap.edu.my/~ppkas/home/index.php/news/articles/29-renewable-energy-and-kyoto-protocol-adoption-in-malaysia |archivedate=30 April 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia currently has 13GW of electrical generation capacity.&lt;ref name="GENI"&gt;{{cite web|author=Global Energy Network Institute 1-619-595-0139 |url=http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/national_energy_grid/malaysia/index.shtml |title=National Energy Grid of Malaysia – National Electricity Transmission Grid of Malaysia |publisher=Geni.org |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power generation capacity connected to the [[National Grid, Malaysia|Malaysian National Grid]] is 19,023 MW, with a maximum demand of 13,340 MW as of July 2007 according to Suruhanjaya Tenaga.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the country as a whole consumes 514 thousand barrels (23.6 million tonnes) of oil daily against a production of 755 thousand barrels (34.2 million tonnes) per day.&lt;ref name="bp2008"&gt;{{cite web | title=BP Statistical Review of World Energy June 2008 | url=http://www.bp.com/statisticalreview | work=BP plc | publisher= | date=June 2008 | accessdate=25 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Malaysia only has 33 years of natural gas reserves, and 19 years of oil reserves, whilst the demand for energy is increasing. Due to this the Malaysian government is expanding into renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name="Unimap"/&gt; Currently 16% of Malaysian electricity generation is hydroelectric, the remaining 84% being thermal.&lt;ref name="GENI"/&gt; The oil and gas industry in Malaysia is currently dominated by state owned [[Petronas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/Malaysia/Profile.html |title=U.S. Energy Information Administration Independent Statistics and Analysis Malaysia |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |year=2009 |accessdate=24 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930052756/http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/Malaysia/Profile.html |archivedate=30 September 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the energy sector as a whole is regulated by [[Suruhanjaya Tenaga]], a statutory commission who governs the energy in the peninsula and Sabah, under the terms of the Electricity Commission Act of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.st.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2388&amp;Itemid=1689&amp;lang=en |title=Overview of Energy Commission |publisher=St.gov.my |date= |accessdate=24 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007190151/http://www.st.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2388&amp;Itemid=1689&amp;lang=en |archivedate=7 October 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy efficiency ==

Energy use per person is relatively high in Malaysia compared to other upper-middle-income countries such as Brazil, Turkey or China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy use (kg of oil equivalent per capita)|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.PCAP.KG.OE|website=World Bank|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the transport sector consumed 23,425 kilotonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe), meaning that it was responsible for 45.2% of total energy consumed in Malaysia. It was followed by the industrial sector, which consumed 13,989 ktoe (27.0% of total energy demand); the residential and commercial sectors at 7,559 ktoe (14.6% of total energy demand); non-energy uses such as the manufacture of chemicals at 5,928 ktoe (11.4%) and agriculture accounting for the rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Energy Balance|publisher=Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission)|accessdate=9 April 2018|ref=http://meih.st.gov.my/documents/10620/233145b9-0df3-4aa4-8fff-acd483ea5701}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The Malaysian Energy Commission has set up various energy efficiency programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Energy Efficiency  | url=http://www.st.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4409&amp;Itemid=1238 | work=Suruhanjaya Tenaga| publisher= | date=6 May 2009 | accessdate=25 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local governments are also showing leadership on energy efficiency policies: Putrajaya has the aspiration of becoming a "Green City" by 2025,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toward Putrajaya Green City 2025|url=http://www.ppj.gov.my/cpnavigation/general/Towards_Putrajaya_Green_City_2025_Inventory_of_Putrajaya_GHG_Emissions_2012.pdf|publisher=Putrajaya Corporation|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Iskandar Malaysia has developed a "Low-Carbon Society Blueprint".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Low-Carbon Society Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia 2025|url=https://www.nies.go.jp/unfccc_cop/2014/4.3.pdf|publisher=https://www.nies.go.jp/unfccc_cop/2014/4.3.pdf|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are significant opportunities to improve energy efficiency in urban areas, where 73% of Malaysia's population live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban population (% of total).|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS|website=World Bank|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 90% of Malaysia's economic activity is conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muller|first1=S|title=Urbanization, infrastructure and economic growth in Southeast Asia|journal=Institute for Sustainable Communities|date=2013|url=http://www.iscvt.org/news/urbanization-infrastructure-and-economic-growth-in-asia/|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johor Bahru, for example, could reduce its emissions by a quarter by 2025 through a range of cost-effective investments: switching from diesel to natural gas in the rubber and petrochemical industries, promoting hybrid cars, adopting more ambitious green building standards and introducing mandatory energy performance standards for appliances such as air conditioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Colenbrander|first1=Sarah|title=Exploring the economic case for early investment in climate change mitigation in middle-income countries: a case study of Johor Bahru, Malaysia|journal=Climate and Development|date=2 June 2015|volume=8|issue=4|page=351-364|doi=10.1080/17565529.2015.1040367|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17565529.2015.1040367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suruhanjaya Tenaga (the Energy Commission) already have some of these measures in place.

'''Engineering and Public Policy''', informally known as '''EPP''', is an interdisciplinary academic department within the [[Carnegie Mellon College of Engineering]]. EPP combines technical analysis with [[social sciences|social science]] and [[policy analysis]], in order to address problems in which knowledge of technical details is critical to [[decision making]]. EPP is one of [https://web.archive.org/web/20131003052912/https://www.aaas.org/spp/sepp/sepslpc.shtml three departments] in [[United States]] universities that pioneered [[academic degree]] programs to address the profound societal changes brought about by [[technology]].

== History ==
What is now known as EPP began in 1971 as Engineering and Public Affairs (EP&amp;A), an [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] double major program jointly developed by the College of Engineering and the School of Urban and Public Affairs (now the [[Heinz College]]).  [[Washington University in St. Louis]] began offering a [[Master's degree|master's]] in Technology and Human Affairs in 1971, which was discontinued in 1993. In 1976, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Engineering|School of Engineering]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) began offering a master's degree through its Technology and Policy Program. Of the several academic programs now offered in technology and public policy, EPP and the Engineering Systems Division in MIT's School of Engineering are the most similar.

The primary purpose of the E&amp;PA program was to train undergraduate engineering students to work at the interface of the social and engineering sciences, through use of an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] curriculum based equally on [[Social theory|social analysis]] and [[engineering analysis]]. Students received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from one of the traditional engineering departments plus E&amp;PA.

Planning for the program began in the spring of 1969, initiated by the late [[Everard Mott Williams|Everard M. Williams]], head of the Department of [[Electrical Engineering]]. Early development and implementation of the undergraduate program began in 1970, led by faculty members Herbert Toor (then head of [[Chemical Engineering]] and later dean of Engineering), Robert Dunlap and Gordon Lewis. Dunlap and Gordon Lewis co-directed the program, which was announced in April 1971. The [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] provided support between 1971 and 1975.

In 1976 the College of Engineering advanced the program to departmental status, and changed its name to Engineering and Public Policy. The establishment of EPP was the first new accredited engineering department at Carnegie Mellon in nearly 75 years. 
 
M. Granger Morgan, who was recruited in 1974 to a joint appointment with the Department of Electrical Engineering, was appointed head of the new EPP department in 1977, and was given responsibility to coordinate the development of an EPP graduate program. Morgan stepped down as department head in 2014, and continues both his research and teaching responsibilities at CMU.  Douglas C. Sicker, a professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder, was appointed head of EPP in August 2014.

== Education ==

The department runs highly regarded undergraduate and graduate programs.  The undergraduate level includes a double major degree program which grants a joint degree between EPP and any of the five traditional engineering departments (Chemical, [[Civil engineering|Civil]], Electrical and [[Computer engineering|Computer]], [[Mechanical engineering|Mechanical]], and [[Materials Science]]) or the [[Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science|School of Computer Science]] (SCS).

EPP offers a minor in Technology and Policy (T&amp;P) for students not in Engineering or SCS. The department also offers a 5th-year master's degree for students who complete an EPP major or T&amp;P minor, as well as a master's program in Engineering &amp; Technology Innovation Management (ETIM).

The graduate program in Engineering and Public Policy educates technically skilled men and women at the doctoral level to be leaders in policy-focused research in which a deep understanding of technology is relevant to decision-making. As part of the Ph.D., students take additional courses in engineering and science, [[Quantitative research|quantitative methods]], social sciences and policy analysis.

== Faculty ==

The department has approximately 40 faculty, including 50-50 joint appointments with all five traditional engineering departments and several social science units. Jointly appointed EPP faculty regularly involve more traditional disciplinary colleagues in research collaborations.

Based on distinguished and continuing achievements, several EPP faculty have been elected to the [[United States National Academies]], including M. Granger Morgan, [[National Academy of Science]]; [[Baruch Fischhoff]] and Lester Lave, [[Institute of Medicine]]; and [[Alfred Blumstein]], Herbert Toor (emeritus) and Robert White (emeritus), [[National Academy of Engineering]].

EPP's faculty are widely published, frequently serve on government committees and provide expert testimony to lawmakers and regulators on an array of topics, from energy and the environment to consumer safety. In 2010, EPP professor Jon Peha was on sabbatical serving as Chief Technologist at the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. EPP professor [[David J. Farber|David Farber]] also served as FCC Chief Technologist from January 2000 to June 2001.

== Research ==

EPP works in four major research areas on problems that involve the interaction of technology with society:

# Energy and environment (including [[Climatology|climate]]);
# [[Risk analysis (engineering)|Risk analysis]] and [[Risk management|communication]];
# [[Information and communication technology]] policy;
# [[Technology Management|Management of technical innovation]] and [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] policy.

Across these four focal areas, the department addresses issues in technology and organizations, and in technology and [[economic development]], focusing in particular on [[India]] and [[China]]. EPP also develops new software tools for the support of policy analysis and research, and studies issues in engineered systems and [[Computer security|security]].

EPP has spearheaded a dozen large collaborative research efforts, including the [[National Science Foundation]]'s Climate and Energy Decision Making Center; Climate Decision Making Center; Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center; Green Design Institute; Center for the Study &amp; Improvement of Regulation; Center for Integrated Study of the Human Dimensions of Global Change; Integrated Environmental Control Model technology development; CCSReg Project,  to develop regulation for [[Carbon capture and storage|carbon capture and sequestration]] (CCS); RenewElec,  which addresses the problems of integrating variable and intermittent renewable generation into the electric power system; and Cylab Usable Privacy and Security Laboratory.

== Washington, D.C. office ==
In June 1997, EPP opened an office in [[Washington, D.C.]] to expand interaction between EPP students and faculty and relevant policy organizations in Washington. It serves as a base of operations for EPP participation in the policymaking processes of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], federal agencies, and other Washington institutions.

'''Geochemistry''' is the [[science]] that uses the tools and principles of [[chemistry]] to explain the mechanisms behind major geological systems such as the [[Earth's crust]] and its [[ocean]]s.&lt;ref name=Albarede/&gt;{{rp|1}} The realm of geochemistry extends beyond the [[Earth]], encompassing the entire [[Solar System]],&lt;ref name=cosmo/&gt; and has made important contributions to the understanding of a number of processes including [[mantle convection]], the formation of [[planet]]s and the origins of [[granite]] and [[basalt]].&lt;ref name=Albarede/&gt;{{rp|1}}

==History==
[[File:Victorgoldschmidt0006MA8633570-0001.jpg|thumb|[[Victor Goldschmidt]] (1909)]]
The term ''geochemistry'' was first used by the Swiss-German chemist [[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] in 1838: "a comparative geochemistry ought to be launched, before geochemistry can become geology, and before the mystery of the genesis of our planets and their inorganic matter may be revealed."&lt;ref name=Buildingbridges&gt;{{cite book |first=Helge|last=Kragh|chapter=From geochemistry to cosmochemistry: The origin of a scientific discipline, 1915–1955 |title= Chemical Sciences in the 20th Century: Bridging Boundaries|editor-last= Reinhardt|editor-first= Carsten|authorlink= |date= 2008|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|location= |isbn= 3-527-30271-9|pages= 160–192 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gIOK5EUm5ysC|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the rest of the century the more common term was "chemical geology", and there was little contact between [[geologist]]s and [[chemist]]s.&lt;ref name=Buildingbridges/&gt; 

Geochemistry emerged as a separate discipline after major laboratories were established, starting with the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) in 1884, and began systematic surveys of the chemistry of rocks and minerals. The chief USGS chemist, [[Frank Wigglesworth Clarke]], noted that the elements generally decrease in abundance as their atomic weights increase, and summarized the work on elemental abundance in ''The Data of Geochemistry''.&lt;ref name=Buildingbridges/&gt;&lt;ref name=McSween&gt;{{cite book|last1=McSween, Jr.|first1=Harry Y.|last2=Richardson|first2=Steven M.|last3=Uhle|first3=Maria E.|title=Geochemistry pathways and processes|date=2003|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York|isbn=9780231509039|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

The composition of [[meteorites]] was investigated and compared to terrestrial rocks as early as 1850. In 1901, [[Oliver C. Farrington]] hypothesised that, although there were differences, the relative abundances should still be the same.&lt;ref name=Buildingbridges/&gt;  This was the beginnings of the field of [[cosmochemistry]] and has contributed much of what we know about the formation of the Earth and the Solar System.&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;{{cite book |title= Geochemistry (Unpublished)|last= White|first= William M.|authorlink= |date= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= 1|pages= |url= http://www.geo.cornell.edu/geology/classes/geo455/Chapters.HTML|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Max von Laue]] and [[William L. Bragg]] showed that X-ray scattering could be used to determine the structures of crystals. In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Victor Goldschmidt]] and associates at the [[University of Oslo]] applied these methods to many common minerals and formulated a set of rules for how elements are grouped. Goldschmidt published this work in the series  ''Geochemische Verteilungsgesetze der Elemente'' [Geochemical Laws of the Distribution of Elements]''.&lt;ref name=McSween/&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Brian|title=Victor Moritz Goldschmidt : father of modern geochemistry|date=1992|publisher=Geochemical Society|location=San Antonio, Tex.|isbn=0-941809-03-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical elements==
The building blocks of materials are the [[chemical element]]s. These can be identified by their [[atomic number]] Z, which is the number of [[proton]]s in the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. An element can have more than one value for N, the [[neutron number|number of neutrons]] in the nucleus. The sum of these is the [[mass number]], which is roughly equal to the [[atomic mass]]. Atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers are called [[isotope]]s. A given isotope is identified by a letter for the element preceded by a superscript for the mass number. For example, two common isotopes of [[chlorine]] are &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl and &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Cl. There are about 1700 known combinations of Z and N, of which only about 260 are stable. However, most of the unstable isotopes do not occur in nature. In geochemistry, stable isotopes are used to trace chemical pathways and reactions, while isotopes are primarily used to date samples.&lt;ref name=McSween/&gt;{{rp|13–17}}

The chemical behavior of an atom – its [[Chemical affinity|affinity for other elements]] and the type of [[chemical bond|bonds]] it forms – is determined by the arrangement of electrons in [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]], particularly the outermost ([[valence electron|valence]]) electrons. These arrangements are reflected in the position of elements in the [[periodic table]].&lt;ref name=McSween/&gt;{{rp|13–17}} Based on position, the elements fall into the broad groups of [[alkali metal]]s, [[alkaline earth metal]]s, [[transition metal]]s, semi-metals (also known as [[metalloid]]s), [[halogen]]s, [[noble gas]]es, [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s.&lt;ref name=McSween/&gt;{{rp|20–23}}

Another useful classification scheme for geochemistry is the [[Goldschmidt classification]], which places the elements into four main groups. ''Lithophiles'' combine easily with oxygen. These elements, which include [[sodium|Na]], [[potassium|K]], [[silicon|Si]], [[aluminum|Al]], [[titanium|Ti]], [[magnesium|Mg]] and [[calcium|Ca]], dominate in the [[Earth's crust]], forming [[silicate]]s and other oxides. ''Siderophile'' elements ([[iron|Fe]], [[cobalt|Co]], [[nickel|Ni]], [[platinum|Pt]], [[rhenium|Re]], [[osmium|Os]]) have an affinity for [[iron]] and tend to concentrate in the [[Earth's core|core]]. ''Chalcophile'' elements ([[copper|Cu]], [[silver|Ag]], [[zinc|Zn]], [[lead|Pb]], [[sulfur|S]]) form [[sulfide]]s; and ''atmophile'' elements ([[oxygen|O]], [[nitrogen|N]], [[hydrogen|H]] and noble gases) dominate the atmosphere. Within each group, some elements are [[refractory]], remaining stable at high temperatures, while others are [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]], evaporating more easily, so heating can separate them.&lt;ref name=Albarede&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albarède|first1=Francis|title=Geochemistry : an introduction|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521891486|edition=5th|others=Translated from the French.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}}&lt;ref name=McSween/&gt;{{rp|23}}

==Differentiation and mixing==
The chemical composition of the Earth and other bodies is determined by two opposing processes: differentiation and mixing. In the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], differentiation occurs at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s through [[partial melting]], with more refractory materials remaining at the base of the [[lithosphere]] while the remainder rises to form [[basalt]]. After an oceanic plate descends into the mantle, [[convection]] eventually mixes the two parts together. [[Erosion]] differentiates [[granite]], separating it into [[clay]] on the ocean floor, [[sandstone]] on the edge of the continent, and dissolved minerals in ocean waters. [[Metamorphism]] and [[anatexis]] (partial melting of crustal rocks) can mix these elements together again. In the ocean, biological organisms can cause chemical differentiation, while dissolution of the organisms and their wastes can mix the materials again.&lt;ref name=Albarede/&gt;{{rp|23&amp;ndash;24}}

===Fractionation===
{{See also|magmatic differentiation}}
A major source of differentiation is [[fractionation]], an unequal distribution of elements and isotopes. This can be the result of chemical reactions, [[Phase transition|phase changes]], kinetic effects, or [[radioactivity]].&lt;ref name=Albarede/&gt;{{rp|2&amp;ndash;3}}
On the largest scale, ''[[planetary differentiation]]'' is a physical and chemical separation of a planet into chemically distinct regions. For example, the terrestrial planets formed iron-rich cores and silicate-rich mantles and crusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McSween, Jr.|first1=Harry Y.|last2=Huss|first2=Gary R.|title=Cosmochemistry|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139489461}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|218}} In the Earth's mantle, the primary source of chemical differentiation is [[partial melting]], particularly near mid-ocean ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olson|first1=Gerald Schubert ; Donald L. Turcotte ; Peter|title=Mantle convection in the earth and planets|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521798365}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68,153}} This can occur when the solid is heterogeneous or a [[solid solution]], and part of the melt is separated from the solid. The process is known as ''equilibrium'' or ''batch'' melting if the solid and melt remain in equilibrium until the moment that the melt is removed, and ''fractional'' or ''Rayleigh'' melting if is removed continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Marjorie|title=Igneous petrogenesis|date=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9789401093880}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Isotopic fractionation]] can have mass-dependent and mass-independent forms. Molecules with heavier isotopes have lower [[Zero-point energy|ground state energies]] and are therefore more stable. As a result, chemical reactions show a small isotope dependence, with heavier isotopes preferring species or compounds with a higher oxidation state; and in phase changes, heavier isotopes tend to concentrate in the heavier phases.&lt;ref name=Kendall&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kendall|first1=Carol|last2=Caldwell|first2=Eric A.|chapter=Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Isotope Geochemistry|editor-last1=Kendall|editor-first1=Carol|editor-last2=McDonnell|editor-first2=J. J.|title=Isotope tracers in catchment hydrology|date=2000|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780444501554|pages=51&amp;ndash;86|chapter-url=http://wwwrcamnl.wr.usgs.gov/isoig/isopubs/itchch2.html|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass-dependent fractionation is largest in light elements because the difference in masses is a larger fraction of the total mass.&lt;ref name=Hoefs&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoefs|first1=Jochen|title=Isotope fractionation processes of selected elements|journal=Stable Isotope Geochemistry|date=2015|pages=47&amp;ndash;134|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-19716-6_2|isbn=978-3-319-19715-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}}

Ratios between isotopes are generally compared to a standard. For example, sulfur has four stable isotopes, of which the two most common are &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S and &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S.&lt;ref name=Hoefs/&gt;{{rp|98}} The ratio of their concentrations, {{math|''R''{{=}}&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S/&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S}}, is reported as
:&lt;math&gt;\delta{}^{34}\mathrm{S} = 1000\left(\frac{R}{R_\mathrm{s}}-1\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the same ratio for a standard. Because the differences are small, the ratio is multiplied by 1000 to make it parts per thousand (referred to as parts per mil). This is represented by the symbol {{math|&amp;#8240;}}.&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt;{{rp|55}}

====Equilibrium====
''[[Equilibrium fractionation]]'' occurs between chemicals or phases that are in equilibrium with each other. In equilibrium fractionation between phases, heavier phases prefer the heavier isotopes. For two phases A and B, the effect can be represented by the factor
:&lt;math&gt; a_\mathrm{A-B} = \frac{R_\mathrm{A}}{R_\mathrm{B}}. &lt;/math&gt;
In the liquid-vapor phase transition for water, {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;l-v&lt;/sub&gt;}} at 20 degrees [[Celsius]] is 1.0098 for &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and 1.084 for &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H. In general, fractionation is greater at lower temperatures. At 0&amp;nbsp;°C, the factors are 1.0117 and 1.111.&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt;{{rp|59}}

====Kinetic====
When there is not equilibrium between phases or chemical compounds, ''[[kinetic fractionation]]'' can occur. For example, at interfaces between liquid water and air, the forward reaction is enhanced if the humidity of the air is less than 100% or the water vapor is moved by a wind. Kinetic fractionation generally is enhanced compared to equilibrium fractionation, and depends on factors such as reaction rate, reaction pathway and bond energy. Since lighter isotopes generally have weaker bonds, they tend to react faster and enrich the reaction products.&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt;{{rp|60}}

Biological fractionation is a form of kinetic fractionation, since reactions tend to be in one direction. Biological organisms prefer lighter isotopes because there is a lower energy cost in breaking energy bonds. In addition to the previously mentioned factors, the environment and species of the organism can have a large effect on the fractionation.&lt;ref name=Kendall/&gt;{{rp|70}}

== Cycles ==
{{Main|Geochemical cycle}}
{{See also|Climate model#Box models}}
Through a variety of physical and chemical processes, chemical elements change in concentration and move around in what are called ''geochemical cycles''. An understanding of these changes requires both detailed observation and theoretical models. Each chemical compound, element or isotope has a concentration that is a function {{math|''C''('''r''',''t'')}} of position and time, but it is impractical to model the full variability. Instead, in an approach borrowed from [[chemical engineering]],&lt;ref name=Albarede/&gt;{{rp|81}} geochemists average the concentration over regions of the earth called ''geochemical reservoirs''. The choice of reservoir depends on the problem; for example, the ocean may be a single reservoir or be split into multiple reservoirs.&lt;ref name=Lasaga&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lasaga|first1=Antonio C.|last2=Berner|first2=Robert A.|title=Fundamental aspects of quantitative models for geochemical cycles|journal=Chemical Geology|date=April 1998|volume=145|issue=3-4|pages=161–175|doi=10.1016/S0009-2541(97)00142-3|bibcode=1998ChGeo.145..161L}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a type of model called a ''box model'', a reservoir is represented by a box with inputs and outputs.&lt;ref name=Albarede/&gt;{{rp|81}}&lt;ref name=Lasaga/&gt;

Geochemical models generally involve feedback. In the simplest case of a linear cycle, either the input or the output from a reservoir is proportional to the concentration. For example, [[salt]] is removed from the ocean by formation of [[evaporite]]s, and given a constant rate of evaporation in evaporite basins, the rate of removal of salt should be proportional to its concentration. For a given component {{math|''C''}}, if the input to a reservoir is a constant {{math|''a''}} and the output is {{math|''kC''}} for some constant {{math|''k''}}, then the ''[[mass balance]]'' equation is
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d C}{d t} = a - kC.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
This expresses the fact that any change in mass must be balanced by changes in the input or output.  On a time scale of {{math|''t'' {{=}} 1/k}}, the system approaches a [[steady state]] in which {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;steady&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''a''/''k''}}. The ''[[residence time]]'' is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{res} = C^\text{steady}/I = C^\text{steady}/O,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''I''}} and {{math|''O''}} are the input and output rates. In the above example, the steady-state input and output rates are both equal to {{math|''a''}}, so {{math|&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;res&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1/''k''}}.&lt;ref name=Lasaga/&gt;

If the input and output rates are nonlinear functions of {{math|''C''}}, they may still be closely balanced over time scales much greater than the residence time; otherwise there will be large fluctuations in {{math|''C''}}. In that case, the system is always close to a steady state and a lowest order expansion of the mass balance equation will lead to a linear equation like Equation ({{EquationNote|1}}). In most systems, one or both of the input and output depend on {{math|''C''}}, resulting in a feedback that tends to maintain the steady state. If an external forcing perturbs the system, it will return to the steady state on a time scale of {{math|1/''k''}}.&lt;ref name=Lasaga/&gt;

The pattern of elemental abundance is mainly due to two factors. The hydrogen, helium, and some of the lithium were [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|formed in about 20 minutes after the Big Bang]], while the rest were [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|created in the interiors of stars]].&lt;ref name=McSween/&gt;{{rp|316&amp;ndash;317}}

===Meteorites===
[[Meteorite]]s come in a variety of compositions, but chemical analysis can determine whether they were once in [[planetesimal]]s that [[melting|melted]] or [[Planetary differentiation|differentiated]].&lt;ref name=Palme/&gt;{{rp|45}} [[Chondrite]]s are undifferentiated and have round mineral inclusions called [[chondrule]]s. With ages of 4.56 billion years, they date to the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|early solar system]]. A particular kind, the [[CI chondrite]], has a composition that closely matches that of the Sun's photosphere, except for depletion of some volatiles (H, He, C, N, O) and a group of elements (Li, B, Be) that are destroyed by nucleosynthesis in the Sun.&lt;ref name=McSween/&gt;{{rp|318}}&lt;ref name=Palme/&gt; Because of the latter group, CI chondrites are considered a better match for the composition of the early Solar System. Moreover, the chemical analysis of CI chondrites is more accurate than for the photosphere, so it is generally used as the source for chemical abundance, despite their rareness (only five have been recovered on Earth).&lt;ref name=Palme/&gt;

===Giant planets===
[[File:Gas Giant Interiors.jpg||thumb|upright=2|Cutaways illustrating models of the interiors of the giant planets.]]
The planets of the Solar System are divided into two groups: the four inner planets are the [[terrestrial planet]]s ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]] and [[Mars]]), with relatively small sizes and rocky surfaces. The four outer planets are the [[giant planets]], which are dominated by hydrogen and helium and have lower mean densities. These can be further subdivided into the [[gas giant]]s ([[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]) and the [[ice giant]]s ([[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]) that have large icy cores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Encrenaz|first1=Therese|last2=Bibring|first2=Jean-Pierre|last3=Blanc|first3=M.|last4=Barucci|first4=Maria-Antonietta|last5=Roques|first5=Francoise|last6=Zarka|first6=Philippe|title=The solar system|date=2004|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540002413|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26&amp;ndash;27,283&amp;ndash;284}}

Most of our direct information on the composition of the giant planets is from [[spectroscopy]]. Since the 1930s, Jupiter was known to contain hydrogen, [[methane]] and [[ammonium]]. In the 1960s, [[interferometry]] greatly increased the resolution and sensitivity of spectral analysis, allowing the identification of a much greater collection of molecules including [[ethane]], [[acetylene]], water and [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=John|title=Physics and Chemistry of the Solar System|date=1995|publisher=Elsevier Science|location=Burlington|isbn=9780323145848}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|138&amp;ndash;139}} However, Earth-based spectroscopy becomes increasingly difficult with more remote planets, since the reflected light of the Sun is much dimmer; and spectroscopic analysis of light from the planets can only be used to detect vibrations of molecules, which are in the [[infrared]] frequency range. This constrains the abundances of the elements H, C and N.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;{{rp|130}} Two other elements are detected: phosphorus in the gas [[phosphine]] (PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and germanium in [[germane]] (GeH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;{{rp|131}} 

The helium atom has vibrations in the [[ultraviolet]] range, which is strongly absorbed by the atmospheres of the outer planets and Earth. Thus, despite its abundance, helium was only detected once spacecraft were sent to the outer planets, and then only indirectly through collision-induced absortion in hydrogen molecules.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;{{rp|209}} Further information on Jupiter was obtained from the [[Galileo Probe|''Galileo'' probe]] when it was sent into the atmosphere in 1995;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atreya|first1=S.K|last2=Mahaffy|first2=P.R|last3=Niemann|first3=H.B|last4=Wong|first4=M.H|last5=Owen|first5=T.C|title=Composition and origin of the atmosphere of Jupiter—an update, and implications for the extrasolar giant planets|journal=Planetary and Space Science|date=February 2003|volume=51|issue=2|pages=105–112|doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(02)00144-7|bibcode=2003P&amp;SS...51..105A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fortney&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fortney|first1=Jonathan|title=Viewpoint: Peering into Jupiter|url=https://physics.aps.org/articles/v3/26|accessdate=10 October 2017|work=Physics|volume=3|page=26|date=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cassini retirement|final mission]] of the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini probe]] in 2017 was to enter the atmosphere of Saturn.&lt;ref name="Bittersweet ending"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-cassini-ends-scene-20170915-story.html |title=As NASA’s Cassini mission flames out over Saturn, scientists mark bittersweet end of mission |last=Netburn|first=Deborah |date=15 September 2017 |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |access-date=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the atmosphere of Jupiter, He was found to be depleted by a factor of 2 compared to solar composition and Ne by a factor of 10, a surprising result since the other noble gases and the elements C, N and S were enhanced by factors of 2 to 4 (oxygen was also depleted but this was attributed to the unusually dry region that Galileo sampled).&lt;ref name=Fortney/&gt;

Spectroscopic methods only penetrate the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn to depths where the pressure is about equal to 1 [[bar (unit)|bar]], approximately Earth's [[atmospheric pressure]] at [[sea level]].&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;{{rp|131}} The Galileo probe penetrated to 22 bars.&lt;ref name=Fortney/&gt; This is a small fraction of the planet, which is expected to reach pressures of over 40 Mbar. To constrain the composition in the interior, thermodynamic models are constructed using information on temperature from infrared emission spectra and equations of state for the likely compositions.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;{{rp|131}} High pressure experiments predict that hydrogen will be a metallic liquid in the interior of Jupiter and Saturn, while in Uranus and Neptune it remains in the molecular state.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;{{rp|135&amp;ndash;136}} Estimates also depend on models for the formation of the planets. Condensation of the presolar nebula would result in a gaseous planet with the same composition as the Sun, but the planets could also have formed when a solid core captured nebular gas.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;{{rp|136}}

In current models, the four giant planets have cores of rock and ice that are roughly the same size, but the proportion of hydrogen and helium decreases from about 300 Earth masses in Jupiter to 75 in Saturn and just a few in Uranus and Neptune.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;{{rp|220}} Thus, while the gas giants are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, the ice giants are primarily composed of heavier elements (O, C, N, S), primarily in the form of water, methane and ammonia. The surfaces are cold enough for molecular hydrogen to be liquid, so much of each planet is likely a hydrogen ocean overlaying one of heavier compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=11. Uranus and Neptune |last1=Lang|first1=Kenneth R.|title=NASA's Cosmos|date=2010|publisher=Tufts University|url=https://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/print_chapter.asp?id=11|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the core, Jupiter has a mantle of liquid metallic hydrogen and an atmosphere of molecular hydrogen and helium. Metallic hydrogen does not mix well with helium, and in Saturn it may form a separate layer below the metallic hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;{{rp|138}}

===Terrestrial planets===
{{See also|Composition of Mars}}
Terrestrial planets are believed to have come from the same nebular material as the giant planets, but they have lost most of the lighter elements and have different histories. Planets closer to the Sun might be expected to have a higher fraction of refractory elements, but if their later stages of formation involved collisions of large objects with orbits that sampled different parts of the Solar System, there could be little systematic dependence on position.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Don L.|title=New Theory of the Earth|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139462082}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3&amp;ndash;4}}

Direct information on Mars, Venus and Mercury largely comes from spacecraft missions. Using [[gamma-ray spectrometer]]s, the composition of the crust of Mars has been measured by the [[Mars Odyssey]] orbiter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GRS|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/odyssey/mission/instruments/grs/|website=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|publisher=USA.gov|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the crust of Venus by some of the [[Venera]] missions to Venus,&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; and the crust of Mercury by the ''[[MESSENGER]]'' spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhodes|first1=Edgar A.|last2=Evans|first2=Larry G.|last3=Nittler|first3=Larry R.|last4=Starr|first4=Richard D.|last5=Sprague|first5=Ann L.|last6=Lawrence|first6=David J.|last7=McCoy|first7=Timothy J.|last8=Stockstill-Cahill|first8=Karen R.|last9=Goldsten|first9=John O.|last10=Peplowski|first10=Patrick N.|last11=Hamara|first11=David K.|last12=Boynton|first12=William V.|last13=Solomon|first13=Sean C.|title=Analysis of MESSENGER Gamma-Ray Spectrometer data from the Mercury flybys|journal=Planetary and Space Science|date=December 2011|volume=59|issue=15|pages=1829–1841|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2011.07.018|bibcode=2011P&amp;SS...59.1829R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional information on Mars comes from meteorites that have landed on Earth (the [[Shergottite]]s, [[Nakhlite]]s, and [[Chassignite]]s, collectively known as SNC meteorites).&lt;ref name=Kieffer&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Kieffer|editor-first1=Hugh H.|title=Mars|date=1994|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=9780816512577|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|124}} Abundances are also constrained by the masses of the planets, while the internal distribution of elements is constrained by their moments of inertia.&lt;ref name=McSween/&gt;{{rp|334}}

The planets condensed from the solar nebula, and much of the details of their composition are determined by fractionation as they cooled. The phases that condense fall into five groups. First to condense are materials rich in refractory elements such as Ca and Al. These are followed by nickel and iron, then [[Talc|magnesium silicates]]. Below about 700 [[kelvin]]s (700 K), [[Iron(II) sulfide|FeS]] and volatile-rich metals and silicates form a fourth group, and in the fifth group [[Iron(II) oxide|FeO]] enter the magnesium silicates.&lt;ref name=Morgan1980&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morgan|first1=John W.|last2=Anders|first2=Edward|title=Chemical composition of Earth, Venus, and Mercury|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=December 1980|volume=77|issue=12|pages=6973&amp;ndash6977|jstor=9538|bibcode=1980PNAS...77.6973M|doi=10.1073/pnas.77.12.6973|pmc=350422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compositions of the planets and the Moon are ''chondritic'', meaning that within each group the ratios between elements are the same as in carbonaceous chondrites.&lt;ref name=McSween/&gt;{{rp|334}}

The estimates of planetary compositions depend on the model used. In the ''equilibrium condensation'' model, each planet was formed from a ''feeding zone'' in which the compositions of solids were determined by the temperature in that zone. Thus, Mercury formed at 1400 K, where iron remained in a pure metallic form and there was little magnesium or silicon in solid form; Venus at 900 K, so all the magnesium and silicon condensed; Earth at 600 K, so it contains FeS and silicates; and Mars at 450 K, so FeO was incorporated into magnesium silicates. The greatest problem with this theory is that volatiles would not condense, so the planets would have no atmospheres and Earth no atmosphere.&lt;ref name=McSween/&gt;{{rp|335&amp;ndash;336}}

In ''chondritic mixing'' models, the compositions of chondrites are used to estimate planetary compositions. For example, one model mixes two components, one with the composition of C1 chondrites and one with just the refractory components of C1 chondrites.&lt;ref name=McSween/&gt;{{rp|337}} In another model, the abundances of the five fractionation groups are estimated using an index element for each group. For the most refractory group, [[uranium]] is used; iron for the second; the ratios of potassium and [[thalium]] to uranium for the next two; and the molar ratio FeO/(FeO+[[Magnesium oxide|MgO]]) for the last. Using thermal and seismic models along with heat flow and density, Fe can be constrained to within 10 percent on Earth, Venus and Mercury. U can be constrained within about 30% on Earth, but its abundance on other planets is based on "educated guesses". One difficulty with this model is that there may be significant errors in its prediction of volatile abundances because some volatiles are only partially condensed.&lt;ref name=Morgan1980&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morgan|first1=John W.|last2=Anders|first2=Edward|title=Chemical composition of Earth, Venus, and Mercury|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=December 1980|volume=77|issue=12|pages=6973&amp;ndash6977|jstor=9538|bibcode=1980PNAS...77.6973M|doi=10.1073/pnas.77.12.6973|pmc=350422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McSween/&gt;{{rp|337&amp;ndash;338}}

==Earth's crust==
The more common rock constituents are nearly all [[oxide]]s; [[chloride]]s, [[sulfide]]s and [[fluoride]]s are the only important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. [[Frank Wigglesworth Clarke|F. W. Clarke]] has calculated that a little more than 47% of the Earth's crust consists of [[oxygen]]. It occurs principally in combination as oxides, of which the chief are [[silica]], [[alumina]], [[iron oxide]]s, and various [[carbonate]]s ([[calcium carbonate]], [[magnesium carbonate]],  [[sodium carbonate]], and [[potassium carbonate]]). The silica functions principally as an acid, forming silicates, and all the commonest minerals of igneous rocks are of this nature. From a computation based on 1672 analyses of numerous kinds of rocks Clarke arrived at the following as the average percentage composition of the Earth's crust: SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=59.71, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=15.41, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=2.63, FeO=3.52, MgO=4.36, CaO=4.90, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=3.55, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=2.80, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O=1.52, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=0.60, P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;=0.22, (total 99.22%). All the other constituents occur only in very small quantities, usually much less than 1%.

These oxides  combine in a haphazard way. For example, [[potash]] (potassium carbonate) and soda ([[sodium carbonate]]) combine to produce [[feldspar]]s. In some cases they may take other forms, such as [[nepheline]], [[leucite]], and [[muscovite]], but in the great majority of instances they are found as feldspar. [[Phosphoric acid]] with [[Lime (material)|lime]] (calcium carbonate) forms [[apatite]]. [[Titanium dioxide]] with [[ferrous oxide]] gives rise to [[ilmenite]]. Part of the lime forms lime feldspar. Magnesium carbonate and iron oxides with silica crystallize as [[olivine]] or [[enstatite]], or with alumina and lime form the complex ferro-magnesian silicates of which the [[pyroxene]]s, [[amphibole]]s, and [[biotite]]s are the chief. Any excess of silica above what is required to neutralize the [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s will separate out as [[quartz]]; excess of alumina crystallizes as [[corundum]]. These must be regarded only as general tendencies. It is possible, by rock analysis, to say approximately what minerals the rock contains, but there are numerous exceptions to any rule.

===Mineral constitution===
Except in acid or siliceous igneous rocks containing greater than 66% of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], known as [[felsic]] rocks, quartz is not abundant in igneous rocks. In basic rocks (containing 20% of silica or less) it is rare  for them to contain as much silicon, these are referred to as [[mafic]] rocks. If [[magnesium]] and [[iron]] are above average while silica is low, [[olivine]] may be expected; where silica is present in greater quantity over ferro-magnesian minerals, such as [[augite]], [[hornblende]], [[enstatite]] or [[biotite]], occur rather than olivine. Unless [[potash]] is high and silica relatively low, [[leucite]] will not be present, for leucite does not occur with free quartz. [[Nepheline]], likewise, is usually found in rocks with much soda and comparatively little silica. With high [[Alkali metal|alkalis]], soda-bearing [[pyroxenes]] and [[amphiboles]] may be present. The lower the percentage of silica and alkali's, the greater is the prevalence of [[plagioclase|plagioclase feldspar]] as contracted with soda or potash feldspar.

Earth's crust is composed of 90% silicate minerals and their abundance in the Earth is as follows: [[plagioclase feldspar]] (39%), [[alkali feldspar]] (12%), quartz (12%), [[pyroxene]] (11%), [[amphiboles]] (5%), [[micas]] (5%), [[clay minerals]] (5%); the remaining silicate minerals make up another 3% of Earth's crust.  Only 8% of the Earth is composed of non-silicate minerals such as [[Carbonate minerals|carbonates]], [[Oxide minerals|oxides]], and [[Sulfide minerals|sulfides]].&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.sandatlas.org/minerals/], which cites this: Klein, C., Hurlbut, C. S. (1993) ''Manual of Mineralogy'', 21st Edition. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other determining factor, namely the physical conditions attending consolidation, plays on the whole a smaller part, yet is by no means negligible. Certain minerals are practically confined to deep-seated intrusive rocks, e.g., microcline, muscovite, diallage. Leucite is very rare in plutonic masses; many minerals have special peculiarities in microscopic character according to whether they crystallized in depth or near the surface, e.g., hypersthene, orthoclase, quartz. There are some curious instances of rocks having the same chemical composition, but consisting of entirely different minerals, e.g., the hornblendite of Gran, in Norway, which contains only hornblende, has the same composition as some of the camptonites of the same locality that contain feldspar and hornblende of a different variety. In this connection we may repeat what has been said above about the corrosion of porphyritic minerals in igneous rocks. In rhyolites and trachytes, early crystals of hornblende and biotite may be found in great numbers partially converted into augite and magnetite. Hornblende and biotite were stable under the pressures and other conditions below the surface, but unstable at higher levels. In the ground-mass of these rocks, augite is almost universally present. But the plutonic representatives of the same magma, granite and syenite contain biotite and hornblende far more commonly than augite.

===Felsic, intermediate and mafic igneous rocks===
Those rocks that contain the most silica, and on crystallizing yield free quartz, form a group generally designated the "felsic" rocks. Those again that contain least silica and most magnesia and iron, so that quartz is absent while [[olivine]] is usually abundant, form the "mafic" group. The "intermediate" rocks include those characterized by the general absence of both quartz and olivine. An important subdivision of these contains a very high percentage of alkalis, especially soda, and consequently has minerals such as [[nepheline]] and [[leucite]] not common in other rocks. It is often separated from the others as the "alkali" or "soda" rocks, and there is a corresponding series of mafic rocks. Lastly a small sub-group rich in olivine and without feldspar has been called the "ultramafic" rocks. They have very low percentages of silica but much iron and magnesia.

Except these last, practically all rocks contain felspars or feldspathoid minerals. In the acid rocks the common feldspars are orthoclase, perthite, microcline, and oligoclase—all having much silica and alkalis. In the mafic rocks labradorite, anorthite and bytownite prevail, being rich in lime and poor in silica, potash and soda. Augite is the most common ferro-magnesian in mafic rocks, but biotite and hornblende are on the whole more frequent in felsic rocks.

Rocks that contain leucite or nepheline, either partly or a wholly replacing felspar, are not included in this table. They are essentially of intermediate or of mafic character. We might in consequence regard them as varieties of syenite, diorite, gabbro, etc., in which feldspathoid minerals occur, and indeed there are many transitions between syenites of ordinary type and nepheline — or leucite — syenite, and between gabbro or dolerite and theralite or essexite. But, as many minerals develop in these "alkali" rocks that are uncommon elsewhere, it is convenient in a purely formal classification like that outlined here to treat the whole assemblage as a distinct series.

This classification is based essentially on the mineralogical constitution of the igneous rocks. Any chemical distinctions between the different groups, though implied, are relegated to a subordinate position. It is admittedly artificial but it has grown up with the growth of the science and is still adopted as the basis on which more minute subdivisions are erected. The subdivisions are by no means of equal value. The syenites, for example, and the peridotites, are far less important than the granites, diorites and gabbros. Moreover, the effusive andesites do not always correspond to the plutonic diorites but partly also to the gabbros. As the different kinds of rock, regarded as [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]]s of minerals, pass gradually into one another, transitional types are very common and are often so important as to receive special names. The quartz-syenites and nordmarkites may be interposed between granite and syenite, the tonalites and adamellites between granite and diorite, the monzoaites between syenite and diorite, norites and hyperites between diorite and gabbro, and so on.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1|volume=21|pages=323–333|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri21chisrich#page/323/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trace metals in the ocean==
[[Trace metal]]s readily form [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] with major [[ion]]s in the ocean, including [[hydroxide]], [[carbonate]], and [[chloride]] and their chemical speciation changes depending on whether the environment is [[redox|oxidized or reduced]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nameroff|first1=T|last2=Balistrieri|first2=L|last3=Murray|first3=J|title=Suboxic Trace Metal Geochemistry in the Eastern Tropic North Pacific|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=66|issue=7|pages=1139–1158|date=2002|doi=10.1016/s0016-7037(01)00843-2|bibcode=2002GeCoA..66.1139N}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Benjamin (2002) defines complexes of metals with more than one type of [[ligand]], other than water, as mixed-ligand-complexes. In some cases, a ligand contains more than one ''donor'' atom, forming very strong complexes, also called [[chelate]]s (the ligand is the chelator). One of the most common chelators is EDTA ([[ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]]), which can replace six molecules of water and form strong bonds with metals that have a plus two charge.&lt;ref name=Benjamin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benjamin|first1=M|title=Water Chemistry|date=2002|publisher=University of Washington|isbn=1-57766-667-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With stronger complexation, lower [[Thermodynamic activity|activity]] of the free metal ion is observed. One consequence of the lower reactivity of complexed metals compared to the same concentration of free metal is that the chelation tends to stabilize metals in the aqueous solution instead of in solids.&lt;ref name=Benjamin/&gt;
 
[[Chemical concentration|Concentrations]] of the trace metals [[cadmium]], [[copper]], [[molybdenum]], [[manganese]], [[rhenium]], [[uranium]] and [[vanadium]] in sediments record the redox history of the oceans. Within aquatic environments, cadmium(II) can either be in the form CdCl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; in oxic waters or CdS(s) in a reduced environment. Thus higher concentrations of Cd in marine sediments may indicate low redox potential conditions in the past. For copper(II), a prevalent form is CuCl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) within oxic environments and CuS(s) and Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S within reduced environments. The reduced seawater environment leads to two possible oxidation states of copper, Cu(I) and Cu(II). Molybdenum is present as the Mo(VI) oxidation state as MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; in oxic environments. Mo(V) and Mo(IV) are present in reduced environments in the forms MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2(s)&lt;/sub&gt;. Rhenium is present as the Re(VII) oxidation state as ReO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; within oxic conditions, but is reduced to Re(IV) which may form ReO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Uranium is in oxidation state VI in UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) and is found in the reduced form UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(s). Vanadium is in several forms in oxidation state V(V); HVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Its reduced forms can include VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, VO(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and V(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. These relative dominance of these species depends on [[pH]].

In the water column of the ocean or deep lakes, vertical profiles of dissolved trace metals are characterized as following ''conservative–type'', ''nutrient–type'', or ''scavenged–type'' distributions. Across these three distributions, trace metals have different residence times and are used to varying extents by [[plankton]]ic microorganisms. Trace metals with conservative-type distributions have high concentrations relative to their biological use. One example of a trace metal with a conservative-type distribution is molybdenum. It has a residence time within the oceans of around 8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; years and is generally present as the [[molybdate]] anion (MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;). Molybdenum interacts weakly with particles and displays an almost uniform vertical profile in the ocean. Relative to the abundance of molybdenum in the ocean, the amount required as a metal cofactor for [[enzyme]]s in marine [[phytoplankton]] is negligible.&lt;ref name=Bruland&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bruland |first1=K |last2=Lohan |first2=M |chapter= 6.02 &amp;ndash; Controls on Trace Metals in Seawater|editor-last1=Holland |editor-first1=H.D. |editor-last2= Turekian |editor-first2=K.K. |title= Treatise on Geochemistry |volume= Volume 6: The Oceans and Marine Geochemistry |date=2003 |pages=23–47 |doi= 10.1016/B0-08-043751-6/06105-3|bibcode=2003TrGeo...6...23B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trace metals with nutrient-type distributions are strongly associated with the internal cycles of particulate organic matter, especially the assimilation by plankton. The lowest dissolved concentrations of these metals are at the surface of the ocean, where they are assimilated by plankton. As dissolution and decomposition occur at greater depths, concentrations of these trace metals increase. Residence times of these metals, such as zinc, are several thousand to one hundred thousand years. Finally, an example of a scavenged-type trace metal is [[aluminium]], which has strong interactions with particles as well as a short residence time in the ocean. The residence times of scavenged-type trace metals are around 100 to 1000 years. The concentrations of these metals are highest around bottom sediments, [[hydrothermal vent]]s, and rivers. For aluminium, atmospheric dust provides the greatest source of external inputs into the ocean.&lt;ref name=Bruland/&gt;

Iron and copper show hybrid distributions in the ocean. They are influenced by recycling and intense scavenging. Iron is a limiting nutrient in vast areas of the oceans, and is found in high abundance along with manganese near hydrothermal vents. Here, many iron precipitates are found, mostly in the forms of iron sulfides and oxidized iron oxyhydroxide compounds. Concentrations of iron near hydrothermal vents can be up to one million times the concentrations found in the open ocean.&lt;ref name=Bruland/&gt;

Using electrochemical techniques, it is possible to show that bioactive trace metals (zinc, cobalt, cadmium, iron and copper) are bound by organic ligands in surface seawater. These ligand complexes serve to lower the bioavailability of trace metals within the ocean. For example, copper, which may be toxic to open ocean phytoplankton and bacteria, can form organic complexes. The formation of these complexes reduces the concentrations of bioavailable inorganic complexes of copper that could be toxic to sea life at high concentrations. Unlike copper, zinc toxicity in marine phytoplankton is low and there is no advantage to increasing the organic binding of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In high nutrient-low chlorophyll regions, iron is the limiting nutrient, with the dominant species being strong organic complexes of Fe(III).&lt;ref name=Bruland/&gt;

He produces and presents a weekly 30-minute program, ''World Of Radio'',&lt;ref name="League1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=American Radio Relay League|title=ARRL Operating Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ICivfre46-QC|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=August 1997|publisher=American Radio Relay League|isbn=978-0-87259-614-6|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; heard on a number of [[Public broadcasting|non-commercial]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations throughout the [[United States|U.S.]] and worldwide on [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]].

Hauser began his broadcasting career on [[Radio Canada International]] during the late 1970s, providing DX tips on Sunday nights, and his tips also appeared on [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide|Radio Nederland's]] ''DX Juke Box'' program. He wrote for ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' and ''[[Modern Electronics]]'', and published ''Review of International Broadcasting''.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, Sheldon, "[http://www.cidx.ca/sf/SF5Hauser.php Glenn Hauser interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706172348/http://www.cidx.ca/sf/SF5Hauser.php |date=2011-07-06 }}", ''CIDX Special Feature #5'', Summer 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==''World of Radio''==
''World Of Radio'' debuted in 1980 on [[WUOT]]-FM in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], moving to shortwave two years later. The half-hour program consists of Hauser reading news about radio around the world in a characteristic monotone. Although ''World of Radio'' focuses on shortwave news, it covers all aspects of broadcasting. Most items are contributed by listeners to the program or DX publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofradio.com/dxlatest.txt|title=DX Listening Digest|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mundo Radial''===
Hauser also produced ''Mundo Radial'', a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] edition of ''World of Radio'', from January 2002 to November 2007.&lt;ref name=Mundo&gt;[http://www.worldofradio.com/espanol.html Mundo Radial]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Review of International Broadcasting''==
Hauser introduced ''Review of International Broadcasting'' in February 1977.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; The magazine published 154 issues, with columns such as "Listener Insights on Programming," "Radio Equipment Forum," "DX Listening Digest," "The Media Mind" and "Satellite Watch."&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; Contributors included David Newkirk, Loren Cox and Juan Carlos Codina,&lt;ref name=Berg&gt;Berg, Jerome S., "Review of International Broadcasting (1977–1997)", 'Listening on the short waves, 1945 to today'', pg 221–223&lt;/ref&gt; and ''RIB'' also featured columns from the BBC, John Norfolk and Alan Roe.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; It was published monthly during the 1970s and 1980s, later decreasing to quarterly and semiannually before ceasing publication in October 1997.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; ''RIB''{{'}}s successor, ''DX Listening Digest'', went online in 1999.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt;

=={{anchor|Religious views}}Political and religious views==
Hauser is a political [[Liberalism|liberal]] and an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]],&lt;!-- Think he identifies as atheist. --&gt; which occasionally puts him at odds with the [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist-dominated]] [[Shortwave broadcasting in the United States|American shortwave scene]] which carries ''World of Radio''.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

Since the 1980s, self-styled '''Green Scouts''' have appeared in several countries, related to the [[Environmental movement|protection of the environment]] and in some cases linked to [[Worldwide green parties|Greens Parties]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eeiu.org/chapters/sevastopol/updates.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, specifically environmentally-minded Scouts have existed since the very earliest days of the movement.

==Background==
In response to a rash of devastating [[forest fire|fires]] in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the [[State of Michigan]] established a group of [[Boy Scout]]s called the ''Michigan Forest Scouts'' in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virtualscoutmuseum.com/Galleries/Other/other.html&lt;/ref&gt; A similar group, with nearly identical badges, was later established in the [[State of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virtualscoutmuseum.com/text.html&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these organizations was not [[Moral character|character]] building, as it was with the [[Boy Scouts of America]], and there were no ranks or [[Scout badge|merit badges]]. Instead, the Forest Scouts were charged with protecting the state's [[forest]]s, and as a result were considered [[:wikt:auxiliary|auxiliary]] [[fire wardens]]. Although the BSA typically disapproved of such groups, it was not so with the Forest Scouts. In one of the BSA's annual reports, the Forest Scouts are mentioned with approval and a note is made that "the groups are headed up by Boy Scout men and that the Forest Scouts and the Boy Scouts of America are closely affiliated."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Michigan_Forest_Scouts.html?id=uWNFfub9hQQC Michigan Forest Scouts: for the protection of frontier life and property and reforestation, J. H. McGillivray, William R. Oates, Michigan. State Game, Fish and Forest Fire Dept, 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama]] has had direct involvement with Green Scouting on at least two occasions, when on September 3, 1999 he was made a Patron of the [[Global Movement of Green Scouts]] in [[New Delhi, India]].&lt;ref&gt;https://tibet.net//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/souvenir.pdf p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

Scouting organizations in [[Niger]] include the [[Association Nigerienne des Scouts de l'Environnement]] (ANSEN), founded in 2003, which seems to have UN accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/africa/osaa/ngodirectory2/dest/countries/printNGO.asp?lang=ENG&amp;country=36&amp;ngo=NIG11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

The [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] has clearly stated its firm opposition to use of the words "Scout" and "Boy Scout" by Green Scout organizations, and made their position clear to all international [[government]]al and [[non-governmental organizations]] involved with the [[Natural environment|environment]], such as the [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations' Environment Program]] and the [[WWF (conservation organization)|World-Wide Fund for Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.tcu.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind9604&amp;L=scouts-l&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=10004 Listserv]&lt;/ref&gt;

:"There is room for all in the fight to protect nature and the environment,... but there is no room for creating confusion between that fight and the broader purposes of an established educational organization such as World Scouting and its duly authorized member associations around the globe." explained [[Jacques Moreillon]], Secretary General of WOSM in the 1990s.

Several national WOSM member organizations issue a [[World Conservation Award]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11447">The '''Japanese temperate rainforest''' is located in the [[Japanese archipelago]], in small patches over a wide range of islands, from [[Kyushu]] in the South to [[Hokkaido]] in the North. Due to its geographic features and climate, the Japanese temperate rainforest is very different from other [[temperate rainforests]] in the world. The islands in the Japanese archipelago comprise about 1/400 of the world’s land.&lt;ref name="s1"&gt;{{cite journal|last =Murata|first =Gen|title = Flora and vegetation zone of Japan|journal = The Japanese Society for Plant Systematics|volume=28|issue=1|year=2005|pages= 1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The islands are located on a latitude that is normally dry; desert can be found elsewhere in the world at this latitude. However, the oceans surrounding Japan provide enough precipitation to maintain a temperate rainforest.

==General description==
The Japanese temperate rainforest can be classified into three types: the warm temperate zone found in the southern islands and lower elevations in the north, the cool temperate zone found in the northern islands and higher elevations in the south, and the [[subalpine forest]] in the higher elevations of northern [[Honshu]] and Hokkaido.&lt;ref name="s1" /&gt; The distribution of the Japanese temperate rainforest is also highly dependent on altitude; you may see all of three types of temperate rainforest on the higher mountains such as [[Mt. Fuji]] or Mt. Miyanouradake.

==Climate==
The climate of this region is warm and wet. The mean annual temperature is 6 – 13&amp;nbsp;°C in the cool temperate zone and 13 – 23&amp;nbsp;°C in the warm temperate zone.&lt;ref name="s2" /&gt;  Annual precipitation is 1,200 – 1,800&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="s2"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some regions have an annual precipitation of more than 2,800&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="s2" /&gt; The precipitation pattern of cool and warm temperate zones is almost opposite: the southern warm temperate rainforest has higher precipitation in summer and less precipitation in winter, and the northern cool temperate rainforest has lower precipitation in summer and higher in winter with the snowfall. High precipitation is caused by [[Ocean circulation|oceanic circulation]] and the [[rain shadow effect]]. Summer [[typhoons]] from the [[tropics]] bring warm; moist air to the southern islands, especially on the [[Pacific Ocean]] side. [[Westerlies|Westerly]] from [[Siberian high]] and [[Tsushima Current]] cause heavy snowfall on the [[Sea of Japan]] side of northern Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/indexe.html|title = Weather, Climate &amp; Earthquake Information|publisher =[[Japan Meteorological Agency]]|accessdate = November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The Japanese temperate rainforest is home to about 5300 plant species, 40 percent of which are unique to Japan.&lt;ref name="s1" /&gt;  The Japanese archipelago was not influenced by the [[glacier]] extension in the last [[ice age]];&lt;ref name="s2" /&gt;  therefore, it provided [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] for many species. Also, there is no dry, [[desert]] area within the islands; thus, flora moved fluently between north and south after the last ice age.&lt;ref name="s1" /&gt;  In addition, the Japanese islands are isolated, reducing immigration of organisms from the Eurasian continent.

The subalpine (cold) temperate rainforests are dominated by [[tsuga]] and [[fir]].&lt;ref name="s1" /&gt;  Veitch’s fir (''[[Abies veitchii]]''), Maries’ fir (''[[Abies mariesii]]'') and northern Japanese hemlock are commonly seen. Also, Japanese cypress (''[[Chamaecyparis]]''), ''[[Thujopsis]]'' (also called hiba) can be found there.&lt;ref name="s6" /&gt; Other than those trees, broad-leaf trees such as Japanese beech (''[[Fagus crenata]]'') and [[oak]] are co-dominant canopy trees in this area. The understory is dominated by the bamboo ''[[Sasa veitchii]]'' in most lower elevation sites in western Hokkaido. [[Fern]]s, sedges (''[[Carex]]''), and shrubs are co-dominant understory species in this area.&lt;ref name="s6"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rinya.maff.go.jp/j/kikaku/hakusyo/23hakusyo_h/summary/s05.html|title=Annual Report on Trends in Forests and Forestry Summary 2008|work=Forest Agency Hokkaidou Regional Office|publisher=Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cool temperate rainforest is dominated by Japanese beech (''[[Fagus crenata]]''). Also, Marie's fir, (''Abies mariesii''), ''[[Pinus pumila]]'', [[oak]] (''[[Quercus crispula]]''), and [[Japanese cypress]] are commonly seen in the cool temperate zone. The understory is dominated by another bamboo species called Chisimazasa (''[[Sasa kurilensis]]''); willow and shrubs such as (''[[Camellia rusticana]]'') are also common in this zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Fauna==
Temperate rainforests, especially old-growth forests, provide quality habitat for many species, including [[natural monument]] animals or those on the [[IUCN Red List]]—species such as the [[black woodpecker]], [[Asian black bear|Japanese black bear]], [[Japanese dormouse]], [[Japanese giant salamander]], [[Japanese serow]], [[Japanese macaque]], [[Golden eagle|Japanese golden eagle]], [[sika deer]], [[Japanese grass lizard]], and [[Japanese rat snake]]. Larger mammals, such as sika deer and Japanese macaque, are commonly seen in all of the temperate zones, but most [[amphibians]] and small mammals are unique to each zone. Some species, such as the black woodpecker, live in only [[old-growth forests]] and the ongoing loss of their habitat is a serious problem for these species.&lt;ref name="s10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinki.env.go.jp/nature/odaigahara/odai_top.htm|title=Yoshino Kumano National Park of Japan|publisher=Ministry of Environment Kinki Regional Office|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/park/kirishima/ywhcc/np/np.htm|title=About the Yakushima National Park|work=The Yakushima World Heritage Center|publisher=Ministry of Environment|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tohoku.env.go.jp/nature/shirakami/|title=The Shirakami-Sanchi World Heritage Conservation Center|publisher=Ministry of Environment| accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical usage==
Most of the Japanese temperate rainforest has been logged and used as fuel and building materials over time. Before industrial development, people lived with the forest; they respected the forest and mountains. Mountain worship and mountain asceticism have been very common&lt;ref name="s10" /&gt; in Japan through the ages. However, industry and war have forced people to cut the forest. The natural old-growth forest has declined rapidly with economic development and the government's policies. Some areas are turned into [[plantation]] forest (secondary forest) of Japanese cedar, ''Quercus serrate'', and [[sawtooth oak]] (''Quercus acutissime'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Nakamura|first = Toshihiko|last2 = Honda|first2 =Yuko| title = Meaning and concept change of Satoyama and Satoumi|journal = Chiba Biodiversity Center Report|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These forests are known as [[Satoyama]] and were well-managed until the government changed its policies again. Takeuchi explains Satoyama as “secondary woodlands and grassland near human settlements that have traditionally used these lands as coppices and meadows for fuel, fertilizer, and fodder.”&lt;ref name="s14"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takeuchi|first = Kazuhito|title = Rebuilding the relationship between people and nature: the Satoyama Initiative|journal = Eco Res|volume= 25|year=2010| pages=891–897}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Increased importing of fossil fuel and timber changed the value of Satoyama in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="s14" /&gt;  The Japanese forest industry was reduced and people lost interest in forest management and timber harvesting. The population’s aging and loss of timber jobs caused population decrease in rural area, which made it difficult to maintain the Satoyama area. Today, however, society’s attention is being pulled back to the function of Satoyama and people have started to maintain the forest again.

==Disturbance and conservation==
Common disturbances in Japanese temperate rainforests are triggered by [[typhoon]]s that have a strong influence on both the forests and human populations. Typhoons cause trees to fall as well as floods and landslides. Although some trees falling is a normal part of the forest lifecycle, large numbers of trees falling  all at once can alter or damage the ecosystem.

Other recent concerns include damage by animals. Insect infestation and sika deer foraging have become big issues. Infestations by insects have increased rapidly since the 1980s,&lt;ref name="s15"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Kobayashi|first = K|last2 = Ueda|first2 = Akira|title=Wilt disease of ''Fagaceae'' Trees caused by ''Platyus quercivours'' (Coleoptera: Platypodidae) and the associated ''Fungas'': Aim is to clarify the damage factor.|journal=J. Jpn. For Soc.|volume=87|year=2005|pages=435-450}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the last decade,&lt;ref name="s15" /&gt;  and have impacted the forestry industry. The sika deer's foraging has a less direct impact on the forest itself; however, it represents about 60% of all damage from animals.&lt;ref name="s6" /&gt;  The deer also eat seedlings, which increases the risk of future canopy decline. Occasionally, sika deer attack orchards in search of food; this may suggest overpopulation of sika deer, possibly due to human impact on their habitat. Ongoing losses from land conversion and [[climate change]] also represent serious threats to the conservation of Japanese temperate rainforests.&lt;ref name="s2" /&gt;

[[File:Landlocked countries.svg|350px|thumb|right|Landlocked countries: 42 landlocked (green), 2 doubly landlocked (purple)]]

A '''landlocked state''' or '''landlocked country''' is a  [[sovereign state]] entirely enclosed by land, or whose only [[coast]]lines lie on [[endorheic basin|closed seas]]. There are currently 50 such countries, including five [[list of states with limited recognition|partially recognised states]]. Only two, [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] in [[South America]], lie outside [[Afro-Eurasia]] (the [[Old World]]).

As a rule, being landlocked creates political and economic handicaps that access to the [[international waters|high seas]] avoids. For this reason, states large and small across history have striven to gain access to open waters, even at great expense in wealth, bloodshed, and [[political capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Munim|first1=Ziaul Haque|last2=Haralambides|first2= Hercules |title= Competition and cooperation for intermodal container transhipment: A network optimization approach|journal=Research in Transportation Business &amp; Management|date=2018|pages=87–99|doi= 10.1016/j.rtbm.2018.03.004|url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210539517301001|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic disadvantages of being landlocked can be alleviated or aggravated depending on degree of development, language barriers, and other considerations. Some landlocked countries are quite affluent, such as [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Luxembourg]], and [[Austria]], all of which frequently employ [[Neutral country|neutrality]] to their political advantage.  The majority, however, are classified as [[Landlocked developing countries|Landlocked Developing Countries]] (LLDCs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paudel |first=R. C. |year=2012 |title=Growth and Export Performance of Developing Countries: Is Landlockedness Destiny? |chapter=Landlockedness and Economic Growth: New Evidence |publisher=Australian National University |location=Canberra, Australia |url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/12009/1/Paudel_R.C._2013.pdf |pages=13–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of the twelve countries with the lowest [[Human Development Index|Human Development Indices (HDI)]] are landlocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faye |first=M.

== Significance ==
[[Image:BoliviaChile.jpg|thumb|[[Bolivia]]'s loss of its coastline in the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1884) remains a major political issue]]

Historically, being landlocked has been disadvantageous to a country's development. It cuts a nation off from important sea resources such as [[fishing]], and impedes or prevents direct access to [[Maritime trade|seaborne trade]], a crucial component of economic and social advance.  As such, coastal regions tended to be wealthier and more heavily populated than inland ones. [[Paul Collier]] in his book ''[[The Bottom Billion]]'' argues that being landlocked in a poor geographic neighborhood is one of four major development "traps" by which a country can be held back. In general, he found that when a neighboring country experiences better growth, it tends to spill over into favorable development for the country itself. For landlocked countries, the effect is particularly strong, as they are limited in their trading activity with the rest of the world. He states, "If you are coastal, you serve the world; if you are landlocked, you serve your neighbors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bottom Billion |last=Collier |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Collier |coauthors= |year= 2007|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York |isbn=978-0-19-537338-7 |pages=56, 57 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that being landlocked may actually be a blessing as it creates a "natural tariff barrier" which protects the country from cheap imports. In some instances, this has led to more robust local food systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moseley |first=W.

Landlocked [[Developing country|developing countries]] have significantly higher costs of international cargo transportation compared to coastal developing countries (in Asia the ratio is 3:1).&lt;ref name=unctad160&gt;{{cite book |author=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) |authorlink=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development |editor= |others= |title=Review of Maritime Transport, 2010 |origyear= |url=http://www.unctad.org/Templates/Download.asp?docid=14218&amp;lang=1&amp;intItemID=2068 |page=160 |year=2010 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |location=New York and Geneva |format=PDF |isbn=978-92-1-112810-9 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Efforts to avoid being landlocked ===
{{more sources|section|date=August 2018}}
Countries thus have made particular efforts to avoid being landlocked, by acquiring land that reaches the sea:
* As result of a 2005 territorial exchange with [[Ukraine]], [[Moldova]] received a 600&amp;nbsp;m-long bank of the [[Danube River]] (which is an [[international waterway]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalwatersgovernance.com/danube-river-basin.html|title=Danube River Basin|publisher=International Waterway Governance|accessdate=June 30, 2018}})&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently building its [[Port of Giurgiulești]] there.
* The [[International Congo Society]], which owned the territory now constituting the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], was awarded a narrow piece of land cutting through [[Angola]] to connect it to the sea by the [[Conference of Berlin]] in 1885.
* The [[Republic of Ragusa]] once gave the town of [[Neum]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] because it did not want to have a land border with [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]; this small municipality was inherited by [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and now provides limited sea access, splitting the [[Croatia]]n part of the Adriatic coast in two. Since Bosnia and Herzegovina is a new country, railways and ports have not been built for its need. There is no freight port along its short coastline at [[Neum]], making it effectively landlocked, although there are plans to change this. Instead the [[port of Ploče]] in Croatia is used.
* After [[World War I]], in the [[Treaty of Versailles]], a part of [[Germany]] designated "the [[Polish corridor]]" was given to the new [[Second Polish Republic]], for access to the [[Baltic Sea]]. This gave [[Poland]] a short coastline, but without a large harbour. This was also the pretext for making Danzig (now [[Gdańsk]]) with its harbour the [[Free City of Danzig]], to which Poland was given free access. However, the Germans placed obstacles to this free access, especially when it came to military material. In response, the small fishing harbour of [[Gdynia]] was soon greatly enlarged.
* Until the dissolution of [[Austria–Hungary]] in 1918 at the end of World War I, [[Austrians]], [[Hungarians]] and that empire's other nationalities had served in that country's navy, but since then, [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]] have both been landlocked countries.

=== Trade agreements ===
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2018}}
Countries can make agreements on getting free transport of goods through neighbour countries:
* The [[Treaty of Versailles]] required Germany to offer [[Czechoslovakia]] a lease for 99 years of parts of the ports in [[Hamburg]] and [[Szczecin|Stettin]], allowing Czechoslovakia sea trade via the [[Elbe]] and [[Oder]] rivers. Stettin was annexed by [[Poland]] after [[World War II]], but [[Hamburg]] continued the [[contract]] so that part of the port (now called [[Moldauhafen]]) may still be used for sea trade by a successor of Czechoslovakia, the [[Czech Republic]].
* The [[Danube]] is an [[international waterway]], and thus landlocked Austria, Hungary, [[Moldova]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovakia]] have secure access to the [[Black Sea]] (the same access is given to inland parts of Germany and Croatia, though Germany and Croatia are not landlocked). However, oceangoing ships cannot use the Danube, so cargo must be transloaded anyway, and many overseas imports into Austria and Hungary use land transport from Atlantic and Mediterranean ports. A similar situation exists for the [[Rhine]] river where Switzerland has boat access, but not oceangoing ships. [[Luxembourg]] has such through the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]], but [[Liechtenstein]] has no boat access, even though it is located along the Rhine, as the Rhine is not navigable that far upstream.
* The [[Mekong River|Mekong]] is an [[international waterway]] so that landlocked [[Laos]] has access to the [[South China Sea]] (since Laos became independent from [[French Indochina]]). However, it is not navigable above the [[Khone Phapheng Falls]].
* [[Free port]]s allow transshipment to short-distance ships or river vessels.
* The [[TIR Treaty]] allows sealed road transport without customs checks and charges, mostly in Europe.

=== Political repercussions ===
{{more sources|section|date=August 2018}}
Losing access to the sea is generally a great blow to a nation, politically, militarily, and economically. The following are examples of countries becoming landlocked. 
* The independence of [[Eritrea]], brought about by successful separatist movements, has caused [[Ethiopia]] to become landlocked.
* [[Montenegro]]'s [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|decision]] to abandon the [[State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]] caused the [[Republic of Serbia (1990–2006)|federal unit of Serbia]] to become a landlocked [[Serbia|independent state]].
* [[Geography of Bolivia|Bolivia]] lost its coastline to [[Chile]] in the [[War of the Pacific]] and accepted it in treaties signed in 1884 and 1904. The last treaty gives port storage facilities and special treatment for the transit of goods from and to Bolivia through Chilean ports and territory. Peru and Argentina have also given special treatment for the transit of goods. A fluvial [[Bolivian Navy]], which did not exist at the time of the [[War of the Pacific]], was created later and both trains and operates in [[Lake Titicaca]] and rivers. The Bolivian people annually celebrate a patriotic "[[Dia del Mar]]" (Day of the Sea) to remember its territorial loss, which included both the coastal city of [[Antofagasta]] and what has proven to be one of the most significant and lucrative copper deposits in the world. Early in the 21st century, the selection of the route of gas pipes from Bolivia to the sea fueled [[Bolivian gas conflict#Dispute over pipeline route|popular uprisings]], as people were against the option of laying the pipes through Chilean territory.
* Austria and Hungary also lost their access to the sea as a consequence of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] (1919) and the [[Treaty of Trianon]] (1920) respectively. Previously, although [[Croatia]] had a limited constitutional [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the City of [[Fiume]]/[[Rijeka]] on the Croatian coast was governed directly from [[Budapest]] by an appointed governor as a ''[[corpus separatum (Fiume)|corpus separatum]]'', to provide Hungary with its only international [[port]] in the periods 1779–1813, 1822–1848 and 1868–1918.
* By 1801, the [[Nizam]]'s dominion of [[Hyderabad State]] assumed the shape it is now remembered for: that of a landlocked [[princely state]] with territories in central Deccan, bounded on all sides by [[British India]], whereas 150 years earlier it had had a [[Northern Circars|considerable coastline]] on the [[Bay of Bengal]] which was annexed by the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. N. |last=Chopra |first2=B. N. |last2=Puri |first3=M. N. |last3=Das |title=A Comprehensive History of India |volume=3 |page=298 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is possible that one of the causes of the [[Paraguayan War]] was [[Paraguay]]'s lack of direct ocean access (although this is disputed; see the linked article).
* When the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] divided the former [[Ottoman Empire]] under the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] at the close of [[World War I]], [[Armenia]] was promised part of the Trebizond vilayet (roughly corresponding to the modern [[Trabzon Province|Trabzon]] and [[Rize Province|Rize]] provinces in [[Turkey]]). This would have given Armenia access to the [[Black Sea]]. However, the Sèvres treaty collapsed with the [[Turkish War of Independence]] and was superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]], which firmly established Turkish rule over the area.
* In 2011, [[South Sudan]] broke off from [[Sudan]], causing the former to become landlocked. There still remains conflict over the oil fields in South Sudan between the two countries.

The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] now gives a landlocked country a right of access to and from the sea without taxation of traffic through transit states. The [[United Nations]] has a programme of action to assist landlocked developing countries,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/special-rep/ohrlls/lldc/default.htm UN Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928015547/http://www.un.org/special-rep/ohrlls/lldc/default.htm |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the current responsible Undersecretary-General is [[Anwarul Karim Chowdhury]].

Some countries have a long coastline, but much of it may not be readily usable for trade and commerce. For instance, in its early history, [[Russia]]'s only ports were on the [[Arctic Ocean]] and frozen shut for much of the year. The wish to gain control of a [[warm water port|warm-water port]] was a major motivator of Russian expansion towards the [[Baltic Sea]], [[Black Sea]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]. On the other hand, some landlocked countries can have access to the ocean along wide navigable rivers. For instance, Paraguay (and Bolivia to a lesser extent) have access to the ocean by the [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]] and [[Parana river|Parana]] rivers.

Several countries have coastlines on landlocked [[sea]]s, such as the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and the [[Dead Sea|Dead]]. Since these seas are in effect [[lake]]s without access to wider seaborne trade, countries such as [[Kazakhstan]] are still considered landlocked. Although the Caspian Sea is connected to the Black Sea via the man-made [[Volga–Don Canal]], large oceangoing ships are unable to traverse it.

== By degree ==
Landlocked countries may be bordered by a single country having direct access to the [[high seas]], two or more such countries, or be surrounded by other landlocked countries, making a country doubly landlocked.

=== Landlocked by a single country ===
Three countries are landlocked by a single country ([[Enclave and exclave|enclaved countries]]):

* [[Lesotho]], a state surrounded by [[South Africa]].
* [[San Marino]], a state surrounded by [[Italy]].
* [[Vatican City]], a state forming part of [[Rome]], thus surrounded by Italy.

=== Landlocked by two countries ===
Seven landlocked countries are surrounded by only two mutually bordering neighbours (semi-enclaved countries):

* [[Andorra]] (between [[France]] and [[Spain]])
* [[Bhutan]] (between [[India]] and [[China]])
* [[Eswatini]] (between [[South Africa]] and [[Mozambique]])
* [[Liechtenstein]] (one of the "doubly landlocked" countries, between [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]])
* [[Moldova]] (between [[Ukraine]] and [[Romania]])
* [[Mongolia]] (between [[Russia]] and China)
* [[Nepal]] (between India and China)

To this group could be added two ''[[de facto]]'' [[list of states with limited recognition|states with no or limited international recognition]]:

* [[South Ossetia]] (between Russia and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]])
* [[Transnistria]] (between Ukraine and [[Moldova]])

=== Doubly landlocked === &lt;!--Section redirected from [[Doubly landlocked country]]--&gt;
A country is "doubly landlocked" or "double-landlocked" when it is surrounded entirely by one or more landlocked countries (requiring the crossing of at least two national borders to reach a coastline).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geolounge.com/landlocked-countries/ |title=Landlocked Countries  |last1=Dempsey Morais |first1=Caitlin |date= |publisher=Geolounge |access-date=November 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geography.about.com/od/politicalgeography/a/landlocked.htm |title=Landlocked Countries |last1= |first1= |date= |publisher=[[About.com]] |access-date=November 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two such countries:
* [[Liechtenstein]] in [[Central Europe]], surrounded by [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00273120 |journal=GeoJournal |volume=28 |issue=4 |title=IGU regional conference on environment and quality of life in central Europe|year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Uzbekistan]] in [[Central Asia]], surrounded by [[Afghanistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Turkmenistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uz.html CIA World Factbook Uzbekistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no doubly landlocked countries from the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871 until the end of [[World War I]]. Liechtenstein bordered the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], which had an [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coastline, and Uzbekistan was then part of the [[Russian Empire]], which had both ocean and sea access.

With the [[dissolution of Austria-Hungary]] in 1918 and creation of an independent, landlocked [[Austria]], Liechtenstein became the sole doubly landlocked country until 1938. In the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Anschluss]] that year, Austria was absorbed into the [[Third Reich]], which possessed a border on the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[North Sea]]. After World War II, Austria regained its independence and Liechtenstein once again became doubly landlocked. 

Uzbekistan, which had been part of the [[Russian Empire]] and then the [[Soviet Union]], gained its independence with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the U.S.S.R.]] in 1991 and became the second doubly landlocked country.

However, Uzbekistan's doubly landlocked status depends on the [[Caspian Sea]]'s status dispute: some countries, especially [[Iran]] and [[Turkmenistan]], claim that the Caspian Sea should be considered as a real sea (mainly because this way they would have larger oil and gas fields), which would make Uzbekistan only a simple landlocked country because its neighbours Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan have access to the Caspian Sea.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

They can be grouped in ''contiguous'' groups as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ihs.ac.at/publications/tec/te-14.pdf |title=Economic Development Problems of Landlocked Countries |publisher=Wien Institute for Advanced Studies |page=12 |first1=Landis |last1=MacKellar |first2=Andreas |last2=Wörgötter |first3=Julia |last3=Wörz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Central Asian cluster (6): [[Afghanistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]]
* Central European cluster (9): [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Kosovo]] (partially recognized), [[Liechtenstein]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Switzerland]]
* West, Central and East African cluster (10): [[Burkina Faso]], [[Burundi]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Rwanda]], [[South Sudan]], [[Uganda]]
* South African cluster (4): [[Botswana]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]]
* Caucasian cluster (3): [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] (unrecognized)
* South American cluster (2): [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]]
If [[Transnistria]] is included then Moldova and Transnistria form their own cluster, listed in parentheses in the table.

If it were not for the {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline at [[Muanda]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] would join the two African clusters into one, making them the biggest contiguous group in the world. Also, the Central Asian and Caucasian clusters can be considered contiguous, joined by the landlocked Caspian Sea. Mongolia is almost part of this cluster too, being separated from Kazakhstan by only {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}}, across Russian or Chinese territory.

There are the following "single" landlocked countries (each of them borders no other landlocked country):

* Africa (2): [[Eswatini|Eswatini (Swaziland)]], [[Lesotho]]
* Asia (5): [[Bhutan]], [[Laos]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], [[West Bank]] (partially recognized)
* Europe (6): [[Andorra]], [[Belarus]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Moldova]] (if Transnistria is excluded), [[San Marino]], and the [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]]
* Caucasus (1): [[South Ossetia]] (partially recognized)

If the Caucasian countries and [[Kazakhstan]] are counted as part of [[Europe]], then Europe has the most landlocked countries, at 20. If these [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental countries]] are included in [[Asia]], then [[Africa]] has the most, at 16. Depending on the status of the three transcontinental countries, [[Asia]] has between 9 and 15, while [[South America]] has only 2. [[North America]] and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] are the only continents with no landlocked countries (not including [[Antarctica]], which has no countries).

&lt;!-- __239__ species: Please update number when adding new species --&gt;
The following is an incomplete list of some species of the [[mushroom]] genus ''[[Boletus]]''. The genus has a widespread distribution, and contains about 300 species.&lt;ref name=Kirk2008/&gt;  However, the genus is [[polyphyletic]] and approximately only 10 percent of the described species are actually members of the Boletus ''[[sensu stricto]]'' [[clade]] (Singer's ''[[Boletus]]'' section ''[[Boletus]]'', also known as the "Porcini Clade").&lt;ref name=Binder2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singer1986/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dentingeretal2010/&gt;

'''Endophytes''' are micro-organisms living within the tissue of a [[plant]] as [[endosymbionts]], without causing symptoms of [[plant disease|disease]]. Some of them are [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] symbionts with beneficial effects on their host, such as improved growth or resistance against disease or [[Abiotic stress|environmental stress]], and are being used as [[microbial inoculant]]s. However, [[pathogens]] and [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophytes]] may also be endophytic at some point of their life cycle. Endophytes are distinct from [[mycorrhizal]] fungi or [[rhizosphere]] microbes in that they live entirely within the plant. Most endophytes known are [[bacteria]] or [[fungi]], although there are also some endophytic [[algae]] and [[oomycetes]].

This list contains genera with endophytic species (but which may also have non-endophytic species). Species are only listed in notable cases. Where specific variants or [[cultivars]] of a species are endophytic, this is detailed on the taxon's page. The host range is "wide" when it does not include only a specific [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] of plants; in that case, the lineage is given.

There is only one year-round river in [[Egypt]], the [[Nile]]. It has no non-seasonal tributaries for its entire length in Egypt, though it has two further upstream, the [[Blue Nile]] and [[White Nile]], which merge in central [[Sudan]]. 

In the [[Nile Delta]], the river splits into a number of [[Distributary|distributaries]] and lesser channels. In ancient times there were '''seven distributaries''', of which only two are extant today due to silting and flood relief schemes; from east to west, they were:

* the Pelusiac
* the Tanitic,
* the Mendesian,
* the Phatnitic (extant; now the Damietta or Damyat),
* the Sebennytic,
* the Bolbitinic,
* the Canopic (extant; now the Rosetta or Rashid).

The Nile is intersected by a number of normally dry tributaries or [[wadi]]s which traverse the [[Eastern Desert]]. The wadis drain run-off rainfall from the mountains along the Egyptian [[Red Sea]] coast, though it only rarely reaches the main trunk of the wadis to flow downstream to the Nile. The three principal wadis are:

* Wadi Abbad (drainage area 7,000 km²)
* Wadi Shait (length 200 km, drainage area 10,000 km²)
* Wadi El-Kharit (length 260 km, drainage area 23,000 km²)

==Sinai==
Sinai haspe Mukattab]] ("The Valley of Writing") and the [[Wadi Feiran]] (associated with the biblical [[Rephidim]]).

[[File:Drauper freak wave.png|thumb|300px|The [[Draupner wave]], a single giant wave measured on New Year's Day 1995, finally confirmed the existence of freak waves, which had previously been considered near-mythical.]]
This '''list of rogue waves''' compiles incidents of known and likely [[rogue wave]]s – also known as ''freak waves'', ''monster waves'', ''killer waves'', and ''extreme waves''. These are relatively large and spontaneous [[ocean surface wave]]s that occur in deep water, usually far out at sea, and are a threat even to [[capital ship]]s and [[ocean liner]]s.

== Background ==
[[Anecdotal evidence]] from mariners' testimonies and damages inflicted on ships have long suggested rogue waves occurred; however, their scientific measurement was only positively confirmed following measurements of the "[[Draupner wave]]", a rogue wave at the [[Draupner platform]], in the [[North Sea]] on 1 January 1995. During this event, minor damage was inflicted on the platform, confirming that the reading was valid.

In modern [[oceanography]], rogue waves are defined not as the biggest possible waves at sea, but instead as extreme sized waves for a given sea state.

It should be noted that many of these encounters are only reported in the media, and are not examples of open ocean rogue waves. Often a huge wave is loosely denoted as a ''rogue wave'', when it is not. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}}
Although extremely large waves offer an explanation for the sudden, inexplicable disappearance of many ocean-going vessels. However, although this is a credible explanation for unexplained losses, the claim is contradicted by information held by [[Lloyd's Register]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lrfairplay.com/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106085401/http://www.lrfairplay.com/# |archive-date=6 January 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="200_ships_myth"&gt;The story that "200 large ships lost to freak waves in the past two decades" was published in ''[[The Times]]'' (May 2006). One of the first press releases, issued by the [[European Space Agency]] (cited at the page bottom), reported "200 large ships of 600 ft long or more in the past two decades sunk without a trace". At the time the claim was made, there were 142 modern ships of that size lost at sea,all with clear, known causes (source: [http://www.lrfairplay.com Lloyd's Register – Fairplay]). The main culprits were the [[Iran]]ian and [[Iraq]]i air forces in the 1980s (See: [[Iran-Iraq war]]).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the very few cases where evidence suggests a freak wave incident is the 1978 loss of the freighter ''München''.  

In 1991, the American fishing boat, Andrea Gail, was caught in a storm near the NE Atlantic coase of the USA.  Junger reported that the storm created waves in excess of 100 ft (30 m) in height, but ocean buoy monitors recorded a peak wave height of 39 feet (12 m), and so waves of 100 ft (30 m) were deemed "unlikely" by Science Daily.[4] However, data from a series of weather buoys in the general vicinity of the vessel's last known location recorded peak wave action exceeding 60 ft (18 m) in height from 28 through 30 October 1991.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

== Known or suspected rogue wave incidents ==

===Before 1950===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2009}}
* On 11 March 1861 at midday the [[lighthouse]] on [[Eagle Island, County Mayo|Eagle Island]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cil2.adnet.ie/index.php3?LighthouseID=34 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718224603/http://cil2.adnet.ie/index.php3?LighthouseID=34 |archivedate=18 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; off the west coast of [[Ireland]] was struck by a large wave that smashed 23 panes, washing some of the lamps down the stairs and damaging beyond repair the reflectors with broken glass. In order to damage the uppermost portion of the lighthouse, water would have had to surmount a seaside cliff measuring 40&amp;nbsp;m (133&amp;nbsp;ft) and a further 26&amp;nbsp;m (87&amp;nbsp;ft) of lighthouse structure.
* On 13 November 1865, the wooden [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] ''[[Aenid (ship)|Aenid]]'' was in the [[Tasman Sea]] near Long Reef off [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], when her helmsman sighted three huge waves approaching from her starboard quarter. Before he could turn the cutter to face them, they swamped ''Aenid'' and wrecked her with the loss of two lives. Four others on board survived. The wreck later was found washed up on Long Reef with part of its side stove in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13121609?searchTerm=Captain+Broughton+William+Wiseman "Wreck of the cutter yacht Aenid and supposed loss of life"], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 14 November 1865.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 15 December 1900, three lighthouse keepers [[Flannan Isles#Mystery of 1900|mysteriously disappeared]] from the [[Flannan Isles#Lighthouse|Flannan Isles Lighthouse]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]] of Scotland during a storm. Although there were no surviving witnesses, a rogue wave that hit the west side of the island has been hypothesized to be responsible.
* On 10 October 1903, the British passenger liner {{RMS|Etruria}} was only four hours out of [[New York City]] when, at 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., a freak wave struck her. The wave was reported to be at least {{Convert|50|ft|m}} high and struck the ship on the port side. The wave carried away part of the fore bridge and smashed the guardrail [[stanchion]]s. There were a number of first-class passengers sitting in deck chairs close to the bridge and they caught the full force of the water. One passenger was fatally injured and several other passengers were hurt.
* The Blue Anchor Line luxury steamer [[Waratah (ship)|SS ''Waratah'']], an Australian ship of 16,000 [[gross ton]]s, disappeared without trace south of [[Durban]], South Africa, in July 1909 with 211 passengers and crew aboard. No survivors or wreckage were found. The most plausible theory for her disappearance is that she encountered a rogue wave which either caused her to capsize or flooded her cargo holds, sinking her almost instantly.
* On 7 November 1915 at 2:27&amp;nbsp;a.m., the British battleship {{HMS|Albemarle|1901|6}} suffered severe damage during a storm in the [[Pentland Firth]] when two large waves struck her in rapid succession. Water rose as high as the bottom of her lower foretop, filling it with water, sweeping her forward deck clear, smashing her forebridge – much of which was found in pieces on her upper deck – wrecking her chart house, shifting the roof of her [[conning tower]], and flooding her forward main gun turret, mess decks, and flats. Five of her crew died, and 17 others suffered serious injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldweather.s3.amazonaws.com/ADM53-33201/ADM53-33201-010_1.jpg oldweather.com Log entries of HMS ''Albemarle''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="navalhistory"&gt;[http://www.naval-history.net/OWShips-WW1-01Albemarle.htm naval-history.net Royal Navy Logbooks of the World War I Era: HMS ALBEMARLE – March 1915 to November 1916, 3rd BS, Grand Fleet, damaged in gale Nov 1915, North Russia (icebreaker)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson Papers, National Museum of the Royal Navy, Portsmouth, U.K. 255/4/31.&lt;/ref&gt;
* At midnight on 5–6 May 1916 the British polar explorer [[Ernest Shackleton]] was at the tiller of the small sailboat [[James Caird (boat)|''James Caird'']] in the [[Southern Ocean]] during a storm when he thought he saw the bad weather clearing in the west, astern. He then realized that what he thought was a line of white clouds above a clear dark sky was actually the crest of a single enormous wave that struck and nearly swamped the boat. Shackleton [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition#Voyage of the James Caird|reported]] that the wave was larger than any he had ever seen before in his 26 years of seafaring.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Fowl.

* On 29 August 1916 at about 4:40&amp;nbsp;p.m., the [[United States Navy]] [[armored cruiser]] [[USS Tennessee (ACR-10)|USS ''Memphis'']] was wrecked in [[Santo Domingo]] harbor in the [[Dominican Republic]] when struck in rapid succession by three waves of up to 70 feet (21 meters) in height, causing 40 men to be killed and 204 to be injured. The waves also damaged and nearly capsized the U.S. Navy [[gunboat]] {{USS|Castine|PG-6|6}}, which also was in the harbor. Once described as a tsunami, the waves have more recently been assessed as exceptionally large, freak wind-driven waves generated by passing [[hurricane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;*Smith, Craig B.

* In February 1926 in the North Atlantic a massive wave hit the British passenger liner {{RMS|Olympic}}, smashing four of the bridge's nine glass windows and doing some other damage.&lt;ref name="Chirn"&gt;{{cite book | last = Chirnside | first = Mark | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Olympic-Class Ships | publisher = Tempus Publishing Ltd. | year = 2004 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7524-2868-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1933 in the [[North Pacific]], the U.S. Navy [[Oiler (ship)|oiler]] {{USS|Ramapo|AO-12}} encountered a huge wave. The crew triangulated its height at {{Convert|112|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="broad"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/11/science/11wave.html?8dpc Rogue Giants at Sea], Broad, William J, ''[[New York Times]]'', 11 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1934 in the North Atlantic an enormous wave smashed over the bridge of the British passenger liner {{RMS|Majestic}}, injuring the first officer and the [[White Star Line]]{{'}}s final commodore, Edgar J. Trant, who was hospitalised for a month and never sailed again.&lt;ref name="Chirn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="majestic"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thegreatoceanliners.com/majestic2.html| title= The Great Ocean Liners: Bismarck/Majestic (II)| author= Daniel Othfors| access-date= 8 September 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101014025400/http://www.thegreatoceanliners.com/majestic2.html#| archive-date= 14 October 2010| dead-url= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1942 while operating as a [[troopship]] and carrying 16,082 [[United States Army]] troops, the British passenger liner {{RMS|Queen Mary}} was broadsided during a gale by a {{Convert|92|ft|m|adj=on}} wave {{Convert|608|nmi|mi km}} from Scotland and nearly capsized. ''Queen Mary'' listed briefly about 52 degrees before slowly righting herself.
*In 1947, the crew of the raft ''[[Kon-Tiki]]'' reported encountering three gigantic waves in the Pacific Ocean on a calm day.  Author [[Thor Heyerdahl]], the leader of the ''Kon-Tiki'' voyage, said that they seemed to come out of nowhere.

===Second half of the 20th century===
* On 5 February 1963, the [[French Navy]] [[light cruiser]] ''[[French cruiser Jeanne d'Arc (1930)|Jeanne d'Arc]]'' encountered a rogue wave while serving as the [[training ship]] of the [[French Naval Academy]].&lt;ref name="IFREMER"&gt;[http://www.ifremer.fr/web-com/stw2004/rw/fullpapers/glorious.pdf The Glorious Three], 2004; retrieved 30 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1966, the Italian liner ''[[Michelangelo (ship)|Michelangelo]]'' was steaming toward [[New York City]] when a giant wave tore a hole in its superstructure, smashed heavy glass {{Convert|80|ft|m}} above the waterline, and killed a crewman and two passengers.&lt;ref name="broad"/&gt;
* The ''Wilstar'', a Norwegian tanker, suffered structural damage from a rogue wave in 1974.&lt;ref name="broad"/&gt;
* {{SS|Edmund Fitzgerald}} was a [[lake freighter]] that sank suddenly during a gale storm on 10 November 1975, while on [[Lake Superior]], on the [[Canada–United States border]]. The ship went down without a distress signal in Canadian waters about {{Convert|15|nmi|mi km}} from the entrance to Whitefish Bay (at {{Coord|46|59.9|N|85|6.6|W|}}). At the location of the wreck the water is {{Convert|530|ft|m}} deep. All 29 members of the crew perished.
* In October 1977, the tanker {{MS|Stolt Surf}} ran into a rogue wave on a voyage across the Pacific from Singapore to Portland, and the engineer took photos of a wave higher than the {{Convert|72|ft|m|adj=on}} bridge deck.&lt;ref name="Petersen"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060820111102/http://www.geocities.com/kp_diver/index111TheStorm.html The Storm: ''Stolt Surf'' in the North Pacific, 1977], Petersen, Karsten, 8 December 2003; retrieved 11 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The six-year-old, 37,134-ton barge carrier {{MS|München}} was lost at sea in 1978. At 3 a.m. on 12 December 1978 she sent out a garbled [[mayday (distress signal)|mayday]] message from the mid-Atlantic, but rescuers found only "a few bits of wreckage." This included an unlaunched lifeboat, stowed {{Convert|66|ft|m}} above the water line, which had one of its attachment pins "twisted as though hit by an extreme force." The Maritime Court concluded that "bad weather had caused an unusual event." It is thought that a large wave knocked out the ship's controls (the bridge was sited forward), causing the ship to shift side-on to heavy seas, which eventually overwhelmed it. Although more than one wave was probably involved, this remains the most likely sinking due to a freak wave.&lt;ref name="Horizon"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2002/freakwave.shtml Freak Wave], [[BBC.co.uk]] programme summary for ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' episode aired on 14 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ''[[Ocean Ranger]]'' ([[North Atlantic]], 1981), a [[semi-submersible]] mobile [[oil platform|offshore drilling unit]] sank with all hands in storm seas of {{Convert|55|ft|m}} to {{Convert|65|ft|m}} after a wave higher than 28 feet (8.5&amp;nbsp;m) flooded the platform's ballast control room, although there has been no official suggestion that it was caused by a rogue wave.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
*The [[Fastnet Rock|Fastnet Lighthouse]] off the south coast of [[Ireland]] was struck by a 47-meter-high (154-foot-high) wave in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12792727 "The Story of the Fastnet"] – ''[[The Economist]] Magazine'' 18 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=August 2016}}

* In February 2000, a British oceanographic research vessel, the [[RRS Discovery (1962)|RRS ''Discovery'']], sailing in the [[Rockall Trough]] west of Scotland encountered the largest waves ever recorded by scientific instruments in the open ocean, with a [[significant wave height]] of {{convert|18.5|m|ft}} and individual waves up to {{convert|29.1|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Rockall"&gt;Holliday, NP, MJ Yelland, RW Pascal, VR Swail, PK Taylor, CR Griffiths, and EC Kent (2006).

* On 4 November 2000, the [[Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary]] [[research vessel]] [[R/V Ballena|R/V ''Ballena'']] was hit by a rogue wave and capsized near [[Point Conception]] off [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]]. The ship was {{Convert|56|ft|m}} long, and the wave estimated at {{Convert|20|ft|m}} high.  Two [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) crew members were trapped briefly inside the capsized ship, but they were able to find their way to the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] doors and escaped.  The [[life raft]] was inflated and the three attempted to paddle out of the surf zone.  The size of the raft and drogue anchor prevented escape in the raft.  The USGS crew donned the two available life jackets and all three attempted to swim to a pocket beach on [[Point Arguello]]. After the [[Sea captain|captain]] made shore he swam back out to assist both of the USGS crew to shore. One USGS crew member was treated for facial lacerations and a slight concussion. ''Ballena'', operated by [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) at the time, broke apart in the waves against the rocky shore and was a total loss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/news/features/news011119.html National Marine Sanctuaries News, 19 November 2001].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10442">The '''Marangoni effect''' (also called the '''Gibbs–Marangoni effect''') is the [[mass transfer]] along an [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] between two fluids due to a [[gradient]] of the [[surface tension]]. In the case of temperature dependence, this phenomenon may be called '''thermo-capillary convection'''&lt;ref name="comsol1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comsol.com/showroom/gallery/110/ |title=Marangoni Convection |publisher=COMSOL |date= |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or '''Bénard–Marangoni convection''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Getling|first1=A.V.|title=Rayleigh-Bénard convection : structures and dynamics|date=1998|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|location=Singapore|isbn=981-02-2657-8|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This phenomenon was first identified in the so-called "[[tears of wine]]" by physicist [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]] ([[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]]'s brother) in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;James Thomson (1855) [https://books.google.com/books?id=MVIwAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA330#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "On certain curious Motions observable at the Surfaces of Wine and other Alcoholic Liquors,"] ''Philosophical Magazine'', '''10''' : 330-333.&lt;/ref&gt; The general effect is named after [[Italy|Italian]] physicist [[Carlo Marangoni]], who studied it for his doctoral dissertation at the [[University of Pavia]] and published his results in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;C. Marangoni, ''Sull'espansione delle goccie d'un liquido galleggianti sulla superficie di altro liquido'' (On the expansion of a droplet of a liquid floating on the surface of another liquid) (Pavia, Italy:  fratelli Fusi (Fusi brothers), 1869).&lt;/ref&gt; A complete theoretical treatment of the subject was given by [[J. Willard Gibbs]] in his work ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]'' (1875-8).&lt;ref&gt;Josiah Willard Gibbs (1878) "On the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances.  Part II," ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences'', '''3''' :  343-524.  The equation for the energy that's required to create a surface between two phases appears on [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZsQAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA483#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 483].  Reprinted in:  Josiah Willard Gibbs with Henry Andrews Bumstead and Ralph Gibbs van Name, ed.s, ''The Scientific Papers of J. Willard Gibbs, ...'', vol. 1, (New York, New York:  Longmans, Green and Co., 1906), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8RhWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA315#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 315].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[File:Marangoni effect experimental demonstration.ogv|thumb|Marangoni effect experimental demonstration]]
[[File:Wine legs shadow.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Tears of wine]] show clearly in the shadow of this glass of wine with a 13.5% alcohol content]]

Since a liquid with a high surface tension pulls more strongly on the surrounding liquid than one with a low surface tension, the presence of a gradient in surface tension will naturally cause the liquid to flow away from regions of low surface tension. The surface tension gradient can be caused by concentration gradient or by a temperature gradient (surface tension is a function of temperature).

As an example, [[wine]] may exhibit a visible effect called "tears", as shown in the photograph. The effect is a consequence of the fact that alcohol has a lower surface tension and higher volatility than water. The water/alcohol solution rises up the surface of the glass due to [[capillary action]]. Alcohol evaporates from the film leaving behind liquid with a higher surface tension (more water, less alcohol). This region with a lower concentration of alcohol (greater surface tension) pulls on the surrounding fluid more strongly than the regions with a higher alcohol concentration (lower in the glass). The result is the liquid is pulled up until its own weight exceeds the force of the effect, and the liquid drips back down the vessel's walls. This can also be easily demonstrated by spreading a thin film of water on a smooth surface and then allowing a drop of alcohol to fall on the center of the film. The liquid will rush out of the region where the drop of alcohol fell.

The [[Marangoni number]], a dimensionless value, can be used to characterize the relative effects of surface tension and viscous forces.

A very detailed mathematical treatment of this from the point of view of the [[Navier–Stokes equation]]s and the equations of [[thermodynamics]] can be found in the first third of [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar|Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar's]] Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandrasekhar|first1=S.|title=Hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability|date=1981|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=978-0486640716|edition=[Dover ed.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally published in 1961 by Oxford, and republished by Dover in 1981.

==Significance to transport phenomena==
{{main|Transport phenomena (engineering &amp; physics)}}

Under earth conditions, the effect of gravity causing [[natural convection]] in a system with a temperature gradient along a fluid/fluid interface is usually much stronger than the Marangoni effect. Many experiments ([[ESA]] MASER 1-3) have been conducted under [[Micro-g environment|microgravity conditions]] aboard [[sounding rockets]] to observe the Marangoni effect without the influence of gravity. Research on [[heat pipes]] performed on the [[International Space Station]] revealed that whilst heat pipes exposed to a temperature gradient on Earth cause the inner fluid to evaporate at one end and migrate along the pipe, thus drying the hot end, in space (where the effects of gravity can be ignored) the opposite happens and the hot end of the pipe is flooded with liquid.&lt;ref&gt;Overview article: http://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.146105?referer=rss Technical research paper: http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.146105&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the Marangoni effect, together with [[capillary action]]. The fluid is drawn to the hot end of the tube by capillary action. But the bulk of the liquid still ends up as a droplet a short distance away from the hottest part of the tube, explained by Marangoni flow. The temperature gradients in axial and radial directions makes the fluid flow away from the hot end and the walls of the tube, towards the center axis. The liquid forms a droplet with a small contact area with the tube walls, a thin film circulating liquid between the cooler droplet and the liquid at the hot end.

The effect of the Marangoni effect on heat transfer in the presence of gas bubbles on the heating surface (e.g., in subcooled nucleate boiling) has long been ignored, but it is currently a topic of ongoing research interest because of its potential fundamental importance to the understanding of heat transfer in boiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petrovic|first1=Sanja|last2=Robinson|first2=Tony|last3=Judd|first3=Ross L.|title=Marangoni heat transfer in subcooled nucleate pool boiling|journal=International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer|date=November 2004|volume=47|issue=23|pages=5115–5128|doi=10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2004.05.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and application==
A familiar example is in [[soap film]]s: the Marangoni effect ''stabilizes'' soap films. Another instance of the Marangoni effect appears in the behavior of convection cells, the so-called [[Bénard cells]].

One important application of the Marangoni effect is the use for drying [[silicon]] [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]]s after a wet processing step during the manufacture of [[integrated circuits]]. Liquid spots left on the wafer surface can cause oxidation that damages components on the wafer. To avoid spotting, an [[alcohol]] [[vapor]] (IPA) or other organic compound in gas, vapor, or aerosol form is blown through a [[nozzle]] over the wet wafer surface (or at the meniscus formed between the cleaning liquid and wafer as the wafer is lifted from an immersion bath), and the subsequent Marangoni effect causes a surface-tension gradient in the liquid allowing gravity more easily to pull the liquid completely off the wafer surface, effectively leaving a dry wafer surface.

A similar phenomenon has been creatively utilized to self-assemble nanoparticles into ordered arrays&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cai|first1=Yangjun|last2=Zhang Newby|first2=Bi-min|title=Marangoni Flow-Induced Self-Assembly of Hexagonal and Stripelike Nanoparticle Patterns|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=May 2008|volume=130|issue=19|pages=6076–6077|doi=10.1021/ja801438u|pmid=18426208}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to grow ordered nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Wei Cheat|last2=Fang|first2=Yuanxing|last3=Kler|first3=Rantej|last4=Canciani|first4=Giacomo E.|last5=Draper|first5=Thomas C.|last6=Al-Abdullah|first6=Zainab T.Y.|last7=Alfadul|first7=Sulaiman M.|last8=Perry|first8=Christopher C.|last9=He|first9=Heyong|title=Marangoni ring-templated vertically aligned ZnO nanotube arrays with enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S025405841400697X|journal=Materials Chemistry and Physics|volume=149-150|pages=12–16|doi=10.1016/j.matchemphys.2014.10.046}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alcohol containing nanoparticles is spread on the substrate, followed by blowing the substrate with a humid air flow. The alcohol is evaporated under the flow. Simultaneously, water condenses and forms microdroplets on the substrate. Meanwhile, the nanoparticles in alcohol are transferred into the microdroplets and finally form numerous coffee rings on the substrate after drying.

The Marangoni effect is also important to the fields of [[welding]], [[crystal growth]] and [[electron beam]] melting of metals.&lt;ref name="comsol1"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Marebito'''''|稀人}} ''Unique One'' is a 2004 [[Japanese horror]] film directed by [[Takashi Shimizu]].

==Plot==

Masuoka ([[Shinya Tsukamoto]]) carries a camera everywhere he goes. He becomes obsessed with the idea of [[fear]] when he sees a frightened man shove a knife in his eye to commit suicide. Wishing to understand the fear that the man must have felt before his death, Masuoka descends into a labyrinthine underground area beneath the city, where he sees human-like creatures that walk on their hands and knees and whimper like dogs. While searching the series of tunnels and passages, Masuoka encounters a homeless inhabitant who warns him about the [[Richard Sharpe Shaver|Deros]]. He then meets the ghost of Kuroki, the man who killed himself, and learns more about the underworld. After hours of searching, Masuoka discovers a mountain range with a village built by the underground dwellers. He finds a naked girl ([[Tomomi Miyashita]]) chained to a wall. He takes her back to his apartment and notices she doesn't eat, drink, or speak.  

The girl, whom Masuoka dubs 'F', appears to be something other than human, and Masuoka becomes obsessed with understanding her. He sets up cameras that enable him to observe her from his cell phone when he leaves the apartment, and checks on her regularly. On a trip to the shopping mall, he sees F speaking to someone off camera, and a menacing man in black appears behind him. When he returns to the apartment, a woman in a yellow jacket is hiding in the stairway outside his door. Inside, he finds F convulsing, and unsuccessfully attempts to feed her. He discovers that twelve seconds of camera footage is missing, and receives a mysterious phone call from a pay phone call warning him that he is in serious trouble.

After being beaten with his camera by a stranger whom he filmed, Masuoka cuts his finger on the broken lens and returns home. He discovers that F survives on blood when she licks his finger, and cuts himself to feed her further. Masuoka begins to care for her by providing animal carcasses, deciding to treat F more as a pet than a human. The woman in yellow confronts him in the street, saying the girl is his daughter Fuyumi and asking where she is. Masuoka denies having a daughter and runs away, returning to the apartment to find it has been broken into and F missing. He wanders the streets searching for F and encounters the man in black, who expresses his disappointment in Masuoka's handling of her, speaking to him telepathically in the same voice as in the phone call. When Masuoka gets back to the apartment, he finds that F has returned and sees her hands are bloody.

When Masuoka leaves his apartment, the woman in yellow follows and demands that he speak to her. He walks to an alley without speaking, and turns his camera on. The woman says she wants to see her girl, at which point Masuoka stabs her to death. Later, he murders a young girl whom he met under the pretense of filming pornography. He drains their blood into bottles and feeds it to F. Masuoka calls the pay phone and speaks to the stranger, who agrees that Masuoka is taking better care of F now. While filming for a news crew at the scene of the second murder, Masuoka sees a woman he filmed in her apartment previously. He takes F out of the apartment, and leaves her in a [[karaoke]] room to travel on his own for a period. Sitting on a dock, Masuoka discusses his interest in fear with Kuroki.

Masuoka becomes homeless and sleeps in the park where he killed the young girl. He briefly admits to himself that he murdered his wife and a stranger and treated his daughter like an animal, before seeing a pair of Deros and finding a cell phone that leads him back to his apartment to find F. His wife's ghost appears behind Masuoka in the elevator, and he enters the apartment to find F weak on the floor. She speaks to him for the first time, and he cuts his mouth at the corner to feed her.  At the end of the film, F leads Masuoka back down into the underworld, and films him as it appears he has finally discovered the same fear that initially intrigued him.

==Critical analysis==

At different points in the film, different explanations are given for what is happening to Masuoka.  Early conversations in the film seem to suggest that the underground tunnels and F herself may be a physical manifestation of human ideas.  The film repeatedly references dangerous creatures called the Dero who live underground, named after the "detrimental robots" in [[Richard Sharpe Shaver]]'s ''A Warning to Future Man''.  At a later point in the film, it is suggested that Masuoka is insane and delusional, perhaps because he has stopped taking [[Prozac]], and that his delusions have led him to kill innocent people and treat his daughter like an animal.  The end of the film offers no concrete explanation.

In their book ''Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft'', Andrew Migliore and John Strysik write: "''Marebito'' is a very good film that wears its influences proudly, without suffocating in their embrace. It's neither an adaptation nor an homage, but it swells with inspiration from [[Lovecraft]]'s work. It's unconventional, free from cliché, and redolent with sinister insinuations that never become clear. You know them only by their shadows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Migliore |first1=Andrew |last2=Strysik |first2=John |title=Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P.

==Production==

The film was made on digital video between the shooting of ''[[Ju-on: The Grudge]]'' and ''[[The Grudge]]''.

'''Mount Agung''' or '''Gunung Agung''' is a volcano in [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]], southeast of [[Mount Batur|Mt Batur]] volcano, also in Bali. Gunung Agung [[stratovolcano]] is the highest point on Bali. It dominates the surrounding area, influencing the climate, especially rainfall patterns. From a distance, the mountain appears to be perfectly conical. From the peak of the mountain, it is possible to see the peak of [[Mount Rinjani|Mt Rinjani]] on the nearby island of [[Lombok]], to the east, although both mountains are frequently covered in clouds.

Gunung Agung is an [[active volcano]], with a large and deep crater that occasionally emits smoke and ash. 

Having begun in 2017, this volcano's latest eruption is [[2017–2018 eruptions of Mount Agung|ongoing]] as of 2018 .&lt;ref name="Smithsonian GVP"/&gt;

== Eruptions ==
=== 1843 eruption ===

Agung erupted in 1843,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hl-128-171-57-22.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/7320/1/vol19n4-498-501.pdf |title=Pioneer Plants Found One Year After the 1963 Eruption of Agung in Bali |date=October 1965 |author=Anwari Dilmy |publisher=Pacific Science, Vol. XIX |accessdate=27 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as recorded in a report by [[Heinrich Zollinger]]:

{{quote|text="After having been dormant for a long time, this year the mountain began to be alive again. In the first days of the activity earthquake shocks were felt after which followed the emission of ash, sand and stones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.volcanolive.com/agung.html |title=Agung Volcano |author=John Seach |publisher=Volcano Live |accessdate=27 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== 1963–64 Eruption ===
The eruption of 1963 was one of the largest and most devastating eruptions in Indonesia's history.

On February 18, 1963, local residents heard loud explosions and saw clouds rising from the crater of Mount Agung. On February 24, [[lava]] began flowing down the northern slope of the mountain, eventually traveling 7&amp;nbsp;km in the next 20 days. On March 17, the volcano erupted ([[VEI 5]]), sending debris 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;km into the air and generating massive [[pyroclastic flow]]s.&lt;ref name="esdm"&gt;

| accessdate = 2010-11-20
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These flows devastated numerous villages, killing an estimated 1,100–1,500 people. Cold [[lahar]]s caused by heavy rainfall after the eruption killed an additional 200. A second eruption on May 16 led to pyroclastic flows that killed another 200 inhabitants. Minor eruptions and flows followed and lasted almost a year.&lt;ref name="cna-Agung"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/once-tremors-detected-bali-volcano-can-erupt-within-hours-9269148 |title=Once tremors detected, Bali volcano can erupt within hours: Volcanologist |date=3 October 2017 |author=Pichayada Promchertchoo |publisher=CNA |accessdate=27 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adsabs"&gt;

The lava flows missed, sometimes by mere yards, the [[Mother Temple of Besakih]]. The saving of the temple is regarded by [[Balinese people|Balinese]] as miraculous and a signal from the gods that they wished to demonstrate their power but not destroy the monument that the Balinese had erected. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

'''2017'''

* In September 2017, the area experienced 844 volcanic earthquakes, peaking at 300 to 400 earthquakes on 26 September. The frequency and intensity of these quakes caused much alarm among seismologists, as similar volcanoes have historically been known to erupt with even fewer warning signs.&lt;ref name="cna-Agung"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/26/bali-volcano-eruption-seismic-activity-mount-agung|title=Bali volcano eruption could be hours away after unprecedented seismic activity|last=Lamb|first=Kate|date=2017-09-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In late September, as a result of the increased rumbling and seismic activity around the volcano, the alert level was raised to the highest level and about 122,500 people were evacuated from their houses around the volcano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesian official: More than 120,000 flee Bali volcano |work=Fox News |date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management|Indonesian National Disaster Management Authority]] declared a 12-kilometre exclusion zone around the volcano on 24 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/thousands-evacuated-as-bali-volcano-sparks-fear/news-story/7a323056f5e512345575a14cf4e1f213|title=Thousands evacuated as Bali volcano sparks fear|date=24 September 2017|agency=[[The Australian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evacuees gathered in sports halls and other community buildings around [[Klungkung]], [[Karangasem Regency|Karangasem]], [[Buleleng]], and other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ubudhood.com/mount-agung-facts/|title=Mount Agung: facts about Bali's imminent volcano eruption|date=September 23, 2017|work=UbudHood|access-date=November 1, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monitoring station is located in Tembuku, Rendang, [[Karangasem Regency|Karangasem]] Regency, from which the intensity and frequency of tremors were closely monitored for signs of imminent eruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-25/how-do-experts-know-mount-agung-is-about-to-erupt/8985974|title=How do experts know Mount Agung is about to erupt?|date=September 25, 2017|work=ABC News Australia|access-date=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On 27 November the Indonesian National Disaster Management Authority announced that the level of alert had been raised from Level 3 (Siaga, or ''Alert'') to Level 4 (Awas, or ''Warning''), the highest official warning level, as from 6.00 am on 27 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bnpb.go.id/home/detail/3540/AWAS-GUNUNG-AGUNG,-STATUS-DINAIKKAN-DARI-SIAGA-KE-AWAS |title=Awas Gunung Agung, Status Dinaikkan Dari SIAGA Ke AWAS |publisher=[[Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana]] (BNPB – National Disaster Management Authority) |date=27 November 2017 |accessdate=5 December 2017 |language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, a general warning was issued for all persons to refrain from any activity of any kind in the Estimated Danger Zone (''Zona Perkiraan Bahaya'') located within 8&amp;nbsp;km of the crater of Gunung Agung and, as well, in the wider sectoral area in the northeast region towards the sea and the south and southeastern hinterland of the mountain out to 10&amp;nbsp;km from the crater.
* In the beginning of December, the eruption powered down to minor emissions of steam and smoke. There were no reports of new [[volcanic ash]] on ground.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/agung/news/66306/Agung-volcano-Volcanic-Ash-Advisory-MINOR-SMOKESTEAM-EMISSION-TO-FL130-OBS-VA-DTG-022150Z.html Volcanodiscovery update]&lt;/ref&gt; Flights were suspended for about three days, and were resumed by 4 December.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bali-volcano-latest-flights-indonesia-mount-agung-island-steam-ash-eruption-a8091476.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* An eruption causing an ash plume some 2&amp;nbsp;km high occurred on the morning of 8 December, the ash being carried westward away from main population centres on the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/world/balis-mount-agung-spews-two-kms-ash-column-volcano-indonesia-4973634/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 12 December a picture of the crater was taken showing a steadily growing [[lava dome]] occupying approximately one third of the crater. Three scenarios are possible: 1. Eruption stops as no more gas is available to bring more lava to surface. 2. Lava dome continues to grow slowly, bringing no explosive eruptions. In this scenario the main danger would be if the summit crater fills up, as the dome could collapse producing massive [[pyroclastic flow]]s. 3. The lava dome forms a crust with gasses collecting underneath, until a critical pressure build-up would lead to a violent plinian eruption.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/agung/news/66532/Gunung-Agung-volcano-Bali-Indonesia-flat-lava-dome-occupying-summit-crater.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2018'''

* Agung remained on the boil until late June 2018 when it again erupted with 2 km high plumes interrupting air traffic. This indicated that magma continued to be forced up to the summit.
* On 3 July a strombolian explosion occurred, sending debris in all directions. This indicated that a lava dome had exploded the crust away, the magma being gaseous enough to ensure the top of the dome exploded away avoiding splitting the side of the dome and spewing the entire contents of the dome down the side of the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=700 flee 'thunderous' explosions and lava as Mount Agung erupts again |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-03/mt-agung-erupts-again-in-bali-indonesia/9935190 |website=ABC News |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=6 September 2018 |language=en-AU |date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious beliefs==
[[Balinese people]] believe that Mt Agung is a replica of [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Mt Meru]], the central axis of the universe. The most important temple on Bali, [[Pura Besakih]], is located high on the slopes of Gunung Agung.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, pp. 4,63&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3121">'''NIOSH air filtration rating''' refers to the publications of [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) of US government pertaining to respirators and masks worn to filter contaminated air, regardless of cause.

== NIOSH Ratings ==
The first part of the filter's classification uses the letters N, R, or P to indicate the filter's ability to function when exposed to oils.

* "N" = not resistant to oil 
* "R" = somewhat Resistant to oil
* "P" = strongly resistant to oil

The second part lists the percentage of particles that the mask is certified to block (such as 95 or 97 percent).

The most common is N95,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NIOSH-Approved Respirators |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource1quest1.html |website=The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is recommended by the [[US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) for most cases of air contamination.  These filters are designed to seal tightly around mouth and nose and are made of material certified to block 95% of particles 0.3 μm or larger in diameter, roughly the size of a single virus&lt;ref name="medpage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/InfectionControl/16278|title=Unmasking the Surgical Mask: Does It Really Work?|date=5 October 2009|work=medpagetoday.com|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and include [[PM2.5]]. 

They are however ''"...relatively difficult to breath through..."'',&lt;ref name="medpage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;  {{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n95list1.html|title=CDC - NIOSH-Approved N95 Particulate Filtering Facepiece Respirators - 3M Suppliers List|date=2018-06-28|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their full effectiveness also depends on a good fit - NIOSH recommends that each respirator wearer receive "''...an initial fit test and annual fit tests thereafter''".&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt;

==Contrast with plain surgical mask==
Plain [[surgical masks]] are standard for staff in hospital operating rooms, and often recommended to the public as part of avoiding seasonal flu.&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brosseau |first1=Lisa |title=N95 Respirators and Surgical Masks |url=https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2009/10/14/n95/ |website=NIOSH Science Blog |publisher=CDC |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They do not carry a NIOSH rating. They are designed to filter out relatively large particles, such as sputum droplets and hair - but the [[World Health Organization]], [[Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America]], the [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]], the [[Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology]], and the [[American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine]] all recommend these except in cases of "high risk".&lt;ref name="medpage"/&gt;

'''Nectar robbing''' is a foraging behavior utilized by some organisms that feed on floral nectar. "Nectar robbers" usually feed from holes bitten in flowers, rather than by entering through the flowers' natural openings. Often, nectar robbers avoid contact with the floral reproductive structures, and therefore do not facilitate plant reproduction via [[pollination]]. Because many species that act as pollinators also act as nectar robbers, nectar robbing is considered to be a form of exploitation of plant-pollinator [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]].

Nectar robbers vary greatly in species diversity and include species of [[carpenter bee]]s, [[bumblebee]]s, stingless ''[[Trigona (genus)|Trigona]]'' bees, solitary bees, [[wasp]]s, [[ant]]s, [[hummingbird]]s, [[Passerine Birds|passerine birds]], and [[Diglossa (bird)|flowerpiercer birds]].&lt;ref name="Maloof"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Are nectar robbers cheaters or mutualists? |author1=Maloof, J. E. |author2=Inouye, D. W. | date=2000 | journal=Ecology | volume=81 | issue=10 | pages=2651–2661 | doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[2651:ANRCOM]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nectar robbing mammals include a [[fruit bat]]&lt;ref&gt;Olmos, F.; Boulhosa, R.

==History==
Records of nectar robbing in nature date back at least to 1793 when German naturalist [[Christian Konrad Sprengel]] observed bumblebees perforating flowers.&lt;ref name="IrwinBronstein"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Irwin |first=Rebecca E. |last2=Bronstein |first2=Judith L. |last3=Manson |first3=Jessamyn S. |last4=Richardson |first4=Leif |date=2010-11-02 |title=Nectar Robbing: Ecological and Evolutionary Perspectives|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120330 |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=271–292 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120330 |issn=1543-592X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] observed bumblebees stealing nectar from flowers in 1859.&lt;ref name="IrwinBronstein" /&gt;

== Forms of floral larceny ==

Nectar robbing is specifically the behavior of consuming nectar from a perforation (robbing hole) in the floral tissue rather than from the floral opening. There are two main types of nectar robbing: primary robbing, which requires that the nectar forager perforates the floral tissues itself, and secondary robbing, which is foraging from a robbing hole created by a primary robber.&lt;ref name="Inouye"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Inouye |first=David W. |date=1980 |title=The Terminology of Floral Larceny |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/1936841/abstract |journal=Ecology |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=1251–1253 |doi=10.2307/1936841}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "floral larceny" has been proposed to include the entire suite of foraging behaviors for floral rewards that can potentially disrupt pollination.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004"&gt;{{cite journal |date=2004 |title=The dual role of floral traits: pollinator attraction and plant defence |journal=Ecology |volume=85 |issue=6 |pages=1503–1511|doi=10.1890/03-0390|author=Irwin, R. E., Adler, L. S.; Brody, A. K.|url=https://works.bepress.com/lynn_adler/4/download/}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include "nectar theft" (floral visits that remove nectar from the floral opening without pollinating the flower), and "base working" (removing nectar from in between petals, which generally bypasses floral reproductive structures).&lt;ref name="Inouye" /&gt;

Pollination systems are mostly mutualistic, meaning that the plant benefits from the pollinator's transport of male [[gamete]]s and the pollinator benefits from a reward, such as [[pollen]] or nectar.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt; As nectar robbers receive the rewards without direct contact with the reproductive parts of the flower, their behaviour is easily assumed to be [[cheating (biology)|cheating]]. However, the effect of robbery on the plant is sometimes neutral or even positive.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morris, W. F. |year=1996 |title=Mutualism denied? Nectar-robbing bumble bees do not reduce female or male success of bluebells |journal=Ecology |volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=1451–1462 |doi=10.2307/2265542}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Irwin2003"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Impact of nectar robbing on estimates of pollen flow: conceptual predictions and empirical outcomes | author=Irwin, R.

E. | year = 2001 | title = The effects of a bumble bee nectar robber on plant reproductive success and pollinator behavior | url = | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 88 | issue = 11| pages = 1960–1965 | doi=10.2307/3558423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of floral-nectar robbing on plant [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] depends on several issues. Firstly, nectar robbers such as carpenter bees, bumble bees and some birds can pollinate flowers.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt; [[Pollination]] may take place when the body of the robber contacts the reproductive parts of the plant while it robs, or during pollen collection which some bees practice in concert with nectar robbing.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irwin"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Nectar Robbing in Ipomopsis aggregata: effects on pollinator behaviour and plant fitness |author1=Irwin, R. E.  |author2=Brody, A. K. | date=1998 | journal=Oecologia | volume=116 | pages=519–527 | doi=10.1007/s004420050617 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of ''Trigona'' bees (e.g. ''Trigona ferricauda'') on a plant is almost always negative, probably because their aggressive [[territory (animal)|territorial behaviour]] effectively evicts legitimate pollinators.&lt;ref name="Roubic"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The ecological impact of nectar robbing bees and pollinating humming birds on a tropical shrub | author=Roubic, D. W. | date=1982 | journal=Ecology | volume=63 | issue=2 | pages=354–360 | doi=10.2307/1938953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nectar robbers may change the behaviour of legitimate pollinators in other ways, such as by reducing the amount of nectar available. This may force pollinators to visit more flowers in their nectar foraging. The increased number of flowers visited and longer flight distances increase pollen flow and [[outcrossing]], which is beneficial for the plant because it lessens [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt; This requires a robber's not completely consuming all of a flower's nectar. When a robber consumes all of a flower's nectar, legitimate pollinators may avoid the flower, resulting in a negative effect on plant fitness.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt;

The response of different species of legitimate pollinators also varies. Some species, like the bumble bees ''[[Bombus appositus]]'' or ''[[Western bumblebee|B. occidentalis]]'' and many species of nectar-feeding birds can distinguish between robbed and unrobbed plants and minimize their energy cost of [[foraging]] by avoiding heavily robbed flowers.&lt;ref name="Irwin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bentley, Barbara |author2=Elias, Thomas |year=1983 |title=The Biology of Nectaries |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn= |pages=}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollinating birds may be better at this than insects, because of their higher sensory capability.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt; The ways that bees distinguish between robbed and unrobbed flowers have not been studied, but they have been thought to be related to the damage on [[petal]] tissue after robbery or changes in nectar quality.&lt;ref name="Irwin" /&gt; ''[[Xylocopa varipuncta]]'' steals nectar through a slit they make in the base of the petals. If nectar robbing severely reduces the success of legitimate pollinators they may be able to switch to other nectar sources.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt;

Nectar robbing, especially by birds,&lt;ref name="Traveset"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Effect of nectar robbing birds on fruit set of Fuchsia magellanica in Tierra Del Fuego: a disrupted mutualism | author=Traveset, A., Willson, M. F.; Sabag, C. | date=1998 | journal=Functional Ecology | volume=12 | pages=459–464 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2435.1998.00212.x | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; can damage the reproductive parts of a flower and thus diminish the fitness of a plant.&lt;ref name="Irwin2003" /&gt; In this case, the effect of robbery on a plant is direct. A good example of an indirect effect is the change in the behaviour of a legitimate pollinator, which either increases or decreases the fitness of a plant. There are both primary and secondary nectar robbers.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt; Secondary robbers are those (e.g. flies and bees) that take advantage of the holes made by primary robbers.&lt;ref name="Traveset" /&gt;

The effect of robbing is positive if the robber also pollinates or increases the pollination by the legitimate pollinator, and negative if the robber damages the reproductive parts of a plant or reduces pollination success, either by competing with the legitimate pollinator or by lessening the attractiveness of the flower.&lt;ref name="Irwin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Irwin R. E.; Brody A. K. | year = 1999 | title = Nectar robbing bumble bees reduce the fitness of Ibomopsis aggregata (Polemoniaceae) | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 80 | issue = 5| pages = 1703–1712 | doi=10.2307/176558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinguishing between a legitimate pollinator and a nectar robber can be difficult.&lt;ref name="Bronstein"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The exploitation of mutualisms | author=Bronstein, J. L. | date=2001 | journal=Ecology Letters | volume=4 | pages=277–287 | doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2001.00218.x | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary implications==
Pollination systems cause [[coevolution]], as in the close relationships between [[Ficus|figs]] and [[fig wasp]]s as well as [[yucca]]s and [[Prodoxidae|yucca moths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pellmyr O., Thompson J.N., Brown J.M., Harrison R.G. | year = 1996 | title = Evolution of pollination and mutualism in the yucca moth lineage | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 148 | issue = 5| pages = 827–847 | doi=10.1086/285958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anstett, M.C.; Hossaert, McKey M.; Kjellberg, F. | year = 1997 | title = Figs and fig pollinators: Evolutionary conflicts in a coevolved mutualism | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 94–99 | doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(96)10064-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; If nectar robbers have an effect (direct or indirect) on a plant or pollinator fitness, they are part of the coevolution process.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt; Where nectar robbing is detrimental to the plant, a plant species might evolve to minimize the traits that attract the robbers or develop some type of protective mechanism to hinder them.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt; Another option is to try to neutralize negative effects of nectar robbers. Nectar robbers are adapted for more efficient nectar robbing: for instance, hummingbirds and ''Diglossa'' flowerpiercers have serrated bills that are thought to aid them in incising flower tissue for nectar robbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ornelas, J. F. | year = 1994 | title = Serrate tomia: An adaptation for nectar robbing in hummingbirds? | journal = The Auk | volume = 111 | issue = 3| pages = 703–713 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nectar robbers may only get food in illegitimate ways because of the mismatch between the morphologies of their mouthparts and the floral structure; or they may rob nectar as a more energy-saving way to get nectar from flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhang Y., Wang Y., Guo Y. | year = 2006 | title = The effects of nectar robbing on plant reproduction and evolution | url = | journal = Zhiwu Shengtai Xuebao | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 695–702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not completely clear how pollination mutualisms persist in the presence of cheating nectar robbers. Nevertheless, as exploitation is not always harmful for the plant, the relationship may be able to endure some cheating. Mutualism may simply confer a higher payoff than nectar robbing.&lt;ref name="Bronstein" /&gt;

==Defences in flowering plants==
Even though there has not been much research on the [[Adaptation|defences]] evolved in plants against nectar robbers, the adaptations have been assumed not  to rise from traits used in interactions between plants and [[herbivore]]s (especially florivores). Some defences may have evolved through traits originally referred to pollination. Defences against nectar robbers have been thought to include [[toxin]]s and [[secondary metabolite|secondary compounds]], escape in time or space, physical barriers and indirect defences.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt;

Toxins and secondary compounds are likely to act as a defence against nectar robbing because they are often found in floral nectar or petal tissue. There is some evidence that secondary compounds in nectar only affect nectar robbers and not the pollinators.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt; One example is a plant called ''[[Catalpa speciosa]]'' which produces nectar containing iridoid [[glycoside]]s that deter nectar-thieving ants but not legitimate bee pollinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stephenson, A. G. |year=1981 |title=Toxic nectar deters nectar thieves of Catalpa speciosa |journal=American Midland Naturalist |volume=105 |pages=381–383 |doi=10.2307/2424757}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low sugar concentration in nectar may also deter nectar robbers without deterring pollinators because dilute nectar does not yield net energy profits for robbers.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt;

If robbers and pollinators forage at different times of day, plants may produce nectar according to the active period of a legitimate pollinator.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt; This is an example of a defence by escaping in time. Another way to use time in defence is to flower only for one day as a tropical [[shrub]] ''[[Pavonia (plant)|Pavonia dasypetala]]'' does to avoid the robbing Trigona bees.&lt;ref name="Roubic" /&gt; Escaping in space refers to a situation in which plant avoids being robbed by growing in a certain location like next to a plant which is more attractive to the robbers.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt;

The last two methods of protection are physical barriers and indirect defence like [[symbiosis|symbionts]]. Tightly packed flowers and unfavourably sized corolla tubes, bract liquid moats and toughness of the corolla or [[sepal]] are barriers for some nectar robbers. A good example of an indirect defence is to attract symbiotic [[predation|predators]] (like ants) by nectar or other rewards to scare away the robbers.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt;

The term 'resistance' refers to the plant's ability to live and reproduce in spite of nectar robbers. This may happen, for example, by compensating the lost nectar by producing more. With the help of defence and resistance, mutualisms can persist even in the presence of cheaters.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt;

'''Nkrumaism''' (sometimes '''Consciencism''') is an [[African socialism|African socialist]] [[List of political ideologies|political ideology]] based on the thinking and writing of [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. Nkrumah, a [[Pan-Africanism|pan-Africanist]] and [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] served as [[Prime Minister of Ghana|Prime Minister]] of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (later [[Ghana]]) from 1952 until 1960 and subsequently as [[President of Ghana]] before being deposed by the [[National Liberation Council]] in 1966.

==Definition==
[[File:Kwame Nkrumah (JFKWHP-AR6409-A).jpg|thumb|[[Kwame Nkrumah]]]]
Nkrumaism is a pan-African [[Socialism|socialist]] theory which aims to adapt Marxist–Leninist theory to the social context of the [[Africa|African continent]]. Nkrumah defined his belief system as "the ideology of a New Africa, independent and absolutely free from [[imperialism]], organized on a continental scale, founded upon the conception of [[United States of Africa|one and united Africa]], drawing its strength from modern science and technology and from the traditional African belief that the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all."{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=31}} The [[Convention People's Party]] (CPP), founded by Nkrumah in 1949, writes "Nkrumaism simply means Self Reliance, African is capable of managing his own affairs. The values CPP stands for or the guiding principles of Nkrumaism today are those which have guided it throughout its existence. Social justice, Pan-Africanism, Self Determination, African Personality, Anti-Imperialism."{{sfn|Convention People's Party|2016}}

Nkrumaism is a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] ideology which blends different sources together while not necessarily borrowing their entire frameworks. In his work, Nkrumah blended different sources from within Africa, the [[Western canon|canon of Western philosophy]], and black intellectuals in North America and Europe, like [[Marcus Garvey]] and [[George Padmore]]. Particularly important in founding this ideology were his study and meetings with [[C.L.R. James]], [[W.E.B. Dubois]], and [[Father Divine]].{{sfn|Simms|2003|p=470}}{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=33}}{{sfn|Rahman|2007|p=73}} Aside from the Marxist–Leninist framework, this blending of ideas largely only took bits and pieces of other philosophical systems and even its use of traditional African cultural concepts were often stretched to fit into the larger theory.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=33}}{{sfn|Rahman|2007|p=59}} While a major focus of the ideology was ending colonial relationships on the African continent, many of the ideas were [[utopia]]n, building from [[Marxism|Marxist]] political theory.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=33}}

==Beliefs==
Like other African political ideologies at the time, the central focus of Nkrumaism was on [[decolonization]] across Africa. The central contention of Nkrumaism was that African countries, united with one another, needed to adopt socialist political structures which were consistent with the traditional African values of [[egalitarianism]]. In Nkrumah's idealized view, pre-colonial African societies did not have individual ownership or class structures, but instead were organized largely around the value of what Nkrumah called "communalism."{{sfn|Biney|2011|p=125}} While colonial structures had damaged these communal, egalitarian values, they had not fully supplanted them. Nkrumism then argued that a return to these values through socialist political structures would both heal the disruption caused by colonial structures and allow further development of African societies.{{sfn|Simms|2003|p=470}} The pan-African aspects of Nkrumah's ideology were justified by a claim that all African societies had largely shared in the communalism prior to colonialism and that in the [[Neocolonialism|neocolonial]] structures that replaced formal colonies, only African unity would create real autonomy.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=34}}

In Nkrumah's argument, four basic pillars formed the applied aspects of this theory: state ownership of the means of production, a [[One-party state|one-party democracy]], fostering a classless economic system, and pan-African unity.{{sfn|Simms|2003|p=470}} While embracing much of Marxist–Leninist philosophy and Soviet political structures at the time, the ideology differed in some key respects. First, while Marxism–Leninism saw revolution as the only way to replace class structures with a socialist egalitarian system, Nkrumah saw reform as the more appropriate case for Africa. He argued that Ghana, and most of the rest of Africa, had never developed the class distinctions which [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] saw in [[Europe]] and thus reform could reestablish preexisting egalitarianism suited to a post-colonial context.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=34}} Nkrumah wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;From the ancestral lines of communalism, the  passage  to  socialism  lies  in  reform,  because  the  underlying  principles  are  the  same.  But  when  this  passage  carries  one  through  colonialism  the  reform  is  revolutionary  since  the  passage  from  colonialism  to  genuine  independence  is  an  act  of  revolution.  But  because  of  the  continuity  of  communalism  with  socialism,  in  communalistic society, socialism is not a revolutionary creed, but a restatement in  contemporary idiom of the principles underlying communalism.{{sfn|Biney|2011|p=125-126}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He would change this idea after the 1966 coup seeing revolution as increasingly necessary.{{sfn|Gyan|1976|p=199}} Second, while Nkrumah believed in the materialism and economic determinism of Marxism, he argued that focusing on the economic system was only appropriate after achieving independence throughout Africa and that the political struggle was the first order in colonial and neocolonial contexts.{{sfn|Gyan|1976|p=214}}

==Impact==
The ideology of Nkrumaism formed a key part of the [[personality cult]] around Nkrumah and the party-building efforts of his political party, the CPP. His arguments were [[Kwame Nkrumah#Works by Kwame Nkrumah|widely published]] and these had an impact within the Gold Coast colony, independent Ghana, and other parts of Africa in the 1950s and 1960s. The CPP, founded by Nkrumah in 1949, became a vocal proponent for the teaching and application of Nkrumaism. When he became president in the 1960s, his Minister for Presidential Affairs, [[Tawia Adamafio]], established study groups on Nkrumahism which many civil servants joined to advance their careers.{{sfn|Omari|1972|p=85}} At the same time, the CPP established Ghana Young Pioneers groups for school age children where Nkrumaism was taught.{{sfn|Austin|1964|p=408}} While the tenets were promoted through these various party efforts, applying all aspects of the ideology proved to be difficult for Nkrumah while President of the country.{{sfn|Smith|1991|p=34}} Because of this, some consider Nkrumaism to be "first of all a cultural phenomenon" in Ghana with little impact on the actual politics of the country.{{sfn|Rahman|2007|p=14}}

==Criticisms==
Henry Bretton argues that Nkrumaism was not a coherent ideology, but a vague framework supporting the cult of personality and the centralized rule of Nkrumah. He writes: "Nkrumaism was a verbalization of the requirements of the personal political machine. Professional scribes and amateurs, along with the Ghanaian Left, were set to the task of providing the coherence and internal consistency required to give a semblance of philosophy to the chaotic assemblage of ideas and fantasies borrowed from all parts of the world and from all periods of history, frequently out of context."{{sfn|Bretton|1964|p=87}}

In contrast, Yuri Smertin criticized early works by Nkrumah from a Marxist perspective for distorting [[scientific socialism]] by combining religious and traditional elements.{{sfn|Agyeman|1988|p=374}}

'''Nyord''' is a [[Denmark|Danish]] island in the [[Baltic Sea]], southeast of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], just north of [[Møn]] island.

Nyord covers an area of approximately 5&amp;nbsp;km², although only 1.2&amp;nbsp;km² is cultivatable [[moraine]], while the remaining 4&amp;nbsp;km² is salt-[[meadow]] which is used for summer grazing, but is flooded during the winter.

The island is reached by a narrow bridge from the larger island of Møn. The bridge was constructed in 1968 and replaced the post boat ''Røret'' which had been in service since 1902. The boat was not large enough for animals such as cattle or horses, which had to swim alongside the boat.

==History==
[[File:Denmark-lolland-falster-moen Islands Bays.png|left|thumb|300px|Nyord (upper right) between Møn &amp; Zealand.]]
Traditionally the island has been self-sufficient, relying upon farming, fishing and piloting. Prior to 1769 the island belonged to the crown, but at this time crown lands were sold off, and the islanders purchased their own island for 3903 rigsdaler. The waters around the island are sufficiently treacherous that islanders could gain a livelihood as pilots, and this became enshrined in law as both a right and duty of the islanders between 1721 and 1879. After 1879 pilots were employed directly by the government instead of earning individual fees. A number of pilots houses and a lookout were constructed  when the government took over the service. Piloting ceased in 1966.

The village of Nyord remains similar to its original design, with traditional thatched cottages and farm houses. It has a church, museum and small harbour. There is a restaurant ''Lolles Gård'' which is both a farm and a restaurant, there also is a village shop. The [[marsh]]land area crossed by the bridge from the main island has one of Denmark's most important habitats for geese, ducks and other wading birds. There is an observation tower for birdwatchers to use.

The '''Petén-Veracruz moist forests''' [[ecoregion]], of the  [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[Biome]], is found in [[Belize]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Mexico]].

==Setting==
The Petén-Veracruz moist forests cover an area of {{convert|149,100|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, extending from central [[Veracruz]] state across portions of the Mexican states of [[Oaxaca]], [[Tabasco]], [[Chiapas]], and [[Campeche]], as well as northern [[Guatemala]] and most of [[Belize]]. The Petén-Veracruz moist forests mostly occupy a coastal lowland with meandering rivers, and includes the [[Lacandon Forest]] of Chiapas and the [[Petén Basin]] of Guatemala.

;Adjacent ecoregions
The ecoregion is bounded on the south by a series of mountain ranges and highlands, including the [[Sierra Madre de Oaxaca]], [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]], [[Chiapas Plateau]], and [[Guatemalan Highlands]], where the lowland Petén-Veracruz forests yield to montane moist forests and pine-oak forests. In central Veracruz, the [[Veracruz dry forests]] separate the Petén-Veracruz moist forests from the [[Veracruz moist forests]] further north. The western portion of the ecoregion mostly extends to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], although the montane forests of the [[Sierra de los Tuxtlas]] and the flooded forests and wetlands of the [[Pantanos de Centla]] constitute distinct ecoregions.

The eastern portion of the ecoregion is bounded on the north by the [[Yucatán moist forests]], which extend east and west across the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. The Petén-Veracruz moist forests extend east to the [[Caribbean Sea]] in Belize, surrounding enclaves of [[Belizean pine forests]] in the [[Maya Mountains]] and near the coast. The [[Belizean Coast mangroves]] run along the Caribbean coast.

==People==
The northern Petén-Veracruz moist forests were home to the [[Olmec]] culture, which built cities between 1200 and 400 BCE. The [[Maya civilization|Classic Maya civilisation]] (250-900 CE) was centered in the eastern and southern portions of the ecoregion, from Tabasco and northern Chiapas across northern Guatemala to Belize.

Today, modern [[Mayan people]] inhabit the eastern portion of the ecoregion, while [[Mixe–Zoque]] and [[Nahuatl]] peoples inhabit the western portion.

==Conservation==
The ecoregion contains a number of protected areas, including the [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] in Guatemala, and the [[Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve]] in Mexico. It is ranked Critical/Endangered by the [[World Wildlife Fund]].

'''PlusEnergy''' is a term used in [[building design]] to describe a structure that produces more energy than it uses. The term was coined in 1994 by [[Rolf Disch]] when building his private residence, the [[Heliotrope (building)|Heliotrope]] as the first PlusEnergy house in the world. Disch then went on to refine the concepts involved with several more projects built by his company  [[Rolf Disch Solar Architecture]] in order to promote PlusEnergy for wider adoption in residential, commercial and retail spaces. Disch maintains that PlusEnergy is more than just a method of producing environmentally-friendly housing, but also an integrated ecological and architectural concept. As such, PlusEnergy is intended to be superior to low-energy or zero-energy designs such as those of [[Passivhaus]]. 

[[File:SoSie+SoSchiff Ansicht.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Solar Settlement]] with the [[Sun Ship (building)|Sun Ship]] in the background: two PlusEnergy projects in [[Freiburg]].]] 

==Technical approach==
The PlusEnergy approach uses a variety of techniques to produce a building that generates more energy than it consumes. A typical example is to capture heat during the day in order to reduce the need to generate heat over night. This is achieved using large North and South facing window areas to allow sunlight to penetrate the structure, reducing the need for energy use from light bulbs. Triple-paned windows ([[U-value]] = 0.7) trap this heat inside, and the addition of heavy insulation then means the structure is already warm in the evening and therefore needs less heating.  In the [[Sun Ship (building)|Sun Ship]], a {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} commercial, retail and residential PlusEnergy structure, techniques such as phase changing materials in the walls and vacuum insulation are also used.  This permits maximum availability of floor space without compromising efficient insulation.

==Social and community aspects==
An important part of the PlusEnergy approach that differentiates it from similar concepts is that the owner or tenant of a PlusEnergy building should be able to live and work comfortably in it without sacrificing lifestyle or normal living standards.  For example, solar panels are made aesthetically pleasing so that they are integrated into the façade of the structure. This reflects PlusEnergy's emphasis on community planning and integration, with aspects of transportation, water management and communication also being seen as part of the design.  

PlusEnergy design also emphasises the importance of [[sustainable development]] on communities in general.  An energy-efficient community is seen as generating positive identification and community pride. Rolf Disch says he attracts a high quality of tenant, innovative undertakings and creative work places through his designs. Ecological urban planning techniques like traffic management with wide, attractive walkways, bicycle routes and connections to public transportation are all part of the PlusEnergy ideal.  At the [[Solar Settlement]] for example, tenants and owners incorporate bicycle and car-sharing, and the neighborhood has an extensive car-free zone with many public transportation connections.

==Example projects==

===Heliotrope===
Built in 1994 as the private residence and special project of [[Rolf Disch]] in [[Freiburg]], the [[Heliotrope (building)|Heliotrope]] is claimed by its designer to be the first building in the world to create more energy than it uses, being reliant on entirely renewable power, and being emissions free and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; neutral. The structure rotates to track the sun, which allows it to use a large amount of natural sunlight and warmth during the day.  Several different energy generation technologies are used in the building, including a {{convert|603|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} [[solar tracker|dual-axis solar photovoltaic tracking panel]], a [[geothermal heat pump|geothermal heat exchanger]], a [[cogeneration|combined heat and power unit (CHP)]] and [[solar thermal energy|solar-thermal]] balcony railing to provide heat and warm water.  These in combination with the large amounts of insulation allow the Heliotrope to produce between four and six times its energy usage depending on the time of year.  The building is also fitted with a [[greywater|grey-water cleansing system]] and built-in waste composting.

After the success of Freiburg’s Heliotrope, [[Hansgrohe]] contracted [[Rolf Disch Solar Architecture]] to design and built another Heliotrope to be used as a visitors' center and showroom in [[Offenburg]], Germany.  A third Heliotrope was then built in [[Hilpoltstein]], [[Bavaria]] to be used as a technical dental laboratory.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Solar Settlement===
{{Main|Solar Settlement}}
With the success of the Heliotrope, [[Rolf Disch Solar Architecture]] applied their PlusEnergy concept to mass residential production in the form of a community development of 50 PlusEnergy houses.  The project, called [[Solar Settlement]], won 2002 House of the Year, 2002 Residential PV Solar Integration Award, and Germany’s Most Beautiful Housing Community,  2006.  Built between 2000 and 2005 in the [[Vauban, Freiburg|Vauban]] quarter of [[Freiburg]], the Solar Settlement is intended as an example of Disch’s vision of a “fundamental environmental imperative”. As of 2011, the homes have had more than 8 years of full occupancy and each produced more than 5,000 Euros ($5,600) of surplus energy a year, from which the owners of the houses have benefitted.

Made from [[Black Forest]] timber, the wood interior and natural lighting provide for happily lit spaces and a natural flow from room to room. The tenants at the Solar Settlement claim not to have made any compromises in their living standards, and that they have benefitted environmentally and economically.

===Sun Ship===
{{Main|Sun Ship (building)}}
The Sun Ship, located next to the [[Solar Settlement]] in Freiburg, uses its {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} for retail, commercial and residential space.  The Sun Ship houses a supermarket, convenience store and café on the first floor, offices and work spaces on the 2nd and 4th floors, and 9 penthouses on its roof.  Notable aspects of the building are its vacuum insulated walls, ventilation with 95% heat recovery, triple paned windows, and solar-panelled façade.

As the first positive energy office building worldwide, the Sun Ship exhibits not only high energy efficiency but also a pleasant environment to work in.  The office spaces are flanked on both the North and South ends entirely with windows, which captures natural sunlight and minimizes the energy wasted by artificial light. In addition to the office and retail space, two conference rooms provide space for lectures, meetings and as a showroom.

'''''Ptaeroxylon obliquum''''' is the botanical name for the '''sneezewood tree'''. It is native to [[Southern Africa]], including [[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Mozambique]]. It is the only species in the genus '''''Ptaeroxylon'''''.

== Background ==
''Ptaeroxylon obliquum'' is a species from the Rutaceae family which are most abundant in South Africa and Australia.&lt;ref name="CEE 2009"/&gt; The term ''ptaeroxylon'' is Greek for sneeze and wood,&lt;ref name="Plantz Afrika"/&gt; while ''obliquum'' denotes the oblique shape of the leaflets. The wood produces oils containing [[nieshoutol]], which causes violent [[sneeze]] attacks by workers who are exposed to the tree.&lt;ref name="Plantz Afrika"/&gt; Though sneezewood is not [[poisonous]], it has been known to cause respiratory complications. It has been linked to [[asthma]], [[rhinitis]] and mucosal inflammation.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2000"/&gt;

== Description ==
[[image:Ptaeroxylon obliquum, stam en lower, Manie van der Schijff BT.jpg|thumb|left|200px|foliage]]
[[image:Ptaeroxylon obliquum, blomme, Manie van der Schijff BT, c.jpg|thumb|left|200px|male flowers]]
''Ptaeroxylon obliquum'' is a shrub or medium deciduous tree that stands up to {{convert|15|m|ft}} tall.&lt;ref name="Roux 2003"/&gt;
The bark is whitish-grey and smooth when young, but fissured with age. Leaflets are 2.5 x 1.3&amp;nbsp;cm marked asymmetrically. They are blue-green to dark green in color and crowd near the ends of the rachis in three to seven pairs of leaflets. The flowers on the tree are white to creamy yellow and fragrant.&lt;ref name="Flora... 2009"/&gt;

Sneezewood is very dense having a [[specific gravity]] of 1040&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

== Uses ==

===Lumber===
Sneezewood is an extremely hard and durable [[timber]] wood. It often lasts longer than [[brass]] or [[iron]] when used for machine [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s.&lt;ref name="Roux 2003"/&gt;

In the past, sneezewood was used extensively for [[Railroad tie|railway sleepers]]. It can also be used to make [[furniture]]. In [[Mozambique]] it is used to make [[xylophone]] keys.&lt;ref name="Plantz Afrika"/&gt;

Sneezewood is a very attractive wood with golden [[heartwood]] with light orange figures and is a favorite amongst [[woodturning|woodturners]].

Its scarcity today is due in part of its past use as [[fuel]] for [[steamboat|steam]] [[tugboat|tug]]s.&lt;ref name="Plantz Afrika"/&gt;
It has been used extensively for [[fence]] and [[telegraph pole]]s as well.&lt;ref name="Roux 2003"/&gt;

===Medicinal===
Sneezewood is used for medicinal and ritual purposes. The bark can be used to repel moths or as snuff. The resin has been used to get rid of warts and cattle ticks.&lt;ref name="Plantz Afrika"/&gt;

The [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] have traditionally made [[snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] from sneeze-wood to relieve [[headaches]].&lt;ref name="Schirmer 1980"/&gt;

A '''pyroclastic flow''' (also known as a '''pyroclastic density current''' or a '''pyroclastic cloud''')&lt;ref&gt;Branney M.J. &amp; Kokelaar, B.P. 2002, Pyroclastic Density Currents and the Sedimentation of Ignimbrites. Geological Society of London Memoir 27, 143pp.&lt;/ref&gt; is a fast-moving current of hot [[volcanic gas|gas]] and volcanic matter (collectively known as [[tephra]]) that moves away from a volcano about {{convert|100|kph|abbr=on}} on average but is capable of reaching speeds up to {{convert|700|kph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/msh//pyroclastic.html Pyroclastic flows USGS]&lt;/ref&gt; The gases can reach temperatures of about {{convert|1000|C}}.

Pyroclastic flows are a common and devastating result of certain [[explosive eruptions]]; they normally touch the ground and hurtle downhill, or spread laterally under gravity. Their speed depends upon the density of the current, the volcanic output rate, and the gradient of the slope.

==Origin of term==
[[File:BishopTuff.jpg|thumb|Rocks from the [[Bishop tuff]], uncompressed with [[pumice]] (on left); compressed with [[fiamme]] (on right).]]
The word ''pyroclast'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:πῦρ|πῦρ]]}}, meaning "fire", and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:κλαστός|κλαστός]]}}, meaning "broken in pieces".&lt;ref&gt;See:

A word is wanting to express all such accompaniments, no matter what their size or condition may be, when they are accumulated in such mass as to form beds of "rock." We might call them perhaps "pyroclastic materials," … "

(Shortly after the eruption of what I will call henceforth the ''dense, glowing cloud'' [''nuée ardente''], an immense cloud of cinders covered the entire island, sprinkling it with a thin layer of volcanic debris.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Although the coining of the term nuée ardente in 1904 is attributed to the French geologist [[Alfred Lacroix|Antoine Lacroix]], according to:

the term was used in 1873 by Lacroix's father-in-law and former professor, French geologist [[Ferdinand André Fouqué]] in his description of the 1580 and 1808 eruptions of the volcano on the island of [[São Jorge Island|São Jorge]] in the [[Azores]].

(One of the strangest phenomena of this great eruption is the production of what contemporary witnesses called ''nuées ardentes''.)

Marjorie Hooker – (Hooker, 1965), p. 405 – records that Father João Inácio da Silveira (1767–1852) from the village of Santo Amaro on São Jorge island wrote an account of the 1808 eruption in which he decribed an ''ardente nuven'' ("burning cloud" in Portuguese) that flowed down the slopes of the volcano. Silveira's account was published in 1871 and republished in 1883.

Pyroclastic flows that contain a much higher proportion of gas to rock are known as "fully dilute pyroclastic density currents" or [[pyroclastic surge]]s. The lower density sometimes allows them to flow over higher topographic features or water such as ridges, hills, rivers and seas. They may also contain steam, water and rock at less than {{convert|250|C|F}}; these are called "cold" compared with other flows, although the temperature is still lethally high. Cold pyroclastic surges can occur when the eruption is from a vent under a shallow lake or the sea. Fronts of some pyroclastic density currents are fully dilute; for example, during the eruption of [[Mount Pelée]] in 1902, a fully dilute current overwhelmed the city of [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|Saint-Pierre]] and killed nearly 30,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur N. Strahler (1972), ''Planet Earth: its physical systems through geological time''&lt;/ref&gt;

A pyroclastic flow is a type of [[gravity current]]; in scientific literature they are sometimes abbreviated to PDC (pyroclastic density current).

== Causes ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
There are several mechanisms that can produce a pyroclastic flow:

* ''Fountain collapse'' of an [[eruption column]] from a [[Plinian eruption]] (e.g. [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|Mount Vesuvius' destruction of Herculaneum and Pompeii]]). In such an eruption, the material forcefully ejected from the vent heats the surrounding air and the turbulent mixture rises, through [[convection]], for many kilometers. If the erupted jet is unable to heat the surrounding air sufficiently, convection currents will not be strong enough to carry the plume upwards and it falls, flowing down the flanks of the volcano.
* ''Fountain collapse'' of an [[eruption column]] associated with a [[Vulcanian eruption]] (e.g., Montserrat's [[Soufrière Hills]] volcano has generated many of these deadly pyroclastic flows and surges). The gas and projectiles create a cloud that is denser than the surrounding air and becomes a pyroclastic flow.
* Frothing at the mouth of the vent during degassing of the erupted lava. This can lead to the production of a rock called [[ignimbrite]]. This occurred during the eruption of [[Novarupta]] in 1912.
* Gravitational collapse of a [[lava dome]] or spine, with subsequent avalanches and flows down a steep slope (e.g., Montserrat's [[Soufrière Hills]] volcano, which caused nineteen deaths in 1997).
* The [[Lateral eruption|directional blast]] (or jet) when part of a volcano collapses or explodes (e.g., the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|eruption of Mount St. Helens in May 18, 1980]]). As distance from the volcano increases, this rapidly transforms into a gravity-driven current.

== Size and effects ==

[[File:PyroclasticFlow.jpg|thumb|Building remnant in Francisco Leon destroyed by pyroclastic surges and flows during eruption of El Chichon volcano in Mexico 1982. Reinforcement rods in concrete bent in the direction of the flow.]]
[[Image:Pyroclastic Flow St. Helens.jpg|thumb|A scientist examines pumice blocks at the edge of a pyroclastic flow deposit from [[Mount St. Helens]]]]
The volumes range from a few hundred cubic meters to more than 1,000 cubic kilometres. The larger ones can travel for hundreds of kilometres, although none on that scale have occurred for several hundred thousand years. Most pyroclastic flows are around 1 to 10 cubic kilometres and travel for several kilometres. Flows usually consist of two parts: the ''basal flow'' hugs the ground and contains larger, coarse boulders and rock fragments, while an extremely hot [[ash plume]] lofts above it because of the turbulence between the flow and the overlying air, admixing and heating cold atmospheric air causing expansion and convection.&lt;ref&gt;Myers and Brantley (1995). Volcano Hazards Fact Sheet: Hazardous Phenomena at Volcanoes, USGS Open File Report 95-231&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[kinetic energy]] of the moving cloud will flatten trees and buildings in its path. The hot gases and high speed make them particularly lethal, as they will incinerate living organisms instantaneously: 
* The cities of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], Italy, for example, were engulfed by pyroclastic surges on August 24, 79 AD with many lives lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weller |first=Roger |title=Mount Vesuvius, Italy. |publisher=Cochise College Department of Geology |year=2005 |accessdate=15 October 2010 |url=http://skywalker.cochise.edu/wellerr/students/mount-vesuvius2/vesuvius.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023185623/http://skywalker.cochise.edu/wellerr/students/mount-vesuvius2/vesuvius.htm |archive-date=23 October 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1902 eruption of [[Mount Pelée]] destroyed the [[Martinique]] town of [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|St. Pierre]]. Despite signs of impending eruption, the government deemed St. Pierre safe due to hills and valleys between it and the volcano, but the pyroclastic flow charred almost the entirety of the city, killing all but two of its 30,000 residents.
* A pyroclastic surge killed [[volcanology|volcanologists]] [[Harry Glicken]] and [[Katia and Maurice Krafft]] and 40 other people on [[Mount Unzen]], in Japan, on June 3, 1991. The surge started as a pyroclastic flow and the more energised surge climbed a spur on which the Kraffts and the others were standing; it engulfed them, and the corpses were covered with about 5&amp;nbsp;mm of ash.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, Lin. Reader’s Digest Pathfinders Earthquakes and Volcanoes. New York: Weldon Owen Publishing, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 25 June, 1997 a pyroclastic flow travelled down Mosquito Ghaut on the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Montserrat]]. A large, highly energized pyroclastic surge developed. This flow could not be restrained by the Ghaut and spilled out of it, killing 19 people who were in the Streatham village area (which was officially evacuated). Several others in the area suffered severe burns.

During some phases of the Soufriere Hills volcano on Montserrat, pyroclastic flows were filmed about 1&amp;nbsp;km offshore. These show the water boiling as the flow passed over it. The flows eventually built a delta, which covered about 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

A pyroclastic flow can interact with a body of water to form a large amount of mud, which can then continue to flow downhill as a [[lahar]]. This is one of several mechanisms that can create a lahar.

===On the Moon===
In 1963, NASA astronomer Winifred Cameron proposed that the lunar equivalent of terrestrial pyroclastic flows may have formed sinuous [[rille]]s on the [[Moon]]. In a lunar volcanic eruption, a pyroclastic cloud would follow local relief, resulting in an often sinuous track. The Moon's [[Schroter's Valley|Schröter's Valley]] offers one example.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Torfmoos Schwingdecke.jpg|thumb|[[Peat moss]] [[floating mat]] on a silted-up [[raised bog kolk]]]]
'''Raised bogs''', also called '''ombrotrophic bogs''' (''ombrotrophe Moore''), are acidic, wet habitats that are poor in mineral salts and are home to [[flora]] and [[fauna]] that can cope with such extreme conditions. Raised bogs, unlike [[fen]]s are exclusively fed by precipitation ([[ombrotrophy]]) and from mineral salts introduced from the air. They thus represent a special type of [[bog]], [[hydrologically]], [[ecologically]] and in terms of their development history, in which the growth of [[peat moss]]es over centuries or millennia plays a decisive role. They also differ in character from [[blanket bog]]s which are much thinner and occur in wetter, cloudier climatic zones.&lt;ref&gt;Whittow, John (1984). ''Dictionary of Physical Geography''. London: Penguin, 1984, p. 438. {{ISBN|0-14-051094-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raised bogs are very threatened by [[peat cutting]] and pollution by mineral salts from the surrounding land (due to [[agriculture]] and [[industry]]). There are hardly any raised bogs today that are still living and growing. The last great raised bog regions are found in western [[Siberia]] and [[Canada]].

== Terminology ==
The term raised bog derives from the fact that this type of bog rises in height over time as a result of peat formation. They are like sponges of peat moss, full of water, than form a more or less dome shape in the landscape. In Germany, the term ''Hochmoor'' ("high bog"), strictly refers only to the classical, lens-shaped bogs of northwest Germany. The bogs are not influenced by mineral-rich groundwater or surface water, but are fed exclusively by precipitation - mainly rainwater, hence their alternative German designation of ''Regenmoor'' or "rain-fed bog". Thus the latter refers to all bogs that are not arched or only slightly arched, but which nevertheless are characterized by an extreme mineral salt deficiency and other resulting ecological properties.

== Formation and development ==
[[File:Huvenhoops Moorschichtung.jpg|thumb|left|Layering of a raised bog: plant remains, white peat and black peat (from the top)]] 
&lt;!-- [[File:entstehung HM.gif|thumb|Growth of a 'classic' raised bog in Northwest Germany]]needs review before transfer to Commons --&gt;
A living raised bog needs a moist, balanced [[climate]] in which to grow. The quantity of precipitation has to be greater than the water losses through [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] and evaporation. In addition, the precipitation must be evenly spread through the year.

Raised bogs in Europe have been developing for about 11,000 years, since the beginning of the [[Holocene]] and after the retreat of the last [[Weichselian glaciation|ice sheet]]. As far as their origins are concerned, a distinction is made between lake mires or 'siltation-formed raised bogs' (''Verlandungshochmoore'') and 'mire-formed raised bogs' (''wurzelechte Hochmoore''). The former emerged in a secondary process after the [[silting up]] of [[lakes]] or [[oxbow lake|oxbow]]s (see illustration on the right in the sequence). At first, [[fen]]s emerged under the influence of [[groundwater]] ([[minerotrophy]]). Oxygen deficiencies and high [[acidity]] in the constantly moist substrate inhibited the decomposition of dead plant parts and led to [[peat]] formation.

Thus the raised bog rises very slowly above the level of the [[groundwater]] level, hence its name. As the resulting peat slowly rises above the influence of mineral salts in the groundwater, it reaches a point where the development of the raised bog begins to change in nature; that is, the bog now becomes fed solely by rainwater, which is low in salt water. By contrast, mire-formed raised bogs, are created directly on the mineral substrate of in low-salt area without having been initially formed as fens (see figure on the left in the sequence). They are formed either as a primary bog due to the erosion of previously dry mineral soils, for example due to clearing, climate change or infiltration, or as a secondary process as a result of the growth of a raised bog on neighbouring mineral soil. The formation of a typical raised bog is a very slow process, which lasts from centuries to a thousand years even in favourable, undisturbed conditions. Furthermore, there are a number of [[intermediate bog|transitional and intermediate bogs]], which in different ways combine characteristics of both raised bogs and fens. (see [[bog]]).

The main constituent of the peat are the rootless peat mosses, that only slowly grow in height, whilst at the same time the lower layer becomes peat as the air is excluded. Depending on the geographical location, various species of peat moss are involved in making the raised bogs. The growth rate of the peat layer is only about a millimetre per year.

[[File:Akrotelm Katotelm.png|thumb|left|Structure of a growing bog]]
Growing bogs can be divided into two layers. The 'acrotelm' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''akros'' = highest; ''telma'' = bog) is the upper part and includes the vegetation layer and the bog 'floor'. Here fresh organic substances (peat formation horizon) are created by the growth and dying of plant elements. The "catotelm" (Greek: kato = below) is the underlying water-saturated part with less biological activity. This layer is counted as a geological subsoil due to the small earth-forming processes that are still going on and is known as the peat preservation horizon (''Torferhaltungshorizont''). In raised bogs, the upper peat layer is called white peat, since it consists of largely undecomposed light brown peat mosses. The lower layer is black peat, which is already well [[humus|humified]] and has a black-brown colour with still recognizable plant remains.
&lt;div style="clear:left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Types and distribution ==
&lt;!--[[File:Moorverbreitung Regenmoore.png|thumb|Worldwide distribution of bogs as well as raised bogs dominated by peat mosses]]  needs review before transfer to Commons --&gt;
The formation of raised bogs is dependent on the climate, that is to say the amount of precipitation and rate of evaporation, which in turn are decisively determined by the temperature. In addition, the relief of the terrain has an influence on the water discharge behaviour and thus the shape of a raised bog. This results in geographical limitations to the formation of raised bogs. Favourable conditions for the development of raised bogs are found mainly in North America ([[Canada]] and [[Alaska]]), [[Northern Europe]] and [[Western Siberia]], [[South America]], [[Southeast Asia]] and in the [[Amazon Basin]]. In these regions, bogs of all kinds and peat deposits of four million square kilometres have been formed, covering three percent of the earth's surface. In the southern hemisphere low-mineral-rich bogs are rarely formed from peat mosses. Only in the [[Tierra del Fuego]] do peat moss raised bogs exist. The most peaty countries in the tropics are found in Southeast Asia. In many cases it is not yet clear how these bogs have emerged as mosses are entirely absent here.
&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Coastal bogs ===
Coastal bogs (''Planregenmoore'') or Atlantic bogs, as their names suggest, tend to form close to the sea. In addition, in regions covered by blanket bog, there are also lightly convex coastal bogs with low energy surface relief in level locations. The distribution of coastal bogs in Europe extends from Ireland to the east via South [[Norway]] to Southwest [[Sweden]] and north to the [[Lofoten]]. In North America there are coastal bogs in the area of the [[Great Lakes]] (especially in [[Minnesota]] and [[Ontario]]). Coastal bogs are also fed exclusively by the rain.

=== Plateau bogs ===
In the less oceanically influenced climatic regions of North-West Europe (lower precipitation), the raised bogs take on the classical lens shape and are called plateau bogs or plateau raised bogs (''Plateauregenmoore''). They grow more strongly in the centre than at the margins. This results in the centre of the bog bulging, hence the name "raised bog". This bulging can be several metres high. As a result, the perimeter of the bog is more or less inclined, and is known as the ''rand''. The sloping bog sides of larger bogs are traversed by drainage channels or soaks (''Rüllen'') through which the excess water is discharged.

Other characteristic structures of these raised bogs are the flat, treeless raised bog core with its characteristic microrelief of shallow wet depressions or [[flark]]s (''Schlenken'') alternating with hummocks (''Bülten'') of drier peat moss. Larger accumulations of water in the middle of the bogs are called kolks or [[bog pond]]s (of [[humic acid]]-rich water); the wet area on the outer margins is known as a moat or ''[[Lagg (landform)|lagg]]''.

Genuine ombrotrophic bogs on the [[North German Plain]] are usually sharply divided into two layers: an underlying black peat layer, which is strongly decomposed, and an overlying white peat layer which is less decomposed. This difference is a result of changes in the [[hydrology]] of the bog. The white peat grew more rapidly under humid conditions than the black peat. This is attributed to a climate change with high precipitation and low evaporation around 1000 to 500 BC. As a result, the peat moss growth grew locally and the black peat/white peat boundary layer was formed, although this did not develop simultaneously in all raised bogs.

=== Mountain or upland bogs ===
Raised bogs also occur in precipitation-rich upland regions at the [[Altitudinal zonation#Elevation levels|montane]] and, more rarely, [[Altitudinal zonation#Elevation levels|alpine]] levels (i.e. above the [[tree line]]). As a result of the sloping terrain, they often have a characteristic, asymmetric or non-concentric appearance. Mountain or upland bogs may be topographically divided into:&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Steiner: ''Moortypen''. In: ''Stapfia'' 85, zugleich ''Kataloge der OÖ. Landesmuseen'', Neue Serie 35, 2005, Abschnitt ''Hochmoore, Regenmoore – vom Niederschlagswasser gespeiste Moore'', pp. 14 ff., [http://www.landesmuseum.at/pdf_frei_remote/STAPFIA_0085_0005-0026.pdf pp. 5–26] (pdf) landesmuseum.at&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plateau bogs on level ground
* Hillside bogs – bogs on hillsides which are not genuine percolating mires (''Durchströmungsmoore''); the upper parts of the bog are more strongly fed by incoming water and are usually flat. The lower parts are exclusively fed by rainwater and may be of considerable thickness. The lower rand is often very steep and there is usually no typical wet zone or lagg (see above). Kolks, shallow pondlets (''Blänken'') and soaks occur as in classic raised bogs.
* Saddle bogs – usually elongated bogs on [[mountain pass]]es, which are partly fed by water from the flanking hillsides, are rare; their margins resemble hillside bogs, the central area is more like a plateau bog
* Summit and crest bogs – very rare
All these bog types may occur on the margins of [[lowland bog]]s i.e. [[fen]]s, or transition into them.

=== Kermi bogs ===
Kermi bogs (''Kermimoore, Schildhochmoore, Strangmoore'' or ''Blankenmoore'') or kermi raised bogs have only a slightly domed shape. The surface of the bog rises steadily from the broad [[Lagg (landform)|lagg]] zone. Kermis have ridge-shaped hummocks of peat moss, that are aligned with the contours of the bog. The [[flark]]s or elongated depressions are generally tub-shaped and hardly distinguishable externally from [[kolk (bog)|kolks]]. In the central area of these bogs, there are always large kolks. In northern [[Russia]] and western Sibiria, kermis frequently occur in giant complexes where the bogs have grown into one another. Kermis are also found in [[Finland]] in the central and northern [[boreal forest]] zone.

String bogs or aapa fens (''Aapamoore'' or ''Strangmoore'') are typically found on the northern fringes of the distribution area for raised bogs, in the sub-polar zone, north of the 66th latitude in the northern hemisphere. Here, raised bogs only occur as islands within wetlands supplied by mineral soil water. On level ground these islands are irregularly distributed; on hillsides they form ridges parallel to the contours and at right angles to line of slope. The ridges separate boggy hollows of mineral soil known by the Finnish word, ''rimpis''. The main distribution area for string bogs are the Scandinavian hills, central Finland, [[Karelia]] and north Sibiria. In North America, Alaska is the main location for string bogs, thanks to its cold continental climate. Frost action plays an important role in these bogs. On the ridges or hummocks, ground ice is found until early summer.

=== Palsas ===
{{main|Palsa}}
[[Palsa]] bogs (''Palsamoore'' or ''Palsenmoore'') are found on the margins of the Arctic [[permafrost]] soils ([[tundra]]). Here the ridges of the string bogs can grow into hummocks several metres high. Like string bogs, the so-called [[palsa]]s frequently lie within peatlands fed by mineral soil water. Some are surrounded by water-filled, ditch-like hollows. Peat formation is limited; these bogs are peat deposits from warmer, [[interglacial]] periods and did not experience [[frost heaving]] of their inner core of ice until the climate became colder. These [[ice lens]]es increase in size from year to year as a result of [[freeze-thaw]] processes of the surrounding water. The low temperatures prevent full decomposition of the organic material.
&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Polygonal bogs ===
[[File:Permafrost - polygon.jpg|thumb|A polygonal bog comprising flat ponds with the characteristic polygonal structure]]
Polygonal bogs (''Polygonmoore'') are widespread on the Arctic and sub-Arctic plains of Sibiria and North Americas and cover vast areas. They are associated with [[patterned peatland]] and [[ice wedge]]s. A scanty layer of peat-forming vegetation can occur in the inner honeycomb-shaped areas of this frost pattern terrain ([[cryoturbation]]) and are fed during the short summers with sufficient moisture, because the meltwater is prevented from draining away by the raised polygonal margins. The peat layers can attain a thickness of {{convert|0.3|to(-)|1|m|ft|abbr=on|1}}.
&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Distribution in the Northern Hemisphere ==
=== Asia ===
The west Siberian raised bog area covers {{convert|700000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. The large bogs have domes in the centre up to {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. They are predominantly of the kermi bog type. They represent probably the most important type of raised bog on earth. The [[Vasyugan Swamp]] in this region, is the largest bog system on earth and covers more than {{convert|50000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. It is estimated to contain over 14 billion tonnes of peat deposits.

[[File:Wildsee-pjt2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A raised bog kolk, the [[Wildsee (Kaltenbronn)|Wildsee]], near [[Bad Wildbad]] in the [[Black Forest]]]]
=== Europe ===
The largest central European raised bog areas are the southern [[North Sea]] coastal area and the [[Alpine Foreland]]. As in North America there is a succession of raised bog types along the line of descent towards the ocean, from northwest to southeast. As a result of peat use, raised bogs have been harvested for peat and cultivated, apart from a few remnants (less than 10% of the original area). The largest contiguous raised bog in central Europe was the [[Bourtange Moor]], which originally covered an area of about  2,300&amp;nbsp;km² including the Dutch portion, but only small sections remain. The largest remaining raised bog in northern Europe is the 76 km² [[Lille Vildmose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Naturturist | date=16 November 2015 | title=Lille Vildmose | url=http://www.naturturist.dk/lillevildmose/mosen.htm | language=Danish | accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other large raised bogs are the [[Teufelsmoor]] northeast of Bremen, the [[Vehnemoor]] (exhausted) and the [[Esterweger Dose]] (formerly about 80&amp;nbsp;km², exhausted) between Oldenburg and Papenburg. The raised bogs of the [[Central Uplands]] of the [[Harz]], [[Solling]], [[Thuringian Forest]] ([[Großer Beerberg]], [[Schneekopf]] - Teufelsbad, Fichtenkopf, Saukopf), [[Giant Mountains]], [[Ore Mountains]], [[Fichtel]] and [[Rhön]] ([[Black Moor (bog)|Black Moor]], [[Red Moor (Rhön)|Red Moor]]) are, by contract, comparatively small. In the [[Black Forest]] the [[Wildsee (Wildbad)|Wildseemoor]] has been protected and, in the [[Vosges]] on ''le Tanet'', north of the [[Col de la Schlucht]] a large area has been protected. The [[Alpine Foreland]], which was formed by ice-age glaciation, is also rich in peatland. The [[Wurzacher Ried]] (Haidgauer Regenmoorschild) is considered the largest and best preserved raised bog in central Europe. Other raised bogs and [[peatland]] areas include the [[Federsee]], the [[High Fens]] on the Germano-Belgian border, the [[Ewiges Meer]] near Aurich and the [[Lengener Meer]] near Wiesmoor. The last [[Baltic region|Baltic]] raised bogs have now been exhausted. In 2003, [[Estonia]] exported 3.6 million&amp;nbsp;m³ of peat for west European garden use, more than 60% of the state production. In [[Lithuania]] 60% of the usable peat area has been prepared for extraction or is already exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;O. Bragg, R. Lindsay: ''Strategy and Action Plan for Mire and Peatland Conservation in Central Europe.'' Wetlands International, Wageningen, 2003. {{ISBN|90-5882-018-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ireland ====
Lough Lurgeen Bog and Glenamaddy Turlough Bog contains very good examples of the [[Habitats Directive|Annex 1 habitats]]: active raised bog, turlough (both priority habitats), degraded raised bog (capable of regeneration) and vegetation of depressions (rhynchosporion). These habitats are considered to be among the best examples in Ireland due to their relatively large size and the generally low levels of disturbance. In the Natura form compiled for the site active raised bog was given a rating of A (Excellent value) which emphasises the importance of the site. Raised bog habitats are now very rare in Europe and it has recently been estimated that the Republic of Ireland contains 50% of the relatively intact oceanic raised bog systems in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;O’ Connell, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site contains the second largest area of intact raised bog surface in Ireland. The combination of raised bog, oligotrophic lake and turlough habitats is unique in Ireland and thus the entire system is very important from both a hydrological and ecological perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Restoring Raised Bog in Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North America ===
A region of peatland extends from Alaska in the west to the coast of the Atlantic in the east, and is comparable in size to that of West Siberia. A zone of domed raised bogs adjoins the zones of palsa bogs and string fens. In the direction of descent towards the ocean, blanket bogs occur east of Hudson Bay. These are superseded towards the west by plateau bogs in the area of the large lakes and, eventually, by kermi bogs.

'''Rhyolite''' is an [[igneous rock|igneous]], [[volcanic rock]], of [[felsic]] ([[silica]]-rich) composition (typically &gt; 69% SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – see the [[TAS classification]]). It may have any texture from [[glassy]] to [[aphanitic]] to [[porphyritic]]. The [[mineral]] assemblage is usually [[quartz]], [[sanidine]] and [[plagioclase]] (in a ratio &gt; 2:1 – see the [[QAPF diagram]]). [[Biotite]] and [[hornblende]] are common accessory minerals. It is the [[extrusive]] equivalent  to [[granite]].

==Geology==
Rhyolite can be considered as the extrusive equivalent to the [[plutonic]] granite rock, and consequently, outcrops of rhyolite may bear a resemblance to granite. Due to their high content of silica and low [[iron]] and [[magnesium]] contents, rhyolite melts are highly polymerized and form highly viscous [[lava]]s. They also occur as [[breccia]]s or in [[volcanic plug]]s and [[dike (geology)|dikes]]. Rhyolites that cool too quickly to grow [[crystals]] form a natural glass or vitrophyre, also called [[obsidian]]. Slower cooling forms microscopic crystals in the lava and results in textures such as flow [[foliation (geology)|foliations]], [[spherulite|spherulitic]], [[Nodule (geology)|nodular]], and [[lithophysa]]l structures. Some rhyolite is highly [[Vesicular texture|vesicular]] [[pumice]]. Many eruptions of rhyolite are highly explosive and the deposits may consist of fallout [[tephra]]/[[tuff]] or of [[ignimbrite]]s.

Eruptions of rhyolite are relatively rare compared to eruptions of less felsic lavas. Only three eruptions of rhyolite have been recorded since the start of the 20th century: at the [[St. Andrew Strait]] volcano in [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Novarupta]] volcano in [[Alaska]], and [[Chaiten]] in southern [[Chile]].

== Occurrence ==
Rhyolite has been found on islands far from land, but such oceanic occurrences are rare.&lt;ref name=Farndon&gt;The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rocks of the World by John Farndon, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1821">{{short description|A narrow eastward ocean current in the central North Pacific Ocean}}
The '''subtropical countercurrent''' ('''STCC''') is a narrow eastward [[ocean current]] in the central [[North Pacific Ocean]] (20–30°N) where the [[Sverdrup theory]] predicts a broad westward flow. It originates in the western North Pacific around 20°N, and flows eastward against the northeast [[trade winds]] and stretches northeastward to the north of [[Hawaii]].

It is accompanied by a subsurface temperature and density front called the [[subtropical front]], in thermal wind relation with the STCC. Furthermore, the STCC maintains a sea surface temperature front during winter and spring. During April and May when the SST front is still strong, the seasonal warming makes the region conductive to atmospheric convection, and surface wind stress curls turn weakly positive along the front on the background of negative curls that drive the subtropical [[gyre]].

On the weather timescale, positive wind curls are related to low-pressure systems of a subsynoptic scale in space, energized by surface baroclinicity and latent heat release along the STF front. The SST front also anchors a meridional maximum in column-integrated water vapor, indicating a deep structure of the atmosphere response.

'''Tare weight''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɛər}}, sometimes called '''[[unladen weight]]''', is the weight of an empty vehicle or container.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By subtracting it from the [[gross weight]] ([[laden weight]]), the weight of the goods carried (the [[net weight]]) may be determined.  This can be useful in computing the cost of the goods carried for purposes of [[tax]]ation or for [[Fee|tolls]] related to barge, rail, road, or other traffic, especially where the toll will vary with the value of the goods carried (''e.g.'', tolls on the [[Erie Canal]]). Tare weight is often published upon the sides of [[railway car]]s and transport vehicles to facilitate the computation of the load carried. Tare weight is also used in body composition assessment when doing underwater weighing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The word ''[[wikt:tare#Etymology 2|tare]]'' originates from the [[Middle French]] word {{lang|frm|tare}} “wastage in goods, deficiency, imperfection” (15th {{abbr|c.|century}}), from [[Italy|Italian]] {{lang|it|tara}}, from [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|طرح}} {{transl|ar|ṭarḥ}}, lit. “thing deducted or rejected”, from {{transl|ar|taraha}} “to reject”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tare |title=tare (2) |work=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tare weight is accounted for in kitchen scales, [[analytical scale|analytical]] (scientific) and other [[weighing scale]]s which include a button that resets the zero of the scale display when an empty container is placed on the weighing platform, in order to subsequently display only the weight of the contents of the container.

Gross weight (the total weight) = net weight (the weight of the goods) + tare weight (the weight of the empty container).

'''University High School''', commonly known as "Uni", is a public secondary school, built 1923-1924, and founded 1924, located in [[West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California|West Los Angeles]], a district in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], near the border with [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]]. University High is part of the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] (LAUSD). The campus also holds Indian Springs Continuation High School. The school contains the [[Serra Springs (California)|Serra Springs]], a sacred site of the [[Tongva people|Tongva–Gabrieleño]] native people and a registered [[California Historical Landmark]].

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:University High (Los Angeles) 1925.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Exterior view of Warren G. Harding High School, 1925, (later renamed 1929 as University High School)]]  --&gt;
While under construction it was known as '''Sawtelle High School''', but it opened as '''Warren G. Harding High School''' when completed in 1924, after 29th [[U.S. President|President]] [[Warren G. Harding]] (1865-1923, served 1921-1923), who had recently died.  The school was renamed in 1929 after the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California at Los Angeles]]  ([[UCLA]]) moved its campus from [[East Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|East Hollywood]] to [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]], and the reputation of former President Harding had declined after the infamous  [[Teapot Dome scandal]] and other situations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The name ''University'' is supposed to have originated because it became a site where teachers-in-training from nearby UCLA worked as assistant teachers/interns.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}

The original administration building was designed by the firm Russell &amp; Alpaugh and the construction process began in 1923. The style which was chosen recalls the Romanesque of Northern Italy and Spanish Mission style architecture. The administration building once displayed an octagonal tower and a portico, but these features were toppled in the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]]. An original cafeteria building was located where the current cafeteria and theater stand today. Although the gymnasium and a beautiful and widely admired auditorium were condemned following the 1971 [[Sylmar earthquake]], the school's original main building from 1924 remains in use. The music building and gym (rebuilt in the early 1980s) have been scheduled to be taken down because they sit on a [[fault line]] and therefore against district policy. As of July 2010, the music building is gone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blakeslee|first=Sandra|title=Seismologists Debate Los Angeles's Faults|work=The New York Times|date=August 24, 1993|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DB123CF937A1575BC0A965958260|accessdate=March 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Sharon|title=As New Schools Are Put Up, Quake Retrofits Are Put Off: Repairs lag at L.A.

Music classes have been moved to another unused room near the top of the school. The gym was still in use while, on the south end of the campus, in what was formerly a student parking lot, a new gym facility was under construction in 2010. The current football stadium, last rebuilt following the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], is named in honor of [[Jackie Robinson]] (1919-1972), of [[Pasadena, California]], the first African American professional baseball player in [[Major League Baseball]], playing in 1947-1956 for the [[History of the Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]], who also previously attended nearby UCLA, 1939-1940. 

Uni is one of a very few pre-[[World War II]] high schools in Los Angeles whose buildings have been at least partially spared by three major earthquakes since its inception.  The main building presents a very traditional and dignified appearance, with weathered brick and arched doorways, such that the campus is popular with film crews (see [[#Filming on campus]]). One-third of its class of 1942 did not graduate because of the [[Japanese American internment|internment of Japanese-Americans]].

In fall 2007, some neighborhoods zoned to have their students to attend [[Hamilton High School (Los Angeles)|Hamilton High School]] were rezoned to  University High School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laschools.org/employee/mpd/fs-mpd/download/07-08_webmaps/Proj04.pdf |title=LA Schools map |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026114047/http://www.laschools.org/employee/mpd/fs-mpd/download/07-08_webmaps/Proj04.pdf |archivedate=October 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Mitchell Landsberg of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that the school was "struggling to regain its reputation as a center of excellence".&lt;ref name=LandsbergSuccess&gt;Landsberg, Mitchell.

==Native American heritage==
{{Main article|Serra Springs (California)|Tongva}}
Located on Uni's campus are the [[Serra Springs (California)|Serra Springs]], [[California Historical Landmark]] #522. The springs, called "Kuruvungna" by the native [[Tongva people|Gabrieleno Tongva]] people, were used as a source of natural fresh water by the Tongva people since 400 &lt;small&gt;BC&lt;/small&gt;, and they continue to produce 22,000-25,000 gallons of water a day.&lt;ref name="spring age"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clkrep.lacity.org/councilfiles/05-1009_mot_5-17-05.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911225537/http://clkrep.lacity.org/councilfiles/05-1009_mot_5-17-05.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 11, 2012|title=Motion (Department of Transportation) for installion of ceremonial street signs|format=PDF|accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The springs are found at two separate locations on campus. The larger is now closed off from the rest of the campus and is under the care of the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs Foundation. Prior to its being fenced off, the area surrounding the springs and pond into which its waters feed was popular among the students as a place to meet and relax. The other spring is located on the northeastern edge of the so-called Girls' Field. A third spring was located farther north, near Texas Avenue, but it ceased to flow during the 1940s when a local water company began drawing from the aquifer.&lt;ref&gt;The Chieftain (Yearbook), 1974 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Portola expedition|Portolá Expedition of 1769]], one of the two expeditions that led to the founding of Los Angeles, camped at the Kuruvunga village while travelling along the route that would become known as [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]].&lt;ref name="community plan"&gt;{{cite news|title=West Los Angeles Community Plan| pages=III-29 - III-30|publisher=www.lacity.org/PLN|date=May 2001|url=http://cityplanning.lacity.org/complan/pdf/wlacptxt.pdf|accessdate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Serra comes from [[Junípero Serra|Father Junípero Serra]] the founder of the [[Alta California]] [[Spanish missions in California|mission]] chain, who is reported to have said [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] to there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Koenig|first=Alexa|author2=Stein, Jonathan|title=Lost in the Shuffle: State-Recognized Tribes and the Tribal Gaming Industry|page=8|publisher=The Berkeley Electronic Press|year=2005|url=http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3576&amp;context=expresso|accessdate=April 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1800s, the spring served as the water supply for the city of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]].&lt;ref name="spring age"/&gt;

Construction at the school in 1925 unearthed evidence of a Native America village, and in 1975, a grave was discovered from what archaeologists now believe to be a burial site.&lt;ref name="community plan"/&gt;

In 1980, Indian Springs Continuation High School, which is housed on the part of the campus where the springs are, was opened.&lt;ref&gt;[[California Department of Education]]'s [http://www.cde.ca.gov/re/sd/details.asp?cds=19647331930999&amp;Public=Y California School Directory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182136/http://www.cde.ca.gov/re/sd/details.asp?cds=19647331930999&amp;Public=Y|date=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1992, tribal descendants, community members, and teachers and students from the school founded the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs Foundation, a non-profit foundation, to fight a proposed development a block north of the springs that would have cut off the springs' underground water source. They successfully fought the proposed parking structure, and since that time, the Foundation has been active at the springs.&lt;ref name="Before Columbus"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Cory|title=Before Columbus: American Indians celebrate today the cultural heritage found near West Los Angeles springs|publisher=Westside Weekly|date=October 11, 1998|url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Lobby/4621/beforecolumbus.html|accessdate=April 30, 2007|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kmopSgYv?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Lobby/4621/beforecolumbus.html|archivedate=October 25, 2009|deadurl=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA School Uses Sacred Tongva Site"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carpenter|first=Susan|title=LA School Uses Sacred Tongva Site To Celebrate Columbus Day|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 13, 2005|url=http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/17036.html|accessdate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 1997–1998 school year, students were allowed to vote on a new school mascot. Students chose the "Wildcats" over the "Gators" and "Jaguars". The Class of 1985 had, as a senior project and gift to the school, painted a large Warrior mascot on the south entrance to the gym building. Shortly after the mascot change, this was painted over with its feline animal replacement.

Like other [[Los Angeles Westside|Westside]] high schools such as [[Westchester High School (Los Angeles)|Westchester]] and [[Palisades Charter High School|Palisades]], University High School enrolls a diverse mix of students from its enrollment area and various parts of the city; on top of Westside neighborhoods, Uni draws students from areas such as [[Koreatown, Los Angeles, California|Koreatown]] and [[South Los Angeles]]. The school also enrolls many [[Capacity Adjustment Program]] students which come from areas zoned to heavily overcrowded high schools.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Two new LAUSD high schools opened in fall 2005, four more in fall 2006, and one more in fall 2007, decreasing the number of transfer students in other high schools.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Ficus tree preservation==
[[File:Ficus roots (University High School).jpg|right|thumb|235px|The ficus trees after the cement was removed and before pruning.]]
Underground water from the Kuruvungna springs sustains seven mature [[Ficus macrocarpa|Indian Laurel Ficus]] trees on the campus which line a walkway between the classroom building and one of the two teachers' parking lots. In September 2002, [[Los Angeles Unified School District|LAUSD]] Area D announced that it would remove the seven ficus trees lining the outside of the classroom building, because the roots had grown into and were pushing up the concrete in the parking lot causing a potential hazard.&lt;ref name="arborist needed"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lue|first=Ryan|title=Committee Seeks Arborist to Prune Trees|publisher=Wildcat|date=September 19, 2003|url=http://myhighschooljournalism.org/ca/losangeles/uni/article.cfm?eid=818&amp;aid=9225|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011147/http://myhighschooljournalism.org/ca/losangeles/uni/article.cfm?eid=818&amp;aid=9225|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 28, 2007|accessdate=April 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the removal announcement a campaign was launched to stop the removal of the trees. Notably, a student petition got 1,200 signatures (about half of the student population), and community involvement came from the city of [[Santa Monica]] and from the neighborhood councils of [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood]] and [[West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California|West Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="trees saved"&gt;{{cite news|last=Man|first=Shirley|title=Classroom Building Trees Saved|publisher=Wildcat|date=April 28, 2003|url=http://myhighschooljournalism.com/ca/losangeles/uni/article.cfm?eid=587&amp;aid=6620|accessdate=April 22, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929081535/http://myhighschooljournalism.com/ca/losangeles/uni/article.cfm?eid=587&amp;aid=6620|archivedate=September 29, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berezin|first=Jacob|title=Theresa Gray|publisher=Wildcat|date=June 17, 2003|url=http://myhighschooljournalism.com/ca/losangeles/uni/article.cfm?eid=697&amp;aid=8139|accessdate=April 22, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929081529/http://myhighschooljournalism.com/ca/losangeles/uni/article.cfm?eid=697&amp;aid=8139|archivedate=September 29, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Public Television Programs Highlight City's "Rubbersidewalks"|work=Santa Monica SEASCAPE V.4 Issue 11|publisher=City of Santa Monica|date=Summer 2004|url=http://www.smgov.net/seascape/04summer/1.html|accessdate=April 22, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002728/http://www.smgov.net/seascape/04summer/1.html|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tamaki|first=Julie|title=Many Tree Debates Are Rooted in Age|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 29, 2003|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/330574341.html?dids=330574341:330574341&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+29%2C+2003&amp;author=Julie+Tamaki&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=B.1&amp;desc=Many+Tree+Debates+Are+Rooted+in+Age|accessdate=April 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the public outcry, the LAUSD held meetings to determine what would happen to the trees. Walter Warriner, the [[Arborist]] of the city of Santa Monica proposed installing Rubbersidewalks by Rubbersidewalks, Inc., which could be easily lifted in order to prune the tree roots for maintenance.&lt;ref name="arborist needed"/&gt;  After months of negotiations, the LAUSD decided not to remove the trees and agreed to install Rubbersidewalks, making University High School the first high school in the United States to use Rubbersidewalks in order to preserve its trees.&lt;ref name="trees saved"/&gt; Installation for the Rubbersidewalks started on November 20, 2003, over a year after the LAUSD had originally condemned the trees.Installation of the Rubbersidewalks was covered by [[Huell Howser]] for [[California's Gold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calgold.com/visiting/Default.asp?Series=1100&amp;Show=656|title=Visiting...With Huell Howser #1114 - High School Sidewalks|publisher=Calgold.com|accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode covering Uni High's Rubbersidewalks aired on [[KCET]] on January 28, 2004.&lt;ref name="pave lot"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aragon|first=Karen|title=Crews Repave Parking Lot|publisher=Wildcat|date=January 16, 2004|url=http://my.highschooljournalism.org/ca/losangeles/uni/article.cfm?eid=1311&amp;aid=16044|accessdate=April 22, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119104911/http://my.highschooljournalism.org/ca/losangeles/uni/article.cfm?eid=1311&amp;aid=16044|archivedate=January 19, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubber asphalt was also used to repave the pushed up concrete in the teachers' parking lot.&lt;ref name="pave lot"/&gt;

The doubling of the LAUSD's film revenue in the four years since FilmL.A. was original hired in March 2002 was a contributing factor to [[Burbank Unified School District]]'s decision to hire Film L.A. in July 2006.&lt;ref name="burbank leader"&gt;{{cite news |title = Entertainment Industry Development Corporation of Southern California; Financial Statement; June 30, 2003 and 2004 (With Independent Auditors' Reports Theron)|work=Notes to Financial Statement; June 30, 2003 and 2004|publisher=EIDE|page=5|url=http://www.eidc.com/Audited_Financial_Statements_FYE_2004.pdf|accessdate=May 25, 2007|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508031632/http://www.eidc.com/Audited_Financial_Statements_FYE_2004.pdf|archivedate=May 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under FilmL.A.'s current contract with the city, the company receives "a 16% management fee based on the total use fee".&lt;ref name="burbank daily"/&gt; 75 percent of the remaining filming monies go to the individual schools that host the on-location shooting to be used at the school's discretion, and 25 percent goes to a district fund that benefits schools that do not generate film revenues of their own.&lt;ref name="daily news"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LAUSD RENEWS EIDC CONTRACT TO MANAGE ON-LOCATION FILM PERMITTING; Production Grows as Source of School District Revenue|publisher=EIDC|date=March 21, 2005|url=http://www.eidc.com/LAUSD_Release.pdf|accessdate=May 24, 2007|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508020657/http://www.eidc.com/LAUSD_Release.pdf|archivedate=May 8, 2007}} A [http://www.digital50.com/news/items/PR/2005/03/21/LAM075/lausd-renews-eidc-contract-to-manage-on-location-film-permitting.html text version]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119035453/http://www.digital50.com/news/items/PR/2005/03/21/LAM075/lausd-renews-eidc-contract-to-manage-on-location-film-permitting.html |date=January 19, 2008 }} of the article is available at [http://www.digital50.com Digital50.com; An American Digital Networks Production]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003073208/http://www.digital50.com/ |date=October 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Uni High distributes among the departments the first $12,000 made each year from on-campus filming.&lt;ref name="donations valued"/&gt; The Budget Committee makes spending recommendations for any additional monies. Recent budget cuts have made filming at schools more attractive.&lt;ref name="marketplace"/&gt;&lt;ref name="schools close-up"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="film friendly"/&gt; In 2004, the number of schools volunteering to be film locations grew from 19 to 160 and the district's annual film revenue doubled to $1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="schools close-up"/&gt; In 2005,
LAUSD officials revised the district's fee structure for the first time since 1992. The revision included extending a full day of shooting from 14 to 15 hours, and a daily rate increase from $1,700 to $2,500.&lt;ref name="daily news"/&gt;

Uni has been noted in the press as being one of the more popular schools for filming, even compared to other local schools with similar structure and appearance.&lt;ref name="csm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="film friendly"/&gt; In a two-year period ending in 2003, 38 movies, TV shows and commercials were filmed at University High.&lt;ref name="schools close-up"/&gt; This popularity, with both its positive and negative impacts, is credited to the Assistant Principal who is responsible for the filming on campus.&lt;ref name="csm"/&gt;

In November 2006, ''[[Drillbit Taylor]]'', starring [[Owen Wilson]] began filming at Uni. As of April 2007, the $90,000 received for this production is the most that the school has made on an individual filming contract.&lt;ref name="drillbit setup"/&gt; Uni underwent massive renovations in order to prepare for the filming of ''Drillbit Taylor''. The interior and exterior of the main building were painted, and the main building was retiled as well. The facade of the building was altered to read "McKinley High School", and plants and grass patches were added throughout the school.&lt;ref name="drillbit setup"/&gt; 

These changes were unusual not only because the extent and timing of the changes meant that construction took place during the school year, but also because ''Drillbit Taylor'' production did not pay for the re-tiling.&lt;ref name="lausd re-floors admin building"/&gt; The district had provided money to re-tile floors throughout the [[Los Angeles Unified School District|LAUSD]],&lt;ref name="lausd re-floors admin building"/&gt; so the re-tiling of the floors itself was not unusual or controversial. However, as the film's production needs guided the color choices for the re-tiling and the schedule for construction, many students were upset by the behavior of the movie company and the school.&lt;ref name="lausd re-floors admin building"/&gt;

Below is an incomplete list of productions that have filmed at University High:

[[Constructed wetland]]s are used to treat municipal and industrial [[wastewater]] as well as [[stormwater]] runoff. They may also play a role in [[water-sensitive urban design]].

==Definitions==
A patch of land that develops pools of water after a [[rain storm]] would not necessarily be considered a "wetland", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other [[water bodies]] or [[landform]]s based on their [[water level]] and on the types of [[plant]]s that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a [[water table]] that stands at or near the [[land surface]] for a long enough period each year to support [[aquatic plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvwd.net/water_glossary.htm |title= Glossary of Terms |publisher=Carpinteria Valley Water District |accessdate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425163056/http://www.cvwd.net/water_glossary.htm |archivedate=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mapping2.orr.noaa.gov/portal/calcasieu/calc_html/resources/glossary.html |title=Glossary |publisher=Mapping2.orr.noaa.gov |accessdate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425163041/http://mapping2.orr.noaa.gov/portal/calcasieu/calc_html/resources/glossary.html |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more concise definition is a community composed of [[hydric soil]] and [[hydrophytes]].&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt;

Wetlands have also been described as [[ecotone]]s, providing a transition between dry land and water bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alabamapower.com/hydro/glossary.asp |title=Glossary |publisher=Alabama Power |accessdate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321233304/http://www.alabamapower.com/hydro/glossary.asp |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitsch and Gosselink write that wetlands exist "...at the interface between truly [[terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] ecosystems and [[aquatic habitat|aquatic]] systems, making them inherently different from each other, yet highly dependent on both."&lt;ref name="mitsch2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitsch

In environmental decision-making, there are subsets of definitions that are agreed upon to make regulatory and policy decisions.

===Technical definitions===
[[File:Sunrise at viru bog.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Sunrise at Viru Bog, Estonia]]
A wetland is "an ecosystem that arises when inundation by water produces soils dominated by anaerobic and aerobic processes, which, in turn, forces the biota, particularly rooted plants, to adapt to flooding."{{sfnp|Keddy|2010|p=2}} There are four main kinds of wetlands&amp;nbsp;– [[marsh]], [[swamp]], [[bog]] and [[fen]] (bogs and fens being types of [[mire]]s). Some experts also recognize wet meadows and aquatic ecosystems as additional wetland types.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt; The largest wetlands in the world include the swamp forests of the Amazon and the peatlands of Siberia.&lt;ref name="FraserKeddy"/&gt;

====Ramsar Convention definition====
Under the [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar international wetland conservation treaty]], wetlands are defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ramsar 40th Anniversary Message for November| publisher = Ramsar| accessdate = 2011-10-10 | url = http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-home/main/ramsar/1_4000_0__}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Article 1.1: "...wetlands are areas of marsh, [[fen]], [[peatland]] or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, [[fresh water|fresh]], [[brackish water|brackish]] or [[saline water|salt]], including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres."
*Article 2.1: "[Wetlands] may incorporate [[riparian]] and coastal zones adjacent to the wetlands, and [[island]]s or bodies of marine water deeper than six metres at [[low tide]] lying within the wetlands."

====Regional definitions====
Although the general definition given above applies around the world, each county and region tends to have its own definition for legal purposes. In the United States, wetlands are defined as "those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/guidance/wetlands/definitions.cfm|title=EPA Regulations listed at 40 CFR 230.3(t)|accessdate=2014-02-18|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition has been used in the enforcement of the [[Clean Water Act]]. Some US states, such as [[Massachusetts]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], have separate definitions that may differ from the federal government's.

In the [[United States Code]], the term wetland is defined "as land that (A) has a predominance of hydric soils, (B) is inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions and (C) under normal circumstances supports a prevalence of such vegetation." Related to this legal definitions, the term "normal circumstances" are conditions expected to occur during the wet portion of the growing season under normal climatic conditions (not unusually dry or unusually wet), and in the absence of significant disturbance. It is not uncommon for a wetland to be dry for long portions of the growing season. Wetlands can be dry during the dry season and abnormally dry periods during the wet season, but under normal environmental conditions the soils in a wetland will be saturated to the surface or inundated such that the soils become anaerobic, and those conditions will persist through the wet portion of the growing season.&lt;ref&gt;US Government Publishing Office. (2011) [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/3801 16 U.S. Code Chapter 58 Subchapter I, § 3801 – Definitions]. Legal Information Institute,  Cornell Law School, Ithaca.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
The most important factor producing wetlands is [[flooding]]. The duration of flooding or prolonged soil saturation by [[groundwater]] determines whether the resulting wetland has aquatic, [[marsh]] or [[swamp]] [[vegetation]]. Other important factors include fertility, natural disturbance, competition, [[herbivory]], burial and salinity.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt; When [[peat]] accumulates, [[bog]]s and [[fen]]s arise.

==Characteristics==
Wetlands vary widely due to local and regional differences in [[topography]], [[hydrology]], [[vegetation]], and other factors, including human involvement.

==Hydrology==
Wetland hydrology is associated with the spatial and temporal dispersion, flow, and physio-chemical attributes of surface and ground water in its reservoirs. Based on hydrology, wetlands can be categorized as [[riverine]] (associated with streams), [[wikt:lacustrine|lacustrine]] (associated with lakes and reservoirs), and [[palustrine]] (isolated). Sources of hydrological flows into wetlands are predominantly [[precipitation]], surface water, and [[groundwater]]. Water flows out of wetlands by [[evapotranspiration]], [[surface runoff]], and subsurface water outflow. [[Hydrodynamics]] (the movement of water through and from a wetland) affects hydro-periods (temporal fluctuations in water levels) by controlling the water balance and water storage within a wetland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=J. L.|last2=Arndt|first2=J. L.|last3=Montgomery|first3=J. A.|date=2001|contribution=Hydrology of wetland and related soils|editor1-first=J. L.|editor1-last=Richardson|editor2-first=M. J.|editor2-last=Vepraskas|title=Wetland Soils|publisher=Lewis Publishers|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape characteristics control wetland hydrology and [[hydrochemistry]]. The [[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[concentration (chemistry)|concentrations]] of water depend on [[temperature]] and [[atmospheric pressure]]. Hydrochemistry within wetlands is determined by the [[pH]], [[salinity]], nutrients, [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]], soil composition, [[Water hardness|hardness]], and the sources of water. Water chemistry of wetlands varies across landscapes and climatic regions. Wetlands are generally [[minerotrophic]] with the exception of bogs.

Bogs receive most of their water from the [[atmosphere]]; therefore, their water usually has low mineral ionic composition. In contrast, groundwater has a higher concentration of dissolved nutrients and minerals.

The water chemistry of fens ranges from low pH and low minerals to alkaline with high accumulation of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] because they acquire their water from precipitation as well as ground water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vitt|first1=D. H.|last2=Chee|first2=W|date=1990|title=The relationships of vegetation to surface water chemistry and peat chemistry in fens of Alberta, Canada|journal=Plant Ecology|volume=89|issue=2|pages=87–106|doi=10.1007/bf00032163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of salinity===

Salinity has a strong influence on wetland water chemistry, particularly in wetlands along the coast.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=B. R.|editor1-last=Silliman|editor2-first=E. D.|editor2-last=Grosholz|editor3-first=M. D.|editor3-last=Bertness|date=2009|title=Human Impacts on Salt Marshes: A Global Perspective|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in regions with large precipitation deficits. In non-riverine wetlands, natural salinity is regulated by interactions between ground and surface water, which may be influenced by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=M. J.|last2=Schreiber|first2=E. S. G.|last3=Kohout|first3=M.|last4=Ough|first4=K.|last5=Lennie|first5=R.|last6=Turnbull|first6=D.|last7=Jin|first7=C.|last8=Clancy|first8=T.|date=2007|title=Wetlands as landscape units: spatial patterns in salinity and water chemistry|journal=Wetlands, Ecology &amp; Management|volume=15|issue=2|pages=95–103|doi=10.1007/s11273-006-9015-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soil===
[[Carbon]] is the major nutrient cycled within wetlands. Most nutrients, such as [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[carbon]], and [[nitrogen]] are found within the soil of wetlands. [[Anaerobic respiration|Anaerobic]] and [[aerobic respiration]] in the soil influences the nutrient cycling of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ponnamperuma|first=F. N.|date=1972|title=The chemistry of submerged soils|journal=Advances in Agronomy|volume=24|pages=29–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the solubility of phosphorus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=P. A., Jr.|last2=Reddy|first2=K. R.|date=1994|title=Role of Eh and pH on phosphorus geochemistry in sediments of Lake Okeechobee, Florida|journal=Journal of Environmental Quality|volume=23|issue=5|pages=955–964|doi=10.2134/jeq1994.00472425002300050016x}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus contributing to the chemical variations in its water. Wetlands with low pH and saline conductivity may reflect the presence of acid [[sulfate]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minh|first1=L. Q.|last2=Tuong|first2=T. P.|last3=van Mensvoort|first3=M. E. F.|last4=Bouma|first4=J.|date=1998|title=Soil and water table management effects on aluminum dynamics in an acid sulphate soil in Vietnam|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=68|issue=3|pages=255–262|doi=10.1016/s0167-8809(97)00158-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wetlands with average salinity levels can be heavily influenced by calcium or magnesium. [[Biogeochemistry|Biogeochemical processes]] in wetlands are determined by soils with low [[redox]] potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=W. A.|date=1997|title=Biogeochemistry: An Analysis of Global Change|edition=2nd|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetland soils are identified by [[redoxymorphic]] mottles or low [[Munsell color system#Chroma|chroma]], as determined by the [[Munsell Color System]].

===Biota===
The [[biota (ecology)|biota]] of a wetland system includes its flora and fauna as described below. The most important factor affecting the biota is the duration of flooding.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt; Other important factors include fertility and salinity. In [[fen]]s, species are highly dependent on water chemistry. The chemistry of water flowing into wetlands depends on the source of water and the geological material in which it flows through&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bedford|first=B. L.|date=1996|title=The need to define hydrologic equivalence at the landscape scale for freshwater wetland mitigation|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=1|pages=57–68|doi=10.2307/2269552|jstor=2269552}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the nutrients discharged from organic matter in the soils and plants at higher elevations in slope wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=M. L.|last2=Rhoades|first2=C. C.|last3=Dwire|first3=K. A.|date=2011|title=Influences of Bedrock Geology on Water Chemistry of Slope Wetlands and Headwaters Streams in the Southern Rocky Mountains|journal=Wetlands|volume=31|issue=2|pages=251–261|doi=10.1007/s13157-011-0157-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biota may vary within a wetland due to season or recent flood regimes.

====Flora====
[[File:Nelumbo nucifera LOTUS bud.jpg|thumb|Bud of ''[[Nelumbo nucifera]]'', an aquatic plant.]]

There are four main groups of [[hydrophyte]]s that are found in wetland systems throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blacktown Council wetlands |accessdate=2011-09-25 |url=http://www.blacktown.nsw.gov.au/environment/educational-resources/wetlands/animals-plants-and-algae-in-wetlands.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410125002/http://www.blacktown.nsw.gov.au/environment/educational-resources/wetlands/animals-plants-and-algae-in-wetlands.cfm |archivedate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Submergent plant|Submerged]] wetland vegetation can grow in saline and fresh-water conditions. Some species have underwater flowers, while others have long stems to allow the flowers to reach the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutchinson|first1=G. E.|date=1975|title=A Treatise on Limnology. Vol. 3: Limnological Botany|location=New York, NY|publisher=John Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Submerged species provide a food source for native fauna, habitat for invertebrates, and also possess filtration capabilities. Examples include [[seagrasses]] and [[Vallisneria|eelgrass]].

Floating water plants or floating vegetation is usually small, like arrow arum (''[[Peltandra virginica]]'').

Trees and shrubs, where they comprise much of the cover in saturated soils, qualify those areas in most cases as [[swamp]]s.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt; The upland boundary of swamps is determined partly by water levels. This can be affected by dams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Hughes|editor-first=F. M. R.|date=2003|title=The Flooded Forest: Guidance for policy makers and river managers in Europe on the restoration of floodplain forests|series=FLOBAR2, Department of Geography, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some swamps can be dominated by a single species, such as [[silver maple]] swamps around the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilcox|first1=D. A|last2=Thompson|first2=T. A.|last3=Booth|first3=R. K.|last4=Nicholas|first4=J. R.|date=2007|title=Lake-level variability and water availability in the Great Lakes|series=USGS Circular 1311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like those of the [[Amazon basin]], have large numbers of different tree species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goulding|first=M.|date=1980|title=The Fishes and the Forest: Explorations in Amazonian Natural History|location=Berkeley, CA|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include cypress (''[[Taxodium]]'') and [[mangrove]].

====Fauna====
[[File:Northern Leopard Frog (Lithobates pipiens).jpg|thumb|Many species of [[frog]]s live in wetlands, while others visit them each year to lay eggs.]]
[[File:Snapping turtle 3 md.jpg|thumb|[[Snapping turtle]]s are one of the many kinds of turtles found in wetlands.]]
[[Fish]] are more dependent on wetland ecosystems than any other type of habitat. Seventy-five percent of the United States' commercial fish and shellfish stocks depend solely on estuaries to survive.&lt;ref name="ramsar_a"&gt;{{cite web | title=Ramsar Convention Ecosystem Services Benefit Factsheets| accessdate = 2011-09-25 | url = http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-pubs-info-ecosystem-services/main/ramsar/1-30-103%5E24258_4000_0__}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical fish species need mangroves for critical hatchery and nursery grounds and the coral reef system for food.

[[Amphibian]]s such as [[frog]]s need both terrestrial and aquatic habitats in which to reproduce and feed. While tadpoles control algal populations, adult frogs forage on insects. Frogs are used as an indicator of [[ecosystem health]] due to their thin skin which absorbs both nutrient and toxins from the surrounding environment resulting in an above average extinction rate in unfavorable and polluted environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savethefrogs.com/why-frogs/ |title=Frogs {{!}} Bioindicators |website=Savethefrogs.com |date=2011 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Reptile]]s such as [[alligator]]s and [[crocodile]]s are common in wetlands of some regions. Alligators occur in fresh water along with the fresh water species of the crocodile.The Florida [[Everglades]] is the only place in the world where both crocodiles and alligators coexist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mazzotti, F.J. |author2=Best, G.R. |author3=Brandt, L.A. |author4=Cherkiss, M.S. |author5=Jeffery, B.M. |author6=Rice, K.G. |year=2009 |title=Alligators and crocodiles as indicators for restoration of Everglades ecosystems |journal=Ecological Indicators 9(6) |page=S137−S149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[saltwater crocodile]] inhabits estuaries and mangroves and can be seen in the coastline bordering the [[Great Barrier Reef]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Messel, H. 1981. Surveys of tidal river systems in the Northern Territory of Australia and their crocodile populations (Vol. 1). Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Snake]]s, [[lizard]]s and [[turtle]]s also can be seen throughout wetlands. [[Snapping turtle]]s are one of the many kinds of turtles found in wetlands.
 
[[Bird]]s, particularly [[waterfowl]] and [[Wader|wading birds]], use wetlands extensively&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Wetland birds: habitat resources and conservation implications |last=Milton |first=W. |date=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0511011368 |location=Cambridge|oclc=50984660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mammal]]s include numerous small and medium-sized species such as [[vole]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[bat]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and [[platypus]] in addition to large herbivorous and apex species such as the [[beaver]], [[coypu]], [[swamp rabbit]], [[Florida panther]], and [[moose]]. Wetlands attract many mammals due to abundant seeds, berries, and other vegetation components, as well as abundant populations of prey such as invertebrates, small reptiles and amphibians.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

[[Insect]]s and [[invertebrate]]s total more than half of the 100,000 known animal species in wetlands. Insects and invertebrates can be submerged in the water or soil, on the surface, and in the atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Invertebrates in freshwater wetlands of North America : ecology and management|date=1999|publisher=Wiley|others=Batzer, Darold P., Rader, Russell Ben., Wissinger, Scott A.|isbn=978-0471292586|location=New York|oclc=39747651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Algae====

[[Algae]] are diverse water plants that can vary in size, color, and shape. Algae occur naturally in habitats such as inland lakes, inter-tidal zones, and damp soil and provide a dedicated food source for many animals, including some invertebrates, fish, turtles, and frogs. There are three main groups of algae:

*[[Plankton]] are algae which are [[microscopic]], free-floating algae. This algae is so tiny that on average, if 50 of these microscopic algae were lined up end-to-end, it would only measure one millimetre.

==Climates==
===Temperature===
[[File:MiddleSpring.JPG|thumb|Wetlands contrast the hot, arid landscape around Middle Spring, [[Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge]], [[Utah]]]]
Wetlands are located in every climatic zone.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Temperatures vary greatly depending on the location of the wetland. Many of the world's wetlands are in [[temperate zone]]s, midway between the North or South Pole and the equator. In these zones, summers are warm and winters are cold, but temperatures are not extreme. In a temperate zone wetland, such as one along the [[Gulf of Mexico]], a typical temperature might be {{convert|11|C|F}}. Wetlands in the [[tropics]] are much warmer for a larger portion of the year. Wetlands on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] can reach temperatures exceeding {{convert|50|C|F}} and would therefore be subject to rapid evaporation. In northeastern [[Siberia]], which has a polar climate, wetland temperatures can be as low as {{convert|−50|C|F}}. [[Peatland]]s insulate the [[permafrost]] in subarctic regions, thus delaying or preventing thawing of [[permafrost]] during summer, as well as inducing the formation of [[permafrost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ramsar.org/document/peatlands-climate-change-mitigation-and-biodiversity-conservation|title=PEATLANDS, CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|deadurl=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precipitation===
The amount of precipitation a wetland receives varies widely according to its area. Wetlands in [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and western [[Ireland]] typically receive about {{convert|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year. In some places in [[Southeast Asia]], where heavy rains occur, they can receive up to {{convert|10000|mm|in|abbr=on}}. In some drier regions, wetlands exist where as little as {{convert|180|mm|in|abbr=on}} precipitation occurs each year. {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Uses of wetlands==

Depending partly on a wetland's geographic and topographic location,&lt;ref&gt;Adamus, P.R. and L.T. Stockwell. 1983. ''A Method for Wetland Functional Assessment.'' Vol. I. Critical Review and Evaluation Concepts. FHWA-IP-82-23. Federal Highway Admin., Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; the functions it performs can support multiple [[ecosystem services]], values, or benefits. [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] and [[Ramsar Convention]] described wetlands as a whole to be of [[biosphere]] significance and societal importance in the following areas, for example:{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

*[[Flood control|Water storage (flood control)]]
*Groundwater replenishment
*Shoreline stabilisation and storm protection
*[[Water purification]]
*Reservoirs of [[biodiversity]]
*Pollination
*Wetland products
*Cultural values
*Recreation and [[Eco tourism|tourism]]
*[[Climate change mitigation]] and adaptation

According to the Ramsar Convention:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The economic worth of the ecosystem services provided to society by intact, naturally functioning wetlands is frequently much greater than the perceived benefits of converting them to 'more valuable' intensive land use – particularly as the profits from unsustainable use often go to relatively few individuals or corporations, rather than being shared by society as a whole.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Unless otherwise cited, ecosystem services information is based on the following series of references.''&lt;ref name="ramsar_a"/&gt;

To replace these wetland [[ecosystem services]], enormous amounts of money would need to be spent on [[water purification]] plants, dams, levees, and other hard infrastructure, and many of the services are impossible to replace.

=== Water storage (flood control) ===
''Major wetland type: floodplain and closed-depression wetlands''

'''Storage reservoirs and flood protection:''' The wetland system of [[floodplains]] is formed from major rivers downstream from their [[headwaters]]. "The floodplains of major rivers act as natural storage reservoirs, enabling excess water to spread out over a wide area, which reduces its depth and speed. Wetlands close to the headwaters of streams and rivers can slow down rainwater runoff and spring snowmelt so that it doesn't run straight off the land into water courses. This can help prevent sudden, damaging floods downstream."&lt;ref name="ramsar_a" /&gt; Notable river systems that produce large spans of floodplain include the [[Nile River]], the Niger river inland delta, [the Zambezi River flood plain], [the Okavango River inland delta], [the Kafue River flood plain][the Lake Bangweulu flood plain] (Africa), [[Mississippi River]] (USA), [[Amazon River]] (South America), [[Yangtze River]] (China), [[Danube River]] (Central Europe) and [[Murray-Darling]] River (Australia).

'''Human impact:''' Converting wetlands to upland through drainage and development forces adjoining or downstream water channels into narrower corridors. This accelerates watershed hydrologic response to storm events and this increases the need in some cases for alternative means of flood control. That is because the newly formed channels must manage the same amount of precipitation, causing flood peaks to be [higher or deeper] and floodwaters to travel faster.

Water management engineering developments in the past century have degraded these wetlands through the construction of artificial embankments. These constructions may be classified as [[Levee|dykes]], bunds, [[levees]], [[weirs]], barrages and [[dams]] but serve the single purpose of concentrating water into a select source or area. Wetland water sources that were once spread slowly over a large, shallow area are pooled into deep, concentrated locations. Loss of wetland floodplains results in more severe and damaging flooding. Catastrophic human impact in the Mississippi River floodplains was seen in death of several hundred individuals during a [[levee breach]] in New Orleans caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Ecological catastrophic events from human-made embankments have been noticed along the Yangtze River floodplains since the middle of the river has become prone to more frequent and damaging flooding. Some of these events include the loss of [[riparian vegetation]], a 30% loss of the vegetation cover throughout the river's basin, a doubling of the percentage of the land affected by soil erosion, and a reduction in reservoir capacity through [[siltation]] build-up in floodplain lakes.&lt;ref name="ramsar_a"/&gt;

===Groundwater replenishment===
''Major wetland type: [[marsh]], [[swamp]], and subterranean [[karst]] and cave hydrological systems''

The [[surface water]] which is the water visibly seen in wetland systems only represents a portion of the overall water cycle which also includes [[atmospheric water]] and [[groundwater]]. Wetland systems are directly linked to groundwater and a crucial regulator of both the quantity and [[water quality|quality of water]] found below the ground. Wetland systems that are made of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]] [[sediment]]s like [[limestone]] or occur in areas with highly variable and fluctuating water tables especially have a role in [[groundwater replenishment]] or [[water recharge]]. Sediments that are [[porous]] allow water to filter down through the soil and overlying rock into [[aquifers]] which are the source of 95% of the world's drinking water. Wetlands can also act as recharge areas when the surrounding water table is low and as a discharge zone when it is too high. [[Karst cave|Karst]] (cave) systems are a unique example of this system and are a connection of underground rivers influenced by rain and other forms of [[precipitation]]. These wetland systems are capable of regulating changes in the water table on upwards of {{convert|130|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

'''Human impact''': Groundwater is an important source of water for [[drinking water|drinking]] and [[irrigation]] of crops. Over 1&amp;nbsp;billion people in Asia and 65% of the public water sources in Europe source 100% of their water from groundwater. Irrigation is a massive use of groundwater with 80% of the world's groundwater used for agricultural production.&lt;ref name="ramsar_a"/&gt;

Unsustainable abstraction of groundwater has become a major concern. In the Commonwealth of [[Australia]], water licensing is being implemented to control use of water in major agricultural regions. On a global scale, groundwater deficits and water scarcity is one of the most pressing concerns facing the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ramsar_a"/&gt;

===Shoreline stabilization and storm protection===
''Wetland type: [[Mangrove]]s, [[coral reef]]s, [[salt marsh]]''

{{Main|Integrated coastal zone management}}

Tidal and inter-tidal wetland systems protect and stabilize coastal zones. [[Coral reefs]] provide a protective barrier to coastal shoreline. [[Mangroves]] stabilize the coastal zone from the interior and will migrate with the shoreline to remain adjacent to the boundary of the water. The main conservation benefit these systems have against storms and [[storm surge]]s is the ability to reduce the speed and height of waves and floodwaters.

'''Human impact''': The sheer number of people who live and work near the coast is expected to grow immensely over the next fifty years. From an estimated 200&amp;nbsp;million people that currently live in low-lying coastal regions, the development of urban coastal centers is projected to increase the population by fivefold within 50 years.&lt;ref name="urlUNEP-Home"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2011-12-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The United Kingdom has begun the concept of managed coastal realignment. This management technique provides shoreline protection through restoration of natural wetlands rather than through applied engineering. In East Asia, reclamation of coastal wetlands has resulted in widespread transformation of the coastal zone, and up to 65% of coastal wetlands have been destroyed by coastal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | first1 = J. | last1 = MacKinnon | first2 = Y.

===Water purification===
''Wetland types: floodplain, closed-depression wetlands, [[mudflat]], [[salt marsh]], mangroves''

'''Nutrient retention:''' Wetlands cycle both sediments and nutrients balancing [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] and [[aquatic ecosystems]]. A natural function of wetland vegetation is the up-take, storage, and (for nitrate) the removal of nutrients found in [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from the surrounding soil and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wild.org/blog/letting-nature-do-the-job|title=Letting Nature Do the Job|date=2008-08-01|website=Wild.org|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113192135/http://www.wild.org/blog/letting-nature-do-the-job|archive-date=2013-01-13|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many wetlands, nutrients are retained until plants die or are harvested by animals or humans and taken to another location, or until microbial processes convert soluble nutrients to a gas as is the case with nitrate.

'''Sediment and heavy metal traps:''' Precipitation and surface runoff induces [[soil erosion]], transporting sediment in suspension into and through waterways. These sediments move towards larger and more sizable waterways through a natural process that moves water towards oceans. All types of sediments which may be composed of clay, sand, silt, and rock can be carried into wetland systems through this process. Wetland vegetation acts as a physical barrier to slow water flow and trap sediment for short or long periods of time. Suspended sediment often contains heavy metals that are retained when wetlands trap the sediment. In some cases, certain metals are taken up through wetland plant stems, roots, and leaves. Many floating plant species, for example, can absorb and filter heavy metals. [[Water hyacinth]] (''Eichhornia crassipes''), [[duckweed]] (''Lemna'') and [[water fern]] (''Azolla'') store [[iron]] and [[copper]] commonly found in [[wastewater]]. Many fast-growing plants rooted in the soils of wetlands such as [[cattail]] (''Typha'') and [[Phragmites|reed]] (''Phragmites'') also aid in the role of heavy metal up-take. Animals such as the [[oyster]] can filter more than {{convert|200|L|gal}} of water per day while grazing for food, removing nutrients, suspended sediments, and chemical contaminants in the process. On the other hand, some types of wetlands facilitate the mobilization and bioavailability of mercury (another heavy metal), which in its [[Methylmercury|methyl mercury]] form increases the risk of bioaccumulation in fish important to animal food webs and harvested for human consumption.

'''Capacity:''' The ability of wetland systems to store or remove nutrients and trap sediment and associated metals is highly efficient and effective but each system has a threshold. An overabundance of nutrient input from fertilizer run-off, sewage effluent, or non-point pollution will cause [[eutrophication]]. Upstream erosion from deforestation can overwhelm wetlands making them shrink in size and cause dramatic [[biodiversity loss]] through excessive sedimentation load. Retaining high levels of metals in sediments is problematic if the sediments become resuspended or oxygen and pH levels change at a future time. The capacity of wetland vegetation to store heavy metals depends on the particular metal, oxygen and pH status of wetland sediments and overlying water, water flow rate (detention time), wetland size, season, climate, type of plant, and other factors.

'''Human impact''': The capacity of a wetland to store sediment, nutrients, and metals can be diminished if sediments are compacted such as by vehicles or heavy equipment, or are regularly tilled. Unnatural changes in water levels and water sources also can affect the water purification function. If water purification functions are impaired, excessive loads of nutrients enter waterways and cause [[eutrophication]]. This is of particular concern in temperate coastal systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valiela|first1=I.|last2=Collins|first2=G.|last3=Kremer|first3=J.|last4=Lajtha|first4=K.|last5=Geist|first5=M.|last6=Seely|first6=B.|last7=Brawley|first7=J.|last8=Sham|first8=C.

'''Examples:''' An example of how a natural wetland is used to provide some degree of [[sewage treatment]] is the [[East Kolkata Wetlands]] in [[Kolkata, India]]. The wetlands cover {{convert|125|km2|sqmi}}, and are used to treat Kolkata's sewage. The nutrients contained in the wastewater sustain fish farms and agriculture.

===Constructed wetlands===
[[File:Flintenbreite constructed wetland.jpg|thumb|Constructed wetland in an ecological settlement in Flintenbreite near Luebeck, Germany]]
{{main|Constructed wetland}}
The function of most natural wetland systems is not to manage  [[wastewater]]. However, their high potential for the filtering and the treatment of pollutants has been recognized by environmental engineers that specialize in the area of [[Wastewater treatment systems|wastewater treatment]]. These constructed wetland systems are highly controlled environments that intend to mimic the occurrences of soil, flora, and microorganisms in natural wetlands to aid in treating wastewater effluent. Constructed wetlands can be used to treat raw sewage, storm water, agricultural and [[industrial effluent]]. They are constructed with flow regimes, micro-biotic composition, and suitable plants in order to produce the most efficient treatment process. Other advantages of constructed wetlands are the control of [[retention time]]s and [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulic]] channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brix|first=H|date=1993|contribution=Wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands: system design, removal processes, and treatment performance|editor-first=A. G.|editor-last=Moshiri|title=Constructed Wetlands for Water Quality Improvement|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important factors of constructed wetlands are the water flow processes combined with plant growth.

Constructed wetland systems can be surface flow systems with only free-floating [[macrophytes]], floating-leaved macrophytes, or submerged macrophytes; however, typical free water surface systems are usually constructed with emergent macrophytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vymazal|first1=J.|last2=Kröpfleova|first2=L.|date=2008|title=Wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands with horizontal sub-surface flow|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=14}}{{page needed|date=January 2017|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-8580-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsurface flow-constructed wetlands with a vertical or a horizontal flow regime are also common and can be integrated into urban areas as they require relatively little space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoffmann|first1=H.|last2=Platzer|first2=C.|last3=von Münch|first3=E.|last4=Winker|first4=M.|date=2011|url=http://www.susana.org/_resources/documents/default/2-930-giz2011-en-technology-review-constructed-wetlands.pdf |title=Technology review of constructed wetlands – Subsurface flow constructed wetlands for greywater and domestic wastewater treatment|publisher=[[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit]]|location=Eschborn, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reservoirs of biodiversity===

Wetland systems' rich [[biodiversity]] is becoming a focal point at International Treaty Conventions and within the [[World Wildlife Fund]] organization due to the high number of species present in wetlands, the small global geographic area of wetlands, the number of species which are [[endemic]] to wetlands, and the high productivity of wetland systems. Hundred of thousands of animal species, 20,000 of them vertebrates, are living in wetland systems. The discovery rate of fresh water fish is at 200 new species per year. The impact of maintaining biodiversity is seen at the local level through job creation, sustainability, and community productivity. A good example is the Lower Mekong basin which runs through Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Supporting over 55&amp;nbsp;million people, the sustainability of the region is enhanced through wildlife tours. The U.S. state of Florida has estimated that US$1.6&amp;nbsp;billion was generated in state revenue from recreational activities associated with wildlife.

'''Biodiverse river basins:''' The Amazon holds 3,000 species of freshwater fish species within the boundaries of its basin, whose function it is to disperse the seeds of trees. One of its key species, the Piramutaba catfish, ''Brachyplatystoma vaillantii'', migrates more than {{convert|3300|km|mi|abbr=on}} from its nursery grounds near the mouth of the Amazon River to its spawning grounds in Andean tributaries, {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, distributing plants seed along the route.

'''Productive intertidal zones:''' Intertidal mudflats have a level of productivity similar to that of some wetlands even while possessing a low number of species. The abundance of [[invertebrates]] found within the mud are a food source for [[migratory waterfowl]].

'''Critical life-stage habitat:''' Mudflats, saltmarshes, mangroves, and seagrass beds have high levels of both species richness and productivity, and are home to important nursery areas for many commercial fish stocks.

'''Genetic diversity:''' Populations of many species are confined geographically to only one or a few wetland systems, often due to the long period of time that the wetlands have been physically isolated from other aquatic sources. For example, the number of [[endemic species]] in [[Lake Baikal]] in Russia classifies it as a hotspot for biodiversity and one of the most biodiverse wetlands in the entire world. Evidence from a research study by Mazepova ''et al.'' suggest that the number of [[crustacean]] species endemic to Baikal Lake (over 690 species and subspecies) exceeds the number of the same groups of animals inhabiting all the fresh water bodies of Eurasia together. Its 150 species of free-living [[Platyhelminthes]] alone is analogous to the entire number in all of Eastern Siberia. The 34 species and subspecies number of [[Baikal sculpins]] is more than twice the number of the analogous fauna that inhabits Eurasia. One of the most exciting discoveries was made by A.&amp;nbsp;V. Shoshin who registered about 300 species of free-living [[nematodes]] using only six near-shore sampling localities in the Southern Baikal. "If we will take into consideration, that about 60% of the animals can be found nowhere else except Baikal, it may be assumed that the lake may be the biodiversity center of the Eurasian continent."&lt;ref name="Baikal"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Timoshkin|editor-first=O. A.|title=Index of animal species inhabiting Lake Baikal and its catchment area. Guides and Keys to Identification of Fauna and Flora of Lake Baikal|edition=1st|volume=1|date=2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Novosibirsk, Nauka|isbn=978-5-02-031736-9|work=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MUCsAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human impact:''' Biodiversity loss occurs in wetland systems through land use changes, habitat destruction, pollution, exploitation of resources, and invasive species. Vulnerable, threatened, and [[endangered species]] number at 17% of waterfowl, 38% of fresh-water dependent mammals, 33% of freshwater fish, 26% of freshwater amphibians, 72% of freshwater turtles, 86% of marine turtles, 43% of crocodilians and 27% of coral reef-building species. Introduced hydrophytes in different wetland systems can have devastating results. The introduction of [[water hyacinth]], a native plant of South America into Lake Victoria in East Africa as well as [[duckweed]] into non-native areas of Queensland, Australia, have overtaken entire wetland systems suffocating the wetlands and reducing the diversity of other plants and animals. This is largely due to their phenomenal growth rate and ability to float and grow on the surface of the water.

===Wetland products and productivity===

Wetland productivity is linked to the climate, wetland type, and nutrient availability. Low water and occasional drying of the wetland bottom during [[drought]]s (dry marsh phase) stimulate plant recruitment from a diverse [[seed bank]] and increase productivity by mobilizing nutrients. In contrast, high water during [[deluge (prehistoric)|deluge]]s (lake marsh phase) causes turnover in plant populations and creates greater interspersion of element cover and open water, but lowers overall productivity. During a cover cycle that ranges from open water to complete vegetation cover, annual net primary productivity may vary 20-fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=W. C.|last2=Millett|first2=B. V.|last3=Gilmanov|first3=T.|last4=Voldseth|first4=R. A.|last5=Guntenspergen|first5=G. R.|last6=Naugle|first6=D. E.|date=2005|title=Vulnerability of Northern Prairie Wetlands to Climate Change|journal=Bio Science|volume=10|pages=863–872}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grasses of fertile floodplains such as the Nile produce the highest yield including
plants such as ''[[Arundo donax]]'' (giant reed), ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'' (papyrus), ''[[Phragmites]]'' (reed) and ''[[Typha]]'' (cattail, bulrush).

Wetlands naturally produce an array of vegetation and other ecological products that can be harvested for personal and commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Waterlogged wealth: why waste the world's wet places?|last=Maltby|first=Edward|date=1986|publisher=International Institute for Environment and Development|others=Earthscan.|isbn=978-0905347639|location=London|oclc=18834448}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most significant of these is fish which have all or part of their life-cycle occur within a wetland system. Fresh and saltwater fish are the main source of protein for one billion people and comprise 15% of an additional two billion people's diets. In addition, fish generate a fishing industry that provides 80% of the income and employment to residents in developing countries. Another food staple found in wetland systems is rice, a popular grain that is consumed at the rate of one fifth of the total global calorie count. In Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam, where rice paddies are predominant on the landscape, rice consumption reach 70%.&lt;ref name="ramsar b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-info/main/ramsar/1-31-59_4000_0__|title=The Ramsar Information Sheet on Wetlands of International Importance|date=September 18, 2009|accessdate=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some native wetland plants in the Caribbean and Australia are harvested sustainably for medicinal compounds; these include the red mangrove (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]'') which possesses antibacterial, wound-healing, anti-ulcer effects, and antioxidant properties.&lt;ref name="ramsar b" /&gt;

Food converted to sweeteners and carbohydrates include the [[Cycas revoluta|sago palm]] of Asia and Africa (cooking oil), the [[nipa palm]] of Asia (sugar, vinegar, alcohol, and fodder) and honey collection from mangroves. More than supplemental dietary intake, this produce sustains entire villages. Coastal Thailand villages earn the key portion of their income from sugar production while the country of Cuba relocates more than 30,000 hives each year to track the seasonal flowering of the mangrove ''[[Avicennia]]''.

Other mangrove-derived products:

* Fuelwood
* Salt (produced by evaporating seawater)
* Animal fodder
* Traditional medicines (e.g. from mangrove bark)
* Fibers for textiles
* Dyes and tannins

'''Human impact:''' Over-fishing is the major problem for sustainable use of wetlands. Concerns are developing over certain aspects of farm fishing, which uses natural waterways to harvest fish for human consumption and pharmaceuticals. This practice has become especially popular in Asia and the South Pacific. Its impact upon much larger waterways downstream has negatively affected many small island developing states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/static?%20dom=root&amp;xml=index.xml] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aquaculture]] is continuing to develop rapidly throughout the Asia-Pacific region specifically in China with world holdings in Asia equal to 90% of the total number of aquaculture farms and 80% of its global value.&lt;ref name="ramsar b" /&gt; Some aquaculture has eliminated massive areas of wetland through practices seen such as in the [[shrimp farming]] industry's destruction of mangroves. Even though the damaging impact of large scale shrimp farming on the coastal ecosystem in many Asian countries has been widely recognized for quite some time now, it has proved difficult to check in absence of other employment avenues for people engaged in such occupation. Also burgeoning demand for shrimps globally has provided a large and ready market for the produce

Threats to rice fields mainly stem from inappropriate water management, introduction of invasive alien species, agricultural fertilizers, pesticides, and land use changes. Industrial-scale production of palm oil threatens the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems in parts of southeast Asia, Africa, and other developing countries.

Over-exploitation of wetland products can occur at the community level as is sometimes seen throughout coastal villages of Southern Thailand where each resident may obtain for themselves every consumable of the mangrove forest (fuelwood, timber, honey, resins, crab, and shellfish) which then becomes threatened through increasing population and continual harvest.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== Additional functions and uses of wetlands ===
Some types of wetlands can serve as fire breaks that help slow the spread of minor wildfires. Larger wetland systems can influence local precipitation patterns. Some boreal wetland systems in catchment headwaters may help extend the period of flow and maintain water temperature in connected downstream waters. Pollination services are supported by many wetlands which may provide the only suitable habitat for pollinating insects, birds, and mammals in highly developed areas. It is likely that wetlands have other functions whose benefits to society and other ecosystems have yet to be discovered.

==Wetlands and climate change==
Wetlands perform two important functions in relation to climate change. They have mitigation effects through their ability to [[Carbon sink|sink carbon]], converting a greenhouse gas ([[carbon dioxide]]) to solid plant material through the process of [[photosynthesis]], and also through their ability to store and regulate water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=2009|title=Synthesis of Adaptation Options for Coastal Areas|location=Washington, DC |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|series=Climate Ready Estuaries Program, EPA 430-F-08-024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetlands store approximately 44.6 million tonnes of carbon per year globally.&lt;ref name="Chmura, G. L. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chmura|first1=G. L.|date=2003|title=Global carbon sequestration in tidal, saline wetland soils|journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles|volume=17|issue=4|pages=1111|bibcode=2003GBioC..17.1111C|doi=10.1029/2002GB001917}}{{page needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[salt marsh]]es and mangrove swamps in particular, the average carbon sequestration rate is {{nowrap|210 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} while [[peatlands]] sequester approximately {{nowrap|20–30 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Chmura, G.

The ability of many tidal wetlands to store carbon and minimize methane flux from tidal sediments has led to sponsorship of [[blue carbon]] initiatives that are intended to enhance those processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/climate/blue-carbon/2021/|title=More on blue carbon and carbon sequestration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, depending on their characteristics, some [[Wetland methane emissions|wetlands are a significant source of methane emissions]] and some are also emitters of [[nitrous oxide]]&lt;ref name="Bange" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=A.

Data on nitrous oxide fluxes from wetlands in the southern hemisphere are lacking, as are ecosystem-based studies including the role of dominant organisms that alter sediment biogeochemistry. Aquatic invertebrates produce ecologically-relevant nitrous oxide emissions due to ingestion of [[denitrifying bacteria]] that live within the subtidal sediment and water column&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stief|first1=P.|last2=Poulsen|first2=M.|last3=Nielsen|displayauthors=etal|date=2009|title=Nitrous oxide emission by aquatic macrofauna|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=106|issue=11|pages=4296–4300|bibcode=2009PNAS..106.4296S|doi=10.1073/pnas.0808228106|pmid=19255427|pmc=2651200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus may also be influencing nitrous oxide production within some wetlands.

===Peatswamps in Southeast Asia===
In Southeast Asia, [[peatswamp forests]] and soils are being drained, burnt, mined, and overgrazed, contributing severely to climate change.&lt;ref name="wetlands"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wetlands.org/|title=Wetlands International works to sustain and restore wetlands for people and biodiversity|publisher=Wetlands International|accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of peat drainage, the organic carbon that was built up over thousands of years and is normally under water is suddenly exposed to the air. It decomposes and turns into [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is released into the atmosphere. Peat fires cause the same process to occur and in addition create enormous clouds of smoke that cross international borders, such as happens every year in Southeast Asia. While peatlands constitute only 3% of the world's land area, their degradation produces 7% of all [[fossil fuel]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.

Through the building of dams, [[Wetlands International]] is halting the drainage of peatlands in Southeast Asia, hoping to mitigate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Concurrent wetland restoration techniques include reforestation with native tree species as well as the formation of community fire brigades. This sustainable approach can be seen in central [[Kalimantan]] and [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]].

== Wetland Disturbance ==

Wetlands, the functions and services they provide as well as their flora and fauna, can be affected by several types of disturbances. The disturbances (sometimes termed stressors or alterations) can be human-associated or natural, direct or indirect, reversible or not, and isolated or cumulative. When exceeding levels or patterns normally found within wetlands of a particular class in a particular region, the predominant ones include the following&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?dirEntryID=39147|title=Impacts on quality of inland wetlands of the United States: A survey of indicators, techniques, and applications of community-level biomonitoring data |author=Office of Research &amp; Development|website=cfpub.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323993409|title=Indicators for Monitoring Biological Integrity of Inland Freshwater Wetlands: A Survey of North American Technical Literature (1990-2000)|last=Adamus|first=Paul|last2=J.

Disturbances can be further categorized as follows:

;Minor disturbance
:Stress that maintains ecosystem integrity.&lt;ref name="clewell2013" /&gt;
;Moderate disturbance
:Ecosystem integrity is damaged but can recover in time without assistance.&lt;ref name="clewell2013" /&gt;
;Impairment or severe disturbance
:Human intervention may be needed in order for ecosystem to recover.&lt;ref name="clewell2013" /&gt;

Just a few of the many sources of these disturbances are&lt;ref name="wetlands" /&gt;

** Drainage
** Development
** Over-grazing
**[[Mining]]
** Unsustainable water use
*They can be manifested partly as:
**[[Water Scarcity]]
**[[Endangered|Impacts to Endangered]] species
** Disruption of wildlife breeding grounds
** Imbalance in sediment load and nutrient filtration

Wetlands have historically been the victim of large draining efforts for [[real estate development]], or [[flooding]] for use as recreational [[lake]]s or [[hydropower]] generation. Some of the world's most important agricultural areas are wetlands that have been converted to farmland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=G.

In order to maintain wetlands and sustain their functions, alterations and disturbances that are outside the normal range of variation should be minimized.

===Balancing wetland conservation with the needs of people===
Wetlands are vital ecosystems that provide livelihoods for the millions of people who live in and around them. The [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) called for different sectors to join forces to secure wetland environments in the context of sustainable development and improving human wellbeing. A three-year project carried out by Wetlands International in partnership with the [[International Water Management Institute]] found that it is possible to conserve wetlands while improving the livelihoods of people living among them. Case studies conducted in Malawi and Zambia looked at how [[dambo]]s – wet, grassy valleys or depressions where water seeps to the surface – can be farmed sustainably to improve livelihoods. Mismanaged or overused dambos often become degraded, however, using a knowledge exchange between local farmers and environmental managers, a protocol was developed using soil and water management practices. Project outcomes included a high yield of crops, development of sustainable farming techniques, and adequate water management generating enough water for use as irrigation. Before the project, there were cases where people had died from starvation due to food shortages. By the end of it, many more people had access to enough water to grow vegetables. A key achievement was that villagers had secure food supplies during long, dry months. They also benefited in other ways: nutrition was improved by growing a wider range of crops, and villagers could also invest in health and education by selling produce and saving money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good practices and lessons learned in integrating ecosystem conservation and poverty reduction objectives in wetlands|url=http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/wn/w.n.iwmi_poverty_report.pdf|publisher=The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands|accessdate= 2011-11-19|date=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramsar Convention===
{{Main|Ramsar Convention|List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance}}
''The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat'', or Ramsar Convention, is an international [[treaty]] designed to address global concerns regarding wetland loss and degradation. The primary purposes of the treaty are to list wetlands of international importance and to promote their wise use, with the ultimate goal of preserving the world's wetlands. Methods include restricting access to the majority portion of wetland areas, as well as educating the public to combat the misconception that wetlands are wastelands. The Convention works closely with five International Organisation Partners. These are: [[Birdlife International]], the [[IUCN]], the [[International Water Management Institute]], [[Wetlands International]] and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]. The partners provide technical expertise, help conduct or facilitate field studies and provide financial support. The IOPs also participate regularly as observers in all meetings of the Conference of the Parties and the Standing Committee and as full members of the Scientific and Technical Review Panel.

==Valuation==

The value of a wetland to local communities, as well as the value of wetland systems generally to the earth and to humankind, is one of the most important valuations that can be conducted for [[sustainable development]]. This typically involves first mapping a region's wetlands, then assessing the functions and ecosystem services the wetlands provide individually and cumulatively, and evaluating that information to prioritize or rank individual wetlands or wetland types for conservation, management, restoration, or development. Over a longer period, it requires keeping inventories of known wetlands and monitoring a representative sample of the wetlands to determine changes due to both natural and human factors. Such a valuation process is used to educate decision-makers such as governments of the importance of particular wetlands within their jurisdiction.

===Assessment===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Rapid assessment methods are used to score, rank, rate, or categorize various functions, [[ecosystem services]], species, communities, levels of disturbance, and/or [[ecological health]] of a wetland or group of wetlands. This is often done to prioritize particular wetlands for conservation (avoidance) or to determine the degree to which loss or alteration of wetland functions should be compensated, such as by restoring degraded wetlands elsewhere or providing additional protections to existing wetlands. Rapid assessment methods are also applied before and after a wetland has been restored or altered, to help monitor or predict the effects of those actions on various wetland functions and the services they provide. Assessments are typically considered to be "rapid" when they require only a single visit to the wetland lasting less than one day, which in some cases may include interpretation of aerial imagery and [[GIS]] analyses of existing spatial data, but not detailed post-visit laboratory analyses of water or biological samples. Due to time and cost constraints, the levels of various wetland functions or other attributes are usually not measured directly but rather are estimated relative to other assessed wetlands in a region, using observation-based variables, sometimes called "indicators", that are hypothesized or known to predict performance of the specified functions or attributes.

To achieve consistency among persons doing the assessment, rapid methods present indicator variables as questions or checklists on standardized data forms, and most methods standardize the scoring or rating procedure that is used to combine question responses into estimates of the levels of specified functions relative to the levels estimated in other wetlands ("calibration sites") assessed previously in a region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://people.oregonstate.edu/~adamusp/WESP/Manual_WESP1.3_13Oct2016_Adamus.pdf |title=Manual for the Wetland Ecosystem Services Protocol (WESP)|last=Adamus|first=P. |date= 2016|website=Oregon State University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid assessment methods, partly because they often use dozens of indicators pertaining to conditions surrounding a wetland as well as within the wetland itself, aim to provide estimates of wetland functions and services that are more accurate and repeatable than simply describing a wetland's class type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= |chapter= |editor=Dorney, J. |editor2=Savage, R. |editor3=Tiner, R.W. |editor4=Adamus, P. |title=Wetland and Stream Rapid Assessments: Development, Validation, and Application |date=2018 |publisher=Academic Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-12-805091-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A need for wetland assessments to be rapid arises mostly when government agencies set deadlines for decisions affecting a wetland, or when the number of wetlands needing information on their functions or condition is large.

In North America and a few other countries, standardized rapid assessment methods for wetlands have a long history, having been developed, calibrated, tested, and applied to varying degrees in several different regions and wetland types since the 1970s. However, few rapid assessment methods have been fully validated. Done correctly, validation is a very expensive endeavor that involves comparing rankings of a series of wetlands based on results from rapid assessment methods with rankings based on less rapid and considerably more costly, multi-visit, detailed measurements of levels of the same functions or other attributes in the same series of wetlands.

===Inventory===

Although developing a global inventory of wetlands has proven to be a large and difficult undertaking, many efforts at more local scales have been successful. Current efforts are based on available data, but both classification and spatial resolution have sometimes proven to be inadequate for regional or site-specific environmental management decision-making. It is difficult to identify small, long, and narrow wetlands within the landscape. Many of today's remote sensing satellites do not have sufficient spatial and spectral resolution to monitor wetland conditions, although multispectral IKONOS and QuickBird data may offer improved spatial resolutions once it is 4&amp;nbsp;m or higher. Majority of the pixels are just mixtures of several plant species or vegetation types and are difficult to isolate which translates into an inability to classify the vegetation that defines the wetland. Improved remote sensing information, coupled with good knowledge domain on wetlands will facilitate expanded efforts in wetland monitoring and mapping. This will also be extremely important because we expect to see major shifts in species composition due to both anthropogenic land use and natural changes in the environment caused by climate change.

===Monitoring===

A wetland needs to be monitored over time to assess whether it is functioning at an ecologically sustainable level or whether it is becoming degraded. Degraded wetlands will suffer a loss in water quality, loss of sensitive species, and aberrant functioning of soil geochemical processes.

'''Mapping'''

Practically, many natural wetlands are difficult to monitor from the ground as they are quite often are difficult to access and may require exposure to dangerous plants and animals as well as diseases borne by insects or other invertebrates..Therefore, mapping using aerial imagery is one effective tool to monitor a wetland, especially a large wetland, and can also be used to monitor the status of numerous wetlands throughout a watershed or region. Many remote sensing methods can be used to map wetlands. Remote-sensing technology permits the acquisition of timely digital data on a repetitive basis. This repeat coverage allows wetlands, as well as the adjacent land-cover and land-use types, to be monitored seasonally and/or annually. Using digital data provides a standardized data-collection procedure and an opportunity for data integration within a [[geographic information system]]. Traditionally, Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and the SPOT 4 and 5 satellite systems have been used for this purpose. More recently, however, multispectral IKONOS and QuickBird data, with spatial resolutions of {{convert|4|by|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2.44|by|2.44|m|ft|abbr=on}}, respectively, have been shown to be excellent sources of data when mapping and monitoring smaller wetland habitats and vegetation communities.

For example, Detroit Lakes Wetland Management District assessed area wetlands in Michigan, USA, using remote sensing. Through using this technology, satellite images were taken over a large geographic area and extended period. In addition, using this technique was less costly and time-consuming compared to the older method using visual interpretation of [[aerial photographs]]. In comparison, most aerial photographs also require experienced interpreters to extract information based on structure and texture while the interpretation of remote sensing data only requires analysis of one characteristic (spectral).

However, there are a number of limitations associated with this type of image acquisition. Analysis of wetlands has proved difficult because to obtain the data it is often linked to other purposes such as the analysis of land cover or land use.

'''Further improvements'''

Methods to develop a classification system for specific biota of interest could assist with technological advances that will allow for identification at a very high accuracy rate. The issue of the cost and expertise involved in remote sensing technology is still a factor hindering further advancements in image acquisition and data processing. Future improvements in current wetland vegetation mapping could include the use of more recent and better geospatial data when it is available.

==Restoration==
Restoration and [[Restoration ecology|restoration ecologists]] intend to return wetlands to their natural trajectory by aiding directly with the natural processes of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name=clewell2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clewell|first1=AF|last2=Aronson|first2=J|title=Ecological restoration|date=2013|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; These direct methods vary with respect to the degree of physical manipulation of the natural environment and each are associated with different levels of restoration.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Restoration is needed after disturbance or [[Disturbance (ecology)|perturbation]] of a wetland.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Disturbances include [[Exogeny|exogenous]] factors such as flooding or drought.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Other external damage may be [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] disturbance caused by clear-cut harvesting of trees, oil and gas extraction, poorly defined infrastructure installation, over grazing of livestock, ill-considered recreational activities, alteration of wetlands including dredging, draining, and filling, and other negative human impacts.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name="mitsch2007" /&gt; Disturbance puts different levels of stress on an environment depending on the type and duration of disturbance.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; There is no one way to restore a wetland and the level of restoration required will be based on the level of disturbance although, each method of restoration does require preparation and administration.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;

===Levels of restoration===
;Factors influencing selected approach may include&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;
*Budget
*Time scale limitations
*Project goals
*Level of disturbance
*Landscape and ecological constraints
*Political and administrative agendas
*Socioeconomic priorities

# '''Prescribed Natural Regeneration'''
#: There are no biophysical manipulation and the ecosystem is left to recover based on the process of [[Ecological succession|succession]] alone.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; The focus of this method is to eliminate and prevent further disturbance from occurring.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; In order for this type of restoration to be effective and successful there must be prior research done to understand the probability that the wetland will recover with this method.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Otherwise, some biophysical manipulation may be required to enhance the rate of succession to an acceptable level determined by the project managers and ecologists.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; This is likely to be the first method of approach for the lowest level of disturbance being that it is the least intrusive and least costly.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; 
# '''Assisted Natural Regeneration'''
#: There are some biophysical manipulations however they are non-intrusive.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Example methods that are not limited to wetlands include prescribed burns to small areas, promotion of site specific soil [[microbiota]] and plant growth using nucleation planting whereby plants radiate from an initial planting site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corbin|first1=JD|last2=Holl|first2=KD|title=Applied nucleation as a forest restoration strategy|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|date=2012|volume=256|pages=37–46|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2011.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promotion of niche diversity or increasing the range of niches to promote use by a variety of different species.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; These methods can make it easier for the natural species to flourish by removing competition from their environment and can speed up the process of succession.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;
# '''Partial Reconstruction'''
#: Here there is a mix between natural regeneration and manipulated environmental control.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; These manipulations may require some engineering and more invasive biophysical manipulation including ripping of [[subsoil]], [[Agrochemical|agrichemical]] applications such as herbicides and insecticides, laying of mulch, mechanical seed dispersal, and tree planting on a large scale.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; In these circumstances the wetland is impaired and without human assistance it would not recover within an acceptable period of time determined by ecologists.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Again these methods of restoration will have to be considered on a site by site basis as each site will require a different approach based on levels of disturbance and ecosystem dynamics.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;
# '''Complete Reconstruction'''
#: The most expensive and intrusive method of reconstruction requiring engineering and ground up reconstruction.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Because there is a redesign of the entire ecosystem it is important that the natural trajectory of the ecosystem be considered and that the plant species will eventually return the ecosystem towards its natural trajectory.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;

=== Important considerations ===

* Constructed wetlands can take 10–100 years to fully resemble the vegetative composition of a natural wetland.
* Artificial wetlands do not have hydric soil. The soil has very low levels of organic carbon and total nitrogen compared to natural wetland systems, and this reduces the performance of several functions.
* Organic matter added to degraded natural wetlands can in some cases help restore their productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=T. M.|last2=Davis|first2=S.
