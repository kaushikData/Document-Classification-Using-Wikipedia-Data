'''AP Russian Language and Culture''' is a proposed [[Advanced Placement]] course and examination, in development since 2005.&lt;ref name="APPG2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap05_programguide_46836.pdf|title=AP Program Guide, 2005–06|publisher=The College Board|accessdate=August 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is being developed through the [[American Council of Teachers of Russian]], in collaboration with the [[College Board]] and with funding from the [[U.S. Department of Education]] and the [[National Security Education Program]].&lt;ref name="CBAPRHome"&gt;{{cite web|deadurl=yes |title=AP Russian Language and Culture Course Home Page |publisher=College Board |url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/37220.html |archivedate=January 13, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113231114/http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/37220.html |accessdate=August 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AP Russian Language is equivalent to a second-year college-level [[Russian language]] course. Students enrolling in AP Russian Language and Culture are typically in their fourth or fifth year of language study, or have had equivalent experience with the language.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

The exam is reported with a score of 1 to 5. A prototype exam was administered to students in 2010.&lt;ref name="Marshall RLJ"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Camelot|title=Examining the Validity of the 2010 Prototype AP Russian Exam through a College Comparability Study|journal=Russian Language Journal|volume=60|pages=319–331|url=http://rlj.americancouncils.org/issues/60/files/Marshall_2010.pdf|accessdate=August 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''arabesque''' is a form of artistic decoration consisting of "surface decorations based on rhythmic linear patterns of scrolling and interlacing foliage, tendrils" or plain lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Fleming, John |author2=Honour, Hugh |title=Dictionary of the Decorative Arts |year=1977 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-670-82047-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; often combined with other elements. Another definition is "Foliate ornament, used in the Islamic world, typically using leaves, derived from stylised [[half-palmette]]s, which were combined with spiralling stems".&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 236&lt;/ref&gt;  It usually consists of a single design which can be '[[tessellation|tiled]]' or seamlessly repeated as many times as desired.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, Francis |title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-66993-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the very wide range of [[Eurasia]]n decorative art that includes [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s matching this basic definition, the term "arabesque" is used consistently as a technical term by [[history of art|art historians]] to describe only elements of the decoration found in two phases: [[Islamic art]] from about the 9th century onwards, and European decorative art from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. [[Interlace (art)|Interlace]] and [[Scroll (art)|scroll]] decoration are terms used for most other types of similar patterns.

Arabesques are a fundamental element of Islamic art but they develop what was already a long tradition by the coming of Islam. The past and current usage of the term in respect of European art can only be described as confused and inconsistent. Some Western arabesques derive from Islamic art, but others are closely based on [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] decorations. In the West they are essentially found in the [[decorative arts]], but because of the generally non-figurative nature of Islamic art, arabesque decoration is there often a very prominent element in the most significant works, and plays a large part in the decoration of [[Islamic architecture|architecture]].

Claims are often made regarding the theological significance of the arabesque, and its origin in a specifically Islamic view of the world; however these are without support from written historical sources as, like most medieval cultures, the Islamic world has not left us documentation of their intentions in using the decorative motifs they did.  At the popular level such theories often appear uninformed as to the wider context of the arabesque.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 74-77&lt;/ref&gt;  In similar fashion, proposed connections between the arabesque and Arabic knowledge of [[geometry]] remains a subject of debate; not all art historians are persuaded that such knowledge had reached, or was needed by, those creating arabesque designs, although in certain cases there is evidence that such a connection did exist.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 88&lt;/ref&gt;  The case for a connection with [[Islamic mathematics]] is much stronger for the development of the [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] with which arabesques are often combined in art.  Geometric decoration often uses patterns that are made up of straight lines and regular angles that somewhat resemble curvilinear arabesque patterns; the extent to which these too are described as arabesque varies between different writers.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabesque is a French term that derived from the Italian word Arabesco, and it means Arabic style. 

The development of this and related terms in the main European languages is complicated, and described in "Western arabesque" below.

== Islamic arabesque ==
The arabesque developed out of the long-established traditions of plant-based [[scroll (art)|scroll]] ornament in the cultures taken over by the early [[Islamic conquests]].  Early Islamic art, for example in the famous 8th century [[mosaic]]s of the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque of Damascus]], often contained plant-scroll patterns, in that case by Byzantine artists in their usual style.  The plants most often used are stylized versions of the [[Acanthus mollis|acanthus]], with its emphasis on leafy forms, and the vine, with an equal emphasis on twining stems.  The evolution of these forms into a distinctive Islamic type was complete by the 11th century, having begun in the 8th or 9th century in works like the [[Mshatta Facade]]. In the process of development the plant forms became increasing simplified and stylized.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 75-88; Canby, 26&lt;/ref&gt;  The relatively abundant survivals of [[stucco]] [[relief]]s from the walls of palaces (but not mosques) in [[Abbasid Samarra]], the Islamic capital between 836 and 892, provide examples of three styles, Styles A, B, and C, though more than one of these may appear on the same wall, and their chronological sequence is not certain.&lt;ref&gt;Necipoğlu, Gülru, Payne, Alina, ''Histories of Ornament: From Global to Local'', 88-90, 2016, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0691167281}}, 978069116728, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9nACCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88 google books]; [https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/museums/mik/miksamarra.html "Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin: Objects from Samarra"]; Ettinghausen et al, 57-59; examples of styles A,B, and C illustrated.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Though the broad outline of the process is generally agreed, there is a considerable  diversity of views held by specialist scholars on detailed issues concerning the development, categorization and meaning of the arabesque.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa's Chapter 4 gives an overview of these questions.&lt;/ref&gt;  The detailed study of Islamic arabesque forms was begun by [[Alois Riegl]] in his [[formalism (art)|formalist]] study ''[[Stilfragen|Stilfragen: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik]]'' (''Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament'') of 1893, who in the process developed his influential concept of the ''Kunstwollen''.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;  Riegl traced formalistic continuity and development in decorative plant forms from [[ancient Egyptian art]] and other ancient Near Eastern civilizations through the classical world to the Islamic arabesque.  While the ''Kunstwollen'' has few followers today, his basic analysis of the development of forms has been confirmed and refined by the wider ''corpus'' of examples known today.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 24-25; see also [http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/-8220-Style-8221-151-or-whatever-4745 "“Style”—or whatever", J. Duncan Berry], A review of ''Problems of Style'' by Alois Riegl, ''[[The New Criterion]]'', April 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Rawson]] has recently extended the analysis to cover [[Chinese art]], which Riegl did not cover, tracing many elements of Chinese decoration back to the same tradition; the shared background helping to make the assimilation of Chinese motifs into Persian art after the [[History of Iran#Mongol invasion .281219.E2.80.931221.29|Mongol invasion]] harmonious and productive.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, the subject of her book, see Preface, and Chapter 5 on Chinese influences on Persian art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many arabesque patterns disappear at (or "under" as it often appears to a viewer) a framing edge without ending, and thus can be regarded as infinitely extendable outside the space they actually occupy; this was certainly a distinctive feature of the Islamic form, though not without precedent.  Most but not all foliage decoration in the preceding cultures terminated at the edge of the occupied space, although infinitely repeatable patterns in foliage are very common in the modern world in [[wallpaper]] and [[textile]]s.

Typically, in earlier forms there is no attempt at realism; no particular species of plant is being imitated, and the forms are often botanically impossible or implausible. "Leaf" forms typically spring sideways from the stem, in what is often called a "half-[[palmette]]" form, named after its distant and very different looking ancestor in ancient Egyptian and Greek ornament.  New stems spring from leaf-tips, a type often called [[honeysuckle]], and the stems often have no tips, winding endlessly out of the space.  The early [[Mshatta Facade]] is recognisably some sort of vine, with conventional leaves on the end of short stalks and bunches of grapes or berries, but later forms usually lack these.  Flowers are rare until about 1500, after which they appear more often, especially in Ottoman art, and are often identifiable by species.  In Ottoman art the large and feathery leaves called ''saz'' became very popular, and were elaborated in drawings showing just one or more large leaves.  Eventually floral decoration mostly derived from Chinese styles, especially those of [[Chinese porcelain]], replaces the arabesque in many types of work, such as pottery, textiles and miniatures.

=== Significance in Islam ===

[[File:Alhambra (038).jpg|thumb|upright|Three modes: Arabesques, [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] and [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]] used together in the [[Court of the Myrtles]], [[Alhambra]].]]

The arabesques and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] of Islamic art are often said to arise from the [[Islam]]ic view of the world (see above). The [[Aniconism in Islam|depiction of animals and people is generally discouraged]], which explains the preference for abstract geometric patterns.

There are two modes to arabesque art. The first recalls the principles that govern the order of the world. These principles include the bare basics of what makes objects structurally sound and, by extension, beautiful (i.e. the angle and the fixed/static shapes that it creates—esp. the [[truss]]). In the first mode, each repeating geometric form has a built-in symbolism ascribed to it. For example, the square, with its four [[equilateral]] sides, is symbolic of the equally important elements of nature: [[soil|earth]], [[air]], [[fire]] and [[water]]. Without any one of the four, the physical world, represented by a circle that inscribes the square, would collapse upon itself and cease to exist. The second mode is based upon the flowing nature of [[plant]] forms. This mode recalls the [[female|feminine]] nature of life giving. In addition, upon inspection of the many examples of Arabesque art, some would argue that there is in fact a third mode, the mode of [[Islamic calligraphy]].

Instead of recalling something related to the 'True Reality' (the reality of the spiritual world), Islam considers [[calligraphy]] a visible expression of the highest art of all; the art of the spoken word (the transmittal of thoughts and of history). In Islam, the most important document to be transmitted orally is the [[Qur'an]]. [[Proverb]]s and complete passages from the Qur'an can be seen today in Arabesque art. The coming together of these three forms creates the Arabesque, and this is a reflection of unity arising from diversity; a basic tenet of Islam.

The arabesque may be equally thought of as both [[art]] and [[science]]. The artwork is at the same time [[mathematical]]ly precise, aesthetically pleasing, and symbolic. Due to this duality of creation, the artistic part of this equation may be further subdivided into both [[secular]] and [[religious]] artwork. However, for many Muslims there is no distinction; all forms of art, the natural world, mathematics and science are seen to be creations of God and therefore reflections of the same thing: God's will expressed through his creation. In other words, man can discover the geometric forms that constitute the arabesque, but these forms always existed before as part of God's creation, as shown in this picture.

There is great similarity between arabesque artwork from very different geographic regions.&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wade |first1=David |title=The Evolution of Style |url=http://patterninislamicart.com/background-notes/the-evolution-of-style |website=Pattern in Islamic Art |accessdate=19 December 2015 |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the similarities are so pronounced that it is sometimes difficult for experts to tell where a given style of arabesque comes from. The reason for this is that the science and mathematics that are used to construct Arabesque artwork are universal. Therefore, for most Muslims, the best artwork that can be created by man for use in the [[Mosque]] is artwork that displays the underlying order and unity of nature. The order and unity of the material world, they believe, is a mere [[ghost]]ly approximation of the [[spirit]]ual world, which for many Muslims is the place where the only true reality exists. Discovered geometric forms, therefore, exemplify this perfect reality because God's creation has been obscured by the [[sin]]s of man.

Mistakes in repetitions may be intentionally introduced as a show of humility by artists who believe only Allah can produce perfection, although this theory is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic Textile Art: Anomalies in Kilims |author=Thompson, Muhammad |author2=Begum, Nasima |url=http://www.turkotek.com/salon_00101/salon.html |work=Salon du Tapis d'Orient |publisher=TurkoTek |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The future of art in a digital age: from Hellenistic to Hebraic consciousness |last=Alexenberg |first=Melvin L. |year=2006 |publisher=Intellect Ltd |isbn=1-84150-136-0 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Only God is Perfect |url=http://www.geometricdesign.co.uk/perfect.htm |work=Islamic and Geometric Art |author=Backhouse, Tim |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Arabesque art consists of a series of repeating geometric forms which are occasionally accompanied by [[calligraphy]]. Ettinghausen et al. describe the arabesque as a "vegetal design consisting of full...and half [[palmette]]s [as] an unending continuous pattern...in which each leaf grows out of the tip of another."&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen et al, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; To the adherents of [[Islam]], the Arabesque is symbolic of their united faith and the way in which traditional Islamic cultures view the world.

==Western arabesque==
[[File:Tapis de Savonnerie Louis XIV apres Charles Le Brun pour la Grande Galerie du Louvre.jpg|thumb|The French sense of arabesque: [[Savonnerie]] carpet after [[Charles Le Brun]] for the ''Grande Galerie'' of the [[Louvre]].]]
[[File:Царское-село,-Екатерининский-дворец.jpg|thumb|What is called the "Arabesque Room" in the [[Catherine Palace]], with [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] [[grotesque]] decoration.|221x221px]]
The term arabesque was first used in the West in [[Italian language|Italian]], where ''rabeschi'' was used in the 16th century as a term for "[[pilaster]] ornaments featuring [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] decoration",&lt;ref name="Osborne, 34"&gt;Osborne, 34&lt;/ref&gt; specifically "running scrolls" that ran vertically up a panel or pilaster, rather than horizontally along a [[frieze]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuhring, 159&lt;/ref&gt;  The book ''Opera nuova che insegna a le donne a cuscire … laqual e intitolata Esempio di raccammi'' (A New Work that Teaches Women how to Sew … Entitled "Samples of Embroidery"), published in Venice in 1530, includes "groppi moreschi e rabeschi", Moorish knots and arabesques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/35.75.3 Met Museum]; the Italian word uses the Latin derived "inceptive" or "inchoative" word ending "-esco" signifying a beginning, thus ''ferveo'', to boil and ''fervesco'' to begin to boil.&lt;/ref&gt;

From there it spread to England, where [[Henry VIII]] owned, in an inventory of 1549, an [[agate]] cup with a "fote and Couer of siluer and guilt enbossed with Rebeske worke",&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Arabesque":"1549 Inventory Henry VIII (1998) 25/2 Item one Cuppe of Agathe the fote and Couer of siluer and guilt enbossed with Rebeske worke";&lt;/ref&gt; and William Herne or Heron, [[Serjeant Painter]] from 1572 to 1580, was paid for painting Elizabeth I's barge with "rebeske work".&lt;ref&gt;"rebeske" being a now disused version of "arabesque", see OED, "Rebesk". Herne payment quoted in [[Erna Auerbach]], ''Tudor Artists'', 1954; not in print OED&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately the styles so described can only be guessed at, although the design by [[Hans Holbein the younger|Hans Holbein]] for a covered cup for [[Jane Seymour]] in 1536 (see gallery) already has zones in both Islamic-derived arabesque/moresque style (see below) and classically derived [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus volutes]].&lt;ref name=marks&gt;Marks, Richard and Williamson, Paul, eds. ''Gothic: Art for England 1400-1547'', 156, 2003, V&amp;A Publications, London, {{ISBN|1-85177-401-7}}.  For other Renaissance ornament from Henry's court, see also no 13 on page 156, and pp. 144-145, 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related term is [[moresque]], meaning "[[Moors|Moorish]]"; [[Randle Cotgrave]]'s ''A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues'' of 1611 defines this as: "a rude or anticke painting, or carving, wherin the feet and tayles of beasts, &amp;c, are intermingled with, or made to resemble, a kind of wild leaves, &amp;c."&lt;ref&gt;OED, "Moresque", citing Cotgrave&lt;/ref&gt; and "arabesque", in its earliest use cited in the [[OED]] (but as a French word), as "Rebeske work; a small and curious flourishing".&lt;ref name="OED, Arabesque"&gt;OED, "Arabesque"&lt;/ref&gt;  In France "arabesque" first appears in 1546,&lt;ref&gt;Larrouse dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; and "was first applied in the latter part of the 17th century" to [[grotesque]] ornament, "despite the classical origin of the latter", especially if without human figures in it - a distinction still often made, but not consistently observed,&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 34 (quoted), see also [[OED]] quoted below and Cotgrave - Osborne says the French usage begins in the "latter part of the 17th century" but in the following paragraphs describes a development beginning rather before this.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following centuries the three terms grotesque, moresque and arabesque were used largely interchangeably in English, French and German for styles of decoration derived at least as much from the European past as the Islamic world, with "grotesque" gradually acquiring its main modern meaning, related more to Gothic [[gargoyle]]s and [[caricature]] than to either [[Pompeii]]-style Roman painting or Islamic patterns.  Meanwhile, the word "arabesque" was now being applied to Islamic art itself, by 1851 at the latest, when [[John Ruskin]] uses it in ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'', [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/sov/1.html chapter 1, para 26]&lt;/ref&gt;  Writers over the last decades have attempted to salvage meaningful distinctions between the words from the confused wreckage of historical sources.

Peter Fuhring, a specialist in the history of ornament, says that (also in a French context): &lt;blockquote&gt;The ornament known as moresque in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (but now more commonly called arabesque) is characterized by bifurcated scrolls composed of branches forming interlaced foliage patterns.  These basic motifs gave rise to numerous variants, for example, where the branches, generally of a linear character, were turned into straps or bands. ... It is characteristic of the moresque, which is essentially a surface ornament, that it is impossible to locate the pattern's beginning or end. ... Originating in the Middle East, they were introduced to continental Europe via Italy and Spain ... Italian examples of this ornament, which was often used for bookbindings and embroidery, are known from as early as the late fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Fuhring, 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fuhring notes that grotesques were "confusingly called arabesques in eighteenth century France", but in his terminology "the major types of ornament that appear in French sixteenth century etchings and engraving... can be divided into two groups. The first includes ornaments adopted from antiquity: grotesques, architectural ornaments such as the orders, foliage scrolls and self-contained elements such as trophies, terms and vases. A second group, far smaller than the first, comprises modern ornaments: moresques, interlaced bands, strapwork, and elements such as cartouches...", categories he goes on to discuss individually.&lt;ref&gt;Fuhring, 155-156&lt;/ref&gt;

The moresque or arabesque style was especially popular and long-lived in the Western arts of the book: [[bookbinding]]s decorated in gold tooling, borders for illustrations, and printer's ornaments for decorating empty spaces on the page. In this field the technique of gold tooling had also arrived in the 15th century from the Islamic world, and indeed much of the leather itself was imported from there.&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;  Small motifs in this style have continued to be used by conservative book designers up to the present day.

According to Harold Osborne, in France, the "characteristic development of the French arabesque combined bandwork deriving from the moresque with decorative acanthus foliage radiating from C-scrolls connected by short bars".&lt;ref name="Osborne, 34"/&gt; Apparently starting in [[embroidery]], it then appears in garden design before being used in [[Northern Mannerist]] painted decorative schemes "with a central medallion combined with acanthus and other forms" by [[Simon Vouet]] and then [[Charles Lebrun]] who used "scrolls of flat bandwork joined by horizontal bars and contrasting with ancanthus scrolls and [[palmette]]."&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; More exuberant arabesque designs by [[Jean Bérain the Elder]] are an early "intimation" of the [[Rococo]], which was to take the arabesque into three dimensions in reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "arabesque" as an English noun first appears, in relation to painting, in [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]]'s novel ''[[Vathek]]'' in 1786.&lt;ref name="OED, Arabesque"/&gt;
Arabesque is also used as a term for complex freehand pen flourishes in drawing or other graphic media. The ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art]]'' will have none of this confusion, and says flatly: "Over the centuries the word has been applied to a wide variety of winding and twining vegetal decoration in art and meandering themes in music, but it properly applies only to Islamic art",&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford Art Online]], "Arabesque", accessed March 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; so contradicting the definition of 1888 still found in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': "A species of mural or surface decoration in colour or low relief, composed in flowing lines of branches, leaves, and scroll-work fancifully intertwined. Also fig[uratively]. As used in Moorish and Arabic decorative art (from which, almost exclusively, it was known in the Middle Ages), representations of living creatures were excluded; but in the arabesques of [[Raphael]], founded on the ancient Græco-Roman work of this kind, and in those of Renaissance decoration, human and animal figures, both natural and grotesque, as well as vases, armour, and objects of art, are freely introduced; to this the term is now usually applied, the other being distinguished as Moorish Arabesque, or Moresque."&lt;ref&gt;OED, printed and online editions (accessed March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printing==
A major use of the arabesque style has been artistic printing, for example of book covers and page decoration. Repeating geometric patterns worked well with traditional printing, since they could be printed from metal type like letters if the type was placed together; as the designs have no specific connection to the meaning of a text, the type can be reused in many different editions of different works. [[Robert Granjon]], a French printer of the sixteenth century, has been credited with the first truly interlocking arabesque printing, but other printers had used many other kinds of ornaments in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Henry Lewis|title=Decorative ornaments and alphabets of the Renaissance : 1,020 copyright-free motifs from printed sources|date=1991|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=9780486266053}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was rapidly used by many other printers.&lt;ref name="Hoefler Text: Arabesques"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoefler Text: Arabesques|url=http://www.typography.com/fonts/hoefler-text/features/hoefler-text-arabesques-patterns|publisher=Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English printers' ornaments"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plomer|first1=Henry R.|title=English printers' ornaments|date=1924|publisher=Martino Pub.|location=Mansfield Center, CT|isbn=9781578987153|url=https://archive.org/details/englishprinterso00plom|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Historic Design in Printing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Henry Lewis|title=Historic Design in Printing|date=1923|publisher=Graphic Arts Company|location=Boston, MA|url=https://archive.org/details/historicdesignin00john|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of disuse in the nineteenth century, when a more minimal page layout became popular with printers like [[Giambattista Bodoni|Bodoni]] and [[Firmin Didot|Didot]], the concept returned to popularity with the arrival of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], Many fine books from the period 1890-1960 have arabesque decorations, sometimes on paperback covers.&lt;ref name="The craftsman and the critic : defining usefulness and beauty in arts and crafts-era Boston"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Beverly K.|title=The craftsman and the critic : defining usefulness and beauty in arts and crafts-era Boston|date=2009|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|location=Amherst|isbn=9781558496774|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many digital [[serif font]]s include arabesque pattern elements thought to be complementary to the mood of the font; they are also often sold as separate designs.&lt;ref name="Moresque 2D"&gt;{{cite web |title=Moresque 2D |url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/2d-typo/moreske-2d/ |website=MyFonts |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Better Out Than In''''' was a residency undertaken by [[pseudonym]]ous [[graffiti artist]] and political activist [[Banksy]] in [[New York City]] during October 2013. Banksy unveiled at least one work of art daily, documenting it on both a dedicated website and an [[Instagram]] account. The majority of the works were [[stencil graffiti]] and chiefly political, a distinctive characteristic of Banksy. Other pieces and multimedia exhibits toyed with [[dark humor]] and [[Political satire|satire]].

The unpredictability of the show and Banksy's elusive nature stirred excitement amongst fans, while [[Defacement (vandalism)|defacement]] from competing street artists and vandals became an imminent problem. While Banksy's works were inherently illegal, no official complaints were reported to the police; most property owners praised the art and some took measures to protect it. The month-long residency drew controversy amongst some locals for its more politically strong pieces, and received mixed reviews from critics. 

An HBO documentary film covering this period and residency titled ''[[Banksy Does New York]]'' was released in 2014.

==Background==
On 1 October 2013, Banksy announced on his website that he would be attempting to host a show in New York City for the entire month. This came after posters promoting an October event started showing up in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vankin|first=Deborah|title=Banksy show to take place in New York -- but where is Banksy now?|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-banksy-chinatown-but-where-is-banksy-now20131001,0,6799862.story|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=21 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes_announcement&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryzik|first=Melena|title=Banksy Announces a Monthlong Show on the Streets of New York|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/banksy-announces-a-monthlong-show-on-the-streets-of-new-york/|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=21 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title ''Better Out Than In'' is a reference to a quote by [[impressionist]] [[Paul Cézanne]], "All pictures painted inside, in the studio, will never be as good as those done outside."&lt;ref name=cbs_lookout&gt;{{cite web|title=New Yorkers On The Lookout For Banksy Street Art Creations|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/10/06/new-yorkers-on-the-lookout-for-banksy-street-art-creations/|work=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Village Voice]]'', Banksy said "New York calls to graffiti writers like a dirty old lighthouse. We all want to prove ourselves here," and that he chose it for the high foot traffic and hiding places.&lt;ref name=village_interview&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Keegan|title=Village Voice Exclusive: An Interview With Banksy, Street Art Cult Hero, International Man of Mystery|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-10-09/art/banksy-better-out-than-in-new-york-residency-street-art-graffiti/full/|work=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works Banksy has included in ''Better Out Than In'' primarily consist of [[stencil graffiti]], much of which are political in nature. His first installment, which he captioned "the street is in play", depicted a child reaching for a bottle of spray paint on a sign reading "graffiti is a crime".&lt;ref name=usnews&gt;{{cite web|last=Sneed|first=Tierney|title=So How Is Banksy's New York Street Art Spree Going?|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/10/08/so-how-is-banksys-new-york-street-art-spree-going|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sign was stolen and later replaced by [[Queens]]-based graffiti group [[Smart Crew]] with a new sign that read "street art is a crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chung|first=Jen|title=Smart Crew Sorta Recreated Banksy's Stencil After Sign Was "Stolen"|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/smart_crew_sorta_recreated_banksys.php#photo-2|work=[[Gothamist]]|accessdate=20 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000804/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/smart_crew_sorta_recreated_banksys.php#photo-2|archivedate=5 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of his other works, the piece has audio accompaniment that can be heard either on the website or by calling a toll-free 800 number.&lt;ref name=nydaily_les&gt;{{cite news|last=Stebner|first=Beth|title=Street artist Banksy gets political in latest Lower East Side work|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/banksy-political-latest-les-work-article-1.1480889|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], Banksy's fifth work was housed in a delivery truck as a "mobile garden," which included [[theatrical property]] showing a rainbow, waterfall, and butterflies. The following day Banksy posted a photo of a tracking device he found under the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Li|first=Shirley|title=Banksy watch: The street artist's latest works -- and defacements|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/10/11/banksy-street-art-new-york-tour/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zeveloff|first=Julie|title=Banksy's 5th Work In New York Will Be A 'Mobile Waterfall' Inside A Delivery Truck|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/banksy-garden-inside-a-delivery-truck-2013-10|work=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banksy's installments are located all across the [[Borough (New York City)|five boroughs]], with some being purely [[Multimedia art|multimedia exhibits]]. On 6 October, as a way to have made an installment in [[Dumbo, Brooklyn]], a primary arts district of the city, Banksy posted a video featuring the [[Walt Disney]] character [[Dumbo]] being shot down by [[Syrian]] rebels, the meaning behind which puzzled many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunning|first=Jennifer|title=Banksy kills Dumbo in new video showing Syrian rebels shooting down elephant|url=http://www.cbc.ca/newsblogs/yourcommunity/2013/10/banksy-kills-dumbo-in-new-video-showing-syrian-rebels-shooting-down-elephant.html|work=CBC News|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:"Hammer Boy" Banksy in Upper West Side October 2013.jpg|thumb|left|''Hammer Boy'' was the 20th installment, located on the [[Upper West Side]]. Utilizing an existing [[siamese connection]] fire hydrant, it depicts a child playing a [[high striker]].]]

On 9 October, Banksy unveiled one of the more elaborate and politically strong pieces of the series. It featured armed soldiers and horses spray-painted on a car and trailer in an empty lot in the Lower East Side.

Banksy extended his work beyond the canvas and city street with other political statements, including on 16 October, when he crafted a giant [[fiberglass]] sculpture of [[Ronald McDonald]], with a real live Banksy assistant shining its shoes. It was unveiled in [[the Bronx]] but was moved outside of a different [[McDonald's]] restaurant across the city around lunch time for several days. The work criticized the "heavy labor required to sustain the polished image of a mega-corporation", as the narrator of the audio accompaniment put it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant |first=Drew |url=http://observer.com/2013/10/banksys-ronald-mcdonald-statue-and-live-shoeshine-boy-take-manhattan/ |title=Banksy Unveils 'Shoeshine Boy' at McDonald's &amp;#124; The New York Observer |publisher=[[The New York Observer]]|date=16 October 2013 |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jeane MacIntosh, Larry Celona and Bruce Golding |url=https://nypost.com/2013/10/16/banksy-clowns-around-in-new-work/ |title=Banksy zings McDonald’s &amp;#124; New York Post |publisher=New York Post |date=16 October 2013 |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 October there was a pair of paintings that Banksy collaborated on with Os Gemeos depicting a single soldier amongst masked citizens and vice versa. "The audio commentary Banksy provided suggests that this piece functions both as situational criticism of the art world as well as a tribute to the Occupy movement. Yet it also recognizes that the installation may be unsuccessful at actually advancing any agenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Banksy In New York|last = Mock|first = Ray|publisher = Carnage NYC|year = |isbn = 978-0-9906437-0-8|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banksy's second trip to the [[South Bronx]] was on 21 October and resulted in a piece depicting a child spray-painting the words "Ghetto 4 Life" on a wall, while a butler waited on him with a platter of spray paints. The work immediately drew a crowd from fans, despite angering many residents, who found the message offensive.&lt;ref name=independent_bronx&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyatt|first=Daisy|title=Banksy upsets Bronx residents with 'Ghetto 4 Life' graffiti|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/banksy-upsets-bronx-residents-with-ghetto-4-life-graffiti-8898535.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2 November 2013|location=London|date=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=daily_bronx&gt;{{cite news|last=Scarborough|first=Joey|title=Banksy’s latest work annoys Bronx residents|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/banksy-ghetto-4-life-work-offends-article-1.1492198|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sphinx sculpture appeared on a worksite in [[Willets Point, Queens|Willets Point]] on 22 October, entitled ''Everything but the kitchen sphinx'', and was quickly swarmed by eager Banksy fans. The attention caught the workers interest, who were reportedly selling bricks for $100 each, and onlookers watched as it was loaded into a truck and taken away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/22/who_owns_the_queens_banksy_sculptur.php#photo-1|title=Who "Owns" The Queens Banksy Sculpture?|work=Gothamist|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesledger.com/stories/2015/22/banksy_2015_05_29_q.html|title=A Queens’ creation by street artist Banksy resurfaces in New York|work=TimesLedger|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fate of this piece was heavily chronicled by the HBO documentary ''[[Banksy Does New York]]'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2014/11/things-we-learned-from-the-banksy-takes-new-york-hbo-documentary/sphinx|title=15 Things We Learned From the "Banksy Does New York" HBO Documentary The Sphinx piece at Willets Point in Queens was lifted by mechanics in the area who were about to lose their business.|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was taken from its original site, kept in a garage and later appeared in the Art Miami New York modern art fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesledger.com/stories/2015/22/banksy_2015_05_29_q.html|title=A Queens’ creation by street artist Banksy resurfaces in New York|work=TimesLedger|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:"Waiting in Vain" Banksy in Hells Kitchen October 2013.jpg|thumb|left|''Waiting in Vain'', Banksy's 24th installment outside a [[Hustler Club]] in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]].]]

The 23rd installment was cancelled due to police activity, according to Banksy's official website, which stirred rumors that he had come under arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yakas|first=Ben|title=Today's New Banksy Was...Cancelled By Police Activity|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/23/photos_new_banksy_piece_goes_up_in.php|work=Gothamist|accessdate=3 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026041501/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/23/photos_new_banksy_piece_goes_up_in.php|archivedate=26 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, an outlined canvas with the caption "Better Out Than In #AnonymousGuestbook" appeared on a building in [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]]. The idea of an open-canvas collaborative piece was presented to Banksy two weeks prior by a community art director. The story then led many to believe the "anonymous guestbook" was outlined by Banksy himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein|first=Sasha|title=Banksy gets help from budding Michelangelos with Red Hook Art Project|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/red-hook-kids-pitch-bansky-article-1.1494689|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this was later debunked to have been the work of a group under the name Anonymous Guestbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cush|first=Andy|title=SORRY, THE "ANONYMOUS GUESTBOOK" ISN’T BANKSY|url=http://animalnewyork.com/2013/sorry-the-anonymous-guestbook-isnt-banksy/|work=Animal New York|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Waiting in Vain'' was the show's 24th installment.

The 25th piece came suitably [[Halloween]]-themed. Located on the [[Bowery]], it exhibited a [[Grim Reaper]] riding a [[bumper car]] in circles to an elaborate light show, [[fog machine]] and [[Blue Öyster Cult]]'s "[[(Don't Fear) The Reaper]]."&lt;ref name=daily_reaper&gt;{{cite news|last=Stebner|first=Beth|title=Banksy on the Bowery: Artist debuts spooky Grim Reaper that thrills New Yorkers|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/banksy-bowery-artist-debuts-spooky-grim-reaper-article-1.1497493|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying audio guide offered a self-mocking interpretation, with Banksy stating that often "the role of art is to remind us of our mortality," implying that with this mounted art show that goes on "for so long we wish we were dead already."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dodero |first=Camille |title=Banksy's Newest NYC Installation: The Grim Reaper in a Bumper Car |url=http://gawker.com/banksys-newest-nyc-installation-the-grim-reaper-in-a-1452430639 |work=[[Gawker]] |accessdate=3 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030090617/http://gawker.com/banksys-newest-nyc-installation-the-grim-reaper-in-a-1452430639 |archivedate=30 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site of the exhibit was once that of an antique shop, some remains of which were placed in a coffin that occupied the lot for months. This prompted other interpretations of the installation's message, paying homage to the "ghosts of Bowry," as the antique store owner suggested.&lt;ref name=daily_reaper /&gt;

The 27 October piece was a message on a wall in Greenpoint that read "This site contains blocked messages." It made reference to an unpublished column Banksy had submitted to ''[[The New York Times]]''. The controversial essay criticized the city's decision in approving the [[One World Trade Center]], which he described as "vanilla" and looking like "something they would build in Canada."&lt;ref name=cnn_wtc&gt;{{cite news|last=Draznin|first=Haley|title=Banksy calls One World Trade Center a "betrayal"|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/28/us/banksy-world-trade-center-editorial/index.html|work=CNN|accessdate=3 November 2013|date=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moya-Smith|first=Simon|title=British street artist Banksy trashes design of One World Trade Center|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/27/21194968-british-street-artist-banksy-trashes-design-of-one-world-trade-center|work=[[NBC News]]|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what became his second reference to the [[September 11 attacks]], Banksy argued the building was a betrayal to everyone who lost their lives that day, and that its blandness is a sign the terrorist won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=Connor|title=Banksy Really Hates the New World Trade Center Building|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/10/banksy-really-hates-new-world-trade-center-building/70980/|work=[[The Atlantic Wire]]|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final piece of the month-long series was a group of balloons that together read "BANKSY!", tied to the wall of a building alongside the [[Long Island Expressway]] in Queens. Banksy included the message "Save [[5 Pointz|5pointz]]" in the caption for the piece on his website, referring to 5 Pointz, a nearby outdoor art exhibit considered to be a focal point of such culture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boyette|first=Chris|title=Banksy bids farewell to New York with balloons|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/31/us/new-york-banksy-residency-ends/|work=CNN|accessdate=3 November 2013|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had recently been approved by the [[New York City Department of City Planning]] to be [[5 Pointz#Demolition plans|demolished]] to make way for condominiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5Pointz Not Alone: City Planning Commission Also Approves Huge Hallets Point Project|url=http://queens.brownstoner.com/2013/08/the-city-planning-commission-votes-for-big-changes-in-queens-today/|work=brownstoner.com|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
[[File:"Ghetto 4 Life" Banksy in South Bronx October 2013.jpg|thumb|right|Banksy's 21 October piece in the [[South Bronx]] angered many residents and graffiti artists.]]
[[The Bronx|Bronx]] [[Borough President]] [[Rubén Díaz, Jr.]] called Banksy a "modern-day Picasso" and praised him for choosing to unveil his 16 October Ronald McDonald replica in the South Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlson|first=Jen|title=Photos, Video: Banksy's New Piece Is A Traveling Ronald McDonald Statue|url=http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/photos_ronald_mcdonald.php|work=Gothamist|accessdate=3 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019220758/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/photos_ronald_mcdonald.php|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=daily_bronx2&gt;{{cite news|last=Scarborough|first=Joey|title=Borough President Ruben Diaz disses Banksy one day after ‘Ghetto 4 Life’ slur|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-borough-president-reviles-banksy-article-1.1493215|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came before Banksy's 21 October piece, which brought discontent to the President and other residents. The piece featured a child spray-painting the words "Ghetto 4 Life" on a wall. Díaz stated it reinforced "outdated negative stereotypes," and defended that Banksy should become aware that graffiti art and culture originated in the Bronx.&lt;ref name=independent_bronx /&gt;&lt;ref name=daily_bronx2 /&gt; The owner of the graffitied wall and his partner, however, praised the work and its message, calling it "beautiful" and owning its preservation to the artist's fame.&lt;ref name=daily_bronx /&gt;&lt;ref name=daily_bronx2 /&gt;

Banksy's [[op-ed]] article about One World Trade Center, posted on his website on 27 October, came as an insult to many across the city. Former [[FDNY]] Deputy Chief Jim Riches wrote that it was a "disgrace to New York City and all the families who lost loved ones on 9/11."&lt;ref name=cnn_wtc /&gt; [[Sally Regenhard]], a leading voice for families of [[Casualties of the September 11 attacks|11 September victims]], expressed concerns about Banksy's 15 October depiction of the Twin Towers in TriBeCa, saying the piece was "horrific" and that the placed flower looked more like an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blau|first=Reuven|title=Banksy criticizes 1 World Trade Center as ‘Canadian,’ ‘vanilla’|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/banksy-disses-1-wtc-canadian-vanilla-article-1.1498564|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Century 21 (department store)|Century 21]] department store near [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] had planned to show Banksy's work on 29 October, but cancelled due to the controversy.&lt;ref name=cnn_wtc /&gt;

Banksy's ''Better Out Than In'' series has received mixed reviews.&lt;ref name=npr_review&gt;{{cite web|last=Rose|first=Joel|title=Art Or Act?

''[[New York City|New York]]'' magazine art critic [[Jerry Saltz]] wrote Banksy's well-executed work stood out from other graffiti, but that the meaning behind the pieces aren't as deep as fans like to believe.&lt;ref name=npr_review /&gt; "No other graffiti artist has a [[Public relations|PR]] machine remotely like Banksy's," he writes, arguing Banksy is more of a "promo man" than an artist.&lt;ref name=saltz_ranking&gt;{{cite web|last=Saltz|first=Jerry|title=Jerry Saltz Ranks Banksy’s New York City (So-Called) Artistic Works|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/saltz-ranking-banksys-nyc-pieces.html|work=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|publisher=[[New York Magazine]]|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Will Ellsworth-Jones, author of ''Banksy: The Man Behind the Wall'' writes that ''Better Out Than In'' shows Banksy's range of mediums has grown to incorporate multi-media and performance-based works. He pointed out the "wonderful commentary on money and art" displayed with hiring an anonymous salesman to sell Banksy paintings in Central Park for $60.&lt;ref name=npr_review /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33812">One aspect of how women are portrayed in popular culture is a purported rivalry between [[blond]]es and [[Brown hair|brunette]]s. The rivalry is a [[cultural phenomenon]] found in many countries that have significant populations of both blondes and brunettes. In the United States, evidence of a '''blonde versus brunette rivalry''' is common in the [[popular media]] and especially in television and film.&lt;ref name="Reinke"&gt;Reinke, Rachel “Catfight: A Feminist Analysis” Chrestomathy: Annual Review of Undergraduate Research, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, School of Languages, Cultures, and World Affairs, College of Charleston, Volume 9 (2010), pages 169, 174-176.[http://chrestomathy.cofc.edu/documents/vol9/Reinke.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitive events==
[[File:Team Blonde Takes the Field during Blondes vs. Brunettes Powderpuff Football Game.jpg|thumb|Team Blonde during the 2011 Blondes vs. Brunettes Charity Powderpuff Football game]]

An example of a competitive event are the blonde vs. brunette [[chess]] matches that began in 2011 as part of the [[World Chess Tournament]] held in [[Moscow]].  The match was hosted by the [[Botvinnik]] Central Chess Club and featured two teams of young girls, blondes dressed in light colors and brunettes dressed in dark colors. This division is a play on the fact that chess is a game played using light and dark pieces. All of the contestants had to prove a degree of expertise to participate.  The 2011 match, which was the first in the series, was won by the brunettes.  The 2012 re-match was won by the blondes who defeated the brunettes, 36.5-24.5.&lt;ref&gt;"Chess Match: Blondes vs. Brunettes in Moscow" (May 23, 2012) ''Chessmate News'' Retrieved April 7, 2013 [http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=8180]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Blondes Take Revenge on Brunettes"  (May 22, 2012) ''Susan Polgar Chess Daily News and Information.''  Retrieved on December 22, 2012 [http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2012/05/blondes-take-revenge-on-brunettes.html]&lt;/ref&gt; A third blonde vs. brunette chess match, also held at the Central Chess Club on April 1, 2013, resulted in a tie score.&lt;ref&gt;Kublashvili,  Eteri (April 3, 2013) “Blondes and Brunettes tie the match 50:50” ''ChessDom''[http://www.chessdom.com/blondes-and-brunettes-tie-the-match-5050/]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; "It was April 1st and the world’s top chess players were involved in the thrilling finale of the Candidates Tournament in London. But at the same time the Central Chess Club in Moscow was the venue of fierce fighting between Blondes and Brunettes who set out to determine the prevailing color. This was the third match of the ladies. Two years ago Brunettes won, but a year later the Blondes struck back. The third tournament was seen as an opportunity to claim the supremacy of one color over another.
The girls were motivated, exchanging punches round after round, but when the dust has cleared the overall score was a 50:50 tie! The claim of supremacy will be postponed until the next meeting."&lt;ref&gt;Kosteniuk, Alexandra (April 3, 2013) “Blondes-Brunettes Chess Match Drawn” ''ChessBlog.com''[http://www.chessblog.com/2013/04/blondes-brunettes-chess-match-drawn.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The existence of the blonde vs. brunette rivalry in American society dates back to at least 1875 when the first female professional [[baseball]] players were assigned to teams according to their hair color.  Baseball historian [[John Thorn]] notes that blonde and brunette baseball teams barnstormed the country in the late 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Thorn, John (2011) ''Baseball in the Garden of Eden: The Secret History of the Early Game.'' New York: Simon and Schuster, page 191&lt;/ref&gt; A 1924 newspaper article referenced a female swimming meet and listed, among the many events, a "blonde vs. brunette" relay race, that was "Won by the blondes."&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Dorothy M. (December 11, 1924) "The Sportswoman" ''The Washington Post'', page S3.

In some cases, blondes and brunettes on the same team may compete against each other.  [[Anson Dorrance]] the women’s [[soccer]] coach at the [[University of North Carolina]] is known for dividing his team into blondes and brunettes and then having them compete against each other.  Losers have been forced to stand in front of the goal facing the rear of the net while the winners take penalty shots against their posteriors.&lt;ref name="Crothers"&gt;Crothers, Tim (2006) ''The Man Watching: Anson Dorrance and the University of North Carolina Women’s Soccer Dynasty''.  New York: St. Martin’s Press, page 221&lt;/ref&gt; Dorrance, in his years of coaching female athletes, claims to have learned that women are motivated differently from males and that his “blondes vs. brunettes drill” worked with his female team because it was a “matter of pride.” &lt;ref name="Crothers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brockway, Kevin (November 19, 2011) “UNC women find offense in NCAA” ''The Raleigh News and Observer''.

==In the media and entertainment industry==

The most enduring blonde vs. brunette rivalry in American culture may exist in the comic book industry where blonde [[Betty Cooper]] and brunette [[Veronica Lodge]] have been engaged in a mostly friendly competition for over 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;Goulart, Ronald (1986) ''Ron Goulart’s Great History of Comic Books: The Definitive Illustrated History from the 1890s to the 1980s.'' Chicago: Contemporary Books.  Pages 248-249&lt;/ref&gt;  The teenage girls form two-thirds of a blonde vs. brunette [[love triangle]] that is completed by their high school classmate and object of their affection, [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]].  As Archie’s next door neighbor in the fictional town of [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale]], the blonde and blue-eyed Betty Cooper is portrayed in the comic book series as a wholesome, popular, middle class girl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicvine.com/betty-cooper/29-2840/  "Betty Cooper"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Her high school friend and chief competitor for Archie's affection is the vain, spoiled, upper class brunette Veronica Lodge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicvine.com/veronica-lodge/29-2843/ "Veronica Lodge"]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their rivalry they remain good friends.  Other comics have used a similar construct where two girls compete for the affections of a young man and the blonde girl is the "good girl, while her brunette rival is the bad girl."&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Randy (2009) ''The Power of Comics: History, Form and Culture.'' New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, page 204.&lt;/ref&gt;  The comic book industry's blonde vs. brunette rivalry over a male has been replicated in other forms of media, including television.&lt;ref name="tucker"&gt;Cummings, Tucker (November 16, 2011) "Blondes vs. Brunettes: TV Shows with Betty and Veronica-Style Love Triangles."

[[File:Betty vs. Veronica 234.jpg|thumb|Betty and Veronica form one of popular media's most famous blonde vs. brunette rivalries and are two parts of a blonde vs. brunette love triangle that is completed by Archie, the object of their affection]]

In a November 16, 2011 article titled "''Blondes vs. Brunettes: TV Shows with Betty and Veronica-Style Love Triangles''", media critic Tucker Cummings cited several TV shows that featured a "classic war between blonde and brunette love interests."  Typically, she wrote, "... the blonde (is) stable, and typifies the 'girl next door,' while (the) ... brunette, is haughty, and a bit more exotic."&lt;ref name="tucker"/&gt;  Shows cited by Cummings that feature blondes and brunettes competing for a man include: ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' (where lighter haired Pam Beesly competes with brunette Karen Filipelli for the attention of Jim Halpert), ''[[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits]]'' (where blonde Jenny Griffith competes with brunette Rachel Zane for the attention of Mike Ross), and ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' (where blonde Rita Bennent and brunette Lila West compete for the affections of Dexter Morgan, the main character).&lt;ref name="tucker"/&gt;

===Popular examples===

''[[Three's Company]]'', an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[sitcom]] that ran from 1977-1984 also featured a blonde and brunette triangle.  The blonde, Chrissy Snow, was played by [[Suzanne Somers]] and the brunette, Janet Wood, was played by [[Joyce DeWitt]].  The man in the middle, Jack Tripper, was played by [[John Ritter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.threescompany.com/tcompany/www/main.htm  "Three's Company Official Website."  Retrieved September 25, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  Somers and DeWitt were continually faced with media stories that described both an on and off-screen "rivalry"&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;Mann, Chris (1998) ''Come and Knock on Our Door: A Hers and Hers and His Guide to Three's Company.''  New York: St. Martin’s Press, page 108-109.&lt;/ref&gt; between the two co-stars. Both women repeatedly denied the stories and attempted to dispel "...the myth that women, especially blondes and brunettes, can’t get along in Hollywood."&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt;

A different perspective on the Hollywood blonde vs. brunette rivalry was offered up by the dark-haired [[Teri Hatcher]] in a 1994 interview while she was starring in [[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]], "I love that there are no blondes on our show. You see so many shows with so many blondes, and isn't everyone
sick of that?"&lt;ref&gt;Winslow, Harriet (March 13, 1994) "Hatcher likes a blonde-free workplace" ''Austin-American Statesman'', page F33&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time ABC was running the ''Three's Company'' sitcom, it was also running ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', a night time soap opera. The show starred [[John Forsythe]] as Blake Carrington, an oil tycoon embroiled in a love triangle that featured his blonde wife Krystle Carrington ([[Linda Evans]]) and his ex-wife, brunette Alexis Carrington Colby ([[Joan Collins]]).  During the show's 10-year run the women had a number of fights.  The spectacle of two middle aged woman engaged in a [[catfight]] during prime time boosted the show's ratings considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Joan (1999) ''Second Act: An Autobiography''.  New York: St. Martin’s Press, pages 192-193&lt;/ref&gt;  Feminist author and cultural critic [[Susan J. Douglas]] believed that the shows emphasis on the male lead character, highlighted by women fighting over him, confirmed the traditional patriarchal role of men in society.  Notwithstanding, Douglas and other feminists were not only huge fans of the show but were captivated by the sight of two women engaged in a catfight.  Douglas even suggested that in popular culture, the "purest" form of a catfight was between a blonde and a brunette.&lt;ref name="Douglas"&gt;Douglas, Susan J. (1994) ''Where the Girls Are: Growing Up Female With The Mass Media''.  New York: Random House, pages 241-242&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dynasty upped the ante ... On one side was the blonde stay at home Krystal Carrington ... in the other corner was the most delicious bitch ever seen on television, the dark haired, scheming, career vixen, Alexis Carrington Colby ... Krystal just wanted to make her husband happy; Alexis wanted to control the world.  How could you not love a catfight between these two?"&lt;ref name="Douglas"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During ''Dynasty''{{'}}s run, Collins co-hosted ''[[Blondes vs. Brunettes]]'' for ABC.&lt;ref&gt;Terrace, Vincent. ''Encyclopedia of Television: Series, Pilots and Specials 1974-1984''. New York: BASELine Publications, page 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Blondes vs. Brunettes" (1984) ''Internet Movie Database (IMdB).'' Retrieved September 23, 2012 [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446659/]&lt;/ref&gt; The show featured a number of skits that gently poked fun at popular culture's blonde vs. brunette rivalry.  The final skit featured Collins and co-host [[Morgan Fairchild]] in their elderly years offering a toast to each other.&lt;ref&gt;"The TV Column" (May 14, 1984) ''The Washington Post'' page C9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flander, Judy (May 14, 1984) “Blondes battle brunettes” ''Lakeland Ledger'', page 16.

Pitting blondes and brunettes against each other, especially as romantic rivals, is a Hollywood technique that extends back to at least the early 1930s.  In a 1932 interview with an Australian newspaper, Hollywood director [[Dorothy Arzner]] stated that lead women and women in supporting roles must always have different hair color to accentuate the contrasting beauty of each type.  Arzner also stated that blondes were usually cast as the fickle types while brunettes are cast as the more serious and emotional types.&lt;ref&gt;"Blondes versus Brunettes" (August 30, 1932) ''Morning Bulletin'' (Queensland, Australia) Retrieved December 15, 2012 [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55496214]&lt;/ref&gt; Using hair color in the [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]] process, has sometimes resulted in Hollywood altering versions of established characters found in other media forms. As an example, in the 1936 [[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon serial]], blonde [[Jean Rogers]] was cast as [[Dale Arden]] who had been portrayed as a brunette in the Flash Gordon comic strips.  However, since the producers had already cast brunette [[Priscilla Lawson]] as Dale Arden's nemesis, Princess Aura, the decision was made to cast a blonde in the role of Arden to help the audience differentiate between the two women.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Cynthia J. (2012) "1950's "rocketman" TV series and their fans : cadets, rangers, and junior space men" New York:  Palgrave Macmillan [https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9780230377318]&lt;/ref&gt;

Arraying blondes against brunettes, is not unique to the American film industry.  The British film company [[Hammer Films]] produced a 1967 movie that took the blonde vs. brunette concept to an extreme. The film ''[[Prehistoric Women (1967 film)|Slave Girls]]'' (also released under the title ''Prehistoric Women'') starred [[Martine Beswick]] in the role of Kari, the queen of a tribe of brunettes who had enslaved a tribe of blondes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062150/plotsummary ''Prehistoric Women'' (1967)] Internet Movie Database (IMDb)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondo-digital.com/hammerglamour.html "Hammer Glamour - Prehistoric Women"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Their existence was disrupted by the arrival of a male explorer who discovered the two tribes by means of a time portal.  Witnessing the brunette’s cruel treatment of the blondes, he rejected Beswick's advances and was subsequently enslaved himself.  He soon discovered a group of men who were also held in bondage.  He eventually led a rebellion where the blondes overwhelmed the brunettes, Beswick was killed, and the explorer managed to escape back through the portal.  The production has been described as one of the most bizarre films ever released.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"An eccentric and unloved Hammer film that uses a blondes vs. brunettes scenario."&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, Marcus (2011) ''The Hammer Vault.'' London: Titan Books, page 90.&lt;/ref&gt; -- ''The Hammer Vault''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although many countries have used the blonde vs. brunette construct in the media and entertainment industries, the French daily newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' believes that the phenomenon is more prevalent in the United States. In a 2012 article, ''Le Monde'' argued that American TV has almost, without exception, characterized blonde women as having the positive values of purity, goodness, and sincerity, frequently at the expense of their brunette counterparts.&lt;ref name="Leblin"&gt;Leblin, Arnaud (December 20, 2012) "Semaine des lecteurs – Blondes vs. Brunes" ''Le Monde''. Retrieved April 27, 2013 [http://seriestv.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/12/20/semaine-des-lecteurs-blondes-vs-brunes/]&lt;/ref&gt; The article provided several examples:
*''[[Bewitched]]'' – Samantha Stevens, a blonde witch who is the perfect hostess and wife. In a comic twist the actress [[Elisabeth Montgomery]] who played Samantha also portrayed her dark haired cousin Serena, who embodies mostly negative qualities.&lt;ref name="Leblin"/&gt;
*''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' – Blonde Krystal (portrayed by [[Linda Evans]]), pitted against brunette Alexis Carrington (played by [[Joan Collins]]).&lt;ref name="Leblin"/&gt;
*''[[V (TV series)|V]]'' – In the science fiction show, in both the [[V (1984 TV series)|original series in 1984]] and the [[V (2009 series)|2009 remake]], featured an intelligent, humanistic blonde battling a brunette who was the leader of the alien cannibals.&lt;ref name="Leblin"/&gt;
The article argues that in recent years, the American TV industry has begun to move away from the positive blonde stereotype and has begun to portray brunettes in a more favorable manner.&lt;ref name="Leblin"/&gt;

===Other movie and TV examples===
Other '''notable''' movies and TV shows that used an obvious blonde vs. brunette setup or was perceived as using such by the media include:

*''[[A Thief in Paradise]]''. Directed by [[George Fitzmaurice]] the movie includes a [[polo]] match between a team of brunettes and another team of blondes, each attired in bathing suits.&lt;ref&gt;Uncredited staff writer (March 29, 1925) "Blondes Battle Brunettes in Bathing Suits at Polo" ''The Kingsport Times'' (Kingsport, Tennessee) Richmond, Indiana), page 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uncredited staff writer (March 15, 1925) "A Thief in Paradise at Richmond Theater Today" ''The Richmond Item'' (Richmond, Indiana), page 17&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Bachelor (season 14)|The Bachelor]]''.  Season 14 featured [[Jake Pavelka]] as the eligible man and was advertised by [[CBS]] as ""It's blondes vs. brunettes in the first sexy, barefoot football scrimmage in Bachelor history!"&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, John (December 4, 2009) "Here comes the cheese. No, not the edible kind" ''The Globe and Mail'' (Toronto, Ontario), p R-1&lt;/ref&gt; The brief football game followed a dinner held inside a mansion.  Dividing the teams up evenly into blondes and brunettes was Pavelka's suggestion to the female contestants.  Some critics were dismissive of the season premiere's set-up:  "In what sounds like a 1962 frat boy's fantasy, it's soon a barefoot, evening attired brunettes versus blondes football scrimmage."&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, Jacqueline (January 4, 2010) "On 'The Bachelor,' love is in the air for this pilot" ''Newsday'' (Long Island, New York), page B-7&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Blonde or Brunette]]''.  [[Adolphe Menjou]] stars in this 1927 silent film comedy as a businessman who must choose between his blonde wife, played by [[Greta Nissen]] and a dark haired rival played by [[Arlette Marchal]]. Although there is no physical confrontation between the two women, one movie critic headlined the movie's review by saying "Blonde and Brunette Fight it Out in This Film".&lt;ref&gt;Staff writer (Sun, Feb 6, 1927) "Regent Picture Stars Menjou: Blonde and Brunette Fight it Out in This Film", ''Democrat and Chronicle'' (Rochester, New York), [https://www.newspapers.com/image/135170983] Retrieved Sep 23, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the [[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (novel)|1925 novel]] by [[Anita Loos]], the blonde and brunette stars of the film, [[Jane Russell]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]], are friends not rivals, yet the film, as the novel did before, comically raised the issue of sexual desirability based on a woman's hair color.&lt;ref name="tomatoes"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gentlemen_prefer_blondes/ |title=Gentlemen Prefer Blondes |publisher= [[Flixster]] | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'' While the movie includes a well-known fight scene between blonde [[Raquel Welch]] and brunette Martine Beswick, the primary aspect of the "rivalry" was the juxtaposition of an intellectually superior, generous, peaceful, and compassionate tribe of blue-eyed blondes, which Welch was a member of, and a primitive, self-centered, violent, tribe of dark eyed brunettes, of which Beswick was a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cashill|first1=Robert|title=Beauties and the Beasts in Blu-Ray: One Million Years B.C. and When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth|url=https://www.cineaste.com/summer2017/beauties-and-the-beasts-in-blu-ray|website=Cineaste|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1="Rich"|title=Random Movie Club:  One Million Years B.C.|url=http://randommovieclub.blogspot.com/2013/02/one-million-years-bc.html|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confrontation between the two women occurred soon after Welch joined the brunette tribe as a newly found mate of one of the tribe's male members, arousing the jealousy of Beswick.

*  [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'']].  1990 science fiction movie where [[Sharon Stone]] plays the role of Lori, the blonde wife of Doug Quaid, played by  [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and brunette [[Rachel Ticotin]] plays the role of Melina, Quaid's dark haired lover on the planet [[Mars]].  In the movie's opening scene, Quaid wakes up in bed one morning after having one of his recurring dreams about living on Mars.  Lori, who is familiar with his dreams asks him if "the brunette" was there in the dream with him.  When Quaid subsequently travels to Mars, he meets Melina, the brunette in his dreams, who he now realizes is an old lover from his previous trip to that planet.  Melina greets him by looking at his crotch and says "Whatcha been feeding that thing?" Quaid responds "Blondes", in reference to his wife on Earth, Lori. Melina rubs against him and responds "I think it's still hungry." Later, Lori and Melina engage in a brutal fistfight. Quaid, who was knocked out before the fight, recovers, sees that Lori is about to kill Melina and shoots her dead.  Melina regains her consciousness and looking at the dead blonde says "That was your wife?

== Research and studies ==

A number of studies have been conducted over the years to measure society’s attitude toward blondes and brunettes.
Many of the studies have shown that men, especially those of European descent, find blonde women more attractive than brunettes, redheads, or women of other races who had darker hair, eyes, or complexion.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Jeffry A. and Douglas T. Kenrick (1997) ''Evolutionary Social Psychology''.  Oxford, U.K.:  Taylor and Francis, pages 109-140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinman, S., &amp; Gill, G. W. (1978). “Sex differences in physical attractiveness preferences". ''Journal of Social Psychology'', 105, 43-52.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have supported the findings by examining behavior shown in public settings.  As an example, a [[Cornell University]] study showed that blonde waitresses receive larger tips than brunettes, even when controlling for other variables such as age, breast size, height and weight.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Michael, Ph.D., (2009) "Determinants and Consequences of Female Attractiveness and Sexiness: Realistic Tests with Restaurant Waitresses". Ithaca, New York:  Cornell University, School of Hotel Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 interview with [[NBC News]], Dr. Lisa Walker, Sociology Department Chair at the [[University of North Carolina]] said that hair colour "absolutely" plays a role in the way people are treated and claimed that numerous studies had shown that blonde women were paid higher salaries than other women.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Most people would tell you, if asked, that it doesn't matter what your hair colour is. What style your hair is in. They would say whatever is best for your face," explained Walker. "But from a very young age these stereotypes appear. In cartoons and children's programming, we see the way women are portrayed based on their hair. The associations continue through childhood into adulthood.”&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Gallagher, Dianne (October 30, 2012). “Blonde vs. Brunette: Does it Determine How You Get Treated?” ''WCNC, NBC Charlotte'', retrieved November 17, 2012 {{cite web|url=http://www.wcnc.com/news/local/Blonde-vs-Brunette-Does-it-determine-how-you-get-treated-176282771.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013192910/http://www.wcnc.com/news/local/Blonde-vs-Brunette-Does-it-determine-how-you-get-treated-176282771.html |archivedate=2013-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The local NBC news affiliate in [[Charlotte]] tested Walker’s theory by asking a natural blonde to walk around the Charlotte business area, drop a scarf and keep going.  The volunteer did it 20 times as a blonde and then 20 times wearing a brunette wig.  As a blonde, every time she dropped the scarf a bystander picked it up for her, but when wearing a dark haired wig, people simply mentioned that the scarf was dropped or ignored it altogether.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

A well publicised 2011 [[University of Westminster]] study evaluated how men perceived women who entered a [[London]] nightclub as a blonde or a brunette.  The study, published in the ''[[Scandinavian Journal of Psychology]]'', used the same woman and had her dye her hair a different colour for each visit.&lt;ref&gt;Swami, Verin and Seishin Barrett (August 28, 2011) “British men’s hair colour preferences: An assessment of courtship solicitation and stimulus ratings”  ''Scandinavian Journal of Psychology'', Volume 52, Issue 6, pages 595-600 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9450.2011.00911.x/abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;  After spending some time in the club, she departed and then researchers entered to club and interviewed the men who had engaged her in conversation.  The results showed that, as a blonde, she was more likely to be approached for conversation than as a brunette. However, when the researchers interviewed the men who spoke to her, the men rated her more intelligent and attractive as a brunette than as a blonde.&lt;ref&gt;Saad, Gad, Ph.D., (February 28, 2012) “Do Gentlemen Prefer Blondes? Blonde women: Approached more frequently but judged more harshly.” ''Psychology Today'' [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/homo-consumericus/201202/do-gentlemen-prefer-blondes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macrae, Fiona (January 2, 2012)  “Men find brunettes more attractive and intelligent than blondes” ''Daily Mail On-Line'' [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2081156/Men-brunettes-attractive-intelligent-blondes.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Many news organizations covered the story as evidence that blondes were not preferred over brunettes.&lt;ref&gt;”Blondes vs. Brunettes: Blondes Lose, Study Says” (January 2, 2012) ''Fox 4 News'', Kansas City, MO. Retrieved December 30, 2012 [http://fox4kc.com/2012/01/02/blondes-vs-brunettes-blondes-lose-study-says/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elser, Amanda “The Battle of Blondes vs. Brunettes Ensues” ''beautyhigh.com'' [http://beautyhigh.com/battle-blondes-vs-brunettes-ensues/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016 a study by the [[Ohio State University]] was published in the ''[[Economics Bulletin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economicsbulletin.com]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jay Zagorsky, author of the study, the results show that: "the average IQ of blondes was actually slightly higher than those with other hair colors, but that finding isn’t statistically significant." He adds:"I don’t think you can say with certainty that blondes are smarter than others, but you can definitely say they are not any dumber." &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.osu.edu/news/2016/03/21/blond-intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, according to a 2011 survey by the Southern Federal University, brunettes are considered more attractive than blondes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rg.ru/2011/05/20/krasavica.html Исследование. Убойная Сила XXI века.” ''rg.ru'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Casa de Isla Negra''' was one of [[Pablo Neruda]]'s three houses in [[Chile]]. It is located at [[Isla Negra]], a coastal area of [[El Quisco]] commune, located about 45 km south of [[Valparaíso]] and 96 km west of [[Santiago]]. It was his favorite house and where he and his third wife, [[Matilde Urrutia]], spent the majority of their time in Chile. Neruda, a lover of the sea and all things maritime, built the home to resemble a ship with low ceilings, creaking wood floors, and narrow passageways. A passionate collector, every room has a different collection of bottles, ship [[figurehead]]s, maps, ships in bottles, and an impressive array of shells, which are located in their own "Under the Sea" room.

Neruda fell in love with the house upon visiting the area and requested an advance from his original publisher Carlos George-Nascimento, who provided him with the money to effect the purchase. Neruda originally intended the house to be used as a meeting point for writers, and dedicated the place to Nascimento as a token of his gratitude.

Neruda and Urrutia are buried there.

In English, ''Isla Negra'' means "Black Island," which refers to a rock outcropping nearby, however Isla Negra is not, in fact, an island. During the winter, the area is subject to heavy rains, which inspired Neruda to write his ''Oda a la Tormenta'' ("Ode to the Storm"). Isla Negra was also Neruda's inspiration for many other poems.

The house is now a [[writer's home museum]], managed by the [[Pablo Neruda Foundation]], and has become a popular tourist destination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4213">'''"Deep End"''' is a short story written in 1961 by [[United Kingdom|British]] author [[J. G. Ballard]]. It first appeared in the May 1961 edition of ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'' (Volume 36, Number 106)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Terminal Collection |title=JG Ballard Book Cover Scans: 1960-61 |url=http://www.jgballard.ca/terminal_collection/1960-61.html |accessdate=January 6, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in the 1962 collection ''[[The Voices of Time and Other Stories]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Terminal Collection |title=JG Ballard Book Cover Scans: 1962-63 |url=http://www.jgballard.ca/terminal_collection/1962_63.html |accessdate=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''[[The Complete Short Stories of J. G. Ballard: Volume 1]]'' in 2006. The tale is typical of Ballard's dystopian [[science fiction]].

==Setting==

In either a near-future or alternate present reality, the Earth lies nearly desolate after extensive overuse of its resources in order to colonise other planets. The oceans had undergone 'oxygen mining' to electrolytically provide [[oxygen]] for the [[atmospheres]] for the new planets, and in doing so had left only the [[hydrogen]] extract from the water, which escaped the Earth and stripped the Earth's hospitable atmosphere to about a mile high, and ensuring the extinction of most life. As a result, the remaining inhabitants that have not emigrated are forced to live on the drained ocean floors, and have become [[nocturnal]] so as to avoid the scorching heat and radiation of the Sun during the day. The last orbiting launch pads are falling out of the sky to the salt dunes and corals towers that were once the ocean bed, and after the last have fallen, the Earth is truly abandoned.

==Story==

The two central characters are Holliday and Granger, who live in a ‘town‘ near the [[Bermuda|Bermuda archipelago]]. Holliday is of unspecified age (though it is said he is younger than fifty). He decides not to migrate on one of the last voyages to [[Mars]], and instead decides to remain on Earth with Granger, an older man who was once a marine biologist decades ago when there was still some form of sea left on the planet. Holliday comes to terms with the fact that he and Granger may be the only two people left on Earth in ten years time (the remaining others being elderly), but he cannot shake his urge to stay, and watch over what remains of the Earth's life before its inevitable extinction. 

One day Holliday and Granger are in a saloon fittingly called the Neptune, when they see the crash of one of the decadent launch pads falling from the sky. They decide to visit the site, a nexus of saline pools and the only remnants of the [[Atlantic ocean]] - now named Lake Atlantic. Whilst inspecting the large wreckage of the launch station, they come across a [[Squaliformes|Dogfish]] struggling in the shallow waters. Granger fails to see any importance in it, but Holliday immediately becomes attached to it, and using his salt-plough builds it a deeper pool to live in comfortably. When Granger asks of his fascination, Holliday explains that the shark is like an image of themselves staying behind and equates the situation with primordial evolution. Holliday vows to look after the shark, and what he considers to be the epitome of remaining life on the planet.

Whilst bringing the shark food the next day, they come across the pool drained and the shark dying after being tormented by young hoodlums before they leave Earth. Granger tries to comfort an enraged and disturbed Holliday and suggests that he stuff the dead fish to keep with him. Holliday reacts angrily to this, replying: “Have it stuffed? Are you crazy? Do you think I want to make a dummy of myself, fill my own head with straw?”.

The story ends with Holliday’s disillusionment with what he considers the true death of the planet.

'''Dehumanization''' or an act thereof can describe a behavior or process that undermines individuality of and in others. Behaviorally, dehumanization describes a disposition towards others that debases the others' individuality as either an "individual" species or an "individual" object,  e.g. someone who acts inhumanely towards humans.  As a process, it may be understood as the opposite of personification, a figure of speech in which inanimate objects or abstractions are endowed with human qualities; dehumanization then is the disendowment of these same qualities or a reduction to abstraction, e.g. ''[[Automation|Technology revolutions]] cause the dehumanization of labor markets to the point of antiquation.''

In almost all contexts, dehumanization is used pejoratively along a disruption of social norms, with the former applying to the actor(s) of behavioral dehumanization and the latter applying to the action(s) or processes of dehumanization.  As [[social norms]] define what humane behavior is, reflexively these same social norms define what human behavior is not, or what is inhumane.  Dehumanization differs from inhumane behaviors or processes in its breadth to include the emergence of new competing social norms.  This emergence then is the action of dehumanization until the old norms lose out to the competing new norms, which will then redefine the action of dehumanization.  If the new norms lose acceptance then the action remains one of dehumanization and its severity is comparative to past examples throughout history.  However, dehumanization's definition remains in a reflexive state of a [[Type–token distinction|type-token ambiguity]] relative to both scales individual and societal.

Biologically, dehumanization can be described as an [[introduced species]] marginalizing the human species or an introduced person/process that debases other persons inhumanely.

In [[political science]] and [[jurisprudence]], the act of dehumanization is the inferential alienation of [[human rights]] or [[denaturalization]] of [[natural rights]], a definition contingent upon presiding [[international law]] rather than [[social norms]] limited by [[human geography]]. In this context, specialty within species need not apply to constitute [[global citizenship]] or its inalienable rights; these both are inherit by human genome.

It is theorized to take on two forms: ''animalistic dehumanization'', which is employed on a largely intergroup basis, and ''mechanistic dehumanization'', which is employed on a largely interpersonal basis.&lt;ref name="Haslam, N, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haslam |first1=Nick |title=Dehumanization: An Integrative Review |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review |volume=10 |issue=3 |year=2006 |pages=252–264 |pmid=16859440 |doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1003_4 |url=http://general.utpb.edu/FAC/hughes_j/Haslam%20on%20dehumanization.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626110654/http://general.utpb.edu/fac/hughes_j/Haslam%20on%20dehumanization.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dehumanization can occur discursively (e.g., idiomatic language that likens certain human beings to non-human animals, [[verbal abuse]], erasing one's voice from discourse), symbolically (e.g., imagery), or physically (e.g., chattel [[slavery]], [[physical abuse]], refusing eye contact). Dehumanization often ignores the target's [[Individualism|individuality]] (i.e., the creative and interesting aspects of their personality) and can hinder one from feeling [[empathy]] or properly understanding a [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] group of people.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Dehumanization may be carried out by a social [[institution]] (such as a state, school, or family), interpersonally, or even within the self. Dehumanization can be unintentional, especially on the part of individuals, as with some types of ''de facto'' [[racism]]. State-organized dehumanization has historically been directed against perceived political, [[Race (human classification)|racial]], [[Ethnic group|ethnic]], national, or religious [[minority group]]s. Other minoritized and [[Marginalization|marginalized]] individuals and groups (based on [[sexual orientation]], [[gender]], disability, [[Social class|class]], or some other organizing principle) are also susceptible to various forms of dehumanization. The concept of dehumanization has received empirical attention in the [[Psychology|psychological]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Moller, A. C., &amp; Deci, E. L. (2010).

“Dehumanisation is viewed as a central component to intergroup violence because it is frequently the most important precursor to moral exclusion, the process by which stigmatized groups are placed outside the boundary in which moral values, rules, and considerations of fairness apply.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goof|first=Phillip|last2=Eberhardt|first2=Jennifer|last3=Williams|first3=Melissa|last4=Jackson|first4=Matthew|date=2008|title=Not yet human: implicit knowledge, historical dehumanization, and contemporary consequences|url= http://web.stanford.edu/~eberhard/downloads/2008-NotYetHuman.pdf|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|publisher= American Psychology Association|volume=94|issue=2|pages=292–306|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.2.292|pmid=18211178|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Livingstone Smith]], director and founder of The Human Nature Project at the University of New England, argues that historically, human beings have been dehumanizing one another for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Less Than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave, and Exterminate Others|last = Livingstone Smith|first = David|publisher = St. Martin’s Press,|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = 336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humanness ==

In [[Herbert Kelman]]'s work on dehumanization, humanness has two features: "identity" (i.e., a perception of the person "as an individual, independent and distinguishable from others, capable of making choices") and "community" (i.e., a perception of the person as "part of an interconnected network of individuals who care for each other"). When a target's agency and community embeddedness are denied, they no longer elicit compassion or other moral responses, and may suffer violence as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Kelman, H. C. (1976). "Violence without restraint: Reflections on the dehumanization of victims and victimizers". pp. 282-314 in G. M. Kren &amp; L. H. Rappoport (Eds.), ''Varieties of Psychohistory''. New York: Springer. {{ISBN|0826119409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animalistic versus mechanistic ==

In Nick Haslam's review of dehumanization, he differentiates between uniquely human (UH) characteristics, which distinguish humans from non-human animals, and human nature (HN), characteristics that are typical of or central to human beings. His model suggests that different types of dehumanization arise from the denial of one sense of humanness or the other. Language, higher order cognition, refined emotions, civility, and morality are uniquely human characteristics (i.e., traits humans have that non-human animals do not). Cognitive flexibility, emotionality, vital agency, and warmth are central to human nature. Characteristics of human nature are perceived to be widely shared among groups (i.e., every human has these traits), while uniquely human characteristics (e.g., civility, morality) are thought to vary between groups.&lt;ref name="Haslam, N, 2006" /&gt;

According to Haslam, the animalistic form of dehumanization occurs when uniquely human characteristics (e.g., refinement, moral sensibility) are denied to an [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]]. People that suffer animalistic dehumanization are seen as amoral, unintelligent, and lacking self-control, and they are likened to animals. This has happened to Jewish people during [[The Holocaust]], and indigenous people subject to colonization and slavery. While usually employed on an intergroup basis, animalistic dehumanization can occur on an interpersonal basis as well.

The mechanistic form occurs when features of human nature (e.g., cognitive flexibility, warmth, agency) are denied to targets. Targets of mechanistic dehumanization are seen as cold, rigid, interchangeable, lacking agency, and likened to machines or objects. Mechanistic dehumanization is usually employed on an interpersonal basis (e.g., when a person is seen as a means to another's end).&lt;ref name="Haslam, N, 2006" /&gt;

== Related psychological processes ==

Several lines of psychological research relate to the concept of dehumanization. Infrahumanization suggests that individuals think of and treat [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] members as "less human" and more like animals;&lt;ref name="Leyens, JPh, 2000" /&gt; while Irenaus Eibl-Eibesfeld uses the term ''pseudo-speciation'', a term that he borrowed from the psychoanalyst Erik Erikson, to imply that the dehumanized person or persons are being regarded as not members of the human species.&lt;ref name="eibl"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Biology of Peace and War: Men, Animals and Aggression | publisher=New York Viking Press | author=Eibl-Eibisfeldt, Irenäus | year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, individuals associate secondary emotions (which are seen as uniquely human) more with the ingroup than with the outgroup. Primary emotions (those that are experienced by all sentient beings, both humans and other animals) and are found to be more associated with the outgroup.&lt;ref name="Leyens, JPh, 2000" /&gt; Dehumanization is intrinsically connected with violence.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Often, one cannot do serious injury to another without first dehumanizing him or her in one's mind (as a form of [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]].){{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Military training is, among other things, a systematic desensitization and dehumanization of the enemy, and servicemen and women may find it psychologically necessary to refer to the enemy as animal or other non-human beings. Lt. Col. Dave Grossman has shown that without such desensitization it would be difficult, if not impossible for someone to kill another human, even in combat or under threat to their own lives.&lt;ref name="grossman"&gt;{{cite book | title=On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society | publisher=[[Back Bay Books]] | author=Grossman, Dave Lt. Col. | year=1996 | isbn=0-316-33000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delegitimization is the "categorization of groups into extreme negative social categories which are excluded from human groups that are considered as acting within the limits of acceptable norms and/or values."&lt;ref name ="Bar-Tal, D, 1989" /&gt;

Moral exclusion occurs when outgroups are subject to a different set of moral values, rules, and fairness than are used in social relations with ingroup members.&lt;ref name="Opotow, S., 1990" /&gt; When individuals dehumanize others, they no longer experience distress when they treat them poorly. Moral exclusion is used to explain extreme behaviors like genocide, harsh [[Immigration policy|immigration policies]], and [[eugenics]], but can also happen on a more regular, everyday discriminatory level. In laboratory studies, people who are portrayed as lacking human qualities have been found to be treated in a particularly harsh and violent manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|title=Selective Moral Disengagement in the Exercise of Moral Agency|journal=Journal of Moral Education|volume=31|issue=2|year=2002|pages=101–119|url=http://historicalunderbelly.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/bandura_moraldisengagement1.pdf|doi=10.1080/0305724022014322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|last2=Barbaranelli|first2=Claudio|last3=Caprara|first3=Gian Vittorio|last4=Pastorelli|first4=Concetta|title=Mechanisms of moral disengagement in the exercise of moral agency.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=71|issue=2|year=1996|pages=364–374|url=http://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Bandura/Bandura1996JPSP.pdf |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|last2=Underwood|first2=Bill|last3=Fromson|first3=Michael E|title=Disinhibition of aggression through diffusion of responsibility and dehumanization of victims|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=9|issue=4|year=1975|pages=253–269|url=http://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Bandura/Bandura1975.pdf |doi=10.1016/0092-6566(75)90001-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martha Nussbaum]] (1999) identified seven components of objectification: "instrumentality", "denial of autonomy", "inertness", "fungibility", "violability", "ownership", and "denial of subjectivity".&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martha C.

In Psychology higher-order cognitive processes like social cognition may occur between a human and human, or human and non-human, human and object. The assigning that occurs in social cognition suggests a non-human target can have projected internal life, or conscious emotional and cognitive experiences. Mental states projected onto objects and non-human forms of life can occur without intention. Studies by Heberlein, Adolphs, Tranel &amp; Damasio, Heberlein AS, Adolphs R, Tranel D, Damasio H. Cortical regions for judgments of emotions and personality traits from [[Biological motion perception|point-light walkers]] explore the constants of biological motion perception within areas of the human brain, where participants would infer intent among objects which do not have any emotion or cognitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cortical regions for judgments of emotions and personality traits from point-light walkers|date = Sep 16, 2004|publisher = Princeton University|last = Heberlein|first = AS|pmid = 15453970|doi=10.1162/0898929041920423|volume=16|issue = 7|journal=J Cogn Neurosci|pages=1143–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible for subjects to anthropomorphize a spectrum of inanimate objects and non-human life forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwan|first=VSY|date=2008|title=Missing links in social cognition: The continuum from nonhuman agents to dehumanized humans|url=|journal=Social Cognition|volume=26|issue=2|pages=125–128|doi=10.1521/soco.2008.26.2.125|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date = Dec 7, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In children there is a common pattern of projecting the imaginary other, both humanlike and not, and a child is able to interact with the imaginary other without much effort as if the projected other exists. With the ease of anthropomorphic projection, children's lack of social cognition unto human counterparts is surprising. Dehumanized perception often means a cognitive bias experienced through lack of consideration for thoughts, feelings, and general mental contents of a social target's cognition. This dehumanized perception can occur when the target has elicited disgust or further negative responses when in contact with the dehumanizing subject. Humans seen as having certain lower social standings such as people suffering from addictions and homeless persons are often perceived as being low in cognitive warmth and low in social competency reliability. This often elicits more frequent disgust compared to certain higher social standings when projected cognitions by the dehumanizing subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A model of (often mixed) stereotype content: competence and warmth respectively follow from perceived status and competition|last = Fiske|first = ST|date = June 2002|journal = NCBI|volume = 82|issue = 6|pages = 878–902|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.82.6.878|pmid = 12051578}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans can  suddenly consider the mental cognitions of those persons who experience emotions of a social variety, linking in-groups of positive social figures to pride, connecting in-groups of wealthy and the upper class feelings of envy, and experiencing pity towards in-groups of the disabled and the elderly. Through a study by Fiske, Cuddy, &amp; Glick in 2007, a [[stereotype content model]] showed that social targets such as the elderly and wealthy were trustworthy, friendly, and of capable ability due to perceived competence and warmth. However, in-groups of the disabled, poor, persons with addictions, and immigrants were recorded as disgust-inducing due to projected low warmth and incompetence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Universal dimensions of social cognition: warmth and competence|last = Fiske|first = ST|date = Feb 11, 2007|journal = Trends Cogn Sci|volume = 11|issue = 2|pages = 77–83|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.005|pmid = 17188552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilitating factors ==

While social distance from the outgroup target is a necessary condition for dehumanization, some research suggests that it is not sufficient.  Psychological research has identified high status, power, and social connection as additional factors that influence whether dehumanization will occur. If being an outgroup member was all that was required to be dehumanized, dehumanization would be far more prevalent. However, only{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} members of high status groups associate humanity more with ingroup than the outgroup. Members of low status groups exhibit no differences in associations with humanity. Having high status makes one more likely to dehumanize others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Capozza|first1=D.|last2=Andrighetto|first2=L.|last3=Di Bernardo|first3=G.

Neuroimaging studies have discovered that the medial prefrontal cortex—a brain region distinctively involved in attributing mental states to others—shows diminished activation to extremely dehumanized targets (i.e., those rated, according to the [[stereotype content model]], as low-warmth and low-competence, such as drug addicts or homeless people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=L.

== Race and ethnicity ==

Dehumanization often occurs as a result of conflict in an intergroup context. Ethnic and racial others are often represented as animals in popular culture and scholarship. There is evidence that this representation persists in the American context with African Americans implicitly associated with apes. To the extent that an individual has this dehumanizing implicit association, they are more likely to support violence against African Americans (e.g., jury decisions to execute defendants).&lt;ref name="Goff, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goff|first1=Phillip Atiba|last2=Eberhardt|first2=Jennifer L.|last3=Williams|first3=Melissa J.|last4=Jackson|first4=Matthew Christian|title=Not yet human: Implicit knowledge, historical dehumanization, and contemporary consequences.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=94|issue=2|year=2008|pages=292–306|pmid=18211178|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.2.292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, dehumanization is frequently connected to genocidal conflicts in that ideologies before and during the conflict link victims to rodents/vermin.&lt;ref name="Haslam, N, 2006" /&gt; Immigrants are also dehumanized in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Brien|first1=Gerald|title=Indigestible Food, Conquering Hordes, and Waste Materials: Metaphors of Immigrants and the Early Immigration Restriction Debate in the United States|journal=Metaphor and Symbol|volume=18|issue=1|year=2003|pages=33–47|url=http://www.uky.edu/~addesa01/documents/IndigestibleFood.pdf|doi=10.1207/S15327868MS1801_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1900s, the Australian Constitution and British Government partook in an Act to federate the Australian states. Section 51 (xxvi) and 127 were two provisions that dehumanised Aboriginals.
51. The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:
(xxvi) The people of any race, other than the Aboriginal people in any state, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. 
127. In reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth, or of a state or other part of the Commonwealth, Aboriginal natives shall not be counted.
In 1902 the Commonwealth Franchise Act was passed, this categorically denied Aboriginals from the right to vote. Indigenous Australians were not allowed social security benefits e.g. Aged pensions and maternity allowances. However, these benefits were provided to other non-Indigenous Australians by the Commonwealth Government. Aboriginals in rural areas were discriminated and controlled as to where and how they could marry, work, live, and their movements were restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Documents/auscurric/sampleunit/1967referendum/aboutreferendum.pdf|title=About the 1967 Referendum|date=2012|website=Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectification==

Fredrickson and Roberts argued that the [[sexual objectification]] of women extends beyond [[pornography]] (which emphasizes women's bodies over their uniquely human mental and emotional characteristics) to society generally. There is a normative emphasis on female appearance that causes women to take a third-person perspective on their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fredrickson|first1=Barbara L.|last2=Roberts|first2=Tomi-Ann|title=OBJECTIFICATION THEORY.|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=21|issue=2|year=1997|pages=173–206|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258181826_Objectification_Theory_Toward_Understanding_Women%27s_Lived_Experiences_and_Mental_Health_Risks|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00108.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological distance women may feel from their bodies might cause them to dehumanize themselves. Some research has indicated that women and men exhibit a "sexual body part recognition bias", in which women's sexual body parts are better recognized when presented in isolation than in the context of their entire bodies, whereas men's sexual body parts are better recognized in the context of their entire bodies than in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gervais|first1=Sarah J.|last2=Vescio|first2=Theresa K.|last3=Förster|first3=Jens|last4=Maass|first4=Anne|last5=Suitner|first5=Caterina|title=Seeing women as objects: The sexual body part recognition bias|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=42|issue=6|year=2012|pages=743–753|doi=10.1002/ejsp.1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men who dehumanize women as either animals or objects are more liable to rape and sexually harass women and display more negative attitudes toward female rape victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudman|first1=L.

== The role of nations and governments ==

[[Sociologist]]s and [[historian]]s often view dehumanization as essential to [[war]]. Governments sometimes represent "enemy" civilians or soldiers as less than human so that voters will be more likely to support a war they may otherwise consider mass murder.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Dictatorship]]s use the same process to prevent opposition by citizens. Such efforts often depend on preexisting racist, [[sectarianism|sectarian]], or otherwise biased beliefs, which governments play upon through various types of [[mass media|media]], presenting "enemies" as barbaric, as undeserving of rights, and as threats to the nation. Alternatively, states sometimes present an enemy government or way of life as barbaric and its citizens as childlike and incapable of managing their own affairs. Such arguments have been used as a pretext for [[colonialism]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[The Holocaust]] during [[World War II]] and the [[Rwandan Genocide]] have both been cited as atrocities facilitated by a government sanctioned dehumanization of its citizens. In terms of the Holocaust, government proliferated propaganda created a culture of dehumanization of the Jewish population. Crimes like [[lynching]] (especially in the United States) are often thought of as the result of popular bigotry and government apathy.

[[Anthropologist]]s [[Ashley Montagu]] and [[Floyd Matson]] famously wrote that dehumanization might well be considered "the fifth [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|horseman of the apocalypse]]" because of the inestimable damage it has dealt to society.&lt;ref&gt;Montagu, Ashley and Matson, Floyd W. (1983) ''The dehumanization of man'', McGraw-Hill, Preface, p. xi, "For that reason this sickness of the soul might well be called the 'Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse.' Its more conventional name, of course, is dehumanization."&lt;/ref&gt; When people become things, the logic follows, they become dispensable, and any atrocity can be justified.

Dehumanization can be seen outside of overtly violent conflicts, as in political debates where opponents are presented as collectively stupid or inherently [[evil]]. Such "good-versus-evil" claims help end substantive debate (see also [[thought-terminating cliché]]).

== The role of terrorists and rebels ==

Non-state actors—terrorists in particular—have also resorted to dehumanization to further their cause and assuage pangs of guilt. The 1960s terrorist group [[Weather Underground]] had advocated violence against any authority figure, and used the "police are pigs" idea to convince members that they were not harming human beings, but simply killing wild animals. Likewise, rhetoric statements such as "terrorists are just scum", is an act of dehumanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=Stephen|title=Cities and the 'War on Terror'|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|volume=30|issue=2|year=2006|pages=255–276|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2006.00665.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systematic destruction==

A study investigating racialized law enforcement violence is using virtual [[simulator]]s to investigate "shoot or don't shoot" responses. The studies conducted that participants' responses were affected by racial bias. When the simulator presented an armed Black man, participants shot faster and more accurately compared to an armed White man. In response to the "don't shoot", command of an unarmed Black man participant's reaction time was slower and less accurate compared to an unarmed White man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellawala|first=Themal.I|date=2016|title=Pulling the trigger: Dehumanization of African Americans and Police Violence|url=http://commons.clarku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&amp;context=surj|journal=Scholarly Undergraduate Research Journal|publisher=Clark|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center of Disease Control]] statistics on law enforcement killings between 1999 and 2011 showed that American youth of African ancestry between the ages of 15 and 19 are 2.8 times more likely to be killed by law enforcement than the national average of all races and age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjcj.org/news/8113|title=Who are Police killing?|last=Males|first=Mike|date=26 August 2014|website=Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted with predominately White female undergraduates as well as predominately White male law enforcement found that participants overestimated the age of American children of African ancestry by 4.59 years, translating to boys of thirteen and a half years of age would be misperceived as legal adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goff|first=Phillip Atiba|last2=Jackson|first2=Matthew Christian|last3=Di Leone|first3=Brooke Allison Lewis|last4=Culottal|first4=Carmen Marie|last5=Di Tomasso|first5=Natalia Ann|date=2014|title=The essence of innocence: Consequences of dehumanizing Black children|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/106/4/526/|journal=Personality and social psychology|volume=106|issue=4|pages=526–545|doi=10.1037/a0035663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annually, 250,000 children are processed through to adult correctional facilities; this is at the impairment of their physical and mental health. In comparison to children at juvenile facilities, children sentenced as adults are, five times as likely to be sexually assaulted, twice as likely to be assaulted by a correctional officer, and eight times as likely to commit suicide. Implied dehumanization estimated the inclination of excessive force used by law enforcement against American suspect of African ancestry compared to other races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nccdglobal.org/sites/default/files/publication_pdf/justice-for-some.pdf|title=And Justice for Some: Differential Treatment of Youth of Color in the Justice System|last=Hartney|first=Christopher|last2=Silva|first2=Fabiana|date=1 January 2007|website=National Council on Crime and Delinquency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Herbert Kelman, "Violence without moral restraint: Reflections on the dehumanization of victims and victimizes", illustrates how the above dehumanization of Americans with African ancestry is occurring. The apprehension towards murdering human beings is so overwhelming that the victim must be removed from their human status if systematic murdering is to occur. The victims are then dehumanized by placing them "outside the boundary in which moral values, rules, and considerations of fairness apply", the principle of mortality is no longer applicable. To establish others as entirely human, signify the sorrow from their death, despite racial background, as well as our individual relationship with the person. When referring to identity, the death is individualized; when referring to community, the death is experienced personally. The involvement of the bureaucratic apparatus is one of dehumanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelman|first=Herbert|date=1973|title=Violence without moral restraint: Reflections on the dehumanization of victims and victimizers|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/hckelman/files/Violence_1973.pdf|journal=Journal of Social Issues|publisher=Harvard University|volume=29|issue=4|pages=25–61|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1973.tb00102.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human anatomy ==

In the United States of America, Americans of African ancestry were dehumanised via the classification of being deemed as a primate, not a human.  The United States of America Constitution that took place in 1787 stated when collecting census data "all other persons" in reference to enslaved Africans will be counted as three-fifths of a human being. In the 1990s reportedly California State Police classified incidents involving young men of African ancestry as no humans involved. A California police officer who was also involved in the [[Rodney King]] beating described a dispute between an American couple with African ancestry as "something right out of gorillas in the mist". [[Franz Boas]] and [[Charles Darwin]] hypothesized that there may be an evolution process among primates. Monkeys and apes were least evolved, then savage and/ or deformed anthropoids which referred to people of African ancestry, to Caucasians as most evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goof|first=Phillip|last2=Eberhardt|first2=Jennifer|last3=Williams|first3=Melissa|last4=Jackson|first4=Matthew|date=2008|title=Not yet human: implicit knowledge, historical dehumanization, and contemporary consequences|url= http://web.stanford.edu/~eberhard/downloads/2008-NotYetHuman.pdf|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|publisher= American Psychology Association|volume=94|issue=2|pages=292–306|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.2.292|pmid=18211178|access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In science, medicine, and technology ==
Relatively recent history has seen the relationship between dehumanization and science result in unethical scientific research. The [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]] and the [[Nazi human experimentation]] on Jewish people are two such examples. In the former, Africans Americans with syphilis were recruited to participate in a study about the course of the disease. Even when treatment and a cure were eventually developed, they were withheld from the Black participants so that researchers could continue their study. Similarly, Nazi scientists conducted horrific experiments on Jewish people during the Holocaust. This was justified in the name of research and progress which is indicative of the far reaching affects that the culture of dehumanization had upon this society. When this research came to light, efforts were made to protect participants of future research, and currently [[institutional review board]]s exist to safeguard individuals from being taken advantage of by scientists.

In a medical context, the passage of time has served to make some dehumanizing practices more acceptable, not less. While dissections of human cadavers was seen as dehumanizing in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] (see [[History of anatomy]]), the value of dissections as a training aid is such that they are now more widely accepted. Dehumanization has been associated with modern medicine generally, and specifically, has been suggested as a coping mechanism for doctors who work with patients at the end of life.&lt;ref name="Haslam, N, 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schulman-Green|first1=Dena|title=Coping mechanisms of physicians who routinely work with dying patients|journal=OMEGA: the Journal of Death and Dying|volume=47|issue=3|year=2003|pages=253–264|doi=10.2190/950H-U076-T5JB-X6HN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have identified six potential causes of dehumanization in medicine: deindivudating practices, impaired patient agency, dissimilarity (causes which do not facilitate the delivery of medical treatment), mechanization, empathy reduction, and moral disengagement (which could be argued, do facilitate the delivery of medical treatment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haque|first1=O. S.|last2=Waytz|first2=A.|title=Dehumanization in Medicine: Causes, Solutions, and Functions|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume=7|issue=2|year=2012|pages=176–186|doi=10.1177/1745691611429706|pmid=26168442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the patient point of view, in some states in America, controversial legislation requires that a woman view the ultrasound image of her fetus before being able to have an abortion. Critics of the law argue that simply seeing an image of the fetus humanizes it, and biases women against abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sanger | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Seeing and believing: Mandatory ultrasound and the path to a protected choice | url = | journal = [[UCLA Law Review]] | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 351–408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a recent study showed that subtle humanization of medical patients appears to improve care for these patients. Radiologists evaluating X-rays reported more details to patients and expressed more empathy when a photo of the patient's face accompanied the X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Y., &amp; Hadas-Halpern, I. (2008, December 3). [http://archive.rsna.org/2008/6008880.html "The effects of including a patient's photograph to the radiographic examination"]. Paper presented at [[Radiological Society of North America]], Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that inclusion of the photos counteracts the dehumanization of the medical process.

Dehumanization has applications outside traditional social contexts. [[Anthropomorphism]] (i.e., perceiving in nonhuman entities mental and physical capacities that reflect humans) is the inverse of dehumanization, which occurs when characteristics that apply to humans are denied to other humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waytz|first1=A.|last2=Epley|first2=N.|last3=Cacioppo|first3=J. T.|title=Social Cognition Unbound: Insights Into Anthropomorphism and Dehumanization|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=19|issue=1|year=2010|pages=58–62|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/cd/19_1_inpress/Waytz_final.pdf|doi=10.1177/0963721409359302|pmid=24839358|pmc=4020342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waytz, Epley, and Cacioppo suggest that the inverse of the factors that facilitate dehumanization (e.g., high status, power, and social connection) should facilitate anthropomorphism. That is, a low status, socially disconnected person without power should be more likely to attribute human qualities to pets or electronics than a high-status, high-power, socially connected person.

Researchers have found that engaging in violent video game play diminishes perceptions of both one's own humanity and the humanity of the players who are targets of the violence in the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bastian|first1=Brock|last2=Jetten|first2=Jolanda|last3=Radke|first3=Helena R.M.|title=Cyber-dehumanization: Violent video game play diminishes our humanity|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=48|issue=2|year=2012|pages=486–491|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.10.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the players are dehumanized, the video game characters that play them are likely anthropomorphized.

Dehumanization has occurred historically under the pre-tense of "progress in the name of science". During the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis World's fair in 1904]] human zoos exhibited several natives from independent tribes around the globe, most notably a young Congolese man, [[Ota Benga]].  Benga's imprisonment was put on display as a public service showcasing “a degraded and degenerate race”. During this period religion was still the driving force behind much political and scientific action, and because of this, eugenics were widely supported among the most notable US scientific communities, political figures, and industrial elites. After allocating to New York in 1906, public outcry led to the permanent ban and closure of human zoos in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The man who was caged in a zoo {{!}} Pamela Newkirk|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/03/the-man-who-was-caged-in-a-zoo|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-12-08|first = Pamela|last = Newkirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and colonialism ==
In Martin Luther King Jr.'s book on civil rights ''[[Why We Can't Wait]]'', he explains "Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race."

[[Mi'kmaq]] elder and human rights activist [[Daniel N. Paul]] has researched written extensively of historic accounts of atrocious acts of violence against First Nations peoples in North America. His work states European colonialism in Canada and America was a subjugation of the indigenous peoples and is an unequivocal violent series of crimes against humanity which has been unparalleled historically. Tens of millions First Nations died at the hands of European invaders in an attempt to appropriate the entirety of the land. Those hundreds of diverse civilizations and communities who thrived across North America millions of years before the exploits of Christopher Columbus were ultimately destroyed. Dehumanization occurred in the form of barbaric genocidal processes of murder, rape, starvation, enslavement, allocation, and germ warfare. Of the myriad of ways the English performed ethnic cleansing, one of the most frequent was the practice of bounty hunting and scalping—where colonial conquerors would raid communities and remove the scalps of children and adults. This war crime of scalping was most prevalent when maritime colonialists repeatedly attempted to eradicate Daniel N. Paul's ancestors, the Mi'kmaq. Scalping was common practice in many United States areas all the way until the 1860s in attempt to completely wipe out the remaining First Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AMERICAN INDIANS DEHUMANIZED BY DEMONIZING PROPAGANDA|url = http://www.danielnpaul.com/NativeAmericansDemonized.html|website = www.danielnpaul.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compton's Cafeteria riot|Compton's cafeteria riot]] predates the [[Stonewall riots|stonewall riots of 1969]] and marks one of the first times in American history that non-hetero-normative peoples denied their oppressors taking agency by demanding human rights. This incident was a result of the rampant discrimination, abuse, and ultimately, dehumanizing acts of violence against the [[LGBT social movements|LGBT]] community in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|tenderloin]] district of San Francisco. Up until the Compton cafeteria riot, the act of dressing in non-gender binary clothing was considered a criminal offence, and police would respond to "cross-dressers" with frequent violence and misconduct. Accounts of frequent sexual assault, police brutality, abuse of power, and constant arrests by local law enforcement towards those seeking refuge in the ghettos of the tenderloin have been told in the documentary ''Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton’s Cafeteria.''&lt;ref&gt;''Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton’s Cafeteria''. Dir. Susan Stryker and Victor Silverman, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Democracy and "dignity of man" ==

German philosopher and anthropologist of law Axel Montenbruck wrote that dehumanization is inextricably linked with both the "[[techniques of neutralization]]" (David Matza/[[Gresham Sykes]]) and to the obedience aspects of the [[Milgram experiment]] and in a wider sense with [[Philip Zimbardo]]'s [[Stanford prison experiment]].

Montenbruck continues that—in light of our common [[Western civilization]]—dehumanization is based on political [[Humanism]], in terms of both [[human rights]] and Western democracy. Each of them are grounded in the "dignity of man" aspect. Therefore, its "negation" might be seen as dehumanization in our common Western sense. Furthermore, in light democracy, criminal law might be reduced to the simple formula: violating a person means an act of dehumanization by taking "freedom, unfairly and inhumanely". The reaction of a civilized Western society ought to be "taking freedom as well, but fair and humane".&lt;ref&gt;Montenbruck, Axel (2010) [http://edocs.fu-berlin.de/docs/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDOCS_derivate_000000001194/Western_Anthropology,_2nd_ed.pdf?hosts= ''Western Anthropology: Democracy and Dehumanization'']. 2nd edition,, Universitätsbibliothek der Freien Universität Berlin, pp. 60-66,74-75&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
Dehumanization and dehumanized perception can occur as a result of language used to describe groups of people. Words such as migrant, immigrant, and expatriate are assigned to foreigners based on their social status and wealth, rather than ability, achievements, and political alignment. Expatriate has been found to be a word to describe the privileged, often [[Light skin|light-skinned]] people newly residing in an area and has connotations which suggest ability, wealth, and trust. Meanwhile, the word immigrant is used to describe people coming to a new area to reside and infers a much less desirable meaning. Further, "immigrant" is a word that can be paired with "illegal", which harbours a deeply negative connotation to those projecting social cognition towards the other. The misuse and perpetual misuse of these words used to describe the other in the English language can alter the perception of a group in a derogatory way. "Most of the time when we hear [illegal immigrant] used, most of the time the shorter version 'illegals' is being used as a noun, which implies that a human being is perpetually illegal. There is no other classification that I’m aware of where the individual is being rendered as illegal as opposed to the actions of that individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why are white people expats when the rest of us are immigrants?|url = https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/mar/13/white-people-expats-immigrants-migration|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-12-08|first = Mawuna Remarque|last = Koutonin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of examinations of language sought to find if there was a direct relation between homophobic epithets and social cognitive distancing towards a group of homosexuals, a form of dehumanization. These epithets (e.g., ''faggot'') were thought to function as dehumanizing labels because of their tendency to act as labels of deviance. In both studies, subjects were shown a homophobic epithet, its labelled category, or unspecific insult. Subjects were later prompted to associate words of animal and human connotations to both heterosexuals and homosexuals. The results found that the malignant language, when compared to the unspecific insult and categorized labels, subjects would not connect the human connotative words with homosexuals. Further, the same assessment was done to measure effects the language may have on the physical distancing between the subject and homosexuals.Similarly to the prior associative language study, it was found that subjects became more physically distant to the homosexual, indicating the malignant language could encourage dehumanization, cognitive and physical distancing in ways that other forms of malignant language does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Not "just words": Exposure to homophobic epithets leads to dehumanizing and physical distancing from gay men|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2148/abstract|journal = European Journal of Social Psychology|volume = 46|issue = 2|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1099-0992|pages = n/a–n/a|doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2148|first = Fabio|last = Fasoli|first2 = Maria Paola|last2 = Paladino|first3 = Andrea|last3 = Carnaghi|first4 = Jolanda|last4 = Jetten|first5 = Brock|last5 = Bastian|first6 = Paul G.|last6 = Bain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art  ==
[[Francisco Goya]], famed Spanish painter and printmaker of the romantic period often depicted subjectivity involving the atrocities of war and brutal violence conveying the process of dehumanization. In the romantic period of painting martyrdom art was most often a means of deifying the oppressed and tormented, and it was common for Goya to depict evil personalities performing these unjust horrible acts. But it was revolutionary the way the painter broke this convention by dehumanizing these martyr figures. "…one would not know whom the painting depicts, so determinedly has Goya reduced his subjects from martyrs to meat."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Death and Afterlife of the North American Martyrs|last = Anderson|first = Emma|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2013|isbn = 9780674726161|location = United States|pages = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other topics ==

The [[propaganda model]] of [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] argues that [[corporate media]] are able to carry out large-scale, successful dehumanization campaigns when they promote the goals (profit-making) that the corporations are contractually obliged to maximise.&lt;ref name="Herman, S (1988)"&gt;Herman, Edward S. and Noam Chomsky.

''Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-Driven Politics''&lt;/ref&gt; In both democracies and dictatorships, [[state media]] are also capable of carrying out dehumanization campaigns, to the extent with which the population is unable to counteract the dehumanizing [[meme]]s.&lt;ref name="Herman, S (1988)" /&gt;

==Synopsis==

A merchant, after many years of poverty and hard work was forced to move to a distant region and then grew rich.  He decided to go home and tell his wife. On the way he met a man that told him that his road was beset by thieves, and the merchant left with his box of jewels with him until he could get men of his own family to accompany him. On the way there he was robbed and the only thing left was his box of jewels.  When he returned the man at the gate denied that it had ever happened, and threw him out of the shop. The merchant was angry. 

Remington Ram saw him laying dusty on the ground on the road, and asked him what had happened.  Then he sat up and told him to go back the next day, and ask for his box when someone gave him a signal.  While he was waiting, a donkey with a man on top arrived, and the man was told that a lady wished to leave her boxes of jewels with him, for safety.  While the talk was still going on, the merchant received the signal and came to ask.  The man decided that it would put off the lady, and handed over the box.  The merchant started to dance in the street and then was arrested.  A messenger arrived and told the wife that her husband had been arrested, so she went to the prison to get her husband out.  Then Remington Ram burst out of the chest on the side of the donkey and joined the merchant.  Then the man joined them.

Someone said that the merchant had recovered his jewels, that Remington Ram had tricked him, later that day Remington was arrested.  He said that he had thought he had learned every way to trick people, but now he knew another. Remington was sentenced to 5 years in prison.

[[File:האציקלופדיה התלמודית סט.jpg|thumb]]
The '''''Encyclopedia Talmudit''''' ({{lang-he|אנציקלופדיה תלמודית}}  ''entsiyklopediah talmudiyt'') is a [[Hebrew language]] [[encyclopedia]] that aims to summarize the [[halakhah|halakhic]] topics of the [[Talmud]] in alphabetical order.  It began in 1942 and is still an active project {{as of|2017|lc=y}}, with 39 volumes (plus several index volumes) published so far. Over half of the project is complete, and it is hoped to finish it in the following decade with the publishing of thirty more volumes. An English translation, the ''[[Encyclopedia Talmudica]]'' began to be published in 1969.
It is published by the Torah literature publishing group {{Interlanguage link multi|Yad HaRav Herzog|he|3=יד הרב הרצוג|vertical-align=sup}}, named after Rabbi [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]], in [[Jerusalem]].

==Formation of the encyclopedia==

The project began at the initiative of Rabbi [[Meir Bar-Ilan]] (Berlin) (1880–1949), the son of the [[Netziv]].&lt;ref name="sd"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Greenwald |first1=Toby Klein |title=The making of the Talmudic Encyclopedia |url=http://www.sdjewishworld.com/2014/10/27/making-talmudic-encyclopedia/ |accessdate=15 October 2018 |publisher=San Diego Jewish World |date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was first described in a 1921 lecture by [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi]] [[Abraham Isaac Kook]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Yaakovi |first1=Yoel |title=גמרא כהלכה |url=https://www.inn.co.il/Besheva/Article.aspx/6473 |accessdate=16 October 2018 |publisher=Besheva |date=9 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; who outlined several projects for Torah scholars, including a work "that elucidates the essence of Torah principles, organized by encyclopedic entries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kook |first1=Abraham Isaac |title=Orot HaTorah |publisher=Choshen, 1973 |location=Jerusalem |pages=16-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bar-Ilan organized a group of notable editors.&lt;!-- How ironic for me to write this on Wikipedia! :) --&gt;  The purpose was to summarize all the Talmudic discussions and all the opinions of [[Rishonim]] and [[Acharonim]] in encyclopedia articles in alphabetical order.

The first edition of the first volume was published in 1947.  This volume included 219 articles in an organized format of summaries.  The same volume was reprinted three more times: in 1947, 1951, and 1955.  After Bar-Ilan died in 1949, it was republished in a newly revised and expanded edition.

In 1947 ''Encyclopedia Talmudit'' won the city prize of [[Tel Aviv]] for Torah literature to honor the memory of Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hebrewbooks.org/root/data/pdfs/AS/pardestwentytwo1.pdf הפרדס, תשרי תש"ח], עמוד 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Major Torah scholars, both [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] and [[Mitnagdim]], supported the project. Supporters included Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], Rabbi [[Yosef Shalom Eliashiv]], Rabbi [[Yochanan Sofer]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Talmudit'', vol 16, introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrator of the encyclopedia from its founding was Rabbi {{Interlanguage link multi|Yehoshua Hutner|he|3=יהושע הוטנר|vertical-align=sup}} (1910–2009), who succeeded in securing the initiative with stable financial backing, thanks to his connections with leaders of the [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] movement.

==Editors==
[[File:צוות האנציקלופדיה התלמודית.png|thumbnail|Editors]]
The first editor-in-chief was Rabbi [[Shlomo Yosef Zevin]] (1886–1978).  The first editors were Rabbi Benjamin Rabinovitz-Teomim, Rabbi Shimon Stralitz, Rabbi Yonah Martzebach and Rabbi Alter Hilevitz.

In later years tens of Torah scholars joined the editorial board, among them Rabbi [[Eliezer Waldenberg]], the author of [[Tzitz Eliezer]]; Rabbi Isaac Epstein, the judge in the Tel Aviv [[Beit Din]]; Rabbi Yehuda Gershoni; Rabbi Shmuel Kroyzer; Rabbi Refael Shmulevitz, the Rosh Yeshiva of the [[Mir yeshiva (Jerusalem)]]; Rabbi Azriel Levi, the chief editor of the Oz VeHadar version of the Talmud; and others.

The current editor-in-chief {{as of|2008|lc=y}} is Rabbi [[Zalman Nehemiah Goldberg]]. In late 2006 Professor [[Avraham Steinberg]] took on the role of administrative director.

==Contents==
Rabbi Zevin's style was to abbreviate and summarize wherever possible.  In the first two volumes he followed an extremely brief format under the influence of Rabbi Bar-Ilan, but in later volumes published after Rabbi Bar-Ilan died the volumes are more encompassing, and include not only the essence of the article but also many of its details and branched topics.

Rabbi Zevin established the listing of primary and secondary articles and the system of halakhic analysis of the encyclopedia.  He edited the volumes that were published during his lifetime, and prepared other volumes until the end of letter [[Heth]] (ח).

The articles are organized in the following order: definition, sources, reasons and derivations, and various opinions.  The first article was [[Aleph]] (א) and the last to date has been Kitvei ha-Qodesh (כ).  The extent of development in the articles has expanded over time.

There are two volumes of indexes, including an index of topics and of citations from the [[Babylonian Talmud]].

==Other editions==
''Encyclopedia Talmudit'' is also published on a computer version on a compact disc as part of the searchable [[Bar Ilan Responsa Project]].  (See [[Torah database]].)

'''''Encyclopedia Talmudica''''' is an English translation, commenced 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Review Encyclopedia Talmudica by Isidore Epstein; Harry Freedman | first = Abraham M. | last = Fuss | journal = The Jewish Quarterly Review: New Series | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | date = April 1970 | pages = 356–360 | jstor = 1453560}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The founding editors of the translation were [[Isidore Epstein]] and [[Harry Freedman (rabbi)|Harry Freedman]].

'''Ethel Sturges Dummer''' (1866–1954) was a [[Chicago]]-based [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] activist, author, and philanthropist whose interests encompassed child labor laws, prison reform, education, psychology, and conservation. Born in Chicago in 1866 to Mary (Delafield) Sturges and George Sturges,&lt;ref name="Ancestry"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethel Sturges|url=https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/ethel-sturges_186368920|publisher=Ancestry|accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; she graduated in 1885 from the Kirkland School, a [[Secondary school|high school]], in Chicago. She married William Francis Dummer (1851–1928), a prominent Chicago banker, in 1888. The couple had four daughters—Marion, Ethel, Katharine, and Frances&lt;ref name="Ancestry"/&gt;—and a son who died in infancy.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid"&gt;{{cite web|author=Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute|title=Papers of Ethel Sturges Dummer, 1689–1962: A Finding Aid|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00095|publisher=Harvard University|access-date=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she had no formal education beyond secondary school and never held a paid job, she played a significant role in the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] of sociology and in professional sociology in general, according to sociologist [[Jennifer Platt]]. Dummer funded projects she considered important and encouraged professionals to work on them. She often provided to these professionals relevant data gathered by networks of social reformers, many of them women.&lt;ref name="Platt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Platt|first=Jennifer|title=Acting As a Switchboard": Mrs. Ethel Sturges Dummer's Role in Sociology|journal=The American Sociologist|publisher=Springer|volume=23|issue=3|date=Fall 1992|pages=23–36|jstor=27698613|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of Dummer's autobiography, ''Why I Think So – The Autobiography of an Hypothesis'' (1937), Thomas Eliot of [[Northwestern University]], said, "Mrs. Dummer is best recognized in her intellectual enthusiasms, and in her generous tributes and contributions (spiritual and material) to the work of others."&lt;ref name="autobiography review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eliot|first=Thomas D.|title='Why I Think So: The Autobiography of an Hypothesis' by Ethel Sturges Dummer|journal=Social Forces|volume=15|number=4|date=May 1937|pages=584–86|jstor=2571436|subscription=yes|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, she joined the [[National Child Labor Committee]] and the Chicago [[Juvenile Protective Association]], and in 1908, she became a founder and trustee of the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy, later the [[University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration]]. She extended financial support to entities such as the [[Juvenile Psychopathic Institute]] and to prominent psychologists, psychiatrists, and sociologists including [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]], Thomas Eliot, [[William Alanson White]], [[Trigant Burrow]], [[Katharine Anthony]], [[Jessie Taft]], and others. She funded research, writing, and administrative projects undertaken by [[Miriam Van Waters]], a well-known prison reformer.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid"/&gt; She helped found the Illinois Society for Mental Hygiene and served on the boards of the [[City Club of Chicago]], and the National Probation Association.&lt;ref name="Tribune obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Plan Memorial Services for Mrs. Dummer, 87|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=February 27, 1954|page=23|via=Newspapers.com|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/196106850/?terms=%22Ethel%2BSturges%2BDummer%22|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Dummer's published work are prefaces to ''The Unadjusted Girl'' by [[W. I. Thomas|William I. Thomas]] (1923),&lt;ref name="Finding Aid"/&gt; a prominent sociologist and author. Concerned about the unequal treatment of women and men involved in what were known as sexual [[vice]] crimes, Dummer paid Thomas $5,000 a year for two years to research and analyze cases involving female [[prostitute]]s and unmarried mothers.&lt;ref name="Platt"/&gt; Drawn to the work of [[Mary Everest Boole|Mary Boole]] and her husband, mathematician [[George Boole]], Dummer supported publication of Mary Boole's collected works in 1931 and wrote a pamphlet, ''Mary E. Boole: A Pioneer Student of the Unconscious'' in 1945.&lt;ref name="Platt"/&gt;

Dummer's wide-ranging interests included biology, psychiatry, anthropology, and economics.&lt;ref name="Platt"/&gt; ''The Unconscious: A Symposium (1928)'';  ''The Evolution of a Biological Faith'' (1943), and ''What is Thought?'' (1945) were among her other published works.&lt;ref name="Finding Aid"/&gt;

After 1947, Dummer lived with her daughter Katharine Dummer Fisher in [[Winnetka, Illinois]]. She died  in Winnetka in 1954;&lt;ref name="Finding Aid"/&gt; memorial services were held at the [[Institute for Juvenile Research]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ethel Sturges Dummer|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/196110797/?terms=%22Ethel%2BSturges%2BDummer%22|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=February 28, 1954|page=96|via=Newspapers.com|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Falkland Islands status''' is a [[legal status]] in the [[Falkland Islands]] (the Falklands form of [[belonger status]]) defined by section 22(5) of the [[Falkland Islands Constitution]] and the Falkland Islands Status Ordinance, 2007 and is considered to be the closest thing to citizenship that the Falkland Islands can grant.&lt;ref name="sartma"&gt;{{cite news | author=Juanita Brock | url=http://www.sartma.com/art_3618_12_377_2.html | title=Falklands : Executive Council Report for November2006 | work=sartma | date=16 November 2006 | accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2009 Constitution"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.falklands.gov.fk/assets/The-Falkland-Islands-Constitution-Order-2008.pdf |title=Official text of the Falkland Islands Constitution Order 2008 |author= |date=1 January 2009 |work= |publisher=falklands.gov.fk |accessdate=2013-06-29 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112201131/http://www.falklands.gov.fk/assets/The-Falkland-Islands-Constitution-Order-2008.pdf |archivedate=12 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FINN"/&gt; The [[Executive Council of the Falkland Islands]] considers applications for Status four times a year in January, April, July and October and advises the [[Governor of the Falkland Islands|Governor]] as to whether or not they may be granted.&lt;ref name="FINN"&gt;{{cite news | author=Pete King| url=http://www.falklandnews.com/public/story.cfm?get=4645 | title=Falklands First Status Ceremony | work=Falkland Islands News Network | date=24 August 2007| accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the application is unsuccessful, the applicant has the right to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the Falkland Islands]].&lt;ref name="2009 Constitution" /&gt;

The '''huia''' ({{IPA-mi|ˈhʉiˌa|lang}}; ''Heteralocha acutirostris'') is an extinct species of [[Callaeidae|New Zealand wattlebird]], [[endemism|endemic]] to the [[North Island]] of New Zealand. The last confirmed sighting of a huia was in 1907, although there were credible sightings as late as the early 1960s.

Its [[extinction]] had two primary causes. The first was rampant [[Overexploitation|overhunting]] to procure huia skins for [[Taxidermy|mounted specimens]] and their tail feathers for hat decorations. The second major cause was the widespread [[Deforestation in New Zealand|deforestation]] of the lowlands of the North Island by European settlers to create pasture for agriculture. Most of these forests were ancient, ecologically complex [[primary forest]]s, and huia were unable to survive in regenerating [[secondary forest]]s.

It was already a rare bird before the [[History of New Zealand#Early contact period|arrival of Europeans]], confined to the [[Ruahine Range|Ruahine]], [[Tararua Range|Tararua]], [[Rimutaka Range|Rimutaka]] and [[Kaimanawa Range|Kaimanawa mountain ranges]] in the south-east of the North Island. It was remarkable for having the most pronounced [[sexual dimorphism]] in bill shape of any bird species in the world. The female's beak was long, thin and arched downward, while the male's was short and stout, like that of a [[crow]]. Males were {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, while females were larger at {{convert|48|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The sexes were otherwise similar, with orange wattles and predominantly black plumage with a green sheen. The huia was a bird of deep metallic, bluish-black plumage with a greenish iridescence on the upper surface, especially about the head. The tail feathers were unique among &lt;!--New Zealand?--&gt;endemic birds in having a broad white band across the tips.

The birds lived in forests at both [[Montane forest|montane]] and lowland elevations – they are thought to have moved seasonally, living at higher elevation in summer and descending to lower elevation in winter. Huia were [[omnivorous]] and ate adult insects, grubs and spiders, as well as the fruits of a small number of [[Flora of New Zealand|native plants]]. Males and females used their beaks to feed in different ways: the male used his bill to chisel away at rotting wood, while the female's longer, more flexible bill was able to probe deeper areas. Even though the huia is frequently mentioned in biology and [[ornithology]] textbooks because of this striking dimorphism, not much is known about its biology; it was little studied before it was driven to extinction.

The huia is one of New Zealand's best-known extinct birds because of its bill shape, its sheer beauty and special place in [[Māori culture]] and [[Māori mythology|oral tradition]]. The bird was regarded by [[Māori people|Māori]] as ''[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]'' (sacred), and the wearing of its skin or feathers was reserved for people of high status.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
[[File:Heteralocha acutirostris.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Two stuffed birds on a wooden stand|[[Taxidermy]] exhibit of a pair at [[Museum für Naturkunde]], [[Germany]]]]
The genus name, ''Heteralocha'', derives from [[Ancient Greek]] ''ἕτερος'' "different" and ''ἄλοχος'' "wife".&lt;ref name=CabMusHeinThI/&gt; It refers to the striking difference in bill shape between male and female. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]], ''acutirostris'', derives from [[Latin]] ''acutus'', meaning "sharp pointed", and ''rostrum'', meaning "beak", and refers to the beak of the female.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/&gt;&lt;!--cites both sentences--&gt;

[[John Gould]] described the huia in 1836 as two species: ''Neomorpha acutirostris'' based on a female specimen, and ''N. crassirostris'' based on a male specimen—the epithet ''crassirostris'' derives from the Latin ''crassus'', meaning "thick" or "heavy", and refers to the male's short bill.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/&gt; In 1840, [[George Robert Gray]] proposed the name ''N. gouldii'', arguing that neither of Gould's names was applicable to the species.&lt;ref name="Gray1840"&gt;[[#GRG|Gray 1840]]:15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, [[Jean Cabanis]] replaced the name ''Neomorpha'', which had been previously used for a [[cuckoo]] genus, with ''Heteralocha''.&lt;ref name="CabMusHeinThI"&gt;[[#JC|Cabanis 1850–1851]]:218, footnote&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888 Sir [[Walter Buller]] wrote: "I have deemed it more in accordance with the accepted rules of zoological nomenclature to adopt the first of the two names applied to the species by Mr Gould; and the name ''Neomorpha'' having been previously used in ornithology, it becomes necessary to adopt that of ''Heteralocha'', proposed by Dr Cabanis for this form."&lt;ref name="BullerPpage8"&gt;[[#WLB|Buller 1888]]:8&lt;/ref&gt;

The huia appears to be a remnant of an early expansion of [[passerines]] in the country of New Zealand, and is the largest of the three members of the family [[Callaeidae]], the New Zealand wattlebirds; the others are the [[Saddleback (bird)|saddleback]] and the [[kōkako]]. The only close relative to the family is the [[stitchbird]]; their taxonomic relationships to other birds remain to be determined.&lt;ref name="Ewen2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ewen |first1=John G |last2=Flux |first2=Ian |last3=Ericson |first3=Per GP |year=2006 |title=Systematic affinities of two enigmatic New Zealand passerines of high conservation priority, the hihi or stitchbird ''Notiomystis cincta'' and the kōkako ''Callaeas cinerea'' |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=40 |pmid=16527495 |issue=1 |pages=281–84 |url=http://www.nrm.se/download/18.4e1d3ca810c24ddc7038000945/Ewen+et+al+Stitchbird+MPEV+2006.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.01.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; A molecular study of the nuclear RAG-1 and c-mos genes of the three species within the family proved inconclusive, the data providing most support for either a basally diverging kōkako or huia.&lt;ref name="shepherd07"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|last1=Shepherd|first1=Lara D.|last2=Lambert|first2=David M.|title=The relationships and origins of the New Zealand wattlebirds (Passeriformes, Callaeatidae) from DNA sequence analyses|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|pmid=17369056|volume=43|issue=2|pages=480–92|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.12.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heteralochaskull.png|upright|thumb|alt=Skull of a bird drawn in outline, side view, back view and view from underneath|The skull had hollows, ''digastric fossae'', accommodating the strong muscles that open the bill]]
Although sexual dimorphism in bill shape is found in other birds, such as the [[Ptiloris|riflebirds]], [[Epimachus|sicklebills]] and other wood-excavating birds including some species of [[woodpecker]],&lt;ref name="KJWA-76"&gt;[[#KJW|Jayne-Wilson 2004]]:76&lt;/ref&gt; it was most pronounced in the huia.&lt;ref name="Firth"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frith |first=CB |year=1997 |title=Huia (''Heteralocha acutirostris: Callaeidae'')-like sexual bill dimorphism in some birds of paradise (Paradisaeidae) and its significance |journal=Notornis |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=177–84 |url=http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_44_3_177.pdf |accessdate=16 January 2013| format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beak of the male was short at approximately {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} and slightly arched downwards&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt; and robust, very similar to that of the closely related saddleback, while the female's beak was finer, longer at around {{convert|104|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and decurved (curved downward) like that of a [[hummingbird]] or [[honeyeater]]. The difference was not only in the bone; the [[rhamphotheca]] grew way past the end of the bony maxilla and mandible to produce a pliable implement able to deeply penetrate holes made by wood-boring beetle larvae. The skulls and mandibles of the huia and saddleback are very similar, the latter essentially miniatures of the former.&lt;ref name="worholC-481"&gt;[[#worhol|Holdaway, Worthy 2002]]:481&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two possible explanations for the evolution of this sexual difference in bill shape. The most widely supported is that it allowed birds of different sexes to utilise different food sources.&lt;ref name="KJWA-76"/&gt; This divergence may have arisen because of a lack of competitors in these foraging niches in the North Island forest ecosystems.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; The other idea is that the ivory-coloured bill, which contrasted sharply with the bird's black plumage, may have been used to attract a mate. In animals that use sexually dimorphic physical traits to attract a mate, the dimorphic feature is often brightly coloured or contrasts with the rest of the body, as with the huia.&lt;ref name="KJWA-76"/&gt; It has been suggested that as the female was the main provider of food for the chicks by regurgitation, this sex evolved the longer bill to obtain the protein-rich invertebrate diet required for the chicks.&lt;ref name="KJWA-76"/&gt;

Another, less obvious aspect of the huia's sexual dimorphism was the minor size difference between the sexes. Males were {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, while females were larger at {{convert|48|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="FGBNZ"/&gt; Additionally, the tail of the male was about {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and the wingspan was between {{convert|21|and|22|cm|in|abbr=on}}, while the female's tail was {{convert|19.5|to|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} and the female's wingspan was {{convert|20|to|20.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="WWFE"/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Heteralocha gouldii 47.jpg|thumb|upright|Skeleton showing long legs suitable for hopping]]
[[Subfossil]] deposits and [[midden]] remains reveal that the huia was once widespread in both lowland and montane native forest throughout the [[North Island]],&lt;ref name="FGBNZ"/&gt; extending from the northernmost tip at [[Cape Reinga]]&lt;ref name="Tennyson, Martinson"&gt;[[#ATPM|Tennyson and Martinson 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Wellington]] and the [[Aorangi Range]] in the far south. Only a few huia are known from the extensive pitfall deposits in the [[karst]] of the [[Waitomo Caves]] area and they are also rare or absent in fossil deposits in the central North Island and [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]]; it seems to have preferred habitats that are not well sampled by the deposits known at present.&lt;ref name="Tennyson, Martinson"/&gt; The huia vanished from the northern and western North Island following Māori settlement in the 14th century, due to over-hunting, forest clearance, and introduced [[Polynesian rat|kiore]] preying on nests.&lt;ref name="worholA-556"&gt;[[#worhol|Holdaway, Worthy 2002]]:556&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of European settlement in the 1840s it was only found only south of a line from the [[Raukumara Range]] in the east, across the [[Kaimanawa Range]], to the [[Turakina River]] in the [[Rangitikei District|Rangitikei]] in the west.&lt;ref name="FGBNZ"/&gt; In the south, its range extended to the [[Wairarapa]] and the [[Rimutaka Range]] east of Wellington.&lt;ref name="FGBNZ"/&gt; Reports collected by [[Walter Buller]] and a single ''waiata'' (Māori song) suggest that the huia was once also found in the Marlborough and Nelson districts of the [[South Island]]; however, it has never been identified in the rich fossil deposits south of Cook Strait,&lt;ref name="worholA-437"&gt;[[#worhol|Holdaway, Worthy 2002]]:437&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no other evidence of the species' presence.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"&gt;[[#HANZAB|Higgins et al. 2006]]:1014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt;

The huia inhabited both of the two principal forest types in New Zealand. They were primarily found in [[Temperate rainforest#New Zealand temperate rain forests|broadleaf-podocarp]] forests where there was a dense understorey, but occasionally also in southern beech (''[[Nothofagus]]'') forest. The species was observed in native vegetation including mataī (''[[Prumnopitys taxifolia]]''), rimu (''[[Dacrydium cupressinum]]''), kahikatea (''[[Dacrycarpus dacrydioides]]''), northern rātā (''[[Metrosideros robusta]]''), maire (''[[Nestegis]]''), hinau  (''[[Elaeocarpus dentatus]]''), totara (''[[Podocarpus totara]]''), rewarewa (''[[Knightia excelsa]]''), mahoe (''[[Melicytus ramiflorus]]''), and taraire (''[[Beilschmiedia tarairi]]''), and at sea level in karaka (''[[Corynocarpus laevigatus]]'') trees at [[Turakirae Head|Cape Turakirae]]. It was never seen in burnt forest or land cleared for farming.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/&gt;

===Movements===
The huia's movements are little known, but it was most likely sedentary.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; The huia is thought to have undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane forests in the summer and moving down into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the saddleback and the kōkako, the huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above tree height.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long leaps and bounds through the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] or across the forest floor,&lt;ref name="FGBNZ"/&gt; or it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt;

===Feeding and ecology===
The huia, with the previously endangered saddleback, were the two species of classic bark and wood probers in the arboreal insectivore [[Guild (ecology)|guild]] in the New Zealand avifauna. Woodpeckers do not occur east of [[Wallace Line|Wallace's line]]; their [[ecological niche]] is filled by other groups of birds that feed on wood-boring beetle larvae, albeit in rotting wood. The woodpecker-like role was taken on by two species in two different families in the New Zealand mixed-podocarp and ''Nothofagus'' forests; one was the huia and the other was the [[New Zealand kaka|kaka]].&lt;ref name="worholB-483"&gt;[[#worhol|Holdaway, Worthy 2002]]:483&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Huhu grubs.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Two large insect larvae in tunnels in a tree branch|A favourite food of the huia: the [[larvae]] of the huhu beetle, ''[[Prionoplus reticularis]]'']]
The huia foraged mainly on decaying wood.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; Although it was considered a specialist predator of the [[larva]]e of the [[nocturnal]] huhu beetle (''[[Prionoplus reticularis]]''), it also ate other insects—including [[weta]]—insect larvae, spiders, and fruit.&lt;ref name="FGBNZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"&gt;[[#HANZAB|Higgins et al. 2006]]:1015&lt;/ref&gt;

Insects and spiders were taken from decaying wood, from under bark, mosses and lichens, and from the ground. Huia foraged either alone, in pairs, or in small flocks of up to five, which were probably family groups.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"&gt;[[#HANZAB|Higgins et al. 2006]]:1016&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual dimorphism of the bill structure gave rise to feeding strategies that differed radically between the sexes. The male used its [[adze]]-like bill to chisel and rip into the outer layers of decaying wood,&lt;ref name="worholB-483"/&gt; while the female probed areas inaccessible to the male, such as the burrows of insect larvae in living wood. The male had well-developed cranial musculature allowing rotten wood to be chiselled and pried apart by "gaping" motions.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; There are corresponding differences in the structure and musculature of the head and neck between males and females.&lt;ref name="worholA-437"/&gt; Huia had very well developed [[depressor jaw muscles]], and an [[internal occipital crest|occipital crest]] that provided extra surface for muscle attachment, allowing the jaw to be opened with considerable force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Burton, Philip J.K.|title=Anatomy of head and neck in the Huia (''Heteralocha acutirostris'') with comparative notes on other callaeidae|journal=Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History), Zoology|volume=27|issue=1|year=1974|pages= 3–48|url=https://archive.org/stream/bulletinofbritis27zoollond#page/3/mode/1up/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the bird had secured a meal, it flew to a perch with the insect in its feet. The huia stripped its meal of any hard parts, then tossed the remainder up, caught, and swallowed it.&lt;ref name="WWFE"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Contrary to popular opinion, meals were not often shared by a pair (although such behaviour may have occasionally served to strengthen the pair bond). --&gt;
Pairs did not cooperate in feeding, at least not in a strict sense. All such reports are based on misunderstanding of an account by ornithologist [[Walter Buller]]&lt;ref name="Buller"&gt;[[#WLB|Buller 1888]]&lt;/ref&gt; of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae.&lt;ref name="Jamieson and Spencer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jamieson |first1=Ian G |last2=Spencer |first2=Hamish G |year=1996 |title=The bill and foraging behaviour of the Huia (''Heteralocha acutirostris''): were they unique? |journal=Notornis |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=14–18 |url=http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_43_1_14.pdf|format=PDF fulltext |accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this misunderstanding, which has become part of ecological folklore, the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels with her long, pliant bill.&lt;ref name="worholA-437"/&gt; Rather, the divergent bills represent an extreme example of [[niche differentiation]], reducing [[intraspecific competition]] between the sexes. This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.&lt;ref name="worholD-482"&gt;[[#worhol|Holdaway, Worthy 2002]]:482&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moorhouse"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moorhouse |first=Ron J |year=1996 |title=The extraordinary bill dimorphism of the Huia (''Heteralocha acutirostris''): sexual selection or intersexual competition? |journal=Notornis |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=19–34 |url=http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_43_1_19.pdf|format=PDF fulltext |accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Zealand forest relies heavily on [[frugivorous]] birds for seed dispersal: about 70% of the woody plants have fruits that are probably dispersed by birds, which included the huia.&lt;ref name="NZJE"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The importance of birds as browsers, seed dispersers and pollinators in New Zealand forests|first1=M.N.|last1= Clout|first2= J.R.|last2= Hay|journal= New Zealand Journal of Ecology|volume= 12|year =1989|issue=supplement|pages=27–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of fruits eaten by the huia is difficult to establish:&lt;ref name="NZJE"/&gt; hinau (''[[Elaeocarpus dentatus]]''), pigeonwood (''[[Hedycarya arborea]]'') and various species of ''[[Coprosma]]'' are recorded by Buller,&lt;ref name="NZJE"/&gt; and they were also recorded as eating the fruits of kahikatea (''[[Dacrycarpus dacrydioides]]'').&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; The extinction of the huia and other frugivorous New Zealand bird species including the [[moa]] and [[North Island piopio|piopio]], and the diminishing range of many others, including the [[kiwi]], [[weka]], and [[kōkako]], has left few effective seed dispersers in the New Zealand forest.&lt;ref name="NZJE"/&gt; For plants with fruit greater than 1&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, [[kereru]] are the sole remaining dispersers in the ecosystem, and they are rare or extinct in some areas.&lt;ref name="NZJE"/&gt; This depletion of avifauna in the forest ecosystem may be having major impacts on processes such as forest regeneration and seed dispersal.&lt;ref name="NZJE"/&gt;

===Voice===
Like so many other aspects of its biology, the vocalisations of the huia are not well known,&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; and present knowledge is based on very few accounts. The calls were mostly a varied array of whistles, "peculiar and strange", but also "soft, melodious and flute-like".&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; An imitation of the bird's call survives as a recording of 1909 huia search team member Henare Hamana whistling the call (see ''External links'').&lt;ref name="HoldawayTeAra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/extinctions/6/3/2 |title=Extinctions |last=Holdaway|first=Richard|year=2009 |work=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huia were often silent. When they did vocalise, their calls could carry considerable distances – some were audible from up to {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} away through dense forest.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; The calls were said to differ between sexes, though there are no details. Calls were given with the bird's head and neck stretched outward and its bill pointing 30 to 45 degrees from the vertical.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; Most references describe huia calls as heard in the early morning; one records it as the first bird to sing in the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]], and captive birds were known to "wake the household".&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/&gt; Like the [[Whitehead (bird)|whitehead]], huia behaved unusually before the onset of wet weather, being "happy and in full song".&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/&gt; The bird's name is [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]]:&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; it was named by Māori for its loud distress call, a smooth, unslurred whistle rendered as ''uia, uia, uia'' or ''where are you?''. This call was said to be given when the bird was excited or hungry.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/&gt; Chicks had a "plaintive cry, pleasant to the ear", would feebly answer imitations by people, and were very noisy when kept in tents.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/&gt;

==Social behaviour and reproduction==

The female's beak (top) was finer, longer, and more curved than the male's (below)]]
A quiet, social bird, the huia was [[monogamous]], and pairs probably paired for life.&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; The bird was usually found in breeding pairs, although sometimes groups of four or more were encountered.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; [[Walter Buller]] records that a tame pair would always keep close to each other, constantly uttering a "low affectionate twitter", even when in captivity. There are records of this same pair&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; and a further, wild pair&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt; "hopping from branch to branch and fanning their tails, then meeting to caress each other with their bills" and uttering these noises. The male is said to have fed the female in courtship.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; It is thought that these behaviours may have been a sexual display. The claim that the male fed the female while she was incubating and on the nest "lacks evidence".&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/&gt; When the male of this captive pair was accidentally killed, the female "manifesting the utmost distress pined for her mate and died 10 days afterwards".&lt;ref name="Buller"/&gt; A Māori man in the 19th century recalled: "I was always told by my old people that a pair of huia lived on most affectionate terms&amp;nbsp;... If the male died first, the female died soon after of grief".&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt; The huia had no fear of people; females allowed themselves to be handled on the nest,&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt; and birds could easily be captured by hand.&lt;ref name="FLM"/&gt;

Little is known about the huia's reproduction, as only two eggs and four nests were ever described.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/&gt; The only known huia egg to still exist is in the collection of the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Heteralocha acutirostris | work = Collections Online | publisher = Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa | url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=534075 | accessdate = 17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The breeding season for mating, building nests, laying eggs and raising young is thought to have been late spring (October–November).&lt;ref name="WWFE"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Huia |encyclopedia=The Official World Wildlife Fund Guide to Extinct Species of Modern Times |volume=1 |pages=63–65| publisher=Beacham Publishing|location=Osprey, Florida |year=1997|isbn=978-0-933833-40-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/&gt; It is thought they nested solitarily; pairs are said to have been [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and the birds would remain on their territories for life.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; Huia appear to have raised just one brood per season;&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/&gt; the number of eggs in a clutch is variously described as being 3–5, 4, 2–4 and 1–4.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/&gt; These eggs were greyish with purple and brown speckles, and measured {{convert|45|by|30|mm|in|abbr=on}}. [[Avian incubation|Incubation]] was mostly by the female, though there is evidence that the male also had a small role, as rubbed-bare [[brooding patch]]es that were smaller than those of females were discovered on some males in November.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/&gt; The incubation period is unknown.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/&gt; Eggshells were apparently removed from the nest by adults. The brood size was usually one or two, though there was the odd record of up to three chicks in a single nest. Nests were constructed in varying places: in dead trees, the crooks of large branches, tree hollows, on branches, or "on or near the ground", and some nests were covered with hanging vegetation or vines. The nest itself was a large saucer-shaped structure, up to 350&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and 70&amp;nbsp;mm deep, with thick walls of dry grass, leaves and "withered stems of herbaceous plants".&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/&gt; A central small, shallow cup of soft materials such as grass and fine twigs cushioned and insulated the eggs.&lt;ref name="FGBNZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt;  After hatching, young remained in the family group and were fed by the adults for three months, by which time they appeared adult.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1016"/&gt;

==Relationship with humans==

===In culture===
[[File:TukukinoLindauer.jpg|upright|right|thumb|alt=Old painting of a Māori man with a birdskin ornament hanging from one ear|Tukukino, a [[Māori people|Māori]] chief from the [[Hauraki District|Hauraki district]], wearing a ''pōhoi'' ornament made from a huia skin in this 1878 [[Gottfried Lindauer|Lindauer]] portrait.]]
In Māori culture, the "white heron and the Huia were not normally eaten but were rare birds treasured for their precious plumes, worn by people of high rank".&lt;ref name="Orbell"&gt;[[#MRO|Orbell 1992]]:82–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orbell note"&gt;Orbell mentions some of the sacred associations of the huia, saying that if a man dreamed of a huia or its feathers, it meant his wife would conceive a daughter (page 83).&lt;/ref&gt; The bold and inquisitive nature of the huia made it particularly easy to capture.&lt;ref name="FLM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt; Māori attracted the huia by imitating its call and then captured it with a ''tari'' (a carved pole with a noose at the end) or snare, or killed it with clubs or long spears. Often they exploited the strong pair bond by capturing one of a pair, which would then call out, attracting its mate, which could be easily captured.&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buller"/&gt; Opinion on the quality of huia meat as food varied wildly; although not usually hunted for this purpose, the huia was considered "good eating" in pies or curried stew&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; by some,&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt; but a "tough morsel" and "unfit to eat" by others.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt;

Although the huia's range was restricted to the southern North Island, its tail feathers were valued highly and were exchanged among tribes for other valuable goods such as [[pounamu]] and shark teeth, or given as tokens of friendship and respect. Through this trade, the feathers reached the far north and the far south of New Zealand.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FLM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt; They were stored in intricately carved boxes called ''[[waka huia]]'', which were hung from the ceilings of chiefs' houses.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt; Huia feathers were worn at funerals and used to decorate the heads of the deceased.&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FULLER"&gt;{{cite book |title=Extinct Birds; Foreword by The Hon. Miriam Rothschild|last=Fuller |first=Errol |year=1987 |publisher=Viking/Rainbird |location=London|pages=229–33|ref=FULLER}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''marereko'', described by [[Edward Robert Tregear]] as an "ancient war-plume", consisted of twelve huia feathers.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TGR"&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward Robert |last=Tregear |year=1904 |title=The Māori Race |publisher=Archibald Dudingston Willis |location=Wanganui |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-TreRace.html |accessdate=2 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highly valued ''pōhoi'' was an ornament made from the skin of the huia: the bird was skinned with the beak, skull and wattles attached and the legs and wings removed,&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt; carefully dried, and the resulting ornament worn from the neck or ears.&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt; Dried huia heads were also worn as pendants called ''ngutu huia''.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014" /&gt; A captured huia would be kept in a small cage so that its tail feathers could be plucked as they grew to full size.&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FLM"/&gt;

[[File:1898 Huia 3 pence brown.JPG|left|upright|thumb|alt=Orange-coloured postage stamp with a central picture of two birds|A pair of huia are pictured on New Zealand's 1898 threepenny stamp.]]

The bird was also kept by Māori as a pet, and like the [[Tui (bird)|tui]], it could be trained to say a few words.&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt; There is also a record of a tame huia kept by European settlers in a small village in the [[Tararua District|Forty-Mile Bush]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="FLM"/&gt;

New Zealand has released several postage stamps portraying the huia,&lt;ref name="nzpost1"&gt;{{cite web |author=New Zealand Post |title=Redrawn Pictorials |work=Stamps: Historical Issues |url=http://stamps.nzpost.co.nz/new-zealand/1907/redrawn-pictorials|accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nzpost2"&gt;{{cite web |author=New Zealand Post |title=Extinct Birds |work=Stamps: Historical Issues |url=http://stamps.nzpost.co.nz/new-zealand/1996/extinct-birds|accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the New Zealand sixpence circulated from 1933 to 1966 featured a female huia on the reverse.

The degree to which the huia was known and admired in New Zealand is reflected in the large number of suburban and geographical features which are named after the species. There are several roads and streets named after the huia in the North Island, with several in Wellington (including Huia Road in [[Eastbourne, New Zealand|Days Bay]] – not far from where one of the last sightings of this species occurred in the early 1920s in the forests of [[East Harbour Regional Park]]) and also in Auckland, where there is even a [[Huia, New Zealand|Huia]] suburb in [[Waitakere City|Waitakere]]. A [[Huia River|river]] on the west coast of the South Island and the [[Huiarau Range]]s in the central North Island are also named after the bird. The species was once found living in great abundance in the forests of these mountains:&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/&gt; ''Huiarau'' means "a hundred huia".&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; Businesses include the public swimming pool in [[Lower Hutt]], a [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]] winery, and [[Huia Publishers]], which specialises in Māori writing and perspectives. The name was first given to a child in the late 19th century, to the son of members of a lower North Island ''[[iwi]]'' concerned about the bird's rapid decline,&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt; and although uncommon, it is still used today in New Zealand as a name for girls and more rarely for boys (e.g. [[Huia Edmonds]]), of both European and Māori descent.

Tail feathers of the extinct huia are very rare and they have become a collectors' item. In June 2010 a single huia tail feather sold at auction in Auckland for [[NZ$]]8,000, much higher than the $500 the auctioneers had expected, making it the most expensive feather ever. The previous record price for a single feather was $US2,800 (NZ$4,000) achieved by a [[bald eagle]] feather at auction in the United States.&lt;ref name="stamp"&gt;{{cite news |last=Malkin |first=Bonnie |title=Most expensive feather ever fetches £4,000 at auction ''Heteralocha acutirostris'' |work=Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/newzealand/7846625/Most-expensive-feather-ever-fetches-4000-at-auction.html|accessdate=27 June 2010 | location=London | date=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 New Zealand film ''[[Hunt for the Wilderpeople]]'' two of the characters encounter a huia, and eventually set out to obtain proof of their sighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=11 May 2016 |title=Sound archives - the huia |url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/afternoons/audio/201800304/sound-archives-the-huia |work=Jesse Mulligan |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |access-date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extinction===
[[File:WearingHuiafeathers.jpg|upright|left|thumb|alt=Man wearing traditional Māori cloak with two feathers in his hair|A Māori man from the Hauraki district wearing huia tail feathers in his hair (photo before 1886).]]
The huia was found throughout the North Island before humans arrived in New Zealand. Māori are estimated to have arrived around 750 years ago, and by the arrival of European settlers in the 1840s, habitat destruction, hunting, and introduced rats had reduced the bird's range to the southern North Island.&lt;ref name="FGBNZ"/&gt; However, Māori hunting pressures on the huia were limited to some extent by traditional protocols. The hunting season was from May to July when the bird's plumage was in prime condition, while a ''[[rāhui]]'' (hunting ban) was enforced in spring and summer.&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt; After European settlement the huia's numbers began to decline more quickly, due mainly to two well-documented factors: widespread deforestation and over hunting.

Like the extinctions of other New Zealand birds such as the [[North Island piopio|piopio]] in the 19th century, the decline of the huia was poorly studied. Massive deforestation occurred in the North Island at this time, particularly in the lowlands of southern [[Hawkes Bay]], the [[Manawatu]] and the [[Wairarapa]], as land was cleared by European settlers for agriculture. The huia was particularly vulnerable to this as it could only live in [[old-growth forest]] where there were abundant rotting trees filled with wood-boring insect larvae. It seems it could not survive in regenerating, [[secondary forest]]s.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt; Although the mountainous part of its former range was not deforested, the lowland forests of the valleys below were systematically destroyed.&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt; The destruction of this part of its habitat would have undoubtedly had a severe impact on huia populations, but its removal would have been particularly dire if they did in fact descend to the lowlands as a winter refuge to escape snow at higher altitudes&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FULLER"/&gt; as some researchers including Oliver have surmised.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt;

It appears that predation by invasive mammalian species including [[Black rat|ship rat]]s, cats, and [[mustelid]]s was an additional factor in the decline in huia numbers – introduction of these animals by New Zealand [[Acclimatisation societies in New Zealand|acclimatisation societies]] peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly sharp decline in huia populations.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/&gt; Because it spent a lot of time on the ground, the huia would have been particularly vulnerable to mammalian predators.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FGBNZ"/&gt; Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; introduced from Asia with the [[common myna]].

Habitat destruction and the predations of introduced species were problems faced by all New Zealand birds, but in addition the huia faced massive pressure from hunting. Due to its pronounced sexual dimorphism and its beauty, huia were sought after as [[taxidermy|mounted specimens]] by wealthy collectors in Europe&lt;ref name="KJWB-140"&gt;[[#KJW|Jayne-Wilson 2004]]:140&lt;/ref&gt; and by museums all over the world.&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; These individuals and institutions were willing to pay large sums of money for good specimens, and the overseas demand created a strong financial incentive for hunters in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="KJWB-140"/&gt; This hunting was initially by naturalists. Austrian taxidermist [[Andreas Reischek]] took 212 pairs as specimens for the natural history museum in [[Vienna]] over a period of 10 years,&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt; while New Zealand ornithologist [[Walter Buller]] collected 18 on just one of several expeditions to the [[Rimutaka Range]]s in 1883.&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt; Others keen to profit soon joined in. Buller records that also in 1883, a party of 11 Māori obtained 646 huia skins from the forest between the [[Manawatu Gorge]] and [[Akitio]].&lt;ref name="FGBNZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buller"/&gt; Several thousand huia were exported overseas as part of this trade.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt; Infrastructure development within lowland forest did not help the situation: hundreds of huia were shot around road and rail construction camps.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; {{quote|While we were looking at and admiring this little picture of bird-life, a pair of Huia, without uttering a sound, appeared in a tree overhead, and as they were caressing each other with their beautiful bills, a charge of No.&amp;nbsp;6 brought them both to the ground together.

Commercial [[hunting]] may have contributed to the [[extinction]] of the huia.]]
The rampant and unsustainable hunting was not just financially motivated: it also had a more philosophical, fatalistic aspect.&lt;ref name="KJWB-140"/&gt; The conventional wisdom among New Zealand Europeans in the 19th century was that things colonial, whether they were plants, animals or people, were inferior to things European.&lt;ref name="KJWC-265"&gt;[[#KJW|Jayne-Wilson 2004]]:265&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely assumed that the plants and animals of New Zealand's forest ecosystems would be quickly replaced by more vigorous and competitive European species.&lt;ref name="KJWC-265"/&gt; This assumption of inevitable doom led to a conclusion that the conservation of native biota was pointless and futile; Victorian collectors instead focused their efforts on acquiring a good range of specimens before the rare species disappeared altogether.&lt;ref name="KJWB-140"/&gt;

There were some attempts to conserve the huia, but they were few, poorly organised and poorly enforced legally: the [[conservation movement]] in New Zealand was still very much in its infancy.&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt; There were successive sharp declines in numbers of huia in the 1860s&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014" /&gt; and in the late 1880s, prompting the chiefs of the Manawatu and the Wairarapa to place a [[rāhui]] on the [[Tararua Range]].&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt; In February 1892, the Wild Birds Protection Act was amended to include the huia, making it illegal to kill the bird, but enforcement was not taken seriously.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt; Island sanctuaries were set up for endangered native birds after this act, but the new bird sanctuaries, including [[Kapiti Island]], [[Little Barrier Island]] and [[Resolution Island, New Zealand|Resolution Island]], were never stocked with huia. Although attempts were made to capture birds for transfer, no huia were ever transferred.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/&gt; The Kapiti Island attempt is documented as being particularly poorly managed.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt; A live pair destined to be transferred to the island in 1893 was instead appropriated by Buller, who bent the law to take them back to England as a present for [[Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]], along with the last collected live pair of [[laughing owl]]s.&lt;ref name="KJWC-265"/&gt;

The [[Duke of York|Duke]] and [[Duchess of York]] (later [[George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]) visited New Zealand in 1901. At an official Māori welcome in [[Rotorua]], a guide took a huia tail feather from her hair and placed it in the band of the Duke's hat as a token of respect.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; Many people in England and New Zealand wanted to emulate this royal fashion and wear huia feathers in their hats. The price of tail feathers was soon pushed to £1, making each bird worth £12, and some feathers sold for as much as £5.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt; Female huia beaks were also set in gold as jewellery.&lt;ref name="NZ Lib"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=226654&amp;coltype=history&amp;regno=gh005020 |title=Huia beak brooch |work=Collections Online |publisher=Museum of New Zealand-Te Papa Tongarewa |year=2004 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shooting season notices ceased listing the huia as a protected species in 1901,&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt; and a last-ditch attempt to reinforce government protection failed when the solicitor general ruled that there was no law to protect feathers.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt;
[[File:Mokau Falls.JPG|upright|right|thumb|alt=Dense forest with a waterfall|[[Mokau Falls]] in [[Te Urewera]] is close to the location of the last credible huia sightings.]]
The decline of the huia over the southern half of the North Island occurred at markedly different rates in different locations. Areas where dramatic declines were observed in the 1880s included the Puketoi Range, the [[Hutt Valley]] and Tararuas, and the [[Pahiatua]]-[[Dannevirke]] area.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1015"/&gt; The species was abundant in a few places in the early 20th century between Hawke's Bay and the Wairarapa;&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/&gt; a flock of 100–150 birds was reported at the summit of the Akatarawa–Waikanae track in 1905; they were still "fairly plentiful" in the upper reaches of the [[Rangitikei River]] in 1906&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/&gt; – and yet, the last confirmed sighting came just one year later.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/&gt;

The last official, confirmed huia sighting was made on 28 December 1907 when W. W. Smith saw three birds in the forests of the Tararua Ranges.&lt;ref name="FGBNZ"/&gt; Unconfirmed, "quite credible" reports suggest that extinction for the species came a little later. A man familiar with the species reported seeing three huia in Gollans Valley behind York Bay (between [[Petone]] and [[Eastbourne, New Zealand|Eastbourne]] on Wellington Harbour), an area of mixed beech and podocarp forest well within the bird's former range, on 28 December 1922.&lt;ref name="WS"&gt;[[#RMHS|Morris and Smith 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sightings of the huia were also reported there in 1912 and 1913. Despite this, naturalists from the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Dominion Museum]] in Wellington did not investigate the reports. The last credible reports of huia come from the forests of [[Te Urewera National Park]], with one from near Mt Urutawa in 1952 and final sightings near [[Lake Waikareiti]] in 1961 and 1963.&lt;ref name="HANZAB7A-1014"/&gt; The possibility of a small huia population still surviving in the Urewera ranges has been proposed by some researchers, but is considered highly unlikely. No recent expeditions have been mounted to find a living specimen.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ Geo"/&gt;

Students at [[Hastings Boys' High School]] organised a conference in 1999 to consider [[cloning]] the huia, their school emblem.&lt;ref name="NZSM"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612131328/http://nzsm.webcentre.co.nz/article2371.htm |archivedate=12 June 2008 |url=http://nzsm.webcentre.co.nz/article2371.htm |title=Boys Cloning Birds |work=New Zealand Science Monthly |publisher=Webcentre |last=Perry |first=Chris |date=September 2000 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN1999"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/NATURE/9907/20/cloning.enn/ |title=Cloning of extinct Huia bird approved |work=CNN Nature |publisher=Cable News Network |date=20 July 1999 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribe [[Ngāti Huia]] agreed in principle to support the endeavour, which would be carried out at the [[University of Otago]], and a California-based Internet start-up volunteered $100,000 of funding.&lt;ref name="Dorey1999"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dorey |first=Emma |title=Huia cloned back to life? |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=17 |issue=8 |page=736 |year=1999 |url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v17/n8/full/nbt0899_736c.html |pmid=10429272 |doi=10.1038/11628 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sandy Bartle, curator of birds at the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]], said that the complete huia [[genome]] could not be derived from museum skins because of the poor state of the [[DNA]], and cloning was therefore unlikely to succeed.&lt;ref name="listener3433"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.listener.co.nz/current-affairs/science/the-last-huia/ |title=The Last Huia |last=Priestley |first=Rebecca |date=25 February – 3 March 2006 |work=New Zealand Listener |publisher=APN Holdings NZ |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[language]]s arranged by the approximate dates of the oldest existing [[writing|texts]] recording a complete sentence in the language.  It does not include [[undeciphered scripts]], though there are various claims without wide acceptance, which, if substantiated, would push backward the first attestation of certain languages.  It also does not include inscriptions consisting of isolated words or names from a language.
In most cases, some form of the language had already been spoken (and even written) considerably earlier than the dates of the earliest extant samples provided here.

A written record may encode a stage of a language corresponding to an earlier time, either as a result of [[oral tradition]], or because the earliest source is a copy of an older manuscript that was lost. An oral tradition of [[epic poetry]] may typically bridge a few centuries, and in rare cases, over a millennium. An extreme case is the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] of the ''[[Rigveda]]'': the earliest parts of this text may date to {{circa|lk=no}} 1500 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}} pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; while the oldest known manuscripts date to {{circa|lk=no}} 1040 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}} p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly the oldest [[Avestan language|Avestan]] texts, the ''[[Gathas]]'', are believed to have been composed before 1000 BC, but the oldest Avestan manuscripts date from the 13th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For languages that have developed out of a known predecessor, dates provided here follow conventional terminology. For example, [[Old French]] developed gradually out of [[Vulgar Latin]], and the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] (842) listed are the earliest text that is classified as "Old French".

==Before 1000 BC==
{{Further|Bronze Age writing}}
Writing first appeared in the [[Near East]] at the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC.  A very limited number of languages are attested in the area from before the [[Bronze Age collapse]] and the rise of [[alphabetic writing]]:
* the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], [[Hattic language|Hattic]] and [[Elamite language]] isolates,
* [[Afro-Asiatic]] in the form of the [[Ancient Egyptian language|Egyptian]] and [[Semitic languages]] and
* [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ([[Anatolian languages]] and [[Mycenaean Greek]]).
In [[East Asia]] towards the end of the second millennium BC, the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] family was represented by [[Old Chinese]].

There are also a number of [[undeciphered writing systems|undeciphered]] Bronze Age records:
* [[Proto-Elamite script]] and [[Linear Elamite]]
* the [[Indus script]] (claimed to record a "[[Harappan language]]")
* [[Cretan hieroglyphs]] and [[Linear A]] (encoding a possible "[[Minoan language]]"){{sfnp|Woodard|2008|p=2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/lterms/qt/linear_a.htm |title=Linear A – Undeciphered Writing System of the Minoans |publisher=Archaeology.about.com |date=2013-07-13 |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Cypro-Minoan syllabary]]{{sfnp|Woodard|2008|p=3}}
Earlier symbols, such as the [[Jiahu symbols]], [[Vinča symbols]] and the marks on the [[Dispilio tablet]], are believed to be [[proto-writing]], rather than representations of language.

[[File:Sarcophag of Ahiram inscription.png|thumb|right|upright=2.2|The [[Ahiram]] epitaph is the earliest substantial inscription in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].]]
The earliest known alphabetic inscriptions, at [[Serabit el-Khadim]] ({{circa|lk=no}} 1500 BC), appear to record a [[Northwest Semitic]] language, though only one or two words have been deciphered.
In the [[Early Iron Age]], alphabetic writing spread across the Near East and southern Europe. With the emergence of the [[Brahmic family of scripts]], [[languages of India]] are attested from after about 300 BC.

There is only fragmentary evidence for languages such as [[Iberian language|Iberian]], [[Tartessian language|Tartessian]], [[Galatian language|Galatian]], [[Thracian language|Thracian]] and [[Messapian language|Messapian]].{{sfnp|Woodard|2008|pp=4, 9, 11}}
The [[North Picene language]] of the Novilara Stele from {{circa|lk=no}} 600 BC has not been deciphered.{{sfnp|Woodard|2008|p=4}}
The earliest examples of the Central American [[Isthmian script]] date from {{circa|lk=no}} 500 BC, but a proposed decipherment remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lost Languages: The Enigma of the World's Undeciphered Scripts | first = Andrew | last = Robinson | publisher = Thames &amp; Hudson | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-500-51453-5 | page = 263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First millennium AD==
From [[Late Antiquity]], we have for the first time languages with earliest records in [[manuscript]] tradition (as opposed to [[epigraphy]]). Thus, [[Old Armenian]] is first attested in the [[Armenian Bible translation]].

The [[Vimose inscriptions]] (2nd and 3rd centuries) in the [[Elder Futhark]] runic alphabet appear to record [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]] names. Some scholars interpret the [[Negau helmet]] inscription ({{circa|lk=no}} 100 BC) as a Germanic fragment.

This is a '''list of shoe styles and designs'''. A [[shoe]] is an item of [[footwear]] intended to protect and comfort the human foot while doing various activities. Shoes are also used as an item of decoration. The design of shoes has varied enormously through time and from culture to culture, with appearance originally being tied to function. Additionally, fashion has often dictated many design elements, such as whether shoes have very high heels or flat ones. Contemporary footwear varies widely in style, complexity and cost. [[Shoemaking]] is the process of making footwear. Originally, shoes were made one at a time by hand. Traditional [[handicraft]] shoemaking has now been largely superseded in [[Quantity|volume]] of shoes produced by [[industry|industrial]] [[mass production]] of footwear, but not necessarily in [[Quality (business)|quality]], attention to detail, or [[Artisan|craftsmanship]].

==Shoe styles==
Shoe designers have described a very large number of shoe styles&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pinterest.fr/pin/488992472034766607/ Pinterest - Visual Shoe Diectionary]&lt;/ref&gt;, namely :

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22391">The '''Mad Gasser of Mattoon''' (also known as the "Anesthetic Prowler," the "Phantom Anesthetist," or simply the "Mad Gasser") was the name given to the person or people believed to be responsible for a series of apparent [[gas attack]]s that occurred in [[Mattoon, Illinois]], during the mid-1940s. More than two dozen separate cases of gassings were reported to police over the span of two weeks, in addition to many more reported sightings of the suspected assailant. The gasser's supposed victims reported smelling strange odors in their homes which were soon followed by symptoms such as paralysis of the legs, coughing, nausea and vomiting.

Police remained skeptical of the accounts throughout the entire incident.&lt;ref name="Bartholomew1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartholomew|first1=Robert E.|last2=Victor|first2=Jeffrey S.|title=A Social-Psychological Theory of Collective Anxiety Attacks: The "Mad Gasser" Reexamined|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|date=Spring 2004|volume=45|issue=2|pages=229–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|235}} No physical evidence was ever found,&lt;ref name=johnson1&gt;{{cite journal

The attacks are widely considered to be simply a case of [[mass hysteria]].&lt;ref name="Bartholomew1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="johnson1"/&gt; However, others maintain that the Mad Gasser actually existed, or that the perceived attacks have another explanation, such as industrial pollution.

==Appearance==
Most contemporary descriptions of the Mad Gasser are based on the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Bert Kearney of 1408 Marshall Avenue, the victims of the first Mattoon case to be reported by the media. They described the gasser as being a tall, thin man dressed in dark clothing and wearing a tight-fitting cap.&lt;ref name=prowler1&gt;{{cite news

== Reported attacks ==
The first of the 1944 gasser incidents occurred at a house on Grant Ave., Mattoon, on August 31, 1944. Urban Raef was awakened during the early hours of the morning by a strange odor. He felt nauseated and weak, and suffered from a fit of vomiting. Suspecting that he was suffering from domestic gas poisoning, Raef's wife tried to check the kitchen stove to see if there was a problem with the pilot light, but found that she was partially paralyzed and unable to leave her bed.&lt;ref name=clark1/&gt;&lt;ref name=prowler1/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor1&gt;{{cite web

Later that night (some contemporary accounts refer to the time as the morning of the following day), a similar incident was also reported by a young mother living close by. She was awakened by the sound of her daughter coughing but found herself unable to leave her bed.&lt;ref name=clark1/&gt;

The next day, September 1, there was a third reported incident. A Mrs. Kearney, of Marshall Avenue, Mattoon, reported smelling a strong, sweet odor around 11:00 pm. At first she dismissed the smell, believing it to be from flowers outside of the window, but the odor soon became stronger and she began to lose feeling in her legs. Mrs. Kearney panicked and her calls attracted her sister, Mrs. Ready, who was in the house at the time. Mrs. Ready also noticed the odor, and determined that it was coming from the direction of the bedroom window, which was open at the time. The police were contacted, but no evidence of a prowler was found. At around 12:30 am,  Bert Kearney, Mrs. Kearney's husband (a local taxi driver who had been absent during the time of the attack), returned home to find an unidentified man hiding close to one of the house's windows. The man fled and Kearney was unable to catch him. Kearney's description of the prowler was of a tall man dressed in dark clothing, wearing a tight fitting cap. This description was reported in the local media, and became the common description of the gasser throughout the Mattoon incident.&lt;ref name=prowler1/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor1/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor2/&gt; After the attack, Mrs. Kearney reported suffering from a burning sensation on her lips and throat, which were attributed to the effects of the gas.&lt;ref name=clark1/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor2/&gt;

Initially, it was suspected that robbery was the primary motive for the attack. At the time of the incidents, the Kearneys had a large sum of money in the house, and it was surmised that the prowler could have seen Mrs. Kearney and her sister counting it earlier that evening.&lt;ref name=prowler1/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor1/&gt; Local newspapers incorrectly reported this incident as being the first gasser attack.&lt;ref name=prowler1/&gt;

In the days following the Kearney attack, there were half a dozen similar attacks (See table), though none of the purported victims were able to provide a clear description of the prowler, and no clues were found at the scene of the attacks. The first specimen of physical evidence was found on the night of September 5, when Carl and Beulah Cordes of North 21st Street returned home around 10:00 pm. After spending a few minutes in the house they noticed a piece of white cloth, slightly larger than a man's handkerchief, sitting on their porch next to the screen door. Beulah Cordes picked up the cloth and smelled it. As soon as she inhaled, she became violently ill. She described the effect as being similar to an electric shock. Her face quickly began to swell, she experienced a burning sensation in her mouth and throat, and began to vomit. As with other victims, she also reported feeling weak and experiencing partial paralysis of her legs. Beulah Cordes later hypothesized that the cloth had been left on the porch in order to knock out the family dog, which usually slept there, so that the prowler could gain access to the house unnoticed.&lt;ref name=cordes1&gt;{{cite news

 |archivedate = 2007-09-27
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the cloth, a skeleton key, described as looking "well used," was reportedly found on the sidewalk adjacent to the porch, along with a large, almost empty, tube of lipstick. The cloth was analyzed by the authorities, but they found no chemicals on it that could explain Beulah Cordes' reaction.&lt;ref name=clark1/&gt;&lt;ref name=time1/&gt;

The same night a second incident was reported, this time in North 13th Street, at the home of Mrs. Leonard Burrell. She reported seeing a stranger break in through her bedroom window and then attempt to gas her.

Public concern over the alleged gassings quickly rose, the FBI became involved, and the local police issued a statement calling on residents to avoid lingering in residential areas, and warning that groups set up to patrol for the gasser should be disbanded for reasons of public safety. Chief of Police C.E. Cole also warned concerned citizens to exercise due restraint when carrying or discharging firearms.&lt;ref name=manyfew&gt;{{cite news

 |archivedate = 2007-09-27
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, there was also an increase in physical evidence of attacks being reported, ranging from footprints allegedly being discovered underneath windows to tears being found in window screens.&lt;ref name=taylor1/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor2/&gt;

By September 12, local police had received so many false alarms (mostly from citizens believing that they smelled gas, or that they had seen a prowler) that they reduced the priority afforded to gasser reports and announced that the entire incident was likely the result of explainable occurrences exacerbated by public fears, and a sign of the anxiety felt by women while local men were on war service.&lt;ref name=taylor1/&gt;&lt;ref name=manyfew/&gt;&lt;ref name=falsealarm1/&gt;

After the police announcement, gasser reports declined. The only incident of arguable note after that date was the case of Bertha Burch, who claimed she saw a gasser who was a woman dressed as a man.&lt;ref name=clark1/&gt;

==Explanations==
There are three primary theories about the Mattoon Mad Gasser incident: mass hysteria, [[heavy industry|industrial]] [[pollution]], or an actual physical [[assailant]]. The events have also been written about by authors on the [[paranormal]].

===Mass hysteria===
Almost two weeks after the Mattoon attacks began, the local Commissioner of Public Health, Thomas V. Wright, announced that there had undoubtedly been a number of gassing incidents, but that many instances were likely due to hysteria: residents hearing of alarming events, and then panicking when confronted by an out-of-place odor or a shadow at the window; Wright stated:&lt;ref name=taylor1/&gt;

{{quote|There is no doubt that a gas maniac exists and has made a number of attacks. But many of the reported attacks are nothing more than hysteria. Fear of the gas man is entirely out of proportion to the menace of the relatively harmless gas he is spraying. The whole town is sick with hysteria.}}

On September 12, local Chief of Police C. E. Cole took Wright's hypothesis a step further, announcing that there had likely been no gas attacks at all, and that the reported incidents had probably been triggered by chemicals carried on the wind from nearby industrial facilities and then exacerbated by public panic.&lt;ref name=clark1/&gt;

Wright and Cole's diagnosis was given further validity in 1945 when the ''[[Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]]'' published "The 'phantom anesthetist' of Mattoon: a field study of mass hysteria" by Donald M. Johnson, which documented the Mattoon incident as a case study in [[mass hysteria]].&lt;ref name=johnson1/&gt; In 1959, his opinion was seconded by psychologist James P. Chaplin,&lt;ref name=jpchapli1&gt;{{cite book

Most of the physical symptoms recorded during the Botetourt and Mattoon incidents (including choking, swelling of mucus membranes, and weakness/temporary paralysis) have all been suggested symptoms of [[hysteria]].&lt;ref name=pierre1&gt;{{cite journal

 | publisher = Macmillan Pub Co
 | year = 1965
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some experts believe that the mass hysteria was fueled by the headline in the ''Mattoon Journal-Gazette'', "Mrs. Kearney and Daughter First Victims," which assumed there would be more attacks.

===Toxic waste or pollution===
On September 12, Chief of Police Cole told a press conference that odors and symptoms reported may have been the result of [[pollutant]]s or [[toxic waste]] released by nearby industrial plants, and speculated that [[carbon tetrachloride]] or [[trichloroethylene]], both of which have a sweet odor and can induce symptoms similar to those reported by purported gasser victims, may have been the substance released.&lt;ref name=clark1/&gt;&lt;ref name=falsealarm1&gt;{{cite news

 | url = http://www.eiu.edu/~localite/coles/mattoon/gasser/All's%20Quiet.htm
 | accessdate = 2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Cole's statement, [[Atlas-Imperial]], the primary company implicated in this affair, released a statement of its own saying that their facility had only five gallons of carbon tetrachloride in stock, which was contained in firefighting equipment. Atlas-Imperial officials also denied that any quantities of [[trichloroethylene]] (an industrial solvent used by Atlas) could be responsible for sickness in the town, reasoning that it would have taken significant quantities of the chemical to sicken the townspeople, and that factory workers would have experienced similar symptoms long before anybody outside of the factory was affected.&lt;ref name=falsealarm1/&gt;

At the time of the gassing, the Atlas plant had been certified as safe by the State Department of Health.&lt;ref name=falsealarm1/&gt;

===Actual assailant===
After analyzing events, some researchers have concluded that at least some of the gasser incidents were the work of an actual attacker who carried out a series of gassings as reported by witnesses.&lt;ref name=clark2/&gt;

===Other suggestions===
Some writers on the paranormal have covered the events. Clark (1993) describes an illustration of the Gasser from [[Loren Coleman]]'s ''Mysterious America'': "[the artist] depicts him as a not-quite-human, possibly [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]], being".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Clark | first = Jerome | authorlink = | title = Unexplained! 347 Strange Sightings, Incredible Occurrences, and Puzzling Physical Phenomena | publisher = Visible Ink Press | year = 1993 | location = Detroit | pages = 239 | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-8103-9436-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meditative poetry''' combines the religious practice of [[meditation]] with [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]. It occurs in many cultures, especially in Asian, European and Hindu cultures. Especially [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] writers have developed extensive theories and phase models for meditation (Bevis 1988;73-88).

In [[Christianity]], meditation became a major [[Catholic devotions|devotional]] practice during the [[Middle Ages]], closely associated with the life in [[monasteries]]. Definitions vary, but there were various attempts to distinguish meditation from [[contemplation]]. While meditation focuses the mind on a text, preferably from the [[Bible]], contemplation will take a concrete object, such as a candle, to concentrate the thoughts of the mind. Both, contemplation and meditation had the same end, to seek unity with God.

During the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], Jesuits like [[Ignatius of Loyola]] formalized the process of meditation, as a channeling of memory, understanding and will. His method of meditation fell into three main parts: A) prayer and composition of place; B) the examination of points ([[analysis]]); the colloquies (the dialogue with God as a climax) (Martz 1962, 27-32). [[Jesuits]] brought this practice to England (Daly 1978: 72). [[Calvinist]] and other Protestants adapted meditation to Bible studies.

[[Puritan]] meditation emphasized self-examination, applying Bible verses to contemporary, everyday life. In 1628, [[Thomas Taylor (priest, 1576–1633)|Thomas Taylor]] wrote a Puritan handbook ''Meditation from the Creatures'', recommending to include images from the sensible world (metaphorical of God's glory). In colonial [[New England]], [[Thomas Hooker]] defined meditation in ''The Souls Preparation for Christ'' (1632) as follows: "It is a settled exercise for two ends: first to make a further inquiry of the truth: and secondly, to make the heart affected therewith."

In 1648, the ''Shorter Catechism of the Westminster Assembly'' made meditation a duty for Puritans, and in 1649/50 [[Richard Baxter]]'s ''The Saints' Everlasting Rest'' became the standard Puritan text, at its core prescribing meditation. Like Taylor and Hooker, Baxter admitted the use of the senses, that is, he included contemplation with meditation, based on figural correspondences with the Bible. By including contemplation with meditation, the Puritans laid the foundation for a rich tradition of verse meditation in the USA from its colonial beginnings to the twenty-first century (Daly 1978, 74-76, 79-81; Martz 1962).

Soon Puritan ministers like [[Edward Taylor]] began to write meditations in verse, based on lines from the Bible and on sense perceptions, both [[allegorical]] of the greater glory of God. [[Anne Bradstreet]] provided the first published meditations purely based on the senses, celebrating nature's beauties as the creation of God. Using the [[analogy]] of Nature as God's second book, poetic meditations gradually secularized, replacing the early allegoric technique with a more [[symbol]]ic reading of nature and affirming the self-reliant individual (Pearce 1961, 42-57). 

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essay ''Nature'' (1836) freed the meditation from its theological underpinnings and its reliance on the Bible. He encouraged poets to view nature as a storehouse of symbols that they could use simply relying on their [[imagination]]. [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Emily Dickinson]] took meditation into this direction and paved the way for Modernist and Postmodernist practices in poetry (Lawson 1994).

The method of the three main steps (composition of place, examination of points, colloquies) had survived into the twentieth century in many poems, as had the devotional practice of verse meditation. Leading modernist poets like [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Wallace Stevens]] began to fragmentarize the process, blending thoughts and sense perceptions in a sort of spiritual diary (Parini 1993,12). Postmodernist poets like [[John Ashbery]] deconstruct the contemplative aspect, the [[reference]] of the poem to an object outside itself, dissolving [[narrative]] or [[Episode|episodic]] structures of the spiritual diary in an ironic and open association (Bevis 1988:280-90), and thereby turning the poem itself into the object the reader can use for contemplation or meditation. 

Meditative poetry has often been correlated to [[Relaxation Through Poetry]], which is simply using poetry to relax or relieve stress whenever someone is in need. It can also be seen in group visualization sessions where a speaker tries to get the audience to forget all about their stress by the use of calm and relaxing poetry.

'''Middle Dutch''' is a collective name for a number of closely related [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] dialects whose ancestor was [[Old Dutch]] and was spoken and written between 1150 and 1500. Until the advent of [[Modern Dutch]] after 1500, there was no overarching [[standard language]], but all dialects were mutually intelligible. During the period, a rich [[Medieval Dutch literature]] developed, which had not yet existed during [[Old Dutch]]. The various literary works of the time are often very readable for speakers of Modern Dutch since Dutch is a rather [[conservative (language)|conservative]] language. Nonlinguists often refer to Middle Dutch as [[Terminology of the Low Countries#From theodiscus|Diets]].

==Phonology==

===Differences with Old Dutch===
Several phonological changes occurred leading up to the Middle Dutch period.

* {{IPA|/uː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/yː/}}.
** This change did not occur in all dialects; in some, {{IPA|/uː/}} remained syllable-finally or before {{IPA|/w/}}.
* {{IPA|/iu/}} &gt; {{IPA|/yː/}}, merging with the phoneme originating from Old Dutch {{IPA|/uː/}}.
** This change did not occur in all dialects; some instead show {{IPA|/iu/}} merging with {{IPA|/io/}}. This results in later pairs such as ''dietsc'' {{IPA|/diətsk/}} versus ''duitsc'' {{IPA|/dyːtsk/}}.
** Various dialects also show {{IPA|/iw/}} &gt; {{IPA|/yw/}}, while others retain {{IPA|/iw/}}. Compare southeastern Middle Dutch ''hiwen'' {{IPA|/hiwən/}} with modern Dutch ''huwen'' {{IPA|/hywən/}}.
** In word-initial position, some northern dialects also show a change from a falling to a rising diphthong ({{IPA|/iu/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ju/}}) like [[Old Frisian]]. Cf. the accusative second-person plural pronoun ''iu'' {{IPA|/iu/}} &gt; northern ''jou'' {{IPA|/jɔu/}} versus southern ''u'' {{IPA|/yː/}}.
* Old Dutch {{IPA|/ie/}}, {{IPA|/ia/}}, {{IPA|/io/}} merge into a centralising diphthong {{IPA|/iə/}}, spelled {{angbr|ie}}.
* Likewise, Old Dutch {{IPA|/uo/}} (from [[Proto-Germanic]] {{IPA|/oː/}}) becomes a centralising diphthong {{IPA|/uə/}}, spelled {{angbr|oe}} or {{angbr|ou}}.
* Phonemisation of [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] for back vowels, resulting in a new phoneme {{IPA|/ʏ/}} (from earlier Old Dutch {{IPA|/u/}} before {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/j/}}). Unlike most other Germanic languages, umlaut was only phonemicised for short vowels in all but the easternmost areas; long vowels and diphthongs are unaffected.
* Voiceless fricatives become voiced syllable-initially: {{IPA|/s/}} &gt; {{IPA|/z/}}, {{IPA|/f/}} &gt; {{IPA|/v/}} (merging with {{IPA|/v/}} from Proto-Germanic {{IPA|/b/}}), {{IPA|/θ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ð/}}. (10th or 11th century)
* Vocal reduction: Vowels in unstressed syllables are weakened and merge into {{IPA|/ə/}}, spelled {{angbr|e}}. (11th or 12th century) Long vowels seem to have remained as such, at least {{IPA|/iː/}} is known to have remained in certain suffixes (such as ''-kijn'' {{IPA|/kiːn/}}).
* {{IPA|/ft/}} &gt; {{IPA|/xt/}}
* Dental fricatives become stops: {{IPA|/ð/}} &gt; {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/θ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/t/}}, merging with existing {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}. (around 12th century)
** The geminate {{IPA|/θθ/}} (originating from Germanic ''*-þj-'') develops into {{IPA|/ss/}}: ''*withtha'' &gt; ''wisse'', ''*smiththa'' &gt; ''smisse''.
* All remaining {{IPA|/u/}} &gt; {{IPA|/o/}}, except in the southeast.
* Along with the previous change, {{IPA|/uː/}}, {{IPA|/uw/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɔu/}}.
** This occurred only in those words where {{IPA|/uː/}} and {{IPA|/iu/}} had not developed into {{IPA|/yː/}} earlier. E.g. ''būan'' {{IPA|/buːan/}} &gt; ''bouwen'' {{IPA|/bɔu(w)ən/}}.
** The discrepancy in occurrences of {{IPA|/uː/}} resulted in pairs such as modern Dutch ''duwen'' {{IPA|/dywən/}} versus ''douwen'' {{IPA|/dɔu(w)ən/}}, or ''nu'' {{IPA|/ny/}} versus ''nou'' {{IPA|/nɔu/}}.
* [[L-vocalisation]]: {{IPA|/ol/}} and {{IPA|/al/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɔu/}} before dentals.
* Before dentals {{IPA|/ar/}} and {{IPA|/er/}} &gt; {{IPA|/aːr/}}, {{IPA|/or/}} &gt; {{IPA|/oːr/}}. E.g. ''farth'' {{IPA|/farθ/}} &gt; ''vaert'' {{IPA|/vaːrt/}}, ''ertha'' {{IPA|/erθa/}} &gt; ''aerde'' {{IPA|/aːrdə/}}, ''wort'' {{IPA|/wort/}} &gt; ''woort'' {{IPA|/woːrt/}}.
* [[Open syllable lengthening]]: Short vowels in stressed open syllables become long.
** In descriptions of Middle Dutch phonology, Old Dutch (original) long vowels are called "sharp-long" and indicated with a circumflex (â, ê, î, ô). Lengthened vowels are "soft-long" and are indicated with a macron (ā, ē, ī, ō).
** Lengthened vowels initially remained distinct from original long vowels, but â and ā usually merge early, and ī merges into ē. Thus, for Middle Dutch, only the distinction between ê/ô and ē/ō generally remains.
** {{IPA|/ʏ/}} lengthens to {{IPA|/œː/}} or {{IPA|/øː/}} (spelled {{angbr|o}}, {{angbr|eu}} or {{angbr|ue}}), but this does not result in any new phonemic contrasts until later on.
** As a result, all stressed syllables in polysyllabic words become [[Syllable weight|heavy]]. This also introduces many length alternations in grammatical paradigms, e.g. singular ''dag'' {{IPA|/dax/}}, plural ''dag(h)e'' {{IPA|/daːɣə/}}.

===Consonants===
The consonants of Middle Dutch differed little from those of Old Dutch. The most prominent change is the loss of dental fricatives. The sound {{IPA|[z]}} was also phonemicised during this period, judging from loanwords that retain {{IPA|[s]}} to this day.

Notes:

* All obstruents underwent [[final-obstruent devoicing]] as in Old and Modern Dutch.
* During the first part of the Middle Dutch period, [[Gemination|geminated]] varieties of most consonants still occurred. Geminated {{IPA|/ɣ/}} was a plosive {{IPA|/ɡɡ/}}, retained in modern Limburgish as {{IPA|/ɡ/}}.
* {{IPA|/m, p, b/}} were most likely [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]], whereas {{IPA|/f, v/}} were most likely [[Labiodental consonant|labiodental]].
* {{IPA|/n, t, d, s, z, l/}} could have been either dental {{IPA|[{{IPA link|n̪}}, {{IPA link|t̪}}, {{IPA link|d̪}}, {{IPA link|s̪}}, {{IPA link|z̪}}, {{IPA link|l̪}}]}} or alveolar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|n|n͇}}, {{IPA link|t|t͇}}, {{IPA link|d|d͇}}, {{IPA link|s|s͇}}, {{IPA link|z|z͇}}, {{IPA link|l|l͇}}]}}.
** {{IPA|/n/}} had a velar allophone {{IPAblink|ŋ}} when it occurred before the velars {{IPA|/k, ɣ/}}.
** After {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/ɣ/}} was realized as a plosive {{IPAblink|ɡ}}.
* {{IPA|/r/}} was most likely [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], either a [[Trill consonant|trill]] {{IPAblink|r|r͇}} or a [[Tap consonant|tap]] {{IPAblink|ɾ|ɾ͇}}.

===Vowels===
Most notable in the Middle Dutch vowel system, when compared to Old Dutch, is the appearance of phonemic rounded front vowels, and the merger of all unstressed short vowels.

====Short vowels====

* The exact height of {{IPA|/ʏ/}} is not certain, and may have varied between actual {{IPA|[ʏ]}} and a lower {{IPA|[ø]}} or even {{IPA|[œ]}}.
* {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} could have also been {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}}, as in modern Dutch.
* {{IPA|/a/}} was a back {{IPA|[ɑ]}} in most varieties, but front {{IPA|[a]}} probably occurred in some western dialects.

====Long vowels and diphthongs====
Long vowels and diphthongs cannot be clearly distinguished in Middle Dutch, as many long vowels had or developed a diphthongal quality, while existing diphthongs could also develop into monophtongs. Sometimes, this occurred only in restricted dialects, other developments were widespread.

* The rounded front vowels in brackets only occurred in the eastern dialects, where umlaut of long vowels and diphthongs occurred.
* The rounded back vowel {{IPA|/uː/}} only occurred in the Limburgish dialects.

Many details of the exact phonetics are uncertain, and seemed to have differed by dialect. The overall system is clear, however, as almost all the vowels remain distinct in modern Limburgish: {{IPA|/iː/}}, {{IPA|/iə̯/}}, {{IPA|/eɛ̯/}}, {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}} appear in modern Limburgish as {{IPA|/iː/}}, {{IPA|/eː/}}, {{IPA|/iə̯/}}, {{IPA|/æː/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}} respectively.

The vowels {{IPA|/ie̯/}}, {{IPA|/yø̯/}} and {{IPA|/uo̯/}} developed from Old Dutch opening diphthongs, but their exact character in Middle Dutch is unclear. The following can be said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/loey001midd03_01/loey001midd03_01_0005.php|title=A. van Loey, Middelnederlandse spraakkunst. Deel II. Klankleer · dbnl|trans-title=|language=|first=|last=DBNL|date=|website=DBNL|access-date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In eastern Brabant, and all of Limburg, the pronunciation remained diphthongal.
* {{IPA|/ie̯/}} is frequently found written with just {{angbr|i}}, which may indicate a monophthongal pronunciation. {{IPA|/ie̯/}} never merged with the long vowel {{IPA|/iː/}}, however, as no rhyme pairs between these vowels are found.
* In the coastal areas (Flanders, Holland), {{IPA|/uo̯/}} seems to have been a monophthong {{IPA|[oː]}} or {{IPA|[ʊː]}}. Before velar and labial consonants, the pronunciation was a close {{IPA|[uː]}}. This is revealed by the distinction in spelling between {{angbr|oe}} and {{angbr|ou}}.
* In western Brabant, the pronunciation of {{IPA|/uo̯/}} was more close, probably monophthongal {{IPA|/uː/}}.

The vowels {{IPA|/eɛ̯/}}, {{IPA|/øœ̯/}} and {{IPA|/oɔ̯/}}, termed "sharp-long" and denoted with a circumflex ''ê'' ''ô'', developed from Old Dutch long vowels. The opening diphthong pronunciation was probably widespread, and perhaps once universal, as it is nowadays still found in both West Flemish and in Limburgish, at opposite ends of the Middle Dutch language area. In the general area in between, including standard Dutch, the vowels merged with the "soft-long" vowels during the early modern Dutch period.
* In southern Flanders, southern Brabant and Holland, {{IPA|/eɛ̯/}} appears spelled with {{angbr|ie}} (e.g. ''stien'' for ''steen''), while {{IPA|/ie̯/}} appears with {{angbr|e}} (e.g. ''speghel'' for ''spieghel''), suggesting a merger between these phonemes.
* {{IPA|/oɔ̯/}} is sometimes found to rhyme with {{IPA|/oː/}}. It's possible that the two vowels merged under some conditions, while remaining distinct in other cases.
* In Brabant, {{IPA|/oɔ̯/}} occasionally rhymes with {{IPA|/uo̯/}}. In western Brabant, this implies a close monophthongal pronunciation {{IPA|[uː]}}.

The vowels {{IPA|/eː/}}, {{IPA|/œː/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}}, termed "soft-long" and denoted with a macron ''ē'' ''ō'', developed through the lengthening of Old Dutch short vowels in open syllables, but also frequently before {{IPA|/r/}}. They were simple monophthongs in all Middle Dutch dialects, with the exception of western Flanders where {{IPA|/eː/}} later developed into {{IPA|/ei̯/}}. They might have been close-mid but also perhaps open-mid {{IPA|[ɛː]}}, {{IPA|[œː]}} and {{IPA|[ɔː]}}, as in modern Limburgish.

There were two open vowels, with "sharp-long" ''â'' developed from the Old Dutch long ''ā'', and "soft-long" ''ā'' being the result of lengthening. These two vowels were distinguished only in Limburgish and Low Rhenish at the eastern end, and in western Flemish and coastal Hollandic on the western end. The relative backness of the two vowels was opposite in the two areas that distinguished them.
* On the coast, ''â'' was front {{IPA|/aː/}} or {{IPA|/æː/}}, while ''ā'' was central or back {{IPA|/ɑː/}}.
* In the eastern varieties, ''â'' was back {{IPA|/ɑː/}}, while ''ā'' was front or central {{IPA|/aː/}}. {{IPA|/ɑː/}} merged into {{IPA|/oː/}} during Middle Dutch, first in Low Rhenish, then later also in Limburgish further south.
* In all dialects between, the two vowels were not distinguished. The phonetic realisation ranged from back {{IPA|[ɑː]}} (in Brabant) to front {{IPA|[aː ~ æː]}} (Holland further inland).

The closing diphthong {{IPA|/ɛi̯/}} remained from the corresponding Old Dutch diphthong. It occurred primarily in umlauting environments, with {{IPA|/eɛ̯/}} appearing otherwise. Some dialects, particularly further west, had {{IPA|/eɛ̯/}} in all environments (thus ''cleene'' next to ''cleine''). Limburgish preserved the diphthong wherever it was preserved in High German.

The closing diphthong {{IPA|/ɔu̯/}} has two different origins. In the vast majority of the Middle Dutch area, it developed through [[l-vocalization]] from older {{IPA|/ol/}} and {{IPA|/al/}} followed by a dental consonant. In the eastern area, Limburg in particular, it was a remnant of the older diphthong as in High German, which had developed into {{IPA|/oɔ̯/}} elsewhere. L-vocalization occurred only in the modern period in Limburgish, and the distinction between {{IPA|/ol/}} and {{IPA|/al/}} was preserved, being reflected as ''ów'' and ''aa'' respectively.

===Changes during the Middle Dutch period===

Phonological changes that occurred during Middle Dutch:

* {{IPA|/mb/}} &gt; {{IPA|/mː/}}, {{IPA|/ŋɡ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ŋː/}}. This eliminated the sound {{IPA|/ɡ/}} from the language altogether.
** {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} originating from {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} through [[Final-obstruent devoicing|final devoicing]] were not affected. This therefore resulted in alternations such as singular ''coninc'' {{IPA|/koːniŋk/}} versus plural ''coninghe'' {{IPA|/koːniŋːə/}}, singular ''lamp'' {{IPA|/lamp/}} versus plural ''lammere'' {{IPA|/lamː(ə)rə/}}.
* {{IPA|/sk/}} &gt; {{IPA|/sx/}} (spelled {{angbr|sc}} or later {{angbr|sch}}). It's unclear when this change happened, as the spelling doesn't seem to differentiate the two sounds (that is, {{angbr|sc}} and {{angbr|sch}} could both represent either sound).
* {{IPA|/ɛ/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɛi/}} before {{IPA|/n/}} plus another consonant, merging with original Old Dutch {{IPA|/ɛi/}} (&lt; Proto-Germanic {{IPA|/ɑi/}}). E.g. ''ende'' &gt; ''einde'', ''pensen'' &gt; ''peinsen'' (from Old French ''penser''). This change is found sporadically in Old Dutch already, but becomes more frequent in some Middle Dutch areas.
* Epenthesis of {{IPA|/d/}} in various clusters of sonorants. E.g. ''donre'' &gt; ''donder'', ''solre'' &gt; ''solder'', ''bunre'' &gt; ''bunder''. In modern Dutch, this change has become grammaticalised for the ''-er'' (comparative, agent noun) suffix when attached to a word ending in -r.
* Shortening of geminate consonants, e.g. for ''bidden'' {{IPA|/bɪdːən/}} &gt; {{IPA|/bɪdən/}}, which reintroduces stressed light syllables in polysyllabic words.
* Early diphthongisation of long high vowels: {{IPA|/iː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɪi/}} and {{IPA|/yː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ʏy/}} except before {{IPA|/r/}}, probably beginning around the 14th century.
** The diphthongal quality of these vowels became stronger over time, and eventually the former merged with {{IPA|/ɛi/}} ''ei''. But the diphthongal pronunciation was still perceived as unrefined and 'southern' by educated speakers in the sixteenth century, showing that the change had not yet spread to all areas and layers of Dutch society by that time.
* Following the previous change, monophthongisation of opening diphthongs: {{IPA|/iə/}} &gt; {{IPA|/iː/}}, {{IPA|/uə/}} &gt; {{IPA|/uː/}}. The result might have also been a short vowel (as in most Dutch dialects today), but they are known to have remained long at least before {{IPA|/r/}}.
* Beginning in late Middle Dutch and continuing into the early Modern Dutch period, schwa {{IPA|/ə/}} was slowly lost word-finally and in some other unstressed syllables: ''vrouwe'' &gt; ''vrouw'', ''hevet'' &gt; ''heeft''. This did not apply consistently however, and sometimes both forms continued to exist side by side, such as ''mate'' and ''maat''.
** Word-final schwa was restored in the past singular of weak verbs, to avoid homophony with the present third-person singular because of word-final devoicing. However, it was lost in all irregular weak verbs, in which this homophony was not an issue: irregular ''dachte'' &gt; ''dacht'' (present tense ''denkt''), but regular ''opende'' did not become *''opend'' {{IPA|/oːpənt/}} because it would become indistinguishable from ''opent''.
* During the 15th century at the earliest, {{IPA|/d/}}{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} &lt;!-- guess it would be more probable if it was pronounced ð̞ at that time --&gt; begins to disappear when between a non-short vowel and a [[schwa]].
** The actual outcome of this change differed between dialects. In the more northern varieties and in Holland, the {{IPA|/d/}} was simply lost, along with any schwa that followed it: ''luyden'' &gt; ''lui'', ''lade'' &gt; ''la'', ''mede'' &gt; ''mee''. In the southeast, intervocalic {{IPA|/d/}} instead often became {{IPA|/j/}}: ''mede'' &gt; ''meej''.
** The change was not applied consistently, and even in modern Dutch today many words have been retained in both forms. In some cases the forms with lost {{IPA|/d/}} were perceived as uneducated and disappeared again, such as in ''Nederland'' and ''neer'', both from ''neder'' (the form ''Neerland'' does exist, but is rather archaic in modern Dutch).

==Dialects==

Middle Dutch was not a single homogenous language. The language differed by area, with different areas having a different pronunciation and often using different vocabulary. The dialect areas were affected by political boundaries. The sphere of political influence of a certain ruler also created a sphere of linguistic influence, with the language within the area becoming more homogenous. Following, more or less, the political divisions of the time, several large dialect groups can be distinguished. However, the borders between them were not strong, and a [[dialect continuum]] existed between them, with spoken varieties near the edges of each dialect area showing more features of the neighbouring areas.

===Brabantian===

[[Brabantian]] was spoken primarily in the [[Duchy of Brabant]]. It was an influential dialect during most of the Middle Ages, during the so-called "Brabantian expansion" in which the influence of Brabant was extended outwards into other areas. Compared to the other dialects, Brabantian was a kind of "middle ground" between the coastal areas on one hand, and the Rhineland and Limburg on the other. Brabantian Middle Dutch has the following characteristics compared to other dialects:

* Merger of â and ā, articulated as a back vowel.
* Use of the form ''g(h)i'' for the second-person plural pronoun.
* {{IPA|/ft/}} &gt; {{IPA|/xt/}}
* Early diphthongization of {{IPA|/iː/}} and {{IPA|/yː/}}.
* Tended towards Rhinelandic and/or Limburgish in the easternmost areas, with [[Umlaut (linguistics)|umlaut]] of long vowels and diphthongs. This in turn led to stronger use of umlaut as a grammatical feature, in for example diminutives.
* Lack of umlaut {{IPA|/a/}} &gt; {{IPA|/e/}} before {{IPA|/xt/}}, in western varieties.

===Flemish===

Flemish, consisting today of [[West Flemish|West]] and [[East Flemish]] and [[Zealandic]], was spoken in the [[County of Flanders]]. Though due to their intermediary position between West Flemish and [[Brabantian]], the East Flemish dialects have also been grouped with the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ed|first1=Keith Brown|title=Encyclopedia of Language &amp; Linguistics|date=2007|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0-08-044299-4|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flemish had been influential during the earlier Middle Ages (the "Flemish expansion") but lost prestige to the neighbouring Brabantian in the 13th century. Its characteristics are:

* Fronted realisation {{IPA|/æː/}} for â.
* Unrounding of rounded front vowels.
* Loss of {{IPA|/h/}}, with the occasional [[hypercorrection]] found in texts.
* Opening diphthong articulation of ê and ô, often spelled {{angbr|ee}} and {{angbr|oe}}.
* Old Dutch {{IPA|/iu/}} developed into {{IPA|/iə/}} instead of {{IPA|/yː/}}, thus giving forms such as ''vier'' ("fire") where other dialects have ''vuur''.
* Lowering of {{IPA|/e/}} to {{IPA|/a/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} + consonant, often also with lengthening. The change is generally limited to West Flemish before dentals, while before labials and velars it is more widespread.
* Lack of umlaut {{IPA|/a/}} &gt; {{IPA|/e/}} before {{IPA|/xt/}}.
* {{IPA|/i/}} &gt; {{IPA|/e/}} in some words.
* {{IPA|/o/}} &gt; {{IPA|/e/}} sometimes before {{IPA|/r/}} + consonant in West Flemish.

===Hollandic===

[[Hollandic]] was spoken in the [[County of Holland]]. It was less influential during most of the Middle Ages but became more so in the 16th century during the "Hollandic expansion", during which the [[Eighty Years' War]] took place in the south. It shows the following properties:

* Strong [[Ingvaeonic]] influence from earlier [[Frisians|Frisian]] presence in the area. This became more apparent closer to the coast and further north ([[West Friesland (historical region)|West Friesland]]).
* â and ā merged and had a fronted articulation (which forms the basis for the modern standard Dutch pronunciation).
* Occasional occurrence of the [[Ingvaeonic nasal-spirant law]]. Seen in some place names, such as ''-mude'' ("mouth") where more southwestern areas retain the nasal: ''-monde''.
* Use of the form ''ji'' for the second-person plural pronoun.
* Retention of {{IPA|/ft/}}.
* Lack of umlaut {{IPA|/a/}} &gt; {{IPA|/e/}} before {{IPA|/xt/}}.

===Limburgish===

[[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] was spoken by the people in the provinces of modern [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch]] and [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]]. It was not clearly tied to one political area, instead being divided among various areas, including the [[Duchy of Limburg]] (which was south of modern Limburg). It was also the most divergent of the dialects.

* Generally, a strong "southeastern" influence, tying it more to [[Middle High German]] in some respects ("Colognian expansion"). The effects of the [[High German consonant shift]] are occasionally found.
* [[Umlaut (linguistics)|umlaut]] affects all vowels and is morphologically significant.
* Retention of the older Germanic diphthongs {{IPA|/ɛi/}} and {{IPA|/ɔu/}} where other Middle Dutch dialects have monophthongized these to ê and ô.
* Retention of {{IPA|/u/}} (did not merge with {{IPA|/o/}}) and {{IPA|/uː/}} (remained as a back vowel).
* Orthography is also more eastern. {{angle|u}} represents a back vowel, and vowel length in closed syllables is not marked.
* Full use of ''du'' as the second-person singular pronoun.
* Long a in words ending in a single consonant, e.g. ''blaet'' for ''blat'', ''gaef'' for ''gaf'', etc. and before {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/x/}} + dental, 

===Rhinelandic===

Rhinelandic ("Kleverlands") was spoken around the area of the [[Duchy of Cleves]], around the [[Lower Rhine]]. It represented a transitional dialect between Limburgish and [[Middle Low German]].

* Like Limburgish, it had an eastern influence, with a more eastern-tinted orthography. Umlaut was a regular grammatical feature.
* Stronger [[Middle Low German]] influence.
* Back and often rounded articulation of â, with a tendency to confuse it with ō, a feature shared with Low German, to the north.

==Orthography==

Middle Dutch was written in the [[Latin alphabet]], which was not designed for writing Middle Dutch so different scribes used different methods of representing the sounds of their language in writing. The traditions of neighbouring scribes and their languages led to a multitude of ways to write Middle Dutch. Consequently, spelling was not standardised but was highly variable and could differ by both time and place as various "trends" in spelling waxed and waned. Furthermore, a word could be found spelled differently in different occurrences within the same text. There was the matter of personal taste, and many writers thought it was more aesthetic to follow French or Latin practice, leading to sometimes rather unusual spellings.

The spelling was generally phonetic, and words were written based on how they were spoken rather than based on underlying phonemes or morphology. [[Final-obstruent devoicing]] was reflected in the spelling, and [[clitic]] pronouns and articles were frequently joined to the preceding or following word. Scribes wrote in their own dialect, and their spelling reflected the pronunciation of that particular scribe or of some prestige dialect by which the scribe was influenced. The modern Dutch word ''maagd'' ("[[maiden]]") for example was sometimes written as ''maghet'' or ''maegt'', but also ''meget'', ''magt'', ''maget'', ''magd'', and ''mecht''. Some spellings, such as ''magd'', reflect an early tendency to write the underlying phonemic value. However, by and large, spelling was phonetic, which is [[logic]]al as people usually read texts out loud.

Modern dictionaries tend to represent words in a normalised spelling to form a compromise between the variable spellings on one hand and to represent the sounds of the language consistently. Thus, normalised spellings attempt to be a general or "average" spelling but still being accurate and true to the language.

===Vowels===

The general practice was to write long vowels with a single letter in an open syllable and with two letters in a closed syllable. Which two letters were used varied among texts. Some texts, especially those in the east, do not do so and write long vowels with a single letter in all cases (as is the predominant rule in modern German).

==Grammar==

===Nouns===
Middle Dutch nouns inflected for number as well as [[Grammatical case|case]]. The weakening of unstressed syllables merged many different Old Dutch classes of nominal declension. The result was a general distinction between strong and weak nouns. Eventually even these started to become confused, with the strong and weak endings slowly beginning to merge into a single declension class by the beginning of the modern Dutch period.

====Strong nouns====

The strong nouns generally originated from the Old Dutch a-stem, i-stem and u-stem inflections. They mostly had a nominative singular with no ending, and a nominative plural in ''-e'' or, for some neuter nouns, with no ending. Most strong nouns were masculine or neuter. Feminines in this class were former i-stems, and could lack an ending in the dative singular, a remnant of the late Old Dutch inflection. In some rare occasions, the genitive singular was also endingless. Some nouns ended in ''-e'' in the singular also; these were primarily former ja-stems, which were masculine or neuter. A few were former i-stems with short stems. Nouns of this type tended to be drawn into the weak inflection by analogy.

The following table shows the inflection of the masculine noun {{wikt-lang|dum|dach}} "day", feminine {{wikt-lang|dum|daet|dâet}} "deed" and neuter {{wikt-lang|dum|broot|brôot}} "bread".

|}

====Weak nouns====

Weak nouns were characterised by the ending ''-en'' throughout the plural. The singular ended in ''-e''.

The following table shows the inflection of the masculine noun {{wikt-lang|dum|bōge}} "bow, arc".

|}

===Adjectives===

Middle Dutch adjectives inflected according to the gender, case and number of the noun they modified.

The Germanic distinction between strong and weak, or indefinite and definite inflection, was fairly minimal in Middle Dutch, appearing only in the masculine and neuter nominative singular. These forms received an ''-e'' ending when a definite word (demonstrative, article) preceded, and had no ending otherwise. Adjectives were uninflected when connected through a copula. Thus, even for feminine nouns, no ending appeared: ''die vrouwe is goet'' "the lady is good".

Some adjectives, namely the former ja-stems, had an ''-e'' even in the strong and copular form, e.g. ''die vrouwe is clein'''e''''' "the lady is small".

===Pronouns===
Middle Dutch pronouns differed little from their modern counterparts. The main differences were in the second person with the development of a [[T-V distinction]]. The second-person plural pronoun ''ghi'' slowly gained use as a respectful second-person singular form. The original singular pronoun ''du'' gradually fell out of use during the Middle Dutch period. A new second person plural pronoun was created by contracting ''gij/jij'' and ''lui'' ('people') forming ''gullie/jullie'' (which this literally means 'you people').

===Verbs===
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}
Middle Dutch mostly retained the Old Dutch verb system. Like all Germanic languages, it distinguished [[Germanic strong verb|strong]], [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] and [[Preterite-present verb|preterite-present]] verbs as the three main inflectional classes. Verbs were inflected in present and past tense, and in three moods: indicative, subjunctive and imperative.

The weakening of unstressed vowels affected the distinction between the [[Indicative mood|indicative]] and [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] moods, which had largely been determined by the vowel of the inflectional suffix in Old Dutch. In Middle Dutch, with all unstressed vowels merging into one, the subjunctive became distinguished from the indicative only in the singular but was identical to it in the plural, and also in the past tense of weak verbs. That led to a gradual decline in the use of the subjunctive, and it has been all but lost entirely in modern Dutch.

====Strong verbs====
The seven classes of strong verb common to the Germanic languages were retained. The four principal parts were the present tense, first- and third-person singular past tense, remaining past tense, and the past participle.

In classes 6 and 7, there was no distinction between the two different vowels of the past tense. In classes 4 and 5, the difference was primarily one of length, since ''ā'' and ''â'' were not distinguished in most dialects. The difference between ''ê'' and ''ē'', and between ''ô'' and ''ō'', found in classes 1 and 2, was a bit more robust, but also eventually waned in the development to modern Dutch. Consequently, the distinction was mostly lost. Class 3, which retained a clear distinction that did not rely on vowel length, was levelled in favour of the ''o'' of the plural.

In classes with a lengthened vowel in the present, the singular imperative often appears with a short vowel instead, e.g. ''les'', ''drach''. An alternative form, with final ''-e'' by analogy with the weak verbs, also occurs.

The eastern dialects occasionally show ''i'' in the second- and third-person singular present indicative forms, instead of ''e''. This is a remnant of older i-mutation in these forms. Umlaut is also sometimes found in the past subjunctive in the east.

====Weak verbs====
Middle Dutch retained weak verbs as the only productive class of verbs. While Old Dutch still had two different classes of weak verbs (and remnants of a third), this distinction was lost in Middle Dutch with the weakening of unstressed syllables.

The past tense was formed with a suffix ''-ed-'', which generally lost its ''e'' through syncope and thus came to be directly attached to the preceding stem. This triggered voicing assimilation, so that ''t'' appeared whenever the preceding stem ended in a voiceless consonant. This phenomenon remains in modern Dutch. Unsyncopated forms, which retain the fuller suffix ''-ed-'', are sometimes found, especially with stems ending in a labial or velar consonant.

Some former class 1 weak verbs retained so-called ''[[Rückumlaut]]''. These verbs had undergone umlaut in the present tense, but the umlaut-triggering vowel was syncopated in the past tense already in Old Dutch, preventing umlaut from taking hold there. Thus, ''senden'' had the first- and third-person singular past tense ''sande''. These verbs tended to be reinterpreted as strong verbs in later Middle Dutch; ''sande'' itself gave rise to the modern ''zond'', mirroring strong class 3.

The '''music of [[Guam]]''' encompasses the works of many Chamorro popular musicians, including KACY, Flora Baza Quan, Daniel De Leon Guerrero, [[singer-songwriter]] J. D. Crutch, who is on the local Napu Records and who released a best-selling local album with ''Guinaifen Manglo''. The [[state song]] of Guam is "[[Guam Hymn]]" by [[Ramon Sablan]], adopted in 1919.{{Ref|statesong}} Flora Baza Quan is especially notable throughout the territory, and is known as the "Queen of Chamorro Music".{{Ref|quan}}

Modern music from Guam includes elements of [[Music of the Americas|American]], [[Spanish music|Spanish]], [[Filipino music|Filipino]] and [[Polynesian music]]. The Spanish and Mexicans contributed a type of song called ''serenatas'' to the [[culture of Guam]]. Some traditional Catholic songs in the Spanish language, including "Mil Albricias", "Pastores a Belen", "Santa Maria de la Merced" or "Nochebuena Noche Santa" and some traditional love songs including "A mi morena", "Ay que triste desventura", "Cancion de Antonio Acosta" or "Te quiero amar" are preserved.

== Music venues and institutions ==
Music institutions in Guam include the [[University of Guam]]'s Fine Arts Department, [[Guam Symphony Society]], [[Guam Choristers]], [http://www.cantateguam.com Cantate Guam], and the [[Gregorian Institute of Guam]]. The Guam Symphony Society was founded in 1967, and hosts concerts such as the Symphony Seaside Concert and the Musikan Famagu'on for children.{{Ref|GSS}} The two major local [[record label]]s are Napu Records and StelStar Records. In addition to the previously stated, there is the government sponsored [[Guam Territorial Band]]. The Guam territorial band hosts concerts yearly often free to the public, as well as representing Guam music on an international stage.

== Chamorro music ==
Traditional Chamorro instruments include the [[belembaotuyan]], a hollow [[gourd]] [[stringed instrument]], and the [[nose flute]]. [[Kantan]] singing is also popular. It is a kind of [[work song]], begun by one person teasing another in verse form, and then continuing through a group one individual in turn.

Chamorro [[chant]]s and [[Kantan Chamorrita]] (''Chamorrita singing''), a kind of Chamorro poetry, are also important elements of Guamanian music. Kantan Chamorrita is a kind of improvised poetry with a [[call and response]] format that is documented back to 1602 and remains a vital part of Chamorro culture. In Kantan Chamorrita, individuals and groups trade witty remarks at each other as part of a debate. These songs are "ancient folk songs, arranged in quatrains of two octosyllabic couplets, which, according to some writers, are composed on a single melody, the variations depending on the individual style of performance. The distinctive features are spontaneous improvisation and a dialogue performance between two or more people, depending on the occasion and function."{{Ref|quote}}

=== Performers ===
The musical duo Gus and Doll (Agusto Quichocho and his wife Josephine Sablan Quichocho) were prominent performers of Chamorro music, active until the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guampdn.com/article/20110801/ENTERTAINMENT02/108010302/The-return-Gus-Doll |title=The return of Gus and Doll &amp;#124; Pacific Daily News |publisher=guampdn.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificnewscenter.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=15550:gus-and-doll-to-perform-for-estorian-kantan-chamorro&amp;Itemid=156 |title=Pacific News Center |publisher=Pacific News Center |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Novoland''' ({{zh|c=九州|p=Jiǔzhōu}}), is a [[fictional universe]], with a known world of 3 continents and 9 provinces; divided into the prosperous Eastern Land and the nomadic Eight Tribes. It spans a history of 10000 years divided into 10 eras and about 16 dynasties.

There are 30 books written for this universe, with 7 principal authors writing novels for it. The project was started in early 2000s, inspired by the film  ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''.

==Geography==
===Northern Continent===

==== Shang Province (殇州) ====
The Shang Province is located in the West of the Northern Continent, and the land is mostly occupied by Titans. Shang is bounded on two sides by sea (Huan Sea &amp; _), and to the North is the vast snow-capped mountains of an ice cold continent; on the eastern border is the Han province and the Fire and Thunder Plains. It has an area of 25000km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Shang can be split into three main terrains: Shang Plains in the North, Mangu mountain ranges in the East, and Tianchi mountain ranges in the West. The Mangu mountain ranges are the tallest in the Northern Continent, with an average altitude of over 10000 chi (1 chi = 1/3 metre).

The Central and Eastern areas of Shang are mostly flat, and long periods of erosion have formed many vast and smoothly rolling plains with some small hills scattered throughout. The Western area is a volcanic belt, collectively named the Ice and Fire Earthsea, and has tens of large active volcanoes and many more smaller or dormant volcanoes. Even further West are volcanic island groups located in the Boundless Ocean.

This is a land of ice and fire, and the corresponding climates are changeable too. The Shang Plains have a cold climate, with low temperatures in summer and lots of rain. No matter if it is winter or summer, it can still rain or snow. The plains are not suitable for trees to grow, so shrubs and tundra and plants are the most common vegetation. The South-Western areas have plenty of geothermal energy, visible woody plants make up small forests, and weed meadows grow near hot springs and places protected form the wind. The climate of plains in the Central-Eastern area of Shang is slightly more complicated than the Han province, with mostly coniferous forests and little broadleaf trees. Forest steppes and grasslands are distributed along the Han border.

The Shang Prefecture is ruled by the Giants, long time enemies of the humans.

==== Han Province (瀚州) ====
Han is frequently translated as sorrow, spite, rancor, regret, resentment or grief, among many other attempts to explain a concept that has no English equivalent. The Han Province reflects this by being a barren and desolate land with only a small fertile area in the middle. The entrance / exit between the Han Province and Tianqi City of the Zhong Prefecture is protected by a fortress at the Shangyang Pass.

==== Ning Province (宁州) ====

=== Eastern Continent ===

==== Zhong Province (中州) ====
Ruled by the humans, its Capital is Tianqi City. The seven dynasties so far have been Zhao, Xi, Yin, Xie, Ben, Cheng, and Duan.

==== Lan Province (澜州) ====

==== Wan Province (宛州) ====

==== Yue Province (越州) ====

=== Western Continent ===

==== Yun Province (云州) ====

==== Lei Province (雷州) ====

'''''Prime''''' is a 2005 American [[romance film|romantic]] [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] starring [[Uma Thurman]], [[Meryl Streep]], and [[Bryan Greenberg]]. It was written and directed by [[Ben Younger]]. The film grossed $67,937,503 worldwide.

==Plot==
Rafi is a recently divorced, 37-year-old career woman from [[Manhattan]] who becomes romantically involved with David, a talented 23-year-old painter from the [[Upper West Side]]. Rafi shares all her secrets with her therapist Lisa who, unbeknownst to Rafi, is David's mother. Lisa is supportive of Rafi's relationship with a younger man before she learns who he is, discovers the connection and finds herself not only faced with the ethical and moral dilemma of counselling David's girlfriend, but also the reality that she feels differently about the relationship now that she knows her son is involved. Lisa consults her own therapist, and they decide that it is in the best interest of her patient Rafi for Lisa to continue treatment, as long as the relationship remains the "fling" it appears to be.

However, Lisa soon realizes that the relationship is serious, and tells Rafi that she is David's mother. Feeling embarrassed and betrayed, Rafi ends her treatment with Lisa. Their differences causing problems between them, Rafi and David break up. A couple of weeks later, David is enjoying a night on the town with his best friend; he gets drunk and ends up sleeping with Sue, Rafi's friend from work. The same day, after bumping into each other at the supermarket and going back to David's place, David and Rafi start seeing each other again. They also try to make the relationship stronger by going to a Friday night dinner with David's family. The rift between Rafi and Lisa is patched up, although Rafi brings up the possibility of her and David having children, to which Lisa reacts strongly. A few days later, Rafi discovers that David had slept with Sue, and David and Rafi fight. After sulking for some time, David goes to seek Lisa's help as both his mother and as a therapist. She advises him to do what he can to keep the relationship, because it was through Rafi that Lisa was able to understand David's career as an artist. David goes back to Rafi to apologize and offer to give her a child because that is what she wants the most. Rafi realizes how deep David's love must be for him to make such a sacrifice{{what|date=March 2018}}. Somehow, they both conclude that love is not enough to keep a relationship going, and they break up.

A year later, David and his friend{{who|date=March 2018}} are seen leaving the first restaurant where he and Rafi had their first proper date. Going back to retrieve his forgotten hat, David spots Rafi but she does not see him; he gets his hat, rushes out the door, and hides. He defrosts the glass a bit to watch her, and she turns around and sees him. They share a smile before parting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9834">A '''revolving stage''' is a mechanically controlled platform within a [[theatre]] that can be rotated in order to speed up the changing of a scene within a show. A fully revolving set was an innovation constructed by the hydraulics engineer [[Tommaso Francini]] for an elaborately produced pageant, ''Le ballet de la délivrance de Renaud'', which was presented for [[Marie de Medici]] in January 1617 at the Palais du Louvre and noted with admiration by contemporaries. Such a stage is also commonly referred to as a turntable.

== Kabuki theatre development ==
The first major use of revolving stages began in Japan during [[Kabuki]] performances.  In the 1750s, [[Namiki Shōzō I|Namiki Shōzō]], previously just known for his work as a theatrical dramatist in Japan, introduced a stage design known as a "mawari butai". The literal English translation is "revolving stage"; however, the denotation is quite different from the modern understanding of the word.  Initially, the stages were wheeled circular platforms that were fixed on a stage and turned manually.  A wall running through the diameter of the circle allowed a quick reveal of other Kabuki performers and chanters.  Although the platform did indeed revolve, the problems of visual scenic changers still hindered the spectacle.  Through trial and error methods involving the issues still at hand in the Kabuki theatre, the platform eventually became flush with the immobile sections of the stage. This in turn placed the mechanism below the stage and hid the manual labor.  After this downward shift, the manual technology only increased.  One circle, in the 1820s in Japan, was placed inside another circle and was used for various transitions.  Some special effects included one boat passing another by the two rings turning against each other.  This was just an example of many tricks that the Kabuki theatre developed.  Revolving stages were a huge step towards the stylized form Kabuki theatre is known for today.  They made it possible to depict supernatural transformations and use more creative entrances and exits.  Modern Kabuki theatre companies still employ a rotating stage but in a much smaller capacity.  For the most part, the wall on the circle is flush with the wall behind the chanters, and a rotation is used to allow new head chanters to be revealed seamlessly.

== Early western development ==
The first revolving stage in the western world was built by [[Karl Lautenschläger]] (1843–1906) in 1896 in [[Munich, Germany]]. Lautenschläger studied under Carl Brandt at the court theatre in Darmstad. From there he went to Munich, where he worked for 22 years and became the head machinist at the Royal theatre. He is known for his revolving stage, sometimes called the Lautenschläger stage, which later acquired the legacy of being called the new [[Shakespeare]] stage. The stage was installed at the Residenz Theatre for a performance of ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', an opera by [[Wolfgang Mozart]]. The revolve at the [[Residenz Theatre]] was fifty feet in diameter and was raised slightly off of the regular stage floor. With the proscenium, a little less than a fourth of the revolve was visible to the audience.  Lautenschläger used electricity to power the turntable, with the table turning on rollers, which ran on a circular track. This particular revolve was split into quarter sections and allowed four scenes to be set at the top of the show. The rotating stage allowed for depth, like landscapes with views in the distance and a more three-dimensional set in front of the walls of the revolve.

For theatres like the [[Dresden]], that did not have an underside to their stage, each sector of the revolve would have two wheels operating directly on the stage floor and propelled by a small motor fixed to the underside of the turntable. Some revolves had only two separate sections while some had as many as seven. Not all sections had to be split into equal proportions. Sections could be very shallow or very deep, according to what the scene required. Rectangular sections were even used many times for indoor scenes. Some revolves had sections that connected to each other to give the appearance of travel and help give the set perspective. Eventually traps, elevators and rotating stages combined in some theatres. The individual sections of the turntable could be lowered and raised to and from underneath the stage to make scene changes even more efficient.

In 1889 the Munich court theatre hired Lautenschläger to design a stage that was more efficient for Shakespearean productions, which required many changes of scenery. His rotating stage seemed to be the perfect solution. Other theatres and other companies performing Shakespeare quickly began to use the rotating stage, and it started to become known as the new Shakespeare stage. This was probably the biggest role for the rotating stage in its history.

=== Pros of early western designs ===

* As a designer lays out the taverns, houses, and cobblestone streets to have sectioned off on the circular set, he could imagine an actor walking from one location to the next as a part of the scene. Some directors even employed the rotation of the stage with a purposeful view from the audience allowing them to see the characters walk from one setting to the next.
* The sectioned design created wall structures to build usually costly sets on.  The structure provided for much more interesting scenic designs, especially when concerning the outdoor hills and mountains.  The angled frames of the stage dividers were often used to support tree structures or tall rolling hills.
* Time was the biggest problem solved by the revolving stage.  There was a particular problem with Shakespearean plays that required so many changes of scenery that some runs were as long as one could imagine a 20-act play would be.  Using the revolving stage, the scene changes were a fraction of their previous length.  It only took the time to rotate a 1/4 or even a 1/6 way around the circular stage.

=== Cons of early western design ===

* Angled walls often provided a problem.  It was impossible, as a scenic designer, to incorporate a horizon for anything on stage because there was no such back wall to support the perspective of it.
* The height of certain sets in certain sections proved to be an issue as well. When large buildings or tall constructions of the inside of a house were built in one section, they generally exceeded the length of the framing walls. When the stage spun, the audience could then see the buildings in other scenes.  This would offset other places such as the inside of a house or a wide-open field.
* The vibrations from the early designs of the mechanical revolving stage were off-putting in an auditorium.

== Present-day use ==

Today rotating stages are still in use, but benefit from the rise of automation in scenic design. ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' is one of the most notable modern uses of a rotating stage. It was recorded to have made sixty-three rotations in each performance during its original run in London. After being scrapped for the 25th anniversary revival, it has been reintroduced in the West End production. ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'' is also notable in its use of a double rotating stage, known as a concentric revolve, with one revolving stage inside of the other. This allows for more flexibility by having each rotate in different directions or at different speeds.

The revolving stage is also sometimes used at concerts and music festivals, especially larger ones, to allow one band to set up and check their equipment while another opening band is performing. This allows for a much faster transition between an opening band and the next one on the lineup.

It is common practice to reverse the rotation of a rotating stage as frequently as possible to prevent cables from becoming twisted, and eventually breaking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1643">The '''Reykjavík Theatre Company (RTC)''' was founded in 1897 when two existing companies in Reykjavík combined, performing in the then newly built [[Iðnó]] (Craftsmens' House). With [[Indriði Einarsson]] (1851-1939) as its Director, RTC became the fertile ground in which Iceland's professional theatre developed. Einarsson's dedication to professional theatre champion [[Sigurður Guðmundsson]]'s (1833-1874) vision of a permanent National Theatre was key in the evolution of Iceland's professional theatre.

==History==
RTC was the birthplace of Icelandic theatre,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} eventually giving rise to Iceland's National Theatre in 1950. Some of Iceland's most renowned talent, like [[Stefanía Guðmundsdóttir]] (1876-1926), played the RTC stage. RTC has had many Directors over the years, including [[Einar H. Kvaran]] (1859-1938), [[Sigurjónsson]], [[Indridi Waage]] (1902-1963), [[Lárus Pálsson]] (1914-1968), [[Gerd Grieg]], [[Stephensen]], [[Brynjólfur Jóhannesson]] (1897-1974) and [[Sveinn Einarsson]] (b. 1934). Einarsson took RTC into its modern professional era between 1963 and 1972, becoming Director of The National Theatre of Iceland in 1972. In 1989, RTC moved to the new City Theatre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10247">'''Riddle-tales''' (stories featuring riddle-contests) frequently provide the context for the preservation of ancient [[riddle|riddles]] for posterity, and as such have both been studied as a narrative form in their own right, and for the riddles they contain.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Christine Goldberg, ''Turandot's Sisters: A Study of the Folktale AT 851'', Garland Folklore Library, 7 (New York: Garland, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Such contests are a subset of wisdom contests more generally. They tend to fall into two groups: testing the wisdom of a king or other aristocrat; and testing the suitability of a suitor. Correspondingly, the [[Aarne–Thompson classification systems]] catalogue two main folktale-types including riddle-contests: AT 927, Outriddling the Judge, and AT 851, The Princess Who Can Not Solve the Riddle.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Goldberg, ''Turandot's Sisters: A Study of the Folktale AT 851'', Garland Folklore Library, 7 (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Such stories invariably include answers to the riddles posed: 'the audience cannot be left dangling'.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Goldberg, ''Turandot's Sisters: A Study of the Folktale AT 851'', Garland Folklore Library, 7 (New York: Garland, 1993), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The earliest example of a wisdom contest between kings is the Sumerian epic ''[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]'', from the first half of the second millennium BC, closely followed by the Egyptian ''[[The Quarrel of Apophis and Seqenenre]]'', fragmentarily attested in a thirteenth-century BC papyrus about [[Apepi (pharaoh)|the Pharaoh Apophis]] and [[Seqenenre Tao]]. ''The Quarrel of Apophis and Segenenre'' is echoed in the later ''[[Tale of Setne Khamwas and Si-Osire]]'', attested on papyrus in the Roman period, showing that this type of story continued to circulate in Egypt. However, these tales do not involve riddles as such.&lt;ref&gt;Ioannis M. Konstantakos, "Trial by Riddle: The Testing of the Counsellor and the Contest of Kings in the Legend of Amasis and Bias", ''Classica et Mediaevalia'', 55 (2004), 85–137 (pp. 87 n. 3, 89–90).&lt;/ref&gt;

These Egyptian stories, probably via lost Greek material, seem to have been an inspiration for the account of a wisdom-contest between Pharaoh [[Amasis II]] and the king of Ethiopia, in which the sage [[Bias of Priene]] helps the Pharaoh by solving the riddles, in [[Plutarch]]'s first- or second-century AD ''[[Convivium Septem Sapientium]]''. At least one of Plutarch's sources was probably shared by the ''Aesop Romance'', which originated around the fourth century BC (chs 102-8, 111–23). The ''Aesop Romance'' also drew on similar stories of wisdom contests in various versions of the ''[[Story of Ahikar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ioannis M. Konstantakos, "Trial by Riddle: The Testing of the Counsellor and the Contest of Kings in the Legend of Amasis and Bias", ''Classica et Mediaevalia'', 55 (2004), 85–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5716">'''Risk inclination (RI)''' is defined as a mental disposition (i.e., confidence) toward an eventuality (i.e., a predicted state) that has consequences (i.e., either loss or gain). The '''risk inclination model (RIM)''' is composed of three constructs: confidence weighting, restricted context, and the risk inclination formula. Each of these constructs connects an outside observer with a respondent’s inner state of risk taking toward knowledge certainty.

[[File:Risk Inclination Model (RIM).jpg|thumb|'''RIM''']]

==Confidence weighting==
{{Main|Confidence weighting}}
The [[Confidence weighting|confidence weighting ('''CW''')]] construct is concerned with indices that connect an outside observer to the respondent’s inner state of knowledge certainty toward specific content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ebel |first=R.L. |title=Confidence Weighting and Test Reliability |journal=[[Journal of Educational Measurement]]|volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-3984.1965.tb00390.x |pages=49–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Kenneth D. |author2=A.

==Restricted context==

The restricted context ('''RC''') construct is based on [[Jean Piaget]]’s theory of equilibration&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book 
|title=Handbook of Child Psychology 
|last=Piaget 
|first=J. 
|year=1983 
|publisher=Wiley 
|location=New York
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and allows the outside observer to measure the way a respondent manages competing inner states of knowledge certainty during the application of confidence weights among items within the restricted total point value (TPV) context of the test. RC sets the parameters where risk taking toward knowledge certainty occurs. These parameters are important because they allow an observer to scale and thereby measure the respondent’s inner state of equilibration among related levels of knowledge certainty. Equilibration is defined as a self-regulatory process that reflects the biological drive to produce an optimal state of balance between a person’s cognitive structures (i.e., inner state) and their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first=R. M.|title=Piaget and Vygotsky revisited: Dialogue or assimilation?|journal=Developmental Review|year=1995|volume=15|pages=458–472|doi=10.1006/drev.1995.1019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk inclination formula==

The [[risk inclination formula]] ('''RIF''') construct is based upon [[Varignon's theorem]] and quantifies feelings of rightness toward knowledge certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/recordDetails.jsp?searchtype=basic&amp;pageSize=10&amp;ERICExtSearch_Facet_0=facet_au&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=Brady+Michael+Jack&amp;ERICExtSearch_FacetValue_0=%22Jack%2C+Brady%22&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=au&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;objectId=0900019b8046c889&amp;accno=ED519174&amp;_nfls=false |title=Utilitarian Model of Confidence Testing for Knowledge-based Societies |last1=Jack |first1=B.M. |last2=Hung |first2=K.M.|last3=Liu |first3=C.J.|last4=Chiu |first4=H.L.|publisher=ERIC |id= ED519174}},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Coxeter|Coxeter, H.

Amer., pp. 52&amp;ndash;54, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; RIF uses the Principle of Moments or Varignon’s Theorem to calculate the first factorial moment of probability in order to define this center point of balance among all confidence weights (i.e., the point of Risk Equilibration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coxeter|first=H.

The '''rum ration''' (also called '''tot''') was a daily amount of [[rum]] given to sailors on [[Royal Navy]] ships. It was abolished in 1970 after concerns that regular intakes of alcohol would lead to unsteady hands when working machinery.

== Tradition ==
The rum ration, or "tot", consisted of {{convert|1/8|imppt|mL|sigfig=2|spell=in|adj=pre|of an}} of rum at 95.5 [[Alcohol proof|proof]] (54.6% [[ABV]]), given out to every sailor at midday. Senior ratings (petty officers and above) received their rum neat, whilst for junior ratings it was diluted with two parts of water to make {{convert|3/8|imppt|mL|sigfig=3|spell=in|adj=pre|of an}} of grog.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|last=Colls |first=Tom |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8859000/8859506.stm |title=What did they do with the drunken sailor? |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-07-30 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rum ration was served from one particular barrel, also known as the "Rum Tub", which was ornately decorated and was made of oak and reinforced with brass bands with brass letters saying "The Queen,  God Bless Her".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishcityguide.com/#/the-royal-yacht-britannia/4561137419 |title=The Royal Yacht Britannia |publisher=Scottish City Guide |date= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all sailors necessarily drew their rum: each had the option to be marked in the ship's books as "G" (for Grog) or "T" (for Temperance, if they were members of the [[Temperance Movement]]). Sailors who opted to be "T" were given three pence (3d) a day instead of the rum ration, although most preferred the rum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Charles | last = Gibowicz  | title = Mess Night Traditions| publisher = AuthorHouse  | location =  | year = 2007| isbn = 1425984487 | page = 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The time when the rum ration was distributed was called "Up Spirits", which was between 11&amp;nbsp;am and 12&amp;nbsp;noon.  A common cry from the sailors was "Stand fast the Holy Ghost". This was in response to the [[bosun's call]] "Up Spirits". Each mess had a "Rum Bosun" who would collect the rum from the officer responsible for measuring the right number of tots for each mess. The officers did not get a rum ration. 

Tot glasses were kept separate from any other glasses. They were washed on the outside, but never inside, in the belief that residue of past tots would stick to the side of the glass and make the tot even stronger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rob Peake |url=http://www.yachtingmonthly.com/news/493494/ceremony-to-mark-ending-of-rum-tot-at-hms-victory |title=Ceremony to mark ending of rum tot at HMS Victory |publisher=Yachting Monthly |date=2010-07-29 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sailors under 20 were not permitted a rum ration, and were marked on the ship's books as "UA" (Under Age).&lt;ref name=carrib /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:HMS Belfast 7.JPG|thumb|Measuring out the tot (diorama aboard {{HMS|Belfast|C35|6}})]]
A sailor's ration of alcohol was originally beer with a daily ration of one gallon (i.e. eight pints).  This official allowance continued until after the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  When beer was not available, as it would often spoil easily, it could be substituted by a pint of wine or half a pint of spirits depending on what was locally available.  In later years, the political influence of the West Indian planters led to rum being given the preference over [[arrack]] and other spirits. The half pint of spirits was originally issued neat; it is said that sailors would "[[Alcohol proof|prove]]" its strength by checking that gunpowder doused with rum would still burn (thus verifying that rum was at least 57% ABV). 

The practice of compulsorily diluting rum in the proportion of half a pint to one quart of water (1:4) was first introduced in the 1740s by Admiral [[Edward Vernon]] (known as Old Grog, because of his habitual [[grogram]] cloak).&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, J. ''Feeding Nelson's Navy''. Chatham Publishing. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Navy Victually Board Regulations and Instructions'', 14th edition, 1806. quoted Macdonald&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodger, N. ''The Wooden World: An Anatomy of the Georgian Navy''. William Collins. 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  The ration was also split into two servings, one between 10 am and noon and the other between 4 and 6 pm. In 1756 Navy regulations required adding small quantities of lemon or lime juice to the ration, to prevent [[scurvy]].&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=And a Bottle of Rum: A History of the New World in Ten Cocktails|author=Wayne Curtis|pages=57-58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rum itself was often procured from distillers in Jamaica, [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago]] and the [[British Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref name=carrib&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caribbean-beat.com/issue-104/last-days-drunken-sailor |title=Last days of the drunken sailor |publisher=Caribbean Beat |date=2010-07-31 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rations were cut in half in 1823 and again in half, to the traditional amount, in 1850.

The abolition of the rum ration had been discussed in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in 1850 and again in 1881 however nothing came of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1881/aug/13/navy-sobriety-resolution#S3V0264P0_18810813_HOC_5 |title=NAVY (SOBRIETY).—RESOLUTION. (Hansard, 13 August 1881) |publisher=Hansard |date=1881-08-13 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Admiral [[Peter Hill-Norton]] abolished the rum ration as he felt it could have led to sailors failing a breathalyser test and being less capable to manage complex machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dan van der Vat |authorlink = Dan van der Vat|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/may/20/guardianobituaries1 |title=Obituary: Admiral of the Fleet Lord Hill-Norton |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2004-05-20|accessdate=2012-07-03 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision to end the rum ration was taken after the [[Secretary of State for Defence]] had taken opinions from several ranks of the Navy. Ratings were instead allowed to purchase beer, and the amount allowed was determined, according to the MP [[David Owen]], by the amount of space available for stowing the extra beer in ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1970/jan/19/rum-ration#S5CV0794P0_19700119_CWA_277 |title=Rum Ration (Hansard, 19 January 1970) |publisher=Hansard |date=1970-01-19 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last rum ration was on 31 July 1970 and became known as [[Black Tot Day]] as sailors were unhappy about the loss of the rum ration. There were reports that the day involved  sailors throwing tots into the sea and the staging of a mock funeral in a training camp.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; In place of the rum ration, sailors were allowed to buy three {{convert|1/2|imppt|mL|spell=in}} cans of beer a day and improved recreational facilities.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; While the rum ration was abolished, the order to "[[splice the mainbrace]]", awarding sailors an extra tot of rum for good service, remained as a command which could only be given by the Monarch and is still used to recognise good service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/Sailors-splice-mainbrace-toast-Queen/story-16470025-detail/story.html |title=Sailors splice the mainbrace to toast Queen |publisher=This is Somerset |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rum rations are also given on special occasions: in recent years, example included the 100th anniversary of the Canadian Royal Navy in 2010 and after the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012.

== In other navies ==
In the [[United States Navy]], the daily ration was {{convert|1/2|USpt|ml|spell=in}} of [[distilled spirits]] until 1842, when it was reduced to {{convert|1|USgi|ml|spell=in}}. It was abolished in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/a/alcohol-in-the-navy.html |title=Alcohol in the Navy |publisher=United States Naval Historical Center|date= |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the [[Royal Australian Navy]] never issued the rum ration, their sailors were entitled to the rum ration when they were on Royal Navy ships until 1921.&lt;ref name="social"&gt;{{cite book | first = Ian | last = Williams  | title = Rum: A Social and Sociable History of the Real Spirit of 1776| publisher = Nation Books | location =  | year = 2006| isbn = 1560258918  | page = 243}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Royal Canadian Navy]] abolished the rum ration in 1972,&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; and the last navy to issue the rum ration regularly, the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]], abolished the practice on 28 February 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz-herald-auckland-anniversary-regatta/news/article.cfm?c_id=743&amp;objectid=114161 |title=Frigate guests get shot at sailors' rum ritual |publisher=New Zealand Herald |date= 2000-01-26|accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuestra Señora de la Santa Muerte''' ({{IPA-es|ˈnwestra seˈɲora ðe la ˈsanta ˈmweɾte|lang}}) ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for '''Our Lady of Holy Death'''), often shortened to '''Santa Muerte''', is a female [[deity]] or [[folk saint]] in Mexican and Mexican-American [[folk Catholicism]]. A [[personification of death]], she is associated with healing, protection, and safe delivery to the [[afterlife]] by her devotees.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|pp=6–7}} Despite condemnation by leaders of the [[Catholic Church]], her religion has become increasingly prominent since the turn of the 21st century.

Since the [[pre-Columbian era]] Mexican culture has maintained a certain reverence towards death,&lt;ref name="peña"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Araujo Peña |first=Sandra Alejandro |author2=Barbosa Ramírez Marisela |author3=Galván Falcón Susana |author4=García Ortiz Aurea |author5=Uribe Ordaz Carlos |title=El culto a la Santa Muerte: un estudio descriptivo |trans-title=The Santa Muerte Cult:A descriptive study |journal=Revista Psichologia |publisher=Universidad de Londres |location=Mexico City |url=http://www.udlondres.com/revista_psicologia/articulos/stamuerte.htm |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be seen in the widespread commemoration of the [[Day of the Dead]].&lt;ref name="MRamirez"&gt;{{cite news |title='Saint Death' comes to Chicago |first=Margaret |last=Ramirez  |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/death-chicago-08,0,2114588.story |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of that celebration include the use of skeletons to remind people of their mortality.&lt;ref name="Garma"&gt;{{cite news |title=El culto a la Santa Muerte |first=Carlos |last=Garma |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/590196.html |publisher=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=2009-04-10 |accessdate=2009-10-07 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The cult of Santa Muerte}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worship of Santa Muerte is condemned by the [[Roman Catholicism in Mexico|Catholic Church]] in Mexico as invalid, but it is increasingly firmly entrenched in Mexican culture.&lt;ref name="gray"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130512-vatican-santa-muerte-mexico-cult-catholic-church-cultures-world/|title=The Vatican and Santa Muerte|date=14 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Muerte generally appears as a skeletal female figure, clad in a long robe and holding one or more objects, usually a [[scythe]] and a [[globe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://66.226.4.226/programs/madeleine-brand/2012/01/10/22062/los-angeles-believers-in-la-santa-muerte-say-they- |title=Los Angeles believers in La Santa Muerte say they aren't a cult &amp;#124; The Madeleine Brand Show &amp;#124; 89.3 KPCC |publisher=66.226.4.226 |date=2012-01-10 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her robe can be of any color, as more specific images of the figure vary widely from devotee to devotee and according to the rite being performed or the petition being made.&lt;ref name="oriana1318"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Velazquez |first1=Oriana |title= El libro de la Santa Muerte |trans-title=The book of Santa Muerte |year=2007 |publisher=Editores Mexicanos Unidos, S.A. |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |isbn=978-968-15-2040-3 |pages=13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the worship of Santa Muerte was clandestine until the 20th century, most prayers and other rites have been traditionally performed privately at home.&lt;ref name="Garma"/&gt;  Since the beginning of the 21st century, worship has become more public, especially in [[Mexico City]] after a believer called Enriqueta Romero initiated her famous Mexico City shrine in 2001.&lt;ref name="Garma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Villarreal"&gt;{{cite news |title=La Guerra Santa de la Santa Muerte |first=Hector |last=Villarreal |url=http://semanal.milenio.com/node/331 |newspaper=Milenio semana |publisher=Milenio |location=Mexico City |date=2009-04-05 |accessdate=2009-10-07 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Holy War of Santa Muerte |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016071830/http://semanal.milenio.com/node/331 |archivedate=2009-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chesnut"&gt;Devoted to Death: Santa Muerte, the Skeleton Saint, R. Andrew Chesnut, OUP, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The number of believers in Santa Muerte has grown over the past ten to twenty years, to an estimated 10-20 million followers in Mexico, the United States, and parts of Central America. Santa Muerte has similar male counterparts in the Americas, such as the skeletal folk saints [[San La Muerte]] of Paraguay and [[Rey Pascual]] of Guatemala.&lt;ref name="Chesnut"/&gt;

[[File:Dec1Romero15.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Devotees praying to Santa Muerte, Mexico.]]
The deity's Spanish name, ''Santa Muerte'', can be translated into English as either "Sacred Death" or "Holy Death", although religious studies scholar R. Andrew Chesnut believed that the former was a more accurate translation because it "better reveals" her identity as a folk saint.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=7}}&lt;ref name="gray"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gray |first=Steven |date=2007-10-16 |title=Santa Muerte: The New God in Town |journal=Time.com |publisher=Time |location=Chicago |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1671984,00.html |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of this is ''Santísima Muerte'', which is translated as "Most Holy Death" or "Most Saintly Death",{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=7}} and devotees often call her ''Santisma Muerte'' during their rituals.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=7}}

Santa Muerte is also known by a wide variety of other names: the Skinny Lady (''la Flaquita''),{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=3}} the Bony Lady (''la Huesuda''),{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=3}} the White Girl (''la Niña Blanca''),{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=5}} the White Sister (''la Hermana Blanca''),{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=7}} the Pretty Girl (''la Niña Bonita''),{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=8}} the Powerful Lady (''la Dama Poderosa''),{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=8}} the Godmother (''la Madrina''),{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=5}} ''Señora de las Sombras'' ("Lady of Shadows"), ''Señora Blanca'' ("White Lady"), ''Señora Negra'' ("Black Lady"), ''Niña Santa'' ("Holy Girl"), ''Santa Sebastiana'' ("Saint Sebastienne", i.e. "Holy [[Saint Sebastian|Sebastian]]") or ''Doña Bella Sebastiana'' ("Beautiful Lady Sebastienne") and ''La Flaca'' ("The Skinny Woman").&lt;ref name="oriana0709"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Velazquez |first1=Oriana |title=El libro de la Santa Muerte |trans-title=The book of Santa Muerte |year=2007 |publisher=Editores Mexicanos Unidos, S.A. |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |isbn=978-968-15-2040-3 |pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mictlancihuatl 3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Mictecacihuatl]] (or [[Mictlancihuatl]]) the [[skeleton|skeletal]] [[Aztec religion|Aztec]] [[goddess]] of [[death]].]]
Although the origins of the worship of Our Lady of Holy Death are subject to debate,  it is most likely a [[syncretism]] between pre-Columbian Mesoamerican religion and Spanish culture.&lt;ref name="gray"/&gt; Mesoamerica had always maintained a certain reverence towards death, which manifested itself among the religious practices of ancient Mexico, including in the [[Aztec religion]]. Death was [[Death (personification)|personified]] in Aztec and other cultures in the form of humans with half their flesh missing, symbolizing the duality of life and death. From their ancestors the Aztecs inherited the gods [[Mictlantecuhtli]] and [[Mictecacihuatl]], the lord and lady of [[Mictlan]], the realm of those dead who died of natural causes. In order for the deceased to be accepted into Mictlan, offerings to the lord and lady of death were necessary. In European Christian tradition, many paintings employed skeletons to symbolize human mortality.&lt;ref name="Garma"/&gt;

[[INAH]] researcher Elsa Malvido Miranda notes that the worship of skeletal figures has precedent in Europe during times of epidemics. They would be dressed up as royalty with scepters and crowns, and be seated on thrones to symbolize the triumph of death.&lt;ref name="Pacheco"&gt;{{cite news |title=El culto a la Santa Muerte pasa de Tepito a Coyoacán y la Condesa |first=Ricardo |last=Pacheco Colín |url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?idc=114661 |newspaper=La Cronica de Hoy |location=Mexico City |accessdate=2009-10-07 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Santa Muerte cult moves from Tepito to Coyoacan and Condesa}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Latin America]], the human skeleton was used to remind Catholics of the need for a "holy death," (''muerte santa'') fully [[Confession (religion)|confessed]] of sins. As relics, bones are also associated with certain saints, such as San Pascual Bailón in Guatemala and [[Chiapas]].&lt;ref name="Garma"/&gt;

After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], the worship of death diminished but was never eradicated.&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt; John Thompson of the [[University of Arizona]]'s Southwest Center has found references dating to 18th-century Mexico. According to one account, recorded in the annals of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], indigenous people in central Mexico tied up a skeletal figure, whom they addressed as "Santa Muerte," and threatened it with lashings if it did not perform miracles or grant their wishes.&lt;ref name="Chesnut"/&gt; Another syncretism between [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] and Christian beliefs about death can be seen in Day of the Dead celebrations. During these celebrations, many Mexicans flock to cemeteries to sing and pray for friends and family members who have died. Children partake in the festivities by eating [[chocolate]] or [[Calavera|candy in the shape of skulls]].&lt;ref name="MRamirez"/&gt;

In contrast to the [[Day of the Dead]], overt veneration of Santa Muerte remained clandestine until the middle of the 20th century. When it went public in sporadic occurrences, reaction was often harsh, and included the desecration of shrines and altars.&lt;ref name="Chesnut"/&gt; At the beginning of the 20th century, [[José Guadalupe Posada]] created a similar, but secular figure by the name of [[La Calavera Catrina|Catrina]], a female skeleton dressed in fancy clothing of the period.&lt;ref name="Garma"/&gt; Posada began to evoke the idea that the universality of death generated a fundamental equality amongst man. His paintings of skeletons in daily life and that La Catrina were meant to represent the arbitrary and violent nature of an unequal society.&lt;ref name="Fragoso"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fragoso|first=Perla|title=De la "calavera domada" a la subversión santificada. La Santa  Muerte, un nuevo imaginario religioso en México}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern artists began to reestablish Posada's styles as a national artistic objective to push the limits of upper-class tastes; an example of Posada's influence is [[Diego Rivera]]'s mural painting ''[[Sueño de una Tarde Dominical en la Alameda Central|Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the Alameda Central]]'', which features La Catrina. The image of the skeleton and the Day of the Dead ritual that used to be held underground became commercialized and domesticated. The skeletal images became that of folklore, encapsulating Posada's viewpoit that death is an equalizer.&lt;ref name="Fragoso"/&gt;

Skeletons were put in extravagant dresses with braids in their hair, altering the image of Posada's original La Catrina. As opposed to being the political message Posada intended, the skeletons of equality became skeletal images which were appealing to tourists and the national folkloric Mexican identity.&lt;ref name="Fragoso"/&gt;

Veneration of Santa Muerte was documented in the 1940s in working-class neighborhoods in Mexico City such as [[Tepito]].&lt;ref name="trece"&gt;{{cite web |title=La Santa Muerte de Tepito cumple seis años |url=http://www.radiotrece.com.mx/2007/11/01/la-santa-muerte-de-tepito-cumple-seis-anos/ |publisher=Radio Trece |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Santa Muerte of Tepito turns six |accessdate=2009-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206175606/http://radiotrece.com.mx/2007/11/01/la-santa-muerte-de-tepito-cumple-seis-anos |archive-date=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources state that the revival has its origins around 1965 in the state of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]. At present Santa Muerte can be found throughout Mexico and also in parts of the United States and Central America.&lt;ref name="Chesnut"/&gt; There are videos, web sites, and music composed in honor of this folk saint.&lt;ref name="Garma"/&gt; The religion of Santa Muerte first came to widespread popular attention in Mexico in August 1998, when police arrested notorious gangster [[Daniel Arizmendi López]] and discovered a shrine to the saint in his home. Widely reported in the press, this discovery inspired the common association between Santa Muerte, violence, and criminality in Mexican popular consciousness.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|pp=15–16}}

Since 2001, there has been a "meteoric growth" in the size of the Santa Muerte beliefs, largely due to her reputation for performing miracles.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=8}}
Worship has been made up of roughly two million adherents, mostly in the [[State of Mexico]], [[Guerrero]], Veracruz, [[Tamaulipas]], [[Campeche]], [[Morelos]], and Mexico City, with a recent spread to [[Nuevo León]].&lt;ref name="Garma"/&gt; In the late 2000s, the founder of Mexico City's first Santa Muerte church, David Romo, estimated that there were around 5 million devotees in Mexico, constituting approximately 5% of the country's population.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|pp=8–9}}

By the late 2000s Santa Muerte had become Mexico's second-most popular saint, after [[Jude the Apostle|Saint Jude]],{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=4}} and had come to rival the country's "national patroness", the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]].{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=8}} The religion's rise was controversial, and in March 2009 the Mexican army demolished 40 roadside shrines near the U.S. border.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=4}} Circa 2005, the Santa Muerte religion was brought to the United States by Mexican and Central American migrants, and by 2012 had tens of thousands of followers throughout the country, primarily in cities with high Latino populations.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|pp=9–11}} {{as of|2016}}, the religion of Santa Muerte is said to be one of the fastest growing [[new religious movement]]s in the world, with an estimated 10 to 12 million followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/r-andrew-chesnut/mexicos-top-two-santa-mue_b_8253318.html|title=Mexico's Top Two Santa Muerte Leaders Finally Meet|first1=|last1=R.|first2=rew Chesnut Chaired Professor of Religious|last2=Studies|first3=Virginia Commonwealth|last3=University|date=6 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes and iconography==
[[File:Muerte-Blanca 6.jpg|thumb|White Santa Muerte.]]
Our Lady of Holy Death is a [[Death (personification)|personification of death]].{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=6}} Unlike other saints who originated in Mexican folk religion, Santa Muerte is not, herself, seen as a dead human being.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=6}} She is associated with healing, protection, financial wellbeing, and assurance of a path to the afterlife.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=7}}

Although there are other death saints in Latin America, such as [[San La Muerte]], Santa Muerte is the only female saint of death in either of the Americas.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=7}} Iconographically, Santa Muerte is a skeleton dressed in female clothes or a shroud, and carrying both a scythe and a globe.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=6}}&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt; Santa Muerte is marked out as female not by her figure but by her attire and hair. The latter was introduced by a believer named Enriqueta Romero.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=8}}

The two most common objects that Santa Muerte holds in her hands are a globe and a [[scythe]]. The scythe can symbolize the cutting of negative energies or influences. As a harvesting tool, a scythe may also symbolize hope and prosperity.&lt;ref name="oriana1318"/&gt; Her scythe reflects her origins as the Grim Reaper ("la Parca" of medieval Spain),&lt;ref name="Chesnut"/&gt; and can represent the moment of death, when it is said to cut a silver thread. The scythe has a long handle, indicating that it can reach anywhere. The globe represents Death's vast power and dominion over the earth,&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt; and may be seen as a kind of a tomb to which we all return.&lt;ref name="oriana1318"/&gt;

Other objects associated with Santa Muerte include scales, an hourglass, an owl, and an oil lamp.&lt;ref name="oriana1318"/&gt; The scales allude to equity, justice, and impartiality, as well as divine will.&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt; An hourglass indicates the time of life on earth and also the belief that death is not the end, as the hourglass can be inverted to start over.&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt; The hourglass denotes Santa Muerte's relationship with time as well as with the worlds above and below. It also symbolizes patience. An owl symbolizes her ability to navigate the darkness and her wisdom. The owl is also said to act as a messenger.&lt;ref name="Chesnut"/&gt; A lamp symbolizes intelligence and spirit, to light the way through the darkness of ignorance and doubt.&lt;ref name="oriana1318"/&gt; Some followers of Santa Muerte believe that she is jealous and that her image should not be placed next to those of other saints or deities, or there will be consequences.&lt;ref name="MRamirez"/&gt;

===Rites associated with Santa Muerte===
[[File:Mercado de Sonora México DF 20 04 07.jpg|thumb|300px|Figurines of Santa Muerte for sale in Sonora Market, Mexico City.]]
Rites dedicated to Our Lady of Holy Death include processions and prayers with the aim of gaining a favor.&lt;ref name="Villarreal"/&gt; Some believers of Santa Muerte remain members of the Catholic Church,&lt;ref name="oriana0709"/&gt; while millions are cutting ties with the Catholic Church and founding independent Santa Muerte churches and temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/video/possessed-modern-day-exorcisms-part-two|title=The Rise of Santa Muerte Worship and Demon Exorcism in Mexico - VICE - United States|publisher=|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altars of Santa Muerte temples generally contain one or multiple images of the lady, generally surrounded by any or all of the following: cigarettes, flowers, fruit, incense, water, alcoholic beverages, coins, candies and candles.&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Villarreal"/&gt;

According to popular belief, Santa Muerte is very powerful and is reputed to grant many favors. Her images are treated as holy and can give favors in return for the faith of the believer, with miracles playing a vital role. As Señora de la Noche ("Lady of Night"), she is often invoked by those exposed to the dangers of working at night, such as taxi drivers, bar owners, police, soldiers, and prostitutes. As such, devotees believe she can protect against assaults, accidents, gun violence, and all types of violent death.&lt;ref name="oriana1112"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Velazquez |first1=Oriana |title= El libro de la Santa Muerte |trans-title=The book of Santa Muerte |year=2007 |publisher= Editores Mexicanos Unidos, S.A.  |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |isbn=978-968-15-2040-3 |pages=11–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SantissimaM.jpg|thumb|left|Red Santa Muerte.]]

The image is dressed differently depending on what is being requested. Usually, the vestments of the image are differently colored robes, but it is also common for the image to be dressed as a bride (for those seeking a husband)&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt; or in European medieval [[nun]]'s garments similar to female Catholic saints.&lt;ref name="Garma"/&gt; The colors of Our Lady of Holy Death's votive candles and vestments are associated with the type of petitions made.&lt;ref name="cronica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.has.vcu.edu/wrs/profiles/SantaMuerteSpanish.htm |title=World Religions &amp; Spirituality &amp;#124; Cronica De La Santa Muerte |publisher=Has.vcu.edu |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White is the most common color and can symbolize gratitude, purity, or the cleansing of negative influences. Red is for love and passion. It can also signify emotional stability. The color gold signifies economic power, success, money, and prosperity. Green symbolizes justice, legal matters, or unity with loved ones. Amber or dark yellow indicates health. Images with this color can be seen in rehabilitation centers, especially those for drug addiction and alcoholism.&lt;ref name="Chesnut"/&gt; Black represents total protection against black magic or sorcery, or conversely negative magic or for force directed against rivals and enemies. Blue candles and images of the saint indicate wisdom, which is favored by students and those in education. It can also be used to petition for health. Brown is used to invoke spirits from beyond while purple, like yellow, usually symbolizes health.&lt;ref name="cronica"/&gt;

Devotees may present her with a polychrome seven-color candle, which Chesnut believed was probably adopted from the seven powers candle of [[Santería]], a syncretic faith brought to Mexico by Cuban migrants.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|pp=19–20, 26}} Here the seven colors are gold, silver, copper, blue, purple, red, and green.&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oriana1318"/&gt;  In addition to the candles and vestments, each devotee adorns their own image in their own way, using U.S. dollars, gold coins, jewelry, and other items.&lt;ref name="Villarreal"/&gt;

Santa Muerte also has a "[[saint's day]]", which varies from shrine to shrine. The most prominent is November 1, when the believer Enriqueta Romero celebrates her at her historic Tepito shrine where the famous effigy is dressed as a bride.&lt;ref name="oriana0709"/&gt; Others celebrate her day on August 15.&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt;

===Places of worship===
[[File:Dec1Romero18.JPG|thumb|150px|A believer touching the glass of the first public shrine to Santa Muerte, [[Tepito]], Mexico City.]]
According to Chesnut, the religion of Our Lady of Holy Death is "generally informal and unorganized".{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=8}}
Since worship of this image has been, and to a large extent still is, clandestine, most rituals are performed in altars constructed at the homes of devotees.&lt;ref name="Garma"/&gt; Recently shrines to this image have been mushrooming in public. The one on Dr. Vertiz Street in [[Colonia Doctores]] is unique in Mexico City because it features an image of [[Jesús Malverde]] along with Santa Muerte. Another public shrine is in a small park on Matamoros Street very close to [[Paseo de la Reforma]].&lt;ref name="Chesnut"/&gt;

Shrines can also be found in the back of all kinds of stores and gas stations. As veneration of Santa Muerte becomes more accepted, stores specializing in religious articles, such as [[botánica]]s, are carrying more and more paraphernalia related to the religion. Historian R. Andrew Chesnut has discovered that many botanicas in both Mexico and the U.S. are kept in business by sales of Santa Muerte paraphernalia, with numerous shops earning up to half of their profits on Santa Muerte items.&lt;ref name="Chesnut"/&gt; This is true even of stores in very well known locations such as Pasaje Catedral behind the [[Mexico City Cathedral]], which is mostly dedicated to store selling Catholic liturgical items. Her image is a staple in esoterica shops.&lt;ref name="Villarreal"/&gt;

There are those who now call themselves Santa Muerte priests or priestesses, such as Jackeline Rodríguez in [[Monterrey]]. She maintains a shop in Mercado Juárez in Monterrey, where [[tarot reading|tarot readers]], [[curandero]]s, herbal healers and sorcerers can also be found.&lt;ref name="porvenir"&gt;{{cite news |title= Vende bien aquí la Santa Muerte |first= Ricardo |last=Harden Cooper |url=http://www.elporvenir.com.mx/notas.asp?nota_id=193834 |newspaper=El Porvenir |location=Mexico City |date=2008-02-14 |accessdate=2009-10-07 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Santa Muerte sells well here }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shrine of the Most Holy Death====
[[File:Dec1Romero11.JPG|thumb|300px|The raising of Santa Muerte images during a service for Santa Muerte in [[Tepito]], Mexico City.]]
The establishment of the first public shrine to the image began to change how Santa Muerte was venerated. The veneration has grown rapidly since then, and others have put their images on public display, as well.&lt;ref name="Garma"/&gt;

In 2001, Enriqueta Romero decided to take a life-sized statue of Santa Muerte in her home in Mexico City and build a shrine for it, visible from the street. The shrine does not hold Catholic masses or occult rites, but people come here to pray and to leave offerings to the image.&lt;ref name="oriana0709"/&gt; The effigy is dressed in garbs of different colors depending on the season, with the Romero family changing the dress every first Monday of the month. This statue of the saint features large quantities of jewelry on her neck and arms, which are pinned to her clothing. It is surrounded by offerings left to it, including: flowers, fruits (especially apples), candles, toys, money, notes of thanks for prayers granted, cigarettes, and alcoholic beverages that surround it.&lt;ref name="oriana0709"/&gt;

Enriqueta Romero considers herself the chaplain of the shrine, a role she says she inherited from her aunt, who began the practice in the family in 1962.&lt;ref name="oriana0709"/&gt;  The shrine is located on 12 Alfarería Street in [[Tepito]], [[Colonia Morelos]]. For many, this Santa Muerte is the [[patron saint]] of Tepito.&lt;ref name="trece"/&gt; The house also contains a shop that sells amulets, bracelets, medallions, books, images, and other items; the most popular item sold there is votive candles.&lt;ref name="Villarreal"/&gt;

On the first day of every month Enriqueta Romero or one of her sons lead prayers and the saying of the Santa Muerte [[rosary]], which lasts for about an hour and is based on the Catholic rosary.&lt;ref name="Villarreal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chesnut"/&gt; On the first of November the anniversary of the altar to Santa Muerte constructed by Enriqueta Romero is celebrated. This Santa Muerte is dressed as a bride and wears hundreds of pieces of gold jewelry given by the faithful to show gratitude for favors received, or to ask for one.&lt;ref name="trece"/&gt;

The celebration officially begins at the stroke of midnight of November 1. About 5,000 faithful turn out to pray the rosary. For purification, the smoke of [[marijuana]] is used rather than [[incense]], which is traditionally used for purification by Catholics. Food such as cake, chicken with [[mole (sauce)|mole]], hot chocolate, coffee, and [[atole]] are served during the celebrations, which features performances by [[mariachi]]s and [[marimba]] bands.&lt;ref name="trece"/&gt;

==Sociology of the religion==
[[File:MuerteAztecTepito.JPG|thumb|250px|Santa Muerte dressed in [[Aztec]]an style]]

The religion of Santa Muerte is present throughout the strata of Mexican society, although the majority of devotees are from the urban working class.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|pp=11–12}} Most are young people, aged in their teens, twenties, or thirties, and are also mostly female.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=13}}
A large following developed among Mexicans who are disillusioned with the dominant, institutional Catholic Church and, in particular, with the inability of established Catholic saints to deliver them from poverty.&lt;ref name="gray"/&gt;

The phenomenon is based among people with scarce resources, excluded from the formal market economy, as well as the judicial and educational systems, primarily in the inner cities and the very rural areas.&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt; Devotion to Santa Muerte is what anthropologists call a "cult of crisis". Devotion to the image peaks during economic and social hardships, which tend to affect the working classes more.  Santa Muerte tends to attract those in extremely difficult or hopeless situations but also appeals to smaller sectors of middle class professionals and even the affluent.&lt;ref name="Garma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cronica"/&gt; Some of her most devoted followers are those who commit petty economic crimes, often committed out of desperation, such as prostitutes, and petty thieves.&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt;

The worship of Santa Muerte also attracts those who are not inclined to seek the traditional Catholic Church for spiritual solace, as it is part of the "legitimate" sector of society. Many followers of Santa Muerte live on the margins of the law or outside it entirely. Many street vendors, taxi drivers, vendors of [[copyright infringement|counterfeit merchandise]], street people, [[Prostitution|prostitutes]], [[Pickpocketing|pickpockets]], petty [[drug trafficking|drug traffickers]] and [[gang]] members who are part of the religion are not practicing Catholics or Protestants, but neither are they [[Atheism|atheists]].&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt;

In essence they have created their own new religion that reflects their realities, identity, and practices, especially since it speaks to the violence and struggles for life that many of these people face.&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt; Conversely both police and military in Mexico can be counted among the faithful who ask for blessings on their weapons and ammunition.&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt;

While worship is largely based in poor neighborhoods, Santa Muerte is also venerated in affluent areas such as Mexico City's [[Condesa]] and [[Coyoacán]] districts.&lt;ref name="Pacheco"/&gt; However, negative media coverage of the worship and condemnation by the Catholic Church in Mexico and certain Protestant denominations have influenced public perception of the religion of Santa Muerte. With the exception of some artists and politicians, some of whom perform rituals secretly, those in higher socioeconomic strata look upon the veneration with distaste as a form of [[superstition]].&lt;ref name="Garma"/&gt;

===Association with the LGBT community===
Santa Muerte is also seen as a protector of [[LGBT in Mexico|homosexual, bisexual, and transgender communities in Mexico]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outinthebay.com/archives.htm |title=Archives |date=2012 |website=outinthebay.com |publisher=Out In The Bay |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424085030/http://www.outinthebay.com/archives.htm |archive-date=2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; since many are considered to be outcast from society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastwordonnothing.com/2012/04/11/a-catholic-saint-and-an-aztec-god/ |title=Redux: A Catholic Saint and an Aztec God |publisher=The Last Word On Nothing |date=2012-04-11 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many LGBT people ask her for protection from violence, hatred, disease, and to help them in their search for love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=16642 |title=Santa Muerte is no saint, say Mexican bishops |publisher=Speroforum.com |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Comments Leave a Comment Categories Santa Muerte |url=http://bonemojo.wordpress.com/category/santa-muerte/ |title=Santa Muerte « bonemojo |publisher=Bonemojo.wordpress.com |date=2011-05-19 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Association with criminality===

In the Mexican and U.S. press, the Santa Muerte religion is often associated with violence, criminality, and the illegal drug trade.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|pp=10, 14}} She is a popular deity in prisons, both among inmates and staff, and shrines dedicated to her can be found in many cells.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|pp=14–15}}&lt;ref name="Pacheco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCU"&gt;Chesnut, R. Andrew; Borealis, Sarah (2012-02-20). Santa Muerte - Cronica de la Santa Muerte - Santa Muerte Timeline. World Religions &amp; Spirituality Project VCU, Virginia Commonwealth University, 20 January 2012. Retrieved from http://www.has.vcu.edu/wrs/profiles/SantaMuerte.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Altars with images of Santa Muerte have been found in many drug houses in both Mexico and the United States.&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt;  Among Santa Muerte's more famous devotees are kidnapper [[Daniel Arizmendi López]], known as ''El Mochaorejas'', and Gilberto García Mena, one of the bosses of the [[Gulf Cartel]].&lt;ref name="Pacheco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VCU"/&gt; In March 2012, the [[Sonora, Mexico|Sonora]] State Investigative Police announced that they had arrested eight people for [[murder]] for allegedly having performed a [[human sacrifice]] of a woman and two ten-year-old boys to Santa Muerte (see: [[Silvia Meraz]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-03-30/americas/world_americas_mexico-human-sacrifice_1_santa-muerte-human-sacrifices-saint?_s=PM:AMERICAS |title=Officials: 3 killed as human sacrifices in Mexico |author=CNN Wire Staff |date=2012-03-30 |work=CNN.com |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2012-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402221717/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-03-30/americas/world_americas_mexico-human-sacrifice_1_santa-muerte-human-sacrifices-saint?_s=PM:AMERICAS |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, the self-proclaimed bishop David Romo was arrested on charges of banking funds of a kidnapping gang linked to a [[cartel]]. He continues to lead his sect from his prison, but it is unfeasible for Romo or anyone else to gain dominance over the Santa Muerte religion. Her faith is spreading rapidly and "organically" from town to town,  so that is easy to become a preacher or messianic figure. Drug lords, like that of La Familia Cartel, take advantage of "gangster foot soldiers'" vulnerability and enforced religious obedience to establish a holy meaning to their cause that would keep their soldiers disciplined.&lt;ref name=Grillo&gt;{{cite book|last=Grillo|first=Ioan|title=El Narco|year=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Votive candles==

[[File:Santa Muerte Votives.jpg|thumb|Santa Muerte votive candles at a grocery store in suburban [[Washington, D.C.]].]] 
Santa Muerte is a multifaceted saint, with various symbolic meanings and her devotees can call upon her a wide range of reasons. In herbal shops and markets one can find a plethora of Santa Muerte [[paraphernalia]] like the [[votive candles]] that have her image on the front and in a color representative of its purpose. On the back of the candles are prayers associated with the color's meaning and may sometimes come with additional prayer cards.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=John|title=Santísma Muerte: Origin and Development of a Mexican Occult Image|journal=Journal of the Southwest|date=Winter 1998|volume=40|issue=4|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The candles are placed on altars and devotees turn to specific colored candles depending on their circumstance. Some keep the full range of colored candles while others focus on one aspect of Santa Muerte's spirit. Santa Muerte's image as satanic or evil has been derived from her association with drug trafficking and the dead bodies found at her altar, however, the specific colors for the candles indicate that Santa Muerte's devotees stem from many walks of life beyond crime, violence, and the drug trade. Santa Muerte is called upon for matters of the heart, health, money, wisdom, and justice. There is the brown candle of wisdom, the white candle of gratitude and [[consecration]], the black candle for protection and vengeance, the red candle of love and passion, the gold candle for monetary affairs, the green candle for crime and justice, the purple candle for healing.&lt;ref name="Chesnut, 3-27"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chesnut|first=R. Andrew|title=Devoted to Death: Santa Muerte, the Skeleton Saint|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|pages=3–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The black votive candle is lit for prayer in order to implore La Flaca's protection and vengeance. It is the lowest selling candle due to its association with "black magic" and witchcraft. It is not regularly seen at [[Place of worship|devotional sites]], and is usually kept and lit in the privacy of one's home. To avert from calling upon official Catholic saints for illegal purpose, drug trafficker will light Santa Muerte's black candle to ensure protection of shipment of drugs across the border.&lt;ref name="Chesnut, 3-27" /&gt;

Black candles are presented to Santa Muerte's altars that drug traffickers used to ensure protection from violence of rival gangs as well as ensure harm to their enemies in gangs and law enforcement. As the [[drug war in Mexico]] escalates, Santa Muerte's veneration by drug bosses increases and her image is seen again and again in various [[Crack house|drug houses]]. Ironically, the military and police officers that are employed to dismantle the White Lady's shrines make up a large portion of her devotees. Furthermore, even though her presence in the drug world is becoming routine, the sale of black candles pales in comparison to top selling white, red, and gold candles.&lt;ref name="chesnut, 102,103"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chesnut|first=Andrew|title=Devoted to Death: Santa Muerte, the Skeleton Saint|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=102, 103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Santa Muerte's more popular uses is in matters of the heart. The red candle that symbolizes love is helpful in various situations having to do with love. Her initial main purpose was in that of love magic during the [[Mexico#Colonial period .281519.E2.80.931821.29|colonial era in Mexico]], which may have been derived from the love magic being brought over from Europe. Her origins are still unclear but it is possible that the image of the European [[Grim Reaper]] combined with the [[Ethnic religion|indigenous]] celebrations of death are at the root of La Flaca's existence, in so that the use of love magic in Europe and that of pre-Columbian times that was also merging during colonization may have established the saint as manipulator of love.&lt;ref name="Thompson, John"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=John|title=Santísma Muerte: Origin and Development of a Mexican Occult Image|journal=Journal of the Southwest|date=Winter 1998|volume=40|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of anthropological writing on Santa Muerte discuss her significance as provider of love magic and miracles.&lt;ref name=Chesnut /&gt;  The candle can be lit for Santa Muerte to attract a certain lover and ensure their love. In contrast though, the red candle can be prayed to for help in ending a bad relationship in order to start another one. These love miracles require specific rituals to increase their love doctors power. The rituals require several ingredients including red roses and [[rose water]] for passion, binding stick to unite the lovers, [[cinnamon]] for prosperity, and several others depending on the specific ritual.&lt;ref name=Chesnut /&gt;

==Santa Muerte and the Catholic Church==
[[File:Mexican folklore on LA Broadway.jpg|thumb|300px|Santa Muerte statues alongside other items of Mexican veneration ([[Jesus]], [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Marian]]) on sale at a shop on Broadway in downtown Los Angeles.]]

The [[Catholic Church|Vatican]] has condemned the "cult" of Santa Muerte in Mexico as [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] and [[Theistic Satanism|satanic]],&lt;ref name="MRamirez"/&gt; calling it a "degeneration of religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-22462181 |title=BBC News - Vatican declares Mexican Death Saint blasphemous |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-05-09 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin American [[Protestantism|Protestant churches]] have condemned it too, as [[black magic]] and trickery.&lt;ref name="Garma"/&gt; [[Roman Catholicism in Mexico|Mexico's Catholic Church]] has accused Santa Muerte devotees—many of whom were baptized in the Catholic religion despite the difference of belief and the fact that Santa Muerte churches and temples have instituted a separate baptism practice—of having turned to devil-worship.&lt;ref name="gray"/&gt;

Catholics say that Santa Muerte is an [[idolatry|idol]], the worship of which has been rejected by Yahweh in the [[Old Testament]]. Veneration of this or any other idol can be a form of inadvertent devil-worship, because regardless of the intent of the worshipers, the devil can trick people into doing such things. Priests regularly chastise parishioners, telling them that death is not a person but rather a phase of life.&lt;ref name="Garma"/&gt; However, the Church stops short of labeling such followers as [[heretics]], instead accusing them of [[heterodoxy]].&lt;ref name="DGarcia"&gt;{{cite news |title= La "Niña blanca" mejor conocida como La Santa Muerte |first=Daniel |last=Garcia Meza |url=http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/390200.la-nina-blanca-mejor-conocida-como-la-santa-m.html |newspaper=El Siglo de Torreon |location=Torreon, Mexico |date=2008-11-01 |accessdate=2009-10-07 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The White Girl, better known as Santa Muerte }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reasons the Mexican Catholic Church has officially condemned the worship of Santa Muerte is that most of her rites are modeled after [[Catholic liturgy]],&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt; and some Santa Muerte devotees eventually split from the Catholic Church and began vying for control of church buildings.&lt;ref name="gray"/&gt;

==Santa Muerte in the United States==
[[File:Santa muerte altar.jpeg|thumb|300px|A Santa Muerte garden altar in [[Richmond, California|Richmond]] in California's San Francisco Bay Area.]]
The Santa Muerte religion was established in the United States circa 2005, brought to the country by Mexican and Central American migrants.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=13}} Chesnut suggests that there were tens of thousands of devotees in the U.S. by 2012.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012|p=11}} This religion is primarily visible in cities with high populations, such as [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Houston]], [[San Antonio]], [[Tucson]], and [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref name="MRamirez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gray"/&gt; although it has also been located in cities with small Latino communities like Richmond, Virginia.{{sfn|Chesnut|2012}} There are fifteen religious groups dedicated to her in Los Angeles alone,&lt;ref name="peña"/&gt; which include the Temple of Santa Muerte.&lt;ref name="templo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Templo a la Santa Muerte |url=http://templosantamuerte.com/miscelaneos.html  |accessdate=2009-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522225749/http://templosantamuerte.com/miscelaneos.html |archive-date=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some places, such as Northern California and New Orleans, her popularity has spread beyond the Latino community. For instance, the Santisima Muerte Chapel of Perpetual Pilgrimage is maintained by a woman of Danish descent, while the New Orleans Chapel of the Santisima Muerte was founded in 2012 by a European-American devotee.&lt;ref name="muertechapel"&gt;{{cite web |title=Santisima Muerte Chapel of Perpetual Pilgrimage|url=http://santisimamuertechapel.org  |accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NOLA shrine"&gt;{{cite web |title=The New Orleans Chapel of the Santisima Muerte|url=http://santisimamuerteneworleans.org  |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in Mexico, some elements of the Catholic Church in the United States are trying to combat Santa Muerte worship, in [[Chicago]] particularly.&lt;ref name="MRamirez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gray"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MMartin"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.osv.com/tabid/7621/itemid/9029/Our-Lady-of-Guadalupe-battles-Holy-Death-for-dev.aspx |title = Our Lady of Guadalupe battles 'Holy Death' for devotion of Mexican faithful |author = Martin, Michelle |publisher = Our Sunday Visitor |date = 2012-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217082358/http://www.osv.com/tabid/7621/itemid/9029/Our-Lady-of-Guadalupe-battles-Holy-Death-for-dev.aspx |archive-date=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LALorentzen"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sightings/holy-death-usmexico-border-lois-ann-lorentzen |title = Holy Death on the US/Mexico Border |author = Lorentzen, Lois Ann |publisher = The University of Chicago Divinity School |date = 2009-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the Catholic Church in Mexico, the official reaction in the U.S. is mostly either nonexistent or muted. The [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]] has not issued an official position on this relatively new phenomenon in the country.&lt;ref name="gray"/&gt; Opposition to the veneration of Santa Muerte took an unprecedented violent turn in late January, 2013, when vandal(s) smashed a controversial statue of the folk saint, which had appeared in the San Benito, Texas, municipal cemetery at the beginning of the month.&lt;ref name="MRodriguez"&gt;Rodriguez, Michael; Jimenez, Francisco E.

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2008}}

A '''seat filler''' is a person who fills in an empty seat during an event. There are two types of seat fillers:

# a person who subscribes to a seat-filling theatre club. Members of these clubs help fill in unsold seats for theatre, music, film, sporting events, dance performances and other live events. The producers of the event give complimentary tickets to the seat-filling organization, who pass them on to their members. The producers get a fuller [[audience]] and therefore a better experience for the paying patrons (and talent), while the seat-filler is able to see an event for a small service charge. Within the industry, this is also referred to as "papering the house". &lt;br /&gt;Some seat-filling companies charge no surcharge per ticket and only a membership based fee. This model is popular in cities with a larger number of shows and therefore a higher number of tickets to go around.
# a person who takes up spare seats when the person allocated the seat is elsewhere. An example of this is the [[Academy Awards]] in which many of the audience are either gaining awards, once they win the award the recipient needs to wait for an appropriate time to return to their seat, or because the member of the audience is involved in producing the show. Seat fillers are primarily employed so that when TV cameras show audience shots there are no empty seats.

==Benefits to the Shows==
* Increased awareness of their show (especially helpful if new)
* Higher concession sales 
* Fuller audience for a better show experience
* Marketing to a vocal audience
* Private and no cost. Most seat filler services offer their service for free to the shows with an attached promise that their members will not publicly state where they received the tickets from as to not impact future sales

==In popular culture==
*In the ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' episode "My Doctor Has a Cow Puppet", Charlie tries to set up Alan with one of his friends who works as a seat filler at award ceremonies.
*In the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Summer of George]]", [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] works as a seat filler at the [[Tony Awards]].
*The plot of the 2004 movie ''[[The Seat Filler]]'' revolves around a seat-filler who meets a burgeoning pop star during an event.
*In the movie ''[[Now You See Me (film)|Now You See Me]]'', they mention that the audience are a bunch of seat fillers.
*In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Call Girl (Family Guy)|Call Girl]]", [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] works as a seat filler for fetuses during [[ultrasounds]].
*In the [[87th Academy Awards]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]] mentions the seat fillers explaining its meaning and jokes with [[Steve Carell]] as if he were a seat filler.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9931">'''Inequity''' is injustice or unfairness or an instance of either of the two.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster Online. [http://m-w.com/dictionary/inequity "Inequity."] Retrieved 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Aversion''' is "a feeling of repugnance toward something with a desire to avoid or turn from it; a settled dislike; a tendency to extinguish a behavior or to avoid a thing or situation and especially a usually pleasurable one because it is or has been associated with a noxious stimulus".&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster Online. [http://m-w.com/dictionary/aversion "Aversion."] Retrieved 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The given definition of [[inequity aversion]] is "the preference for fairness and resistance to inequitable outcomes".

==Clarification through experiment==
{{See also|Inequity aversion in animals}}
To better understand and breakdown the concept of social inequity aversion would be to use the study done by [[Sarah Brosnan]] (as well as with Frans B. M. de Waal),&lt;ref name=Henrich&gt;[[Joseph Henrich|Henrich, Joseph]].[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v428/n6979/full/428139a.html#B1 "Animal Behaviour (Communication Arising): Inequity Aversion in Capuchins?"] 11 March 2004. ''Nature''. Issue 428. Retrieved 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; who specializes in social behavior and social cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Brosnan, Sarah. [http://www.physiology.emory.edu/FIRST/sarah.htm "Sarah Brosnan, Ph.D."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205204734/http://www.physiology.emory.edu/FIRST/sarah.htm |date=2005-02-05 }} Fellowships in Research and Science Teaching. Emory University School of Medicine. Department of Physiology. Retrieved 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiment, "Monkeys Reject Unequal Pay" five female [[capuchin monkey]]s were used and given an unequal distribution of rewards by the human experimenter. The female monkeys alternated in pairs under four different conditions with the experimenter. Of the female monkeys, two received the same reward, one female received a superior reward, one female received a superior reward without exchange (for example without work), and a single female observed a superior reward in the absence of a partner.&lt;ref name=Mardle&gt;Mardle, Earl. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220022206/http://www.kn.com.au/networks/2003/09/inequity_aversi.html "Inequity Aversion – Even a Monkey Can Pick a Raw Deal"]. A Networked World. Retrieved 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The females were much less likely to complete a trade with the human experimenter when their corresponding partner received a food item of higher value item (a grape; the lower item was a cucumber&lt;ref name=Henrich /&gt;), and when that partner received the higher food item with no exchange of work of any kind, the likelihood of not completing a trade intensified.&lt;ref name=Mardle /&gt; All of these refusals of exchange included both passive and active rejections ranging from refusing to take the awards to throwing the reward, respectively. These negative responses of situation made with the monkeys support the early evolutionary origin of [[inequity aversion]]&lt;ref name=Mardle /&gt; and thus helps (in combination with the definitions of inequity and aversion) give an overall idea of what social inequity aversion is: the tendency to reject or avoid situations in which there is [[social inequality]], unfairness, or injustice.

==In humans==
It is important to note that the experiment was done with capuchin monkeys and not humans, and because humans are not the only cooperative animals (monkeys being one of many examples), we cannot assume that inequity aversion is an exclusive human trait or nature.&lt;ref&gt;Brosnan, Sarah and de Waal, Frans B. M. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6955/abs/nature01963.html#a1 "Monkeys Reject Unequal Pay"]. 23 July 2003. ''Nature''. Issue 428. Retrieved 3 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been other experiments done with humans to test the validity of the inequity aversion theory proposed by Brosnan and de Waal. An experiment performed by Urs Fischbacher, Christina M. Fong, and Ernst Fehr called "Fairness, Errors, and the Power of Competition"&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Ernst. Fischbacher, Urs. Fong, Christina M. [http://www.iew.unizh.ch/wp/iewwp133.pdf "Fairness, Errors, and the Power of Competition"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630134015/http://www.iew.unizh.ch/wp/iewwp133.pdf |date=2007-06-30 }}. Institute for Empirical Research in Economics. University of Zurich. December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; consisted of a multi-lateral ultimatum game where one contestant was put up against multiple ones.&lt;ref name=Henrich /&gt; In this experiment when the responders accepts the offer from the person giving the reward (say the 'provider'), the person giving the reward (the provider) gets his full pay. The key to this experiment is that the ability of one responder to affect the pay of the provider is lessened by all of the other responders' willingness to accept the reward. As a result, the concept of inequity aversion is followed, which says that the responders' willingness to reject the reward is lessened as well as the providers' offers.&lt;ref name=Henrich /&gt; (This is because in order to evade inequality or injustice due to unequal pay, all of the participants reduce their amounts to reduce the chance of unfairness). What's most important to realize in this experiment is that the outcome does not seem to agree with those of Brosnan and de Waal's capuchin experiment; humans will not reject the offer unless it affects others reward and/or pay.&lt;ref name=Henrich /&gt; So for humans, the original Fehr-Schmidt inequity aversion model, which was cited by Brosnan and de Waal in their capuchin experiment saying that the capuchin monkeys should always eat the lower value food, seems to hold validity. By not rejecting the reward offered, the humans decreased the amount of inequality. This was the opposite for the capuchins as they rejected the lower value food (cucumbers) when they couldn't get the higher value food (grapes) thus increasing the inequality, especially when the capuchins who received the grapes stole the discarded cucumbers, leaving the other monkeys with nothing. That increased the amount of inequality among the capuchins—The humans would only reject the reward if it reduced the reward of the individual who received the most.&lt;ref name=Henrich /&gt;

==Combining with social inequality==
According to Sarah Brosnan, "human beings have a similar approach, we do not live in a world of absolute values but one in which we are constantly comparing ourselves with those about us and, like a capuchin, we can tell when we are being short changed".&lt;ref name=Mardle /&gt; This can directly be connected to social inequality in that we as humans know what social inequality is and can identify it as an injustice; it is how we know that something such as unequal pay based on socioeconomic status is social inequality. However, according to the concept of social inequity aversion, we will not reject what is offered to us unless we realize that by rejecting what we are offered we will reduce another person's earnings or the earnings of the person who is giving to us, thus making our earnings closer to theirs, thus lessening the inequality.

One key example that links these two concepts could be that of the Neoclassical labor-market theory. Based on several important facts, this theory is based on the supposition that "(1) a relatively free and open market exists in which individuals compete for position. (2) Position in that markets depends heavily on the individual's efforts, abilities, experience, training, or '[[human capital]].' (3) There are automatic mechanisms that operate in the marketplace to ensure that imbalances between one's input (human capital) and one's rewards (wages) are corrected in a way to restore balance" (Hurst 231).&lt;ref name=Hurst&gt;Hurst, Charles E. ''Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequence''. 6th Ed. Pearson Education, Inc. USA. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is interesting in that the third fact that is assumed to be true in a labor-market theory would apply greatly to the concept of social inequity aversion. This is because it would seem that in order to get the reward that is expected we as people will take what is given to us for our skill. But when it becomes possible that our fellow citizen can get more than us, or that the company that is providing us with the reward (payments) gets more money from our labor/skill, then we as people in this labor market theory will reject the payments, and try to obtain a better one. We do this by trying to attain better resources for ourselves, such as "education, training, skills, and intelligence" (Hurst 231).&lt;ref name=Hurst /&gt; So take for example an African American woman, she will take the payment that all African American women are receiving. But once another African American woman begins to get better payment: via her better resources, other African American women will reject their current position as well as resources and seek more to in order to, maybe not directly lessen the payment that other African American woman, but to get more for themselves. This greatly illustrates the social inequity aversion concept when it comes to humans and how it crosses with the neoclassical labor market theory. However, because it is a continuous process in which different opportunities open up doors for individuals based on their life changes and access to better resources, an imbalance is made and a gap develops, thus separating individuals and creating ongoing social inequality (Hurst 231).&lt;ref name=Hurst /&gt;

[[Image:Tizian 094.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Tarquin attacking nude Lucretia with a dagger|''[[Tarquin and Lucretia (1571 painting)|Tarquin and Lucretia]]'' by [[Titian]]]]
'''''The Rape of Lucrece''''' (1594) is a [[narrative poem]] by [[William Shakespeare]] about the legendary [[Lucretia]]. In his previous narrative poem, ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' (1593), Shakespeare had included a dedicatory letter to his patron, the [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton|Earl of Southampton]], in which he promised to compose a "graver labour". Accordingly, ''The Rape of Lucrece'' has a serious tone throughout.

The poem begins with a prose dedication addressed directly to the [[Earl of Southampton]], which begins, "The love I dedicate to your Lordship is without end."  It refers to the poem as a [[pamphlet]], which describes the form of its original publication of 1594.

The dedication is followed by "The Argument", a prose paragraph that summarizes the events preceding the start of the poem, which begins ''[[in media res]]''.

The poem contains 1,855 lines, divided into 265 stanzas of seven lines each. The meter of each line is [[iambic pentameter]].  The rhyme scheme for each stanza is ABABBCC, a format known as "[[rhyme royal]]", which has been used by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[John Milton]] and [[John Masefield]].&lt;ref name="Duncan-Jones and Woodhuysen"&gt;Duncan-Jones, Katherine, and H. R. Woudhuysen (eds). Shakespeare, William. ''Shakespeare's Poems: Third Series''. Arden Shakespeare (28 September 2007) {{ISBN|978-1903436875}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
The poem is set just before the establishment of the [[Roman Republic]] in 509 BC. The poem's locations are Rome, [[Ardea, Lazio|Ardea]], twenty-four miles south of Rome, and Collatium, ten miles east of Rome.

==Synopsis==
One evening, at the town of Ardea, where a battle is being fought, two leading Roman soldiers, Tarquin and Collatine, are talking. Collatine describes his wife, Lucrece, in glowing terms—she is beautiful and chaste. The following morning, Tarquin travels to Collatine's home. Lucrece welcomes him. Tarquin entertains her with stories of her husband's deeds on the battlefield.

Tarquin spends the night, and is torn by his desire for Lucrece. His desire overcomes him, and he goes to Lucrece's chamber, where she is asleep. He reaches out and touches her breast, which wakes her up. She is afraid.  He tells her that she must give in to him, or else he will kill her. He also threatens to cause her dishonor by murdering a slave and placing the two bodies in each other's arms, and then he would claim that he killed her because he discovered them in this embrace. If she would give in to him, Tarquin promises to keep it all secret.  Lucrece pleads with him to no avail. He rapes her.

Full of shame and guilt, Tarquin sneaks away. Lucrece is devastated, furious and suicidal. She writes a letter to her husband, asking him to come home. When Collatine gets home, Lucrece tells him the whole story, but doesn't say who did it. Collatine demands to know.  Before she tells him, Lucrece gets the soldiers, who are also there, to promise to avenge this crime. She then tells her husband who did it, and she immediately pulls out a knife, stabs herself and dies.  Collatine's grief is great—he wants to kill himself, as well.  His friend, Brutus, suggests that revenge is a better choice. The soldiers carry Lucrece's body through the streets of Rome.  The citizens, angered, banish Tarquin and his family.

==Publication and title==
[[File:Lucrece 1616.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Title page of the narrative poem The Rape of Lucrece with Mr. prefixing Shakespeare's name.|Title page of the sixth edition of ''The Rape of Lucrece'' (1616).]]
''The Rape of Lucrece'' was entered into the [[Stationers' Register]] on 9 May 1594, and published later that year, in a [[book size|quarto]] printed by [[Richard Field (printer)|Richard Field]] for the bookseller John Harrison ("the Elder"); Harrison sold the book from his shop at the sign of the White Greyhound in [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's]] Churchyard. The title given on the title page was simply ''Lucrece'', though the running title throughout the volume, as well as the heading at the beginning of the text is ''The Rape of Lucrece''.&lt;ref name="Duncan-Jones and Woodhuysen" /&gt; Harrison's copyright was transferred to Roger Jackson in 1614; Jackson issued a sixth edition (O5) in 1616. Other octavo editions followed in 1624, 1632 and 1655.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem went through eight editions before 1641.

==Historical background==
''The Rape of Lucrece'' draws on the story described in both [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' and [[Livy]]'s [[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|history of Rome]]. Both authors were writing a few centuries after the events occurred, and their histories are not accepted as strictly accurate, partly because Roman records were [[Sack of Rome (387 BC)|destroyed by the Gauls in 390 B.C.]], and the histories prior to that have been mixed with legends.

The Roman king was  [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|Lucius Tarquinus]], or Tarquin.  Because of his arrogance and his tyranny, he is also known as ''Tarquinius Superbus'' (Tarquin the Proud).  His son, Sextus Tarquinius, heir to the throne, is the rapist of the story. At the beginning of the poem the Roman army is waging war on a tribe known as the Volscians, who had claimed territory south of Rome.  The Romans are laying siege to Ardea, a Volscian city 20 miles south of Rome.

In 509 BC, [[Sextus Tarquinius]], son of the king of Rome, raped [[Lucretia]] (Lucrece), wife of [[Collatinus]], one of the king's aristocratic retainers. As a result, Lucrece committed suicide. Her body was paraded in the Roman Forum by the king's nephew. This incited a full-scale revolt against the Tarquins led by [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], the banishment of the royal family, and the founding of the [[Roman Republic]].

==Allusions to Lucretia in other works by Shakespeare==

===''Cymbeline''===
Shakespeare retains the essence of the classic story, incorporating [[Livy]]'s account that Tarquin's lust for Lucrece sprang from her husband's own praise of her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Titus Livius]]. ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita (History of Rome)]]'', Book I. 49–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare later used the same idea in the late romance ''[[Cymbeline]]'' (circa 1609–1610). In this play, Iachimo bets Posthumus (Imogen's husband) that he can make Imogen commit adultery with him. He does not succeed. However, Iachimo convinces Posthumus otherwise using information about Imogen's bedchamber and body. Iachimo hid in a trunk which was delivered to Imogen's chamber under the pretence of safekeeping some jewels, a gift for her father, King Cymbeline. The scene in which he emerges from the trunk (2.2) mimics the scene in ''The Rape of Lucrece.'' Indeed, Iachimo compares himself to Tarquin in the scene: "Our Tarquin thus, / Did softly press the rushes ere he waken'd / The chastity he wounded" (2.2.12–14).

===''Titus Andronicus''===
''The Rape of Lucrece'' is also closely related to the early Roman tragedy ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' (circa 1590–94). In this [[revenge play]], when the raped and mutilated Lavinia reveals the identity of her rapists, her uncle Marcus invokes the story of Lucrece to urge an oath to revenge the crime: "And swear with me—as, with the woeful fere / And father of that chaste dishonoured dame, / Lord Junius Brutus swore for Lucrece' rape— / That we will prosecute by good advice / Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths, / And see their blood, or die with this reproach" (4.1.89–94).

===''Macbeth''===
The rapist Tarquin is also mentioned in Macbeth's soliloquy from Act 2 Scene 1 of ''[[Macbeth]]'': "wither'd Murther ... With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design / Moves like a ghost" (2.1.52–56). Tarquin's actions and cunning are compared with Macbeth's indecision—both rape and regicide are unforgivable crimes.

===''The Taming of the Shrew''===
In ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' Act 2, Scene 1, Petruchio promises Baptista, the father of Katherine (the Shrew), that once he marries Katherine "for patience she will prove second [[Griselda (folklore)|Grisel]], / And Roman Lucrece for her chastity" (2.1.292–3). 

===''Twelfth Night''===
In ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', Maria's letter in Olivia's handwriting designed to gull Malvolio reads: "I may command where I adore; but silence, like a Lucrece knife, With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore: M, O, A, I, doth sway my life." As Malvolio interprets the "fustian riddle", Olivia's inability or unwillingness to speak of her love for him is killing her, like the literal knife of Lucretia's suicide. Malvolio also notes that Olivia uses an image of Lucrece as a personal [[seal (emblem)|seal]], and it is this that convinces him the letter is from Olivia

== Analysis and criticism ==
''The Rape of Lucrece'', one of Shakespeare's earliest works, was published one year after ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]''. It is seen as a tragic narrative poem, that is extremely rich in poetic images, fancies, and metaphors. It tells a moralistic tale of a bad deed, what caused it, how it occurred, and the tragic result.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, F. T. ed. Shakespeare. ''The Poems.'' Arden Shakespeare (1960) {{ISBN|0416476104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] analysis of the poem, Joel Fineman argues that ''The Rape of Lucrece'', like [[Shakespeare's sonnets]], deconstructs the traditional poetics of praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fineman |first=Joel |chapter=Shakespeare's Will: The Temporality of Rape |title=The Subjectivity Effect in Western Literary Tradition: Essays Toward the Release of Shakespeare's Will |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=1991 |pages=170–171 |isbn=0-262-06136-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fineman observes that the tragic events of the poem are set in motion precisely by Collatine's hyperbolic praise of Lucrece; it is his "boast of Lucrece' sov'reignty" (29) that kindles Tarquin's profane desire.&lt;ref&gt;Fineman 172.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the fact of Lucrece's chastity, but rather the fact that her husband praises her with the "name of 'chaste'" that inspires Tarquin's crime: "Haply, that name of 'chaste' unhapp'ly set / This bateless edge on his keen appetite" (8–9). Collatine's praise paradoxically creates the circumstances that will ruin both the woman that he praises and the integrity of the rhetoric of praise itself.&lt;ref&gt;Fineman 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the poem itself draws attention to its own complicity in Collatine's fatal rhetoric of praise: "the poem itself performs or activates this same praising word of which it speaks."&lt;ref&gt;Fineman 173.&lt;/ref&gt; by citing, in the first line of the second stanza, its own use of "chaste" in the last line of the first stanza: "Collatine's fair love, Lucrece the chaste" (7). To Fineman, the poem's initial self-citation is just one example of how the "poem's own rhetoricity is... performatively implicated in the rape it reports".&lt;ref&gt;Fineman 178.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the opening of the poem highlights an intrinsic link between the language of poetic praise and sexual violence. In these same opening stanzas, ''The Rape of Lucrece'' also acknowledges how its own poetic rhetoric is part of this larger literary tradition which yokes praise and violence.

Jane Newman's feminist analysis of the poem focuses on its relationship to the myth of [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomel]] and [[Procne]] from Book VI of the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' by [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Newman |first=Jane |title=And Let Mild Women to Him Lose Their Mildness': Philomela, Female Violence and Shakespeare's ''The Rape of Lucrece'' |journal=Shakespeare Quarterly |volume=45 |issue=3 |year=1994 |pages=304–326 |jstor=2871233 | doi = 10.2307/2871233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Newman's reading, the tradition of violent female revenge for rape represented by the myth of [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomel]] is repressed in Shakespeare's ''The Rape of Lucrece''. Shakespeare's poem faintly alludes to Ovid's myth, but does not present Procne and Philomel's method of revenge as an authentic option for Lucrece. Although Lucrece maintains the ability to speak after the rape (in contrast to the mutilated Philomela who loses all speech), Newman argues that the poem actually limits Lucrece's ability to act precisely by celebrating her self-sacrifice: "The apparent contrast of a silent Philomela, robbed of the potential for such an impact on the political moment to which she belongs, effectively casts Lucretia's suicide as the only form of political intervention available to women."&lt;ref&gt;Newman 308&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Lucrece's rhetorical eloquence blocks the possibility that she herself could seek out a more active, violent retribution on Tarquin, her rapist, and the monarchical regime that he represents. Instead, her revenge must be carried out by male agents acting in her name, particularly [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]], the founder of the [[Roman Republic]], who imitates Lucrece's self-sacrificing rhetoric as he leads the rebellion against Tarquin's father, the king of Rome.

'''''The Tales of Hoffmann''''' is a 1951 British Technicolor film adaptation of [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s opera ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann]]'', written, produced and directed by the team of [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]] working under the umbrella of their production company, [[Powell and Pressburger|The Archers]].

The [[opera film]] stars [[Robert Rounseville]], [[Moira Shearer]], [[Robert Helpmann]] and [[Léonide Massine]], and features [[Pamela Brown (actress)|Pamela Brown]], [[Ludmilla Tchérina]] and [[Ann Ayars]]. Only Rounseville and Ayars sang their own roles.

It uses a soundtrack recorded for the film conducted by Sir [[Thomas Beecham]]; principal singers apart from Rounseville and Ayars were [[Dorothy Bond]], [[Margherita Grandi]], [[Monica Sinclair]] and Bruce Dargavel; the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] plays. The film's production team includes cinematographer [[Christopher Challis]] and production and costume designer [[Hein Heckroth]], who was nominated for two [[24th Academy Awards|1952 Academy Award]]s for his work.

==Plot==
{{See also|The Tales of Hoffmann#Plot}}
*In the prologue, [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmann]] is in the audience at a performance by Stella, a [[prima ballerina]], of "The Ballet of the Enchanted Dragonfly". Stella sends Hoffmann a note asking him to meet her after the performance, but the note is intercepted by his rival, Councillor Lindorf. Not having received her note,  Hoffmann goes to the tavern in the interval, where he tells the story of a clown, Kleinzach, and three stories of his past loves — Olympia, Giulietta and Antonia, and gets drunk.
*In the first story, Olympia is an [[automaton]] created by scientist Spalanzani  and magic spectacle maker Coppelius. Hoffmann falls for the doll, ignorant of her artifice and is mocked when he finally discovers she is 'automatic'.
*In the second story, Hoffmann in [[Venice]] falls for Giulietta, a [[courtesan]], but she seduces him to steal his reflection for the magician Dapertutto.
*In the third story, Antonia is a [[soprano]] suffering from an incurable illness and must not sing, but  the evil Dr Miracle makes her sing and she dies, breaking the hearts of Hoffmann and her father, Crespel.
*Finally, in the epilogue, Hoffmann explains that all three women are all aspects of his love, Stella, who then appears in the tavern and, seeing Hoffmann drunk and incapable, is led away by Councillor Lindorf.

==Adaptation==
Though the original French libretto is presented in English translation, the film is relatively faithful to the traditional adaptations of Offenbach's last opera, and incorporates his unfinished score with the thread of the plot. However, certain important changes were made in the process of adapting the story to film: 
*In the prologue of the film, all of Lindorf's music is excluded, making him a silent character. 
*Stella's profession is changed from an opera singer appearing in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' to a ballet dancer. 
*"The Tale of Antonia" is shortened, ending with the powerful trio for Antonia, the Ghost of her mother, and Dr. Miracle rather than Antonia's death scene. 
*The role of Nicklaus is abridged, though Nicklaus (as played by Pamela Brown) still appears.

==Production==
In the later years of their partnership, Powell became interested in what he termed "a composed film", a marriage of image to operatic music. The finale of ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' and the ballet sequence of ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'' were earlier steps toward his goal.

''The Tales of Hoffmann'' is an achievement of this ideal, as the entire opera was pre-recorded to create the soundtrack, and the movie was edited to the rhythms of the music. The production is completely without dialogue and, with the exception of Robert Rounseville and Ann Ayars, none of the actors did their own singing. Some of the singers had established careers in Britain at the time. Grahame Clifford, for example, had been a leading comedian with the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] for several years, and Monica Sinclair was fast becoming an audience favourite at [[Covent Garden]]; she would later become one of the company's most popular artists of the next two decades. The acting (especially by Helpmann) is highly stylised and similar to that of the silent film era.

Each tale is marked by its own individual primary colour, denoting its theme. "The Tale of Olympia", set in Paris, has yellow contours highlighting the farcical nature and tone of the first act. "The Tale of Giulietta" is a hellish depiction of Venice, where dark colours, especially red, are used. The final tale, set in Greece, uses different shades of blue, alluding to its sad nature. The set design is deliberately made to look artificial with the costumes similarly stylised. The opening scene of the "Tale of Giulietta" (where Giulietta performs the "[[Belle nuit, ô nuit d'amour|Barcarolle]]", the most famous theme of the opera) is staged on a gondola which moves through deliberately artificial Venetian canals, although it does not seem to actually move on the water.

''The Tales of Hoffmann'' was in production from 1–16 July 1950 at [[Shepperton Studios]] in [[Shepperton]], Surrey, in the UK

==Critical reception==
Following its world premiere in New York City, [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[D]espite its opulence, coupled with a brilliant rendering of the score by the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] under Sir [[Thomas Beecham]]'s bristling baton and some masterly singing of the [[libretto]] (in English) by a host of vocal cords, this film version of the opera is, ''in toto'', a vastly wearying show. And that is because it sates the senses without striking any real dramatic fire ... The inevitable question about this picture is how close does it come to matching the beauty and excitement of the same producers {{sic}} ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]''? Although the two films are basically different, a comparison is fair to this extent: ''The Red Shoes'' had warmth and vitality, ''Tales of Hoffmann'' is splendid and cold.&lt;ref name="nyt51"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Tales of Hoffmann'' Arrives; Lavish British Picture, With Huge Cast of Entertainers, Makes Bow at Bijou|date=5 April 1951|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE1DC1231E23BBC4D53DFB266838A649EDE|first=Bosley|last=Crowther|authorlink=Bosley Crowther|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reportedly, [[Cecil B. DeMille]] sent a letter to Powell and Pressburger, saying, "For the first time in my life, I was treated to Grand Opera where the beauty, power and scope of the music was equally matched by the visual presentation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.powell-pressburger.org/Reviews/51_Hoffmann/Hoff02.html|title= Fan Letter | first= Cecil B.|last= DeMille| authorlink= Cecil B. DeMille| publisher= powell-pressburger.org| accessdate= 21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2002 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' poll, [[George A. Romero]] called it his "favourite film of all time; the movie that made me want to make movies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=George+A.&amp;surname=Romero | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20021026160507/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=George+A.&amp;surname=Romero | archivedate= 26 October 2002 | title= George A. Romero: Top Ten | publisher= [[British Film Institute]]| accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years earlier, Romero had introduced the film as part of the "Dialogues: Talking with Pictures" programme at the [[1999 Toronto International Film Festival#Dialogues: Talking with Pictures|1999 Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://preview.reelviews.net/tiff99/tiff1.html |title= 1999 Toronto International Film Festival Daily Update #1: "And They're Off..." | first= James |last=Berardinelli | authorlink= James Berardinelli| date=
9 September 1999 |publisher=ReelViews.net | accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romero later taped an interview for the [[Criterion Collection]] edition of the film, discussing his love of the film and its influence on his career. Additionally, [[Martin Scorsese]], an ardent fan of Powell and Pressburger, provides an audio commentary track on the Criterion edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.criterion.com/films/748-the-tales-of-hoffmann|title= The Tales of Hoffman | first= Criterion|last= Collection| authorlink= Criterion Collection| publisher= criterion.com| accessdate= 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book on the British cinema, [[André Bazin]] is quoted as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The cinema thus creates here a new artistic monster: the best legs adorned by the best voice. Not only is opera liberated from its material constraints but also from its human limitations. Lastly, dance itself is renewed by the photography and the editing, which allows a kind of choreography of the second degree where the rhythm of the dance is served by that of the cinema.&lt;ref name=Bazin&gt;Bazin is quoted (and translated) in {{cite book |title=Cross-channel Perspectives: the French Reception of British Cinema |last=Kimmer |first=Leila |page=54 |publisher= Peter Lang |year=2009 |isbn=978-3-03911-360-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVOpdFnn9loC&amp;pg=PA54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Accolades==
At the [[24th Academy Awards]], ''The Tales of Hoffmann'' received two nominations, both for [[Hein Heckroth]], for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design, Color]]; the awards in both cases went to the crew of ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]''.

Powell and Pressburger were nominated for the Grand Prize of the [[1951 Cannes Film Festival]], and won the Exceptional Prize.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4085/year/1951.html |title=Festival de Cannes: ''The Tales of Hoffmann'' |accessdate=16 January 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also won the [[Silver Bear]] award for "Best Musical" at the [[1st Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale 1951"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1951/03_preistr_ger_1951/03_Preistraeger_1951.html |title=1st Berlin International Film Festival: Prize Winners |accessdate=21 December 2009 |work= berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allmovie [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:73712~T4 Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack was recorded at Shepperton Studios between May and September 1950, conducted by Sir [[Thomas Beecham]]. Decca obtained permission from London Films to release the soundtrack on LP. In response, Beecham sued: he had not approved the release, because the soundtrack did not truly represent his interpretation of the opera, due to the changes made for the film. On 20 March 1951 he failed to obtain a High Court injunction to prevent the release, but received assurances that it would be clearly labelled as taken from the soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charm.rhul.ac.uk/discography/decca.html|title=Decca Classical discography, 1929-2009|website=Charm.rhul.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015 re-release==
In March 2015, the [[4K resolution|4K restoration]] of the film, produced by [[Martin Scorsese]]'s [[The Film Foundation]], the [[British Film Institute]], and [[Studiocanal]], was released in the U.S. by [[Rialto Pictures]]. The restored version runs 136 minutes, including a final [[title sequence|credits sequence]] of all the performers and singers, not seen in any previous releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rialtopictures.com/catalogue/the-tales-of-hoffmann |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226182304/http://www.rialtopictures.com/catalogue/the-tales-of-hoffmann |archivedate=26 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

:''See [[Mythical theology]] for the theological concept.''
'''''Theologia mythologica''''' is a 1532 book by [[Georg Pictorius]]. It was one of the first treatises of [[Classical mythology]] in the [[German Renaissance]]. Pictorius interprets the Greek pantheon as [[allegory]], e.g. [[Cybele]] as the [[Earth]], her chariot wheels as symbolizing the rotation of the Earth.

'''Thierry Henri Philippe Baudet''' (born 28 January 1983) is a Dutch politician, jurist, columnist and historian who founded and leads the [[political party]] [[Forum for Democracy (Netherlands)|Forum for Democracy]] (FvD, {{lang-nl|Forum voor Democratie}}).

==Biography==
Born in [[Heemstede]] to a family of partial French and Indonesian origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ontdekjouwverhaal.nl/nieuws/52782-2/|title=De genealogie van Thierry Baudet {{!}} NGV|work=NGV|access-date=2018-07-13|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudet is a [[euroscepticism|eurosceptic]] and opposed to [[multiculturalism]]. Baudet is an advocate for a return to [[nation states]]; his party set up the [[Dutch Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement referendum, 2016]] with the [[GeenStijl]] website and the Burgercomité EU association, in which Baudet voted no.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.nrc.nl/next/2016/03/07/ze-delen-weinig-behalve-een-diepe-afkeer-van-euro-1596081|title=Ze delen weinig, behalve een diepe afkeer van Europa|accessdate= 20 March 2016|authorlink= [[Thijs Niemantsverdriet]]|date= 7 March 2016 |publisher=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|language=Dutch

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he gave a speech at the Flemish nationalist event [[IJzerwake]]. He also spoke at several [[Vlaams Belang]] conferences. Baudet maintains that his [[Conservatism|conservative]] political convictions have been largely influenced by two events in his first year as a history undergraduate in Amsterdam: the [[September 11 attacks]] and the [[assassination of Pim Fortuyn]]. In November 2016 Baudet co-signed a letter initiated by the German journalist [[Billy Six]] which requested [[Donald Trump]] to press for a new investigation regarding [[MH17]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/baudet-vraagt-trump-om-nieuw-onderzoek-naar-mh17-nabestaanden-geschokt~a4455637/?_sp=577b2d76-f88f-44e8-9c62-38351ac182cf.1505931431413&lt;/ref&gt;

Baudet features regularly in both print and visual media in Europe. As a journalist he has had a permanent column in ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', and is published in ''[[Le Monde]]'', PressEurope and European Ideas. Recently he has been active as a commentator in [[Studio PowNed]] on the Dutch public television. As an academic teacher and researcher Baudet focuses on questions of law, history and political philosophy through a multidisciplinary approach.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/next/2016/03/07/ze-delen-weinig-behalve-een-diepe-afkeer-van-euro-1596081|author= [[Thijs Niemantsverdriet]]|title=Ze delen weinig, behalve een diepe afkeer van Europa|accessdate= 20 March 2016|date= 7 March 2016 |publisher=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|language=Dutch|quote=dutch original "Hij noemt zichzelf zonder terughoudendheid "de belangrijkste intellectueel van Nederland".

===Member of the House of Representatives===
In the [[Dutch general election, 2017|general election of 2017]] his newly founded party won two seats in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], Baudet being elected alongside [[Theo Hiddema]].

== Controversy ==
In February 2018 Baudet was confronted with the question whether there is a relation between [[Race and intelligence|IQ and race]] in a debate with [[Femke Halsema]]. Hiddema and the number two on Baudet's party list for the [[Dutch municipal elections, 2018]] in Amsterdam, Yernaz Ramautarsing, stated they believed it to be true while Baudet refused to answer the question. Deputy Prime Minister [[Kajsa Ollongren]] stated that Forum for Democracy is a bigger threat than the PVV and that members have an unhealthy fascination for race differences; Baudet made a complaint for [[defamation]] at an Amsterdam police station. Hiddema supported him as his [[advocate]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/1624498/baudet-aangifte-wegens-smaad-en-laster Baudet aangifte small en laster] (in Dutch), ''De Telegraaf''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a debate a few days later, he no longer refused to answer the question and mentioned he shares Ramautarsing's opinion on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parool.nl/verkiezingen/alle-ballen-op-baudet-in-haags-amsterdams-verkiezingsdebat~a4568769/ All balloon op Baudet in Haags Amsterdams verkiezingsdebat] (in Dutch), ''Parool''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions and opinions==
Baudet is a [[National conservatism|national conservative]] and [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptic]], advocating for both Netherlands' exit from the European Union and its eventual dissolution. He is against further unskilled [[immigration]] into the Netherlands. In a speech he spoke about immigration causing a [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] [[dilution (equation)|dilution]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nporadio1.nl/dit-is-de-dag/onderwerpen/400417-baudet-snapt-ophef-om-homeopatische-verdunning-niet&lt;/ref&gt; and in an interview he said he prefers a dominant white and cultural Europe as it is.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpBzt9PyU5w&lt;/ref&gt; He is opposed to [[Ukraine]] joining the [[European Union]].

Baudet has a strong opinion on [[art]]s, the topic of his book ''[[Oikofobie]]'', and considers non-Western art and Western post-1900 [[modernism]] in [[visual arts]] inferior to Western [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], encourages education and programmation of [[tonal music]] opposed to [[atonal music]] and dislikes modern post-1950 [[architecture]].

Baudet frequently speaks about the perceived existence of a "party cartel", in which the main ruling parties of the country divide power among themselves and conspire towards the same goals, despite claiming to be competitors.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4520bb4c-07e3-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=14 March 2017|title=Populists seize the moment as Dutch fall out of love with EU|author=Joshua Chaffin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudet is not religious, but he is sympathetic with [[Christianity|Christian]] values. In an interview, he called himself an "[[agnostic]] [[cultural Christian]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [https://cip.nl/60959-thierry-baudet-pleit-voor-herwaardering-christendom Thierry Baudet pleit voor herwaardering christendom], ''cip.nl'', 15 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baudet and the media==
Since Baudet entered the States General with his political party, he became a hot topic in the Dutch media with daily new analytic articles, background checks, gossip, and interviews. His broad international network is a prominent re-occurring chapter in the debate whether his political position is extreme right, racist, or fascistic. He had contact with [[Jared Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://decorrespondent.nl/7738/thierry-baudet-ontmoette-in-het-geheim-een-amerikaanse-racist-van-alt-right/376817386-2d11d76b ''De Correspondent'' article] (in Dutch).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milo Yiannopoulos]], [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] and [[Filip Dewinter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://decorrespondent.nl/7955/hoe-thierry-baudet-aan-de-lippen-hing-van-jean-marie-le-pen/811713530980-29774dcf ''De Correspondent'' article] (in Dutch).&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks about non-Western immigrants as the cause of an "homeopathic dilution" of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trouw.nl/opinie/van-homeopathische-verdunning-naar-seksuele-verdunning~a9191e0b/ ''Trouw'' article] (in Dutch).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Torricelli languages''' are a [[language family|family]] of about fifty languages of the northern [[Papua New Guinea]] coast, spoken by only about 80,000 people. They are named after the [[Torricelli Mountains]]. The most populous and best known Torricelli language is the [[Arapesh languages|Arapesh]], with about 30,000 speakers.

The most promising{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2017}} external relationship for the Torricelli family is the [[Sepik languages]]. In reconstructions of both families, the pronouns have a plural suffix ''*-m'' and a [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] suffix ''*-p''.

The Torricelli languages occupy three geographically separated areas, evidently separated by migrations of Sepik-language speakers several centuries ago.

==Classification==
[[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]] linked the Wapei and Monumbo branches, and the coastal western and eastern extremes of the family, in 1905. The family was more fully established by David Laycock in 1965. Most recently, Ross broke up Laycock and Z’graggen's (1975) '''Kombio branch''', placing the Kombio language in the Palei branch and leaving Wom as on its own, with the other languages ([[Eitiep language|Eitiep]], [[Torricelli language|Torricelli]] (Lou), [[Yambes language|Yambes]], [[Aruek language|Aruek]]) unclassified due to lack of data. Usher tentatively separates Monumbo, Marienberg, and the [[Taiap language|Taiap]] (Gapun) isolate in a 'Sepik Coast' branch, separated from the rest of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/torricelli-range-sepik-coast/sepik-coast|title=Sepik Coast - newguineaworld|author=|date=|website=sites.google.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ethnologue'' also lists [[Bragat language|Bragat]] in the Palei branch.

==Typological overview==
The Torricelli languages are unusual among Papuan languages in having a basic clause order of SVO (subject–verb–object). (In contrast, most Papuan languages have SOV order.) It was previously believed that the Torricelli word order was a result of contact with Austronesian languages, but it is now thought more likely that SVO order was present in the Torricelli proto-language. {{sfn|Donohue|2005}}

[[File:The Procession of the Trojan Horse in Troy by Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo.jpg|thumb|Detail from ''The Procession of the Trojan Horse in Troy'' by [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo|Domenico Tiepolo]] (1773), inspired by Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'']]

The '''Trojan Horse''' is a story from the [[Trojan War]] about the [[Stratagem (deception)|subterfuge]] that the Greeks used to enter the independent city of [[Troy]] and win the war. In the [[Canon (basic principle)| canonical]] version, after a fruitless 10-year siege, the Greeks constructed a huge wooden [[horse]], and hid a select force of men inside including [[Odysseus]]. The Greeks pretended to sail away, and the Trojans pulled the horse into their city as a victory trophy. That night the Greek force crept out of the horse and opened the gates for the rest of the Greek army, which had sailed back under cover of night. The Greeks entered and destroyed the city of Troy, ending the war.

[[Metaphor]]ically a "Trojan Horse" has come to mean any trick or stratagem that causes a target to invite a foe into a securely protected bastion or place. A [[malware|malicious computer program]] which tricks users into willingly running it is also called a [[Trojan horse (computing)|"Trojan horse"]] or simply a "Trojan".

The main ancient source for the story is the ''[[Aeneid]]'' of [[Virgil]], a [[Latin]] [[epic poem]] from the time of [[Augustus]]. The event is also referred to in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Broeniman|first1=Clifford|title=Demodocus, Odysseus, and the Trojan War in "Odyssey" 8|journal=The Classical World|date=1996|volume=90|issue=1|pages=3–13|jstor=4351895}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Greek tradition, the horse is called the "wooden horse" (δουράτεος ἵππος ''dourateos hippos'' in [[Homeric Greek|Homeric]]/[[Ionic Greek]] (''Odyssey'' 8.512); δούρειος ἵππος, ''doureios hippos'' in [[Attic Greek]]).

According to [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], [[Odysseus]] thought of building a great wooden horse (the horse being the emblem of Troy), hiding an elite force inside, and fooling the Trojans into wheeling the horse into the city as a trophy.  Under the leadership of [[Epeius]], the Greeks built the wooden horse in three days. Odysseus's plan called for one man to remain outside the horse; he would act as though the Greeks had abandoned him, leaving the horse as a gift for the Trojans. An inscription was engraved on the horse reading: "For their return home, the Greeks dedicate this offering to Athena". Then they burned their tents and left to Tenedos by night. Greek soldier [[Sinon]] was "abandoned", and was to signal to the Greeks by lighting a beacon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]], Epitome, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+Epit.+E.5.15&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 e.5.15]&lt;/ref&gt; In Virgil's poem, Sinon, the only volunteer for the role, successfully convinces the Trojans that he has been left behind and that the Greeks are gone. Sinon tells the Trojans that the Horse is an offering to the goddess [[Athena]], meant to atone for the previous desecration of her temple at Troy by the Greeks, and ensure a safe journey home for the Greek fleet. Sinon tells the Trojans that the Horse was built to be too large for them to take it into their city and gain the favor of Athena for themselves.

While questioning Sinon, the Trojan priest [[Laocoön]] guesses the plot and warns the Trojans, in Virgil's famous line ''[[Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes]]'' ("I fear Greeks, even those bearing gifts"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/VirgilAeneidII.htm#_Toc536009311 |title=Virgil:Aeneid II |publisher=Poetryintranslation.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danai ([[accusative|{{smallcaps|'''acc'''}}]] ''Danaos'') or [[Danaans]]  (Homer's name for the Greeks) being the ones who had built the Trojan Horse. However, the god [[Poseidon]] sends two sea serpents to strangle him and his sons Antiphantes and Thymbraeus before any Trojan heeds his warning. According to [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] the two serpents were sent by [[Apollo]], whom Laocoon had insulted by sleeping with his wife in front of the "divine image".&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', Epitome,[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DEpitome%3Abook%3DE%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D18 Epit. E.5.18]&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Odyssey'', Homer says that [[Helen of Troy]] also guesses the plot and tries to trick and uncover the Greek soldiers inside the horse by imitating the voices of their wives, and [[Anticlus]] attempts to answer, but Odysseus shuts his mouth with his hand.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, Odyssey, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D4%3Acard%3D265 4. 274-289].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Priam|King Priam's]] daughter [[Cassandra]], the [[Fortune-telling|soothsayer]] of Troy, insists that the horse will be the downfall of the city and its royal family. She too is ignored, hence their doom and loss of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil.  ''The Aeneid.''  Trans. Robert Fitzgerald.  New York: Everyman's Library, 1992.  Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Trojan War}}
This incident is mentioned in the ''[[Odyssey]]'':
: ''What a thing was this, too, which that mighty man wrought and endured in the carven horse, wherein all we chiefs of the [[Argives]] were sitting, bearing to the Trojans death and fate!'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=hom.+od.+4.271 4.271 ff]
: ''But come now, change thy theme, and sing of the building of the horse of wood, which [[Epeius]] made with [[Athena]]'s help, the horse which once Odysseus led up into the citadel as a thing of guile, when he had filled it with the men who sacked Ilion.'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=hom.+od.+8.487 8.492-3 ff] (trans. [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]])

The most detailed and most familiar version is in Virgil's ''Aeneid'', Book II&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/VirgilAeneidII.htm#_Toc536009309|title=Virgil|work=poetryintranslation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (trans. A. S. Kline).

:''After many years have slipped by, the leaders of the Greeks,&lt;br&gt;
:''opposed by the Fates, and damaged by the war,&lt;br&gt;
:''build a horse of mountainous size, through Pallas's divine art,&lt;br&gt;
:''and weave planks of fir over its ribs:&lt;br&gt;
:''they pretend it's a votive offering: this rumour spreads.&lt;br&gt;
:''They secretly hide a picked body of men, chosen by lot,&lt;br&gt;
:''there, in the dark body, filling the belly and the huge&lt;br&gt;
:''cavernous insides with armed warriors.
:[...]&lt;br&gt;
:''Then Laocoön rushes down eagerly from the heights&lt;br&gt;
:''of the citadel, to confront them all, a large crowd with him,&lt;br&gt; 
:''and shouts from far off: "O unhappy citizens, what madness?&lt;br&gt; 
:''Do you think the enemy's sailed away? Or do you think&lt;br&gt;
:''any Greek gift's free of treachery? Is that Ulysses's reputation?&lt;br&gt; 
:''Either there are Greeks in hiding, concealed by the wood,&lt;br&gt; 
:''or it's been built as a machine to use against our walls,&lt;br&gt; 
:''or spy on our homes, or fall on the city from above,&lt;br&gt; 
:''or it hides some other trick: Trojans, don't trust this horse.&lt;br&gt;
:''Whatever it is, I'm afraid of Greeks even those bearing gifts."&lt;br&gt; 

Book II includes [[Laocoön]] saying: "''[[Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes|Equo ne credite, Teucri. Quidquid id est, timeo Danaos et dona ferentes]].''" ("Do not trust the horse, Trojans!  Whatever it is, I fear the Greeks, even bringing gifts.")

Well before Virgil, the story is also alluded to in Greek classical literature. In [[Euripides]]' play ''[[Trojan Women]]'', written in 415 BC, the god Poseidon proclaims: "For, from his home beneath Parnassus, Phocian Epeus, aided by the craft of Pallas, framed a horse to bear within its womb an armed host, and sent it within the battlements, fraught with death; whence in days to come men shall tell of 'the wooden horse,' with its hidden load of warriors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Euripides/troj_women.html |title=The Trojan Women, Euripides |publisher=Classics.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Men in the horse==
Thirty of the Achaeans' best warriors hid in the Trojan horse's belly and two spies in its mouth. Other sources give different numbers: The ''Bibliotheca'' 50;&lt;ref&gt;Epitome 5.14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tzetzes]] 23;&lt;ref&gt;Posthomerica 641–650&lt;/ref&gt; and Quintus Smyrnaeus gives the names of 30, but says there were more.&lt;ref&gt;Posthomerica xii.314-335&lt;/ref&gt; In late tradition the number was standardized at 40. Their names follow:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maicar.com/GML/WOODENHORSE.html |title=THE WOODEN HORSE - Greek Mythology Link |publisher=Maicar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factual explanations ==
There has been speculation that the Trojan Horse may have been a [[battering ram]] or other sort of [[siege engine]] resembling, to some extent, a horse, and that the description of the use of this device was then transformed into a myth by later [[oral history|oral historians]] who were not present at the battle and were unaware of that meaning of the name. [[Ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]] at the time used siege machines with animal names, often covered with dampened horse hides to protect against flaming arrows; it is possible that the Trojan Horse was such.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], in his book "In search of the Trojan war" {{ISBN|978-0-520-21599-3}} (which was shown on BBC TV as a series)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], who lived in the 2nd century AD, wrote in his book ''[[Description of Greece]]'' "That the work of Epeius was a contrivance to make a breach in the Trojan wall is known to everybody who does not attribute utter silliness to the [[Phrygians]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=paus.+1.1.1 |title= Pausanias, Description of Greece 1, XXIII,8 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, by Phrygians, he means the Trojans.
[[File:Hippos 2.jpg|thumb|left|The Phoenician ship called "hippos". From the Assyrian city of Khorsabad, VIII century BC.]]
Some authors have suggested that the gift might also have been a ship, with warriors hidden inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56321915|title=Troy c. 1700-1250 BC|last=Fields|first=Nic|date=2004|publisher=Osprey|others=Spedaliere, Donato and Spedaliere, Sarah Sulemsohn (illustrators)|year=|isbn=1841767034|location=Oxford|pages=51-52|oclc=56321915}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that the terms used to put men in the horse are those used by ancient Greek authors when describing the embarkation of men on a ship, and that there are analogies between the building of ships by Paris at the beginning of the Trojan saga and the building of the horse at the end;&lt;ref&gt;See pages 22-26 in ''The fall of Troy in early Greek poetry and art'', Michael John Anderson, Oxford University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; ships are called "sea-horses" once in the Odyssey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Arbulo Bayona|first=Joaquin Ruiz|date=2009|title=LOS NAVEGANTES Y LO SAGRADO.

A more speculative theory, originally proposed by [[Fritz Schachermeyr]], states that the Trojan Horse is a metaphor for a destructive [[earthquake]] that damaged the walls of Troy and allowed the [[Greeks]] in.&lt;ref name="Quake"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Trojan War: A Very Short Introduction|author=Eric H. Cline|year=2013|isbn=0199333823}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his theory, the horse represents [[Poseidon]], who as well as being god of the sea was also god of horses and earthquakes. This theory is supported by the fact that archaeological digs have found that [[Troy#Troy VI and VII|Troy VI]] was heavily damaged in an [[earthquake]],&lt;ref name="Quake"/&gt; but is hard to square with [[Poseidon#Walls of Troy|the mythological claim that Poseidon himself built the walls of Troy]] in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief Guide to Classical Civilization|author=Stephen Kershaw|year=2010|isbn=1849018006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient representations==
Pictorial representations of the Trojan Horse earlier than, or contemporary to, the first literary appearances of the episode can help clarify what was the meaning of the story as perceived by its contemporary audience.

{{World Cinema}}

'''World cinema''' is not the sum-total of all films made around the world. Its use is analogous to the use of the term "world literature". Goethe used the concept of [[World literature|''Weltliteratur'']] (world literature) in several of his essays in the early decades of the nineteenth century to describe the international circulation and reception of literary works in Europe, including works of non-Western origin. An interest in "world cinema" suggests an awareness of high-quality films made outside the Hollywood studio system which dominates international viewership. However, some people use the term to refer to the [[film]] and [[film industry|film industries]] of non-English-speaking countries in English-speaking countries. Equating the dominant form of cinema with the dominant language (English) can be inherently problematic.There are many countries such as Canada, England, South Africa and even Asian countries like India, where films are made in English but they are part of "world cinema" due to their marginal status in terms of access or viewership. It can be argued that an understanding of "world cinema" centering around Hollywood cinema suggests an [[Eurocentric]] view. "World cinema" is often used interchangeably with the term '''foreign film'''. "Foreign" is also a relative term, suggesting a Western viewpoint. One person's national cinema can be another person's foreign film. In fact, American [[Independent film|independent cinema]] may be considered part of "world cinema" as it does not have adequate access. 

Technically, ''foreign film'' does not mean the same as ''foreign language film'', but the inference is that a foreign film is not only foreign in terms of the country of production, but also in terms of the language used.  As such, the use of the term ''foreign film'' for films produced in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada or other English-speaking countries would be uncommon within other English-speaking countries. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Types==
World cinema has an unofficial implication of films with "artistic value" as opposed to "Hollywood commercialism." Foreign language films are often grouped with "[[Art film|art house films]]" and other [[independent film]]s in DVD stores, cinema listings etc.
Unless dubbed into one's native language, foreign language films played in English-speaking regions usually have English [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]]. Few films of this kind receive more than a limited release and many are never played in major cinemas. As such the marketing, popularity and gross takings for these films are usually markedly less than for typical Hollywood [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]]. The combination of subtitles and minimal exposure adds to the notion that "World Cinema" has an inferred artistic prestige or intelligence, which may discourage less sophisticated viewers. Additionally, differences in cultural style and tone between foreign and domestic films affects attendance at cinemas and DVD sales.&lt;ref name="Curran 500"&gt;Curran, Daniel. ''Foreign Films: More than 500 films on video cassette,'' pages v-vi. Evanston, Illinois: CineBooks, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign language films can be commercial, [[Low culture|low brow]] or [[B-movie]]s. Furthermore, foreign language films can cross cultural boundaries, particularly when the visual spectacle and style is sufficient to overcome people's misgivings. Films of this type became more common in the early 2000s, as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'', ''[[Amélie]]'',  ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'', ''[[Y Tu Mama Tambien]]'' and ''[[Talk to Her]]'' enjoyed great successes in United States cinemas and [[home video]] sales. The first foreign and foreign language film to top the North American [[box office]] was ''[[Hero (movie)|Hero]]'' in August 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Hero' Soars to Late August Record|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1445&amp;p=.htm|work=boxofficemojo.com|author=Brandon Gray|date=August 29, 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004023456/http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1445&amp;p=.htm|archivedate=October 4, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The rule for foreign-language films is that if you've done $5 million or better (in United States cinemas), you've had a very nice success; if you do $10 (million) or better (in United States cinemas), you're in blockbuster category," [[Warner Independent Pictures]] ex-president Mark Gill said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703133158/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000724461|title=Foreign affairs|date=3 July 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, English-dubbed foreign films rarely did well in United States box office (except [[Anime]] films).  The 1982 United States theatrical release of Wolfgang Peterson’s ''[[Das Boot]]'' was the last major release to go out in both original and English-dubbed versions, and the film's original version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/1999/08/editorial-life-isnt-beautiful-anymore-its-dubbed-82123/|title=EDITORIAL: Life Isn’t Beautiful Anymore, it’s Dubbed|date=23 August 1999|website=Indiewire.com|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20180805152511/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&amp;gwt=pay|title=Will Dubbing Fly in the U.S.?

Later on, English-dubbed versions of international hits like ''[[Un indien dans la ville]]'', ''[[Godzilla 2000]]'', ''[[Anatomy (film)|Anatomy]]'', ''[[Pinocchio (2002 film)|Pinocchio]]'' and ''[[High Tension]]'' flopped at United States box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1996/04/02/little-indian-big-mistake/be40c0e7-fbb7-42ba-aa35-8481c485f29a/?utm_term=.3e5fbdab6cf5&amp;noredirect=on|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180718041749/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1996/04/02/little-indian-big-mistake/be40c0e7-fbb7-42ba-aa35-8481c485f29a/?utm_term=.3e5fbdab6cf5&amp;noredirect=on|deadurl=yes|title=LITTLE INDIAN': BIG MISTAKE - The Washington Post|date=18 July 2018|archivedate=18 July 2018|website=Archive.today|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeguru.com/082100.htm|title=Weekend Box Office|first=Gitesh|last=Pandya|website=Boxofficeguru.com|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/07/entertainment/et-horn7|title='Pinocchio' will try again, in Italian|first=John|last=Horn|date=7 February 2003|website=Articles.latimes.com|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2009/10/girl-with-dragon-tattoo-gets-u-s-release-239436/|title=Girl with Dragon Tattoo Gets U.S. Release|first=Anne|last=Thompson|date=11 October 2009|website=Indiewire.com|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When Miramax planned to release the English-dubbed versions of ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'' and ''[[Hero (movie)|Hero]]'' in the United States cinemas, their English-dubbed versions scored badly in test screenings in the United States, so Miramax finally released the films in United States cinemas with their original language.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Xu|first=Gary G.|title=Sinascape: Contemporary Chinese Cinema|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|year=2007|page=44|isbn=0742554503}}&lt;/ref&gt;
