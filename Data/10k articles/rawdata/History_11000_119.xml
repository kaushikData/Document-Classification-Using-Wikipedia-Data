{{Year nav topic5|1981|radio|music|television|home video}}

The year '''1981 in radio''' involved some significant events.

==Debuts==
*March – KWNT (1580 AM) of [[Davenport, Iowa]], switches from its longtime country music format – which it had held since the 1950s, including under its previous call sign KFMA – to a [[golden oldies]] format, emphasizing music of the 1930s through early 1950s. It is the first in a series of format switches at the frequency over the next 19 years – formats ranged from oldies to soul to black gospel – all of them unsuccessful.
*March 30 - Radio stations across America interrupt regular programming following [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|an assassination attempt]] against President [[Ronald Reagan]] outside the Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C.
*April 12 – [[KDKA-FM|WJOI]]/[[Pittsburgh]] flipped from [[beautiful music]] to [[Top 40]], branded as "B94", and adopted the new call letters "WBZZ." That fall, [[WXYT-FM|WWJ-FM]], a beautiful music station in [[Detroit]], picks up the WJOI calls.
*June 1 – [[CJCB-FM]] Sydney, Nova Scotia flips from Easy Listening to Country. Along with the format change, the station changes its call letters to CKPE-FM.
* September 22 – [[WOGL|WCAU-FM]] in [[Philadelphia]] debuts a new [[Hot Hits]] format called "98 Now!" which sweeps the local ratings and inspires parent company CBS to look at converting its other FM stations to similar formats.
* October — "The Weekly Country Music Countdown," a three-hour weekly countdown program featuring the top 30 country hits of the week as reported by ''[[Radio &amp; Records]]'' magazine. Hosted by radio personality Chris Charles, the show is the first successful rival to "[[American Country Countdown]]."

==Deaths==
* March 10 - [[Bob Elson]], an American "pioneer in broadcast journalism" best known for his broadcasting of baseball games of the [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Chicago White Sox]].&lt;ref name="trib034481"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Condon|first1=David|title=Ex-Sox, Cubs Broadcaster Elson dies at 76|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1981/03/11/page/1/article/ex-sox-cubs-broadcaster-elson-dies-at-76|accessdate=14 January 2015|agency=Chicago Tribune|date=March 11, 1981|ref=trib031181}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The World Monuments Watch is a flagship advocacy program of the [[New York City|New York]]-based private [[non-profit organization]] [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) that calls international attention to [[cultural heritage]] around the world that is threatened by [[neglect]], [[vandalism]], [[war|conflict]], or [[natural disaster|disaster]].&lt;ref name=press_release&gt;{{cite web | title = WORLD MONUMENTS FUND ANNOUNCES 2010 WORLD MONUMENTS WATCH LIST OF 100 MOST ENDANGERED SITES | author = Holly Evarts | date = 6 October 2009 | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url =

==Selection process==
Every two years, it publishes a select list known as the Watch List of Endangered Sites that are in urgent need of [[Historic preservation|preservation]] funding and protection. The sites are nominated by governments, conservation professionals, site caretakers, [[non-government organization]]s (NGOs), concerned individuals, and others working in the field.&lt;ref name=press_release /&gt; An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the sites, the urgency of the threat, and the viability of both advocacy and conservation solutions.&lt;ref name=press_release /&gt; For the succeeding two-year period until a new Watch List is published, these 100 sites can avail grants and funds from the WMF, as well as from other foundations, private donors, and corporations by capitalizing on the publicity and attention gained from the inclusion on the Watch List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WORLD MONUMENTS FUND ANNOUNCES 2006 WORLD MONUMENTS WATCH LIST OF 100 MOST ENDANGERED SITES |author=Holly Evarts |date=6 October 2009 |publisher=World Monuments Fund |url=http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |accessdate=8 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516051456/http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the '''40th century BC''', the Near East and southeastern Europe were in the [[Chalcolithic]] period (Copper Age), transitional between the Stone and the Bronze Ages. Northwestern Europe was in the Neolithic. China was dominated by the Neolithic [[Yangshao culture]]. The Americas were in a phase of transition between the [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]] (Lithic) to the [[Meso-Indian]] (Archaic) stage. This century started in 4000 BC and ended in 3901 BC.

'''Angus Lindsay Ritchie Calder''' (5 February 1942 – 5 June 2008) was a Scottish academic, writer, historian, educator and literary editor with a background in English literature, politics and [[cultural studies]].  He was a man of the Left, and in his highly influential book on the home front in the Second World War he complained bitterly that the postwar reforms of the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]], such as universal health care and nationalization of some industries, were an inadequate reward for the wartime sacrifices, and a cynical betrayal of the people's hope for a more just postwar society.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Calder, ''The Peoples War: Britain, 1939 – 1945'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Angus Calder was born on 5 February 1942. His father, [[Peter Ritchie Calder|Lord Ritchie Calder]] (1906–1982), was a noted [[science writer]], [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[pacifist]]. His siblings are [[Nigel Calder]], mathematician Allan Calder and educationist Isla Calder (1946–2000). His nephew is travel writer and journalist [[Simon Calder]].

Calder read English literature at [[King's College, Cambridge]], and wrote a doctorate at the [[University of Sussex]], on [[politics in the United Kingdom]] during [[World War II]]. His book, ''The People's War: Britain 1939–1945'', was published in 1969.

==Career==
Calder became a ubiquitous figure on the Scottish literary scene, writing essays and articles, books on [[Byron]] and [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], and working as editor of collections of poetry and prose. He also wrote introductions to new publications of such diverse works as ''[[Great Expectations]]'', [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Old Mortality]]'', [[T. E. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'', [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[Sword of Honour]]'' trilogy and [[James Boswell|Boswell]]'s ''[[The Life of Samuel Johnson]]''.

In 1981 he published ''Revolutionary Empire'' (1981), a study of three centuries of imperial development by English speakers to the end of the 18th century. ''Revolving Culture: Notes from the Scottish Republic'' is a collection of essays on [[Scottish topics]] which expressed itself through the writings of such figures as [[Robert Burns|Burns]] and Scott and in gestures of [[realpolitik]] such as the repression of "[[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]]" during the [[French Revolution]]. In 1984 Calder helped to set up the [[Scottish Poetry Library]] in Edinburgh and served as its first convener. He also worked as an editor of [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]'s prose.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/angus-calder-historian-author-and-poet-1-1172007|title=Angus Calder: Historian, author and poet|publisher=''The Scotsman''|date=9 June 2008|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Myth of The Blitz'' (1991) argued that received ideas of the civilian population's reaction to [[the Blitz|the bombing of London]] still reflected wartime propaganda. Calder examined how the German bombings generated ideas and images of plucky and stoical suffering and resistance that defined post-war Britain's sense of itself; but showed that the "chirpy Cockney", "all pull together" stereotypes were partly propaganda which hid the reality of an inequality of suffering due to deep social divisions, and concealed unheroic stories of opportunistic looting and rape.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/angus-calder-historian-critic-and-poet-whose-the-peoples-war-challenged-conventional-wisdom-on-wartime-britain-843573.html|title=Angus Calder: Historian, critic and poet whose 'The People's War' challenged conventional wisdom on wartime Britain|publisher=''The Independent''|author=Ian Campbell|date=10 June 2008|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nationalist and socialist, he moved from the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) to the [[Scottish Socialist Party]], and though he cherished the [[Scottish republican]] spirit, he sought to challenge some of the popular myths surrounding the country's sense of national identity. In ''Revolving Culture: Notes from a Scottish republic'' (1992) he described the development, during the early stages of the Union with England, of an "intellectual republic" forged by a combination of insularity and lack of English interest in Scottish affairs.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; In 1997 he edited ''Time to Kill — the Soldier's Experience of War in the West 1939–1945'' with [[Paul Addison]]; ''Scotlands of the Mind'' (2002); ''Disasters and Heroes: On War, Memory and Representation'' (2004); and ''Gods, Mongrels and Demons: 101 Brief but Essential Lives'' (2004), a collection of potted biographies of "creatures who have extended my sense of the potentialities, both comic and tragic, of human nature". He had always published verse and won a Gregory Award  for his poetry in 1967. Questions of [[Scottish national identity]] assumed growing importance in the 1980s, and Calder became active in the debate. A distinctive "Scottish social ethos" informed the activities of prominent Scots in the years of Empire, when they had invested heavily in the concept of [[Britishness]], although he reportedly felt that the Scots had meddled much more overweeningly with the English sense of identity than the English ever did with the Scots. He was delighted to discover that the game of [[cricket]] had been introduced to [[Cricket in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] by a Scot.&lt;ref name="Telegraph Obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2119621/Angus-Calder.html | title=Obituaries: Angus Calder | work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=June 12, 2008 | accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calder spent much of his career in [[Edinburgh]], where he became a conspicuous figure on the [[Scottish literature|Scottish literary]] scene as a published poet and commentator on [[Scottish culture]] and [[Scottish politics|politics]]. Calder taught all over the world, lecturing in literature at several African universities and serving from 1981 to 1987 as co-editor of the ''[[Journal of Commonwealth Literature]]''.&lt;ref name=Independent /&gt;

Calder won the [[Eric Gregory Award]] for his poetry and the 1970 [[John Llewellyn Rhys Prize]] in 1967. In 1971, after the publication of ''The People's War'', the Calders moved to Edinburgh, where he published ''Russia Discovered'', a survey of 19th-century Russian fiction in 1976, and, three years later, became staff tutor in Arts with the [[Open University]].

==Personal life==
His first wife was [[Jenni Calder|Jennifer Daiches]], daughter of Scottish literary critic [[David Daiches]], with whom Calder collaborated on a book about [[Sir Walter Scott]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="unity"/&gt; The Calders had two daughters, Rachel and Gowan, and a son, Gideon. His first marriage ended in 1982; he married Kate Kyle in 1986, with whom he had a son, Douglas, born in 1989. He took early retirement from the Open University in 1995.

==Death==
Calder died from lung cancer on 5 June 2008, aged 66.&lt;ref name="unity"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2119621/Angus-Calder.html|title=Angus Calder: Historian who challenged the popular conception of British national unity during the Second World War|publisher=''The Telegraph''|date=12 June 2008|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Falklands War}}

The '''last stage of the [[Falklands War]]''' was the [[surrender (military)|surrender]] of the Argentine Governor at [[Port Stanley]].

==Background==

With the last natural defence line at [[Mount Tumbledown]] breached, the Argentine town defences of [[Port Stanley]] began to falter. In the morning gloom, one company commander got lost and his junior officers became despondent. Private Santiago Carrizo of the 3rd Regiment described how a [[platoon commander]] ordered them to take up positions in the houses and "if a [[Falkland Islanders|Kelper]] resists, shoot him", but the entire company did nothing of the kind.&lt;ref name="fn_4"&gt;[[Max Hastings]] &amp; [[Simon Jenkins]], The Battle For The Falklands, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

At 2100 hours on 14 June 1982, the commander of the Argentine garrison in Stanley, General [[Mario Menéndez]], surrendered to the Major General [[Jeremy Moore]]. The surrender was in conflict with the Argentine Army code stating that a surrender was illegal unless more than 50% of the men were casualties and 75% of the ammunition was spent.&lt;ref&gt;"That under the military code of conduct Menendez would not be expected to surrender until he had lost half his men and three-quarters of his ammunition, otherwise he should expect to be court-martialled." - Freedman, Lawrence: Signals of war (1990) Faber and faber. {{ISBN|0-571-14144-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms of the surrender document were slightly changed after negotiation by General Menéndez. 
The phrase [[unconditional surrender]] was changed for the term [[Surrender (military)|surrender]]. The Argentines were granted:
[[Image:SS Canberra &amp; HMS Andromeda Falklands 1982.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[HMS Andromeda (F57)|HMS ''Andromeda'']] and [[SS Canberra|SS ''Canberra'']] outside Port Stanley on 16 June 1982]]
* The Argentines units will retain their flags.
* The units will remain under control of their respective officers
* The surrender ceremony will be private (not public)
* The Argentine officers will retain their sidearms.
* The final point about the returning of the 11,313 [[prisoners of war]] in their own ships was not accepted and 4,167 of them were [[repatriation|repatriated]] to Argentina on the ocean liner [[SS Canberra|''Canberra'']] alone. The [[National Reorganization Process|junta]] had falsely claimed that the liner had been crippled during the [[Battle of San Carlos (1982)|Battle of San Carlos]].

Some of the equipment was rendered useless by Argentine personnel before the surrender.

The Argentine '''Rattenbach commission''' ({{lang-es|Informe Rattenbach}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cescem.org.ar/informe_rattenbach/index.html ''Informe Rattenbach''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; was assembled after the war to investigate the causes of defeat. It recommended serious penalties for some of the officers in charge&lt;!-- than it described like a ''military adventure'' (who implied the maximum penalty for some of them) Jor, I'm afraid I couldn't understand the translation of this part, can we discuss it on the talk please friend.--&gt;, but its influence on the later trial was practically nil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kiwidepia.com/kiwi/aS9uL2YvSW5mb3JtZV9SYXR0ZW5iYWNoXzVjNjk= Rattenbach report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Telegram Moore Falklands.jpg|thumb|Telegram from General Moore reporting the Argentine surrender.]]
On 20 June, the British retook the [[South Sandwich Islands]] and declared hostilities to be over after removing Argentina's [[Southern Thule]] garrison at the [[Corbeta Uruguay base]]. Corbeta Uruguay was established in 1976, but the Argentine base was only contested through diplomatic channels by the UK until 1982.

The war lasted 74 days, with 255 British and [[Argentine Military Cemetery|649]] Argentine soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen, and three civilian [[Falklanders]] killed.

The British Government decreed that all [[classified information]] would be available to the public in the year 2082.  However, following the [[Freedom of information in the United Kingdom|Freedom of Information Act]], a great deal of formerly classified material is now available.

The surrender document is on display at the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://london.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConMediaFile.2703 Extract from the Surrender document - IWM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112100902/http://london.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConMediaFile.2703 |date=2008-11-12 }} Retrieved 2004-03-24&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted in the museum, the time of surrender was backdated three hours in order that both [[Zulu time]] (UTC) and the local time were recorded as 14 June even though technically it was already 15 June in London, in order to prevent possible confusion by Argentine troops who might have mistakenly thought that they were permitted to keep fighting until the next day, 15 June 1982.

Relations between the UK and Argentina were not restored until 1989 and only under the '''umbrella formula''' which states that the [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|islands sovereignty dispute]] will remain aside.

14 June has been a public holiday in the Falkland Islands since 1984, officially called as "[[Liberation Day (Falkland Islands)|Liberation Day]]".

'''ArtPrize''' is an art competition and festival in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= Nancy|last= Tobin |title= West of Chelsea: A Local ArtPrize?
|url= http://maplewood.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/17/west-of-chelsea-a-local-artprize/ |work=The New York Times|date= August 17, 2009|accessdate=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone over the age of 18 can display their art, and any space within the three-square-mile ArtPrize district can be a venue. There are typically over 160 venues such as museums, galleries, bars, restaurants, hotels, public parks, bridges, laundromats, auto body shops, and more.  

ArtPrize lasts for 19 days beginning in late September, and during each festival $500,000 in cash prizes are awarded based on public voting and a jury of art experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2009/apr/23/news/chi-ap-mi-artprize-glance|title=Details about the Grand Rapids art contest|date=April 23, 2009|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; ArtPrize was originally an annual event; in 2018 it was switched to a biennial schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artprize.org/blog/artprize-gets-ready-for-next-decade|title=ArtPrize Gets Ready for its Next Decade: Introduces Project 1, Shifts to Biennial Schedule|website=www.artprize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

ArtPrize was created in 2009 by Rick DeVos, the son of Republican gubernatorial candidate [[Dick DeVos]] and United States Secretary of Education [[Betsy DeVos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artprize.org/about/rick-devos|title=Rick DeVos|website=www.artprize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DeVos family contributes approximately $560,000 annually to the ArtPrize budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artandeducation.net/news/156119/michigan-art-festival-scrutinized-for-ties-to-secretary-of-education-betsy-devos|title=Michigan Art Festival Scrutinized for Ties to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos  - News - Art &amp; Education|website=www.artandeducation.net|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the festival's connection to the DeVos family's wealth and their conservative politics was criticized by artist [[Eric Millikin]] in his “Made of Money” installation, placed within ArtPrize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/winners-to-be-announced-in-annual-michigan-art-competition|title=Winners to be announced in annual Michigan art competition|date=2017-10-06|work=National Post|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 2014, ''The Art Newspaper'' listed ArtPrize as one of the most-attended "big ticket" art events (those where visitors are often counted more than once), with ArtPrize's attendance of 440,000 being roughly one quarter of the 1.6 million who attended the Russian Imperial Costume exhibition at the [[Hermitage Museum|State Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/visitor-figures-2014-top-15-big-ticket-shows/|title=Visitor figures 2014: top 15 Big Ticket shows|last=De Silva|first=Jose|date=April 1, 2015|website=The Art Newspaper|access-date=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ArtPrize was highlighted along with [[Slows Bar BQ]] and the [[Frederik Meijer Gardens &amp; Sculpture Park]] as one of the reasons to visit Grand Rapids in ''The New York Times’'' "52 Places To Go in 2016."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/07/travel/places-to-visit.html|title=52 Places to Go in 2016|date=2016-01-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-04|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:Rob-Bliss-Plane-Drop-B-402 copy.jpg|thumb|540x540px|Thousands of ArtPrize visitors gather in Rosa Parks Circle in downtown Grand Rapids.]]
ArtPrize was conceived by Rick DeVos as an untraditional art contest with its goals being: any artist in the world could compete; anyone with property in downtown Grand Rapids could turn their space into a venue; and any visitor could vote for their favorite artwork. Event organizers would provide no selection committees or curators. And the largest cash prize in the art world would be awarded entirely by popular vote.

At the inaugural ArtPrize, held in 2009, the winners were determined solely by the public, voting from mobile devices and the ArtPrize website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/arts/design/08artprize.html|title=Eyes on the ArtPrize|date=October 7, 2009|publisher=The New York Times|access-date=September 24, 2016|author=Micheline Maynard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, ArtPrize added categories judged by art experts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.artprize.org/blog/category/jurors|title=Official ArtPrize Blog:Jurors|publisher=ArtPrize|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014 restructured the awards format&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artprize.org/blog/harder-better-faster-stronger|title=ArtPrize 2014 Updates Awards Structure|website=www.artprize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing two parallel tracks of public vote and juried awards with equal prize amounts. The updated award structure includes two Grand Prizes of $200,000, one chosen by public vote and one selected by a panel of three arts experts. An additional $100,000 in awards are given to artists in four entry categories—Two-Dimensional, Three-Dimensional, Time-Based, and Installation—as well as the Outstanding Venue Juried Award for best curatorial presentation.&lt;ref name="2015-jury-winners"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/artprize/index.ssf/2015/10/see_who_won_artprize_2015s_juried_category_awards.html|title=See who won ArtPrize 2015 juried category awards|last=Serba|first=John|date=October 9, 2015|publisher=MLive Media Group|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/artprize/index.ssf/2011/12/artprize_2012_will_introduce_new_100000_juried_grand_prize_for_fourth_exhibition_next_september.html|title=ArtPrize 2012 will introduce new $100,000 juried grand prize for fourth exhibition next September|last=Kaczmarczyk|first=Jeffrey|date=December 6, 2011|publisher=[[MLive.com]]|accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visitors must attend the annual event in person in order to vote. They can either download the ArtPrize mobile app, free for iOS and Android devices, which uses location services to determine when a visitor has stepped into the three square-mile event district—or visit an [http://www.artprize.org/visit/details#artprize-neighborhood-hubs ArtPrize HUB location] to register in person. Each artist is assigned a 5-digit vote code which is posted near their entry during the event, and available both online and in the mobile app.&lt;ref name="mrak"&gt;{{Cite news|first= Mrak |last= Stryker |title= ArtPrize: where to look and how to vote |url=http://www.freep.com/article/20090920/ENT05/90920012/1115/Ent05/ArtPrize--Where-to-look-and-how-to-vote|newspaper= [[Detroit News]]|id= |date= September 20, 2009 |accessdate=September 20, 2009 |quote= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091005014056/http://www.freep.com/article/20090920/ENT05/90920012/1115/Ent05/ArtPrize--Where-to-look-and-how-to-vote| archivedate= October 5, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
David Dodde’s ''Fleurs et riviere'' was an entry that placed magnetic flowers on the [[Alexander Calder]] sculpture ''[[La Grande Vitesse]]''. After getting complaints, the City of Grand Rapids contacted the Calder Foundation to get their input. Calder's grandson, Alexander S. C. Rower, replied: "The initiative is luckily temporary and reflects an utter lack of understanding and respect of Calder's genius." The city decided to have the flowers removed before the end of the exhibition.&lt;ref name="2013-controversy-mlive"&gt;{{Cite web|title= Calder's grandson calls ArtPrize flowers an 'abomination' |url= http://www.mlive.com/artprize/index.ssf/2013/09/calders_grandson_calls_artprize_flowers_an_abomination.html |last= Vande Bunte |first= Matt |publisher= MLive Media Group |date= September 26, 2013 |accessdate=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chateau royal collioure.jpg|thumb|right|Château Royal de Collioure]]
The '''Château Royal de Collioure''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Castell Reial de Cotlliure'') is a massive [[France|French]] royal castle in the town of [[Collioure]], a few kilometers north of the Spanish border in the French ''département'' of [[Pyrénées-Orientales]].&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502183440/http://www.cg66.fr/culture/patrimoine_catalanite/monuments/chateau_royal/index.html|title=Culture et Catalanité Histoire Monuments|date=2 May 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the Castle of Collioure ==
The Château is the juxtaposition of at least four castles.

[[Roussillon]] was conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] around 120 BC and then occupied by the [[Visigoths]] from 418.
The first mention is about a fortified site in [[Collioure]] under siege in 673, by [[Wamba, Visigothic king|Wamba]], king of the [[Visigoths]] who lay siege to the “''Castellum Caucolibéri''” to subdue a rebellion.

===Castle of the Templars===
In the 12th century, [[Girard II]], the last independent count of the [[Roussillon]], bequeathed his land to [[Alfonso II of Aragon|Alfons II]], [[King of Aragon]] and [[Count of Barcelona]]. Concerned about the prosperity of [[Collioure]], the [[kings of Aragon]] granted privileges and tax exemptions. An annual fair was established, and important works were undertaken in the castle, the port and the town.
The [[Knights Templar]] built the castle around 1207 and integrated it to the royal castle in 1345.

===Kings of Majorca===
A second castle was later built by the [[Kings of Majorca]] during the 13th and 14th centuries.
In the 13th century, the Castle was annexed to the [[Kings of Majorca|Kingdom of Majorca]], which included the domain of [[Montpellier]], the earldoms of the [[Roussillon]] and [[Cerdanya]], the [[Conflent]] and [[Vallespir]], and the [[Balearic Islands]].
The [[Kings of Majorca]] were itinerant. They travelled with their court,  moving frequently from [[Maguelonne]], near [[Montpellier]], to [[Perpignan]], to [[Palma, Majorca|Palma de Majorca]] or to [[Collioure]].

===Habsburg fortress: Charles Quint and Philip II===
In the 16th century, after a brief occupation by [[Louis XI]], the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Spanish Habsburgs]], starting with [[Charles Quint]], again occupied [[Collioure]]. He and his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] turned the castle into a modern fortress of the 16th century. It was imperative that the fortifications were adapted in line with the advances in [[artillery]], and so the castle defences and its surroundings were considerably reinforced.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

===Bourbon citadel===
In the 17th century [[Collioure]] was at stake in the wars between the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Spanish Habsburgs]] and the [[House of Bourbon|French Bourbons]]. 
In 1642, [[Louis XIII]]'s troops lay siege to [[Collioure]] and the Château Royal. Ten thousand  men including [[Turenne]], [[Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan|d'Artagnan]] and the [[Musketeers of the Guard|King's musketeers]] occupied the hills overlooking the town, while the [[History of the French Navy#Louis XIII and Richelieu|French fleet]] blocked the port. Deprived of water due to the destruction of their wells, the [[Spain|Spanish]] were forced to surrender. In 1659, [[France]] annexed the [[Roussillon]] and [[Collioure]] and the castle passed definitively into French hands. [[Vauban]] built the bastions, reinforced the structure and upgraded [[Fort Saint-Elme (France)|Fort Saint-Elme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cheminsdememoire.gouv.fr/page/affichelieu.php?idLang=fr&amp;idLieu=1511] {{dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Roussillon war===
[[Image:Dugommier.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacques François Dugommier|General Dugommier]]]]
In 1793, the [[Spain|Spanish]] again besieged and occupied [[Collioure]], which [[Jacques François Dugommier|General Dugommier]] took back the next year. He captured [[Fort Saint-Elme (France)|Fort Saint-Elme]] on 25 May and forced the Spanish general Eugenio Navarro to surrender the next day.&lt;ref name="cheminsdememoire.gouv.fr"&gt;[http://www.cheminsdememoire.gouv.fr/page/affichelieu.php?idLieu=4311&amp;idLang=en] {{dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 20th century===
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}
* [[Fort Saint-Elme (France)|Fort Saint-Elme]] was sold at auction in August 1913.
* The castle was designated an historic monument in 1922.

The castle was turned into a men's [[prison]] in March 1939 and became the first [[Internment|disciplinary camp]] for the Spanish [[refugees]] of the '''Retirada''', the exile from the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Many others were sent to the camps of [[Argelès-sur-Mer]] and [[camp de Rivesaltes|Rivesaltes]].
After 1941, French detainees were prisoners of the [[Vichy regime]]. The prison received men sentenced for indiscipline, attempted escape and incitement to rebellion from the camps of [[Argelès-sur-Mer]], [[Saint-Cyprien, Pyrénées-Orientales|Saint-Cyprien]] and [[Le Barcarès]]. The detainees transited there before being sent to [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name="cheminsdememoire.gouv.fr"/&gt;

Property of the [[General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales]] since 1951, the castle is one of the major tourist spots in [[Northern Catalonia]].&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

'''Conflict theories''' are  perspectives in [[sociology]] and [[social psychology]] that emphasize a [[Historical materialism|materialist]] interpretation of history, [[Dialectical materialism|dialectical method]] of analysis, a critical stance toward existing social arrangements, and political program of revolution or, at least, [[reform]]. Conflict theories draw attention to power differentials, such as [[class conflict]], and generally contrast historically dominant ideologies. It is therefore a [[Macrosociology|macro-level analysis of society]].

[[Karl Marx]] is the father of the [[social conflict theory]], which is a component of the four major paradigms of sociology. Certain conflict theories set out to highlight the ideological aspects inherent in traditional thought. While many of these perspectives hold parallels, conflict theory ''does not'' refer to a unified school of thought, and should not be confused with, for instance, [[peace and conflict studies]], or any other specific theory of [[social conflict]].

== In classical sociology ==
Of the classical founders of social science, conflict theory is most commonly associated with Karl Marx (1818–1883). Based on a [[dialectical materialism|dialectical materialist]] account of history, [[Marxism]] posited that [[capitalism]], like previous socioeconomic systems, would inevitably produce internal tensions leading to its own destruction. Marx ushered in radical change, advocating [[proletarian revolution]] and freedom from the [[ruling class]]es.  At the same time, Karl Marx was aware that most of the people living in capitalist societies did not see how the system shaped the entire operation of society.  Just as modern individuals see private property (and the right to pass that property on to their children) as natural, many of the members in capitalistic societies see the rich as having earned their wealth through hard work and education, while seeing the poor as lacking in skill and initiative.  Marx rejected this type of thinking and termed it ''[[false consciousness]]'', explanations of social problems as the shortcomings of individuals rather than the flaws of society.  Marx wanted to replace this kind of thinking with something [[Friedrich Engels]] termed ''[[class consciousness]]'', the workers' recognition of themselves as a class unified in opposition to capitalists and ultimately to the capitalist system itself.  In general, Marx wanted the proletarians to rise up against the capitalists and overthrow the capitalist system.

{{Quotation|The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.
Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.|[[Karl Marx]] &amp; [[Friedrich Engels]] ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' 1848|&lt;ref&gt;Marx and Engels, ''The Communist Manifesto'', introduction by Martin Malia (New York: Penguin group, 1998), pg. 35 {{ISBN|0-451-52710-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

{{Quotation|In the social productions of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or – this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms – with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces, these relations turn into their [[fetters]]. Then an era of social revolution begins. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure.

In studying such transformations it is always necessary to distinguish between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, artistic or philosophic – in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as one does not judge an individual by what he thinks about himself, so one cannot judge such a period of transformation by its consciousness, but, on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained from the contradictions of material life, from the conflict existing between the social forces of production and the relations of production. No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.

Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve, since closer examination will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the course of formation. In broad outline, the Asiatic, ancient, [a] [[feudal]] and modern [[bourgeois]] modes of production may be designated as epochs marking progress in the economic development of society. The bourgeois [[mode of production]] is the last antagonistic form of the social process of production – antagonistic not in the sense of individual antagonism but of an antagonism that emanates from the individuals' social conditions of existence – but the productive forces developing within bourgeois society create also the material conditions for a solution of this antagonism. The prehistory of human society accordingly closes with this social formation.|[[Karl Marx]] ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' 1859|&lt;ref&gt;Marx ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'', http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Two early conflict theorists were the Polish-Austrian sociologist and political theorist [[Ludwig Gumplowicz]] (1838–1909) and the American sociologist and paleontologist [[Lester F. Ward]] (1841–1913). Although Ward and Gumplowicz developed their theories independently they had much in common and approached conflict from a comprehensive anthropological and evolutionary point-of-view as opposed to Marx's rather exclusive focus on economic factors.

Gumplowicz, in ''Grundriss der Soziologie'' (''Outlines of Sociology'', 1884), describes how civilization has been shaped by [[Cultural conflict|conflict between cultures]] and [[Ethnic conflict|ethnic]] groups. Gumplowicz theorized that large complex human societies evolved from the war and conquest. The winner of a war would enslave the losers; eventually a complex [[caste system]] develops.&lt;ref&gt;Fifty Key Sociologists: the Formative Theorists, John Scott Irving, 2007, pg 59&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irving Louis Horowitz|Horowitz]] says that Gumplowicz understood conflict in all its forms: "class conflict, race conflict and ethnic conflict", and calls him one of the fathers of conflict theory.&lt;ref&gt;"Communicating Ideas: The Politics of Scholarly Publishing", Irving Louis Horowitz, 1986, pg 281&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|What happened in India, [[Babylon]], Egypt, Greece and Rome may sometime happen in modern Europe. European civilization may perish, over flooded by barbaric tribes. But if any one believes that we are safe from such catastrophes he is perhaps yielding to an all too optimistic delusion. There are no barbaric tribes in our neighbourhood to be sure — but let no one be deceived, their instincts lie latent in the populace of European states.|[[Gumplowicz]] (1884)|&lt;ref&gt;"Outlines of Sociology", pg 196&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Ward directly attacked and attempted to systematically refute the elite business class' [[laissez-faire]] philosophy as espoused by the hugely popular social philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]]. Ward's ''Dynamic Sociology'' (1883) was an extended thesis on how to reduce conflict and competition in society and thus optimize human progress. At the most basic level Ward saw human nature itself to be deeply conflicted between self-{{Wikteng|aggrandizement}} and [[altruism]], between emotion and intellect, and between male and female. These conflicts would be then reflected in society and Ward assumed there had been a "perpetual and vigorous struggle" among various "social forces" that shaped civilization.&lt;ref&gt;"Transforming Leadership",  James MacGregor Burns, 2004, pg 189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"German Realpolitik and American Sociology: an Inquiry Into the Sources and Political Significance of the Sociology of Conflict", James Alfred Aho, 1975, ch. 6 'Lester F. Ward's Sociology of Conflict'&lt;/ref&gt; Ward was more optimistic than Marx and Gumplowicz and believed that it was possible to build on and reform present social structures with the help of [[sociological analysis]].

[[Durkheim|Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) saw society as a functioning organism. Functionalism concerns "the effort to impute, as rigorously as possible, to each feature, custom, or practice, its effect on the functioning of a supposedly stable, cohesive system,"&lt;ref name="Bourricaud"&gt;Bourricaud, F. 'The Sociology of Talcott Parsons' Chicago University Press. {{ISBN|0-226-06756-4}}. p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  The chief form of [[social conflict]] that Durkheim addressed was [[crime]].  Durkheim saw crime as "a factor in public health, an integral part of all healthy societies."&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. (1938). ''The Rules of Sociological Method.'' Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Collective consciousness|collective conscience]] defines certain acts as "criminal." Crime thus plays a role in the evolution of morality and law: "[it] implies not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes."&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, (1938), pp. 70–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]]'s (1864–1920) approach to conflict is contrasted with that of Marx. While Marx focused on the way individual behaviour is conditioned by [[social structure]], Weber emphasized the importance of "[[social actions|social action]]," i.e., the ability of individuals to affect their social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Livesay, C.

[[C. Wright Mills]] has been called the founder of ''modern conflict theory''.&lt;ref name = Knapp&gt;Knapp, P. (1994). ''One World – Many Worlds: Contemporary Sociological Theory'' (2nd Ed.). Harpercollins College Div, pp.    228–246. [http://www94.homepage.villanova.edu/peter.knapp/THgreats.htm Online summary] {{ISBN|978-0-06-501218-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mills's view, social structures are created through conflict between people with differing interests and resources. Individuals and resources, in turn, are influenced by these structures and by the "unequal distribution of [[Power (politics)|power]] and resources in the society."&lt;ref name = Knapp/&gt; The [[power elite]] of American society, (i.e., the [[military–industrial complex]]) had "emerged from the fusion of the [[corporate elite]], [[the Pentagon]], and the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of government." Mills argued that the interests of this elite were opposed to those of the people. He theorized that the policies of the power elite would result in "increased escalation of conflict, production of [[weapons of mass destruction]], and possibly the annihilation of the human race."&lt;ref name = Knapp/&gt;

[[Gene Sharp]] (1928-2018) was a professor emeritus of political science at the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12522848 | work=BBC News | title=Gene Sharp: Author of the nonviolent revolution rulebook | date=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his extensive writings on [[Nonviolent resistance|nonviolent struggle]], which have influenced numerous anti-government resistance movements around the world. In 1983 he founded the [[Albert Einstein Institution]], a non-profit organization devoted to studies and promotion of the use of nonviolent action in conflicts worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations9173.html Gene Sharp biography at Albert Einstein Institution web site.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112012144/http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations9173.html |date=12 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp's key theme is that power is not monolithic; that is, it does not derive from some intrinsic quality of those who are in power. For Sharp, political power, the power of any state—regardless of its particular structural organization—ultimately derives from the subjects of the state. His fundamental belief is that any power structure relies upon the subjects' obedience to the orders of the ruler or rulers. If subjects do not obey, leaders have no power. Sharp has been called both the "Machiavelli of nonviolence" and the "Clausewitz of nonviolent warfare."&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Thomas.  ''Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor.''  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2004{{page needed|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp's scholarship has influenced resistance organizations around the world. Most recently the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|protest movement]] that toppled President [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]] of Egypt drew extensively on his ideas, as well as the [[Tunisian revolution|youth movement in Tunisia]] and the earlier ones in the Eastern European [[colour revolution]]s that had previously been inspired by Sharp's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/world/middleeast/17sharp.html?_r=1&amp;hp | work=The New York Times | title=Shy U.S. Intellectual Created Playbook Used in a Revolution | date=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent articulation of conflict theory is found in Canadian sociologist Alan Sears' book ''A Good Book, in Theory: A Guide to Theoretical Thinking'' (2008):&lt;ref&gt;Sears, Alan. (2008) ''A Good Book, In Theory: A Guide to Theoretical Thinking.'' North York: Higher Education University of Toronto Press, pg. 34-6, {{ISBN|1-55111-536-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Societies are defined by inequality that produces conflict, rather than which produces order and consensus. This conflict based on inequality can only be overcome through a fundamental transformation of the existing relations in the society, and is productive of new social relations.
* The disadvantaged have structural interests that run counter to the [[status quo]], which, once they are assumed, will lead to social change. Thus, they are viewed as agents of change rather than objects one should feel sympathy for.
* Human potential (e.g., capacity for creativity) is suppressed by conditions of exploitation and oppression, which are necessary in any society with an unequal division of labour. These and other qualities do not necessarily have to be stunted due to the requirements of the so-called "[[socialization|civilizing process]]," or "[[Davis-Moore hypothesis|functional necessity]]": creativity is actually an engine for economic development and change.
* The role of theory is in realizing human potential and transforming society, rather than maintaining the power structure. The opposite aim of theory would be the objectivity and detachment associated with [[positivism]], where theory is a neutral, explanatory tool.
* Consensus is a euphemism for [[ideology]]. Genuine consensus is not achieved, rather the more powerful in societies are able to impose their conceptions on others and have them accept their [[discourse]]s. Consensus does not preserve social order, it entrenches stratification, a tool of the current social order.
* The [[State (polity)|State]] serves the particular interests of the most powerful while claiming to represent the interests of all. Representation of disadvantaged groups in State processes may cultivate the notion of full participation, but this is an illusion/ideology.
* Inequality on a global level is characterized by the purposeful [[underdevelopment]] of [[Third World]] countries, both during colonization and after national independence. The global system (i.e., development agencies such as [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]]) benefits the most powerful countries and multi-national corporations, rather than the subjects of development, through economic, political, and military actions.

Although Sears associates the conflict theory approach with [[Marxism]], he argues that it is the foundation for much "[[feminist]], [[post-modernist]], [[anti-racist]], and [[gay liberation|lesbian-gay liberationist]] theories."&lt;ref&gt;Sears, pg. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Conflict theory is most commonly associated with Marxism, but as a reaction to [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] and the [[positivist]] method, it may also be associated with a number of other perspectives, including:
* [[Critical theory]]
* [[Feminist theory]]:  An approach that recognizes women's political, social, and economic equality to men. 
* [[Postmodernism|Postmodern theory]]: An approach that is critical of modernism, with a mistrust of grand theories and ideologies.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"&gt;Macionis, J., and Gerber, L. (2010). Sociology, 7th edition&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Post-structuralism|Post-structural theory]]
* [[Postcolonial theory]]
* [[Queer theory]]: A growing body of research findings that challenges the heterosexual bias in Western society.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;
* [[World-systems approach|World systems theory]]
* [[Critical race theory|Race-Conflict Approach]]: A point of view that focuses on inequality and conflict between people of different racial and ethnic categories.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;

{{Spanish name|Delgado|Gómez}}
'''Cristóbal Delgado Gómez''' (December 23, 1926 - December 30, 2006) was a Spanish historian, musician, and author. He was considered the leading expert on [[Algeciras]], having written many books about the city and being employed as the city's official historian. He worked as an officer of the Central Government from 1943 until 1990.

==Biography==
Delgado Gómez was born in Algeciras in 1926. As a young man, he taught piano and music theory at several schools in his city.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado Gómez, Cristóbal (2004). Memorias de un algecireño. FMC José Luis Cano, pp. 90, 98, 194.&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as an assistant professor in modeling at the [[Algeciras School of Arts and Crafts]].&lt;ref&gt;Delgado Gómez (2004), p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; From a young age, he was interested in local history and participated in numerous municipal projects. In 1962, he became the city's official chronicler, and a year later, he became director of the town library after the death of Juan Pérez Arriete, who held both positions until 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado Gómez, Cristóbal (2003). Algeciras en Blanco y Negro. Fundación Municipal de Cultura José Luis Cano. p. 273. {{ISBN|84-605-1829-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the director of the local library, Delgado Gómez conducted a thorough modernization of the entity which was created in 1925 by another chronicler of Algeciras, Manuel Pérez-Petinto. Delgado Gómez was the responsible for the construction of a new library headquarters in 1966 to replace an earlier one which was housed in the Algeciras Building Society.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado Gómez (2003), p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; His career also included the position of Delegate of Culture in the municipality since 1963; from 1966 through 1970, he was the city's first deputy mayor.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado Gómez (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, he published his first book ''Algeciras, past and present of the city of the beautiful bay''. Subsequently, he devoted much of his time to historical research. He lectured throughout the Spanish territory at conferences and wrote a dozen books on the history of the city and its local institutions. He became a member of the Institute of Campo de Gibraltar in 1970, a member of the Institute of Gaditanos in 1970, and a favorite son of the city on January 23, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado Gómez (2004), p. 148, 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Until he died, in 2006, he continued to participate in the city's local events, sharing his knowledge in newspapers and on the radio.&lt;ref&gt;Diario SUR (ed.): «Fallece a los 80 años Cristóbal Delgado, cronista oficial de la ciudad». Consultado el 26 de diciembre de 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Erdmann was born in [[Bergen]], Norway. He started his career as a conservator in Viborg Cathedral in Denmark where he trained under [[Oscar Matthiesen]] (1861- 1957) in [[Copenhagen]] during 1896. Erdmann followed Matthiesen to [[Berlin]] and [[Munich]] and also visited France and Italy. This was where he learned fresco techniques, decorative painting, and church restoration. After he returned to Norway in 1903, he worked together with [[Eilif Peterssen]] on decorating [[Ullern Church (Oslo)|Ullern Church]] in [[Oslo]]. Erdmann studied church restoration in Denmark in 1912, and was made a conservation adviser in 1919. He also worked as a decorator and designer with [[Arnstein Arneberg]]. He performed design work for [[O. Mustad &amp; Søn]] in Kristiania (now Oslo) from 1916 to 1921. 
From 1912,  he received an assignment from the [[Fortidsminneforeningen]] for the investigation and restoration of historic Norwegian church interiors.

'''Dumbo the Flying Elephant''' is an aerial [[carousel]]-style ride located in [[Fantasyland]] at six Disney parks around the world. It is based on the 1941 film, ''[[Dumbo]]''. The original attraction opened at [[Disneyland]] in October 1955, three months after the park opened. The four other versions of the attraction were opening-day attractions at their respective parks.

One elephant from the ride is in the collection of the [[Smithsonian]] [[National Museum of American History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], donated in 2005, on the occasion of Disneyland's 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landmark Object: Dumbo the Flying Elephant |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/news/factsheet.cfm?key=30&amp;newskey=712 |work=National Museum of American History |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=July 18, 2011 |location=Washington DC |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630185112/http://www.americanhistory.si.edu/news/factsheet.cfm?key=30&amp;newskey=712 |archivedate=June 30, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attraction==
Based on the character from the [[Dumbo|1941 animated feature]], the 16 ride vehicles each resemble Dumbo, and are mounted on articulated armatures connected to a rotating hub. The passengers ride in the "Dumbos" and can maneuver them up and down with a [[joystick]] that operates a hydraulic ram. The ride itself rotates counterclockwise at a constant rate.

A figure of Timothy Q. Mouse, currently voiced by [[Chris Edgerly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7XbceE2LTY|title=Full Voices of the Disney Theme Parks presentation from D23 Expo 2011|date=August 27, 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; rides atop the central hub. Originally at Disneyland and Magic Kingdom, the figure held a training whip and stood on a disco ball. With the exception of [[Tokyo Disneyland]], he currently stands on a hot air balloon and holds the "magic feather". Starting in 2012, Magic Kingdom's Timothy currently spins with his magic feather on top of the attraction's marquee.

Each of the parks, with the exception of [[Disneyland Paris]], has an extra Dumbo vehicle located outside of the attraction to be used by guests for better photo opportunities. [[Tokyo Disneyland]]'s photo spot differs from its three counterparts; the character is shown in his regular outfit from the original film, with a pink saddle blanket and Timothy Mouse in his hat.

All of the Dumbos, with the exception of the newer Dumbo in Walt Disney World (which was added with the [[New Fantasyland]] expansion), spin counterclockwise. The newer Dumbo in Walt Disney World spins clockwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bevil|first1=Dewayne|title=Dumbo-struck: 'New' ride soars at Disney World|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-06-28/news/os-dewayne-bevil-disney-dumbo-20120628_1_dumbo-flying-elephant-fantasyland-expansion|website=orlandosentinel.com|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}

===Disneyland===
The original design of the attraction had 10 ride vehicles which were intended to represent not the "one and only" Dumbo, but the alcohol-induced "pink elephants" scene from the film. In fact, the working title of the attraction was "[[Pink Elephants on Parade|10 Pink Elephants On Parade]]" and the elephants were painted pink{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} on installation. [[Walt Disney]] objected, not wishing Disneyland's guests to ride vehicles themed to a [[hallucination]] and thereby ordered them painted grey.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The ride was scheduled to be one of Disneyland's opening-day attractions, but instead opened a month after the park's grand opening, due to the fiberglass prototypes weighing 700 pounds.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} For the first two years, the hub of the original Dumbo ride lacked the disco ball with the Timothy Mouse figure. Also, the original Dumbos has hinged ears that were supposed to flap, but failed, due to a number of mechanical problems.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} So, the ears remained stationary until the mid-1960s, when new Dumbos were given casts with no hinges for movement. The attraction was given another slightly "newer" modification around 1978.

During his 1957 visit to Disneyland, former United States President [[Harry S. Truman]] politely declined a ride on Dumbo the Flying Elephant, due to the elephant being a Republican symbol.

During the 1970s, the attraction was planned to be expanded and renamed "Dumbo's Circusland" and was displayed in "Disneyland Presents a Preview of Coming Attractions", but was cancelled.

In 1983, as part of Fantasyland's major remodeling, the ride was moved to where Skull Rock used to be, allowing Dumbo's original location to be a shortcut to Frontierland. It was completely rebuilt with a kinetic toymaker-like design, although ten elephants were still used and Timothy still held the whip. In a featurette of the ride, as shown on the DVD release of the film's 70th anniversary, the head Disney imagineer, [[Tony Baxter (imagineer)|Tony Baxter]], even noted that the new ride looked like one of [[Mister Geppetto|Gepetto]]'s inventions.

In 1990, the attraction was updated with the 16 rainbow-colored vehicles (and Timothy's magic feather) originally intended for installation at [[Disneyland Paris]], after an incident during which a bracket support broke.

During the 1992 [[Disneyana]] convention, one of the original ride vehicles sold for US$16,000. Like other remaining 1955 attractions, one of Disneyland's Dumbos was painted gold in honor of the park's [[Happiest Homecoming on Earth|50th anniversary]] in 2005. During that same time, Timothy's magic feather was replaced by the whip. {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

The installation at Disneyland was manufactured by [[Arrow Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurr|first=Bob|title=DESIGN: Those Were The Times – No.23 1955 Arrow Development – Ed Morgan and Karl Bacon|url=http://micechat.com/49581-bob-gurr-arrow-development/|publisher=MiceChat|accessdate=28 November 2013|date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Disneyland, a ''circa'' 1915 [[band organ]] occasionally provides background music for the attraction. This powerful instrument can be heard more than a mile away, so it is rarely played.

In 2018, the queue of the ride was expanded and is now covered with new shade structures. Also riders are now assigned to specific Dumbo elephants. The queue is now completely wheelchair accessible. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vincent-Phoenix|first=Adrienne|title=Disneyland Resort Update for April 30 - May 6, 2018|url=http://www.mouseplanet.com/12089/Disneyland_Resort_Update_for_April_30_May_6_2018|publisher=MousePlanet|accessdate=30 April 2018|date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magic Kingdom===
[[File:Dumbo MK.jpg|right|thumb|Dumbo the Flying Elephant at Magic Kingdom, before the new Fantasyland expansion]]

[[Magic Kingdom]]'s original 1971 version of this attraction was designed differently from its 1955 Disneyland counterpart. On opening day, it soft-opened without not only Timothy and his disco ball, but the elephants' hats also. The hats and disco ball were eventually added after a few months, but the Timothy Mouse figure was not added for about two years.

The ride was later updated with the 16 vehicles and the new ride mechanism in 1993. However, it does not include a central water feature like its Disneyland, [[Disneyland Paris]], and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] counterparts; the [[utilidor]]s running directly below the attraction prevented the installation of water pipes necessary for the water features to operate. Also for this version, as well as its Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland counterparts, Timothy's hot air balloon had red and white stripes, rather than rainbow stripes for the Disneyland version. In 1997, the attraction's queue was covered to provide shade and decorated with topiaries.

For nostalgic visitors, a replica of Magic Kingdom's 1971 version currently exists at Tokyo Disneyland, being the only park to still feature 10 flying elephants and Timothy spinning on a disco ball. It is also the only other park, aside from Disneyland, to have Timothy holding a whip.

Magic Kingdom's Fantasyland  underwent a large expansion and renovation that began in 2011. The [[new Fantasyland]] was constructed in phases with the first half of the storybook circus open by mid-2012; a section dedicated to ''[[The Little Mermaid (franchise)|The Little Mermaid]]'', a section dedicated to ''[[Beauty and the Beast (franchise)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', and the second half of storybook circus were opened by December 6, 2012, some additional attractions opened in 2013, and the final phase was the opening of the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, which soft-opened in mid-May 2014, and officially opened on May 28.
Some elements of Mickey's Toontown Fair were demolished and others were rethemed to a new Storybook Circus area. An expanded Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride was built in this new location with an interactive queue.

Storybook Circus began soft openings on March 12, 2012, including one of the new Dumbo carousels. The southern end of Storybook Circus had a delayed opening on March 21, 2012. During the soft openings, it was revealed that the new attraction received the water features that have been included with the attraction in many other Disney Parks around the world. However, unlike the other versions, an additional effect occurs at night when the fountain lights change colors, an effect that was picked up from the Disneyland version, but with more colors. The Dumbo vehicles, which are richly detailed and vibrantly colored, now spin clockwise from the original version, which was reconstructed next to the new one, that soft-opened on June 22. The two rides therefore rotate counter to each other. The attraction also features a new soundtrack and artwork panels at the bottom of the carousels that tell the story of Dumbo, like the [[Prince Charming Regal Carrousel]] attraction. However, a new central hub was introduced that lacks the hot air balloon with Timothy Mouse and the magic feather. This figure has been moved above the attraction's marquee. A signature feature of this version is an indoor queue themed to the Bigtop from the film. Inside guests receive ticket-themed pagers where they can wait until prompted, and small children can play in the [[play area]] themed to Dumbo's fire rescue stunt scene.

===Shanghai Disneyland===
Unlike the other Disney parks, this installment of the ride is the only version that is not placed at the park's Fantasyland. Instead, it is placed at the Gardens Of Imagination.

{{Campaignbox Sudan internal conflicts}}
The '''First Sudanese Civil War''' (also known as the '''[[Anyanya]] Rebellion''' or '''Anyanya I''', after the name of the rebels, a term in the [[Ma'di language|Madi]] language which means 'snake venom')&lt;ref&gt;Matthew LeRiche, Matthew Arnold. South Sudan: from revolution to independence. 2012. Columbia University Press. New York. p. 16. {{ISBN|978-0-231-70414-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a conflict from 1955 to 1972 between the northern part of [[Sudan]] and the [[Southern Sudan|southern Sudan region]] that demanded representation and more regional autonomy. Half a million people died over the 17 years of war, which may be divided into three stages: initial guerrilla war, [[Anyanya]], and [[South Sudan Liberation Movement]].

However, the agreement that ended the First Sudanese Civil War's fighting in 1972 failed to completely dispel the tensions that had originally caused it, leading to a reigniting of the north-south conflict during the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], which lasted from 1983 to 2005. The period between 1955 and 2005 is thus sometimes considered to be a single conflict with an eleven-year ceasefire that separates two violent phases.

==Origins==
Until 1946, the [[British government]], in collaboration with the [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egyptian]] government (under a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] governing arrangement) administered south Sudan and north Sudan as separate regions. At this time, the two areas were merged into a single administrative region as part of British strategy in the Middle East.

This act was taken without consultation with southern leaders, who feared being subsumed by the political power of the larger north. Southern Sudan is inhabited primarily by [[Christians]] and [[traditional African religions]] ([http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sub/nuer.html Nuer Religion], [[Dinka religion|Dinka Religion)]] and considers itself culturally [[sub-Saharan]], while most of the north is inhabited by [[Muslims]] who were culturally [[Cushitic|Kushitic]].

After the February 1953 agreement by the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] to grant independence to Sudan, the internal tensions over the nature of the relationship of north to south were heightened. Matters reached a head as the 1 January 1956 independence day approached, as it appeared that northern leaders were backing away from commitments to create a [[federalism|federal]] government that would give the south substantial autonomy.

==War==
On 18 August 1955, members of the British-administered [[Sudan Defence Force]] Equatorial Corps [[mutiny|mutinied]] in [[Torit]], and in the following days in [[Juba, Southern Sudan|Juba]], [[Yei, Sudan|Yei]], and [[Maridi]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgar O'Ballance, ''The Secret War in the Sudan: 1955–1972'', [[Faber and Faber]], 1977, {{ISBN|0-571-10768-0}}, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate causes of the mutiny were a trial of a southern member of the national assembly and an allegedly false telegram urging northern administrators in the South to oppress Southerners.&lt;ref&gt;O'Ballance, 1977, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; The mutinies were suppressed, though survivors fled the towns and began an uncoordinated [[insurgency]] in rural areas. Poorly armed and ill-organized, they were little threat to the outgoing colonial power or the [[History of Sudan (1956–69)|newly formed Sudanese government]]. O'Ballance, writing in 1977, says that the 'period from 1955 to 1963 was simply one of guerilla survival, scarcely removed from banditry, and that it was successful due to a score or so of former southern army officers and warrant officers, and a small number of non-commissioned officers.'&lt;ref&gt;O'Ballance, 1977, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the insurgents gradually developed into a secessionist movement composed of the 1955 mutineers and southern students. These groups formed the ''[[Anyanya]]'' guerrilla army. (Anyanya is also known as ''Anyanya 1'' in comparison to [[Second Sudanese Civil War|Anyanya 2]], which began with the 1974 mutiny of the military garrison in [[Akobo, Sudan|Akobo]].) Starting from [[Equatoria]], between 1963 and 1969 Anyanya spread throughout the other two southern provinces: [[Upper Nile, Sudan|Upper Nile]] and [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr al Ghazal]]. However, the separatist movement was crippled by internal ethnic divisions. O'Ballance writes that one of the [[Sudanese army]]'s four infantry brigades had been stationed in [[Equatoria Province]] since 1955, being periodically reinforced as required.&lt;ref&gt;O'Ballance, 1977, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

The government was unable to take advantage of rebel weaknesses because of their own factionalism and instability. The first independent government of Sudan, led by Prime Minister [[Ismail al-Azhari]], was quickly replaced by a stalemated coalition of various conservative forces, which was in turn overthrown in the coup d'état of Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. [[Ibrahim Abboud]] in 1958. Resentment at the military government led to a wave of popular protests that led to the creation of an interim government in October 1964.

These protests were the first appearance of [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Hassan Al-Turabi|Hassan al-Turabi]], who was then a student leader. Between 1966 and 1969, a series of Islamist-dominated administrations proved unable to deal with the variety of ethnic, economic and conflict problems afflicting the country. After a [[1969 Sudanese coup d'état|second military coup on 25 May 1969]], Col. [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] became Prime Minister&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Political Leaders of the Contemporary Middle East and North Africa: A Biographical Dictionary|author=Bernard Reich|year=1990|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=398|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3D5FulN2WqQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780313262135}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promptly outlawed political parties.

In-fighting between [[Marxism|Marxist]] and non-Marxist factions in the ruling military class led to [[1971 Sudanese coup d'état|another coup in July 1971]] and a short-lived administration by the [[Sudanese Communist Party]] before anti-Communist factions put Nimeiry back in control of the country. That same year, German national [[Rolf Steiner]], who had been clandestinely advising the rebels, was captured in Kampala, Uganda and deported to Khartoum, where he was put on trial for his anti-government activities. Originally sentenced to death, he would serve three years in prison before being released following pressure from the [[West German]] Government.

The South was first led by the late leader [[Aggrey Jaden]]; he left the movement in 1969 due to internal political disputes. In the same year [[Gordon Muortat Mayen]] was elected unanimously as the new leader of the South. Southern Sudan in this time changed their name to the Nile Republic and resumed warfare against Khartoum, however some of the former leader Jaden's troops would not accept a Dinka leader and fought against the Anyanya. In 1971, former army lieutenant [[Joseph Lagu]] formed a successful coup d'état against Gordon Muortat with help from Israel, which pledged him their support. He then gathered all the guerilla bands under his [[South Sudan Liberation Movement|Southern Sudan Liberation Movement]] (SSLM). This was the first time in the history of the war that the separatist movement had a unified command structure to fulfill the objectives of secession and the formation of an independent state in South Sudan. It was also the first organization that could claim to speak for, and negotiate on behalf of, the entire south. Mediation between the [[World Council of Churches]] (WCC) and the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]] (AACC), both of which spent years building up trust with the two combatants, eventually led to the [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]] of March 1972 ending the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Civilians to Soldiers and from Soldiers to Civilians: Mobilization and Demobilization in Sudan|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d33CuhKeiFAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Saskia Baas|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789089643964|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for ending their armed uprising, southerners were granted a single southern administrative region with various defined powers. However, this agreement was denounced as a sellout by former leaders [[Aggrey Jaden]] and [[Gordon Muortat Mayen]]. The agreement's demise was predicted by both, with Muortat going on to form and lead the African National Front, an opposition movement against the Addis Ababa talks and agreement, and also in 1975, the Anyanya Patriotic Front &amp;mdash; a new liberation movement with the same aims as SSPG, NPG and the first Anyanya &amp;mdash; to liberate the South as a separate country from the North. The civil war was finally restarted, this time under [[John Garang]].

==Effects==
Five hundred thousand people, of whom only one in five was considered an armed combatant, were killed in the seventeen years of war, and hundreds of thousands more were [[forced migration|forced to leave]] their homes. The Addis Ababa Agreement proved to be only temporary respite. Infringements by the north led to increased unrest in the south starting in the mid-1970s, leading to the 1983 army mutiny that sparked the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], a conflict that lasted for almost 22 years and led to the independence of [[South Sudan]].

'''Georgios Tertsetis''' ({{lang-el|Γεώργιος Τερτσέτης}} 1800, [[Zakynthos]] – 15 April 1874, [[Athens]]) was a Greek [[Greek War of Independence|independence fighter]], historian, politician, poet, writer, judge and philosopher. He is best known, along with [[Anastasios Polyzoidis]], for his refusal to agree to the condemnation and execution of [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] and [[Dimitrios Plapoutas]], in 1832.

==Biography==
Tertsetis was born in Zakynthos but studied law at the [[University of Padua]]. Soon he became interested in Italian literature and the European Enlightenment. When the Greek Revolution broke out in 1821, Tertsetis returned to Zakynthos fired up with patriotic fever and took part is some battled in Peloponnese. As he was under great financial difficulties, he worked as a tutor to the Botsaris family in Patras. He was able to find some work in Nafplion where he was given the post of History Professor at the Military Academy.

In 1833, Tertsetis was appointed a magistrate. His is mostly known in Greece as one of the three judges who refused to succumb to government pressure and condemn Theodoros Kolokotronis to death, a brave act that though put him to exile. The passion of Georgios Tertsetis was literature. He wrote many verses and in 1833, he published a poem dedicated to King Otto, entitled The Kiss, a poem inspired by the folklore language of the common people. However, his poetry didn't have much popularity and remains unknown. It was his prose that was much appreciated. The most famous work of Tertsetis was The Memoirs of Kolokotronis, a narrative biography of the great hero of the Greek Revolution. Georgios Tertsetis died in Athens in 1874.

{{literature}}

The term '''''hamartia''''' derives from the Greek ἁμαρτία, from ἁμαρτάνειν ''hamartánein'', which means "to miss the mark" or "to err".&lt;ref&gt;"Hamartia". ''Merriam-Webster.com''. Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web. 28 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamartia: (Ancient Greek: ἁμαρτία) Error of Judgement or Tragic Flaw. "Hamartia". ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2014. Web. 28 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is most often associated with [[Greek tragedy]], although it is also used in [[Christian theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Eugene J. "Sarx and Sin in Pauline Theology" ''Laval théologique et philosophique''. 29.3 (1973) 243–255. Web. Érudit. 1 Nov 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Hamartia'' as it pertains to [[Play (theatre)|dramatic literature]] was first used by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. In [[tragedy]], ''hamartia'' is commonly understood to refer to the [[protagonist|protagonist’s]] error or '''tragic flaw''' that leads to a chain of plot actions culminating in a reversal of their good fortune to bad.  

What qualifies as the error or flaw can include an error resulting from ignorance, an error of judgement, a flaw in character, or a [[wrongdoing]]. The spectrum of meanings has invited debate among critics and scholars and different interpretations among dramatists.

== In Aristotle's ''Poetics'' ==
[[File:6Parts Image.pdf|thumb|A list of 
the six parts of Aristotle's Greek tragedy]]
[[File:Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure.pdf|thumb|"Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure"—click to view a larger version]]
Hamartia is first described in the subject of literary criticism by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. The source of ''hamartia'' is at the juncture between character and the character's actions or behaviors as described by [[Aristotle]].

{{quote|Character in a play is that which reveals the moral purpose of the agents, i.e. the sort of thing they seek or avoid.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. "Poetics". Trans. Ingram Bywater. The Project Gutenberg EBook. Oxford: Clarendon P, 2 May 2009. Web. 26 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his introduction to the S. H. Butcher translation of ''Poetics'', [[Francis Fergusson]] describes ''hamartia'' as the inner quality that initiates, as in [[Dante|Dante's]] words, a "movement of spirit" within the protagonist to commit actions which drive the plot towards its tragic end, inspiring in the audience a build of pity and fear that leads to a purgation of those emotions, or [[catharsis]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergusson 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/poetics.htmlThe Internet Classics Archive] by Daniel C. Stevenson, Web Atomics. Web. 11 Dec. 2014.  &lt;/ref&gt;

Jules Brody, however, argues that "it is the height of [[irony]] that the idea of the tragic flaw should have had its origin in the Aristotelian notion of ''hamartia''.  Whatever this problematic word may be taken to mean, it has nothing to do with such ideas as fault, vice, guilt, [[Immoral|moral deficiency]], or the like.  ''Hamartia'' is a morally neutral non-[[normative]] term, derived from the verb ''hamartano'', meaning 'to miss the mark', 'to fall short of an objective'.  And by extension: to reach one destination rather than the intended one; to make a mistake, not in the sense of a moral failure, but in the nonjudgmental sense of taking one thing for another, taking something for its opposite.  ''Hamartia'' may betoken an error of discernment due to ignorance, to the lack of an essential piece of information.  Finally, ''hamartia'' may be viewed simply as an act which, for whatever reason, ends in failure rather than success."&lt;ref&gt;Jules Brody, "Fate, Philology, Freud," ''Philosophy and Literature'' 38.1 (April 2014): 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Greek tragedy]], for a story to be "of adequate magnitude" it involves characters of high rank, [[reputation |prestige]], or good fortune. If the protagonist is too worthy of esteem, or too wicked, his/her change of fortune will not evoke the ideal proportion of pity and fear necessary for catharsis. Here Aristotle describes ''hamartia'' as the quality of a [[tragic hero]] that generates that optimal balance.

{{quote|...the character between these two extremes&amp;nbsp;– that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error or frailty.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. "Poetics". Trans. Ingram Bywater. The Project Gutenberg EBook. Oxford: Clarendon P, 2 May 2009. Web. 26 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In Christian theology ==
{{Main |Hamartiology}}
''Hamartia'' is also used in Christian theology because of its use in the [[Septuagint]] and [[New Testament]]. The Hebrew (''chatá'') and its Greek equivalent (''àµaρtίa''/''hamartia'') both mean "missing the mark" or "off the mark".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.blbclassic.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H2398&amp;t=KJV Strong's]'', bibclassic.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=G266 Strong's]'', blueletterbible.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/miss+the+mark Legal Dictionary]'', thefreedictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are four basic usages for ''hamartia'': 
# ''Hamartia'' is sometimes used to mean acts of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] "by omission or commission in thought and feeling or in speech and actions" as in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 5:12, "all have sinned".&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, J. H. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1E4VAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Thayer++Greek-English&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EsAdVdiLBM6uogSsn4LADw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Thayer%20%20Greek-English&amp;f=false Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament]'' (Harper, 1887), s.v. ?µa?t?a online at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Hamartia'' is sometimes applied to the [[fall of man]] from original righteousness that resulted in humanity's innate propensity for sin, that is [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Eugene "Sarx and Sin in Pauline Theology" in ''Laval théologique et philosophique.'' 29.3 (1973) 243-255. Web. Érudit. 1 Nov 2014 and&lt;br/&gt;Thayer, J. H. ''Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament'' (Harper, 1887), s.v. ?µa?t?a online at https://books.google.com/books?id=1E4VAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Thayer++Greek-English&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EsAdVdiLBM6uogSsn4LADw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Thayer%20%20Greek-English&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; For example, as in Romans 3:9, everyone is "under the power of sin".&lt;ref&gt;http://biblehub.com/romans/3-9.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
# A third application concerns the "weakness of the flesh" and the free will to resist sinful acts. "The original inclination to sin in mankind comes from ''the weakness of the flesh''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Stillingfleet]], ''Fifty Sermons Preached upon Several Occasions'' (J. Heptinstall for Henry Mortlock, 1707), 525. Online at https://books.google.com/books?id=kSVWAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22weakness+of+the+flesh%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s &lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Hamartia'' is sometimes "personified".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey W. Bromiley, ''Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in One Volume'' (Eerdmans, 1985), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Romans 6:20 speaks of being enslaved to ''hamartia'' (sin).

== Tragic flaw, tragic error, and divine intervention ==
[[Aristotle]] mentions ''hamartia'' in ''Poetics''. He argues that it is a powerful device to have a story begin with a rich and powerful hero, neither exceptionally virtuous nor villainous, who then falls into misfortune by a mistake or error (''hamartia''). Discussion among scholars centers mainly on the degree to which hamartia is defined as ''tragic flaw'' or ''tragic error''.

===Critical argument for flaw===
[[Poetic justice]] describes an obligation of the dramatic poet, along with philosophers and priests, to see that their work promotes moral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Burnley Jones and Nicol, 125&lt;/ref&gt; 18th-century French dramatic style honored that obligation with the use of ''hamartia'' as a vice to be punished&lt;ref&gt;Burnley Jones and Nicol,12,125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Rymer. (2014). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/514581/Thomas-Rymer&lt;/ref&gt; ''Phèdre'', Racine's adaptation of Euripides' ''Hippolytus'', is an example of French Neoclassical use of ''hamartia'' as a means of punishing vice.&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, B. ''The Wadsworth Anthology of Drama'' 5th ed. 444-463. Boston: Thomson Wadsworth. 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racine, Jean. ''Phèdre'', Harvard Classics, Vol. 26, Part 3. Web. 11 Dec. 2014. http://www.bartleby.com/26/3/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Racine]] says in his Preface to ''Phèdre'', as translated by R.C. Knight:

{{quote|The failings of love are treated as real failings. The passions are offered to view only to show all the ravage they create. And vice is everywhere painted in such hues, that its hideous face may be recognized and loathed.&lt;ref&gt;Worthen,446&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The play is a tragic story about a [[royal family]]. The main characters' respective vices—rage, lust and envy—lead them to their tragic downfall.&lt;ref&gt;Euripedes. ''Hippolytus'', Harvard Classics, 8.7. Web. 8 Dec. 2014. http://www.bartleby.com/8/7/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical argument for error===
In her 1963 ''[[Modern Language Review]]'' article, ''The Tragic Flaw: Is it a Tragic Error?'', Isabel Hyde traces the twentieth-century history of ''hamartia'' as tragic flaw, which she argues is an incorrect interpretation. Hyde draws upon the language in Butcher's interpretation of ''Poetics'' regarding ''hamartia'' as both error and "defect in character". Hyde points out a footnote in which Butcher qualifies his second definition by saying it is not a "natural" expression to describe a flaw in behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Butcher, Samuel H., Aristotle’s Theory of Poetry and Fine Art, New York 41911&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde calls upon another description from A.C. Bradley's ''Shakespearean Tragedy'' of 1904 which she contends is misleading:

{{quote|...the comparatively innocent hero still shows some marked imperfection or defect, irresolution, precipitancy, pride, credulousness, excessive simplicity, excessive susceptibility to sexual emotion and the like...his weakness or defect is so intertwined with everything that is admirable in him...&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, A. C. 1851-1935. Shakespearean Tragedy: Lectures On Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth. London: Macmillan and co., limited, 1904. Web, 13 Dec. 2014. http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x000240890;view=1up;seq=1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hyde goes on to elucidate interpretive pitfalls of treating ''hamartia'' as tragic flaw by tracing the tragic flaw argument through several examples from well-known tragedies including ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Oedipus the King]]''. 

Hyde observes that students often state "thinking too much" as Hamlet's tragic flaw upon which his death in the story depends. That idea does not, however, offer explanation for the moments when Hamlet does act impulsively and violently. It also embarks down a trail of logic that suggests he ought to have murdered Claudius right away to avoid tragedy, which Hyde asserts is problematic. 

In ''[[Oedipus the King]],'' she observes that the ideas of Oedipus' hasty behavior at the crossroads or his trust in his intellect as being the qualities upon which the change of fortune relies is incomplete. Instead, to focus on his ignorance of the true identity of his parents as the foundation of his downfall takes into account all of his decisions that lead to the tragic end. Rather than a flaw in character, error, in Oedipus' case based upon lack of information, is the more complete interpretation.   
 
In his 1978 ''[[Classical World (journal)|Classical World]]'' article ''Hamartia, Atë, and Oedipus'', Leon Golden compares scholarship that examines where to place ''hamartia's'' definition along a spectrum connecting the moral, flaw, and the intellectual, error. His goal is to revisit the role, if any, [[Atë]], or divine intervention, plays in ''hamartia''.  The Butcher translation of "Poetics" references ''hamartia'' as both a "single great error", and "a single great defect in character", prompting critics to raise arguments. 

Mid-twentieth-century scholar Phillip W. Harsh sees ''hamartia'' as tragic flaw, observing that Oedipus assumes some moral ownership of his demise when he reacts excessively with rage and murder to the encounter at the crossroads.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, Leon. "Hamartia, Ate, and Oedipus". ''The Classical World'', 72.1 (Sep., 1978), 3-12. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP. Web. 7 Dec. 2014. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4348969&lt;/ref&gt; Van Braam, on the other hand, notes of Oedipus' ''hamartia'', "no specific sin attaching to him as an individual, but the universally human one of blindly following the light of one's own intellect."&lt;ref&gt;P. van Braam, "Aristotle's Use of Ἁμαρτία" ''The Classical Quarterly'', 6.4 (Oct., 1912), 266-272. London: Cambridge UP. Web. 7 Dec. 2014. https://www.jstor.org/stable/635946&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that a defining feature of tragedy is that the sufferer must be the agent of his own suffering by no conscious moral failing on his part in order to create a tragic irony. 

O. Hey's observations fall into this camp as well. He notes that the term refers to an action that is carried out in good moral faith by the protagonist, but as he has been deprived of key pieces of information, the action brings disastrous results.&lt;ref&gt;Hey, O. "ἁμαρτία Zur Bedeutungsgeschichte des Wortes" ''Philologus'' 83 1-15, (1928). Web. 7 Dec. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; J.M. Bremer also conducted a thorough study of ''hamartia'' in Greek thought, focusing on its usage in Aristotle and [[Homer]]. His findings lead him, like Hyde, to cite ''hamartia'' as an intellectual error rather than a moral failing.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer, J.M. "Hamartia." Tragic Error in the Poetics of Aristotle and in Greek Tragedy. Amsterdam, Adolf M. Hakkert, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical arguments on divine intervention===

J.M. Bremer and Dawe both conclude that the will of the gods may factor into Aristotelian ''hamartia''. Golden disagrees.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Bremer observes that the Messenger in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' says, "He was raging - one of the dark powers pointing the way, ...someone, something leading him on - he hurled at the twin doors and bending the bolts back out of their sockets, crashed through the chamber,".&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, 85&lt;/ref&gt; Bremer cites Sophocles' mention of Oedipus being possessed by "dark powers" as evidence of guidance from either divine or daemonic force. 

Dawe's argument centers around tragic dramatists' four areas from which a protagonist's demise can originate. The first is fate, the second is wrath of an angry god, the third comes from a human enemy, and the last is the protagonist's frailty or error. Dawe contends that the tragic ''[[dénouement]]'' can be the result of a divine plan as long as plot action begets plot action in accordance with Aristotle. 

Golden cites Van Braam's notion of Oedipus committing a tragic error by trusting his own intellect in spite of Tiresias' warning as the argument for human error over divine manipulation. Golden concludes that ''hamartia'' principally refers to a matter of intellect, although it may include elements of morality. What his study asserts is separate from ''hamartia'', in a view that conflicts with Dawe's and Bremer's, is the concept of divine retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Slavery}}

'''Slavery in New Jersey''' began in the early 17th century, when Dutch colonists imported African slaves for labor to develop their colony of [[New Netherland]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/scarlet-and-black/9780813591520|title=Scarlet and Black: Slavery and Dispossession in Rutgers History|last=|first=|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780813591520|editor-last=Fuentes|editor-first=Marisa|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=|editor-last2=White|editor-first2=Deborah Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|44}}  After [[England]] took control the colony in 1664, its colonists continued the [[Atlantic slave trade|importation of slaves from Africa]]. They also imported "seasoned" slaves from their colonies in the [[West Indies]] and enslaved [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] from the [[Carolinas]].

Most [[Dutch American|Dutch]] and English immigrants entered the colony as [[indentured servant]]s, who worked for a fixed number of years to repay their passage. As conditions in England improved and the number of indentured laborers declined, New Jersey's colonists imported more [[Africans]] for needed labor. To promote increasing the number of laborers and settlers in order to develop the colony, the colonial government awarded settlers [[headrights]] of {{convert|60|acre|ha}} of land for each person transported to the colony. In 1704, after [[East Jersey]] and [[West Jersey]] unified, the [[Province of New Jersey]] passed a slave code prohibiting slaves and free blacks from owning property, further restricting African Americans in the state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|44}}

During the [[American Revolution]], enslaved African Americans fought on each side. The British Crown promised freedom to slaves who would leave their rebel masters and fight for the British. The number of blacks in Manhattan increased to 10,000, as thousands of slaves escaped to the British for the promise of freedom. The British refused to return former slaves to the Americans and they evacuated many Black Loyalists together with their troops and other Loyalists; they resettled more than 3,000 freedmen in their colony of Nova Scotia. Others were transported to England and the West Indies.

Bergen County developed as the largest slaveholding county in the state,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.bergen.org/ourstory/Resources/slave&amp;war/sl_secondary.htm "Bergen County Slavery"], Bergen County, accessed 13 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; in part because many slaves were used as laborers in its ports and cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Michael V.|date=2003-01-01|title=THE HIDDEN ECONOMY OF SLAVERY: COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL HIRING IN PENNSYLVANIA, NEW JERSEY AND DELAWARE, 1728-1800|url=https://doaj.org/|journal=Essays in Economic and Business History|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|issn=0896-226X}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Revolutionary War, many northern states rapidly passed laws to abolish slavery, but New Jersey did not abolish it until 1804, and then in a process of gradual emancipation similar to that of New York. But, in New Jersey, some slaves were held as late as 1865. (In New York, they were all freed by 1827.) The law made African Americans free at birth, but it required children (born to slave mothers), to serve lengthy [[apprenticeship]]s as a type of [[indentured servant]] until early adulthood for the masters of their slave mothers. New Jersey was the last of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Northern]] states to abolish slavery completely. The last 16 slaves in New Jersey were freed in 1865 by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/social_issues/jan-june07/divided_01-25.html "Interview: James Oliver Horton: Exhibit Reveals History of Slavery in New York City"], PBS Newshour, 25 January 2007, accessed 11 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dutch West India Company]] introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven black slaves to [[New Amsterdam]], capital of the nascent province of [[New Netherland]].

English traders continued to import African slaves after they took over the colony from the Dutch in 1664 and established a proprietorship. Eager to attract more settlers and laborers to develop the colony, the proprietorship encouraged the importation of slaves for labor by offering settlers [[headright]]s, an award of allocations of land based on the number of workers, slaves or indentured servants, imported to the colony.  The first African slaves to appear in English records were owned by Colonel [[Lewis Morris (governor)|Lewis Morris]] in [[Shrewsbury, New Jersey|Shrewsbury]].&lt;ref name="shakir"&gt;{{cite news |first=Nancy |last=Shakir |url=http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_jersey.htm |title=Slavery in New Jersey |accessdate=2008-10-22 |quote= |publisher=[[Slaveryinamerica]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20031017072606/http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_jersey.htm |archivedate=2003-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an early attempt to encourage European settlement, the New Jersey legislature enacted a prohibitive tariff against imported slaves to encourage European indentured servitude.&lt;ref name="SimeonRoyal"&gt;

The slave trade was a royal monopoly and had become a lucrative enterprise.&lt;ref name="SimeonRoyal"/&gt;

The liberties of the enslaved peoples of New Jersey were formally curtailed under a law passed in 1704, a so-called 'slave code'. This code prohibited the owning of property for not only slaves, but also free African Americans as well.

==Post-American Revolution==
African-American slaves fought on both sides in the War for Independence. The British Crown promised slaves freedom for leaving their rebel masters to join their cause. The number of blacks in New York rose to 10,000 as slaves escaped there from both northern and southern masters after the British occupied the city. The British kept their promise and evacuated thousands of [[freedmen]] from New York, resettling 3,500 [[Black Loyalists]] in its colony of Nova Scotia and others in the Caribbean islands.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_jersey.htm Nancy Shakir, "Slavery in New Jersey"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20031017072606/http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_jersey.htm |date=2003-10-17 }}, Slavery in America, Accessed 24 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colonel Tye]], also known as Titus Cornelius (c. 1753–1780),&lt;ref name="Colonel Tye"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2p52.html "Colonel Tye"], ''Africans in America'', PBS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.co.th"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=arI0HSFXwLkC&amp;pg=PA420&amp;lpg=PA420&amp;dq=colonel+tye&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HOeY5ga053&amp;sig=t6wbrY5bWDZMQ6ESpUnUJjyFNR0&amp;hl=th&amp;ei=mi6eScL8NtK6kAWogO3GCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result Jonathan D.

Accessed 28 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades before the Revolution, slaves were numerous near [[Perth Amboy]], a major point of entry, and in the eastern counties. Slaves were generally used for agricultural labor, but they also filled skilled artisan jobs in shipyards and industry in coastal cities.

==Abolition of slavery==
Following the Revolutionary War, New Jersey banned the importation of slaves in 1788, but at the same time forbade free blacks from elsewhere from settling in the state.&lt;ref name="slavenorth.com"&gt;[http://www.slavenorth.com/newjersey.htm Slavery in the North], Accessed 28 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two decades after the war, many northern states rapidly abolished slavery, and some slaveholders independently manumitted their slaves. Some people of color left the areas where they had been enslaved and moved to more frontier areas. Since slaves were widely used in agriculture, as well as the ports, the [[New Jersey state legislature]] was the last in the North to abolish slavery, passing a law in 1804 for its gradual abolition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://njlegallib.rutgers.edu/slavery/acts/A78.html "An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery"] (15 February 1804), electronically transcribed text of act of the New Jersey State Legislature published by the New Jersey Digital Legal Library (hosted by Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey).  Accessed 24 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1804 statute and subsequent laws freed children born after the law was passed. African Americans born to slave mothers after July 4, 1804 had to serve lengthy [[apprenticeship]]s to the owners of their mothers. Women were freed at 21, but men were not emancipated until the age of 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slavenorth.com/newjersey.htm Douglas Harper, "Slavery in New Jersey"], Slavery in the North website, 2003, accessed 13 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves who had been born before these laws were passed were considered, after 1846, as [[indentured servants]] who were "apprenticed for life."&lt;ref name="Abolish"&gt;[http://njlegallib.rutgers.edu/slavery/acts/A98.html "An Act to Abolish Slavery"] (18 April 1846), electronically transcribed text of act of the New Jersey State Legislature published by the New Jersey Digital Legal Library (hosted by Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey).Accessed 21 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although at first New Jersey allowed [[free people of color]] to vote, the legislature disfranchised them in 1807, an exclusion that lasted until 1875. By 1830 two-thirds of the slaves remaining in the North were held by masters in New Jersey, as New York had freed the last of its slaves in 1827 under gradual abolition. It was not until 1846 that New Jersey abolished slavery, but it qualified it by redefining former slaves as apprentices who were "apprenticed for life" to their masters.&lt;ref name="slavenorth.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abolish"/&gt; Slavery did not truly end in the state until it was ended nationally in 1865 after the [[American Civil War]] and passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] to the US Constitution.

According to James Gigantino, during the early nineteenth century in New Jersey, there were more female than male slaves.  After the passage of the Act of Gradual Abolition in New Jersey in 1804, a greater number of advertisements in the state for the full-title sale of female slaves of child-bearing age were published.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ragged Road to Abolition|last=Gigantino|first=James J. II.|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2014|isbn=9780812290226|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Female slaves and their reproductive capabilities were highly valuable because their children would be born as slaves for a term, even after the 1804 Act of Gradual Abolition.  However, domestic skills and labor also affected the value and marketability of female slaves.  By 1830, African Americans made up 6% of the total population of New Jersey. The city of New Brunswick had a large African American Population at an around 11%. This added one of the reasons why New Brunswick was a favorable location for runaways, but it also made the city into a popular site for slave hunters, who wished to enforce The Fugitive Slave Laws of 1850.&lt;ref name=":01"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scarlet and Black: Slavery and Dispossession in Rutgers History|last=Fuentes|first=Marisa J.|last2=White|first2=Deborah Grey|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=New Brunswick|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more urban areas of the state, like New Brunswick, NJ, there were a greater number of slave sale advertisements for female slaves prior to and post-passage of the 1804 Act of Gradual Abolition. This was because female slaves were more highly favored for domestic work, which was more prominent in urban spaces like New Brunswick.  Enslaved women, however, were not confined to this work, and also performed manual labor across the state of New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1 January 2007|title=In Pressing Need of Cash: Gender, Skill, and Family Persistence in the Domestic Slave Trade|jstor=i20064147|journal=Journal of African American History|volume=92| issue = 1|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the Gradual Abolition Act of 1804 did not guarantee that a slave born after 1804 would gain their freedom. Slaveholders would regularly sell those slaves down south to states like Louisiana before the slaves reached manumission age, so they could make money off of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scarlet and Black: Slavery and Dispossession in Rutgers History|last=Fuentes|first=Marisa J.|last2=White|first2=Deborah Gray|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=New Brunswick|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1830s, slavery was on the decline in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scarlet and Black: Slavery and Dispossession in Rutgers History|last=Fuentes|first=Marisa J.|last2=White|first2=Deborah Gray|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=New Brunswick|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accoriding to James J Gigantino, at the University of Arkansas,  the efforts of New Jersey to legally abolish slavery during the years prior to the Civil War  took a long period of time to officially abolish the practice, claiming that one in ten slaves remained that way for life. Many slaveholders sold their slaves to Southern slaveholders, and displayed an apathy for abolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gigantino|first=James J.|last2=|first2=|last3=|date=|title=TRADING IN JERSEY SOULS:|url=|journal=Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies|volume=77|issue=3|pages=282|doi=10.5325/pennhistory.77.3.0281|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that about one quarter of New Jersey's African American population was forced into labor during the 1830s.  Improper information regarding who was free led to it appearing as though slavery decreased more rapidly than it actually did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gigantino|first1=James|title=The Whole North Is Not Abolitionized|website=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Civil War==
A total of 2,909 [[United States Colored Troops]] from New Jersey served in the Union Army. Because of the state's long-term apprenticeship requirements, at the close of the [[American Civil War]], some African Americans in New Jersey remained in bondage. It was not until the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was passed in 1865 that the last 16 slaves in the state were freed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Snell, James P. ''History of Sussex and Warren Counties, New Jersey, With Illustrations and Biographical Sketches of Its Prominent Men and Pioneers''. (Philadelphia: Everts &amp; Peck, 1881). No ISBN (Pre-1964). Note: Several families in northwestern New Jersey (Sussex County) had slaves who, while legally "freed" by their owners, refused to leave their former masters.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860 census, free colored persons in New Jersey numbered 25,318, about 4% of the state's population of 672,035. By 1870 the number had increased to 30,658, but they constituted a smaller percentage of the total population because of the high rate of European immigration. Overall, New Jersey's population had increased to 906,096, with nearly 200,000 European immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1860 and 1870 censuses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=2007-08-23 }}. Accessed 28 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

New Jersey was slow to abolish slavery and reluctant to pass the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]],&lt;ref name="shakir"/&gt; which it did in January 1866.  Some of its industries, such as shoes and clothing, had strong markets in the South supplying planters for their slaves, which was probably a factor.&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey ratified the 13th Amendment on 23 January 1866, after having rejected the amendment on 16 March 1865.

The '''insurgency in Aceh''' was a conflict fought by the [[Free Aceh Movement]]  (GAM) between 1976 and 2005, with the goal of making the province of Aceh independent from [[Indonesia]]. The Indonesian state had designated it as the "Aceh Disturbance"  (or ''Pemberontakan Aceh''). Effects of strong military offensive in 2003 and [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]{{citation needed lead|date=August 2016}} brought a peace deal and an end to the insurgency.

== Background ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
There is something of a cultural and religious difference between Aceh and much of the rest of Indonesia. A more conservative form of [[Islam]] than is mainstream in most of Indonesia is widely practised in Aceh.  The broadly [[secular]] policies of [[Suharto]]'s New Order regime (1965–1998) were especially unpopular in Aceh where many resented the central government's policy of promoting a unified 'Indonesian culture'. Further, not surprisingly given the location of the province at the northern end of Indonesia, there is a widespread feeling in the province that leaders in distant Jakarta do not understand Aceh's problems and have little sympathy for local needs and customs in Aceh.

== Timeline ==

=== First phase ===
The centralist tendencies of the government of [[Suharto]], along with other grievances, led [[Hasan di Tiro]] to form the [[Free Aceh Movement]] (GAM) on 4 December 1976 and declare Acehnese independence. The main perceived threats were to Acehnese religion and culture from the "neo-colonial" government and the rising numbers of [[Java (island)|Javanese]] migrants into Aceh. The perceived unfair distribution of income from Aceh's substantial natural resources was another point of contention. GAM's first operation in 1977 was carried out against [[Mobil Oil]] Indonesia which was the shareholder of PT Arun, the company which operated the Arun gas field.

At this stage, the numbers mobilised by GAM were extremely limited. While there had been considerable Acehnese disaffection and possibly sympathy for GAM's cause, this did not translate into mass active participation.&lt;ref name=Schulz_p14&gt;{{harvp|Schulze|2004|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By di Tiro's own account, only 70 men joined him and they came mostly from the district of [[Pidie]] and especially from di Tiro's own village—with some of them joining due to personal loyalties to the di Tiro family while others due to disillusionment with the central government.&lt;ref name=Schulz_p14/&gt;  Many of GAM's leaders were young and highly educated professionals who were members of the upper and middle classes of Acehnese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|di Tiro|1984|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; GAM's first cabinet, set up by di Tiro during his time in Aceh between 1976 and 1979, composed of the following [[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam rebellion]].:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schulze|2004|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Teungku [[Hasan di Tiro]]: ''Wali Negara'', defence minister, and supreme commander
* Dr. Muchtar Hasbi: vice-president; minister of internal affairs
* Tengku Muhamad Usman Lampoih Awe: minister of finance
* Tengku Haji Iljas Leube: minister of justice
* Dr. Husaini M. Hasan: minister of education and information
* Dr. [[Zaini Abdullah]]: minister of health
* Dr. Zubir Mahmud: minister of social affairs
* Dr. Asnawi Ali: minister of public works and industry
* Amir Ishak: minister of communications
* Amir Rashid Mahmud: minister of trade
* Malik Mahmud: minister of state

[[File:Teuku Daud Beureueh.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Teungku Daud Beureueh]]

The mid-level and rank-and-file had fought in the 1953–59 [[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam rebellion]].&lt;ref name=Schulz_p14/&gt; Many of them were older men who remained loyal to former Aceh military governor and leader of the Darul Islam rebellion in Aceh [[Daud Bereueh|Daud Beureueh]].&lt;ref name="Aspinall_Islam_64"&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent person of this group was Teungku Ilyas Leube, a well-known cleric who had been a leader of the Darul Islam rebellion.&lt;ref name="Aspinall_Islam_64"/&gt; Some of the Darul Islam men were possibility linked to di Tiro through family or regional ties but they owed their loyalty primarily to Beureueh.&lt;ref name="Aspinall_Islam_64"/&gt; These men provided the military know-how, local knowledge and logistical skills which the young educated leaders lacked.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_64/&gt;

By the end of 1979, Indonesian suppression actions had all but crushed GAM—its leaders were either in exile, imprisoned, or killed; its followers were dispersed and pushed underground.&lt;ref name=Schulz_p4&gt;{{harvp|Schulze|2004|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders such as di Tiro, Zaini Abdullah (GAM minister of health), Malik Mahmud (GAM minister of state), and Dr. Husaini M. Hasan (GAM minister of education) had fled overseas and the original GAM cabinet ceased to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schulze|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second phase ===
In 1985, di Tiro secured Libyan support for GAM—taking advantage of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s policy of supporting nationalist rebellions through his Mathaba Against Imperialism, Racism, Zionism and Fascism.&lt;ref name="Aspinall_Islam_105" /&gt; It was not clear if Libya had subsequently funded GAM but what it definitely provided was a sanctuary in which GAM recruits could receive much-needed military training.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_105/&gt; Accounts differ on the number of fighters trained by Libya during the period of 1986 to 1989 or 1990.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_105/&gt; GAM recruiters claimed that there were around 1,000 to 2,000 while press reports drawing from Indonesian military's report claimed that they numbered 600 to 800.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_105/&gt;  Among the GAM leaders who joined during this phase were Sofyan Dawood (who would become GAM commander [[Pasai|Pasè]], North Aceh) and Ishak Daud (who became the spokesman for GAM [[Peureulak]], East Aceh).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schulze|2004|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents in the second phase began in 1989 after the return of the trainees from Libya.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_110&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operations by GAM included weapons raiding, attacks against police and military posts, arsons and targeted assassinations of police and military personnel, government informants and other individuals.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_110/&gt;

Although it failed to gain widespread support, the group's actions led the Indonesian government to institute repressive measures. The period between 1989 and 1998 became known as the [[1990-98 Indonesian military operations in Aceh|"Military Operation Area" or ''Daerah Operasi Militer'' (DOM)]] era as the Indonesian military stepped up its counter-insurgency measures.&lt;ref name=Schulz_p4/&gt;  This measure, although tactically successful in destroying GAM as a guerilla force, alienated the local Acehnese which helped GAM re-establish itself when Indonesian military was almost totally withdrawn from Aceh by order of president [[Habibie]] in late-1998.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Sebastian, "Realpolitik: Indonesia's Use of Military Force", 2006, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Important GAM commanders were either killed (Pase district commander Yusuf Ali and senior GAM commander Keuchik Umar), captured (Ligadinsyah Ibrahim) or fled (Robert, Arjuna and Daud Kandang).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third phase ===
[[File:Free Aceh Movement women soldiers.jpg|thumb|Women soldiers of the Free Aceh Movement with GAM commander Abdullah Syafei'i, 1999]]

In 1999, chaos in Java and an ineffective central government due to the fall of [[Suharto]] gave an advantage to [[Free Aceh Movement]] and resulted in the second phase of the rebellion, this time with large support from the Acehnese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Miller|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 a troop withdrawal was announced, but the deteriorating security situation led to re-introduction of more soldiers and troop numbers were believed to have risen during President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]]'s term in office (2001–2004) to around 15,000 by mid-2002. GAM was able to control 70 percent of the countryside in all of Aceh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Indonesian Observer|date=2 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 1999 also saw the start of the first ever dialogue process between the Indonesian Government and GAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Conflict Management and Dispute Settlement in East Asia|last = Amer|first = Ramses|publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year = 2011|isbn = 1409419975|location = |pages = 87|last2 = Zou |first2 = Keyuan}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was initiated by the [[Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue]] (HD) a private diplomacy organization that facilitated peace talks between the two sides until 2003.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/PS001.pdf?q=kebangkitan-aceh|title = The Aceh Peace Process: Why it Failed|last = Aspinall|first = Edward|journal = Policy Studies 1|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Crouch|first2 = Harold|publisher = East-West Center Washington|issue = |isbn = 1-932728-01-5|year = 2003|pages = 18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this phase, there were two periods of brief cessation of hostilities brokered by HD: the "[https://web.archive.org/web/20151117023926/http://www.hdcentre.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Our_work/Peacemaking/Aceh_Indonesia/Supporting_documents/Joint-Understanding-for-a-Humanitarian-Pause-12-May-2000.pdf Humanitarian Pause]"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SECRETARY-GENERAL WELCOMES "HUMANITARIAN PAUSE" AGREEMENT BETWEEN INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT, FREE ACEH MOVEMENT {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|url = https://www.un.org/press/en/2000/20000512.sgsm7394.doc.html|website = www.un.org|accessdate = 2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2000 and the [http://peacemaker.un.org/indonesia-cessationhostilities2002 "Cessation of Hostilities Agreement]" (COHA). The COHA was signed in December 2002. The implementation of both the Humanitarian Pause and the COHA resulted in a reduction of armed clashes and violence in Aceh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Military operations in Aceh to start soon|url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2003/05/07/military-operations-aceh-start-soon.html|website = www.thejakartapost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-14|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033043/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2003/05/07/military-operations-aceh-start-soon.html|archivedate = 17 November 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The COHA ended in May 2003 when the Indonesian government declared a “military emergency” in Aceh and announced that it wanted to destroy GAM once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2005|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a break from its emphasis on military means of attaining independence, GAM shifted its position to one supporting the holding of a referendum. During 8 November 1999 pro-referendum demonstrations in [[Banda Aceh]], GAM gave support by providing transport to protesters from rural areas to the provincial capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Millions demand referendum in Aceh|url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/18871|publisher=Green Left|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 July 2002, GAM also issued the Stavanger Declaration following a meeting of the Worldwide Achehnese Representatives Meeting in Stavanger, Norway.&lt;ref name="Stavanger"&gt;{{cite web|title=Acheh: The Stavanger Declaration|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/747|publisher=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the declaration, it declared that the "State of Acheh practices the system of democracy."&lt;ref name="Stavanger"/&gt; Aspinall saw that these democratic and human rights impulses within GAM as an effect of the efforts of urban-based Acehnese group which were promoting such values in the freer and more open environment following the fall of Soeharto from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Security crackdowns in 2001 and 2002 resulted in several thousand civilian deaths. Throughout the conflict an estimated 15,000 people have been killed. The government launched [[2003-2004 Indonesian offensive in Aceh|an offensive]] and a [[state of emergency]] was proclaimed in the Province. During this period, the GAM was severely disabled with its commander Abdullah Syafei killed in a government ambush in January 2002, while various regional commanders such as Tengku Jamaica and Ishak Daud were also killed. By GAM's own admission, it lost 50% of its strength during the government offensive of 2003–2005. The insurgency was still going on when the [[Indian Ocean Tsunami|Tsunami Disaster of 2004]] struck the province. In November 2003 the martial law was extended for a further six months. According to a [[Human Rights Watch]] report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/reports/2003/indonesia1203/5.htm#_Toc58915047 Human Rights Watch]&lt;/ref&gt; the Indonesian military committed widespread [[human rights abuses]] during the invasion and occupation, with more than 100,000 people being displaced in the first seven months of martial law and extrajudicial killings being common.

=== The peace agreement and first local elections ===

After the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|devastating tsunami]] in December 2004, GAM declared a unilateral cease-fire, with members of the international community reiterating the need to resolve the conflict. Of the numerous accounts of the negotiation process, one from the Indonesian side is in the book by the Indonesian key negotiator, Hamid Awaludin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Awaludin|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A differing account was written by GAM adviser, Damien Kingsbury: '''Peace in Aceh: A Personal Account of the Aceh Peace Process'' &lt;ref name="Kingsbury 2006 15"&gt;{{harvp|Kingsbury|2006|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite GAM's unilateral ceasefire, the TNI continued its assault on GAM personnel and positions. Because of the separatist movement in the area, the Indonesian government had access restrictions in place on the press and aid workers. After the tsunami, however, the Indonesian government opened the region up to international relief efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiapacific.ca/analysis/pubs/pdfs/commentary/cac43.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228013211/http://www.asiapacific.ca/analysis/pubs/pdfs/commentary/cac43.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tsunami drew international attention to the conflict. Earlier peace efforts had failed, but for a number of reasons, including the tsunami, the inability of either side to militarily win the conflict and, notably, a desire by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to secure peace in Indonesia, a peace agreement was reached in 2005 after 29 years of war. Post-[[Suharto]] Indonesia and the liberal-democratic reform period, as well as changes in the Indonesian military, helped create an environment more favourable to peace talks. The roles of newly elected President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] and Vice-President [[Jusuf Kalla]] were highly significant.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Awaludin|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the GAM leadership was reconsidering options available to it, and the [[Military of Indonesia|Indonesian military]] had put the rebel movement under significant pressure that encouraged GAM to accept an outcome short of full independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HH15Ae01.html Asia Times Online :: Southeast Asia news – A happy, peaceful anniversary in Aceh&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The peace talks were facilitated by the [[Crisis Management Initiative]] and led by former Finnish President [[Martti Ahtisaari]]. The resulting peace agreement &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aceh-mm.org/download/english/Helsinki%20MoU.pdf Text of the MOU] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130418023930/http://www.aceh-mm.org/download/english/Helsinki%20MoU.pdf |date=18 April 2013 }} (PDF format)&lt;/ref&gt; was signed on 15 August 2005. Under the agreement, Aceh would receive special autonomy under the Republic of [[Indonesia]], and non-organic (i.e. non-Aceh native) government troops would be withdrawn from the province (leaving only 25,000 soldiers) in exchange for GAM's disarmament. As part of the agreement, the [[European Union]] dispatched 300 [[Aceh monitoring mission|monitors]]. Their mission expired on 15 December 2006, following local elections.

Aceh has been granted broader autonomy through Aceh Government Legislation covering special rights agreed upon in 2002 as well as the right of the Acehnese to establish local political parties to represent their interests. However, Human rights advocates highlighted that previous human rights violations in the province would need to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/09/19/indone11764.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Acehnese regional election, 2006|elections for the provincial governor]] held in December 2006, the former GAM and national parties participated. The election was won by [[Irwandi Yusuf]], whose base of support consists largely of ex-GAM members.

== Possible causes of conflict ==

=== Historical ===

The area first fell Dutch authority as a result of the [[Dutch expedition on the west coast of Sumatra]] of 1831.

[[Australian National University]] (ANU) academic Edward Aspinall argued that the historical experience of Aceh during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] led to a “path-dependent” development for Acehnese separatism – i.e. past events lead to a narrowing of the possibilities for subsequent development. He argued:

:Acehnese rebelliousness under Indonesian rule was path dependent; it can be traced to particular historical events and conflicts of interest, notably the autonomy that the modernist ''ulama'' [Muslim religious scholars] enjoyed during the revolution and the dramatic loss of it immediately after.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspinall argued further that there were two milestones for the “path-dependent” development of Aceh separatism:

:1945 – 49: Aceh played an important role in the revolution and war of independence against the Dutch and consequently was allegedly able to extract a promise from then-President [[Soekarno]] during his 1947 visit to Aceh that it would be allowed to implement [[Islamic law]] (or ''syariah'') following independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1953 – 62: Aceh military governor Daud Beureueh declared that the province would secede from Republik Indonesia (RI) to join the Negara Islam Indonesia (NII) in reaction to the refusal of the central government to allow the implementation of ''syariah'' and the downgrading of Aceh from the status of a province. This rebellion which Aceh was a part of came to be known as the [[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam Rebellion]]. Aspinall argued that the failure of this rebellion marked the end of Acehnese identification with a pan-Indonesian/Islamic cause and laid the groundwork for particularism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above argument by Aspinall contradicted the views of earlier scholars. Earlier in 1998, Geoffrey Robinson argued that the 1962 defeat and surrender of the Daud Beureueh-led rebellion was followed by roughly 15 years in which Aceh presented no particular security or political problem to the central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Robinson|1998|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Kell also pointed out that the former leaders of the 1953–62 rebellion had keenly joined the Indonesian armed forces in the crackdown against the [[Partai Komunis Indonesia]] (PKI) in 1965 and 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kell|1995|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
Aceh like most of Indonesia, had Muslims as the majority religious group. However, it is generally acknowledged that it was the region where Islam first entered into the Malay archipelago. The first known Islamic kingdom was [[Pasai]] (near present-day [[Lhokseumawe]] in northern Aceh) which dates back to the mid-13th century. The earliest found archaeological evidence to support this view was the tomb stone of Sultan [[Malik ul Salih]] who died in 1297. In the centuries that followed, Pasai became known as a centre for Islamic learning and a model for Islamic governance in which other Islamic kingdoms look to for guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the distinct Acehnese identity would stem from its status as the earliest Islamic region and the exemplar for the rest of the Malay archipelago.

This separateness from the rest of Indonesia where Islam is concerned could be observed from the formation of the ''Persatuan Ulama Seluruh Aceh'' (PUSA) in 1939 by modernist Islamic scholars (or ''[[ulama]]''). The organisation was exclusively Acehnese. It was noted that in Aceh itself, most pan-Indonesian mass organisations had been weak—even the [[Muhammadiyah]], the main organisation for modernist-oriented Muslims in Indonesia failed to make inroads in Aceh beyond urban areas and was largely non-Acehnese in its membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morris|1983|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was also noted that though PUSA was parochial in its orientation, it nonetheless still identified with a pan-Islamic cause where the goal was for all Muslims to be united under the ''syariah''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morris|1983|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor of the religious cause for Aceh's separatism was the treatment of Muslim groups and political parties in Aceh by President [[Soeharto]]'s ''[[Orde Baru]]'' regime.  First, there was the forced fusion of all political parties representing Muslim interests into the ''[[United Development Party|Partai Persatuan Pembangunan]]'' (PPP) or United Development Party in 1973. Members and followers of Islamic political parties in Aceh suffered from varying degrees of harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Aceh's special territory status, it was not allowed to implement ''syariah'' nor to integrate Islamic religious schools (''madrasah'') with mainstream national schools for a unified education system—both proposals were ignored by the central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morris|1983|pp=276–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Indonesia being a Muslim majority state, building on Aceh's existing self-conception of its role in Islam and the ''Orde Baru'''s hostile attitude towards Islamic forms of societal influence, GAM was able to frame the struggle against the Indonesian government as a "''prang sabi''" (holy war) in much the same way the term was used in the Infidel War (or [[Aceh War]]) against the Dutch from 1873 to 1913. An indication of this was the use of the words of ''[[:id:Hikayat Prang Sabi|Hikayat Prang Sabi]]'' (Tales of Holy War), a collection of tales used to inspire resistance against the Dutch, by some elements of GAM as propaganda against the Indonesian government. Before the second wave of insurrections by GAM in the late-1980s, it was observed that some individuals had forced Acehnese school children to sing the ''Hikayat Prang Sabi'' instead of Indonesia's national anthem, ''[[Indonesia Raya]]''.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_110/&gt; GAM political publicity material also painted the official state ideology of ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]'' as a "polytheistic teaching".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the above, it was observed that in the aftermath of the fall of Soeharto in 1998, religion as a factor for Aceh separatism began to subside even if there had been a proliferation of Muslim student unions and other groups in Aceh. It was noted that these newly-emerged groups rarely called for the implementation of ''syariah'' in Aceh. Instead, they emphasised the need for a referendum on Aceh's independence and highlighted the human rights abuses and misconduct of the [[Indonesian Armed Forces]] (TNI).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, GAM's position on ''syariah'' also shifted. When the central government passed the Law No. 44/1999 on Aceh Autonomy which included provisions for the implementation of ''syariah'', GAM condemned the move as irrelevant and a possible attempt to deceive Acehnese and or portray them to the outside world as religious fanatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the official stance on ''syariah'', GAM's position was not a clear cut one. It was noted by the [[International Crisis Group]] (ICG) that between 1999 and 2001, there were periodic instances of some GAM local military commanders enforcing ''syariah'' in communities where they had influence in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Islamic Law and Criminal Justice in Aceh|journal=International Crisis Group|date=31 July 2006|issue=117|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspinall also observed that overall, the evolution of GAM's position vis-a-via ''syariah'' and Islam was dependent on the international environment and which countries it targeted for support in its cause for independence – i.e. if western countries were deemed important, Islam was de-emphasised and if Muslim countries were deemed important, Islam would be emphasised.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|pp=200–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic grievances ===
The main issue pertaining to economic grievances were related to the revenues derived from the oil and gas industries in Aceh. Robinson argued that the ''Orde Baru'''s management and exploitation of Aceh's resources and the way it distributed the benefits was the root cause of the insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Robinson|1998|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1970s to the mid-1980s, Aceh had undergone a "[[LNG]] boom" following the discovery [[natural gas]] on the northeast coast of Aceh. Over the same period, Aceh became a major source of revenue for the central government and in the 1980s, it contributed significantly to Indonesia's exports when it became the third largest source of exports after the provinces of [[East Kalimantan]] and [[Riau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dawood|Syafrizal|1989|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, practically all oil and gas revenues from production and exports activities in Aceh was appropriated by the central government either directly or through production sharing agreements with state oil company [[Pertamina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dawood|Syafrizal|1989|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the central government did not re-invest a fair amount of the revenues back into the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Robinson|1998|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led some of Aceh's then-emerging technocratic class to lament that the province had been denied its fair share of the economic pie and that it had been marginalised as an ignored peripheral region.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kell|1995|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson noted that though some of Aceh's small but burgeoning business class had benefited from the influx of foreign capital during the LNG boom, there were many who felt aggrieved at losing out to others with good political connections to the central government—most notably, the leader of GAM himself, Hasan di Tiro was one such aggrieved party when he made a bid for an oil pipeline contract for Mobile Oil Indonesia in 1974 but lost out to a US company.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Robinson|1998|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further noted that the timing of GAM's declaration of independence in December 1976 and its first military action in 1977 happened at roughly the same time that Aceh's first natural gas extraction and processing facility had opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Robinson|1998|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in GAM's declaration of independence, the following claim was made:

:Acheh, Sumatra has been producing a revenue of over 15 billion US dollars yearly for the Javanese neocolonialists, which they used totally for the benefit of Java and the Javanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|di Tiro|1984|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the above, Robinson noted that while this factor partly explained the emergence of the insurgency in the mid-1970s, they do not appear to explain the re-emergence of GAM in 1989 and the never-before seen levels of violence thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Robinson|1998|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspinall supports this viewpoint and argued that though resource and economic grievances should not be discounted, they were not decisive as the provinces of Riau and East Kalimantan both faced similar or even harsher exploitation by the central government but no separatist rebellions took place in those two provinces due to the difference in political conditions.&lt;ref name="Aspinall_Grievance"&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2007|pp=964–967}}&lt;/ref&gt; He furthered that the resource-based grievance was a means for GAM to convince Acehnese that they should abandon hopes of special treatment and autonomy within Indonesia and instead work for the restoration of Aceh's glory by seeking independence.&lt;ref name="Aspinall_Grievance"/&gt;

=== Role of GAM in galvanising grievances ===
GAM's founder Hasan di Tiro and his fellow leaders in exile in Sweden were instrumental in providing a coherent message on both the necessity and right of self-determination for Aceh. Accordingly, arguments on the need for independence was targeted at the domestic Acehnese audience while the right to independence was targeted at the international audience to win diplomatic support.

In such propaganda, the defunct [[Aceh Sultanate]] was cast as a ''bona fide'' sovereign actor on the international stage with emphasis on the sultanate's past relations with European states – diplomatic missions, treaties as well as statements of recognition of Aceh's sovereignty.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_76&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In accordance to this logic, an independent Aceh (as represented by GAM) would be the successor state to the Aceh Sultanate before defeat by the Dutch following the Aceh War (1873–1913).&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_76/&gt; The Aceh War was thus seen as an unlawful act of aggression by the Dutch and the subsequent incorporation of Aceh into Indonesia in 1949 was cast as an extension of the unlawful occupation by the Dutch.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_76/&gt; This argument targeted at both the Acehnese themselves as well as the international community—i.e. through its appeal to international law.

In the same vein, the state of Indonesia was cast by GAM propaganda as a cover for Javanese domination. In di Tiro's own description:

:"Indonesia" was a fraud. A cloak to cover up Javanese colonialism. Since the world begun [sic], there never was a people, much less a nation, in our part of the world by that name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|di Tiro|1984|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts at spreading GAM propaganda relied much on word of mouth. Elizabeth Drexler had observed that ordinary Acehnese and GAM supporters often repeat the same claims made in GAM's propaganda which they had come into contact with through this mode of dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Drexler|2008|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late M. Isa Sulaiman wrote that when di Tiro first started his secessionist activities between 1974 and 1976, he had relied on a network of relatives and a number of like-minded young intellectuals to spread his message—which gained traction especially in Medan, North Sumatra.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sulaiman|2006|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspinall also wrote of GAM sympathizers' recollection of the early days of the insurrection in which they would pass pamphlets to friends or slide them anonymously under the doors of their colleagues' offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the propaganda efforts were however quite mixed. Eric Morris when interviewing GAM supporters for his 1983 thesis noted that, rather than independence, they were more interested in either an Indonesian Islamic state or for Aceh to be treated more fairly by the central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morris|1983|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspinall also noted that for some, GAM did not clearly differentiate itself from [[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam]] or the [[United Development Party]] which was campaigning on an Islamic platform for the [[Indonesian legislative election, 1977|Indonesian legislative election in 1977]].&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_79&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; For individuals who had become core supporters however, the message of independence found in GAM's propaganda was seen as revelatory and many saw felt a moment of awakening.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_79/&gt;

== Possible factors for prolonged conflict ==

=== Resilience of GAM's network ===
Many of the participants of GAM were either participants of the Darul Islam rebellion or were the sons of those who had. Aspinall noted that the kinship ties, between father and son as well as amongst brothers, had been crucial to GAM's solidarity as an organisation.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_91&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many felt that they were continuing the aspirations of either their fathers, uncles, brothers or male cousins who were usually the ones who inducted them into the organisation—or whose exploits or deaths at the hands of the state security apparatus had inspired them to join.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_91/&gt; GAM's constituents were also often residents in close-knit rural communities where everybody knew their neighbours well.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_91/&gt; These features enabled both continuity as well as a high-degree of resistance to infiltration by the state intelligence apparatus.

Aspinall also credited GAM's resilience on the cell-like structure at the lower levels. At the levels below the regional military commander (''panglima wilayah'') were units commanded by junior commanders (''panglima muda'') and even lower level commanders (''panglima sagoe'' and ''ulee sagoe'') who did not know the identities of their counterparts in neighbouring regions and only knew those directly above them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; These allowed GAM to survive as an organisation despite the suppression efforts of the Indonesian state.

=== Human rights abuses by Indonesian military ===
Robinson argued that the institutionalised use of terror by the [[Indonesian military]] in counter-insurgency action against GAM under the late-''Orde Baru'' period from the middle of 1990 (i.e. in the second phase of the insurrection) had led to a wider section of Acehnese being affected and pushed them to be more sympathetic and supportive of GAM.&lt;ref name=Robinson_140&gt;{{harvp|Robinson|1998|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; He assessed that such methods had the effect of escalating the level of violence, was disruptive of Acehnese society and inflicted wounds on them which proved difficult to heal.&lt;ref name=Robinson_140/&gt;   As [[Amnesty International]] noted:

:The political authority of the armed forces, considerable even under normal conditions, now became unchallengeable. In the name of national security, military and police authorities deployed in Aceh were thereafter free to use virtually any means deemed necessary to destroy the GPK (''Gerakan Pengacauan Keamanan'' or Security Disturbance Movement, which was the Indonesian government's nomenclature for GAM).&lt;ref name=AI_1993&gt;{{cite book|title=Document – Indonesia: "Shock Therapy": Restoring Order in Aceh 1989–1993|year=1993|publisher=Amnesty International|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa21/007/1993/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International documented the use of arbitrary arrests, extra-legal detention, summary executions, rape and scorch-earth as features of the Indonesian military's push against GAM since 1990. Among the more chilling acts observed by Amnesty International was the public disposal of the bodies of victims of summary executions or ''[[Petrus Killings]]'' (''Penembakan Misterius'') to serve as warnings to Acehnese to refrain from joining or supporting GAM.  The following was Amnesty International's description of such acts:

:The "mysterious killings" (''Petrus'') in Aceh had the following general features. The corpses of victims were usually left in public places – beside a main road, in fields and plantations, next to a stream or a river – apparently as a warning to others not to join or support the rebels. Most had clearly been prisoners when they were killed, their thumbs, and sometimes their feet, had been tied together with a particular type of knot. Most had been shot at close range, though the bullets were seldom found in their bodies. Most also showed signs of having been beaten with a blunt instrument or tortured, and their faces were therefore often unrecognisable. For the most part, the bodies were not recovered by relatives or friends, both out of fear of retribution by the military and because the victims were usually dumped at some distance from their home villages.&lt;ref name=AI_1993/&gt;

Another questionable tactic of the TNI was the so-called ''civil-military operations" in which civilians were compelled to participate in intelligence and security operations. A notorious example of this was the ''Operasi Pagar Betis'' (or "Fence of Legs") as described by Amnesty International below:

:....the strategy of civil-military co-operation was the "fence of legs" operation – used previously in East Timor – in which ordinary villagers were compelled to sweep through an area ahead of armed troops, in order both to flush out rebels and to inhibit them from returning fire. Essential to the success of these operations were local "vigilante" groups and night patrols made up of civilians but established under military order and supervision. Between 20 and 30 young men were mobilised from each village in suspected rebel areas. In the words of a local military commander: "The youths are the front line. They know best who the GPK are. We then settle the matter." Refusal to participate in these groups – or failure to demonstrate sufficient commitment to crushing the enemy by identifying, capturing or killing alleged rebels – sometimes resulted in punishment by government forces, including public torture, arrest and execution.&lt;ref name=AI_1993/&gt;

=== Indonesian military's interests in Aceh ===
Damien Kingsbury, who served as adviser to the GAM leadership in Stockholm and Helsinki during the Helsinki peace talks in 2005, contended that the Indonesian military had vested interests to keep the conflict at a level which would justify their presence in the restive province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kingsbury|first=Damien|author2=Lesley McCulloch|title=Military Business in Aceh|journal=Verandah of Violence: The Background to the Aceh Conflict|year=2006|series=ed Anthony Reid|pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICG also asserted in a 2003 report that, "Aceh is simply too lucrative a place for military officers who rely so heavily on non-budgetary sources of income."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Indonesian Crisis Group|title=Aceh: How Not to Win Hearts and Minds|journal=Indonesia Briefing|date=3 July 2003|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingsbury and Lesley McCulloch outlined the following business activities allegedly conducted by the Indonesian military in Aceh:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kingsbury|title=Military Businesses in Aceh|journal=Verandah of Violence|pages=212–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Drugs: Security forces encouraged local farmers to grow [[marijuana]] and paid them prices far below the black market value. One instance highlighted was a police helicopter pilot admitting after his arrest that he was flying a 40&amp;nbsp;kg consignment of the drug for his superior the police chief of [[Aceh Besar]] (note that at this point the [[Indonesian Police]] or Polri was under the command of the military). Another case was in September 2002 in which an army truck was intercepted by the police in [[Binjai]], [[North Sumatra]] with a cargo of 1,350&amp;nbsp;kg of marijuana.
* Illegal arms sale: Interviews in 2001 and 2002 with GAM leaders in Aceh revealed that some of their weapons were in fact purchased from the military. The first method of such sales was for the Indonesian military personnel to report those weapons sold as having been seized during combat. Secondly, key Indonesian military personnel with access had even directly provided GAM with a reliable supply of weapons as well as ammunition.
* Illegal/unlicensed logging: Military and police were paid by logging companies to ignore logging activities which took place outside of licensed areas. The [[Leuser]] Development Project funded by the [[European Union]] from the mid-1990s to combat [[illegal logging]] had in fact discovered that the Indonesian military and police who were supposed to assist in preventing illegal logging were in fact facilitating and, in some cases, even initiating such illegal activities.
* Protection: The military ran "protection rackets" to extract payments from companies such as Mobil and PT Arun in the oil and gas industries as well as companies operating plantations in Aceh. In return for the payments, the military would deploy its personnel at the properties and areas of operations of these companies.
* Fishery: Local fisherman were forced to sell to the military their catches at prices far below market rates. The military would in turn sell the fishes to local businesses at a much higher prices. Personnel of the [[Indonesian Navy]] might also waylay fishing vessels to extort payments from fishermen.
* Coffee: Similar to fishermen, coffee planters were compelled to sell coffee beans to the military at low prices.

== Possible factors for peaceful resolution ==

=== Weakening of GAM's military position ===
The declaration of martial law by the Indonesian government in May 2003 had resulted in a concerted push by the Indonesian military against GAM. The ICG reported that by mid-2004, GAM's supply lines and communications had been seriously disrupted.&lt;ref name=ICG_2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=International Crisis Group|title=Aceh: A New Chance for Peace|journal=Crisis Group Asia Briefing|date=15 August 2005|issue=40|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also more difficult for them to move about, and their presence in urban areas was largely rooted out.&lt;ref name=ICG_2005/&gt; As a result, GAM's command in Pidie had instructed all field commanders by telephone to pull back from the ''sagoe'' (sub-district) to the ''daerah'' (district) base and that henceforth military actions could only be undertaken on the order of the ''daerah'' commander and with the permission of the ''wilayah'' (regional) commander.&lt;ref name=ICG_2005/&gt; Previously, when GAM was in a stronger position, its sagoe level units could exercise a great level of command autonomy to initiate military actions on their own.&lt;ref name=ICG_2005/&gt;

According to then Indonesian Armed Forces Commander General [[Endriartono Sutarto]], the security forces succeeded in cutting the size of GAM's forces by 9,593—which presumably included surrenders, captures, and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Kompas|date=10 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; While doubting that the figure was accurate, most observers would agree that the renewed military push against GAM following the martial law declaration had dealt substantial damage to GAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2005|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Aspinall noted that most GAM leaders whom he had interviewed, particularly the field officers, were adamant that their acceptance of the Helsinki MoU was not due to their military weakness.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_231&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former-GAM leader [[Irwandi Yusuf]], who would go on to be the governor of Aceh through its inaugural direct gubernatorial elections on 11 December 2006, ventured that far from collapsing, the situation of GAM was actually improving as the sick and infirm were captured by the Indonesian military which left those still in the field to be unencumbered by them.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_231/&gt; However, despite the commitment of GAM forces to fight on, GAM's leaders might have, at that point, given up hope that a military victory over the government forces would be possible.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_231/&gt; In the words of former GAM prime minister Malik Mahmud to Aspinall in October 2005: "The existing strategies applied by both parties had caused a costly stalemate".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by Jakarta Post to comment on whether accepting the Helsinki MoU was a face-saving measure by GAM in the face of military setbacks, Malik said:

:Well, we have to be realistic. We have to take into account the reality on the ground. If that [peace agreement] is a solution that's good for both parties, of course with dignity on both sides, why not! This is for the sake of peace, for the sake of future progress. So, there is nothing wrong with that and I think any other country in the world would do the same thing. And also when we come to that kind of situation we have to be very, very decisive and brave to face reality. And that is what we did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/05/28/malik-mahmud-we-have-be-realistic.html |title=Malik Mahmud: We have to be realistic |newspaper=Jakarta Post |date=28 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603133054/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/05/28/malik-mahmud-we-have-be-realistic.html |archivedate=3 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International pressure ===
The international opinion following the tsunami also had a bearing on the importance placed on the Helsinki peace talks undertaken by both the Indonesian government and GAM. Both sides had sent senior ranking officials as negotiators while during the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (CoHA) talks which was signed in December 2002, representation was at a relatively junior level.

GAM leaders had also assessed during the Helsinki peace talks that there was no support from the international community for Aceh's independence aspiration.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_234&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to this, Malik said:

:We saw also that the world kept silent about our move for independence,  so we thought during the process [of negotiations] that that [autonomy and self-government] was the best solution that was in front of us.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Islam_234/&gt;

In explaining to the GAM commanders the acceptance of self-government instead of continuing to struggle for independence, GAM leaders stressed that if they continued to insist on fighting for independence even after the 2004 tsunami, they would risk being isolated by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2009|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Change in Indonesian leadership ===
In October 2004, President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] (SBY) and Vice-President [[Jusuf Kalla]] were sworn in following the first ever direct [[Indonesian presidential election, 2004|presidential elections in 2004]]. Aspinall argued that before this, there was a balance between those in the Indonesian government who believed that a military victory was impossible and that negotiations were needed and hardliners who held on to the view that GAM could be entirely eliminated—the election of SBY and Kalla had tipped the balance in favour of the former position.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Peace_13-14&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2005|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He pointed out that while SBY was still a minister in the Cabinet of President [[Megawati Soekarnoputri]], he had supported an "integrated approach" in which military measures were accompanied by efforts to negotiate with GAM.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Peace_14&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2005|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalla, then a ministerial colleague of SBY's, also supported the restarting of talks with GAM in early-2004 (a time when the martial law in Aceh was still in effect and the military operation was in full swing).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Aspinall|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Kalla, through his trusted intermediaries, made approaches to GAM's commanders in the field as well as its leadership in Sweden.&lt;ref name=Aspinall_Peace_14/&gt; The positions of both the president and vice-president of Indonesia in favour of negotiations as a solution to the Aceh insurgency thus provided a platform for the eventual success of the Helsinki peace talks.

Kingsbury, an official advisor to GAM, also credited the election of SBY and Kalla in 2004 as providing the impetus for the peace efforts which led to the eventual agreement.&lt;ref name="Kingsbury 2006 15"/&gt; In particular, he pointed out that the appointment of Kalla to oversee the Indonesian delegation for the peace talks was crucial because Kalla's status as the general chairman of [[Golkar]], at that time the largest party in the [[Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat|Indonesian legislature]], allowed SBY's government to deal effectively with any opposition coming from the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kingsbury|2006|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Time To Face The Past'' report ==
In April 2013, Amnesty International released the ''Time To Face The Past'' report in which the organisation states that "most victims and their relatives have long been denied truth, justice and reparation in violation of Indonesia’s obligation under international law. They are still waiting for local and national Indonesian authorities to acknowledge and remedy what happened to them and their loved ones during the conflict." For the formulation of the report, Amnesty International employed the findings that it collected during a visit to Aceh in May 2012. During this visit, organisational representatives spoke with non-governmental organisations (NGOs), community organisations, lawyers, parliamentarians, local government officials, journalists, and victims and their representatives about the situation in Aceh at the time of the interviews. While victims expressed their appreciation of the peace process and the increased security in the Aceh province, they conveyed their frustration at the lack of action from the Indonesian government in regard to the 2005 memorandum of understanding (MOU), in which a plan for the setting up of a Human Rights Court for Aceh and an Aceh Truth and Reconciliation Commission is documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time To Face The Past|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa21/001/2013/en/|work=Amnesty International|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=18 April 2013|format=PDF|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the ''Time To Face The Past'' report contains a warning in light of the potential for renewed violence that exists in Aceh if the Indonesian government remains stagnant in relation to its commitments from the 2005 MOU. Amnesty International's deputy [[Asia-Pacific|Asia Pacific]] director Isabelle Arradon explained during the launch of the report: "The situation is breeding resentment that could sow the seeds of a future return to violence". As of 19 April 2013, the Indonesian government had not issued a response to the report and a presidential spokesman informed the BBC news service that he was unable to comment as he had not read the report.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[File:James Mark Baldwin 1917.jpg|thumb|James Mark Baldwin in 1917]]
'''James Mark Baldwin ''' (January 12, 1861, [[Columbia, South Carolina]] – November 8, 1934, [[Paris]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.distantcousin.com/cemetery/nj/mercer/princetoncem/b.html Archive of Genealogical Data]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.distantcousin.com/cemetery/nj/mercer/princetoncem/_Photo.asp?Photo=790 Princeton Cemetery Gravemarker]&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Americans|American]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[psychology|psychologist]] who was educated at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] under the supervision of Scottish philosopher [[James McCosh]] and who was one of the founders of the [[Princeton University Department of Psychology|Department of Psychology]] at the university. He made important contributions to early [[psychology]], [[psychiatry]], and to the theory of [[evolution]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Baldwin was born and raised in Columbia, South Carolina. His father, who was from Connecticut, was an [[abolitionist]] and was known to purchase slaves in order to free them. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] his father moved north, but the family remained in their home until the time of [[Sherman's March]]. Upon their return after the war, Baldwin's father was part of the [[Reconstruction Era]] government. Baldwin was sent north to receive his secondary education in New Jersey. As a result, he chose to attend the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]).

Baldwin started in theology under the tutelage of the college's president, [[James McCosh]], but soon switched to philosophy. He was awarded the Green Fellowship in Mental Science (named after his future father-in-law, the head of the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]]) and used it to study in Germany with [[Wilhelm Wundt]] at Leipzig and with [[Friedrich Paulsen]] at Berlin (1884–1934).

In 1885 he became Instructor in French and German at the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]]. He translated [[Théodule-Armand Ribot]]'s ''German Psychology of Today'' and wrote his first paper "The Postulates of a Physiological Psychology". Ribot's work traced the origins of psychology from [[Immanuel Kant]] through [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]], [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]], [[Hermann Lotze]] to Wundt.

In 1887, while working as a professor of philosophy at [[Lake Forest College]] he married Helen Hayes Green, the daughter of the President of the Seminary, [[William Henry Green]]. At Lake Forest he published the first part of his ''Handbook of Psychology (Senses and Intellect)'' in which he directed attention to the new experimental psychology of [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]], Fechner and Wundt.

In 1889 he went to the [[University of Toronto]] as the Chair of Logic and Metaphysics. His creation of a laboratory of experimental psychology at Toronto (which he claimed was the first in the [[British Empire]]) coincided with the birth of his daughters Helen (1889) and Elizabeth (1891) which inspired the quantitative and experimental research on [[infant development]] that was to make such a vivid impression on [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] through Baldwin's ''Mental Development in the Child and the Race: Methods and Processes'' (1894) dedicated to the subject.
A second part of ''Handbook of Psychology (Feeling and Will)'' appeared in 1891.

During this creative phase Baldwin traveled to France (1892) to visit the important psychologists [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Charcot]] (at the [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital|Salpêtrière]]), [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] (at Nancy), and [[Pierre Janet]].

===Mid-career===
In 1893 he was called back to his alma mater, [[Princeton University]], where he was offered the Stuart Chair in Psychology and the opportunity to establish a new psychology laboratory. He would stay at Princeton until 1903 working out the highlights of his career reflected in ''Social and Ethical Interpretations in Mental Development: A Study in Social Psychology'' (1897) where he took his previous ''Mental Development'' to the critical stage in which it survived in the work of [[Lev Vygotsky]], through Vygotsky in the crucial work of [[Alexander Luria]], and in the synthesis of both by [[Aleksey Leontyev]]. He also edited the English editions of [[Karl Groos]]'s ''Play of Animals'' (1898) and ''Play of Men'' (1901).

It was during this time that Baldwin wrote "A New Factor of Evolution" (June 1896/''The American Naturalist'') which later became known as the "[[Baldwin Effect]]". But other important contributors should not be overlooked. [[Conwy Lloyd Morgan]] was perhaps closest to understanding the so-called "Baldwin Effect". In his ''Habit and Instinct'' (1896) he phrased a comparable version of the theory, as he did in an address to a session of the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] (February 1896) in the presence of Baldwin. (1896/"Of modification and variation".'' Science'' 4(99) (November 20):733-739). As did [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] (1896/"A mode of evolution requiring neither natural selection nor the inheritance of acquired characteristics". ''Transactions of the New York Academy of Science'' 15:141-148). The "Baldwin Effect", building in part on the principle of "organic selection" proposed by Baldwin in "Mental Development" did only receive its name from [[George Gaylord Simpson]] in 1953. (in: ''Evolution'' 7:110-117) (see: David J. Depew in "Evolution and Learning" M.I.T. 2003)

Baldwin complemented his psychological work with philosophy, in particular [[epistemology]] his contribution to which he presented in the presidential address to the American Psychological Association in 1897. By then the work on the ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'' (1902) had been announced and a period of intense philosophical correspondence ensued with the contributors to the project: [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Josiah Royce]], [[George Edward Moore]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]], [[James McKeen Cattell]], [[Edward B. Titchener]], [[Hugo Münsterberg]], [[Christine Ladd-Franklin]], [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]], [[George Stout]], [[Franklin Henry Giddings]], [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] and others.

In 1899 Baldwin went to Oxford to supervise the completion of the ''Dictionary''... (1902). He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Science at [[Oxford University]]. (In the light of the foregoing, the deafening silence with which J. M. Baldwin was later treated in Oxford publications on the mind may well come to be regarded as one of the significant omissions in the history of ideas for the 20th century. Compare for example [[Richard Gregory]]: ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'', first edition, 1987.)

===Later life===
In 1903, partly as a result of a dispute with Princeton president [[Woodrow Wilson]] and in part due to an offer involving more pay and less teaching, he moved to a professorship of philosophy and psychology at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Here, he re-opened the experimental laboratory that had been founded by [[G. Stanley Hall]] in 1884 (but had closed with Hall's departure to take over the presidency of [[Clark University]] in 1888).

In Baltimore Baldwin started to work on ''Thoughts and Things: A Study of the Development and Meaning of Thought, Or Genetic Logic'' (1906), a densely integrative rendering of his ideas culminating in ''Genetic Theory of Reality: Being the Outcome of Genetic Logic as Issuing in the Aesthetic Theory of Reality called Pancalism'' (1915). This book introduced the concept that knowledge grows through childhood in a series of distinct stages that involve interaction between innate abilities and environmental feedback. He further stated that the initial physical development gives way to language and cognitive abilities such that the child emerges as a result of social and physical growth.

In Baltimore also Baldwin was arrested in a raid on a "colored" brothel (1908), a scandal that put an end to his American career. Forced to leave Johns Hopkins he looked for residence in Paris. He was to reside in France till his death in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Hothersall, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

His first years (1908–1912) in France were interrupted by long stays in [[Mexico]] where he advised on university matters and lectured at the School of Higher Studies at the National University in [[Mexico City]]. His ''Darwin and the Humanities'' (1909) and ''Individual and Society'' (1911) date from this period.
In 1912 he took permanent residence in Paris.

Baldwin's residence in France resulted in his pointing out the urgency of American non-neutral support for his new hosts on the French battlefields of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. He published ''American Neutrality, Its Cause and Cure'' (1916) for the purpose, and when in 1916 he survived a German torpedo attack on the {{ship|SS|Sussex||2}} in the [[English Channel]]&amp;nbsp;– on the return trip from a visit to [[William Osler]] at Oxford&amp;nbsp;– his open telegram to the President of the United States on the affair became frontpage news (''New York Times''). With the entry of America in the war (1917) he helped to organize the Paris branch of the American Navy League, acting as its Chairman till 1922. In 1926 his memoirs ''Between Two Wars (1861-1921)'' were published. He died in Paris on November 8, 1934.

==Ideas==
Baldwin was prominent among early experimental psychologists and was voted by his peers as the fifth most important psychologist in America in a 1903 survey conducted by [[James McKeen Cattell]],&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, J. M. (1933). American Men of Science. New York: Science Press, pp.1277-1278.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was his contributions to [[developmental psychology]] that were the most important. His stepwise theory of cognitive development was a major influence on the later, and much more widely known, developmental theory of [[Jean Piaget]]. Equally important is his contribution to the development of what is currently known as Theory of Mind (ToM).&lt;ref&gt;Obiols JE and Berrios GE (2009): The historical roots of Theory of Mind: the work of James Mark Baldwin ''History of Psychiatry'', 20(3): 377-392&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas on the relationship of Ego and Alter were developed by [[Pierre Janet]];&lt;ref&gt;Henri Ellenberger, ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' (1970), p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; while his stress on how "My sense of self grows by imitation of you...an imitative creation"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ellenberger, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to the [[mirror stage]] of [[Jacques Lacan]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits'' (1997), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

His contributions to the young discipline's early journals and institutions were highly significant as well. Baldwin was a co-founder (with [[James McKeen Cattell]]) of ''[[Psychological Review]]'' (which was founded explicitly to compete with [[G. Stanley Hall]]'s ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]''), ''[[Psychological Monographs]]'' and ''[[Psychological Index]].'' He was also the founding editor of ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]''.

In 1892 he was vice-president of the [[International Congress of Psychology]] held in [[London]], and in 1897–1898 president of the [[American Psychological Association]]; he received a gold medal from the [[Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences of Denmark]] (1897), and was honorary president of the [[International Congress of Criminal Anthropology]] held in [[Geneva]] in 1896.

===Organic selection===
The idea of organic selection came from the interpretation of the observable data in Baldwin's experimental study of infant reaching and its role in [[Developmental disorder|mental development]]. Every practice of the infant's movement intended to advance the integration of [[behavior]] favorable to development in the experimental framework appeared to be selected from an excess of movement in the trial of imitation.

In further stages of development&amp;nbsp;– the ones most critical to an understanding of the evolution of mind&amp;nbsp;– this was graphically illustrated in the child's efforts to draw and learning to write. (''Mental Development in the Child and the Race'')

In later editions of ''Mental Development'' Baldwin changed  the term "''organic'' selection" into "''functional'' selection".

So, from the outset the idea was well linked to the [[philosophy of mind]] Baldwin was emancipating from the models inspired by divine pre-establishment. ([[Spinoza]]) (Wozniak, 2001)

It is the communication of this insight into the practice-related nature of dynamogenic development, above all its integration as a creative factor in the fabric of society, that helped the students of Baldwin to understand what was left of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck's]] signature. Singularly illustrated by [[Gregory Bateson]] in ''Mind and Nature'' (1979) and reintegrated in contemporary studies by [[Terrence Deacon]] (''[[The Symbolic Species]]: The [[co-evolution]] of [[language]] and the [[human brain]]'', 1997) and other scholars of [[biosemiotics]].

In the [[human species]] the faculty of niche building is favored by a practical intelligence able to design the circumstances that will put its vital acquirements out of harm's way in terms of (linearly predicted) [[natural selection]]. It is precisely in the fields of study relating to massive [[selection pressure]]s against which other species seem to be without defenses&amp;nbsp;– biological development in the face of novel [[pandemic]]s ([[AIDS]], [[mad cow disease]])&amp;nbsp;– that the arguments relative to the natural [[heredity]] of intelligent acquirements have resurfaced in a way most challenging to science.

===Baldwin effect===
{{Main|Baldwin effect}}
Baldwin's most important theoretical legacy is the concept of the [[Baldwin effect]] or "Baldwinian evolution". Baldwin proposed, against the [[Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckian]]s of his day (most notably [[Edward Drinker Cope]]), that there is a mechanism whereby [[epigenetic]] factors come to shape the congenital endowment as much as&amp;nbsp;– or more than&amp;nbsp;– [[natural selection]] pressures.  In particular, human behavioral decisions made and sustained across generations as a set of [[culture|cultural]] practices ought to be considered among the factors shaping the human genome.

For example, the [[incest taboo]], if powerfully enforced, removes the natural [[natural selection|selection pressure]] against the possession of incest-favoring instincts. After a few generations without this natural selection pressure, unless such genetic material were profoundly fixed, it would tend to diversify and lose its function. Humans would no longer be innately averse to incest, but would rely on their capacity to internalize such rules from cultural practices.

The opposite case can also be true: cultural practice might [[Artificial selection|selectively breed]] humans to meet the fitness conditions of new environments, cultural and physical, which earlier hominids could not have survived. Baldwinian evolution might strengthen or weaken a genetic trait.

==Influence==
Baldwin's contribution to this field places him at the heart of contemporary controversies in the fields of [[evolutionary psychology]] and wider [[sociobiology]]. Few people did more than Robert Wozniak, Professor of Psychology at [[Bryn Mawr College]], for the rediscovery of the significance of James Mark Baldwin in the [[history of ideas]].

==Work==
Apart from articles in the ''[[Psychological Review]]'', Baldwin wrote:
*''Handbook of Psychology'' (1890), translation of Ribot’s ''German Psychology of To-day'' (1886);
*''Elements of Psychology'' (1893);
*''Social and Ethical Interpretations in Mental Development'' (1898);
*''Story of the Mind'' (1898);
*''Mental Development in the Child and the Race'' (1896);
*''Thought and Things'' ([[London]] and [[New York City|New York]], 1906).

He also largely contributed to the ''[[Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]]'' (1901–1905), of which he was [[editing|editor]] in-chief.

Altogether he has written eight books and is perhaps best known for ''FDR's Folly'', which has been praised by Nobel Laureates [[Milton Friedman]] and [[James M. Buchanan]], [[Harvard]] historian [[David Landes]] and historian [[Thomas Fleming (historian)|Thomas Fleming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/people/jim-powell Cato Institute Resume for Powell]&lt;/ref&gt; Powell's books have been translated into [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

He has contributed several hundred articles for an unusually broad array of publications.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}  He has given talks internationally as well as at [[Harvard]], [[Stanford]] and other universities across the United States.

==Biography==
Powell was born in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] and grew up on [[Long Island]]. His father, Frank Coburn Powell, was a partner in a company that principally manufactured high quality phonograph turntables and cartridges. His mother, Madeline Shields Powell, was a catalog librarian. Both were from Indianapolis. Powell graduated from East Woods School ([[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay, New York]]) and Millbrook School ([[Millbrook, New York]]) before entering the [[University of Chicago]] where he earned a B.A. in history.  His professors included William H. McNeill (''The Rise of the West''), Donald F. Lach (Asia ''in the Making of Europe'') and Earl J. Hamilton (''War and Prices in Spain''). As an editor of the student quarterly ''New Individualist Review'', Powell helped publish articles by future [[Nobel Laureate]]s [[F.A. Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George J. Stigler]]. Other contributors included [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Murray Rothbard]] and [[Yale Brozen]].  Powell worked as a researcher for future Nobel Laureate [[Ronald H. Coase]].

Powell started his career as a direct response advertising copywriter, doing the bulk of his work for financial services companies like [[J.P. Morgan]], [[Merrill Lynch]] and [[GE Capital]]. In 1976, he began freelancing for ''Barron's'', then for other business publications, then publications in the art market and general-interest magazines. Writing for travel magazines took him to Argentina, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, India, Belgium, Switzerland and Dubai.

Powell is a frequent contributor to Forbes Online.  Among topics covered:
* How dictators come to power in a democracy
* Rich nations that went broke by spending too much
* How our friend Iran became our enemy
* The most important secret of a prosperous economy
* Why politicians lose so much money trying to pick winners
* How bad economies recover fast when governments get out of the way
* Two of the all-time greatest successes in cutting taxes and spending
* Why wars often go wrong
* Global oil and gas markets, our best energy security
* Why soak-the-rich taxes end up soaking everyone
* How entrepreneurs created the great boom that made modern Japan
* An amazing command of the obvious
* Why there's no human progress without capitalism

Powell's early books were about the art market, commercial real estate and Japanese finance. By the late 1980s, Powell began to author books on liberty.

== Biography ==
Lucila Luciani Eduardo was born on 21 January 1882 in [[Maracaibo]], [[Zulia]], Venezuela to Juan Nepomuceno Luciani and Casimira Eduardo.{{sfn|Hilton|1951|p=138}}&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fuguet Borregales|first1=Eumenes|title=Lucila Luciani de Pérez, Primera mujer en la Academia Nacional de la Historia|url=http://venelib-antao.blogspot.mx/2010/01/lucila-luciani-de-perez-primera-mujer.html|publisher=Venezuela de Antaño|accessdate=18 September 2015|location=Venezuela|language=Spanish|date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated in Venezuela, the United States and France,{{sfn|Hilton|1951|p=138}} and studied piano and violin with renowned instructors like Ramón Delgado Palacios. She performed abroad at both private and public concerts, returning in 1909 to Venezuela and marrying the pioneering dermatologist, Manuel Pérez Díaz (1872–1931),&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; with whom she had eight children.{{sfn|Hilton|1951|p=138}}

Luciani began her career writing historical and feminist articles, literary critiques and essays for journals{{sfn|Hilton|1951|p=138}} and newspapers&lt;ref name="photo and press release"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Woman’s Party Photograph Collection|url=http://sewallbelmont.pastperfect-online.com/36836cgi/mweb.exe?request=record&amp;id=850991FA-AA9B-447F-B3C7-342227940720&amp;type=102|publisher=Sewall-Belmont House &amp; Museum|accessdate=18 September 2015|location=Washington, DC|date=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; She published several short stories,&lt;ref name=CIM&gt;{{cite news|last1=Little|first1=Herbert|title=Seek to Free Women from Unjust Laws|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3246223/the_daily_republican/|accessdate=18 September 2015|agency=UP|publisher=The Daily Republican|date=4 August 1928|location=Rushville, Indiana|page=3|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1919, she published her first book, ''La batalla de Boyacá: su importancia militar y política'',{{sfn|Pacheco|Barrera Linares|González Stephan|2006|p=555}} which won the award of the Academy of History of Venezuela in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="photo and press release" /&gt;

In 1928, when the [[Inter-American Commission of Women]] (CIM) was founded, Luciani was designated as one of the inaugural members.&lt;ref name=CIM /&gt; [[Doris Stevens]], who had suggested the commission to investigate the disparity of laws effecting women throughout the Americas, was appointed as chair and the other six countries were selected by lot. The chosen countries were Argentina, Colombia, El Salvador, Haiti, Panama, and Venezuela and the appointed delegates were Dr. [[Ernestina A. López]] de Nelson from Argentina, [[María Elena de Hinestrosa]] from Colombia, [[María Alvárez de Guillén Rivas]] from El Salvador, [[Alice Téligny Mathon]] from Haiti, [[Clara González]] from Panama and Luciani from Venezuela.{{sfn|Lee|Cohen|2004|pp=225-227}} That same year, she began publishing ''Iris: revista de acción social'' and remained as its director until 1941. The magazine was published in conjunction with the Unión de Damas de la Acción Católica,&lt;ref name=Iris&gt;{{cite web|title=Iris: revista de acción social|url=http://sisbiv.bnv.gob.ve/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=215151|publisher=Biblioteca Nacional de Venezuela|accessdate=18 September 2015|location=Caracas, Venezuela}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Union of Catholic Women of Action) of which Luciani was founder and first president,{{sfn|Hilton|1951|p=138}} but was a feminist journal.{{sfn|Lee|Cohen|2004|p=226}}

When her husband died in 1931, Luciani became sole support of her large family and began teaching.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; Between 1934 and 1935 she taught at the Escuela Normal para Mujeres (Female Teacher's Normal School){{sfn|Hilton|1951|p=138}} and in 1936 became its first female Director.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; That same year, she also served as the Director of the Colegio Cháves{{sfn|Hilton|1951|p=138}} and worked as a librarian at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; In 1939{{sfn|Hilton|1951|p=138}} she became the Deputy Director of the Biblioteca Nacional ([[National Library of Venezuela|National Library]]) and in 1940, she was awarded the first chair (number 10) ever given to a woman at the National Academy of History.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;{{sfn|Pacheco|Barrera Linares|González Stephan|2006|p=555}}

She represented Venezuela in several international conferences. Besides her travel and research work with the CIM,&lt;ref name="photo and press release" /&gt; Luciani attended the International Congress of the Union of Catholic Women held in Santiago, Chile in 1936.{{sfn|Hilton|1951|p=138}} In 1941, she was appointed as the first female President of Venezuela's Catholic Conference&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; and in 1945, she served in Venezuela's delegation to the conference in [[San Francisco]] which resulted in the founding of the [[United Nations]].{{sfn|Hilton|1951|p=138}}

The '''McClelland sherd''', '''Tell Jisr sherd''' or '''El-Jisr sherd''' is a fragment of [[pottery]] discovered by McClelland at [[Tell Jisr]], near [[Rashaya]] in [[Lebanon]] and first studied by [[George E. Mendenhall]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Mendenhall, George E.,  A New Chapter in the History of the Alphabet, Bulletin du Musee de Beyrouth 24, 13-19, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ostracon]] displays a series of incisions in the pottery that have been suggested to be an early type of [[Bronze Age]] [[writing]].&lt;ref name="biblicooriente1975"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pontificio Istituto biblico|author2=Pontificio Istituto biblico.

It has not been reliably dated however suggestions have been made of c. 1800 [[Before Christ|BC]] or earlier. It has a double rope moulding that is similar to other Middle Bronze Age pottery from the [[Euphrates]] valley area of [[Syria]]. Dr. Cherie J. Lenzen has also suggested similar features were noted on pottery found at [[Tell Irbid]] in northern [[Jordan]]. Despite calls for dismissal or denial of the sherd as a "by-form" of the alphabet by [[Frank M. Cross]],&lt;ref name="Cross1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Moore Cross|title=Early alphabetic scripts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5DdaQwAACAAJ|accessdate=31 March 2011|date=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendenhall has said that the sherd ''"clearly exhibits both the ''dâl'' and the ''thâ'' of later Eastern alphabets"''. He states ''"the sherd is perhaps older than any other [[alphabetic]] inscription so far discovered"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiys.org/webdate/mend.html Mendenhall, George E., The Northern Origins of Old South Arabic Literacy, The University of Michigan and Yarmouk University, Yemen Update 33:15-19  (1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Moseley Royal Commission''', officially titled the '''''Royal Commission Appointed to Investigate, Report and Advise Upon Matters in Relation to the Condition and Treatment of Aborigines''''' was a [[Royal Commission]] established by the [[Government of Western Australia]] in 1934 to hear evidence regarding the treatment of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37714481 |title=With the Aborigines Commission in the North. |newspaper=[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|Western Mail]] |location=Perth |date=12 July 1934 |accessdate=19 January 2013 |page=2 Supplement: Regular supplement – 'Pictorial section' |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A. O. Neville==
The Royal Commission was to examine proposals to extend the powers of [[A. O. Neville]], the "[[Protector of Aborigines|Chief Protector of Aborigines]]", and the social policy of removal of children from their parents. Agitation by critics and the resulting media coverage in London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32862235 | title=Commissioner's Report. | via=National Library of Australia | date=27 June 1935 | accessdate=19 January 2013 | newspaper=[[The West Australian]] | location=Perth | page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and locally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32807062 | title=Welfare of Aborigines. | via=National Library of Australia | date=17 October 1934 | accessdate=19 January 2013 | newspaper=[[The West Australian]] | location=Perth | page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; had brought attention to the Native Administration Act 1905–1936 (WA) Amendment(1911) and to actions by Neville.

A series of submissions detailing accusations of child slavery, abuse and mistreatment and the evidence was given by mothers of the removed children. The commission produced a report citing problems with the policy, but concluding to continue with the recommendations of Neville.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Western Australia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20322">[[Nineteenth-century theatre|Theatre in the nineteenth century]] was noted for its changing philosophy from the [[Romanticism]] and [[Neoclassicism]] that dominated Europe since the late 18th century to [[Realism (theatre)|Realism]] and [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] in the latter half of the 19th century before it eventually gave way to the rise of [[Modernism]] in the 20th century. Scenery in theater at the time closely mirrored these changes and, with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and technological advancement throughout the century, dramatically changed the aesthetics of the theater.

==Realism==
[[Theatrical realism]] was a general movement in 19th-century theatre from the time period of 1870-1960 that developed a set of dramatic and theatrical conventions with the aim of bringing a greater fidelity of real life to texts and performances. Part of a broader artistic movement, it included a focus on everyday middle-class drama, ordinary speech, and simple settings. This idea of representing subject matter truthfully, was evident in the changes that were made to scenic design in theater. Theatrical designers and directors began meticulously researching historical accuracy for their productions, which meant that scenery could no longer be drawn from stock - which was typically used over and over again in generic settings for different shows. [[Scenery]] began to be custom-designed and made for specific production. This meant, while scenery used to be seen as capital investment, it was not considered to be more disposable when the production was removed from the repertory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baugh|first1=Christopher|title=Theatre, Performance and Technology|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave MacMillion|pages=11–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenic Innovation==
One of the most important scenic transition into the century was from the often-used two-dimensional scenic backdrop to three-dimensional sets. Previously, as a two-dimensional environment, scenery did not provide an embracing, physical environment for the dramatic action happening on stage. This changed when three-dimensional sets were introduced in the first half of the century. This, coupled with change in audience and stage dynamic as well as advancement in theater architecture that allowed for hidden scene changes, the theater became more representational instead of presentational, and invited audience to be transported to a conceived 'other' world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baugh|first1=Christopher|title=Theatre, Performance and Technology|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave MacMillion|pages=11–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The epitome of the new three-dimensional style sets and one of the most important advancement of scenic design was the popularization of the [[Box set (theatre)|box set]]. The box set has been around since the 17th century, but lacked support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brockett|first1=Oscar|last2=Mitchell|first2=Margaret|last3=Hardberger|first3=Linda|title=Making the Scene: A History of Stage Design and Technology in Europe and the United States|date=2010|publisher=Tobin Theatre Arts Fund|location=San Antonio, TX|pages=157–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] had introduced realistic stage furnishing in 1836 at her little Olympic Theatre in London, and forced them on American managers when she toured that country in 1838-1839.&lt;ref&gt;Taubman, Howard. The making of American theatre. New York: Coward McCann Inc., 196, pg 140&lt;/ref&gt; The box set was a gradual replacement of the painted wing-and-shutter sets. Between 1800 and 1875, many theater artists began to use them. A box set consists of flats hinged together to represent a room; it often has practicable elements, such as doors and windows, which can be used during the course of a play or show.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ben. THEATER IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. &lt;http://homepage.smc.edu/martin_ben/TheaterHistory/nineteenth.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; With the new pursuit of realism, room-like box settings now had heavy molding, real doors with doorknobs, and ample accurate furniture. Having the box set also meant that many theater artists began to stage all the action behind the proscenium in the late 1800s, thus reinforcing the illusion of a [[fourth wall]]. Audiences would be watching a “[[slice of life]]” through a window. Box sets allowed scenic designers to create better visualized atmospheres and moods.

==Aesthetic Style==
19th-century scenic styles in America were unique derivations from the European masters. Scenic artists from Europe brought with them the [[Romanticism|Romantic]], [[Baroque]], or classical landscapes that they knew from their homes, but the styles seemed to change when they landed on the American shore.&lt;ref&gt;Beuder, Susan Crabtree &amp; Peter. Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools, and Techniques. Ed. Taylor &amp; Francis. Illustrated. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The romantic English landscape painting style slowly adapted to the American image. The more rugged wild-western American landscape came to be idealized by native scenic artists throughout the century. Many theatres invested in generic scenery meant for virtually any production. An all-purpose set included landscapes, European cities, prison, palace, village, mountain pass, and forest.&lt;ref&gt;Beuder, Susan Crabtree &amp; Peter. Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools, and Techniques. Ed. Taylor &amp; Francis. Illustrated. 2005, pg 415&lt;/ref&gt;

The oleo was a versatile drop for any sort of entertainment. The oleo drop often hung in the in-one position, subdividing the stage into a shallower depth that was more appropriate for a brief interlude.&lt;ref&gt;Beuder, Susan Crabtree &amp; Peter. Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools, and Techniques. Ed. Taylor &amp; Francis. Illustrated. 2005, pg 415&lt;/ref&gt; The act curtain or drop curtain functioned as today's main drape, the decorative divider wall between audience and stage. Often, it was the most elaborate piece a theater owned and was painted to harmonize with the interior decorations of the theater itself.

==Technological Advancement==
During the nineteenth century, the technology of the [[industrial revolution]] was applied to theater.  Many historians believe that the popularity of [[melodrama]], with its emphasis on stage spectacle and special effects, accelerated these technological innovations: For example, [[Dion Boucicault]] was responsible for the introduction of fireproofing in the theater when one of his melodramatic plays called for an onstage fire.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ben. THEATER IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. &lt;http://homepage.smc.edu/martin_ben/TheaterHistory/nineteenth.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panorama===
While the invention of the [[panorama]] is attributed to [[Robert Barker (painter)|Robert Barker]] in 1787, [[Louis Jacques Daguerre]] is largely seen as having perfected the invention in the 19th century. He created the diorama: a still painting viewed by an audience sitting on a rotating platform. This soon gave way to the moving panorama: a setting painted on a long cloth, which could be unrolled across the stage by turning spools, created an illusion of movement and changing locales. A popular American play, [[William Dunlap]]'s ''A Trip to Niagara'' (1828), used this device to show a voyage from New York City to Niagara Falls via a steamboat.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ben. THEATER IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. &lt;http://homepage.smc.edu/martin_ben/TheaterHistory/nineteenth.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of the panoramas coupled with [[Charles Kean]]’s invention of the Corsican trap meant that entire horse and chariots races could be enacted on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Jack|last2=Fletcher Kernie|first2=Grant|title=A Cultural History of Theatre|date=1993|publisher=Longman|location=New York|pages=288–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on recreating natural environments onstage was probably influenced by romanticism, which called for a "return to nature." 
 
[[File:Elevator Stage.jpg|thumbnail|right|THE MOVABLE STAGE AT MADISON SQUARE THEATER, NEW YORK]]

===Elevator Stage===
On February 7, 1880, The Spirit of the Times announced: "Tonight Mr. J. Steele MacKaye will open the most exquisite theatre in the world, and all New York will assemble to do honor to the realization of his artistic visions…Mr. MacKaye will play the drama ''Hazel Kirke'' through with only two-minute waits between the acts, and will then exhibit the double stage—one compartment set for the kitchen of Blackburn Mill and other as boudoir at Fairy Grove Villa." MacKaye’s elevator stage was an important development of American drama and theatre. It was a solution to the problem posed by the increasing use of box sets to reproduce interior scenes in detail. With the elevator stage, multiple scenes could be changed in a fast and detailed way. This greatly improved the speed and efficiency of scenic changes, and that design didn’t have to be simplified, they could still be detailed. 
The elevator stage was described in ''[[Scientific American]]'', April 5, 1884.
"[It consists] of two theatrical stages, one above another, to be moved up and down as an elevator car is operated in a high building, and so that either one of them can easily and quickly be at any time brought to the proper level for acting thereon in front of the auditorium. While the play is proceeding before the audience, the assistants arrange another scene on the upper stage."&lt;ref&gt;French, Glenn Hughes &amp; Samuel. A history of the American theatre. Binghamton: Vail Ballot Press Inc., 1951, pg.234-236&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edwin Booth Theatre===
New styles of scenery meant that new means of scene shifting were needed. [[Booth's Theatre]], opened in 1869, was the first in a new generation of theaters built specifically to suit three-dimensional set pieces. It was the first theater to have a level stage floor (rather than a raked floor, as had been the standard in proscenium-arch theaters since the Renaissance) and no grooves in the stage floor for shifting flats. This idea would become the standard by the end of the century. Elevators and equipment for flying scenery also complemented the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brockett|first1=Oscar|last2=Mitchell|first2=Margaret|last3=Hardberger|first3=Linda|title=Making the Scene: A History of Stage Design and Technology in Europe and the United States|date=2010|publisher=Tobin Theatre Arts Fund|location=San Antonio, TX|pages=157–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage Lighting===
Nineteenth-century technology revolutionized stage lighting, which until then had been primitive. The introduction of [[gas lighting]] was the first step. In 1816, Philadelphia's Chestnut Street Theater became the earliest gas-lit playhouse in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Barnard. Theatre U.S.A. 1655-1957. University of Illinois: McGraw Hill Book Company, 1959, pg 105&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of gas lighting revolutionized stage lighting. It provided a somewhat more natural and adequate light for the playing and the scenic space upstage of the proscenium arch. However, this new richness in lighting provided difficulties at first. Though scenic painters had to learn to subdue their colors to the increased candle-power, the brightness only further highlight the disparity between three-dimensional set pieces and their two-dimensional backdrop and led to the latter's eventual decline. 
The advent of [[limelight]], also known as [[Drummond light]], also effectively introduced [[spotlighting]] to theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Jack|last2=Fletcher Kernie|first2=Grant|title=A Cultural History of Theatre|date=1993|publisher=Longman|location=New York|pages=288–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Edison]]'s electric incandescent lamp, invented in 1879, was the next step. It made electricity the most flexible, most controllable, and safest form of lighting, in the twentieth century, it would make stage lighting design a true art. These new means of illumination tremendously increased the control over stage light and stimulated interest in imitating lighting phenomena of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Barnard. Theatre U.S.A. 1655-1957. University of Illinois: McGraw Hill Book Company, 1959, pg 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noted Designers, Artists, and Technologists==

It was during this time that scenic artist began to be recognized for their work. Many of the scenic artists operated their own scenic studios in New York and towards the latter half of the century, the first theatrical unions were formed as a response to the [[Theatrical Syndicate|Theatre Syndicate]]. Producing who originally hired staff carpenters and company painters began to place their productions out to bid. It was also during this time period that designers began working with models to convey their design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larson|first1=Orville|title=Scene Design in the American Theatre from 1915 to 1960|date=1989|publisher=U of Arkansas|location=Fayetteville|pages=3–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*'''[[Steele MacKaye]]''' (1842-1894) was an innovative theater technologist who invented the elevator stage. In 1880, at the Madison Square Theater in New York, Mackaye used two stages: one above the other, which could be raised and lowered; while one stage was in view of the audience, the scenery on the other, which was either in the basement or in the fly area, could be changed.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Barnard. Theatre U.S.A. 1655-1957. University of Illinois: McGraw Hill Book Company, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[David Belasco]]''' (1853-1931) was an American producer, director and playwright, Mr. Belasco is primarily remembered today for his emphasis on naturalistic detail. David Belasco is best known for his ultra-realistic melodramas of the turn of the century. He and his chief scenic artist, George Gros, created meticulously detailed interiors, realistic exteriors, and stunning atmospheric effects.&lt;ref&gt;Beuder, Susan Crabtree &amp; Peter. Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools, and Techniques. Ed. Taylor &amp; Francis. Illustrated. 2005, pg.415&lt;/ref&gt; Belasco and Gros produced some of the most memorable scenic inventions of the American theatre and certainly some of the finest realistic scenery of the theatre history. His laborious scenic and lighting techniques were seen by the avant-garde as the embodiment of every ill of the stage and were severely ridiculed by history. In 1909, for a production of ''The Easiest Way'', his scenic artist placed the contents of a boarding house room, including the wallpaper, on the stage of the Stuyvesant Theatre and three years later (1912) he built on stage a fully functioning restaurant for the ''Governor's Lady''.&lt;ref&gt;Wild, Larry. A Brief History of Theatrical Scenery. 18 February 2002. 23 February 2006 &lt;http://www3.northern.edu/wild/ScDes/sdhist.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Alfred Roller Goethe's Faust.jpg|thumbnail|right|Alfred Roller, Before a Palace, for Goethe's Faust, Part II, Act V, Scene 17, 1911, Pen and black ink, watercolor and gouache, on paper]]
*'''[[Alfred Roller]]''' (1864-1935) was trained as a painter in Vienna, but his designs hinted at a new concept of scenic design.&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, Edwin Mims Jr. &amp; Oral. The Pageant of America- the American stage. Yale University Press, 1929, pg 338&lt;/ref&gt; Focused entirely on the interplay of light and color to create evocative stage spaces. Roller’s designs relied on a selected or simplified realism in which only few items were introduced to the stage, but each of them evocative, detailed and powerful. He utilized mobile scenic towers that could be rearranged and altered with light to form new shapes and movement patterns on the stage (Sumner 338). He was probably the earliest designer to embody and practice the ideas of Adolph Appia and Edward Gordon Craig.
*'''Charles Witham''' (1842-1926) was born in Portland, Maine and educated as an artist. He spent some time as an itinerant landscapist before becoming involved with the theater. Thanks to the friendship of Gaspard Maeder, Witham obtained his first theatre job as Maeder's assistant when the latter was chief designer for [[Niblo's Garden|Niblo’s Garden]] in New York in the early 1860s. By 1863, Witham had become head designer for the Boston Theater where he painted scenery for Edwin Forrest. His stay in Boston was short because he was hired by [[Edwin Booth]] to join his staff as scenic artist. He would go on to be Booth's primary designer for years to come. His collection of work remains the largest surviving theater scenic art from the time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larson|first1=Orville|title=Scene Design in the American Theatre from 1915 to 1960|date=1989|publisher=U of Arkansas|location=Fayetteville|pages=3–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Plays==
 [[File:Under the Gaslight Scene.jpeg|thumbnail|right|Scene from Daly's ''[[Under the Gaslight]]'' (1867)]]
*[[Under the Gaslight]] (1867), was one of the first of many plays to use a steam engine onstage while the hero was being tied to the railway tracks. “Despite the fact that, on the first night, the machinery of the great railroad scene failed to work properly, the audience was held in tense excitement, and the play from the outset was a success” It ran for 110 performances.&lt;ref&gt;French, Glenn Hughes &amp; Samuel. A history of the American theatre. Binghamton: Vail Ballot Press Inc., 1951, pg 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanical effects involved are said to have been patented by [[Augustin Daly]].
[[File:Crookfinale.jpg|thumbnail|left|Poster of musical theatre The Black Crook, representing the finale in which the amazons crush the forces of evil.]]
*There were many thrills in ''[[The Black Crook]]'' (1866), but the greatest of them was the corps de ballet and the hundred of costumes. After the premier, which lasted from 7:45pm till 1:15am, the Tribune reported that “The Scenery is magnificent; the ballet is beautiful; the drama is—rubbish…the last scene in the play, however, will dazzle and impress to even a greater degree, by its lavish richness and barbaric splendor. All that gold and silver, and gems and light, and woman’s beauty can contribute to fascinate the eye and charm the sense.&lt;ref&gt;French, Glenn Hughes &amp; Samuel. A history of the American theatre. Binghamton: Vail Ballot Press Inc., 1951, pg 199&lt;/ref&gt; The best exhibited scenery piece is the one that closes the second act. A vast grotto extending into an almost measureless perspective. Stalactites descend from the arched roof. A tranquil and lovely lake reflects the golden glories that span it like a vast sky. In every direction one sees the bright sheen or the dull richness of massy gold. Beautiful fairies and sprites make the scene luxuriant.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Barnard. Theatre U.S.A. 1655-1957. University of Illinois: McGraw Hill Book Company, 1959, pg 196.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Poor of New York]]'' (1899), scenically displaying such contrasts and spectacles as a rich home in Madison Square, a tenement house in Cross Street, with a fire, a bank in Nassau Street, and a snow storm in Union Square&lt;ref&gt;French, Glenn Hughes &amp; Samuel. A history of the American theatre. Binghamton: Vail Ballot Press Inc., 1951, pg 187,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The end of the 19th century witnessed both the height and the end of scenery painted in traditional perspective. Scenic design was realistic and creative that released the audience’s imagination. Realism was but a passing style. Towards the end of the century, realism would find an opposite in naturalism. [[Adolphe Appia]] and [[Edward Gordon Craig]] would be the ones to revolt against the idea of the actor standing on a flat floor surrounded by “realistic” painted canvases. Their controversial ideas would be the basis of the New Stagecraft. The 20th century would bring the scenic designer an entirely new aesthetic for the world of the theatre in the form of [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Modernism]]. As movies replaced theatre’s popularity, an international aesthetic weighed in against painted scenery, scenic studios began to shrink, and scenic artists began to disappear. The golden age of scenic painting of the 19th century rapidly turned to a much more fragmented one in 20th century, as theatre styles changed radically and eventually the theatre lost popularity to movies and television.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1852">'''Oakland Heritage Alliance''' (OHA) is an American [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Oakland, California]]. OHA advocates the protection, preservation, and revitalization of Oakland's architectural, historic, cultural and natural resources through [[publication]]s, [[education]], and [[direct action]].

OHA began in 1980 with a bankroll of $150 and seven individuals who loved the city's history. Founding members came from a core of those involved in the [[Oakland Cultural Heritage Survey]] which was funded by a 1979 state grant.

OHA activities:

*Partners in Preservation awards are given to encourage organizations and individuals to restore and revitalize Oakland’s historic homes, buildings, structures, and neighborhoods and to support sensitive adaptive use.
*[[Walking tour]]s concentrate on a single neighborhood at a time and are open to both OHA members and the public on a [[Sliding scale fees|sliding scale fee]]. Most walking tours take place on Saturdays and Sundays in the summer. 
*Open house tours are similar to walking tours but offer the chance to see inside a handful of private homes each of which exemplify a particular architectural style common to the tour's focus. 
*Participation at the city government level to promote preservation.
*Oakland Heritage Alliance publishes a quarterly [[newsletter]]: OHA News.

Membership is open to any interested party.

'''Occasional poetry''' is [[poetry]] composed for a particular occasion. In the [[history of literature]], it is often studied in connection with [[orality]], [[performance]], and [[patronage]]. 

==Term==
As a term of [[literary criticism]], "occasional poetry" describes the work's purpose and the poet's relation to subject matter. It is not a [[genre]], but several genres originate as occasional poetry, including [[Epithalamium|epithalamia]] (wedding songs), [[dirge]]s or funerary poems, [[paean]]s, and [[epinikion|victory odes]]. Occasional poems may also be composed exclusive of or within any given set of genre conventions to commemorate single events or anniversaries, such as birthdays, foundings, or dedications.

Occasional poetry is often [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] because it originates as performance, in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] and into the 16th century even with musical accompaniment; at the same time, because performance implies an audience, its communal or public nature can place it in contrast with the intimacy or personal expression of [[emotion]] often associated with the term "lyric".&lt;ref&gt;Marian Zwerling Sugano, ''The Poetics of the Occasion'' (Stanford University Press, 1992), p. 5. For an example of literary criticism contrasting public occasional poetry with "more intimate … lyric," see Nanora Sweet and Julie Melnyk, ''Felicia Hemans: Reimagining Poetry in the 19th Century'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2001), p. 5 [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgfoEXgOMJ8C&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=%22occasional+poetry%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1946&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#PPA5,M1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasional poetry was a significant and even characteristic form of expression in [[ancient Greek literature|ancient Greek]] and [[Roman literature|Roman culture]], and has continued to play a prominent if sometimes aesthetically debased role throughout Western literature. Poets whose body of work features occasional poetry that stands among their highest literary achievements include [[Pindar]], [[Horace]], [[Ronsard]], [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]], [[John Dryden|Dryden]], [[John Milton|Milton]], [[Goethe]], [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]], and [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]].&lt;ref&gt;Sugano, ''The Poetics of the Occasion'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, particularly in Germany, occasional poems were often written by women, a phenomenon that has been the subject of [[feminist literary criticism]]. The occasional poem ([[French language|French]] ''pièce d'occasion'', [[German language|German]] ''Gelegenheitsgedichte'') is also important in [[Persian literature|Persian]], [[Arabic literature|Arabic]], [[Chinese literature|Chinese]], and [[Japanese literature]], and its ubiquity among virtually all [[world literature]]s suggests the centrality of occasional poetry in the origin and development of poetry as an [[art]] form.

[[Goethe]] declared that "Occasional Poetry is the highest kind,"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by David Herd, ''[[John Ashbery]] and American Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2000), p. 54 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xbeFAO7jYD8C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=%22Occasional+Poetry+is+the+highest+kind%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] gave it a central place in the philosophical examination of how poetry interacts with life:

{{cquote|Poetry's living connection with the real world and its occurrences in public and private affairs is revealed most amply in the so-called ''pièces d'occasion''. If this description were given a wider sense, we could use it as a name for nearly all poetic works: but if we take it in the proper and narrower sense we have to restrict it to productions owing their origin to some single present event and expressly devoted to its exaltation, embellishment, commemoration, etc. But by such entanglement with life poetry seems again to fall into a position of dependence, and for this reason it has often been proposed to assign the whole sphere of ''pièces d'occasion'' an inferior value although to some extent, especially in [[lyric poetry]], the most famous works belong to this class."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hegel]] as quoted by Sugano, ''The Poetics of the Occasion'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 19th and 20th centuries, newspapers in the United States often published occasional poems, and memorial poems for floods, train accidents, mine disasters and the like were frequently written as lyrics in ballad stanzas.{{Fact|date=June 2009}}

A high-profile example of a 21st century occasional poem is [[Elizabeth Alexander (poet)|Elizabeth Alexander]]'s "[[Praise Song for the Day]]," written for [[Barack Obama]]'s 2009 [[United States presidential inauguration|US presidential inauguration]], and read by the poet during the event to a television audience of around 38 million.&lt;ref&gt;The audience for the televised inauguration averaged 37.8 million people; see [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|Inauguration of Barack Obama: Television audience]]. The decision to include a poet was covered by media not normally devoted to contemporary poetry; background at [[Elizabeth Alexander (poet)#2009 U.S. Presidential inauguration|Elizabeth Alexander]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13935">'''Riccobaldo of Ferrara''' (1246- after  1320) was a medieval Italian notary and Latin writer of the Middle Ages, a chronicler, geographer and encyclopedist. He is sometimes known in the literature as ''Riccobaldo da Ferrara'' according to the Italian form, or as ''Riccobaldo Ferrarese'' or as ''Riccolbaldo''

== Life ==
He was born in Ferrara or in the surrounding area, most probably in 1246, his father being one  Bonmercato. On  4 October 1251, as a ''puer'' (''boy''), he was a witness to the passage through Ferrara of [[Pope Innocent IV]]; on  17 February 1264, as an ''adulescens'' (''adolescent''), he was present during the  funeral at Ferrara of [[Azzo VII d'Este]]; he appeared as a witness to a statute of Ferrara of 15 December 1274; in May 1282 he was to be found at [[Faenza]]; in 1290 he applied his seal to three documents at [[Reggio Emilia]], where he served as notary to the vicar (deputy) of [[Obizzo II d'Este]], the city’s ''podestà''. He is known to have been at [[Padua]] in  1293, at  [[Ravenna]] in  1297-1300, exercising his  profession at  Ferrara in  1308, once again in Padua at unspecified period between 1308 and  1313, and at  Ferrara in  1310. He died some time after 1318.

The claims that his  real name was  Gervasio (Gervase), that he belonged to the Mainardi family, and that he was for a time  a canon in Ravenna, are doubtless products of somewhat approximate sixteenth- and seventeenth-century scholarship. One thing that is certain, because he himself says us so, is that he bore the titles of ''dominus'' ("lord") and ''magister'' ("master"). Since Riccobaldo refers to himself as an ''exile'', attempts have been made to see such an exile as a result of Riccobaldo's lending his support to [[Aldobrandino II d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara|Aldobrandino II]] in the latter’s clash with his brother [[Azzo VIII d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara|Azzo VIII]], Lord of  Ferrara. However, this hypothesis has to date found no evidence to back it up. That he had no love for the [[House of Este|Este]] family can easily be seen in some of his works, but it is not discernible in others, and so important questions remain unclear. As remarked, Riccobaldo was notary to the vicar (deputy) of [[Obizzo II d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara|Obizzo II d'Este]] and in Ravenna he appears to have lived in the shadow of [[Obizzo Sanvitale]], [[Archdiocese of Ravenna|Archbishop of Ravenna]], a known supporter of the [[House of Este|Este]] family. Yet in 1308 Riccobaldo can be found in [[Ferrara]], swearing fidelity to the Church of Rome immediately after the expulsion of the [[House of Este|Este]] family from the lordship of the city. What should be made of these apparent contradictions.

Riccobaldo  witnessed, at times at very close quarters, the  political events in  his city,  and was sometimes a witness, too, of  what happened in the history of Italy as a whole, even in works of his that were not strictly historical, but more of a  geographical character.

As to Riccobaldo‘s  own  cultural story, this is in part fairly clearly established, though in some respects it has not yet been investigated, even if considerable research is underway. Only recently  has it been possible to attribute to him a political "carmen" (song)  in Latin which celebrates the newly acquired freedom of his city,   Ferrara. In this text there are obvious  citations of various earlier Latin  lyrics, a fact that shows a considerable personal culture for the period.  While the lyrics passed off in the seventeenth century as Riccobaldo‘s  by  Girolamo Baruffaldi are certainly not genuine, we still need once more to take into consideration the fact that he had the title of  ''magister'' ("master") and that phrase of his in his old age where  Riccobaldo says he is now  dedicated  ''melioribus studiis'' ("to the better kind of study" or "to  better pursuits").

==Riccobaldo's Reading==
By his own explicit admission, his first  impulse to write came from his  contact with the  archives firstly of  [[Nonantola]] and then of [[Ravenna]]. In Ravenna he came to know, as he himself recounts, the  ''[[Cronaca di Eusebio|Chronicon]]'', that is to say the  ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' of  [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], in the  ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' (''Chronicle'') of Saint [[Jerome]], and in  all probability also the so-called ''[[Ravenna Cosmography]]''; at  [[Nonantola]] he certainly had access to the  sequel to Jerome’s work, written this time by Saint [[Prosper of Aquitaine]].

Among the numerous works he knew were the dictionary ''[[Elementarium doctrinae rudimentum]]'' of  [[Papias (lexicographer)|Papias]], the short  ''Chronicon'' of  Saint [[Isidore of Seville]] (attributed by Riccobaldo  to a bishop Miletus; then some decades of [[Livy]]’s   ‘’[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy) )|Ab Urbe Condita]]" (History of Rome);  the ''Historiae adversus paganos'' (''Histories against the Pagans'') of [[Orosius|Paulus Orosius]], the great  encyclopedic work by Marziano Capella entitled ''[[Itinerarium Antonini]]'', [[Pliny the Elder]]’s  ''Naturalis historia'' (''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''), the  ''[[Collectanea rerum memorabilium]]'' (''Collection of Curiosities'') of [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]], the  work of compilation by  the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Martin of Opava]], which Riccobaldo cites as the  ''Martiniana'',  parts  of the  ''Legenda aurea'' (''[[Golden Legend]]'') by [[Jacobus de Voragine]], the  version of  [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] drawn up by  [[Paul the Deacon]] and the ''Historia Langobardorum'' (''[[History of the Lombards]]''), the abbreviated version of the ''Philippic Histories'' of [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] or Pompey Trogue composed  by  [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], [[Florus]], the  ''Pharsalia'' of [[Lucan]], something of the writings of  [[Seneca the Younger]] (certainly including the  ''[[Seneca's Consolations|De consolatione ad Helviam]]'' and ''[[De clementia]]'' (''On Clemency''), [[Suetonius]]’s ''Vitae Caesarum'' (''[[The Twelve Caesars|Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]''), the ''Navigatio Sancti Brendani'' (''The Sea Voyage of St [[Brendan]]''), [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]’s   commentary on the [[Aeneid]], works of [[Pomponius Mela]], the Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle ''([[Historia Caroli Magni]]'', the ''[[Historia scholastica]]'' by [[Peter Comestor]] (a biblical paraphrase written in  Latin), [[Boethius]]'s ''De consolatione philosophiae'' ''([[The Consolation of Philosophy]])'', [[Juvenal]], the Latin translation by  [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus of Aquileia]] of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]’s ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', [[Andreas Agnellus|Agnellus of Ravenna]].

After this  the list becomes very impressive as to  quantity and quality when we find  Riccobaldo at grips with [[Julius Caesar]], at least the  problematic  ''[[De bello Alexandrino]]'', along with ''[[De bello Africo]]'' and  ''[[De bello Hispaniensi]]'' (''On the Alexandrine War'', ''On the African War'', ''On the Hispanic War'');  [[Cicero]]’s  ''[[Laelius de amicitia]]'' (''Laelius on Friendship''’) and  ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' (''Rhetoric: For Herennius''), and other works, too. We can add the  ''[[Distichs of Cato]]'' (''Catonis Disticha''), [[Einhard]], [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]], [[Horace]], certain texts to be found in the so-called  ''Spicilegium Ravennatis historiae'';  [[Virgil]], perhaps the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Vincent of Beauvais]], and the manuscripts of the [[Abbey of Santa Giustina]] in  [[Padua]], without excluding others still.

For this very considerable widening of his learning, Riccobaldo certainly owed a great deal to his mixing in the circles of the pre-humanists of [[Padua]], from whom he learned much, but to whom he probably also gave not a little. In any case, there is no overlooking Riccobaldo nowadays as a figure of first rank in the history of Italian culture, despite his having been  neglected even in relatively recent times by historians who were otherwise not without merit.

Other works by  Riccobaldo, apart from those listed below, are his  geographical  compilations, one of which, the  ''De locis orbis'', was published for the first time only in 1986, while the other,  ''De origine urbium Italie'', had in 2013 still not been published. There are two minor treatises witnessed to by the manuscripts  Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Ottob. Iat. 2072, cc. 45-58 e Parma, Biblioteca Palatina, Parm. 331, cc. 45-67 (for the first); and Venice, Biblioteca . Nazionale  Marciana, Lat. X, 169 (3847), cc. 2-31 (for the  second). While neither can be dated with any precision,  the first of these works if fully of his marure period, and the second from his last years.

'''Senâm''' is the name of a long, low [[hill]] situated in [[M'sila Province]], [[Algerian people|Algeria]], southwest of Algiers. The hill is covered with a large number of [[stone circle]]s.

These stone circles are built of natural [[limestone]], with standing slabs two to three feet high. The diameter of the circles varies between about 23 feet (± 7 meter) and 34 feet (± 10 meter). The entrance to the circles is on the southeastern side of the hill, through a larger, surrounding circle. It is uncertain if the niche was once roofed.  The center of the circle is filled with stones for unknown purposes, possibly as a [[grave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Rough stone monuments and their builders|last= Peet |first= T.

[[Image:Société Jersiaise door, Jersey.jpg|thumb|Door of 9 Pier Road, [[Saint Helier]], Jersey – house given to La Société Jersiaise for use as museum (now part of the Jersey Museum). [[Motto]] over door reads: ''Fier coum Cyrus, mes viers garçons, j'vos ouvre l'us, l'us d'ma caumine'' (Proud as [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], my old boys, I open to you the door, the door of my cottage)]]

The '''Société Jersiaise''' is a [[learned society]] in [[Jersey]] which was founded in 1873, in the manner of similar county societies in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[:fr:société savante|Sociétés Savantes]] in [[France]] for the purposes of:

*''"The Publication of Local History,
*''The encouragement of the use of French, the official language'',
*''The study of the ancient local dialect'',
*''To achieve, as far as possible, the conservation of all prehistoric and historical sites'',
*''To found a library, mainly historical and archaeological'',
*''To collaborate with other societies with similar aims''" &lt;ref name= statement&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=J|title=A Review of the Past Century|journal=Bulletin Annuel de la Société Jersiaise|year=1973|volume=Special Issue|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Société continues to fulfill these objectives, with two important differences – because it can no longer be said that French is the official language, the encouragement of its use has been dropped and, secondly, an important addition to the aims is the study of all branches of the [[natural history]] of the island and publication of the results of fieldwork in these subjects. By 1878 a museum had been formed.&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt; In 1893 the Société moved to No. 9 Pier Rd,&lt;ref name="statement"/&gt; which continues to house the museum. The Société is a registered charity funded through subscriptions, donations and legacies.

==History==
On 28 January 1873 a meeting of notables of the island took place to discuss the formation of a society for the preservation of the island's archaeological, historical and linguistic heritage, perceived to be threatened by the expansion of St Helier and coastal development. Those present were aware of the foundation of similar societies in mainland [[Normandy]], such as [[:fr:Société des Antiquaires de Normandie|Société des Antiquaires de Normandie]] (founded 1824) and similar county societies in the United Kingdom. In 1893 the Société was given a large townhouse in [[Saint Helier]] which became the base for its operations including its library and museum. In 1913 the various branches of activity were formalised into 'sections', amongst the first being Archaeology and History. The Section structure still exists and now comprise some 15 sections.

From its inception the Société engaged in archaeological work at numerous sites around the island; most importantly beginning work at [[La Cotte de St Brelade]] in 1905, a [[Neanderthal]] site of international importance. In 1919 the Société purchased the important Neolithic site of [[La Hougue Bie]], excavating it in 1924 revealing a Neolithic chambered passage grave c.4000BC. The site was then restored and opened as a museum. The Sociéte flourished throughout the 20th century, notwithstanding the difficult years of the German military [[occupation of the Channel Islands]] between 1940–1945. Despite the severe hardships and lack of resources suffered by the island, the museum at Pier Rd remained open throughout the Occupation, but despite protestations La Hougue Bie museum was requisitioned for military purposes by the Nazi occupiers.

Post-war the Société continued to grow and add to its collections to the extent that during the 1970s a new headquarters was built adjoining the Pier Road Museum. In 1987 the Société entered into an agreement with the [[States of Jersey]] for its museums to be run by the [[Jersey Heritage Trust]], whilst retaining ownership of its collections. This enabled the Société to concentrate on its core activities of research and publication. In 1990 the Société also entered into a working partnership with the [[National Trust for Jersey]] which its members had helped to found in 1937, to develop a country life museum at [[Hamptonne]], St Lawrence, a late medieval farm with manorial pretensions, the National Trust purchasing the property, the Société financing the restoration. Presently, the Société has approximately 2,000 members.

==Library==
The Société library contains much unique and important material about Jersey and comparative academic literature in the form of published works and manuscript documents including maps. The Société employs a professional librarian.

==Photographic archive==
The Société Jersiaise Photographic Archive contains, as a result of the foresight of early members, by far the most important collection of historic [[Photograph|photographic images]] of the island. A professional photographic archivist is employed by the Société to manage the collection of approximately 100,000 images dating from the mid-1840s to the present day.

==Museum collections==
Now curated by [[Jersey Heritage]] the Société's extensive museum collections contain items on all aspects of Jersey life, in particular Jersey's archaeological heritage but also. This remains the only substantial collection of Jersey material and is continually expanded by purchase and donation of new pieces, most recently (as of August 2012) a complete [[Neolithic]] [[jadeite]] [[Ring (jewellery)|ring]] (anneau-disque) which had been discovered in Jersey in the late 1980s but sold by the finder to a private collector in the [[United States|USA]].

==Publications==
Much of the work of the Société is published in its ''Bulletin Annuel'' commenced in 1875. In addition, the Société has published many works of its members and other scholars. In its early years the Société published many primary sources, such as the Cartulaire des Îles and Actes des États de Jersey to enable its members and others to carry out primary research. Latterly, it has published many secondary works produced by its members and other scholars, many of which remain in print.

The ''Bulletin'' has been digitised and is available to [http://societe-jersiaise.org/bulletins view on their website].

'''Solomon Zeitlin''', '''שְׁלֹמֹה צײטלין''', '''Шломо Цейтлин''' ''Shlomo Cejtlin'' (''Tseitlin, Tseytlin'') (28 May 1886 or 31 May 1892, in [[Chashniki]], [[Vitebsk Governorate]] (now in [[Vitebsk Region]]) in [[Russia]] &amp;ndash; 28 December 1976, in [[United States]]) was a Jewish historian, Talmudic scholar and in his time the world’s leading authority on the Second Commonwealth. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jta.org/1976/12/30/archive/solomon-zeitlin-dead-at-84&lt;/ref&gt;His work ''The Rise and Fall of the Judean State'' is about the [[Second Temple period]].

==Biography==
Born in Chasniki, Russia, he attended the Gymnasium and later the Academy of Baron Gunzberg. There he met and formed a lifelong friendship with [[Zalman Shazar]]. In 1904 while in Russia he obtained [[Semikhah]]. In Paris in 1916 he was awarded a Th.D. from the Ecole Rabbinique and an Eleve Titulaire de la Section des Sciences Religeuses from the University of Paris. In 1915 he emigrated to America.  He received his doctorate in 1917 and became professor of Rabbinics.&lt;ref&gt; Solomon Zeitlin (May 28, 1886-December 28, 1976) by David Weiss Halivni and Sidney B. Hoenig; Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research &lt;/ref&gt;  Zeitlin taught at [[Yeshiva College (Yeshiva University)|Yeshiva College]] in New York for two years before going to [[Dropsie College]] in Philadelphia where he served as a Fellow in Rabbinics. He edited the academic journal, the [[Jewish Quarterly Review]] (JQR)(1940-1976).  With A.A. Neuman he co-edited volumes 31–57, and continued as sole editor until his death in 1976. He controversially devoted considerable page-space of the JQR between 1949 and 1964 to engage in scholarly claim and counterclaim over the authenticity and pre-Christian origin of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. Publishing some two dozen articles on the subject he remained convinced of their late date.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-quarterly-review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://americanjewisharchives.org/publications/journal/PDF/2009_61_01_00_doc_Saperstein.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;   &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/402/000050252/ Solomon Zeitlin], in the [[NNDB]]&lt;/ref&gt;. In the JQR July 1961 edition he published an article ″Jewish Rights in Palestine″ by British philosopher historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] and his own response ″Jewish Rights in Eretz Israel (Palestine)″ where he rebukes Toynbee for lack of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Toynbee Rebuked by U.S. Scholar for Renewed Attack on Jews|http://www.jta.org/1961/12/01/archive/prof-toynbee-rebuked-by-u-s-scholar-for-renewed-attack-on-jews&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to history he taught [[Talmud]], wrote more than 400 articles and books and was instrumental in organizing the American Academy of Jewish Research. He never married and had no immediate survivors.

'''''Terry Jones' Barbarians''''' is a 4-part TV documentary series first broadcast on [[BBC 2]] in 2006. It was written and presented by [[Terry Jones]], and it challenges the received Roman and Roman Catholic notion of the [[barbarian]].

Professor [[Barry Cunliffe]] of the [[University of Oxford]] acted as consultant for the series.

==Episodes==
==="The Primitive Celts"===
First broadcast 26 May 2006, this episode challenges the popular view of Celtic society as a [[primitive culture]] that was uncivilised. Compared to [[Rome]], it was actually an advanced society and, in some ways, even more advanced than Rome. For example, many of the roads in [[Gaul]] that were assumed to have been built by the Romans were actually built by the Celts themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article714033.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=Decline and fall of the Roman myth | date=7 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gaul was rich and tempting to Rome. The Roman general, [[Julius Caesar]], set out to conquer Gaul with a professional army. The Celts stood no chance against Caesar and the Romans and so today Rome's version of history is remembered.

==="The Savage Goths"===

First broadcast 2 June 2006, it discusses [[Arminius]], [[Trajan's Dacian Wars]] and [[Alaric I]]'s sack of Rome.

==="The Brainy Barbarians"===
First broadcast 9 June 2006, it shows how Ancient Greeks and Persians were far from the Romans' view of them as effeminate and addicted to luxury. The Greeks valued science and mathematics, and the Persians had initially allowed [[multiculturalism]] among the different ethnic groups of its empire (until years of war with Rome).

==="The End of the World"===
First broadcast 16 June 2006, this episode discusses two barbarian babies born in 400 AD. One would grow up to become the most feared of all, [[Attila the Hun]]. The other, [[Geiseric]], led the [[Vandals]] whom history has cast as destroyers. It is claimed that [[Roman civilization]] ended not by the invasion of these tribes but by the loss of the African tax base. The common view of Rome and barbarians was a result of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] popularizing the Roman version of the truth.

'''Thomas Walsingham''' (died c. 1422) was an [[England|English]] chronicler, and is the source of much of the knowledge of the reigns of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] and [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], and the careers of [[John Wycliffe|John Wycliff]] and [[Wat Tyler]].

Walsingham was a Benedictine monk who spent most of his life at St. Albans Abbey, where he was superintendent of the copying room ([[scriptorium]]). His works include ''Chronicon Angliæ'', controversially attacking [[John of Gaunt]], and ''Ypodigma Neustriæ'' (Chronicle of Normandy), justifying Henry V's invasion, and dedicated to him in 1419.

He is no relation to Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], spymaster to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].

== Life ==
He became a [[monk]] at St Albans, where he appears to have passed the whole of his monastic life, excepting a period from 1394 to 1396 during which he was prior of [[Wymondham Abbey]], [[Norfolk, England]], another [[Benedictine]] house. At St Albans he was in charge of the ''scriptorium'', or writing room, and he died about 1422.

Walsingham is stated by Bale and Pits to have been a native of [[Norfolk]]. This is probably an inference from his name, as [[Walsingham]] is a village in that county. 
From an early period he was connected with the abbey of [[St Albans Abbey]] at [[St Albans]], [[Hertfordshire]], and was doubtless at school there. 
An inconclusive passage in his ''Historia Anglicana'' has been taken as evidence that he was educated at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. 
The abbey of St. Albans, however, maintained particularly close relations with Oxford, sending its novices to be trained at St. Alban Hall and its monks at [[Gloucester College]]. 
It is probable, therefore, that Walsingham was at the university.{{sfn|Leadam|1899}}

Subsequently, as the register book of benefactors of St. Albans Abbey preserved in [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], shows, he held in the abbey not only the office of precentor, implying some musical education, but the more important one of scriptorarius, or superintendent of the copying-room. According to the register it was under [[Thomas de la Mare]], who was abbot from 1350 to 1396, that he held these offices. 
Before 1388, he compiled a work (''Chronica Majora'') well known at that date as a book of reference. 
In 1394, he was of standing sufficient to be promoted to the dignity of prior of Wymondham.{{sfn|Leadam|1899}}

He ceased to be prior of Wymondham in 1396, and was recalled to St. Albans, where he composed his ''Ypodigma Neustriæ, or Demonstration of Events in Normandy,'' dedicated to [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], about 1419. His ''Historia Anglicana,'' indeed, is carried down to 1422, though it remains a matter of controversy whether the latter portion is from his pen. Nothing further is known of his life. Pits speaks of Walsingham's office of ‘scriptorarius’ at St. Albans Abbey as that of historiographer royal (regius historicus), and as bestowed on Walsingham by the abbot at the instance of the king. 
This king, according to Bale and Pits, was [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], for both of them assert that Walsingham flourished A.D. 1440. 
The title of historiographer royal has probably no more basis than Bale's similar story of [[William Rishanger]]. 
Bale makes his case worse by adding that Walsingham was the author of a work styled ''Acta Henrici Sexti.'' 
This is now unknown. 
If the ‘Chronica Majora’ was written, as must be supposed, at the latest not long after 1380, Walsingham must have been of exceptional age for that period in 1440. 
It is quite inconceivable that he can have been writing histories after 1461, the virtual close of Henry VI's reign. The ''Acta regis Henrici Sexti'' is therefore probably apocryphal, and Bale and Pits have post-dated Walsingham.{{sfn|Leadam|1899}}

==Works==
Recent research conjecturally assigns to Walsingham the following six chronicles: 
# ''Chronica Majora,'' now lost, written before 1388.
# The ''Chronicon Angliæ'' from 1328 to 1388, edited by Mr. (later Sir) [[E. M. Thompson]] in the Rolls Series in 1874. This was previously known to have been compiled by a monk of St. Albans, but had escaped attention by being erroneously catalogued as Walsingham's ‘Ypodigma Neustriæ.’ The ‘Chronicon’ ranges from 1328 to 1388. The actions and motives of John of Gaunt are bitterly assailed in the ‘Chronicon,’ and it is evident that on the accession of Henry IV the ‘scandalous chronicle,’ as its editor calls the ‘Chronicon,’ was suppressed by the monks of St. Albans, fearful of the consequences of publishing these attacks upon the king's father, and its place was taken by the ‘Chronicle of St. Albans,’ No. 4 infra. Very few manuscripts of it have therefore survived. Two shorter forms of this ‘Chronicon’ exist in a Bodleian manuscript (316) written soon after 1388, and in the Cottonian MS. Faustina B. ix. In these a passage occurs referring the reader for further particulars of Wat Tyler's rebellion to the (lost) ‘Chronica Majora’ of Thomas Walsingham at St. Albans.
# Between 1390 and 1394, when he left St. Albans, Walsingham compiled the ''Gesta Abbatum,'' a history of the abbots of St. Albans from its foundation by Offa.&lt;br&gt;As in his other works, Walsingham took the early part of the history from the writings of previous chroniclers, particularly of Matthew Paris, the great St. Albans chronicler. The portion beginning with 1308 is his original composition.&lt;br&gt;It is only brought down to 1390, probably because of Walsingham's promotion to Wymundham, though he intimates his intention of bringing it down to the death of Abbot Thomas de la Mare in 1396. This was done by a continuator. The ''Gesta Abbatum'' was edited for the Rolls Series in 1867–9 in 2 vols.
# A chronicle extant in [[British Museum]] Royal MS. 13 E ix. ff. 177–326, which has no title, but from the fact that it was written and preserved at St. Albans is commonly called ''The St. Albans MS.'' or ''Chronicle.'' It was compiled in or soon after 1394, its last date being 1393. It covers the period 1272 to 1393, incorporating successively the chronicles of Matthew of Westminster, Adam Murimuth, the continuation of Trivet's ‘Annales,’ John Trokelowe, and others. Its text agrees with the ‘Chronicon Angliæ’ (No. 2 supra) to 1369.&lt;br&gt;From this point it varies frequently from the ''Chronicon,'' and at almost all points it tones down the ''Chronicon's'' unfavourable comments on the action and character of John of Gaunt. The ‘Historia Vitæ et Regni Ricardi Secundi’ published by Hearne in 1729 was largely borrowed from this ‘St. Albans MS.’
# ''Historia Anglicana,'' also designated by early writers ''Historia Brevis,'' which comprises the years 1272 to 1422. After a critical examination of the ‘Historia Anglicana,’ Mr. Riley comes to the conclusion that only of the portion extending from 1377 to 1392 is Walsingham the author. The grounds for this conclusion are, in short, (1) that the last period into which the work may be divided (1393–1422) contains a far larger number of petty inaccuracies than the fifteen years 1377–92; (2) that for some time after 1392 the history is ‘less full and satisfactory;’ and (3) differences of style. With this conclusion Sir E. M. Thompson agrees.&lt;br&gt; On the other hand, Mr. Gairdner suggests that an explanation of the defects of the later portion may be found in the circumstance that in 1394–1400 Walsingham was absent from St. Albans as prior of Wymundham. The ''Ypodigma Neustriæ,'' which is admitted on all hands to be by Walsingham, also contains a considerable number of inaccuracies, and these may possibly have crept both into this work and the latter part of the ''Historia Anglicana'' owing to the approach of old age. Lastly, as far as 1419 the ''Historia Anglicana'' is frequently word for word the same as the ''Ypodigma Neustriæ.'' Walsingham's ‘Historia Anglicana’ was first printed as ‘Historia brevis Angliæ ab Eduardo I ad Henricum V’ (London, 1594, fol.); another edition, by W. Camden, Frankfort, 1603, 4to. It was edited by Mr. Riley for the Rolls Series in 1863 (2 vols.).&lt;br&gt; A chronicle which is chiefly an abridgment of the ''Historia Anglicana,'' and is also attributed to Walsingham, exists in the Bodleian Library (Rawl. MS. B. 152), and at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] (E. 5, 8). It begins in 1342 and ends at 1417, and contains a note referring to the ''Polychronicon,'' the name by which the ''Historia Anglicana'' is sometimes known. This abridgment of the ‘Historia Anglicana’ is doubtless the work by Walsingham which Bale entitles the ‘Auctuarium Polychronici’ (1342 to 1417).
# The ''Ypodigma Neustriæ,'' like the ''Historia Anglicana,'' is a compilation. Its object was to provide Henry V with an instructive summary of the history of his predecessors, the dukes of Normandy, and to furnish an historical justification of his invasion of France. Its dedication was written after the conquest of Normandy, completed by the surrender of Rouen in January 1419. But the portion allotted to Normandy (‘Neustria’) in the volume is comparatively small. From the time of Duke Rollo to the Norman conquest of England Walsingham borrows from the ‘Historia Normannorum’ of William of Jumièges. His other authorities are [[Ralph de Diceto]], [[William of Malmesbury]], [[John Brompton]], [[Henry Knighton]], [[Nicholas Trivet]], [[Roger de Hoveden]], [[Matthew Paris]], [[William Rishanger]], [[Matthew Westminster]], [[Adam Murimuth]], the St. Albans chronicle, the chronicle of [[Walter de Hemingburgh]], the Harleian MS. 3634, and the manuscripts in [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]]. The ''Ypodigma'' was first published in London in 1574 fol., and was edited by Mr. H. T. Riley in the Rolls Series in 1876.{{sfn|Leadam|1899}}

==Assessment==
Pits remarks in his life of Walsingham that we owe to him the knowledge of many historical incidents not recorded by other writers. He is the principal authority for the reigns of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] and [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].
Our acquaintance with [[John Wycliff]]'s career is largely due to his information, though he was greatly prejudiced against [[lollardy]]. 
He is also the chief authority for the insurrection of [[Wat Tyler]] in 1381. 
The [[Peasants Revolt]] of that year was formidable at St. Albans, the abbey being besieged, many of its court rolls and other muniments burnt, and charters of manumission extorted. Walsingham's admiration for Henry V, as the opposer of [[lollardy]], led him to follow with minute detail the progress of that king's campaigns in France.{{sfn|Leadam|1899}}
 
Walsingham was a painstaking collector of facts rather than an historian, though he sometimes manipulated his facts with ulterior objects, as is illustrated by the contradictory accounts he gave of the characters of Richard II and [[John of Gaunt]]. Tanner mentions a manuscript in the library of [[St. John's College, Oxford]], as attributed to Thomas Walsingham. 
It is intituled ''De Generatione et Natura Deorum,'' a title which suggests remoteness from Thomas Walsingham's literary pursuits.{{sfn|Leadam|1899}}

Walsingham was no relation to [[Francis Walsingham|Sir Francis Walsingham]], spymaster to Queen Elizabeth I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10084">'''Velasco''' was a town in [[Texas]], [[United States]], that was later [[annexed]] by the city of [[Freeport, Texas|Freeport]].&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hef03 |title=Freeport, Texas |author=Kleiner, Diana J. |work=[[Handbook of Texas|Handbook of Texas Online]] |publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]] |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded in 1831, Velasco is situated on the east side of the [[Brazos River]] in southeast Texas. It is sixteen miles south of [[Angleton, Texas]], and four miles from the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

The town's early history is closely tied with the [[Battle of Velasco]] and the [[Texas Revolution]]. Velasco was an important entry point for American settlers in Texas. In 1836 following the decisive [[Battle of San Jacinto]], Velasco was named a temporary capital of the [[Republic of Texas]] by the interim President [[David G. Burnet]].&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hvv07 |title=Velasco, Texas |author=Weir, Merle |work=[[Handbook of Texas|Handbook of Texas Online]] |publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]] |accessdate=2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1837, the final actions of the [[Battle of Brazos River]] occurred there.

==History==
Velasco was originally located on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] on the east side of the mouth of the [[Brazos River]] where present-day [[Surfside Beach, Texas|Surfside]] is located.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; In 1821, the schooner ''Lively'' landed at the site with thirty-eight men, the first of [[Stephen F. Austin]]'s colonists. At the time, Texas was part of Mexico, but Austin had obtained permission to bring American settlers into the area, with the first colonists settling in what is now southern [[Brazoria County, Texas|Brazoria County]].&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt;

Velasco consisted of a single house until 1831, when Mexico set up a customs port there and dispatched troops to help the customs collector.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; More than 25,000 settlers entered through the port.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt;  The town was named for a Mexican general, as was [[Quintana, Texas|Quintana]], on the opposite side of the river.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt;

Velasco was the site of the [[Battle of Velasco]] in 1832.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; The battle was fought on June 26, 1832 between Texas colonists and Mexico four years before the [[Texas Revolution]]. The Mexican commander during the conflict, [[Domingo de Ugartechea]], tried to stop the Texans from transporting a cannon up the Brazos River to attack the city of [[Anahuac, Texas|Anahuac]]. The Texans were led by [[Brazoria Alcade]], [[John Austin (soldier)|John Austin]], and the schoolteacher and farmer [[Henry Smith (Texas governor)|Henry Smith]]. The Texan militia eventually prevailed over the greatly outnumbered Mexicans. Ugartechea surrendered after a three-day battle, once he realized he would not be receiving reinforcements. His soldiers had also run out of ammunition.

In 1834, a [[cholera]] epidemic reduced the population to 100.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; After the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], President David G. Burnet made the town the temporary capital of the Republic of Texas.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; Government records were housed at [[Fort Velasco]] until the first capital of Texas was established at [[Columbia, Texas|Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] signed the [[Treaties of Velasco]] on May 14, 1836 acknowledging Texas independence.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt;

===Antebellum period===
Between the Texas Revolution and the [[American Civil War]], Velasco and Quintana served as summer resorts for wealthy [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] families of the region.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; The Galveston businessmen [[Samuel May Williams]] and [[Thomas F. McKinney]] established warehouses and organized shipping at the port. By 1838, a seminary for young ladies, Velasco Female Academy, and a school for young men, taught by [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] graduates, were established. Comfortable hotels were built to accommodate visitors and patrons of the racetrack, which was located a short distance upriver. A local post office operated from 1846 until 1891, when mail was rerouted through Quintana. Antebellum Velasco had business houses, homes, a hotel, boardinghouses, wharves, and a customhouse.  [[Steamboats]] embarked from the wharves for [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] and [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; With completion in 1856 of the first [[Intracoastal Waterway|intracoastal canal]] to Galveston Bay, however, the town began to decline, as much of its shipping was diverted to Galveston.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt;

===U.S. Civil War===
{{Main|American Civil War}}
During the U.S. Civil War, the port of Velasco was fortified by Confederate troops and eight gun batteries, and Union ships were forced to go to New Orleans for drinking water, food, and fuel.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; The port played an active role in the exchange of cotton for European guns, ammunition, milled goods, and medicines for army and home use. Federal vessels attempted to stop vital trade and fired upon shore defenses, patrols, and small craft seeking to outrun them.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt;

===Postbellum decline===
With the ruin of the plantation system after the war, Velasco and Quintana declined as resorts. In 1875 a hurricane destroyed the old town records. By 1884, Old Velasco's residents numbered only fifty.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt;

===New Velasco===
The new town of Velasco was surveyed and laid out four miles upriver in 1891, when a new Velasco post office was established.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; The port was officially opened by the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] [[William Windom]] on July 7, 1891.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt;  Over $1,000,000 worth of lots were sold to Midwesterners looking for greener pastures and a seaside environment. By 1892, New Velasco had 136 business establishments and 167 residences, an electric light plant, and a [[planing mill]]. Jetties were built by the Brazos River Channel and Dock Company by 1897, and the newly dug deepwater port ran to a depth of 17½ feet.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt;

Much of Velasco, first owned by [[John Austin Wharton (1806–1838)|John A.]] and [[William H. Wharton]], was later sold to an agent of the English [[Rothschild family]]. They planned to establish a great seaport at the site.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; By 1896 the community had a new lighthouse, several churches, schools, hotels, a national bank, a cottonseed oil mill, cotton gins, special and general stores, and two weekly newspapers.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; Old Velasco and Crescent Beach could be reached by electric railroad.

===Galveston Hurricane and aftermath===
The population had reached 3,000 when the [[1900 Galveston hurricane|Galveston hurricane of 1900]] wrecked the town.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; Velasco rebuilt slowly, enduring fluctuations of poverty and prosperity.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; By 1914, with a population of 1,000 and only one newspaper remaining, the community had a fish and oyster plant and shipped cattle, cotton, cane sugar, and syrup.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; The population dropped to a low of 400 in the mid-1930s during the [[Great Depression]], when the town supported only 12 businesses.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt;

===Brazos River diversion and World War II===
The port of Freeport had been built on the Brazos River four miles upstream.  The river below the port required frequent dredging in order to accommodate larger ships.  In 1929, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] diverted the course of Brazos River three miles west, leaving the four-mile segment of the Old Brazos as a stand-alone ship channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gulf.rice.edu/modBdel.html |title=Modern Brazos Delta |publisher=[[Rice University|Rice University Gulf of Mexico Research Group]] |accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diversion of the Brazos River and the formation of a tidal [[estuary]] deep enough to accommodate large vessels in the old river channel subsequently revived both Velasco and nearby [[Freeport, Texas|Freeport]].&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt; Construction of chemical-industry facilities during [[World War II]] increased available jobs, and the population grew from 900 in 1940, when the city was incorporated with [[E. F. Roeller]] as mayor, to 5,200 by 1950.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas" /&gt;

With a population estimated at 4,000 in 1956, Velasco was annexed by Freeport on July 27, 1957.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Texas2" /&gt; The community subsequently became part of the Brazosport industrial and port area and [[Brazosport Independent School District]].

==Government and infrastructure==
The [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] [[Clemens Unit]] is located in an [[unincorporated area]] in [[Brazoria County]], near Velasco.&lt;ref name="Accountfarm"&gt;"[http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/prisons/convictlease/page3.html Convict Leasing and State Account Farming (1883-1909)]."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7980">'''Yichus''' (יִחוּס), a [[Hebrew]]-based [[Yiddish]] word for [[family tree]] or [[genealogy]], to those who take it seriously, is the [[gatekeeper]] to considering potential marriage partners.

Colloquially it refers to the chain of origin for a statement, creative work or object.&lt;ref&gt;Talk:Midrash (timestamped 17:19, 15 May 2007), QUOTE: If the original source has "yichus" (i.e., Jewish Encyclopedia or Brittanica) ...&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The biblical spelling used in Nech. 7:5 סֵפֶר הַיַּחַשׂ (Book of Lineage)&lt;ref&gt;capitalized ''here'' by Artscroll, but not for the directive
לְהִתְיַחֵשׂ, "trace your lineage"&lt;/ref&gt; differs in the last letter, compared to both Yiddish and modern Hebrew (יִחוּס, sometimes ייחוס).

Although the word '''yichus''' originated in Hebrew&lt;ref name=Tweb&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.torchweb.org/torah_detail.php?id=158
|title=Parshas Bamidbar (5771) - Got Yichus?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nechemia,7:5&lt;/ref&gt;, the term is generally accepted as a Yiddish word that has flowed into Modern English.

The Anglicized word has been transliterated as
* Yichus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper  |newspaper=The New York Times

|title=Yivo Encyclopedia - Yikhes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ironically, it was in the Obituary of a [[YIVO]] expert who spelled it ''Yikhes'' that the NY Times spelled it ''Yichus''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Yiches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.jewish-languages.org/jewish-english-lexicon/words/618

==In Judaism==
Despite the fact that being Jewish from birth is universally accepted based on the religion of the mother&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.wordnik.com/words/yichus
|title=Yichus - definition and meaning - Wordnik}}&lt;/ref&gt;,
that same universally accepted definition says "(the tribal affiliation, tradition, customs and nusach of prayer) are determined by 
the Jewish father." To the obvious question&lt;ref&gt;what if the father isn't Jewish&lt;/ref&gt; there is the question of why "Rabbah bar Bar Chanah"&lt;ref&gt;A sage in the Talmud. "Bar" means son of. "bar Bar" means son of son of. Chanah is a feminine name.&lt;/ref&gt; and the matter of the Blasphemer, Lev. 24:10-23, not accredited to the tribe of Dan.

As far back as the [[Talmud|Talmudic]] era, being son-in-law to someone widely respected was valued.&lt;ref&gt;Gittin,31b,re being son-in-law of the Reish GaLuSa, the Exilarch.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, even the ''Yichus'' of being son-in-law to the son-in-law and similar lineage links were on one side, versus "meritocratic leadership based on scholarship" on the other, in the areas of "the arrangement of marriages and determination of hierarchical social distinctions."&lt;ref name=YIVOencyc/&gt; 

There were those who, for the above&lt;ref&gt;meritocracy&lt;/ref&gt; and other reasons, devalued or hid it:

To help a child trace lineage, some families would write a "Yichus book"&lt;ref name=Margolis&gt;{{cite book

The focus of a Yichus brief (letter of relationship)&lt;ref name=Skirb&gt;{{cite web

Some families also kept a separate "Register of Circumcisions"&lt;ref name=Margolis/&gt;.

==Family name==
For various reasons, Last names&lt;ref&gt;written in some cultures "last" hence the terminology&lt;/ref&gt;/family names were changed, and sometimes reverted&lt;ref name=Margolis/&gt;. Hence certain family names, such as Cohen, are not as strongly indicative of being a [[Kohen]] as [[Katz (surname)|Katz]].
