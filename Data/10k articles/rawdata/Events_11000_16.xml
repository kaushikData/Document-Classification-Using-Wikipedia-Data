[[File:Red obby oss maiden 20050502.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Old 'Oss capturing a passing maiden during the Mayday festival.]]

The ''''Obby 'Oss festival''' is a [[folk culture|folk custom]] that takes place each [[May Day]] in [[Padstow]], a coastal town in the southwest English county of [[Cornwall]]. It involves two separate processions making their way around the town, each containing an eponymous [[hobby horse]] known as the 'Obby 'Oss.

The festival starts at midnight on [[May Day|May Eve]] when townspeople gather outside the Golden Lion Inn to sing the "Night Song." By morning, the town has been dressed with greenery and flowers placed around the [[maypole]]. The excitement begins with the appearance of one of the 'Obby 'Osses. Male dancers cavort through the town dressed as one of two 'Obby 'Osses, the "Old" and the "Blue Ribbon" 'Obby 'Osses; as the name suggests, they are stylised kinds of horses. Prodded on by [[acolyte]]s known as "Teasers," each wears a mask and black frame-hung cape under which they try to catch young maidens as they pass through the town. Throughout the day, the two parades, led by the "MC" in his top hat and decorated stick, followed by a band of accordions and drums, then the 'Oss and the Teaser, with a host of people, the "Mayers" - all singing the "Morning Song."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lyricsty.com/rankin-family-padstow-the-may-morning-song-lyrics.html|title=Family Rankin — Padstow (The May Morning Song) lyrics|last=|first=|date=|website=Lyricsty.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084829/http://www.lyricsty.com/rankin-family-padstow-the-may-morning-song-lyrics.html#|archive-date=19 August 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-12-30|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; – pass along the streets of the town. Finally, late in the evening, the two 'osses meet, at the maypole, before returning to their respective stables where the crowd sings of the 'Obby 'Oss death, until its resurrection the following May Eve.

During the twentieth century the existence of the festival was described by a number of [[folkloristics|folklorists]] who brought greater attention to it. This helped to turn the event as a popular tourist attraction and establish it as one of the most famous folk customs in Britain.

== Description ==

[[File:Red obby oss party 20050502.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Old 'Oss party attending the 'Obby 'Oss with dozens of accordions and drums.]]

The festival takes place on [[May Day]] every year.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=81}} It entails two separate processions that make their way around Padstow on circuits that take twelve hours to traverse.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=81}} Each procession represents a different half of the town's community.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=81}}
Only those whose families have lived in Padstow for at least two generations are permitted to take part in the processions.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=81}}
Each procession contains by an 'Obby 'Oss, a [[hobby horse]] consisting of an oval frame covered in black oilskin, which has a small horse's head in the front with a snapping jaw.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=81}} This is led by an individual known as the Teaser, who is dressed in white and carries a painted club.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=81}} The procession also contains a retinue of white-clad individuals, some playing accordions and drums.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=81}}

This retinue sings a local version of a Mayers' song.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=81}} At times this tune becomes a [[dirge]], at which the 'Obby 'Oss sinks to the ground and lies flat. When the chorus becomes triumphant again the 'Oss rises and continues along the procession.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=81}}

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The origins of the celebrations in Padstow are unknown. There is extensive documentary evidence of British community May Day celebrations in the 16th century and earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the earliest mention of the ''Obby 'Oss'' at Padstow dates from 1803. An earlier hobby horse is mentioned in the Cornish language drama ''[[Beunans Meriasek]]'', a life of the Camborne saint, where it is associated with a troupe, or "companions."{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
There is no evidence to suggest that the 'Obby 'Oss festival is older than the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=82}}

It has been speculated that such festivals have pre-Christian origins, such as in the [[Celt]]ic festival of [[Beltane]] in the [[Celtic nations]], and the [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] celebrations during the [[Germanic calendar|Þrimilci-mōnaþ]] (literally ''Three-Milking Month'' or ''Month of Three Milkings'')&lt;ref name=CAPUTXV&gt;''Caput XV:
De mensibus Anglorum'' from ''De mensibus Anglorum''.

The custom attracted little attention outside of the town until 1907, when the folklorist [[Francis Etherington]] drew attention to it.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=82}} In 1913 the folklorist [[Thurstan Peter]] wrote about it; influenced by the ideas of the anthropologist [[James Frazer]], Peter argued that the 'Obby 'Oss custom might have once been a pre-Christian religious ritual designed to secure fertility.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=82}} The idea that the custom had pre-Christian roots helped to convert it into a tourist attraction.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=82}} This idea of the custom as an pre-Christian one percolated into the Padstow community, for when the historian [[Ronald Hutton]] visited the town in 1985 he found locals describing it to him as an ancient pagan fertility rite.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=81}}

=== Modern developments ===

[[File:May Day in Padstow - geograph.org.uk - 738587.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Crowds of tourists observing the Padstow 'Obby 'Oss custom in 2006]]

By the 1990s, the 'Obby 'Oss festival was a major attraction that drew large numbers of visitors to Padstow.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=81}} By that point, Hutton referred to it as "one of the most famous and most dramatic folk customs of modern Britain",{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=81}} adding that it constituted "a tremendous reaffirmation of communal pride and solidarity in this small and normally quiet settlement".{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=81}}

== Celebration practice ==
The celebration itself starts at midnight on 1 May with unaccompanied singing around the town starting at the Golden Lion Inn. By the morning, the town is dressed with greenery, flowers and flags, with the focus being the [[maypole]].
The climax arrives when two groups of dancers progress through the town, one of each team wearing a stylised recreation of a 'horse.' The two 'osses are known as the "Old" and the "Blue Ribbon" 'osses. During the day a number of "Junior" or "colt" 'osses appear, operated by children. Accompanied by drums and accordions and led by acolytes known as "Teasers", each 'oss is adorned by a gruesome mask and black frame-hung cape under which they try to catch young maidens as they pass through the town. The Blue ribbon 'oss is apparently of more recent origin. In the late 19th century it was supported by members of the [[Temperance movement]] who were trying to discourage the consumption of alcohol associated with the "old" 'oss followers. After the first world war the imperative of temperance was lost, and the 'oss became known as the ''Peace 'Oss''. Each 'oss has a "stable" (in the case of the ''Old 'Oss'', the Golden Lion Inn and the ''Blue Ribbon 'Oss'', the Institute, from which they emerge at the start of the day's proceedings and retire at the end. Sometimes in the late afternoon, the 'osses may meet at the maypole and dance together.

'Obby 'Oss traditions also exist in nearby [[Barnstaple]] and [[Combe Martin]].

[[Minehead]] in Somerset also has two large hobby horses, the Sailors' Horse and the Town Horse. Although more pointed or boat-shaped than the Padstow 'Osses, they are similar in that the dancer within the costume wears a tall, conical hat with a grotesque mask over their face; the horse framework is suspended from the dancer's shoulders and a long skirt hangs down to partly hide their body; the animal's heads are small and wooden with snapping jaws. They also capture bystanders.

There is documentary evidence of an 'Oss at Penzance in the late 19th century, made with a caped stick and skull which has formed the basis of the Penglaz 'Obby 'Oss which appears during the [[Golowan festival]] and the [[Montol Festival]]; the 'oss is strikingly similar to the [[Mari Lwyd]] in Wales associated with the pre Christian deity [[Rhiannon]], known as [[Epona]] the horse goddess in continental Celtic cultures, passing into festive folklore as 'the Old Grey Mare' in neighbouring parts of Britain e.g. Dartmoor ([[Widecombe Fair (song)]]), Dorset ([[The Grey Mare and her Colts]]).

Similar [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] (May–June) folk tradition exists in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] where [[St George]] fights a dragon in the manner of the Cornish [[Mummers Play]]s. Tinsel cloaked street entertainers dress as the Welsh Mari Llywd but the snapping animal skull might be a goat or fox rather than horse and depicts  the [[Coco (folklore)|Coco]] or the [[Peluda]].

[[File:Old postcard of Saint Martha celebration in Tarascon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Tarasque from Southern France]]
The [[Tarasque]] procession from southern France has direct pre-Roman [[Celts|Celtic]] antecedents and a terrifying ancient [[Celtic sculpture]] at the Musée lapidaire d'[[Avignon]] depicts the monster hoarding severed human heads [[:fr:Tarasque|(wikipedia French with images)]].

There are some similarities between this festival and the [[Lajkonik]] hobby-horse festival in [[Kraków]], Poland. In particular the idea that young women may be captured or struck with a stick to bring them "luck" or fertility suggests a pagan, or at least medieval origin. Lajkonik is 700 years old.

Rather more recent is the [[Banbury]] Hobby-Horse festival, which started in 2000, and features ritual animals from all parts of the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hobbyhorsefestival.co.uk/|title=Banbury Hobby Horse Festival|last=|first=|date=|website=Hobby Horse Festival|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310073513/http://www.hobbyhorsefestival.co.uk/|archive-date=10 March 2016|dead-url=yes|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==
The jet failed to gain sufficient altitude upon takeoff, with eyewitnesses suggesting the nose was [[Rotation (aviation)|over-rotated]]. The F-86 Sabre has a dangerous and often fatal handling characteristic upon takeoff if the nose is raised prematurely from the runway. This handling characteristic of the F-86 was acknowledged from the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoover |first1=R.A.

The aircraft over-ran the runway, struck an earthen berm, and ripped through a chain link fence.  Two external underwing fuel tanks ruptured and ignited upon impact with the fence, creating a massive fireball.  The plane continued across Freeport Boulevard, crashing into a moving car, and struck at {{convert|150|mph}} a local Farrell's Ice Cream Parlor at approximately 4:25 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.sacbee.com/2002/04/01/4556786/after-30-years-a-farrells-healing.html | work = [[Sacramento Bee]] | title = After 30 years, a Farrell's healing| first = Tony | last = Bizjak | date = April 1, 2002 | accessdate = January 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The parlor was occupied in part by the Sacramento 49ers "Little League" football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.sacbee.com/1999/12/31/4556808/farrells-disaster-claimed-22-lives.html | title = Farrell's disaster claimed 22 lives | first = Stephen | last = Magagnini | date = December 31, 1999 | accessdate = January 12, 2014 | work =  [[Sacramento Bee]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-two people died, including twelve children. An eight-year-old survivor of the accident lost nine family members: both parents, two brothers, a sister, two grandparents and two cousins. A family of four also died in the accident. Two people were killed in the car struck on Freeport Boulevard. Immediately after the crash an elderly couple trying to cross the street to the crash site were struck by a vehicle, killing the wife.&lt;ref name=crash-at-farrels&gt;{{cite web| title=The Crash at Farrell's Ice Cream Parlor in Sacramento, CA – September 24, 1972| work=Check Six| year=2002 | url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Sabrejet_crash_site.htm| accessdate= January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crash could have claimed many more lives if the external fuel tanks had not ruptured prior to impact, or if the jet had not been slowed by hitting the moving car and other vehicles parked in front of the restaurant. The pilot suffered a broken leg and broken arm.&lt;ref name=bee/&gt;

==Aircraft==
The [[Canadair Sabre]] was a single-engine jet fighter built for the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1959. The Sabre was withdrawn from service in 1961 and placed in long-term storage. It was sold as surplus in the United States in 1971 and was bought by Spectrum Air, Inc., of Novato, California in the same year.&lt;ref name="ntsb" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] concluded that the accident was a result of pilot error due to lack of experience on the jet.  Bingham had logged less than four hours flying time in the Sabre.  The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) modified the rules governing the flight of ex-military jets over densely populated areas, and mandated clearance for such flights.&lt;ref name=40-years/&gt; Pilot requirements were also tightened: they would require a checkout by the manufacturer or military, and take-offs and landings would have to be observed by an FAA inspector to confirm proficiency.&lt;ref name=40-years&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.flightjournal.com/blog/2012/09/24/farrells-crash-remembered-40-years-later/ | work = Flight Journal| title = Farrell’s Crash Remembered 40 Years Later | first = Mike | last = Harbour | date = September 24, 2012 | accessdate = January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Firefighters Burn Institute]] was instituted a year after the crash, funded from donations given to local firefighters.&lt;ref name=bee/&gt;

==Memorial==
In 2002, a memorial was built at the site of the accident and dedicated in March 2003.  It consists of: a rose garden with two benches, a fountain, a concrete marker and two metal plaques with the names of those who died.&lt;ref name=bee/&gt;

In 2012, a service to commemorate the 40th anniversary was held to remember the victims of the accident.&lt;ref name=bee&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2012/09/24/4847905/somber-event-recalls-farrells.html |work=[[Sacramento Bee]] |title=Somber event recalls Farrell's jet-crash disaster |first=Alan |last=Pierleoni |accessdate=January 12, 2014 |date=September 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112211942/http://www.sacbee.com/2012/09/24/4847905/somber-event-recalls-farrells.html |archivedate=January 12, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last shooting was completed at PMA Kakul on 4 December 1997. The drama was produced by PTV Lahore centre and [[Shoman Productions]].

The events in the drama involve romance and comedy, while reflecting the [[Pakistan Army|Pakistan Army's]] operational involvement in the [[Bosnian War]] and [[Siachen conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepakistani.tv/i/12/pakistani-tv-dramas/alpha-bravo-charlie.htm |title=Alpha Bravo Charlie – Pakistani Television Dramas and TV Shows |publisher=Thepakistani.tv |date=2008-03-19 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pakistanica.com/tv/alpha-bravo-charlie/ |title=Alpha Bravo Charlie — Pakistani TV Drama |publisher=Pakistanica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story ==

As the name indicates, the drama is based on the life and times of three characters — Faraz, Kashif, and Gulsher also known as Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie respectively — and their friendship. These passionate young men wish to start their careers in the Pakistan army. In the initial episodes, ample footage is used to detail the background of every individual and the circumstances under which they enroll for the armed forces. Faraz is Mr Perfect, the guy who does everything right while Gulsher is a polite, simple-minded, shy person. Kashif is originally the funny man responsible for providing most of the comic relief through his antics, pranks and mischief. Eventually the series morphs into a coming-of-age story where the lead characters realize that there is more to life than their present happy-go-lucky lifestyle as they experience reality in all its fragility and extremities — jealousy, heartbreaks, trauma and death. Another important character is Shahnaaz, a confident, educated and well-mannered young lady, who plays an important role in the lives of these friends. Her involvement with them in the role of friend, wife and confidante adds reality to the series that is poignant and touching on a personal level. The main theme of the drama is that every person should lead a purposeful existence and that, if one has the will and the passion, he/she can achieve anything.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

'''Archaeanax''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Αρχαιάναξ) seems to have been a ruler of the [[Bosporan Kingdom]] some 40 years prior to the ascent of the Thracian [[Spartocids]].

==Biography==

[[File:Michael Foskett &amp; Nika Vlasenko 2.JPG|thumb|WDC World Youth (Under 21) Champions 2013, Michael Foskett &amp; Nika Vlasenko]]
'''Ballroom dance''' is a set of [[partner dance]]s, which are enjoyed both [[social dance|socially]] and [[ballroom dance#Competitive dancing|competitively]] around the world. Because of its [[performance dance|performance]] and [[entertainment]] aspects, ballroom dance is also widely enjoyed on stage, film, and television.

''Ballroom dance'' may refer, at its widest definition, to almost any type of partner dancing as recreation. However, with the emergence of [[dancesport]] in modern times, the term has become narrower in scope and traditionally refers to the five International Standard and five International Latin style dances (see dance [[Ballroom dance#Dances|categories]] below). The two styles, while differing in technique, rhythm and costumes, exemplify core elements of ballroom dancing such as control and cohesiveness. Developed in England,&lt;ref name=Franks&gt;Franks A.H. 1963. ''Social dance: a short history''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London.&lt;/ref&gt; the two styles are now regulated by the [[World Dance Council]] (WDC) and the [[World DanceSport Federation]] (WDSF). In the United States, two additional variations are popular: ''[[American Smooth]]'' and ''[[American Rhythm]]'', which combine elements of the Standard and Latin styles with influences from other dance traditions.

There are also a number of historical dances, and local or national dances, which may be danced in ballrooms or salons. Sequence dancing, in pairs or other formations, is still a popular style of ballroom dance.&lt;ref&gt;Silvester, Victor 1980. ''Old Time and sequence dancing''. Barrie and Jenkins, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions and history ==
[[File:Galliard.jpg|right|thumb|130px|Galliard in [[Siena]], Italy, 15th century]]
The term 'ballroom dancing' is derived from the word ''ball'' which in turn originates from the Latin word ''ballare'' which means 'to dance' (a ball-room being a large room specially designed for such dances). In times past, ballroom dancing was [[Social dance|social dancing]] for the privileged, leaving [[folk dancing]] for the lower classes. These boundaries have since become blurred. The definition of ballroom dance also depends on the era: balls have featured popular dances of the day such as the [[Minuet]], [[Quadrille]], [[Polonaise]], [[Polka]], [[Mazurka]], and others, which are now considered to be [[historical dance]]s.

=== Early modern period ===
The first authoritative knowledge of the earliest ballroom dances was recorded toward the end of the 16th century, when Jehan Tabourot, under the pen name "[[Thoinot Arbeau|Thoinot-Arbeau]]", published in 1588 his ''Orchésographie'', a study of late 16th-century French renaissance social dance. Among the dances described were the solemn [[basse danse]], the livelier [[branle]], [[pavane]], and the [[galliarde]] which [[Shakespeare]] called the "cinq pace" as it was made of five steps.&lt;ref name=silvester/&gt;

In 1650 the [[Minuet]], originally a peasant dance of [[Poitou]], was introduced into Paris and set to music by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and danced by the King [[Louis XIV]] in public. The Minuet dominated the ballroom from that time until the close of the 18th century.

Toward the latter half of the 16th century, Louis XIV founded his '[[Académie Royale de Musique|Académie Royale de Musique et de Danse]]', where specific rules for the execution of every dance and the "[[Positions of the feet in ballet|five positions]]" of the feet were formulated for the first time by members of the Académie. Eventually, the first definite cleavage between ballet and ballroom came when professional dancers appeared in the ballets, and the ballets left the Court and went to the stage. Ballet technique such as the [[Turnout (ballet)|turned out]] positions of the feet, however, lingered for over two centuries and past the end of the Victoria era.&lt;ref name=silvester /&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:Vernon and Irene Castle2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Vernon and Irene Castle]], early ballroom dance pioneers, c. 1910–18]]
The waltz with its modern hold took root in England in about 1812; in 1819 [[Carl Maria von Weber]] wrote ''[[Invitation to the Dance (Weber)|Invitation to the Dance]]'', which marked the adoption of the waltz form into the sphere of absolute music. The dance was initially met with tremendous opposition due to the semblance of impropriety associated with the closed hold, though the stance gradually softened.&lt;ref name=silvester&gt;Silvester, Victor 1993. ''Modern Ballroom Dancing''; rev. ed. London: Stanley Paul. (1st edition: London: H. Jenkins, 1927)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1840s several new dances made their appearance in the ballroom, including the [[polka]], [[mazurka]], and the [[Schottische]]. In the meantime a strong tendency emerged to drop all 'decorative' steps such as ''entrechats'' and ''ronds de jambes'' that had found a place in the Quadrilles and other dances.

=== Early 20th century ===
Modern ballroom dance has its roots early in the 20th century, when several different things happened more or less at the same time. The first was a movement away from the sequence dances towards dances where the couples moved independently. This had been pre-figured by the waltz, which had already made this transition. The second was a wave of popular music, such as [[jazz]]. Since dance is to a large extent tied to music, this led to a burst of newly invented dances. There were many dance crazes in the period 1910–1930.

The third event was a concerted effort to transform some of the dance crazes into dances which could be taught to a wider dance public in the U.S. and Europe. Here [[Vernon and Irene Castle]] were important, and so was a generation of English dancers in the 1920s, including [[Josephine Bradley]] and [[Victor Silvester]]. These professionals analysed, codified, published, and taught a number of standard dances. It was essential, if popular dance was to flourish, for dancers to have some basic movements they could confidently perform with any partner they might meet. Here the huge [[Arthur Murray]] organisation in America, and the dance societies in England, such as the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]], were highly influential. Finally, much of this happened during and after a period of World War, and the effect of such a conflict in dissolving older social customs was considerable.&lt;ref name=Franks/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson P.J S. 1948. ''The history of English ballroom dancing (1900–1945)''. London: Jenkins&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in the 1930s, the on-screen dance pairing of [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] influenced all forms of dance in the U.S. and elsewhere. Although both actors had separate careers, their filmed dance sequences together, which included portrayals of the Castles, have reached iconic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicals101.com/1930film3.htm |title=History of Musical Film, by John Kenrick |year=1996 |accessdate=2008-05-29 |publisher=Musicals101.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080511172708/http://www.musicals101.com/1930film3.htm| archivedate= 11 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Astaire and Rogers' work portrayed social dancing, although the performances were highly choreographed (often by Astaire or [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]]) and meticulously staged and rehearsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980215/REVIEWS08/401010363/1023 |title=Review of "Swing Time" (1936) |date=1998-02-15 |accessdate=2008-05-29 |publisher=[[Roger Ebert|rogerebert.com]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503164308/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19980215%2FREVIEWS08%2F401010363%2F1023 |archivedate=2008-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competitions, sometimes referred to as [[dancesport]], range from world championships, regulated by the [[World Dance Council]] (WDC), to less advanced dancers at various proficiency levels. Most competitions are divided into professional and amateur, though in the USA [[pro-am]] competitions typically accompany professional competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedstatesdancechampionships.com/ USDC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311000126/http://www.unitedstatesdancechampionships.com/ |date=2007-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Olympic Committee]] now recognizes [[competitive dance|competitive]] ballroom dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idsf.net/index.tpl?id=30 Certificate of Olympic recognition of WDSF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626010044/http://www.idsf.net/index.tpl?id=30 |date=2010-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has recognized another body, the [[World DanceSport Federation]] (WDSF), as the sole representative body for dancesport in the [[Olympic Games]]. However, it seems doubtful that dance will be included in the Olympic Games, especially in light of efforts to reduce the number of participating sports.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Ballroom dance competitions are regulated by each country in its own way. There are about 30 countries which compete regularly in international competitions. There are another 20 or so countries which have membership of the WDC and/or the WDSF, but whose dancers rarely appear in international competitions.&lt;ref&gt;Complete listings of affiliations are given in the programmes of the major competitions.&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain there is the [[British Dance Council]], which grants national and regional championship titles, such as the British Ballroom Championships, the [[British Sequence Championships]] and the United Kingdom Championships. In the United States, the member branches of the WDC (National Dance Council of America) and the WDSF ([[USA Dance]]) both grant national and regional championship titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedstatesdancechampionships.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311000126/http://www.unitedstatesdancechampionships.com/ |archivedate=2007-03-11 |df= }}  USDC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usadancenationals.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508194905/http://www.usadancenationals.com/ |archivedate=2017-05-08 |df= }} USA Dance Nationals&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballroom dancing competitions in the former USSR also included the [[Soviet Ballroom dances]], or ''Soviet Programme''. Australian [[New Vogue (dance)|New Vogue]] is danced both competitively and socially. In competition there are 15 recognised New Vogue dances, which are performed by the competitors in sequence. These dance forms are not recognised internationally, neither are the US variations such as American Smooth, and Rhythm. Such variations in dance and competition methods are attempts to meets perceived needs in the local market-place.

Internationally, the [[Blackpool Dance Festival]], hosted annually at [[Blackpool]], England, is considered the most prestigious event a dancesport competitor can attend.

[[Formation dance]] is another style of competitive dance recognised by the IDSF. In this style, multiple dancers (usually in couples and typically up to 16 dancers at one time) compete on the same team, moving in and out of various formations while dancing.

[[File:MIT 2006 Latin Intermediate.jpg|thumb|Intermediate level international style Latin dancing at the 2006 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] ballroom dance competition. A judge stands in the foreground.]]

In competitive ballroom, dancers are judged by diverse criteria such as poise, the hold or frame, posture, musicality and expression, timing, body alignment and shape, floor craft, foot and leg action, and presentation. Judging in a performance-oriented sport is inevitably subjective in nature, and controversy and complaints by competitors over judging placements are not uncommon. The scorekeepers—called scrutineers—will tally the total number recalls accumulated by each couple through each round until the finals, when the [[Skating system]] is used to place each couple by ordinals, typically 1–6, though the number of couples in the final may vary. Sometimes, up to 8 couples may be present on the floor during the finals.

Competitors dance at different levels based on their ability and experience. The levels are split into two categories, syllabus and open. The syllabus levels are newcomer/pre-bronze, bronze, silver, and gold—with gold the highest syllabus level and newcomer the lowest. In these levels, moves are restricted to those written in syllabus, and illegal moves can lead to disqualification. Each level, bronze, silver, and gold, has different moves on their syllabus, increasing in difficulty. There are three levels in the open category; novice, pre-champ, and champ in increasing order of skill. At those levels, dancers no longer have restrictions on their moves, so complex routines are more common.

=== Medal evaluations ===
Medal evaluations for amateurs enable dancers' individual abilities to be recognized according to conventional standards. In medal evaluations, which are run by bodies such as the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]] (ISTD) and the [[United Kingdom Alliance (UKA)]], each dancer performs two or more dances in a certain genre in front of a judge. Genres such as Modern Ballroom or Latin are the most popular. Societies such as the ISTD and UKA also offer medal tests on other dance styles (such as Country &amp; Western, Rock 'n Roll or Tap). In some North American examinations, levels include Newcomer, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Novice, Pre-championship, and Championship; each level may be further subdivided into either two or four separate sections.

== Collegiate ballroom ==
[[File:Colligate ballroom.jpg|right|thumb|People on the dance floor waiting to dance and compete.]]
There is a part of the ballroom world dedicated to college students. These chapters are typically clubs or teams that have an interest in ballroom dancing. Teams hold fundraisers, social events, and ballroom dance lessons. Ballroom dance teams' goals are to have fun and learn to dance well. There is a strong focus on finding a compatible dance partner and bonding with teammates. There is also a competitive side to collegiate ballroom - collegiate teams often hold competitions and invite other teams to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballroom 101|url=http://usadance.org/college/ballroom-101/|publisher=USA Dance, Inc.|accessdate=9 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413155208/http://usadance.org/college/ballroom-101/|archivedate=13 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These competitions are often run with many of the same rules are regular amateur competitions as outlined above, but are usually organized entirely by collegiate teams. Examples include the MIT Open Ballroom Dance Competition, Purdue Ballroom Classic, Cardinal Classic, Berkeley Classic, and Harvard Invitational.

== Dances ==
"Ballroom dance" refers most often to the ten dances of '''International Ballroom''' (or Standard) and '''International Latin''', though the term is also often used interchangeably with the five International Ballroom dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://linus.socs.uts.edu.au/%7Edon/pubs/modern.html| title= History of Modern Ballroom Dancing| accessdate= 2007-02-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070226125005/http://linus.socs.uts.edu.au/~don/pubs/modern.html| archivedate= 26 February 2007| deadurl= yes| df= dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sequence dancing]], which is danced predominantly in the United Kingdom, and its development [[New Vogue (dance)|New Vogue]] in Australia and New Zealand, are also sometimes included as a type of Ballroom dancing.

In the United States and Canada, the '''American Style''' ('''American Smooth''' and '''American Rhythm''') also exists. The dance technique used for both International and American styles is similar, but International Ballroom allows only [[Ballroom glossary#Closed position|closed dance positions]], whereas American Smooth allows closed, open and separated dance movements. In addition, different sets of dance figures are usually taught for the two styles. International Latin and American Rhythm have different styling, and have different dance figures in their respective syllabi.

Other dances sometimes placed under the umbrella "ballroom dance" include nightclub dances such as [[Lindy Hop]], [[West Coast swing]], [[nightclub two step]], [[Hustle (dance)|hustle]], [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]], and [[merengue (dance)|merengue]]. The categorization of dances as "ballroom dances" has always been fluid, with new dances or folk dances being added to or removed from the ballroom repertoire from time to time, so no list of subcategories or dances is any more than a description of current practices. There are other dances historically accepted as ballroom dances, and are revived via the [[vintage dance]] movement.

In Europe, Latin Swing dances include [[Argentine tango]], [[Mambo (dance)|mambo]], [[Lindy Hop]], swing boogie (sometimes also known as nostalgic boogie), and [[disco fox]]. One example of this is the subcategory of [[cajun dance]]s that originated in [[Acadiana]], with branches reaching both coasts of the United States.

Ballroom/Smooth dances are normally danced to Western music (often from the mid-twentieth century), and couples dance counter-clockwise around a rectangular floor following the [[Ballroom glossary#Line of dance|line of dance]]. In competitions, competitors are costumed as would be appropriate for a [[white tie]] affair, with full gowns for the ladies and [[bow tie]] and [[tail coat]]s for the men; though in American Smooth it is now conventional for the men to abandon the tailsuit in favor of shorter [[tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedo]]s, vests, and other creative outfits.

Latin/Rhythm dances are commonly danced to contemporary Latin American music and (in case of jive) Western music. With the exception of a few traveling dances like [[Samba (ballroom)|samba]] and [[pasodoble]], couples do not follow the line of dance but perform their routines more or less in one spot. In competitions, the women are often dressed in short-skirted Latin outfits while the men are outfitted in tight-fitting shirts and pants, the goal being to emphasize the dancers' leg action and body movements.

===Standard/Smooth===
==== Waltz ====
{{Main|Waltz (International Standard)}}
Waltz began as a country folk dance in [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]] in the 17th century. In the early 19th century it was introduced in England. It was the first dance where a man held a woman close to his body. When performing the dance, the upper body is kept to the left throughout all figures, woman's body leaves the right side of the man while the head is extended to follow the elbow. Figures with rotation have little rise. Sway is also used on the second step to make the step longer and also to slow down the momentum by bringing the feet together. Waltz is performed for both International Standard and American Smooth.

==== Viennese Waltz ====
{{Main|Viennese Waltz}}
Viennese waltz originated in [[Provence]] area in France in 1559 and is recognized as the oldest of all ballroom dances. It was introduced in England as German waltz in 1812 and became popular throughout the 19th century by the music of [[Josef Strauss|Josef]] and [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]]. It is often referred to as the classic “old-school” ballroom.Viennese Waltz music is quite fast. Slight shaping of the body moves towards the inside of the turn and shaping forward and up to lengthen the opposite side from direction. Reverse turn is used to travel down long side and is overturned. While natural turn is used to travel short side and is underturned to go around the corners. Viennese waltz is performed for both International Standard and American Smooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dancecentral.info/ballroom/international-style|title=International Style - DanceCentral.info|website=www.dancecentral.info|access-date=2017-05-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514234052/http://www.dancecentral.info/ballroom/international-style|archivedate=2017-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/americas-ballroom-challenge/ballroom-dance-styles/|title=Ballroom Dance Styles {{!}} America's Ballroom Challenge {{!}} PBS|website=Ballroom Dance Styles {{!}} America's Ballroom Challenge {{!}} PBS|access-date=2017-05-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505151122/http://www.pbs.org/americas-ballroom-challenge/ballroom-dance-styles/|archivedate=2017-05-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justdanceballroom.com/styles.html#waltz|title=Just Dance Ballroom :: Dance Styles|website=www.justdanceballroom.com|access-date=2017-05-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429183138/http://www.justdanceballroom.com/styles.html#waltz|archivedate=2017-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tango ====
{{Main|Tango}}
Tango originated in [[Buenos Aires]] in the late 19th century. Modern [[Argentine tango]] is danced in both open and closed embraces which focuses on the male leader and the women moving in harmony of the tango’s passionate charging music. The tango’s technique is like walking to the music while keeping feet grounded and allowing ankles and knees to brush against one another during each step taken. Body weight is kept over the toes and the connection is held between the man and women in the hips.

[[Ballroom tango]], however, is a dance with a far more open frame, often utilising strong and [[staccato]] movements. Ballroom tango, rather than Argentine tango, is performed in international competition.

==== Foxtrot ====
{{Main|Foxtrot}}
The foxtrot is an American dance, credited by a [[vaudeville]] performer [[Harry Fox]] in 1914. Fox was rapidly trotting step to [[ragtime]] music. The dance was originally named as the “Fox’s trot”. The foxtrot can be danced at slow, medium, or fast tempos depending on the speed of the jazz or big band music. The partners are facing one another and frame rotates from one side to another, changing direction after a measure. The dance is flat, with no rise and fall like the waltz. The walking steps are taken as slow for the two beats per steps and quick for one beat per step. Foxtrot is performed for both International Standard and American Smooth.

==== Quickstep ====
{{Main|Quickstep}}
The quickstep is an English dance and was invented in the 1920s as a combination of faster tempo of foxtrot and the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]]. It is a fast moving dance, so men are allowed to close their feet and the couples move in short syncopated steps. Quickstep includes the walks, runs, chasses, and turns of the original foxtrot dance, with some other fast figures such as locks, hops, and skips. Quick step is performed as an International Standard dance.

===Latin/Rhythm===
==== Pasodoble ====
{{Main|Pasodoble}}
The pasodoble originated from Spain and its dramatic bullfights. The dance is mostly performed only in competitions and rarely socially because of its many choreographic rules. The man plays the role of the [[Bullfighter|matador]] while the woman takes the role of the matador’s cape, the bull, or even the matador. The chassez cape refers to the man using the woman to turn her as if she is the cape, and the apel is when the man stomps his foot to get the bull's attention. Pasodoble is performed as an International Latin dance.

==== Spanish bolero ====
{{Main|Bolero (Spanish dance)}}
The Spanish bolero was developed in the late 18th century out of the ''[[seguidilla]]'', and its popularization is attributed to court dancers such as [[Sebastiano Carezo|Sebastián Cerezo]]. It became one of the most popular ballroom dances of the 19th century and saw many classical adaptations. However, by the 20th century it had become old-fashioned. A Cuban music genre of the same name, [[bolero]], which became popular in the early 20th century, is unrelated to the Spanish dance.

====Cuban bolero====
{{Main|Bolero}}
Although Cuban bolero was born as a form of ''[[trova]]'', traditional singer/songwriter tradition from eastern Cuba, with no associated dance, it soon became a ballroom favorite in Cuba and all of Latin America. The dance most commonly represents the couple falling in love. Modern bolero is seen as a combination of many dances: like a slow salsa with contra-body movement of tango, patterns of rhumba, and rise and fall technique and personality of waltz and foxtrot. Bolero can be danced in a closed hold or singly and then coming back together. It is performed as an American Rhythm dance.

==== Samba ====
{{Main|Samba (Brazilian dance)}}
Samba is the national dance of [[Brazil]]. The rhythm of samba and its name originated from the language and culture of West African slaves. In 1905, samba became known to other countries during an exhibition in Paris. In the 1940s, samba was introduced in America through [[Carmen Miranda]]. The international version of Ballroom Samba has been based on an early version of Brazilian Samba called Maxixe, but has since developed away and differs strongly from Brazilian Ballroom Samba, which is called Samba de Gafieira. International Ballroom Samba is danced with a slight bounce which is created through the bending and straightening the knee. It is performed as an International Latin dance, although most of its modern development has occurred outside Latin America.

==== Rhumba ====
{{Main|Rhumba}}
Rhumba came to the United States from Cuba in the 1920s and became a popular [[cabaret]] dance during [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. Rhumba is a ballroom adaptation of [[son cubano]] and [[bolero]] (the Cuban genre) and, despite its name, it rarely included elements of [[Cuban rumba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daniel|first1=Yvonne|editor1-last=Malnig|editor1-first=Julie|title=Ballroom, Boogie, Shimmy Sham, Shake: A Social and Popular Dance Reader|date=2009|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Chicago, IL|page=162|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zCSDBjRqC5EC|chapter=Rumba Then and Now}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes Cuban motions through knee-strengthening, figure-eight hip rotation, and swiveling foot action. An important characteristic of rhumba is the powerful and direct lead achieved through the ball of the foot. Rhumba is performed for both International Latin and American Rhythm.

==== Mambo ====
{{Main|Mambo (dance)}}
Mambo was developed as an off-shoot of [[danzón]], the national dance of Cuba, in the late 1930s by [[Orestes López]] and his brother [[Cachao]], of [[Arcaño y sus Maravillas]]. They conceived a new form of danzón influenced by [[son cubano]], with a faster, improvised final section, which allowed dancers to more freely express themselves, given that danzón had traditionally a very rigid structure. In the 1940s, [[Dámaso Pérez Prado]] transformed the mambo from the charanga into the [[big band]] format, and took it to Mexico and the United States, where it became a "dance craze".

==== Cha-cha-cha ====
{{Main|Cha-cha-cha (dance)}}
Cha-cha-cha (sometimes called cha-cha in the US) was delevoped by [[Enrique Jorrín]] in the early 1950s, as a slower alternative to mambo. Cha-cha-cha is a flirtatious dance with many hip rotations and partners synchronising their movements. The dance includes bending and straightening of the knee giving it a touch of Cuban motion. Cha-cha is performed for both International Latin and American Rhythm.

==== East Coast Swing ====
{{Main|East Coast Swing}}
Swing in 1927 was originally named the [[Lindy Hop]] named by [[George Snowden|Shorty George Snowden]]. There have been 40 different versions documented over the years; most common is the East Coast swing which is performed in the American Smooth (or American Rhythm) only in the U.S. or Canada. The East Coast swing was established by Arthur Murray and others only shortly after World War II. Swing music is very lively and upbeat and can be danced to jazz or big band music. The swing dancing is a style with lots of bounce and energy. Swing also includes many spins and underarm turns. East Coast swing is performed as an American Rhythm dance.

==== Jive ====
{{Main|Jive (dance)}}
The jive is part of the [[Swing (dance)|swing dance]] group and is a very lively variation of the [[jitterbug]]. Jive originated from African American clubs in the early 1940s. During World War II, American soldiers introduced the jive in England where it was adapted to today's competitive jive. In jive, the man leads the dance while the woman encourages the man to ask them to dance. It is danced to [[big band]] music, and some technique is taken from salsa, swing and tango. Jive is performed as an International Latin dance.

'''BotCon''', briefly known as "The Official Transformers Collectors' Convention" (or OTFCC), was an annual [[Fan convention|convention]] for [[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]] fans and collectors. BotCon has been held annually since 1994. BotCon is a [[syllabic abbreviation]] for "Robot Convention"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~sstoneb/tf/faq/fandom/conventions.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050819012607/http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~sstoneb/tf/faq/fandom/conventions.php |archivedate=2005-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also refers to "[[Autobot]]" and "[[Decepticon]]",&lt;ref name="NY Times M Ceply" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/30/movies/30botcon.html?_r=1|title=BotCon: Remaining Transfixed by Transformers|first=Michael|last=Cieply|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the protagonist and antagonist robot factions in the many continuities in the Transformers franchise.

Featured BotCon guests are usually involved in the creation of Transformers media in some respect, whether as [[voice acting|voice actors]] from the animated series, artists or writers from the [[Transformers (comics)|comic books]], or actual [[Hasbro]] employees. [[Fun Publications]] has held the convention for a number of years, with 2016 being the final year it would do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tformers.com/botcon-2016-last-transformers-convention-from-fun-publications-/28918/news.html|title=#BotCon 2016 - Last Transformers Convention From Fun Publications|first=|last=Tformers.com|website=tformers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was replaced by [[HASCON]], Hasbro's own convention in 2017.

==History==
[[Image:BotCon2006 HasbroDisplay.jpg|thumb|Display cases for upcoming Transformers at BotCon 2006]]
[[Image:BotCon2006 Costumes.jpg|thumb|Some of the many [[cosplay]]ers present at BotCon]]
The first BotCon was held in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]&lt;ref name="NY Times M Ceply" /&gt; in 1994. Organized by brothers Jon and Karl Hartman, the convention had 180 attendees. BotCon was organized in 1995 by Raksha, a prominent figure in the fan community, and in 1996 by Men In Black Productions, headed up by Dennis Barger. In 1997, the Hartmans brought Glen Hallit, a fellow fan, into the fold, forming [[3H Enterprises]] (based upon the first letter of all three organizers' last names).

In 1999, BotCon Europe took place in Clapham Common, Wandsworth, South West London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botcon.com/archive/1999e/index.html|title=BotCon Online|website=www.botcon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melted.com/bce/|title=BotCon Europe News Page|website=www.melted.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At BotCon 2002, Hallit announced that 3H had secured the official Transformers convention license, as well as licenses to produce [[comic book]]s and start a [[fan club]]. Shortly thereafter, the Hartmans were removed from their organizational duties, leaving Glen Hallit as the sole organizer of the new company, 3H Productions, Inc.

In the winter of 2002, 3H sought to expand to [[Europe]], holding an official European convention in [[Cheshunt]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Unfortunately, the event, which was held in conjunction with the main BotCon 2002 in the USA, had much less advertising and the registration did not open until a couple of weeks before the convention. Since the attendance at the European BotCon had been much smaller than the main show that summer, 3H decided it was too much work to hold two separate conventions, and officially announced that they would never hold BotCon outside the USA again.

In 2003, the convention changed its name to "The Official Transformers Collectors' Convention", OTFCC for short, due to the Hartmans' ownership of the BotCon service mark. The fandom held dueling conventions in 2004, as 3H held OTFCC in [[Chicago, Illinois]], while the Hartman brothers revived the BotCon name for their final convention in [[Pasadena, California]]. In the fall of that year, 3H Productions lost all of its Transformers-related licenses, leaving the convention in a state of limbo.

In early January 2005, [[Hasbro]] announced on its official Web site that [[Fun Publications]], owned by Brian Savage, had been awarded the convention and fan club licenses. The Hartman brothers and other prominent fans Pete Sinclair, Benson Yee, and Rik Alvarez were invited to form an advisory council to help ease the transition of organizing the convention for the new owners. Once the Hartmans' service mark was transferred to Fun Publications, BotCon regained its status of being the official Transformers collectors' convention.

==Transformers Hall of Fame==
At the 2010 BotCon, Hasbro introduced a "Hall of Fame" awards ceremony to commemorate the people and characters of the franchise. Hasbro selected the first four robot inductees, while fans worldwide voted for the fifth. In the end, Dinobot from ''[[Beast Wars: Transformers]]'' won the votes. Among the human inductees were Bob Budiansky for helping create the franchise through comics and personality profiles, Peter Cullen for giving Optimus Prime his voice, Hideaki Yoke and Kohjin Ohno of Takara Tomy for creating many of the franchise's toys.

For 2011, Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay were inducted for the success of the ''Transformers'' live-action film franchise.

In 2012, the first posthumous award was given to voice actor Chris Latta, who died in 1994. Wheeljack, one of the characters he voiced in the original series, was selected as the Fan's Choice recipient.

==Exclusive toys==
One of BotCon's most popular features is the exclusive [[toy]]s made available to the attendees. The toys are different every year and are not retailed anywhere in the world. The number of exclusive toys increased significantly in 2005 after Fun Publications became the official license holder of the convention. The identities and designs of the toys were originally kept a close secret until the opening of the convention, but in the later years of the convention the organizers often chose to reveal one or more of the exclusives ahead of time due to repeated problems with stolen [[prototype]]s being sold on [[eBay]]. In 2008, organizer Brian Savage ordered all eBay users selling these prototypes to return them to their rightful owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tformers.com/article.php?sid=9295|title=BotCon Threatens Legal Action Over Stolen Toys|first=|last=Tformers.com|website=tformers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the toys are always unique, financial costs prohibit the creation of entirely new molds. As such, the toys are [[redeco]]s, [[repaint]]s, or [[retool]]s of previously used toys given new identities, occasionally switching allegiances and even gender. Beginning in 2003, some of the exclusives were given new, retooled heads to further differentiate the new characters from previous uses of a mold. As the number of exclusives offered at each convention grew, so did the number of retooled parts. Since then, it has been standard practice to produce 3-4 newly tooled heads (or other parts such as wings in the case of 2007) for each BotCon. After the convention, exclusive toys usually become valuable collector's items in the community, particularly among fans who missed the convention.

The Transformers Collector's Club also releases exclusive figures, which are also remolds and repaints of regular ''Transformers'' figures.

A '''bridal shower''' is a gift-giving party held for a [[bride-to-be]] in anticipation of her [[wedding]].  The custom originated in the 1890s and is today most common in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and in [[India]]

The history of the custom is rooted not necessarily for the provision of goods for the upcoming matrimonial home, but to provide goods and financial assistance to ensure the wedding may take place.

==History==
The custom of the bridal shower is said to have grown out of earlier [[dowry]] practices, when a poor woman's family might not have the money to provide a dowry for her, or when a father refused to give his daughter her dowry because he did not approve of the marriage.{{Citation needed|date = May 2014}} In such situations, friends of the woman would gather together and bring gifts that would compensate for the dowry and allow her to marry the man of her choice.

The earliest stories about these events have been known to originate in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] around 1860. A frequently quoted legend traces the origin of this practice to the 16th or 17th Century [[Netherlands]]. However, there are also parallels with many dowry practices and the United States colonial or [[hope chest]] (''trousseau'') custom.&lt;ref name=SOSBOrigins&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related custom practised in medieval [[England]] was the Bride Ale: in [[William Langland|Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' (§ B.II.45) there is a reference to a ''bruydale.'' This was a feast held before the wedding day, at which the bride made beer and sold it to the guests at a high price.

In the United States, bridal showers started in urban areas in the 1890s mainly among the upper middle classes.  By the 1930s, bridal showers had spread to rural America.&lt;ref name=CinderellaDreams&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest use of this sense of the word in print may be in the [[Grand Rapids]] ''Michigan Evening Press'' 22 June 4, 1904: "The ‘shower parties’ that through mistaken hospitality the wedded couple are forced to attend ..." and may derive from the custom in Victorian times for the presents to be put inside a [[Parasol#China|parasol]], which when opened would "shower" the bride-to-be with gifts.&lt;ref name="SOSBIntro"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customs and gift-giving==
Many different customs have developed in different regions and social groups, but the basic format has been relatively unchanged for generations, and emphasizes traditional gender roles.  Sociologists like Beth Montemurro write that the ritual of the bridal shower "socializes women into the hyper-feminized traditional wife role," with its emphasis on the future role of the bride-to-be as family cook, homemaker, and sexual partner.&lt;ref name=SOSB_PlanningGuides&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Beth | last = Montemurro
 | title=Something Old, Something Bold |year=2006 |publisher=Rutgers University Press | isbn=0-8135-3811-4
 | pages = 20, 26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian Elizabeth Pleck echoes this dynamic in pointing out that traditional shower gifts were "for the bedroom or the kitchen."&lt;ref&gt;Pleck, Elizabeth (2000).  ''Celebrating the Family: Ethnicity, Consumer Culture and Family Rituals'', p. 213. Harvard University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;  But this role is more of an homage to the mothers and grandmothers than a reflection of how the bride-to-be will actually behave in the marriage.&lt;ref name=SOSBGenderRoles&gt;{{cite book |first=Beth |last=Montemurro |title=Something Old, Something Bold |year=2006 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=0813538114 |chapter=Origins of Bridal Showers and Bachelorette Parties }}pp. 8 - 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the format has remained relatively consistent, there have been some significant changes.  An etiquette guide from the 1920s suggested showers should be "purely spontaneous and informal," with guests arriving unannounced at the bride-to-be's home, while a planning guide from the 1950s suggests more complex themes and games.&lt;ref name="SOSB_PlanningGuides"/&gt;

Showers are often held during the afternoon or evening, but not generally as luncheons or [[Party#Dinner party|dinner parties]].  They commonly take place four to six weeks before the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Otnes, Cele C.; Pleck, Elizabeth H.. "The Engagement Complex". Cinderella Dreams: The Allure of the Lavish Wedding. University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-24008-1}}.p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the prior history of showers being "purely spontaneous and informal", showers have not developed the same formal etiquette that has developed with respect to weddings.  Invitations may be issued informally, by mail, telephone, or e-mail.

As showers are explicitly a gift-giving occasion, everyone who attends the shower is expected to bring a small gift.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7432-4417-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin, Judith |title=Miss Manners' Guide to Rearing Perfect Children |publisher=Fireside Books |location=New York |year=2002 |page=35 |isbn=0-7432-4417-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People who decline the invitation for any reason are not expected to send a gift or otherwise participate in the party. The hosts are expected to hand over gifts, or [[Party favor|favors]]. These can be small gifts like chocolate coins that have been personalized with the name of the bride and the date of the event or a simple thank-you message.

Food can be served at bridal showers. Treats such as cake and [[Candybuffet|candy buffets]] can also be served for guests.

==Hosts==
Hosting the bridal shower falls to one or more close friends of the bride, often one or more of the [[bridesmaid]]s.  Mothers, sisters, and other close family members usually do not host bridal showers, as it may be seen as rude and greedy for the family to ask for gifts for their own members.&lt;ref name="isbn0-609-60431-7"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of a bridal shower, family members and future in-laws who wish to celebrate the upcoming wedding host a bridal tea, [[Bachelorette party#Alternatives|bridesmaids' luncheon]], [[engagement party|engagement announcement party]], or other non-gift-oriented party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/miss-manners-fishing-for-an-invitation-requires-the-right-bait/2014/05/20/a94f114c-dd23-11e3-b745-87d39690c5c0_story.html|title = Miss Manners|last = Martin|first = Judith|date = 5 June 2014|work = The Washington Post|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some organizations, such as social clubs or religious groups, host bridal showers for every member who is being married.

==Guests==
Guests are chosen from among the bride's personal friends, family, and other well-wishers. Men are not usually present at bridal showers.

The number of guests and their relationship to the bride varies widely.  In Canada, among some immigrant communities parties in community halls with upwards of 300 guests were normal, while other cultures emphasized intimate parties with only close friends and relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | page=74
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, people who are invited to a bridal shower are also invited to the wedding ceremony.

==Global prevalence and alternatives==
Though many cultures have events before the wedding, bridal showers are most common in the United States and Canada.  

In the [[United Kingdom]], bridal showers have been described as a "consumerist American idea" with "limited acceptability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In India, [[Mehndi]] is a bridal-centric pre-wedding event where the bride's female friends and family gather to prepare the bride for the wedding. In the event the bride's traditional henna tattoos are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.culturalindia.net/weddings/wedding-rituals/mehndi-ceremony.html|title=All About Mehndi Ceremony!|author=|date=|website=culturalindia.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark, the only pre-wedding events commonly held is a [[bachelorette party]] for the bride and a [[bachelor party]] for the groom, both called [[polterabend]].

The '''Bruce campaign''' was a three-year military campaign by [[Edward Bruce]], brother of the Scottish king [[Robert the Bruce]], in Ireland. It lasted from his landing at [[Larne]] in 1315 to his defeat and death in 1318 at the [[Battle of Faughart]] in [[County Louth]].

After his victory at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]], Robert decided to expand his war against the English by sending an army under his younger brother Edward to invade Ireland. Another reason for the expedition was that supporters of the exiled [[House of Balliol]] had fled to Ireland after fighting at Bannockburn and remained a dangerous threat. These men were led by [[John of Argyll|John MacDougall of Lorn]], who was the cousin of [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch]], nephew of King [[John Balliol]]. The murder of Comyn in 1306 had set off a bloody civil war for the throne of Scotland which King Robert had all but won at Bannockburn and was now attempting to finish by capturing their last remaining stronghold. Robert was also invited by some of the native Irish to send an army to drive out the Norman settlers and in return they would crown his brother [[High King of Ireland]]. This campaign to revive the High Kingship effectively ended with Edward's defeat and death in the [[Battle of Faughart]] in 1318.

==Historical background==
By the early 14th century, [[Ireland]] had not had a [[List of High Kings of Ireland|High King]] since [[Ruaidri mac Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]] (Rory O'Conor) who had been deposed by his son in 1186. Further, the [[Plantagenet dynasty]] had claimed a right to take control of Ireland by the papal document ''[[Laudabiliter]]'' in 1155 and indirectly ruled much of the eastern part of the island. The country was divided between the [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] dynasties that survived the Norman invasion and the [[Hiberno-Norman]] [[Lordship of Ireland]].&lt;ref name=Shama&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/ireland_invasion_01.shtml Shama, Simon, "Invasions of Ireland from 1170 - 1320", BBC - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1258 some of the Gaelic aristocrats elected [[Brian Ua Néill]] High King; however, he was defeated by the Normans at the [[Battle of Downpatrick]] in 1260.

==The invasion of Ireland==
In 1315 [[Robert the Bruce]], King of Scots, sent his younger brother [[Edward Bruce]] to invade Ireland.  Bruce's main mission in invading Ireland was to create a second front in the [[First Scottish War of Independence|ongoing war against Norman England]], draining her of much needed men, materials and finance by creating havoc on the island,&lt;ref name=Shama/&gt; as well as depriving her of the Irish tax revenues contributing to the war effort. This became critical when King Robert's control of the [[Isle of Man]] was lost to Norman-backed Scots in January 1315, thereby threatening the south and southwest of Scotland and also reopening up a potential source of aid to England from the [[Hiberno-Normans]] and [[Gael]]ic Irish.

Added to this was a request for aid from the [[Kings of Tír Eógain|King of Tír Eógain]] (Tyrone), Domnall mac Brian Ó Néill (Donall Ó Néill). Ó Néill had been troubled by Norman incursions to the southeast (the de Verdons), the east (tenants of the [[Earl of Ulster]]) and west (also by the Earl of Ulster) of Tír Eógain and to retain his lands, he and some twelve of his vassals and allies jointly asked for aid from Scotland. The Bruce brothers agreed, on condition that they would support Edward as King of Ireland, as the brothers envisaged themselves as separate rulers of Scotland and Ireland, while Robert would regain Man and Edward possibly make an attack on Wales, with Welsh support. They personally envisioned "a grand Gaelic alliance against England" between Scotland and Ireland, since both countries had a common heritage, language and culture.

Ó Néill approved of the conditions for himself and on behalf of his vassals, and preparations began. At about this point, [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March]], received news from Irish sources that an invasion was about to take place, and made his way to Ireland where he held land, mainly in and around the castle and town of [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]]. He had previously fought against the Bruces at [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] where he was taken prisoner and freed to return King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]'s royal seal, lost in the rout.

The Scottish Parliament met at [[Ayr]] on 26 April 1315, just across the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]] from [[County Antrim|Antrim]]. As King Robert did not yet have a legitimate son, Edward was proclaimed his legal heir and successor as King of Scots and all other titles in case of his death. Edward's invasion fleet also mustered there, having received calls to assemble as far back as at least the previous month.

==The campaign of 1315==
On 26 May 1315 Edward and his fleet (and more than 5,000 men) landed on the Irish coast at points at and between [[Olderfleet Castle]] at [[Larne]],&lt;ref name=Joyce&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/JoyceHistory/Bruce.php Joyce, P.W., "Edward Bruce (1315-1318)", ''A Concise History of Ireland'', Dublin, 1909]&lt;/ref&gt; and Glendrum. His brother had sailed from [[Tarbert, Argyll|Tarbert]] for the Western Isles with his son-in-law Walter Stewart, to subjugate them till ''"all the isles, great and small, were brought to his will."'' Edward faced by an army led by vassals and confederates of the [[Earl of Ulster]], the de Mandevilles, [[Bissets of the Glens]], Logans, and [[Savage family (Ireland)|Savages]], as well as their Irish allies, overall led by Sir Thomas de Mandeville. However they were defeated in battle by the Scots under [[Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray|Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray]]. Subsequently, the Scots managed to take the town, though not the castle, of [[Carrickfergus]].

In early June, Donall [[O'Neill dynasty|Ó Néill of Tyrone]] and some twelve fellow northern Kings and lords met Edward Bruce&lt;ref name=Joyce/&gt; at Carrickfergus and swore fealty to him as [[King of Ireland]]. The Irish annals state that Bruce "''took the hostages and lordship of the whole province of Ulster without opposition and they consented to him being proclaimed King of Ireland and all the Gaels of Ireland agreed to grant him lordship and they called him King of Ireland."'' At this point Bruce directly or indirectly ruled much of eastern and mid-Ulster.

In late June, Edward proceeded with his army from Carrickfergus along Magh Line ([[Six Mile Water]]), burning Rathmore, near [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim town]], which was a holding of the Savages. He then went south by way of the Moiry Pass – called ''"Innermallan"/"Enderwillane"/Imberdiolan"'' in contemporary accounts – between [[Newry]] and [[Dundalk]]. This ancient routeway had been for centuries the passage south out of Ulster into the [[Kingdom of Mide]], [[Leinster]] and [[Munster]] but because of its narrowness Ulster armies had frequently ambushed and been ambushed at the pass. Here he was met by Mac Duilechain of Clanbrassil and Mac Artain of Iveagh, both of whom had submitted to him at Carrickfergus. Their attempted ambush ended in their defeat and the army pressed on, destroying de Verdon's fortress of Castleroache, and on 29 June attacked [[Dundalk]].&lt;ref name=Joyce/&gt; The town, another possession of the de Verdon's, was almost totally destroyed with its population, both Anglo-Irish and Gaelic, massacred alike.

In July, two separate armies opposing Bruce met and assembled at Sliabh Breagh, south of [[Ardee]]. One was led out of [[Connacht]] by [[Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster]] and his ally, the King of Connacht, [[Felim mac Aedh Ua Conchobair]]. The second consisted of forces raised in [[Munster]] and [[Leinster]] by the Justicier [[Edmund Butler, Earl of Carrick|Edmund Butler]]. The Scots-Irish army was located at Inniskeen, ten miles north. In between Sliabh Breagh and Inniskeen was the village of Louth. De Burgh moved his army north of Louth and set up camp while his cousin, William Liath de Burgh attempted to ambush Bruce's forces. While some skirmishing did result in a number of Scots deaths, Bruce refused to give battle and instead, with the Ó Néill, retreated northwards to [[Coleraine]] via [[Armagh]]. Bruce and Ó Néill sacked and burned Coleraine, threw down the bridge over the river Bann and faced off de Burgh's pursuing army on the opposite bank. While both sides now were experiencing shortages of food and supplies, Bruce and Ó Néill could at least draw support from local lords such as Ó Cathain and Ó Floinn. Mindful of this, de Burgh eventually withdrew back forty miles to Antrim, while Butler had to return to Ormond due to lack of supplies.

In addition to this, Bruce sent separate messages both to King Felim and a rival dynast, Cathal Ua Conchobair, promising to support them if they withdrew. Cathal managed to return to Connacht and had himself proclaimed king, leaving Felim with no choice but to return to put down his rebellion. Worst was to follow: De Burgh found himself deprived of not two but three allies and their armies when his kinsman, Walter mac Walter Cattach Burke deserted back to Connacht at the head of several hundred men, probably to guard his own estates from the upcoming conflict. Thus when in August Bruce and his men crossed the Bann (in four ships supplied by Scots sea captain, [[Thomas Dun]]), de Burgh retreated still further to [[Connor, County Antrim|Connor]], where on either the first or ninth of September a charge by the Scots-Irish led to his defeat. William Liath was captured and taken as hostage to Scotland by Moray who arrived there on 15 September 1315 to raise more troops, ''"his ships filled with booty."'' De Burgh retreated back to Connacht, while other Anglo-Irish took refuge in [[Carrickfergus Castle]].

Finally apprised of the seriousness of the situation, Edward II had on 1 September ordered an assembly of the leading Anglo-Irish, which met at [[Parliament of Ireland|Parliament]] in Dublin in late October, but no decisive action was taken. On 13 November, Bruce marched further south via Dundalk – where, incredibly, ''"some gave them the right hand"'', i.e., a fight – garrisoned Nobber on the 30th, and advanced to Kells, where he was met by Mortimer. Mortimer had managed to raise a large force consisting both of his Anglo-Irish and Gaelic vassals, in addition to forces of other magnates. At the same time, Bruce was reinforced by Moray who had returned from Scotland with around five hundred fresh troops and supplies. The [[Battle of Kells]] was fought on the sixth or seventh of November, with Mortimer being decisively defeated by Bruce. Mortimer was forced to retreat to Dublin while his lieutenant, Walter Cusack, held out at Trim. He almost immediately set sail for England to urge Edward II for reinforcements. At the same time, Governor of Ireland (and [[Bishop of Ely]]) [[John Hotham (bishop)|John de Hothum]] began to take drastic action to defend Dublin from Bruce, such as levelling entire tenements and churches to use the stones to reinforce their walls.&lt;ref name=Shama/&gt;

After sacking and burning Kells, Bruce proceeded to do the same to [[Granard]], Finnea, the [[Cistercian]] monastery of [[Abbeylara]] and raided [[Angaile]] ({{Not a typo|Annaly}}), the lordship of Gaelic lord O Hanely. Bruce spent Christmas at de Verdon's manor of [[Ballymore, County Westmeath|Loughsewdy]], consuming its supplies entirely and before leaving, razing it to the ground. The only manors left alone belonged to Irish lords intimidated to join him, or that of a junior branch of the de Lacy family who in an effort to gain lands voluntarily joined him.

==Remonstrance of 1317==
{{anchor|Remonstrance}}&lt;!-- [[Irish Remonstrance of 1317]] redirects here --&gt;
In 1317 Edward's Irish allies sent a remonstrance to [[Pope John XXII]] asking him to revoke ''[[Laudabiliter]]'' and mentioning Edward as King of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T310000-001/index.html 1317 remonstrance text; accessed January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Pope John ignored the request.
:"And that we may be able to attain our purpose more speedily and fitly in this respect, we call to our help and assistance Edward de Bruyis, illustrious earl of Carrick, brother of Robert by the grace of God most illustrious king of the Scots, who is sprung from our noblest ancestors.

:"And as it is free to anyone to renounce his right and transfer it to another, all the right which is publicly known to pertain to us in the said kingdom as its true heirs, we have given and granted to him by our letters patent, and in order that he may do therein judgment and justice and equity which through default of the prince [i.e. [[Edward II of England]]] have utterly failed therein, we have unanimously established and set him [Edward Bruce] up as our king and lord in our kingdom aforesaid, for in our judgment and the common judgment of men he is pious and prudent, humble and chaste, exceedingly temperate, in all things sedate and moderate, and possessing power (God on high be praised) to snatch us mightily from the house of bondage with the help of God and our own justice, and very willing to render to everyone what is due to him of right, and above all is ready to restore entirely to the Church in Ireland the possessions and liberties of which she was damnably despoiled, and he intends to grant greater liberties than ever otherwise she has been wont to have."

==Defeat in 1318==
After several years of mobile warfare, Bruce and his allies failed to hold areas that they had conquered. His army fed itself by [[War loot|pillaging]], which caused increasing unpopularity. The pan-European [[Great Famine of 1315–1317]] affected Ireland also, and disease became widespread in his army, causing it to shrink, and he was defeated and killed at the end of 1318 at the [[Battle of Faughart]] in [[County Louth]].

==The campaign in fiction==
This campaign has sometimes been dealt with briefly or not at all in accounts of the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], but there are a few exceptions.

The campaign is described in books 14 to 16 of Barbour's epic poem ''[[The Brus]]'', written within living memory of the events it describe.

In [[Nigel Tranter]]'s novel ''The Price of the King's Peace'', the third part of his [[Robert the Bruce]] trilogy, the campaign, and particularly Robert's visit to Ireland to support his brother, are described at significant length.  Edward Bruce is shown as out of his depth during his invasion of Ireland, there may be some truth in this, although the novel could exaggerate his lack of competence and differences between the two brothers.

The invasion of 1315 also forms the backdrop of a series of novels by Tim Hodkinson, ''Lions of the Grail'' and ''The Waste Land''

The '''Buncefield fire''' was a major [[conflagration]] caused by a series of [[explosion|explosions]] on 11 December 2005 at the [[Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal]],&lt;ref name="Buncefield tank 'was overflowing' "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4752819.stm|title=Buncefield tank 'was overflowing' |date=9 May 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; an oil storage facility located near the [[M1 motorway]] by [[Hemel Hempstead]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England.&lt;ref name="Can sound really travel 200 miles?"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4521232.stm|title=Can sound really travel 200 miles?|date=13 December 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Massive blaze rages at fuel depot " /&gt; The terminal was the fifth largest oil-products storage depot in the United Kingdom, with a capacity of about {{convert|60|e6impgal}} of fuel.&lt;ref name="Massive blaze rages at fuel depot " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Total liable for Buncefield blast " /&gt; The terminal is owned by [[Total S.A.|TOTAL UK Limited]] (60%) and [[Texaco]] (40%).&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fire Rages After Blasts At Oil Depot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trial starts for Buncefield compensation claims" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Total"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.total.com/en/corporate-social-responsibility/Safety-1/Buncefield_9238.htm |title=Buncefield Fire |publisher=Total |accessdate=11 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228232747/http://www.total.com/en/corporate-social-responsibility/Safety-1/Buncefield_9238.htm |archivedate=28 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incident ==

=== Explosion and fire ===
[[File:buncefield2.jpg|thumb|The fire seen from a vantage point between the Northgate and [[3Com|3Com Corporation]] buildings]]
The first and largest explosion occurred at 06:01 UTC on Sunday, 11 December 2005 near container 912.&lt;ref name="Fire Rages After Blasts At Oil Depot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HEMEL HEMPSTEAD AREA" /&gt; Further explosions followed which eventually overwhelmed 20 large storage tanks.&lt;ref name="How Buncefield fire unfolded" /&gt;
From all accounts, it seems to have been an unconfined vapour cloud explosion of unusually high strength{{snd}}also known as a [[Thermobaric weapon|fuel-air explosion]].&lt;ref name="Buncefield parallels drawn abroad" /&gt; Because of an [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion layer]], the explosions were heard up to {{convert|125|mi|km|-1}} away; there were reports that they were audible in Belgium, France, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Can sound really travel 200 miles?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fire Rages After Blasts At Oil Depot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Five firms charged over oil blast " /&gt;

The British Geological Survey monitored the event, which measured 2.4 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]].&lt;ref name="Total liable for Buncefield blast " /&gt;&lt;ref name="HEMEL HEMPSTEAD AREA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Five firms charged over oil blast " /&gt; It was reported that people were woken in south London, and as far west as [[Wokingham (borough)|Wokingham]] (about {{convert|28|mi|km}}), where in its southern suburb, [[Finchampstead]], numerous people felt the shockwave after the initial explosion. Subsequent explosions occurred at 06:27 and 06:28.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fire Rages After Blasts At Oil Depot" /&gt;

Witnesses many miles from the terminal observed flames hundreds of feet high; the smoke cloud was visible from space, and from as far north as [[Lincolnshire]] (about {{convert|70|mi|km}}) away.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt; Damage from the blasts included broken windows at various buildings including the  Holy Trinity church and [[Leverstock Green]] School, blown-in or warped front doors, and an entire wall being removed from a warehouse more than half a mile (800&amp;nbsp;m) from the site.&lt;ref name="Report 6 May" /&gt; Buildings in neighbouring [[St Albans]] also suffered; [[Townsend Church of England School|Townsend School]] had serious blast damage, and a window was blown out of [[St Albans Cathedral|St Albans Abbey]] (about {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} away).&lt;ref name="HEMEL HEMPSTEAD AREA" /&gt;

Several nearby office blocks were hit so badly that almost every window, front and back, was blown in as the explosion ripped through them.&lt;ref name="Buncefield victims in court move" /&gt; The timing of the explosion before work hours possibly prevented additional casualties. Reports also indicated that cars in nearby streets caught fire. The roof of at least one house was blown off.&lt;ref name="Report 6 May" /&gt; Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, not only because of the smoke and possibility of more explosions, but because of the danger of structural damage making the buildings unstable.&lt;ref name="HEMEL HEMPSTEAD AREA" /&gt;

There were 43&amp;nbsp;reported injuries; two people were deemed to be seriously injured enough to be kept in hospital, one in [[Watford General Hospital]], with breathing difficulties, and another in [[Hemel Hempstead Hospital]], although they were not in a life-threatening condition.&lt;ref name="Total liable for Buncefield blast " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Five firms charged over oil blast " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Total negligent over blast at Buncefield" /&gt; Some early media reports spoke of eight fatalities, but these may have been persons missing. All members of staff from the terminal were accounted for.&lt;ref name="Massive blaze rages at fuel depot " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Report 6 May" /&gt;

Hertfordshire police and fire services and the member of parliament for the area, [[Mike Penning]], said that there were seven fuel tanks on the site which, as of 14:00 on 12 December, had not been affected. These tanks were at risk of exploding if the fire were to spread.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buncefield parallels drawn abroad"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/file_on_4/4709666.stm|title=Buncefield parallels drawn abroad|date=14 February 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tackling the blaze ===
[[File:Hemel Hempstead fuel explosion map.jpg|thumb|This satellite photo shows black smoke from the explosion spreading in two main streams from the explosion site at the apex of the inverted 'v'. By the time the fire had been extinguished the smoke had reached the [[English Channel]]. The orange dot is a marker, not the actual fire.]]
The emergency services announced a major emergency at 06:08 and a tremendous fire fighting effort began. At peak times this effort consisted of 25&amp;nbsp;fire engines, 20&amp;nbsp;support vehicles and 180&amp;nbsp;fire fighters.&lt;ref name="How Buncefield fire unfolded" /&gt; 

Around 150&amp;nbsp;firefighters were called immediately to the incident, and began tackling the blaze at 08:20 on the morning of 11 December, putting in containment measures before applying a large quantity of foam.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smoke of British Oil Depot Fire Reaches France" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buncefield oil depot fires extinguished" /&gt; The incident occurred close to junction 8 of the M1 motorway, which led to its closure and the setting up of a public exclusion area.&lt;ref name="Massive blaze rages at fuel depot" /&gt; It was estimated that this incident would be the largest "single-seat" fire in the world ever to be fought by a fire brigade, and foam supplies from sites all over the UK were drawn upon.&lt;ref name="Massive blaze rages at fuel depot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fire Rages After Blasts At Oil Depot"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/20080641205711 |title=Fire Rages After Blasts At Oil Depot |date=11 December 2005 |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=19 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304194154/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/20080641205711 |archivedate=4 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans had been in place to start using foam at midnight on 11 December, but were delayed by last-minute concerns over possible pollution of local rivers and underlying water sources.&lt;ref name="Report 6 May" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Questions still unanswered in Buncefield probe" /&gt; Six high volume pumps were used to extract {{convert|25000|l|impgal|0}} of water per minute{{snd}}{{convert|417|l|impgal|0}} per second{{snd}}from a reservoir {{convert|1.5|mi|km|0}} from the fire, with six more high volume pumps deployed at various locations to serve as boosters. Thirty-two thousand litres (7,039 imp gal) of [[fire fighting foam]] per minute were directed against the fire for just over four hours, after which the pumping rate was reduced.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt; Half of the 20&amp;nbsp;individual fires were reported extinguished by midday.&lt;ref name="Smoke of British Oil Depot Fire Reaches France" /&gt;

By 16:30 on Monday 12 December, it was reported that a further two tank fires had been extinguished, but that one of the tanks extinguished earlier had ruptured and re-ignited, and was now threatening to cause the explosion of an adjacent tank.&lt;ref name="Buncefield oil depot fires extinguished" /&gt; This led to the M1 motorway being closed again; the public exclusion area was widened, and firefighters were temporarily withdrawn until the risk posed by the threatened tank could be assessed.&lt;ref name="Massive blaze rages at fuel depot " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fire Rages After Blasts At Oil Depot" /&gt;

Firefighting operations were resumed at about 20:00, and it was anticipated that all fires could be extinguished during the night. Further damage occurred to one of the storage tanks in the early hours of Tuesday morning, causing firefighters to be withdrawn once again, but operations resumed at 08:30.&lt;ref name="Fire at Hertfordshire oil depot is contained"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1211/buncefield.html|title=Fire at Hertfordshire oil depot is contained|date=11 December 2005|publisher=RTÉ News|accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By midday on 13 December, all but three fires had been extinguished, although the largest tank was still burning.&lt;ref name="Buncefield oil depot fires extinguished"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1213/buncefield.html|title=Buncefield oil depot fires extinguished|date=13 December 2005|publisher=RTÉ News|accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gold Silver Bronze command structure|Bronze command]]{{snd}}operations on the ground{{snd}}was visited by the [[Bishop of St Albans]], the local vicar, and the industrial chaplain supporting the fire crews, to see how they were coping.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt;

Firefighters were confident that the remaining fires could be extinguished during the day on Tuesday, 13 December.&lt;ref name="Buncefield oil depot fires extinguished" /&gt; The smoke plume had been considerably reduced and was more grey, indicating the amount of vapourised water now combining with the smoke. It was reported at 16:45 that all tank fires had been extinguished, although some smaller fires persisted.&lt;ref name="Buncefield oil depot fires extinguished" /&gt; 75% of firefighters for Hertfordshire were involved in fighting the fire, supported by 16&amp;nbsp;other brigades. The entire gold command operation, involving many agencies as well as all the emergency services, was run from [[Hertfordshire Constabulary]]'s headquarters in [[Welwyn Garden City]], some distance from the fire.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt;

A further fire broke out during the early morning of 14 December. Firefighters were of the view that extinguishing it would leave the risk of petroleum vapour re-igniting or exploding, so it would be better to allow the fire, which was well contained, to burn itself out.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt; Hertfordshire Fire Service's deputy chief Mark Yates stated that escaping petroleum vapour was the most likely cause of the original explosion and fire.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buncefield parallels drawn abroad" /&gt;

=== Smoke cloud ===
[[File:BuncefieldFire.jpg|thumb|The smoke plume seen from [[Dunsmore, Buckinghamshire]], about {{convert|20|mi|km}} away]]
The black smoke cloud, which was visible from satellite photographs, drifted at a high altitude, around {{convert|9000|ft|m}}, towards [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and [[Swindon]], and could be seen across much of [[South East England]].&lt;ref name="Smoke cloud spreading over South"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4518500.stm|title=Smoke cloud spreading over South|date=11 December 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small particles in the smoke contained [[hydrocarbon]]s, which can be an irritant but have a low toxicity and were not expected to cause any long-term harm.&lt;ref name="Report 6 May" /&gt; The [[Met Office]] issued warnings that the smoke in the atmosphere could come down in rainfall during the night of 11 December.&lt;ref name="Smoke cloud spreading over South" /&gt;

The fire resulted in 244&amp;nbsp;people requiring medical aid{{snd}}mainly on the first day of the fire.&lt;ref name="Report 6 May" /&gt; From those 117 had symptoms attributable to the incident, of whom 38 were members of the public. The majority of those visiting hospitals were from the rescue services and attended for precautionary check ups. Most of them had no symptoms, except for 63 emergency workers who suffered respiratory complaints, of which half were sore throats.&lt;ref name="Report 6 May" /&gt;

For the first two days of the fire, the high thermal energy made the [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] highly buoyant; this, together with settled weather conditions, allowed the plume to rise to a great height with little cross-mixing. When the fire was reduced in intensity it was reported to be possible that the plume would be less buoyant and that ground-level smoke concentrations could then rise significantly.&lt;ref name="Fire at Hertfordshire oil depot is contained" /&gt; By 12 December, it was reported that the smoke cloud had reached northern France; it was expected to arrive in northern Spain by the weekend.&lt;ref name="Smoke of British Oil Depot Fire Reaches France"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/?hn=27449 |title=Smoke of British Oil Depot Fire Reaches France |date=12 December 2005 |publisher=Today's Zaman |accessdate=17 October 2009 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To investigate the smoke cloud the [[Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements]], a research aircraft operated jointly by [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]] and the Met Office, made two flights on 12 and 13 December. In the first flight the edge of the plume was followed along the south coast of England. [[Carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen oxide]]s and [[ozone]] concentrations were found to be low with [[Particulate#Black carbon|soot particles]] being the major component in the cloud. The second flight went into the centre of the plume to obtain data to help forecasting and emergency teams.&lt;ref name="Fire Rages After Blasts At Oil Depot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Report 6 May" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nercp1"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Natural Environment Research Council]] |accessdate=17 October 2009 |url=http://www.nerc.ac.uk/press/releases/2005/explosion.asp |title=Oil depot explosion |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709022058/http://www.nerc.ac.uk/press/releases/2005/explosion.asp |archivedate=9 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nercp2"&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Oil depot explosion{{snd}}update|author=Natural Environment Research Council}}&lt;!-- removed url as a dead link on 2009-10-17--&gt; Oil depot explosion{{snd}}update.

== Reactions and response ==

=== Evacuations and closures ===
[[File:Buncefield3.jpg|thumb|left|Smoke from the blast, visible from [[Hemel Hempstead]], above the closed M1 motorway.]]
Hundreds of homes in the Hemel Hempstead area were evacuated, and about 2,000&amp;nbsp;people had to find alternative accommodation; emergency services asked residents of the smoke-affected areas to close their windows and doors and to stay inside.&lt;ref name="Massive blaze rages at fuel depot " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smoke of British Oil Depot Fire Reaches France" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fire at Hertfordshire oil depot is contained" /&gt;

Hertfordshire Constabulary advised people who had houses with smashed windows to seek refuge with friends or family nearby if possible.&lt;ref name="Massive blaze rages at fuel depot " /&gt; Some people whose homes were damaged by the blast were placed in hotels, while others stayed in a nearby shopping centre.&lt;ref name="Buncefield victims in court move" /&gt; Total, the operator of the Buncefield depot, set up a helpline for people whose properties had been damaged by the explosion, and called in local authorities and the [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]] to provide accommodation or other help.&lt;ref name="Buncefield victims in court move" /&gt;

Concerns for public safety resulted in about 227&amp;nbsp;schools, libraries, and other public buildings across Hertfordshire and [[Buckinghamshire]] closing on 12 and 13 December.&lt;ref name="Massive blaze rages at fuel depot " /&gt;&lt;ref name="hertsdirect"&gt;{{cite web |author = [[Hertfordshire County Council]] |accessdate = 13 December 2005 |url = http://www.hertsdirect.org.uk |title = Buncefield Depot Explosion{{snd}}services affected }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police and local authorities advised residents to consult the ''Hertfordshire Direct'' website for up-to-date information.&lt;ref name="hertsdirect" /&gt;

Seventy-eight schools in [[Luton]] borough were closed on 13 December, along with a limited number of schools in [[Bedfordshire]],&lt;ref name="Massive blaze rages at fuel depot " /&gt; on the advice of Hertfordshire's Health Protection Agency that all schools within a {{convert|10|mi|km|sing=on}} radius of the incident site should be closed because of concerns surrounding the effect of the smoke plume on children's health. Schools reopened as normal on 14 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.luton.gov.uk/internet/references/news/news%20archive/2005%20news%20releases/december%202005/Schools%20in%20Luton%20to%20clos | title=Luton schools re-open | publisher=[[Politics in Luton|Luton Borough Council]] | date=13 December 2005 | accessdate=16 May 2007}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport disruption ===
The incident occurred close to junction 8 of the M1 motorway.&lt;ref name="Massive blaze rages at fuel depot " /&gt; The motorway was shut between junctions 12 and 6a{{snd}}about {{convert|18|mi|km|0}}{{snd}}shortly after the incident. Other roads in the vicinity, including the short [[M10 motorway (Great Britain)|M10 motorway]] (now part of the [[A414 road]]), were also closed.&lt;ref name="Massive blaze rages at fuel depot " /&gt;

Some local petrol stations reported long queues as people started panic buying. A spokesman for the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] gave assurances that no petrol shortage was likely to result from the incident.&lt;ref name="Massive blaze rages at fuel depot " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fire Rages After Blasts At Oil Depot" /&gt;

The oil terminal supplied 30% of [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]]'s fuel, and because of the fire, the airport had to start rationing fuel.&lt;ref name="Can sound really travel 200 miles?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oil fire leads to plane pitstops"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/4534014.stm|title=Oil fire leads to plane pitstops|date=16 December 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some long-haul flights to Australia, the Far East, and South Africa had to make an intermediate stop at [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted Airport]] or other European airports to refuel, while short-haul operators were asked to fuel their aircraft for the round trip before flying to Heathrow.&lt;ref name="Oil fire leads to plane pitstops" /&gt; Some aircraft were only allowed 40% of the fuel they would normally take on board. Fuel shortages continued for months after the explosion.&lt;ref name="Oil fire leads to plane pitstops" /&gt;

=== Business disruption ===
In the Maylands industrial area the worst affected buildings were the [[Northgate Information Solutions]] headquarters and the [[Fujifilm]] building. These buildings were so badly damaged they were rendered completely unusable.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt; Demolition of the Fujifilm building began soon afterwards, and by June 2006 it had been completely removed from the site.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt; Although the Northgate and Fujifilm buildings were closest to the blast, the surrounding Catherine House (to the north), Keystone Distribution building (to the west), [[3Com|3Com Corporation]] and RO buildings (to the south), were also extensively damaged.&lt;ref name="Oil blaze hits hospital systems "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cambridgeshire/4521608.stm|title=Oil blaze hits hospital systems |date=12 December 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, six buildings were designated for demolition and 30 more required major repairs before they could be reoccupied.&lt;ref name="Hertfordshire County Council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hertsdirect.org/infobase/docs/pdfstore/bunmulti.pdf|title=Multi-Agency Recovery Plan|date=January 2006|publisher=Hertfordshire County Council|accessdate=1 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609121902/http://www.hertsdirect.org/infobase/docs/pdfstore/bunmulti.pdf|archivedate=9 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the destruction of the equipment in the Northgate building several websites hosted there were inaccessible{{snd}}including that of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. [[Addenbrooke's Hospital]] in Cambridge was also affected; its IT system dealing with admissions and discharges had to be replaced for several days by a manual system.&lt;ref name="Oil blaze hits hospital systems " /&gt;

A number of companies were affected by inability to reach their premises even where the premises themselves were largely unaffected by the blast.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt; Criticism was expressed by local citizens and the local MP that originally the depot had been constructed away from other buildings, but that developmental pressures had led to both houses and commercial premises being built near the depot.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buncefield victims in court move" /&gt;

=== Groundwater pollution ===
In May 2006 [[Veolia Water Central Limited|Three Valleys Water]] announced that it had detected the persistent, [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulative]], and toxic [[fluorosurfactant]] [[Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid|perfluorooctane sulfonate]] (PFOS){{snd}}which is used in fire fighting foam{{snd}}in a ground water bore hole close to the Buncefield site.&lt;ref name="Report 6 May" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Fluorochemical Dilemma"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ullah|first=Aziz|date=October 2006|title=The Fluorochemical Dilemma: What the PFOS/PFOA fuss is all about|format=PDF|journal=Cleaning &amp; Restoration|url=https://www.restorationindustry.org/buyersguide/FlurochemicalsOct06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stated that no water from this well entered the public water supply and that a nearby well and pumping station had been closed since the fire as a precaution. The chemical is a known health risk and the UK government had been about to ban its use.&lt;ref name="Questions still unanswered in Buncefield probe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Fluorochemical Dilemma" /&gt;

However just before the announcement, the [[Drinking Water Inspectorate]] announced that it was increasing the safe level of the chemical in drinking water.&lt;ref name="Report 6 May" /&gt; Hemel Hempstead MP, Mike Penning accused the government of changing the rules to suit the situation in which PFOS levels in drinking water in the area may rise in the future.&lt;ref name="Report 6 May"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hemeltoday.co.uk/CustomPages/CustomPage.aspx?pageID=58601|title=Hemeltoday reports on the Buncefield Investigation reports of May 06|date=May 2006|publisher=Hemelhempstead Today|accessdate=18 October 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the fuel burned out{{snd}}rather than spilling into the soil, so the impact on surrounding land and the water table was limited.&lt;ref name="Questions still unanswered in Buncefield probe" /&gt;

== Inquiry ==
[[File:Hampstead Heath airborne toxic event.jpg|thumb|Smoke from the fire over [[Hampstead Heath]], London]]
A government inquiry held jointly by the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) and the [[Environment Agency]] was started, but calls for a full public inquiry were declined.&lt;ref name="Five firms charged over oil blast " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buncefield Victims Criticise Cover Up"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=161759|title=Buncefield Victims Criticise Cover Up|date=12 January 2006|publisher=PR Newswire Europe Ltd.|accessdate=18 October 2009|location=WATFORD, England.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board included [[Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree]]; [[Dougal Drysdale|Prof Dougal Drysdale]], an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert.&lt;ref name="Buncefield tank 'was overflowing' " /&gt; Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board.&lt;ref name="Delayed Buncefield findings due "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/beds/bucks/herts/4734838.stm|title=Delayed Buncefield findings due |date=21 February 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim was to identify the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, so as not to prejudice further legal proceedings.&lt;ref name="Buncefield Victims Criticise Cover Up" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Delayed Buncefield findings due " /&gt;

An initial progress report by the Major Incident Investigation Board on 21 February 2006 did not go into the causes of the explosion, but summed up the event and the immediate reaction from the emergency services.&lt;ref name="Questions still unanswered in Buncefield probe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edie.net/news/news_story.asp?id=11110&amp;channel=0|title=Questions still unanswered in Buncefield probe|last=Bond |first=Sam|date=22 February 2006|publisher=Edie Daily|accessdate=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Delayed Buncefield findings due " /&gt; A second progress report, published on 11&amp;nbsp;April 2006, looked at the environmental impact.&lt;ref name="Five firms charged over oil blast " /&gt;

A further announcement was made on 9 May 2006 about the sequence of events which caused the explosion. Starting at 19:00 on the evening of 10 December 2005, Tank 912, towards the north west of the main depot, was filled with unleaded petrol{{snd}}from the [[Coryton Refinery]] located in Essex, England.&lt;ref name="How Buncefield fire unfolded"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4525504.stm|title=How Buncefield fire unfolded|date=13 July 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Report 6 May" /&gt; At midnight the terminal closed, and a check was made of the contents of tanks, which found everything normal. Normally the gauges monitor the level of the fuel in the tank as it fills from the particular pipeline. From about 03:00 the level gauge for Tank 912 began to indicate an unchanging level reading, despite it being filled at {{convert|550|m3|ft3|0}} per hour.&lt;ref name="Report 6 May" /&gt;

Calculations show that the tank would have begun to overflow at about 05:20.&lt;ref name="Buncefield tank 'was overflowing' " /&gt;&lt;ref name="How Buncefield fire unfolded" /&gt; There is evidence suggesting that a high-level switch, which should have detected that the tank was full and shut off the supply, failed to operate.&lt;ref name="Buncefield tank 'was overflowing' " /&gt;&lt;ref name="How Buncefield fire unfolded" /&gt; The switch failure should have triggered an alarm, but it too appears to have failed.&lt;ref name="Buncefield tank 'was overflowing' " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Report 6 May" /&gt; Forty-one minutes later, an estimated 300&amp;nbsp;tonnes of petrol would have spilled down the side of the tank through the roof vents onto the ground inside a [[bunding|bund]] wall{{snd}}a semi-enclosed compound surrounding several tanks.&lt;ref name="Buncefield tank 'was overflowing' " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Total liable for Buncefield blast " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Report 6 May" /&gt;

An overflow such as this results in the rapid formation of a rich fuel and air vapour. CCTV footage showed such a vapour flowing out the bund wall from around 05:38. By 05:50 the vapour started flowing off the site, near the junction of Cherry Tree and Buncefield Lane.&lt;ref name="How Buncefield fire unfolded" /&gt; Around 05:50 the rate at which fuel was being pumped into the tank increased dramatically. Initially the fuel was pumped in at {{convert|550|m3|ft3|0}} per hour, but it increased to about {{convert|890|m3|ft3|0}} per hour.&lt;ref name="How Buncefield fire unfolded" /&gt; By 06:01, when the first explosion occurred, the cloud which was initially about {{convert|1|m|ft|0}} deep, thickened to {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} and had spread beyond the boundaries of the site.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="How Buncefield fire unfolded" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fire at Hertfordshire oil depot is contained" /&gt;

The extent of the damage meant it was not possible to determine the exact source of ignition, but possibilities include an emergency generator and the depot's fire pump system.&lt;ref name="Massive blaze rages at fuel depot "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4517962.stm|title=Massive blaze rages at fuel depot |date=12 December 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Report 6 May" /&gt; The investigators did not believe that it was caused either by the driver of a fuel tanker, as had been speculated, or by anyone using a mobile phone. It was felt unlikely that the explosion had a widespread effect on air quality at ground level.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buncefield parallels drawn abroad" /&gt;

== Legal action ==

=== Civil liability ===
{{update|section|date=January 2011}}
[[File:Buncefield.jpg|thumb|The Buncefield depot is behind the Northgate building (at the right of this photo). The building lost the glass from all of its windows.]]
A total of 2,700 claims were filed by residents, businesses and insurers.&lt;ref name="Buncefield victims in court move"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/beds/bucks/herts/4816058.stm|title=Buncefield victims in court move|date=17 March 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of 146 claimants were hoping to bring a class action against Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd. On 17 March 2006 a High Court official, Senior Master Turner, adjourned a hearing on whether to permit the class action until October 2006.&lt;ref name="Buncefield victims in court move" /&gt;{{Update inline|date=December 2013}} Claimants including insurance companies, small businesses and about 280&amp;nbsp;families whose properties were damaged or destroyed were claiming up to £1&amp;nbsp;billion in damages.&lt;ref name="Total negligent over blast at Buncefield" /&gt;

Several court cases resulted from the explosion, although the main trial to determine who was liable for the damage commenced at the High Court in October 2008.&lt;ref name="Trial starts for Buncefield compensation claims"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/3717760.Trial_starts_for_Buncefield_compensation_claims/|title=Trial starts for Buncefield compensation claims|date=1 October 2008|publisher=Watford Observer|accessdate=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=December 2013}} The BBC quoted Cheetah Couriers{{snd}}which suffered a 20% drop in turnover because of the explosions, resulting in losses of around £300,000 to £400,000. The company was located in offices on an industrial estate {{convert|400|m|ft|}} from the depot.&lt;ref name="Buncefield victims in court move" /&gt;

An initial trial concluded on 23 May 2008 when Mr Justice David Steel issued a summary judgment after hearing that both Total and Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL) had agreed that negligence was the cause.&lt;ref name="Trial starts for Buncefield compensation claims" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Total negligent over blast at Buncefield"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article3993400.ece|title=Total negligent over blast at Buncefield|author1=Alex Spence |author2=Michael Herman|date=23 May 2008 |publisher=Times Online|accessdate=18 October 2009 | location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the main trial, Total UK claimed that the duty supervisor at the time was responsible for the explosion, but refused to admit either civil or criminal liability for the incident.&lt;ref name="Total liable for Buncefield blast " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Total negligent over blast at Buncefield" /&gt; Total UK argued that it should not be liable for damages because it could not reasonably have foreseen that it would cause the destruction it did.&lt;ref name="Total liable for Buncefield blast "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/beds/bucks/herts/7954814.stm|title=Total liable for Buncefield blast |date=20 March 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Total negligent over blast at Buncefield" /&gt; On 20 March 2009 the High Court found Total liable for the blast, saying that it was satisfied that Total had control of tank filling operations at the Buncefield depot.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt; The judgement left the company facing damage claims of around £700&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Trial starts for Buncefield compensation claims" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hemeltoday.co.uk/todays/Total-found-liable-for-Buncefield.5093636.jp|title=Total found liable for Buncefield explosion|date=20 March 2009|publisher=Hemel Hempstead Gazette|accessdate=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal liability ===
The site is covered by the COMAH regulations. The Control of Major Accidents and Hazards Regulations are jointly enforced by the "competent authority" which is formed of the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive. They carried out an investigation during and following the fire.

In April 2010 the five companies accused of causing the explosion faced a criminal prosecution brought by the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency. Two defendants, Total UK and British Pipeline Agency Limited, had already pleaded guilty to offences under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The remaining three, Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd, TAV Engineering Ltd, and Motherwell Control Systems were found guilty in June 2010. TAV Engineering Ltd and Motherwell Control Systems were found guilty of failing to protect their employees. Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd was found guilty of failing to prevent major accidents and limit their effects and then pleaded guilty to causing pollution to enter controlled waters underlying the vicinity around the site, contrary to the [[Water Resources Act 1991|Water Resources Act]].&lt;ref name="Trial starts for Buncefield compensation claims" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Five firms charged over oil blast "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/beds/bucks/herts/8040109.stm|title=Five firms charged over oil blast |date=8 May 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/nov/13/total-admits-charges-buncefield|title=Oil company Total admits Buncefield fire failings

== The terminal ==
{{Main|Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal}}
The [[Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal]] (HOSL{{snd}}Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd), generally known as the Buncefield complex, was the fifth largest oil-products storage depot in the UK, with a capacity of about {{convert|60000000|impgal|ML}} of fuel, although it was not always full.&lt;ref name="Massive blaze rages at fuel depot " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Total liable for Buncefield blast " /&gt; This was about 8% of UK oil storage capacity.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fire Rages After Blasts At Oil Depot" /&gt;

The HOSL is a major hub on the [[UK oil pipeline network|UK's oil pipeline network]] (UKOP) with pipelines to [[Humberside]] and [[Stanlow Refinery]] and is an important fuel source to the British aviation industry, providing aircraft fuel for local airports including [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]], [[Heathrow]] and [[London Luton Airport|Luton]] airports.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt; About half of the complex is dedicated to the storage of aviation fuel. The remainder of the complex stores oil, kerosene, petrol and diesel fuel for petrol stations across much of the South-East of England.&lt;ref name="Can sound really travel 200 miles?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Total liable for Buncefield blast " /&gt; The terminal is owned by TOTAL UK Limited (60%) and Texaco 40%.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fire Rages After Blasts At Oil Depot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trial starts for Buncefield compensation claims" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Total"/&gt;

The seat of the fire, and the worst damaged section, was "HOSL West", used by Total and Texaco to store a variety of fuels, and the neighbouring [[British Pipeline Agency]] area.&lt;ref name="Buncefield: One Year Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trial starts for Buncefield compensation claims" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Total" /&gt;

== Causes ==
[[File:Clear skys apart from Hempstead.jpg|thumb|The Hemel Hempstead smoke plume on Monday, 12 December 2005.]]
The final report of the [[Major Incident Investigation Board]] (MIIB) was written in 2008 and released in February 2011.&lt;ref name="ThisOutdatedArticleNeedsThisReport"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/buncefield/buncefield-report.pdf Official accident report from MIIB]&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation found that Tank 912 at the Buncefield oil storage depot was being filled with petrol. The tank had a level gauge that employees used to monitor the level manually, and an independent high-level switch which would shut off inflow if the level got above a certain setpoint. On Tank 912, the manual gauge was stuck and the independent shut-off switch was inoperative, meaning that the tank was being "filled blind" with petrol (i.e., being filled without a clear indication of the level). Eventually Tank 912 filled up completely, the petrol overflowed through vents at the top, and formed a vapour cloud near ground level, which ignited and exploded. The fires from the explosion then lasted for five days.&lt;ref name="ThisOutdatedArticleNeedsThisReport"/&gt;

The investigation found that the level gauge had stuck at random times after a tank service in August 2005, but it did not concern maintenance contractors or site management. The independent shut-off switch was not fitted with a critical padlock to allow its check lever to work. Secondary containment (meant to trap the petrol in a retaining wall around the tank) failed and allowed petrol to flow out. Tertiary containment (drains and catchment areas to prevent release of spilled chemicals to the environment) also failed, and fuel and firefighting foam entered groundwater supplies. The investigation found secondary and tertiary containment to be inadequately designed and poorly maintained.&lt;ref name="ThisOutdatedArticleNeedsThisReport"/&gt;

Wider management failings were found by the investigation to have contributed to the explosion: management safety checks at the site were found to be deficient and not properly followed. Site staff did not have control over the flow rates and timing of two of the three inlet sources, meaning that they did not have enough information to properly manage the storage of incoming fuel. Further, overall throughput had increased, reducing wait times further and shifting the emphasis to process operations instead of process safety.&lt;ref name="ThisOutdatedArticleNeedsThisReport"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{update-section|date=January 2018}}
Soon after the incident the Health Protection Agency was stripped of its remit to provide air quality data and it was passed on to the Environment Agency which forms part of the Major Accident Investigation Board.

=== Remembrance ===
An anniversary service was held in Holy Trinity Church [[Leverstock Green]] on Sunday, 10 December 2006, at which the Bishop of St Albans spoke, calling again for a full public inquiry, for assurances that the local hospital would maintain its accident and emergency department, and for the community to continue to build on good relationships formed because of the blast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Reconstruction ===
To rebuild the damaged parts of the site, the relevant approval from Dacorum Borough Council would be needed. The BP section of the site is a good way from the explosion and survived with very little damage, but it was inoperative as of 2009.&lt;ref name="BIIM FAQ1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buncefieldinvestigation.gov.uk/faqs.htm#rebuilt|title=Buncefield investigation{{snd}}Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=BIIM|accessdate=11 December 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080404014507/http://www.buncefieldinvestigation.gov.uk/faqs.htm#rebuilt |archivedate = 4 April 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; BP is exploring plans for the future use of this part of the site, and has indicated a number of priorities, including the reopening of the fuel pipelines to Heathrow. It is considering using its section to store aviation fuel and as a distribution centre for motor fuel, but at a much-reduced level.&lt;ref name="BIIM FAQ1" /&gt; In late 2009, Total UK submitted plans for the reconstruction of the oil depot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forecourttrader.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/3263/Plans_for_Buncefield.html|title=Plans for Buncefield|date=2 November 2009|publisher=forecourttrader.co.uk|accessdate=15 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstruction of the site has been taking place since March 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bpa.co.uk/bpa-kicks-off-the-buncefield-rebuild-project/|title=BPA kicks off the Buncefield Rebuild Project.|date=2013-03-20|work=Oil and gas pipeline consultant|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{2008 Summer Olympics}}

A number of '''concerns and controversies''' surfaced before, during, and after the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], and which received major media coverage. Leading up to the Olympics, there were concerns about human rights in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3545274,00.html|title=Protestors Rally in Europe on Eve of China Olympics|date=7 August 2008  |publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=9 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/theeditorialpage/story.html?id=c06e4f24-ea77-467c-960e-abc94721e094 |title=China's un-Olympic human rights record |work=Calgary Herald |date=9 August 2008 |accessdate=9 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625133402/http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/theeditorialpage/story.html?id=c06e4f24-ea77-467c-960e-abc94721e094 |archivedate=25 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5iM4HoqRxdb5TWSCC16uQuHn2_q7g|title=Canadian protests over China's human-rights record continue prior to Games|date=8 August 2008  |work=Haaretz|accessdate=9 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that many high-profile individuals, such as politicians and celebrities, announced intentions to boycott the games to protest China's role in the [[War in Darfur|Darfur conflict]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7503428.stm? |title=China 'is fuelling war in Darfur' |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=12 July 2008 | date=13 July 2008 | first=Hilary | last=Andersson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Myanmar]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/08/china.tibet Olympic protests held around the world], ''The Guardian'', 8 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; its stance towards [[Tibet]],&lt;ref name="ma ying-jeou"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/video/2008/03/24/2197256.htm |title=Taiwan threatens Olympics boycott|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date= 24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other aspects of its human rights record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1009630.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815044111/https://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1009630.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 August 2008|first=Saul|last=Newman|title=Why Grandpa boycotted the Olympics|work=Haaretz|accessdate=9 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Jacobson [http://www.adl.org/ADL_Opinions/International_Affairs/20080801-Op-ed+JW.htm Don't Curtail a Changing China's Progress: The Case Against Sanctions] Anti-Defamation League, 1 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During the games in Beijing, the city was also under a high alert because of security concerns following civil unrest in Tibet and terrorist attacks by [[Xinjiang]] separatists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7366627.stm | title = Beijing warned of 'terror threat' | date = 25 April 2008  |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080425.wolyminterpol0425/BNStory/International/?page=rss&amp;id=RTGAM.20080425.wolyminterpol0425 |title=Interpol says Olympic terror attack 'real possibility |work=The Globe and Mail |date=25 April 2008 |location=Toronto |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509082147/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080425.wolyminterpol0425/BNStory/International/?page=rss&amp;id=RTGAM.20080425.wolyminterpol0425 |archivedate=9 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interpol"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/25042008/3/interpol-chief-warns-olympic-terror-threat.html |title=Interpol chief warns of Olympic terror threat |agency=Agence France-Presse| publisher=Yahoo!

Other controversies surrounding the 2008 Summer Olympics included ticketing problems, displacement of Beijing residents due to construction and demolitions, and alleged persecution of individuals applying to protest.

In spite of the various controversies, [[International Olympic Committee]] president [[Jacques Rogge]] said at the closing ceremony that they were "truly exceptional Games".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26375478/ |title=China closes its 'truly exceptional games' |publisher=MSNBC |agency=Associated Press|date=24 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security ===
In April, non-Chinese in Beijing reported more regular checks of their identification and work permits, while travel agents in Hong Kong reported that multiple-entry business [[visa (document)|visas]] for the mainland, commonly used by non-Chinese businessmen who lack work visas, were no longer being issued, apparently in an attempt to prevent the entry of non-Chinese activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/28/AR2008042802238.html?hpid=artslot |title=For Chinese, a Shift in Mood, From Hospitable to Hostile|author=Edward Cody|work=The Washington Post |date= 29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased security was put into place for the Olympics, and security personnel were trained to counter different terrorist attack scenarios. Anti-aircraft missiles were also installed over the Olympic stations in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://olympics.scmp.com/Article.aspx?id=746&amp;section=latestnews | title = Beijing deploys anti-aircraft missiles | last = Zhou | first = Martin | date = 23 June 2008 | work = South China Morning Post | location = Hong Kong | accessdate = 29 July 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080803210648/http://olympics.scmp.com/Article.aspx?id=746&amp;section=latestnews | archive-date = 3 August 2008 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1029449/Gold-medal-security-China-installs-anti-aircraft-missile-launchers-Olympic-sites.html | title = Gold medal for security: China installs anti-aircraft missile launchers at all Olympic sites |work=Daily Mail | date = 25 June 2008 | accessdate = 9 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' reported that China had mobilised 110,000 police and other security forces in Beijing itself, plus 1.4&amp;nbsp;million security volunteers and 300,000 surveillance volunteers. The security bill for Beijing alone was estimated in excess of [[Pound sterling|£]]3&amp;nbsp;billion. Outside the capital, cities hosting Olympic events were patrolled by 34,000 troops, [[surface-to-air missile]]s guarded key sites, and 74 military aircraft, 48 helicopters, and 33 naval vessels were placed on high alert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/rosemary_righter/article4460645.ece | title = Has China got a terrorist problem? | author=Rosemary Righter |work=The Times |date=5 August 2008  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hong Kong's ''[[South China Morning Post]] (SCMP)'' reported that bar owners in the [[Sanlitun]] district of Beijing were ordered by police officials not to serve "black people or Mongolians" as well as of two staff members that were ethnic Tibetan&lt;ref name=africans&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/29/AR2008072902389_2.html?hpid=moreheadlines |title=Chinese Officials Give Club District A Brusque Cleanup |author=Jill Drew |work=The Washington Post|date= 30 July 2008|page= A01}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080718.wchina19/BNStory/International/home | title = Africans in Beijing harassed as Olympics approach | date = 18 July 2008 | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] | publisher=[[CTVglobemedia]] | accessdate = 9 August 2008 | first = Geoffrey | last = York | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/fears-of-a-nofun-olympics-in-beijing-20080718-3hkb.html |title=Fears of a 'no-fun' Olympics in Beijing |date=19 July 2008 |work=The Age |accessdate=9 August 2008 |first=Mary-Anne |last=Toy |location=Melbourne, Australia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316015953/http://www.theage.com.au/world/fears-of-a-nofun-olympics-in-beijing-20080718-3hkb.html |archivedate=16 March 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]'''s Liam Fitzpatrick stated that the report by the ''SCMP'' was "unconfirmed", and its information was from "anonymous" sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time-blog.com/china_blog/2008/07/one_world_one_dream_one_seriou.html|title=One World, One Dream, One Serious Allegation|work=Time|date= 18 July 2008|accessdate=10 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, ''The Washington Post'' interviewed several black bar patrons in Sanlitun, all of whom said they had not been denied service.&lt;ref name=africans/&gt; China's official news agency [[Xinhua]] stated on 21 July the alleged "bar policy" was groundless and the city's public security departments, including Sanlitun police, never demanded any bar not serve customers from any region or country ahead of the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/22/asia/AS-OLY-China-Bar-Ban-Denial.php|title=China denies report of ban on Africans, Mongolians in bars for Olympics|work=International Herald Tribune|date= 22 July 2008|accessdate=10 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Professionalism and etiquette ====
The Beijing government issued new mandates requiring police officers in the city to act more professionally, warning that violators would be reprimanded. By doing this, Beijing hoped to clean up its image in time for the games. The government circulated pamphlets urging officers to desist from using foul language, being arrogant, and hanging up on people who call to report crimes.&lt;ref name="Police conduct"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[GamesBids]] |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1178899588 |date=11 May 2007 |title=New Guidelines For Beijing Police Ahead of 2008 Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A drive was also launched to improve [[Engrish|incorrect English translations]] common on Chinese signage and labelling in readiness for the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6052800.stm |title=Beijing stamps out poor English| publisher=BBC News |date= 15 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs were placed around Beijing, instructing locals not to ask any non-Chinese personal questions for fear of causing discomfort to tourists and athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/wgal/news/newsid=154888.html |title=Etiquette guide: What not to ask Olympic visitors |publisher=NBCOlympics.com |date= 23 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opening ceremony ===
{{Main article|2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony}}

====Participant exclusion====
Hong Kong [[Bishop (Catholicism)|Bishop]] [[John Tong Hon]] said of his acceptance to participate in the opening ceremony that “while the leaders of the six largest religions in Hong Kong were invited to Beijing, only in the case of the Catholic Church was an invitation not sent to the highest authority. I am embarrassed because our government ignored [[Joseph Zen Ze-kiun|Cardinal Zen]] and invited me instead.” He expressed his desire that China's government would someday give “the same importance to greater religious and social freedom that it had in cleaning up Beijing's pollution in anticipation of the games,” nonetheless noting that “the Olympic Games [still showed] the progress of China”.&lt;ref name="cna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=13474|title=Chinese bishop explains reasons for participating in Olympic opening ceremonies|agency=Catholic News Agency|accessdate=10 August 2008|date=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="standard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=2176|title=China snubs Zen, invites deputy|work=The Standard|accessdate=10 August 2008|date=8 August 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522085905/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=2176|archive-date=22 May 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0804042.htm|title=Hong Kong bishop says he has mixed feelings about attending Olympics|publisher=Catholic News Service|accessdate=11 August 2008|date=7 August 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813011739/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0804042.htm|archive-date=13 August 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucaninv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucanews.com/2008/06/13/bishops-from-hong-kong-macau-invited-to-beijing-olympics-opening/|title=Bishops From Hong Kong, Macau Invited To Beijing Olympics' Opening|date=13 June 2008|work=Union of Catholic Asian News|accessdate=11 August 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615163424/http://www.ucanews.com/2008/06/13/bishops-from-hong-kong-macau-invited-to-beijing-olympics-opening/|archive-date=15 June 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Singing====
[[Ode to the Motherland]], sometimes called "the second national anthem" of the PRC, was lipsynched by Lin Miaoke. The song actually broadcast was a recording of another girl, Yang Peiyi. Chen Qigang, the ceremony's chief musical director, claimed that this was because a senior [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] member had commented that Lin's singing was not good enough, but preferred Lin's appearance to that of Yang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/sports/olympics/13beijing.html?ex=1376280000&amp;en=925892efa500e4d3&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink | work=The New York Times | title=In Grand Olympic Show, Some Sleight of Voice | first=Jim | last=Yardley | date=13 August 2008 | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/olympics/2545387/Beijing-Olympics-Faking-scandal-over-girl-who-sang-in-opening-ceremony.html| title=Beijing Olympics Faking scandal over girl who sang in opening ceremony|work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 August 2008 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Spencer | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7556058.stm| title=China Olympic ceremony star mimed| publisher=BBC|date=12 August 2008 | first=Michael | last=Bristow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sun Weide, the spokesman for the Beijing organising committee, said however that the decision to use both girls was made by the artistic director after consulting with broadcasters, who had recommended the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/13/asia/AS-OLY-China-Lip-Synched-Song.php |title=Chinese defend Olympic ceremony lip-synch |agency=Associated Press |work=International Herald Tribune |date=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advertisement in Spain ===
Prior to the start of the Games, the Spain Men's and Women's Basketball teams featured in ads that appeared in the Spanish daily sports newspaper ''[[Diario Marca]]''.&lt;ref name="guardian-spain"&gt;{{cite news | first=Sid | last=Lowe | title=Olympics: Spain's eye-catching faux pas |date=11 August 2008  | url =https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/olympicsbasketball.olympics20081 |work=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The athletes, dressed in uniform and assembled at a center court bearing a dragon logo, posed with their hands pulling back the skin on their eyes. ''[[The Guardian]]'' said: "No one involved in the advert appears to have considered it inappropriate nor contemplated the manner in which it could be interpreted in China and elsewhere."&lt;ref name="guardian-spain" /&gt; A spokesman for the Organization of Chinese Americans said that the photo was "clearly racist, and not even in a jovial way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Schoetz | title=Spain's 'Slant-Eye' Team Photo Stirs Ire |date=12 August 2008  | url =http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=5563668&amp;page=1 | publisher=American Broadcasting Company }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FIFA v football clubs dispute ===
In July 2008, the football clubs representing players taking part in the games, [[FC Schalke 04]], [[SV Werder Bremen]] and [[FC Barcelona]], made an appeal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] to prevent their star players, namely [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil's]] [[Rafinha (footballer, born 1985)|Rafinha]] and [[Diego Ribas da Cunha|Diego]] and [[Argentina national under-23 football team|Argentina's]] [[Lionel Messi]] respectively, from playing at the Olympics.&lt;ref name="guardian-football"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/06/olympics2008.olympicsfootball&lt;/ref&gt;

FIFA's rule states that it was mandatory to release all players aged 23 or under for the Olympics which was overturned on July 30, 2008, stating that "The Olympic Football Tournament Beijing 2008 is not included in the Co-ordinated Match Calendar and there is no specific decision of the FIFA Executive Committee establishing the obligation for the clubs to release players under 23 for this tournament."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/2510034/Lionel-Messi-out-of-Olympics-after-Barcelona-win-court-appeal-against-Fifa.html|title=Lionel Messi out of Olympics after Barcelona win court appeal against Fifa|date=6 August 2008|website=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant clubs were entitled to recall their players from the games if they wished.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

Despite the ruling, FIFA appealed to the club, Rafinha and Diego was released for the games under the provision that their salaries was paid for by the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]].&lt;ref name="thestar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/story.aspx/?file=%2f2008%2f8%2f8%2folympics%2f22034795&amp;sec=Olympics|title=Messi allowed to play for Argentina in the Olympics|date=8 August 2008|website=thestar.com.my|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite resistance from his employer,&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Messi was eventually released for the games.&lt;ref name="thestar"/&gt;

=== State training and expectations of Chinese athletes ===
As the host country, China's very high expectations put immense pressure upon athletes and coaches alike. [[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]], the defending Olympic champion for the 110 meter hurdles, had pulled out of the heats with an injury.&lt;ref name="liu pressure"/&gt; His victory in Athens four years ago was China's first gold medal in track and field, regarded by some as dispelling the widespread view that Chinese physiology was unsuitable for such a discipline.

Parents and children endure considerable personal sacrifices – young children often leave their families to endure long and tough training regimens in the state academies, where 250,000 children are enrolled.&lt;ref name=sacrifice&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/05/sports/gymnast.php |title=Chinese gymnast endured childhood sacrifice |work=International Herald Tribune|author=David Barboza |date=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/20/world/asia/20olympics.html |title=In Quest for Gold and Glory at Olympics, China Pressures Injured Athletes |work=The New York Times |author=Howard W. French| date=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also say that the sports schools focus on training at the expense of general education, leaving athletes unprepared to leave the sports system that has raised them. [[Yang Wenjun]], a C-2 Canoeing champion at the Athens Olympics, told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that he was ill-equipped to go to college or start a business. He recounted officials' threats to withhold his retirement income if he quit before the Beijing Games, adding that it was "not possible to survive without those benefits". While Yang and his family have received numerous rewards for his achievement (including white collar jobs, stipends, performance bonuses, endorsements, and an apartment), he has not seen his parents in three years.&lt;ref name=medalfactory&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/21/sports/olympics/21athlete.html |title= In China's Medal Factory, Winners Cannot Quit
|author=Juliet Macur |work=The New York Times |date=21 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the opposite side, for those athletes who do win Gold medals, the State offers a significant performance bonus. [[Cheng Fei]], for example, could look forward to more than $150,000 in cash and bonuses for every Olympic Gold Medal she wins.&lt;ref name=sacrifice/&gt; Yang said his wins at the [[2002 Asian Games]] netted him about [US]$28,600 in bonuses –more than the money his parents can earn in ten years.&lt;ref name=medalfactory/&gt;

=== Doping ===
{{Main article|Doping at the Olympic Games#2008 Beijing}}

Out of 4,500 samples that were collected from participating athletes at the games, six athletes with positive specimens were ousted from the competition. Although the rate of positive findings was lower than at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], doping experts expressed concern due to advances in doping technology.&lt;ref name="dwde"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3530852,00.html |publisher=Deutsche Welle |title=Beijing Faces Big Challenge in Keeping Olympics Drug-Free|date=3 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel082308"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/0,1518,573934,00.html |author=kna/reuters|title=Ukrainischer Gewichtheber Razoronov positiv getestet |journal=Der Spiegel|date=23 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGrath" /&gt; In July 2008, a [[BBC]] investigation reported that samples positive for [[erythropoietin]] were labelled as negative by [[World Anti-Doping Agency|WADA]]-approved laboratories.&lt;ref name="McGrath"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7516484.stm |author=Matt McGrath |publisher=BBC |title=Concerns over Olympic drug test |date=21 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOC stated in October 2008 that it would begin retesting samples for [[Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator|CERA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/10/content_10173506.htm|title=IOC to retest Beijing doping samples|date=10 October 2008|agency=Xinhua News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the Olympics has had the most (49 of 50) [[List of stripped Olympic medals|Olympic medals stripped]] for doping violations. Russia is the leading country with 14 medals stripped off.

== Political issues leading up to the games ==

=== Migrant workers ===
The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) estimated that China had 150 million migrant workers out of a total national working population of 764 million people at the end of 2006. More than 40 million of these migrant workers were employed in construction, an industry in which some 90 percent of the workforce was composed of migrants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2008/china0308/china0308webwcover.pdf China “One Year of My Blood”] Exploitation of Migrant Construction Workers in Beijing REPORT March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[2008 Summer Olympics]] [[migrant workers]] routinely endured dangerous work environments and lacked any safety net, including medical and accident insurance. Problems of [[migrant workers]] included unpaid wages and high legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2008/china0308/ "One Year of My Blood" Exploitation of Migrant Construction Workers in Beijing] [[Human Rights Watch]] summary&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boycotts ===

The [[British Olympic Association]] (BOA) required that British participants signed an agreement before leaving for China, promising not to comment on any "politically sensitive issues."  However, a BOA spokesman stated that the BOA's intention was not to censor athletes, but to reaffirm the IOC charter, which prohibits demonstration of political, religious or racial propaganda in any Olympic venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/breakingnews/feedstory/0,,-7298200,00.html |work=The Guardian |title=Olympics – UK athletes barred from political comments |date=10 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2008 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214074359/http://sport.guardian.co.uk/breakingnews/feedstory/0%2C%2C-7298200%2C00.html |archivedate=14 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf |title=Olympic Charter |publisher=International Olympic Committee |date=16 October 2007 |accessdate=10 February 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727143137/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, attendance at the 2008 games was highly politicised, with as many as 80 political heads of state attending;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kosyrev|first=Dmitry |url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20080806/115849259.html|title=Beijing Olympics as a diplomatic convention|accessdate=9 August 2008|agency=RIA Novosti|date=6 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; several major political figures, however, considered boycotting the Games for political reasons.

=== Terrorist incident ===
{{See also|2008 Xinjiang attack}}
On 10 April 2008, China announced that it had foiled a plot against the games by [[East Turkestan independence movement|Uyghur separatists]] in [[Xinjiang]]. According to the Chinese security ministry, separatists planned suicide bomb attacks on Chinese cities and kidnappings in Beijing to disrupt the Olympic Games. Uyghur activists claim that the Chinese fabricated these terror plots to prevent people in the region from voicing their grievances with the Han Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7340181.stm | title = China 'foils Olympic terror plot'  | date =10 April 2008 | accessdate = 9 August 2008 | publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 April 2008, [[Interpol]] issued a warning that there was a real possibility that the Beijing Olympics would be targeted by terrorist groups.&lt;ref name="interpol" /&gt;

==== Boycott calls ====
Some [[International Tibet Independence Movement|pro-Tibetan independence]] groups, such as [[Students for a Free Tibet]], initiated a campaign against the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Protests, Smog Cloud Olympics a Year Out | agency=Associated Press | first = Stephan | last = Wade |date=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to protest for Tibetan independence, It also objected to the use of the [[Tibetan antelope]] (chiru) as the [[Fuwa]] Yingying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.studentsforafreetibet.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=15 | title = Free Tibet 2008! – One World, One Dream: Free Tibet 2008 | accessdate = 8 January 2007 | publisher = Students for a Free Tibet | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070101074244/http://www.studentsforafreetibet.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=15 | archive-date = 1 January 2007 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tibetan People's Movement has also demanded representation of [[Tibet]] with its own national flag. American film actor [[Richard Gere]], chairman of the [[International Campaign for Tibet]] called for a boycott to put pressure on China to make Tibet independent. There were also plans by Tibetans in exile to hold [[Tibetan Olympics 2008|their own version of the Olympics]] in May, at the headquarters of the exiled government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/storypage/storypage.aspx?id=f35048f8-e21b-4858-88ad-1956f57372c7&amp;ParentID=d0415f44-d6d6-47c6-b39f-9a84c8322530&amp;MatchID1=4664&amp;TeamID1=5&amp;TeamID2=2&amp;MatchType1=1&amp;SeriesID1=1173&amp;MatchID2=4673&amp;TeamID3=4&amp;TeamID4=8&amp;MatchType2=1&amp;SeriesID2=1177&amp;PrimaryID=4664&amp;Headline=Tibetan+Olympics+from+May+15-25 | title = Tibetan Olympics from 15&amp;nbsp;May-25 | date = 20 March 2008 | accessdate = 9 August 2008 |work=Hindustan Times |location=India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international journalist group [[Reporters Without Borders]] (RSF) advocated boycott to express concerns over violations of free speech and human rights in China. It hoped that international pressure could effect the release of [[prisoners of conscience]] and the upholding of [[Beijing 2008 Olympic bid|promises made to the IOC]] regarding improvements in human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=174 | title = Repression continues in China, one month before Olympic Games | accessdate = 9 August 2008 | publisher = [[Reporters Without Borders]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20020601081212/http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=174 | archive-date = 1 June 2002 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 50 Tibetan exiles in India began a global torch relay 25 March 2008 with a symbolic "Olympic" flame that ended in Tibet on 8 August 2008, the day of the Summer Games' opening ceremonies in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/25/tibet.protest.relay.ap/index.html | title = Tibetan exiles stage fake Olympic relay | publisher=CNN| date =25 March 2008 | accessdate = 9 August 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080612112230/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/25/tibet.protest.relay.ap/index.html| archivedate = 12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the torch was heavily guarded by local police and Chinese security agents wearing blue track suits, protesters attempting to stop the relay or take the torch were a significant problem along the route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120765486995597695 | title = Torch's Guards Have a Link to Tibet  | publisher=wsj.com | date = 9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disruption of the torch relay and foreign condemnation of China resulted in a backlash of [[Chinese nationalism|nationalism]] and anti-foreigner sentiment in China.&lt;ref name=timeburning&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1734821,00.html|title=Why China's Burning Mad|work=Time|date=24 April 2008|accessdate=26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; French goods and businesses were threatened with a reprisals for the assault on torch-bearers through Paris, France.

In late April, Chinese Internet censors, who had previously permitted posts critical of non-Chinese, began blocking words such as "Carrefour", in what was seen as an attempt to calm tensions before the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Carrefour Removed From Chinese Internet 30&amp;nbsp;April 2008  |publisher=China Tech News |url=http://www.chinatechnews.com/2008/04/30/6693-carrefour-removed-from-chinese-internet/}}

=== Web and media censorship ===
China pledged in its [[Beijing 2008 Olympic bid|Olympic bid]] that it would allow open media access during the games, but [[Human Rights Watch]] alleges that it had failed to do so.&lt;ref name=twoconcerns&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/sports/olympics/09beijing.html?ref=olympics |title=Two Concerns for Olympics – Air and Access |work=The New York Times |date= 9 July 2008 | first=Jim | last=Yardley | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some estimated 20,000 journalists had been assured unfettered Internet access by the IOC's [[Jacques Rogge]], Sun Weide (孙伟德) of the Beijing Organizing Committee announced in late July that China would allow only "convenient" access – still blocking sites which reference controversial content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/548f4410-5e3a-11dd-b354-000077b07658.html |title= China limits Olympics journalists’ web access|author=Mure Dickie |work=Financial Times  |date= 30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOC and broadcasters were uncertain as to whether the Beijing authorities would allow them to broadcast live from locations such as [[Tiananmen Square]], fearing protests. In 2001, Beijing announced there would be complete freedom for the media to report in China. After lengthy discussions, broadcasters were permitted to broadcast between the hours of 6–10&amp;nbsp;am and 9–11&amp;nbsp;pm with prior permission; however, live interviews were banned at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/latest-news/global-anger-at-internet-blockade/2008/07/31/1217097434368.html?page=2 |title=Global anger at internet blockade|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many broadcasters were unhappy with this decision as it would "set a bad precedent in regards to [[press freedom]]", and were pushing the authorities further on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jZQlFFurD2ZlbELDE_X1jGKo12vwD91T1AS00 |title=Broadcast access to Tiananmen remains at issue |agency=Associated Press |date=13 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802215837/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jZQlFFurD2ZlbELDE_X1jGKo12vwD91T1AS00 |archivedate=2 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July, US senator [[Sam Brownback]] alleged that foreign-owned hotels in China were ordered by the government to install equipment to monitor internet use by guests. Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said that the security arrangements did not exceed "what is normal internationally".&lt;ref name=spyon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gAkDaSkHWHboscdhQZwdRBt6hZnw |agency=Agence France-Presse |publisher=Google |title=China plans to spy on Olympic hotel guests: US senator |date=29 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109181016/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gAkDaSkHWHboscdhQZwdRBt6hZnw |archivedate=9 January 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brownback&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-olyspy30-2008jul30,0,5823677.story |title=Sen.

The IOC also investigated complaints from the international media that the Internet at the Main Press Centre was slow and some websites remain blocked, which may disrupt reporting. This was seen when [[Amnesty International]] criticised the Chinese government for not delivering on its [[Beijing 2008 Olympic bid|Olympic promises]] of human rights; however journalists could not access the website. Additionally, websites critical of the government, or relating to Tibet and [[Falun Gong]] remain blocked at the centre. Kevan Gosper from the IOC clarified that the 'open Internet' only refers to reporting directly on the games, and not other issues relating to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2008/07/29/internet_sites_still_blocked_for_olympic_reporters/ |title=Internet sites still blocked for Olympic reporters |work=Stephen Wade, Associated Press |date=29 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901095221/http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2008/07/29/internet_sites_still_blocked_for_olympic_reporters/ |archivedate=1 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to international pressure, a number of websites, notably [[BBC]], [[Amnesty International]], [[Reporters Without Borders]], and [[Apple Daily]] were unblocked.&lt;ref name="scmplist"&gt;{{cite news| &lt;!--Dead link: url=http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0/?vgnextoid=86217c46b2f7b110VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&amp;ss=China&amp;s=News |--&gt; work= South China Morning Post|title= Beijing yields in part to pressure over internet use|accessdate=1 August 2008}}(subscription only)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[2008 Weng'an riot|Weng'an riot]], which was incited by the rape and murder of a teenage girl, [[photographs]] as well as comments on the [[Guizhou]] protest in [[chatrooms]] and [[Internet forum|forums]] were quickly [[File deletion|deleted]] by the [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|mainland Internet censors]].  The government launched a campaign to defuse protest ahead of the Olympics to continue carrying out social harmony and stability.

== Environmental and health issues ==

The [[United States Olympic Committee]] imported food for American athletes, citing concerns regarding the safety of food products produced in China. In particular, athletes were concerned that eating meat that was raised in China could contain enough steroids to cause the athletes to test positive for steroid use.&lt;ref name="Steroid use"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/09/sports/othersports/09olympics.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=olympic%20food%20beijing%20committee&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin|title=Wary U.S. Olympians Will Bring Food to China|author=Ben Shpigel |work=The New York Times |date=9 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Canadian athletes received permission to do the same.

The commission found that outdoor endurance events—defined as those that include at least an hour of continuous, high-intensity physical effort—may pose some risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120577799162242425|title=Olympic Worry in the Air|date=18 March 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2008 |work=The Wall Street Journal | first1=Sky | last1=Canaves | first2=Christopher | last2=Rhoads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of such efforts, several countries indicated that their athletes would arrive at the games as late as possible to limit exposure to pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6950883.stm|title=WHO fears over Beijing pollution|date=17 August 2007|accessdate=17 August 2007 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many teams set up offshore training camps in neighbouring countries to avoid the pollution.&lt;ref name=gripe/&gt; The pollution prompted several athletes to change events or opt out: for example, [[Ethiopia]]n long-distance runner [[Haile Gebrselassie]] withdrew from the [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon|marathon]] and ran the [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's 10,000 metres|10,000 meters]] instead, to reduce the risk of harm to himself because of his [[asthma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics/athletics/7287578.stm| title=Gebrselassie opts out of marathon| publisher=[[BBC Sport]]| date=10 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Belgian tennis player [[Justine Henin]] announced nearly a year before the games that she would not compete for the same reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=3095205 | title=Henin trying to manage asthma, might skip Olympics |publisher=ESPN  | date=4 August 2008 | accessdate=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, stricter emergency pollution controls were introduced, including suspending production at more factories and coal-fired power plants, lowering the number of cars on the road and expanding driving restrictions to nearby [[Tianjin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/01/sports/olympics/01china.html?emc=tnt&amp;tntemail1=y | title=China Announces More Pollution Controls |work=The New York Times |date=1 August 2008 | first=Jim | last=Yardley | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early July, Beijing ordered 40 factories in [[Tianjin]] and 300 factories in [[Tangshan]] to begin suspending operations in an effort to reduce air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7491456.stm |title=China to close plants over Games| publisher=BBC| date= 5 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 July, a major temporary air pollution control plan began: additional factories were shut down; there were license plate restrictions which allowed Beijing motorists to drive on alternate days only, depending on whether the last number on their license plate was odd or even, to reduce daily traffic by two million vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;A similar approach was used for other events such as the [[2015 China Victory Day Parade]] and the [[2016 G20 Hangzhou summit]].&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the program, by 28 July the ''[[China Daily]]'' reported that Beijing's skies remained alarmingly polluted and that authorities were considering emergency measures during the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/sports/olympics/29china.html|title=Beijing Weighs Added Pollution Plans for Olympics|date=29 July 2008 |accessdate=29 July 2008 |work=The New York Times | first=Jim | last=Yardley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-07/28/content_6880332.htm|title=Beijing mulls emergency green plan for Games|date=28 July 2008 |accessdate=28 July 2008 |work=China Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div class="center"&gt;{{2008 Summer Olympics air quality}}&lt;/div&gt;

As the Games began, air quality in Beijing improved significantly against prior expectations. Air quality throughout the Games recorded [[Air Pollution Index#Mainland China|API]] scores under 100, the official target. Of the 16 days of the Games, ten days recorded 'Grade I' and six days recorded 'Grade II' air quality in Chinese standards.&lt;ref name=xinhua1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/19/content_9501386.htm|title=Official: air quality for Olympics Beijing's best in a decade|agency=Xinhua News Agency|date= 19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media concerns of air quality has also subsided as the Games progressed. However, a 28 July 2008 [[Greenpeace]] report stated that average concentration of [[atmospheric particulate matter]] in Beijing was still twice the levels the [[World Health Organization]] considers safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/node/14937 |title=Beijing Pollution Still Twice WHO Levels: Greenpeace |agency=Agence France-Presse |publisher=abs-cbn news |date=28 July 2008 |access-date=14 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623144907/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/node/14937 |archive-date=23 June 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although observers doubted the performance in endurance events due to air quality, humidity and temperature, the men's 10&amp;nbsp;km and marathon events did set new Olympic records. The Chinese authority pledged to continue their environmental efforts after the Games and pointed to their ¥140&amp;nbsp;billion investment in the past ten years as evidence of their determination. After witnessing the success of their efforts, some of the temporary measures during the Games are being considered for permanent enforcement.&lt;ref name=xinhua1/&gt;
&lt;!--
Nevertheless, on 19 August environmental officials{{Who|date=October 2008}} said pollution levels had met expected standards every day of the Olympics.{{Fact|date=October 2008}} On 30 September, the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] announced that a 'trial version' of milder traffic restrictions similar to the ones imposed during the Games would be put in place.{{Fact|date=October 2008}} These include restricting 30% of government vehicles from the road each day, and having all vehicles banned from the road one day per week based on license plate number.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}--&gt;

=== Pollution threats to sailing events ===
At the end of May 2008, two months before the start of the Olympics, a "[[red tide]]" (a type of [[algal bloom]]) was found to be developing. It began choking large stretches of the Qingdao near to the venue for the sailing events.&lt;ref name=algae&gt;{{cite news | title=Chinese race to clear algae from Olympic sailing venue | date=30 June 2008 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/30/pollution.olympicgames2008 | work=The Guardian | accessdate=27 August 2008  | location=London | first=Tania | last=Branigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; While algae blooms are known to develop in nutrient-rich water, often as a result of chemical pollution, run-off from heavy fertiliser use or untreated sewerage;&lt;ref name=promises&gt;{{cite news | title=Beijing promises no algae blooms in Games waters | date=3 July 2008 | url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/PEK365823.htm | agency=Reuters AlertNet | accessdate=27 August 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Qingdao's Ocean and Fishing Bureau said the particular temperature and salinity of sea water had been responsible in this case.&lt;ref name=algae/&gt;

Officials in Qingdao achieved their own target of 15 July to clear the algae in the vicinity of the venue.&lt;ref name=promises/&gt; The task force that cleaned-up more than a million tonnes of algae were said to number 1,200 boats&lt;ref name=promises/&gt; and many thousands of troops and volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=China says Olympic sailing venue now algae-free | date=15 July 2008 | url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/PEK211659.htm | agency=Reuters AlertNet | accessdate=27 August 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tourism ==
Prior to the Games, officials anticipated two million tourists, of which one-third would be from overseas. However, actual volume of visitors fell 9.2% year-on-year. Chinese officials cited the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|Sichuan earthquake]], [[2008 Tibetan unrest|riots in Tibet]], [[2008 Summer Olympics torch relay#Torch security|torch relay protests]] and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] as factors.&lt;ref name=vacancies&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/aug2008/gb20080819_224722.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business |date=19 August 2008
|title= Olympic Vacancies Haunt Beijing Hotels|work=Business Week|author=Chi-Chu Tschang }}&lt;/ref&gt; Locally, many people anticipated that Beijing would be too crowded during the Games. Businesses avoided scheduling meetings during these two weeks, and potential Chinese visitors decided to stay at home and watch the events on TV.

Initially, many hotel owners invested heavily for the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/la-fi-olympics22-2008aug22,0,5816776.story|title=Olympics disappoint China business owners| author=Don Lee|work=Los Angeles |date=22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many anticipated bookings in the 70% to 80% level, and room prices jumped as much as ten times the regular level.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/2456877/Beijing-hotels-drop-prices-as-low-turn-out-hits-Olympic-Games.html |title=Beijing hotels drop prices as low turn-out hits Olympic Games |work=The Daily Telegraph |author=Charles Starmer-Smith|date=25 July 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupancy of 77% was reported for luxury hotels in early August. For 4-star hotels and lower, occupancy of 40% led to price reductions, although still at three times the regular price.&lt;ref name=vacancies/&gt; In July, [[Air China]], the nation's flagship carrier, also saw its international passenger traffic fall by 19% from a year earlier.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=csm1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://features.csmonitor.com/olympics08/2008/08/18/for-beijing%e2%80%99s-businesses-the-games-fall-short-of-gold/ |title=For Beijing's businesses, the Games fall short of gold |author=Simon Montlake &amp; Peter Ford | work=The Christian Science Monitor|date=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoteliers blamed the lack of visitors on increased security measures and the tightening of visa rules and for driving out thousands of itinerant foreigners and overseas students living in Beijing. Visa requirements introduced in April required foreign visitors to have proof of their accommodation and return flight when applying to enter China. One foreign Olympics consultant was quoted as saying "they made it hard to get tickets and hard to get visas. The impression they gave was that they didn’t want foreigners to come".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=csm1/&gt;

According to the Beijing Olympic Organising Committee (BOCOG), the 6.8&amp;nbsp;million tickets to the Games were sold out. The prevalence of empty seats at many events caused journalists and visitors to be suspicious about these claims.&lt;ref name=sky&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Empty-Olympics-China-Busses-In-Locals-To-Fill-Beijing-Seats/Article/200808215076213?lpos=World%2BNews_3&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15076213_Empty%2BOlympics%253A%2BChina%2BBusses%2BIn%2BLocals%2BTo%2BFill%2BBeijing%2BSeats |title=Empty Olympics: China Busses In Locals To Fill Beijing Seats | publisher=Sky News |date=13 August 2008| accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beijing Olympic organisers were said to have given some 2.7&amp;nbsp;million tickets to officials and corporate sponsors, many of whom did not attend the events. A mainland journal suggested that the day-tickets without right of re-entry was also part of the problem.

&lt;li&gt;{{Note label|A|a|none}}Poor-quality air in China contributes to the death of about 400,000 Chinese annually. [[Ozone]] and fine [[particulate]] matter—bits of [[carbon]], [[sulfate]]s, and industrial [[by-product]]s— were the two biggest pollution threats to the athletes in 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2040">An '''EU-UK Customs Union''' is a proposal to have a [[Customs Union]] between a post [[Brexit]] United Kingdom and the [[European Union]].

As the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union, then it will not be able to participate in the [[EU's Common Commercial Policy]] and so continued membership of the [[EU Customs Union]] is not seen by most commentators as being viable.  Some commentators have suggested that there should be a bilateral Customs Union between the European Union and the UK on the same model of the [[European Union–Turkey Customs Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-what-are-the-options-for-the-irish-border-after-brexit What are the options for the Irish border after Brexit?], Georgina Lee, [[Channel 4]], 29 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-wales-politics-42230485/brexit-customs-union-would-solve-irish-border-carwyn-jones-says Brexit: Customs union would solve Irish border, Carwyn Jones says] First Minister of Wales, [[Carwyn Jones]], speaking to BBC Wales, 04 Dec 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics believe that the Customs Union between the UK and the EU is a minor part of resolving  cross border delays as it does not on its own deal with Single Market issues or the ability of non EU HGV drivers to drive on EU roads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ft.com/content/b4458652-f42d-11e6-8758-6876151821a6 Turkey border gridlock hints at pain to come for Brexit Britain] [[The Financial Times]], February 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Corbyn]], the leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)]], has backed an EU-UK Customs Union.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43189878&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House of Lords]] voted in April 2018 to force a negotiation of a Customs Union between the EU and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43812360|title=Brexit: Ministers suffer first defeat on EU Withdrawal Bill|publisher=BBC News|date=18 April 2018|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5567">'''Donnie Davies''' is a fictional character who is featured in a number of websites. Davies describes himself as an [[Anabaptist]] youth [[pastor]], "[[ex-gay|reformed homosexual]]", and lead singer for the band [[Evening Service]].  Davies and the band were unknown until the release of the music video for the anti-homosexuality song "The Bible Says" on the [[Internet]] in January 2007. Davies claims affiliation with the organization Love God's Way Ministries, which launched a website around the same time as the release of the video. He is also the founder and spokesman for the C.H.O.P.S. program.  The acronym stands for "Changing Homosexuals into Ordinary People Sexually". C.H.O.P.S. is promoted through Love God's Way's website.

His video was removed from YouTube.com without comment from the company and has been removed by Google. It has since been put back up on YouTube.&lt;ref name="Washington Blade"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Latest! |date=29 January 2007 |url=http://www.washblade.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=11101 |publisher=The Washington Blade |accessdate=2007-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928014409/http://www.washblade.com/thelatest/thelatest.cfm?blog_id=11101 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Much of the initial controversy revolved around whether or not Davies is genuinely promoting an anti-gay agenda, or if this is a [[viral marketing]] campaign. Some [[gay rights]] advocates acknowledge that as a spoof it is humorous, but claim the message behind it is still as malicious as someone who seriously possessed the opinion.&lt;ref name="Washington Blade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dan Savage"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dan Savage, "Slog" | url =http://www.thestranger.com/blog/2007/01/donnie_davies_third_times_the_charm | publisher =  The Stranger | date = 28 January 2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Philadelphia Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|title=One Big Conn: When Viral Marketing Misses Its Mark |date=31 January 2007 |url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=13936 |publisher=Philadelphia Weekly |accessdate=2007-02-02 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070210162142/http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=13936 |archivedate=2007-02-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Debate has quickly risen regarding the authenticity of Davies' youth ministry activities, the band Evening Service, and the organization Love God's Way ranging from entertainment publications such as ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''&lt;ref name="Spin Magazine"&gt;{{cite web | title = Donnie Davies: Real McCoy or Offensive Gag? | date = 24 January 2007 | url = http://www.spin.com/features/everybodystalkingabout/2007/01/070124_eveningservice/ | publisher = Spin | accessdate = 2007-02-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070202031643/http://www.spin.com/features/everybodystalkingabout/2007/01/070124_eveningservice/ | archivedate = 2 February 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; to thousands of personal [[blogs]][http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Donnie+Davies%22+&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a]  Some in the [[blogosphere]] maintained that Davies was truly  seeking to "convert" other homosexuals to [[heterosexuality]] {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. Others considered Davies ministry and the video part of a carefully designed [[hoax]] mocking the [[Christian right|Christian Conservative]] community. Other controversies involve the claims on Donnie's website of what music "will make you gay." This included some of his own music.&lt;ref name="Cinema Blend"&gt;{{cite web | title = Music Makes You Gay? | date = 30 January 2007 | url =http://www.cinemablend.com/music/RANT-Liking-Good-Music-Makes-You-Gay-2587.html | publisher =  Cinema Blend | accessdate = 2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay rights organizations, such as Heartstrong,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heartstrong.org/HeartStrong/DonnieDaviesHates.html Heartstrong]&lt;/ref&gt; are addressing this as a serious threat to the gay community.

Several blogs speculated that Donnie Davies was a character created by [[Improvisational theatre|improv]] actor Todd Quillen&lt;ref name="Joe.My.God."&gt;{{cite web | title = Donnie Davies = Todd Quillen? | date = 25 January 2007 | url =http://joemygod.blogspot.com/2007/01/donnie-davies-todd-quillen.html | publisher =  Joe.My.God. | accessdate = 2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; or out gay director [[Jason Bolicki]].&lt;ref name="Slog"&gt;{{cite web | title = Donnie “God Hates a Fag” Davies: Radar Weighs In | date = 25 January 2007 | url =http://slog.thestranger.com/2007/01/donnie_god_hates_a_fag_davies_radar_weig | publisher =  The Stranger | accessdate = 2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 February 2007, [[MTV News]] Webcam Correspondent posted a video on [[YouTube]], proving Donnie Davies to be a character played by actor [[Joey Oglesby]]. The piece interviewed the actor and director and included their surprise that anyone took the video as being serious.

The '''EMD G12''' was a class of locomotive built by [[GM-EMD]], and its Canadian affiliate [[General Motors Diesel]]. In addition, Australian licensee [[Clyde Engineering]] built ten locomotives for New Zealand in 1957, five for Hong Kong, 23 for Queensland, 14 for Western Australia and seven for [[BHP Billiton|BHP]]. Australian licensee  [[Commonwealth Engineering]] also built 42 for [[Queensland Rail]] in 1964–66. Many examples were built in the 1950-1960s for railroads all over the world. They are powered by [[EMD 567|EMD 12-567C]] prime movers rated at {{convert|1250|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Some have been rebuilt with [[EMD 645]] engines.

The '''Gamergate controversy''' stemmed from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the [[hashtag]] #GamerGate. The controversy centered on issues of [[Sexism in video gaming|sexism]] and [[progressivism]] in video game culture. ''Gamergate'' is used as a blanket term for the controversy as well as for the harassment campaign and actions of those participating in it.

In August 2014, the harassment campaign targeted several women in the [[video game industry]]; notably game developers [[Zoë Quinn]] and [[Brianna Wu]], as well as feminist media critic [[Anita Sarkeesian]]. After Eron Gjoni, Quinn's former boyfriend, wrote a disparaging blog post about her, #gamergate hashtag users falsely accused Quinn of an unethical relationship with journalist Nathan Grayson. Harassment campaigns against Quinn and others included [[doxing]], threats of rape, and death threats. 

Gamergate proponents ("Gamergaters") said that they were a movement, but had no official leaders, spokespeople, or manifesto.  Gamergate supporters organized anonymously or [[Pseudonymity|pseudonymously]] on online platforms such as [[4chan]], [[Internet Relay Chat]], [[Twitter]], and [[Reddit]]. Statements claiming to represent Gamergate have been inconsistent and contradictory, making it difficult for commentators to identify goals and motives. Gamergate supporters said there was unethical collusion between the press and feminists, progressives, and social critics. These concerns have been dismissed by commentators as trivial, conspiracy theories, groundless, or unrelated to actual issues of ethics. As a result, Gamergate has often been defined by the harassment its supporters engaged in. Gamergate supporters have frequently responded to this by denying that the harassment took place or by falsely claiming that it was manufactured by the victims.

The controversy has been described as a manifestation of a [[culture war]] over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers. Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of [[feminism]] on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a [[right-wing]] backlash against progressivism. 

Industry responses to the harassment campaign have focused on ways to minimise harm and prevent similar events. Gamergate has led figures both inside and outside the industry to focus on methods of addressing online harassment.

==History==

===Zoë Quinn and ''Depression Quest''===
In 2013, [[Zoë Quinn]], an independent game developer, released ''[[Depression Quest]]'', a text-focused game designed to convey the experience of depression though a series of fictional scenarios,{{refn|name=Kidd &amp; Turner}}{{refn|name=Massanari 2017}} based in part on Quinn's own experience with the illness.{{refn|name=Hanson}}{{refn|name=Parkin}} The game received positive reviews in the gaming media, but faced backlash online from gamers who disliked its departure from typical game formats emphasizing violence and skill&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jane|2017|p=30}}; {{harvp|Salter|2017|p=43}};  {{harvp|Mantilla|2015|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who opposed "political" intrusions into gamer culture.{{refn|name=Salter}} Quinn was subjected to several months of harassment after its release,&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KernelMag" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt; including rape and death threats.{{refn|name=Massanari 2017}}{{refn|name=Jane}} Quinn documented the harassment she received and spoke openly to the media about it, which led to an even greater intensity of abuse against her, including the posting of her home address online.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=43–45}} She ultimately fled her house out of fear for her safety.{{refn|name=Parkin}}{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=44}}

[[File:Zoe Quinn Car 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Game developer [[Zoë Quinn]], the initial target of the harassment campaign]]

The event that would come to be known as Gamergate began in 2014 as a personal attack on Quinn, incited by a blog post by Quinn's former boyfriend Eron Gjoni.{{sfnp|Jane|2017|p=29}}{{refn|name=Hanson}}{{refn|name=Mantilla}} Called the "Zoe Post",{{efn |Gjoni initially published the post on the video-game sites ''[[Penny Arcade]]'' and ''[[Something Awful]]''. After it was removed by the sites' moderators, Gjoni published "The Zoe Post" via the blogging platform WordPress.{{refn|name=Jason}}}} it was a lengthy, detailed account of their relationship and breakup{{sfnp|Jane|2017|pp=29-30}} that included copies of personal chat logs, emails, and text messages.&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt; The blog falsely implied that Quinn had gotten a favorable review of ''Depression Quest'' because of her sexual relationship with Nathan Grayson, a video-game reviewer for the website ''[[Kotaku]]''.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=44}}{{sfnp|Jane|2017|p=30}}{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=316}}{{sfnp|Mantilla|2015|p=84}} Grayson never actually reviewed Quinn's games, and Grayson's only article mentioning her was published before their relationship began.&lt;ref name="Singal September 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcmag about gg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="canadacom" /&gt; Gjoni later updated his blog post to acknowledge this,&lt;ref name="pcmag about gg" /&gt; saying that a typographical error was to blame.{{refn|name=Jane}} Nonetheless, a link to the blog posted on [[4chan]], where many participants had previously been highly critical of ''Depression Quest'', led to renewed attacks on Quinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jane|2017|p=30}}; {{harvp|Salter|2017|p=44}}; {{harvp|Murray|2018|p=36}}; {{harvp|Mantilla|2015|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gjoni's blog post, Quinn and her family were subjected to a virulent and often [[misogynistic]] harassment campaign.&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;&lt;ref name="nybooks 2015-06-25" /&gt;&lt;ref name=HeronBelford2014/&gt; Online attackers of Quinn at first used the label "Quinnspiracy",{{refn|name=Singal September 2014}}{{refn|name=Shaw &amp; Chess 2016}}{{refn|name=Aghazadeh et al}} later adopting the [[hashtag]] "#Gamergate" after it was coined by the actor [[Adam Baldwin]],{{efn |Baldwin, known for his right-wing political views,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kidd|Turner|2016|p=130}}; {{harvp|Salter|2017|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; tweeted the hashtag #GamerGate near the end of August alongside a pair of videos promoting the "Quinnspiracy" by a YouTube user called Internet Aristocrat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kidd|Turner|2016|pp=129–130}}; {{harvp|Shaw|Chess|2016|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later tell an interviewer that a left-wing "culture war" was imposing "political crap" on gamers.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=45}}{{refn|name=Kaufman}}}} whose nearly 190,000 Twitter followers helped the spread of the hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salter|2017|p=45}}; {{harvp|Murray|2018|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harassment of Gamergate targets was coordinated via [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), spreading rapidly over [[imageboard]]s and forums like 4chan and [[Reddit]].&lt;ref name="TeleStuart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Massanari 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt;

Within four months of the start of Gamergate, Quinn's record of threats she had received had grown 1,000-fold.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=45}}{{refn|name=Jason}} At a conference Quinn said, "I used to go to game events and feel like I was going home&amp;nbsp;[...] Now it's just like... are any of the people I'm currently in the room with ones that said they wanted to beat me to death?".&lt;ref name=BBCQuinnInterview /&gt; One anonymous 4chan user threatened to "give her a crippling injury that's never going to fully heal".{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=45}}{{sfnp|Mantilla|2015|p=86}}{{refn|name=Parkin}} Commentators both inside and outside the video game industry condemned the attacks against Quinn.&lt;ref name="dot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal September 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DBMarcotte" /&gt; The attacks included [[doxing]] (researching and broadcasting personally identifiable information about an individual) and hacking of her [[Tumblr]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], and [[Skype]] accounts; she was again subjected to rape and death threats.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DBMarcotte" /&gt; Quinn again fled her home to stay with friends.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=45}}{{sfnp|Mantilla|2015|p=86}}{{refn|name=Jason}} She wrote that "the Internet spent the last month spreading my personal information around, sending me threats, hacking anyone suspected of being friends with me, calling my dad and telling him I’m a whore, sending nude photos of me to colleagues, and basically giving me the 'burn the witch' treatment".&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, quoted in {{harvp|Mantilla|2015|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=Singal September 2014}}

===Other targets of harassment===

Gamergate supporters subjected others to similar harassment, doxing, and death threats. Those who came to the victims' defense were ridiculed as "white knights", or "[[social justice warrior]]s" (SJWs);&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014" /&gt; this characterization was intended, according to Heron, Belford and Goker, to neutralize any opposition by questioning their motives.&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014" /&gt; Shortly after the Gamergate hashtag was coined, video game developer [[Phil Fish]] had his personal information, including various accounts and passwords, hacked and publicly posted in retaliation for defending Quinn and attacking her detractors.&lt;ref name=FishPaste/&gt;&lt;ref name=BI/&gt; The hacks and doxing also exposed documents relating to Fish's company, Polytron.&lt;ref name=DailyFish/&gt; As a result, Fish left the gaming industry and put Polytron up for sale, calling the situation "unacceptable" and saying, "it's not worth it".&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;&lt;ref name=FishPaste/&gt;&lt;ref name="gs fish" /&gt;

[[File:Anita Sarkeesian 2013.jpg|thumb|Feminist and media critic [[Anita Sarkeesian]] received death threats after releasing a ''[[Tropes vs. Women in Video Games]]'' video.]]

The campaign expanded to include renewed harassment of prominent&lt;ref name="prominent 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prominent 2" /&gt; feminist media critic [[Anita Sarkeesian]], who had previously been a target of online harassment due in part to her YouTube video series ''[[Tropes vs. Women in Video Games]]'', which analyzes sexist stereotypes in video games.&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt; Sarkeesian's attackers took her critical commentary as unfair and unwarranted, and considered her an interloper.&lt;ref name="TheStar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TorontoExclusive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cosmo" /&gt; After a new episode of ''Tropes vs. Women'' was released on August 24, 2014, Sarkeesian received rape and death threats, and private information including her home address was leaked; she was compelled to flee her home.&lt;ref name="BusinessWeekSarkessian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashPostSarkeesian" /&gt; At the [[XOXO (festival)|XOXO]] arts and technology conference in Portland, Oregon, she said, in regard to the accusations that high-profile women were making up the threats against them, that "one of the most radical things you can do is to actually believe women when they talk about their experiences". "The perpetrators", Sarkeesian went on to say, "do not see themselves as perpetrators at all&amp;nbsp;[...] They see themselves as noble warriors".&lt;ref name=VergeXOXO /&gt;

Sarkeesian canceled an October 2014 speaking appearance at [[Utah State University]] (USU) after the school received three anonymous threats, the second of which claimed affiliation with Gamergate.&lt;ref name="SLT ALberty101614" /&gt; The initial threat proposed that "a Montreal Massacre style attack will be carried out against the attendees, as well as the students and staff at the nearby Women's Center", alluding to the [[École Polytechnique massacre]], a 1989 mass shooting motivated by [[antifeminism]].&lt;ref name="montreal-massacre-threat-ctv" /&gt; USU's President and Provost released a joint statement saying that USU, in consultation with state and federal law enforcement agencies, had assessed that there was no credible threat to students, staff or the speaker.&lt;ref name=USUthreat/&gt;  Requests for additional security measures were declined because of Utah's [[Open carry in the United States|open carry]] laws, leading to the cancellation.&lt;ref name="nytimes usu threat" /&gt;&lt;ref name=AnitaUSUCNN /&gt;&lt;ref name=AnitaUSUBBC /&gt;  The threats drew the attention of mainstream media to the Gamergate situation.&lt;ref name="venturebeat mainstream"/&gt; Wingfield of ''The New York Times'' referred to the threat as "the most noxious example of a weeks long campaign to discredit or intimidate outspoken critics of the male-dominated gaming industry and its culture".&lt;ref name="nytimes usu threat" /&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) investigated the threat to attack Sarkeesian and other Gamergate-related threats.&lt;ref name=HJFBI/&gt; The investigations, which were plagued with jurisdictional issues, ultimately closed with the FBI failing to identify the perpetrators of some threats and declining to prosecute others.&lt;ref name="FBI 2017Jan27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verge fbi closed" /&gt;
[[File:Brianna Wu next to Motorcycle.jpg|thumb|Video game developer [[Brianna Wu]] suffered Gamergate-related harassment beginning in late 2014.]]

In mid-October [[Brianna Wu]], another independent game developer and co-founder of video game studio [[Giant Spacekat (company)|Giant Spacekat]], saw her home address and other identifying information posted on [[8chan]] as retaliation for mocking Gamergate. Wu then became the target of rape and death threats on Twitter and elsewhere. After contacting police, Wu fled her home with her husband, saying she would not allow the threats to intimidate her into silence.&lt;ref name="nytimes usu threat" /&gt;&lt;ref name=WuBoston /&gt;&lt;ref name=GlobeFeature /&gt; Wu announced an {{US$|11000}} reward for information leading to a conviction for those involved in her harassment, and set up a legal fund to help other game developers who have been harassed online.&lt;ref name="wu reward"/&gt; As of April 2016, Wu was still receiving threats in such volume that she employed full-time staff to document them.&lt;ref name="csm 20160411" /&gt;

Harassment related to Gamergate continued for several months after the onset of the controversy. Two critics of Gamergate were targets of attempted "[[swatting]]"—hoaxed reports to emergency services intended to provoke a [[SWAT]] team response at the target's home. ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that both swatting attempts were coordinated through the "[[Baphomet#Modern interpretations and usage|baphomet]]" subforum of 8chan.&lt;ref name="ars swatting" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian swatting" /&gt; After the initial rush of threats that caused her to flee her home, Wu documented receiving roughly 45 death threats by April 2015; Silicon Valley investor [[Marc Andreessen]] offered up to a $10,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of those who made the threats.&lt;ref name="inc" /&gt; Wu's studio, Giant Spacekat, withdrew from the Expo Hall of [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX East 2015]]. Wu cited security concerns, lack of confidence in the management and their failure to return calls.&lt;ref name="wu pax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="venturebeat 2015-02-19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bostonglobe 2015-02-24" /&gt;

Actress and gamer [[Felicia Day]] wrote a blog post about her concerns over Gamergate and her fear of retaliation if she spoke against it. Almost immediately her home address and phone number were posted online, leading to harassing letters and phone calls.&lt;ref name="seattletimes 2015-09-21" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DayGuardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=DayTime /&gt; Actor [[Wil Wheaton]] and former [[NFL]] player [[Chris Kluwe]] also posted criticisms of Gamergate. [[Stephen Colbert]] questioned why men like Kluwe had not been threatened by Gamergate, noting that the targets were almost entirely women.&lt;ref name=ColbertVerge /&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPoColbert /&gt;

Some who have identified as Gamergate supporters said that they have been harassed.&lt;ref name=Diver /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tsukayama /&gt; YouTube personality [[Boogie2988|Steven "Boogie2988" Williams]] remarked that a comment on one of his videos included his address and a threat to his wife's life.&lt;ref name=Diver /&gt;&lt;ref name=Codd /&gt; In an interview with [[BBC Three (online)|BBC Three]], Gamergate supporter [[TotalBiscuit|John Bain]], known by his YouTube moniker "TotalBiscuit", said he had been the target of death threats and harassment from anonymous people who opposed his view on Gamergate.&lt;ref name="bbc3 2016-03-16" /&gt; Mike Diver wrote in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' that threats against Gamergate supporters had been neglected in press coverage.&lt;ref name=Diver /&gt; According to the BBC, the technology writer [[Allum Bokhari]] said that a "well-known trolling group" was "working to provoke both sides against each other".&lt;ref name="bbc gg condemned"/&gt;

Bomb threats have also been made towards events attended by Gamergate supporters. A May 2015 meeting in Washington D.C. arranged by writer [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] and journalist [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] was the target of a bomb threat made over Twitter, according to local police responding to information supplied by the FBI.&lt;ref name="polygon 2015-05-03" /&gt; During "Airplay", an event run by the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] in August 2015, multiple bomb threats were made. This led to the evacuation of the building and the surrounding neighborhood.&lt;ref name="polygon 2015-08-16"/&gt;

===Coordination of harassment===

Gamergate harassment was orchestrated largely through anonymous message boards such as [[4chan]], [[8chan]], and [[Reddit]],{{refn|name=Nieborg &amp; Foxman}}{{sfnp|Murray|2018|p=36}}{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=41}} particularly the "KotakuInAction" [[Subreddits|subreddit]].&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=47}} ''[[Ars Technica]]'' reported that a series of 4chan discussion logs suggests that Twitter [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppet]] accounts were used to popularize the Gamergate hashtag.&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt; Heron, Belford, and Goker, analyzing the logs, said that early Gamergate IRC discussions focused on coordinating the harassment of Quinn by using [[Astroturfing|astroturf]] campaigns to push attacks against her into mainstream view. They also describe how initial organizers attempted to cultivate a palpable narrative for public consumption while internally focusing on personal grudges against Quinn and aggressive sexual imagery.&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014" /&gt; Mortensen wrote in ''[[Games and Culture]]'' that Gamergate's structure as an anonymous swarm allowed it to create an environment where anyone who criticized it or became its target was at risk, while allowing them to avoid individual responsibility for harassment.&lt;ref name="Mortensen2016" /&gt;

There has been considerable discussion of [[Norm (social)|self-policing]] and the [[Collective responsibility|responsibility]] supporters of Gamergate share when the hashtag is used for harassment. A number of websites have blocked users, removed posts, and created policies to prevent their users from threatening Quinn and others with doxing, assault, rape and murder, and planning and coordinating such threats.&lt;ref name=csmonitor /&gt;&lt;ref name=dot /&gt; 4chan founder [[Christopher Poole]] banned all discussion of Gamergate on the site as more attacks occurred, leading to Gamergate supporters using 8chan as their central hub.&lt;ref name="Massanari 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapost 8chan"/&gt;

Many Gamergate supporters have denied that the harassment took place, or falsely accused victims of fabricating the evidence.&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashPostSarkeesian" /&gt; Gamergate supporters have used the term "Literally Who" to refer to victims of harassment such as Quinn, saying they are not relevant to Gamergate's goals and purposes. Commentators have decried the use of such terminology as dehumanizing, and said that discussions on Gamergate forums often center around those referred to as "Literally Who".&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DipCour"/&gt; Some Gamergate supporters have denounced the harassment, arguing that the perpetrators are in the minority and do not represent them.&lt;ref name=Diver /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tsukayama /&gt;

By September 24, 2014, over one million Twitter messages incorporating the Gamergate hashtag had been sent.&lt;ref name="metro what is gg" /&gt; A ''[[Newsweek]]'' and [[Brandwatch]] analysis found more than two million Twitter messages between September and October 2014.&lt;ref name="Newsweek Brandwatch" /&gt; Software developer [[Andy Baio]] also produced an analysis of #Gamergate tweets showing a discussion that was polarized between pro- and anti-Gamergate factions. One quarter of the tweets sampled were produced by users new to Twitter, most of whom were pro-Gamergate.&lt;ref name="fastcodesign 2014-10-28" /&gt; While the number of Gamergate supporters is unclear, in October 2014 ''[[Deadspin]]'' estimated 10,000 supporters based on the number of users discussing Gamergate on Reddit.&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt;

==Organization==

The series of events that came to be known as Gamergate has been described as "torturously complex".{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}} As a movement, it had no official leaders or clearly defined agenda.{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|pp=113-114}}{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=41–42}} Because of its anonymous membership, lack of organization and leaderless nature, sources differ as to the goals or mission of Gamergate and defining it has been difficult.&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014" /&gt; Frank Lantz of [[NYU]]'s Game Center wrote that he could not find "a single explanation of a coherent Gamergate position".&lt;ref&gt;Lantz, quoted in {{harvp|Meyer|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Grant, editor-in-chief of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', told the ''Columbia Journalism Review'': "The closest thing we've been able to divine is that it's noise. It's chaos&amp;nbsp;[...] all you can do is find patterns. And ultimately Gamergate will be defined—I think has been defined—by some of its basest elements."&lt;ref&gt;Grant, quoted in {{harvp|Salter|2017|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt;

As the threats expanded, international media focused on Gamergate's violent, misogynistic element and its inability to present a coherent message. Bob Stuart, in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]],'' reported that "Gamergate has since swelled into an unwieldy movement with no apparent leaders, mission statement, or aims beyond calling out 'social justice warriors'.&amp;nbsp;[...] When members of the games industry are being driven from their houses and jobs, threatened, or abused, it makes Gamergate's claim that it is engaged in an ethical campaign appear laughable."&lt;ref name=TeleStuart /&gt; The campaign's focus broadened to take on other targets in the news media, as with [[Bollea v. Gawker|Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media]].&lt;ref name="NYTThielGawker" /&gt;

Jesse Singal, in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', stated that he had spoken to several Gamergate supporters to try to understand their concerns, but found conflicting ideals and incoherent messages. Singal observed Gamergate supporters making a constant series of attacks on Quinn, Sarkeesian, and other women, while frequently stating that Gamergate "is not about" them.&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014" /&gt; Chris Ip of the ''Columbia Journalism Review'' said that any legitimate message from Gamergate supporters regarding ethics in journalism was lost in the noise created by harassment, sexism, and misogyny.{{Verify source|date=May 2018}} With anyone able to tweet under the hashtag and no single person willing or able to represent the hashtag and take responsibility for its actions, Ip said it is not possible for journalists to neatly separate abusers from those seeking reasonable debate.&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt; 

[[Jon Stone (poet)|Jon Stone]] wrote in ''The Guardian'' that {{Nowrap|"[Gamergate]}} readjusts and reinvents itself in response to attempts to disarm and disperse its noxiousness, subsuming disaffected voices in an act of continual regeneration, cycling through targets, pretexts, manifestoes, and moralisms".&lt;ref name="Ryan Cooper Week" /&gt; ''Polygon''{{'}}s Grant said that Gamergate has remained amorphous and leaderless so that the harassment can be conducted without any culpability.&lt;ref name="OTMGrant" /&gt;{{Time needed|date=May 2018}}

===Harassment and Twitter===

While organized through anonymous message boards such as 4chan and Reddit, Gamergate harassment was most prominent on Twitter. Michael Salter, a [[University of Western Sydney]] criminologist,  writes that Twitter's design and architecture was "highly conducive" to such abuse campaigns, allowing Gamergaters to overwhelm users' ability to individually block the large numbers of fake or "sockpuppet" accounts used to send abusive and harassing messages.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=47–48}} 

Twitter was criticized for its inability to respond quickly and prevent harassment over the service. Within the United States, Twitter and other social media sites are not liable for content posted by third-parties of their service under [[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act]] (1996), and so have no legal obligation to police malicious content such as harassment and threats.&lt;ref name="fastcompany 2015-06-02" /&gt; Brianna Wu, shortly after becoming a target of harassment, stated that Twitter facilitated harassment by the ease with which anyone could make a new account even after having an earlier account blocked, and challenged the service to improve its responsiveness to complaints.&lt;ref name="businessweek wu twitter"/&gt; Robinson Meyer of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' said Gamergate is an "identity crisis" for Twitter, and by not dealing with harassing users, the platform is failing to protect victims.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;

Early on during Gamergate, software developer Randi Harper started the "Good Game Auto Blocker" or "ggautoblocker", an expanding list of known Twitter accounts that were tied to the Gamergate hashtag which could be automatically [[block (Internet)|blocked]], therefore reducing the degree of harassment received.&lt;ref name="verge 2015-06-10" /&gt; In November 2014, Twitter announced a collaboration with the non-profit group "Women, Action &amp; the Media" (WAM), in which users of Twitter can report harassment to a tool monitored by WAM members, who would forward affirmed issues to Twitter within 24 hours. The move, while arising in the wake of the Gamergate harassment, was due to general issues of the harassment of women on the Internet.&lt;ref name="wiredWAMTwitterHarassment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheVergeWAMTwitter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wam release" /&gt; In May 2015, WAM reported that of 512 reported harassment instances by the tool during the month of November 2014, 12% of those were tied to the Gamergate controversy based on the ggautoblocker list, with most harassment occurring from single-instance accounts targeting a single person.&lt;ref name="wam report" /&gt;

===Efforts to affect public perceptions===

Early in the controversy, posters on 4chan focused on donating to a self-described [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] group called [[The Fine Young Capitalists]] (TFYC), who had been embroiled in a dispute with Quinn over a female-only game development contest they had organized. Advocating donations to help TFYC create the game, posters on 4chan's politics board argued that such donations would make them "look really good" and would make them "PR-untouchable".&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fastcodesign 2014-11-03" /&gt;

To respond to widespread criticism of Gamergate as misogynistic, posters on 4chan created a second Twitter hashtag, #NotYourShield, intended to show that Gamergate was not about opposition to feminism or wanting to push women out of gaming. In the 4chan post that may have coined the hashtag, it was framed as a way to "demand the SJWs stop using you as a shield to deflect genuine criticism".&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyDot /&gt; Many of the accounts used to tweet the tag seemed to be [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppets]] that had copied their avatars from elsewhere on the internet; the methods used to create it have been compared to #EndFathersDay, a hoax manufactured on 4chan using similar methods.&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyDot /&gt; Quinn said that in light of Gamergate's exclusive targeting of women or those who stood up for women, "#notyourshield was, ironically, solely designed to be a shield for this campaign once people started calling it misogynistic".&lt;ref name=Escapist4chan /&gt; [[Arthur Chu]] wrote that the hashtag was an attempt to leverage [[white guilt]] and to prevent allies from supporting the people being attacked by Gamergate.&lt;ref name="Chu2014" /&gt;

===Targeting advertisers===

Gamergate supporters were critical of the wave of articles calling for diversity that followed the initial outbreak of the controversy; interpreting them as an attack on games and gamer culture. Gamergaters responded with a coordinated email campaign that demanded advertisers drop several involved publications; in a five-step 'war plan' against organizations that offended them, a Gamergate posting described how they would choose from a list of target organizations, pick a grievance from a list others had compiled, and send a form letter containing it to an advertiser.&lt;ref name=waposuccess /&gt; [[Intel]] reacted to this by withdrawing an ad campaign from Gamasutra in October 2014. After a number of game developers criticized Intel for this, arguing that it could have a chilling effect on free speech and that it amounted to supporting harassment, Intel apologized for appearing to take sides in the controversy&lt;ref name="GIBizIntel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VergeIntelStatement" /&gt; and resumed advertising on Gamasutra in mid-November.&lt;ref name="Intel_Telegraph" /&gt;

===Sad Puppies===
Gamergate became associated with the "[[Sad Puppies]]" and "Rabid Puppies" during [[Hugo Awards#Since 2000|2015 Hugo Awards]] for science fiction writing. These groups organized [[voting bloc]]s that dominated the 2015 Hugo Awards. The campaign was described as a backlash against the increasing racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in science fiction. Members of the bloc said that they sought to counteract what they saw as a focus on giving awards based on the race, ethnicity, or gender of the author or characters rather than quality, and bemoaning the increasing prominence of what they described as 'message' fiction with fewer traditional "zap gun" sciencefictional trappings.&lt;ref name="atlantic 2015-04-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes 2015-08-24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired 2015-08-23" /&gt; By 2018, the Sad Puppies had diminished visibility, and Quinn's 2017 memoir, ''[[Crash Override: How Gamergate (Nearly) Destroyed My Life, and How We Can Win the Fight Against Online Hate]]'', was nominated for the 2018 [[Hugo Award for Best Related Work]] (for non-fiction works related to science fiction or fantasy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.tor.com/2018/03/31/2018-hugo-award-finalists-announced/ |title=2018 Hugo Award Finalists Announced |date=2018-03-31 |work=Tor.com |access-date=2018-08-27 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics in journalism complaints==
The most active Gamergate supporters or "Gamergaters"{{sfnp|Barnes|2018|p=94}}{{refn|name=Braithwaite}} said that Gamergate was a movement for ethics in games journalism and that any harassment of women was done by others not affiliated with Gamergate.{{refn|name=Massanari 2017}}{{refn|name=Jane}}{{sfnp|Barnes|2018|p=94}} They argued that the close relationships between journalists and developers demonstrated a conspiracy among reviewers to focus on progressive social issues,&lt;ref name="KernelMag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014"/&gt; leading to conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Straumsheim2015" /&gt; Some supporters pointed to what they considered disproportionate praise for games such as ''[[Depression Quest]]'' and ''[[Gone Home]]'', which feature unconventional gameplay and stories with social implications, while they viewed traditional [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA games]]  as downplayed.&lt;ref name="overland" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTSuellentrop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="willametteweek" /&gt; Journalists who did not cover the examination into Quinn's private life were accused of conspiracy, and a [[blacklist]] circulated by Gamergate supporters.&lt;ref name=ibtimes1 /&gt;

Observers in the media have largely rejected these claims as baseless. Chris Ip of the ''Columbia Journalism Review'' wrote that "many criticisms of press coverage by people who identify with Gamergate&amp;nbsp;[...] have been debunked" and concluded that "at core, the movement is a classic culture war".&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt; Writing in ''Vox'', Todd VanDerWerff said that "[e]very single question of journalistic ethics Gamergate has brought up has either been debunked or dealt with".&lt;ref name=VoxLose /&gt; According to [[Leigh Alexander (journalist)|Leigh Alexander]], then editor-at-large of ''Gamasutra'', the ethics concerns were a [[conspiracy theory]], albeit a sincere one; Alexander writes that there is nothing unethical about journalists being acquainted with those they cover and that meaningful reporting requires journalists to develop professional relationships with sources.&lt;ref name=Time /&gt; ''Ars Technica'', ''Vox'', and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', among others, stated that discussions of gender equality, sexism and other social issues in game reviews present no ethical conflict.&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mortensen2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsweek Brandwatch"/&gt;&lt;ref name=VoxLose /&gt;&lt;ref name=WiredHudson /&gt;&lt;ref name=UWiscCulver/&gt;

Several writers who attempted to understand Gamergate's motivations concluded that, rather than relating to purported issues with gaming journalism ethics, Gamergate represented an effort to suppress opposing views.&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VergeDead" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoRosenberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Internet Monitor 2014" /&gt; Salter writes that "mass media had a decisive role in evaluating the competing claims of Gamergate and its critics, and ultimately dismissing Gamergate as a misogynist abuse campaign".{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=55}} Screenshots of 4chan boards, collected and published by Quinn, suggested that complaints about ethics in games journalism were invented ''post hoc'' by Gamergaters to distract critics from their ongoing abuse of her.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|p=46}}{{refn|name=Johnston September 2014}} Jay Hathaway wrote at ''Gawker'' that this strategy emerged once Gamergaters found that harassing Quinn about her sexual history was unlikely to win them support; according to Hathaway, IRC chat logs showed that "the [Gamergate] movement was focused on destroying Zoë Quinn first, reforming games reporting second".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvp|Mantilla|2015|p=85}} (attributed to T.C. Sottek)&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=Hathaway}}

Other commentators argued that Gamergate had the potential to raise significant issues in gaming journalism, but that the wave of misogynistic harassment and abuse associated with the hashtag had [[poisoned the well]], making it impossible to separate honest criticism from sexist trolling.&lt;ref name=goldman /&gt;&lt;ref name="HeronBelford2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vox /&gt; Visible support for Gamergate in the form of tweets, online videos, and blogs seldom involved discussion of ethics, but often featured misogynistic and/or racist commentary.&lt;ref name="Massanari 2017"/&gt; The targets were mainly female game developers, academics, and writers.{{sfnp|Jane|2017|p=33}}

Researchers at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] at [[Harvard University]] described Gamergate as a "vitriolic campaign against Quinn that quickly morph[ed] into a broader crusade against alleged corruption in games journalism" which involved considerable abuse and harassment of female developers and game critics.&lt;ref name="Internet Monitor 2014" /&gt; Concerns have also been raised when juxtaposing the behavior of Gamergate supporters with their claimed message: Dr. Kathleen Bartzen Culver, a professor and media ethics expert at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], wrote that while Gamergate supporters claimed to be interested in journalism ethics, their "misogynistic and threatening" behavior belied this claim. "Much of the conversation—if I can even call it that—has been a toxic sludge of rumor, invective, and gender bias. The irony comes from people who claim to be challenging the ethics of game journalists through patently unethical behavior."&lt;ref name=UWiscCulver/&gt;

After analyzing a sample of tweets related to Gamergate, ''Newsweek'' concluded that it was primarily about harassment rather than ethics, stating that the sample "suggests that&amp;nbsp;[...] contrary to its stated goal, Gamergate spends more time tweeting negatively at game developers than at game journalists".&lt;ref name="Newsweek Brandwatch"/&gt; Casey Johnston wrote for ''Ars Technica'' that, based on logs from the 4chan users who initially pushed Gamergate into the spotlight, the goal behind the hashtag campaign was to "perpetuate misogynistic attacks by wrapping them in a debate about ethics".&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt; An academic analysis of a week's worth of public posts tagged with #Gamergate found that the [[issue public]]s involved were not "only or even primarily" concerned with ethics in gaming journalism.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess &amp; Matamoros-Fernández, quoted in {{harvp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BurgessMatamoros-Fernández2016" /&gt;

In an interview with Anita Sarkeesian in ''The Guardian'', [[Jessica Valenti]] said that "the movement's much-mocked mantra, 'It's about ethics in journalism{{'"}} was seen by others as "a natural extension of sexist harassment and the fear of female encroachment on a traditionally male space". Sarkeesian asked, "if this 'movement' was about journalism, why wasn't it journalists who had to deal with a barrage of rape and death threats?".&lt;ref name="guardian aug2015"/&gt; Wu told ''The Boston Globe'' that the ethics claims were "a pretext" and described Gamergate as "an actual hate group&amp;nbsp;[...] they're upset and threatened by women who are being very outspoken about feminism".&lt;ref&gt;Wu, quoted in {{harvp|Murray|2018|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bray"/&gt;

Gamergate has been criticized for focusing on women, especially female developers, while ignoring many large-scale journalistic ethics issues. Alex Goldman of NPR's ''On the Media'' criticized Gamergate for targeting female indie developers rather than [[AAA (game industry)|AAA games publishers]], and said claims of unethical behavior by Quinn and Sarkeesian were unfounded.&lt;ref name=goldman /&gt; In ''Wired'', Laura Hudson found it telling that Gamergate supporters concentrated on impoverished independent creators and critics, and nearly exclusively women, rather than the large game companies whose work they enjoyed.&lt;ref name=WiredHudson /&gt; ''Vox'' writer Todd VanDerWerff highlighted an essay written by game developer David Hill, who said that corruption, [[nepotism]], and excessive [[commercialism]] existed in the gaming industry, but that Gamergate was not addressing those issues.&lt;ref name=VoxConfuse /&gt; Adi Robertson, of ''The Verge'', commented on the long-standing ethical issues gaming journalism has dealt with, but that most Gamergate supporters did not seem interested in "addressing problems that don't directly relate to feminist criticism or the tiny indie games scene".&lt;ref name=VergeDay/&gt;

{{anchor|GameJournoPros}}In mid-September 2014, [[Milo Yiannopoulos]], vocal critic of feminism and left-wing ideologies, published leaked discussions from a mailing list for gaming journalists called GameJournoPros on the [[Breitbart News]] website. Yiannopoulos and Gamergate supporters saw the mailing list as evidence of collusion among journalists.&lt;ref name=GGJargon /&gt; The list's founder acknowledged suggesting that journalists write an open letter of support to Quinn in response to the harassment she was facing, but said other members of the list had rejected his suggestion and helped him understand why his idea was inappropriate.&lt;ref name=GJPresponse /&gt;&lt;ref name=FudgeResponse/&gt; Commentators did not consider the list to represent collusion, observing that it is a standard practice across professions to adopt informal venues for discussing matters of professional interest.&lt;ref name=westmanjournal/&gt; Following the leak, the mailing list was closed.&lt;ref name=FudgeResponse/&gt;

==Social and cultural implications==
Observers have generally described Gamergate as part of a long-running culture war against efforts to diversify the traditionally male video gaming community, particularly targeting outspoken women. They cite Gamergate supporters' frequent harassment of female figures in the gaming industry and its overt hostility toward people involved in social criticism and analysis of video games.&lt;ref name="Ip 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; ''The Washington Post''{{'}}s digital culture writer [[Caitlin Dewey]] said that "Whatever Gamergate may have started as, it is now an Internet culture war" between predominantly female game developers and critics advocating for greater inclusion, and "a motley alliance of vitriolic naysayers" opposed to such changes.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, quoted in {{harvp|Hanson|2017|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=Guide to Gamergate}} ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' said that Gamergate supporters were less interested in criticizing ethical issues than in opposition to social criticism and analysis of video games and in harassment of prominent women.&lt;ref name=VoxLose/&gt; ''Ars Technica'' quoted early members as saying that they had no interest in videogames and were primarily interested in attacking Quinn.&lt;ref name="Johnston September 2014"/&gt;

Gamergate has been described as being driven by antifeminist ideologies.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="right wing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bostonglobe 2015-06-12" /&gt; Some supporters have denied this, but acknowledge that there are misogynistic voices within Gamergate.&lt;ref name="Singal October 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Diver /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tsukayama /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vice /&gt; Antonsen, Ask, and Karlstrom wrote in ''Nordic Journal of Science and Technology Studies'' "in the case of #gamergate, it is the explicit goal of many of the participants to exclude groups of people, particularly women, from the debate and from the game industry and limit women's rights as citizens."&lt;ref name="nordic" /&gt; Jon Stone, in ''The Guardian'', called it a "swelling of vicious right-wing sentiment" and compared it to the [[men's rights movement]].&lt;ref name="right wing" /&gt; Commentators such as Stone, [[Liana Kerzner]], and Ryan Cooper have said that the controversy is being exploited by right-wing voices and by conservative pundits who had little interest in gaming.&lt;ref name="right wing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MetalEater2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan Cooper Week" /&gt; Chrisella Herzog states that in addition to violent sexism, Gamergate has virulent strains and violent sentiments of homophobia, transphobia, anti-Semitism, racism, and neo-Nazism.&lt;ref name="DipCour" /&gt; Some figures associated with Gamergate went on to become components of the so-called [[alt-right]], &lt;ref name="Alt-right Component" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein J"/&gt; which thus  featured in the [[2016 American presidential election]].&lt;ref name="Alt-right precursor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="From Video Games to Politics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Old Racism, New Technology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimesHollywoodGG" /&gt;

Quinn said the campaign had "roped well-meaning people who cared about ethics and transparency into a pre-existing hate mob",&lt;ref name="ViceQuinn" /&gt; and urged industry publishers and developers to condemn the hashtag.&lt;ref name="bbc gg condemned"/&gt; She further asked those Gamergate supporters who had any earnest discussion about ethics to move away from the "Gamergate" tag.&lt;ref name="bbc gg condemned"/&gt;

===Gamer identity===

Gamergate is often considered to be a reaction to the changing cultural identity of the "[[gamer]]". As video games grew in mainstream popularity during the 1990s, a "gamer" identity emerged around games marketed to an audience that was predominantly young, male and heterosexual. Over the years, the growing popularity of games expanded that audience to include many who did not fit the traditional gamer demographic, particularly women.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=42–43}} Games with artistic and cultural themes grew in popularity, and [[independent video game development]] made these games more common, while [[mobile games|mobile]] and [[casual games|casual]] games expanded the scope of the industry beyond the traditional gamer identity.{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}}&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes /&gt; The games most popular with typical "gamers", often featuring explicit violence along with exaggerated gender stereotypes, were joined by a more diverse set of games that included gay, lesbian, and transgender themes. "Indie" gaming blogs and websites were created to comment on these developments, in contrast to the more established gaming press, which was traditionally dependent on the games industry itself.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=42–43}}

The media-studies scholar Adrienne Massanari writes that Gamergate is a direct response to such changes in video-game content as well as changes in the demographics of players.{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}} Surveys by the [[Entertainment Software Association]] in 2014 and 2015 showed that video-game players were between 44% and 48% female,&lt;ref name="gamesindustry women" /&gt;{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}} with an average age of thirty-five.{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}} This broader audience began to question some assumptions and [[fantasy tropes and conventions|tropes]] that had been common in games. Shira Chess and Adrienne Shaw write that concern over these changes is integral to Gamergate, especially a fear that sexualized games aimed primarily at young men might eventually be replaced by less sexualized games marketed to broader audiences.&lt;ref name="Chess 2015" /&gt; Gamergaters often dismiss such games and their more diverse, casual group of players as being not "real" games or gamers.{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}} Alyssa Rosenberg of ''The Washington Post'' said that some of Gamergaters' concerns were rooted in a view of video games as "appliances" rather than art, that should be reviewed based on feature checklists rather than traditional artistic criteria.&lt;ref name=WaPoRosenberg /&gt; Chris Suellentrop of ''The New York Times'' criticized resistance to innovative uses of the gaming medium, and the belief that increased coverage and praise of artistic games like ''[[Gone Home]]'' would negatively affect blockbuster games such as ''Grand Theft Auto V''.&lt;ref name=NYTSuellentrop/&gt;

Gamergate is particularly associated with opposition to the influence of so-called "[[social justice warrior]]s" in the gaming industry and media, who are perceived as a threat to traditional gaming culture.{{sfnp|Massanari|2017|p=317}}{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}} As the video-game market grew more diverse, cultural critics became interested in issues of [[gender representation in video games|gender representation]] and identity in games.&lt;ref name=Vox /&gt;&lt;ref name=Time /&gt; One prominent feminist critic of the representation of women in gaming is Anita Sarkeesian,&lt;ref name="prominent 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prominent 2"/&gt; whose ''Tropes vs. Women in Video Games'' project is devoted to female stereotypes in games. Her fund-raising campaign and videos were met with hostility and harassment by some gamers. Further incidents raised concerns about [[sexism in video gaming]].&lt;ref name=Vox /&gt;&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;&lt;ref name=PolygonFBI /&gt; Prior to August 2014, escalating harassment prompted the [[International Game Developers Association]] (IGDA) to provide support groups for harassed developers and to begin discussions with the FBI to help investigate online harassment of game developers.&lt;ref name=PolygonFBI /&gt; In an interview on [[Comedy Central]]'s program ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', Sarkeesian said she believes women are targeted because they are "challenging the status quo of gaming as a male-dominated space".&lt;ref name=Colbert /&gt;

In late August 2014, shortly after the initial accusations against Grayson and harassment of Quinn, several gaming sites published opinion essays on the controversy that focused on the growing diversity of gaming and the mainstreaming of the medium, some of which included criticism of sexism within gamer culture.&lt;ref name="Plunkett" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston August 2014"/&gt; These so-called "gamers are dead" articles were seen as part of a conspiracy to undercut traditional gamer identity{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}}&lt;ref name="Chess 2015" /&gt; and were used by participants to rally support for Gamergate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}}; {{harvp|Shaw|Chess|2016|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'s'' [[David Auerbach]] and ''[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel's]]'' David Elks criticized these articles for alienating their publications' audience by attacking the gamer identity.&lt;ref name=stokesentinel/&gt; Writing for ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', L. Rhodes said the antagonism in the Gamergate controversy was a result of the industry seeking to widen its customer demographic instead of focusing on core gamers, which Rhodes says "is precisely what videogames needed".&lt;ref name="paste 2015-04-20" /&gt; Brendan Keogh of ''[[Overland (magazine)|Overland]]'' stated that Gamergate "does not represent a marginalised, discriminated identity under attack so much as a hegemonic and normative mainstream being forced to redistribute some of its power".&lt;ref name="overland"/&gt;

===Misogyny and sexism===

Gamergate has been described as an expression of sexism and misogyny within gaming culture; its main themes are criticism of feminism and so-called "social justice warriors", who are perceived as a threat to traditional video games.{{sfnp|Murray|2018|p=36}}{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=114}} Women's greater visibility in the gaming industry has seen a corresponding rise in gendered harassment and intimidation directed at them.{{refn|name=Salter}} Among mainstream journalists, the harassment campaign that became known as Gamergate is considered emblematic of this surge of online misogyny.{{sfnp|Nieborg|Foxman|2018|p=112}} According to Sarah Kaplan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "sexism in gaming is a long-documented, much-debated but seemingly intractable problem", and became the crux of the Gamergate controversy.&lt;ref name=WaPo /&gt; Jaime Weinman writing in ''[[Maclean's]]'' said, "[w]hether it was supposed to be or not, GamerGate is largely about women".&lt;ref name=Macleans /&gt; Discussing Gamergate on her [[ESPN]] blog, Jane McManus compared the misogyny that women in the gaming industry experience to that faced by the first women entering sporting communities.&lt;ref name="ESPNMcManus" /&gt; Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] has described Gamergate as "something that we need to stand clearly against".&lt;ref name="IBTimesTrudeauGG" /&gt;

Sexism and misogyny had been identified as problems in the video game industry and online community prior to the events of Gamergate.&lt;ref name="gdc misogyny 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe Women Outside" /&gt; Sarkeesian considered that the Internet has a "boys'-locker-room feel" to it, with male users trying to show off to each other which causes escalating cases of harassment in situations like Gamergate.&lt;ref name="guardian aug2015"/&gt; In March 2014, game designer [[Cliff Bleszinski]] wrote a blog post commenting on the "latent racism, homophobia and misogyny" that existed within the online gaming community.&lt;ref name="NYTSuellentrop"/&gt; In a November 2014 interview with ''[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]'', Wu said the game industry "has been a boys' club for 30 years", and that the common portrayal of women as "sex symbols and [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]" in video games has led to the players taking the same attitudes.&lt;ref name="develop harassment"/&gt; Brendan Sinclair, writing for ''[[GamesIndustry.biz]]'', stated that the events of the Gamergate controversy were "reprehensible and saddening" and "this industry has some profound issues in the way it treats women".&lt;ref name="gibiz silver lining"/&gt;

Many commentators have said that the harassment associated with Gamergate springs from this existing well of deep-seated misogyny, and that it was merely brought to the fore by the anonymity of the Internet. [[Lisa Nakamura]], a professor of digital studies at the University of Michigan, wrote that Gamergate "showed the world the extent of gaming's misogyny".&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, quoted in {{harvp|Murray|2018|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakamura"/&gt;  Regarding the false allegations against Quinn, [[Amanda Marcotte]] in an article for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' accused the video game world of being "thick with misogynists who are aching to swarm" with hate on any "random woman held up for them to hate, no matter what the pretext". She related these attacks to harassment sent to a woman who criticized a ''[[Teen Titans]]'' cover and to a community manager of the ''[[Mighty No. 9]]'' game because she drew a feminine [[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]], and virtual rapes committed against women's player avatars in ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' and ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]''.&lt;ref name="DBMarcotte" /&gt; In an interview with the BBC, Quinn stated that "[b]efore [Gamergate] had a name, it was nothing but trying to get me to kill myself, trying to get people to hurt me, going after my family.&amp;nbsp;[...] There is no mention of ethics in journalism at all outside of making the same accusation everybody makes towards any successful woman; that clearly she got to where she is because she had sex with someone."&lt;ref name="BBCQuinnInterview"/&gt; [[Danielle Citron]] of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] wrote that the intent of this type of harassment is to demean the victim, make them doubt their own integrity, and to redefine the victim's identity in order to "fundamentally distort who she is".&lt;ref name="inc"/&gt;

Targets of Gamergate supporters have overwhelmingly been women, even when men were responsible for the supposed wrongdoings. Writing in ''The New Yorker'', Simon Parkin observed that Quinn was attacked while the male journalist who was falsely accused of reviewing her work favorably largely escaped, revealing the campaign as "a pretense to make further harassment of women in the industry permissible".&lt;ref name="Parkin" /&gt; In ''The New York Times'', Chris Suellentrop said that a petition sought to have a female colleague fired for criticizing the portrayal of women in ''Grand Theft Auto V'', while he and many other male critics raised similar concerns but did not face similar reprisals.&lt;ref name=NYTSuellentrop /&gt; Most commentators have described Gamergate as consisting largely of white males, though some supporters have said that it includes a notable percentage of women, minorities and LGBT members.&lt;ref name="inquisitr" /&gt;

Critics of the movement have described it as a kind of misogynistic [[terrorism]].{{sfnp|Jane|2017|p=5}}{{refn|name=Musgrave}} Writing in ''The Week'', Ryan Cooper called the harassment campaign "an online form of terrorism" intended to reverse a trend in gaming culture toward increasing acceptance of women, and stated that social media platforms need to tighten their policies and protections against threats and abuse.&lt;ref name=TheWeek /&gt; Speaking on [[Iowa Public Radio]], academic Cindy Tekobbe said the harassment campaign was intended to drive women from public spaces and intimidate them into silence.&lt;ref name=IPR /&gt; Prof. Joanne St. Lewis of the [[University of Ottawa]] stated that Gamergate's harassment and threats should be considered acts of terrorism as the perpetrators seek to harm women and to prevent them from speaking back or defending others.&lt;ref name="vice 2015-02-13" /&gt;

===Law enforcement===

[[File:Katherine clark june 2014.jpg|thumb|left|[[Katherine Clark]], the U.S. Congresswoman from Massachusetts' 5th District, sought to expand the FBI's ability to take action against cyberharassment similar to that faced by Wu.]]

Though ''Newsweek'' reported that the FBI had a file regarding Gamergate, no arrests have been made nor charges filed,&lt;ref name="newsweek FBI" /&gt; and parts of the FBI investigation into the threats had been closed in September 2015 due to a lack of leads.&lt;ref name="verge fbi closed"/&gt; Former FBI supervisory special agent for cybercrimes, Tim Ryan, stated that cyberharassment cases are a low priority for authorities because it is difficult to track down the perpetrator and they have lower penalties compared to other crimes they are tasked to enforce.&lt;ref name="slate 2014-10-17" /&gt; In June 2015, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Elonis v. United States]]'' that harassing messages sent online are not necessarily [[true threat]]s that would be prosecutable under criminal law and, according to ''[[Pacific Standard]]'', this poses a further challenge in policing Gamergate-related harassment.&lt;ref name="psmag 2015-06-04" /&gt; However, the Court's decision also suggested that if threats made over social media were found to be true threats, they should be treated the same as threats made in other forms of communication.&lt;ref name="fastcompany 2015-06-02" /&gt;

Wu has expressed her frustration over how law enforcement agencies have responded to the threats that she and other women in the game industry have received.&lt;ref name="ars 2015-05-21" /&gt; On public release of the FBI's case files on Gamergate, Wu said she was "livid", and that "Only a fraction of information we gave the FBI was looked into. They failed on all levels."&lt;ref name="gamesindustyFBIGG" /&gt;The lack of legal enforcement contributes towards the harassers' ability to maintain these activities without any risk of punishment, according to Chrisella Herzog of ''[[The Diplomatic Courier]]''; at worst, harassers would see their social media accounts suspended but are able to turn around to register new accounts to continue to engage.&lt;ref name="DipCour"/&gt;

U.S. Representative [[Katherine Clark]], one of whose constituents was Brianna Wu, called for a stronger response from law enforcement to online abuse, partly as a result of advocacy by the women targeted by Gamergate.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=53–54}}&lt;ref name="Merlan"/&gt; On March 10, 2015, Clark wrote a letter to the [[House Appropriations Committee]] asking it to call on the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to crack down on the harassment of women on the internet, saying the campaign of intimidation associated with Gamergate had highlighted the problem.&lt;ref name="clark 2015-03-10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verge 2015-03-11" /&gt; She asked the U.S. Department of Justice to "prioritize" online threats against women, saying, "We do not think this a harmless hoax. We think this has real-life implications for women".&lt;ref name="Merlan"/&gt; Clark also hosted a Congressional briefing on March 15, along with the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus to review issues of cyberstalking and online threats; during the briefing, Quinn spoke of her experiences with Gamergate, which an executive director of the [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]] described during the hearing as "an online hate group&amp;nbsp;[...] which was started by an ex-boyfriend to ruin [Quinn's] life".&lt;ref name="polygon 2015-04-21" /&gt; On May 27, the [[United States House of Representatives]] formally supported Clark's request for increased measures to combat online abuse against women, explicitly pressing for more investigations and prosecutions by the Department of Justice.&lt;ref name="wgbh 2015-06-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon 2015-05-29" /&gt; On June 2, Rep. Clark introduced the "Prioritizing Online Threat Enforcement Act of 2015" to Congress. The bill would have allocated more funding for the FBI to employ additional agents to enforce laws against [[cyberstalking]], online criminal harassment, and threats.&lt;ref name="metrowest 2015-06-04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.2602" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo 2015-06-07" /&gt; Two years later, in June 2017, Rep. Clark introduced the "Online Safety Modernization Act of 2017" with co-sponsors Reps. [[Susan Brooks]] (Indiana) and [[Pat Meehan]] (Pennsylvania), which combined several of Clark's previous bills. The bill focused on penalizing "cybercrimes against individuals", including doxing, swatting, and [[sextortion]], as well as granting $20 million for law enforcement training to help tackle such crimes, and $4 million to establish the National Resource Center on Cybercrimes Against Individuals in order to study and collect statistics and information related to these crimes.&lt;ref name="verge 2017-06-29"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clark hr__2017"/&gt;

==Gaming industry response==

The harassment of Quinn, Sarkeesian, Wu, and others led prominent industry professionals to condemn the Gamergate attacks for damaging the video gaming community and the public perception of the industry.&lt;ref name="Straumsheim2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newsweek 2015-05-31" /&gt; ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''{{'}}s Laura Parker stated that the Gamergate situation led those outside of the video game industry to be "flooded with evidence of the video-game community as a poisonous and unwelcoming place", furthering any negative views they may have had of video games.&lt;ref name="vanityfair 2015-08-04" /&gt; Independent game developer Andreas Zecher wrote an open letter calling upon the community to take a stand against the attacks, attracting the signatures of more than two thousand professionals within the gaming industry.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes /&gt; Many in the industry saw the signatures "as proof that the people sending vicious attacks at Quinn and Sarkeesian weren't representative of the video game industry overall".&lt;ref name=NPR /&gt; Writing for ''The Guardian'', Jenn Frank described the tactics used in the harassment campaign and the [[climate of fear]] it generated through its attacks on women and their allies, concluding that this alienating and abusive environment would harm not only women but also the industry as a whole.&lt;ref name=GuardianJF /&gt; Frank herself received significant harassment for writing this article, and announced an intention to quit games journalism as a result.&lt;ref name=Vox /&gt; Games designer Damion Schubert wrote that Gamergate was "an unprecedented {{sic|catastrof**k}}", and that silencing critiques of games harms games developers by depriving them of feedback.&lt;ref name="EscapistSchubertInterview"/&gt; Several video game developers, journalists, and gamers from across various gender, racial, and social backgrounds adopted new Twitter hashtags, such as #INeedDiverseGames, #StopGamergate2014 and #GamersAgainstGamergate, to show solidarity with the people targeted by the harassment and their opposition to the reactionary messages from Gamergate supporters.&lt;ref name="salon 2014-12-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans, Janish 2015" /&gt;

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] characterized Gamergate as a "magnet for harassment", and notes the possible financial risk for companies dealing with it on social media platforms.&lt;ref name="eff 2015-01-08" /&gt; The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) issued a statement condemning the harassment, stating that "[t]here is no place in the video game community—or our society—for personal attacks and threats".&lt;ref name="wapost esa" /&gt; ESA president Mike Gallagher, speaking at the June 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo, clarified that the ESA did not become more involved as they felt it was an argument that was outside their industry and their involvement would have been disruptive, but praised the efforts to counter harassment that will benefit the industry in the future.&lt;ref name="gamasutra 2015-06-14" /&gt; At [[BlizzCon]] 2014, [[Blizzard Entertainment]] president and co-founder [[Mike Morhaime]] denounced recent harassment; blaming a "small group of people [who] have been doing really awful things" and "tarnishing our reputation" as gamers. He called on attendees to treat each other with kindness and demonstrate to the world that the community rejects harassment. His statements were widely interpreted as referring to Gamergate.&lt;ref name=CNet /&gt;&lt;ref name=joystiqblizzcon /&gt;&lt;ref name=PCGamerMM /&gt; CEOs of both the American and European branches of [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], [[Shawn Layden]] and Jim Ryan respectively, said the harassment and bullying were absolutely horrific and that such inappropriate behavior would not be tolerated at Sony.&lt;ref name="ibtimes 2015-02-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sony response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="venture sony" /&gt; The Swedish Games Industry issued a statement denouncing the harassment and sexism from Gamergate supporters.&lt;ref name="GuardianQvist" /&gt;

Responses to Gamergate have encouraged the video game industry to review its treatment of women and minorities, and to make changes to support them.&lt;ref name="wapo 3 women" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate GG2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nightline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fortune august2015"/&gt; Intel, following its accidental involvement in Gamergate, pledged more than $300 million to help support a "Diversity in Technology" program with partners including Sarkeesian's Feminist Frequency organization and the IGDA, aimed at increasing the number of women and minorities in the industry. Intel CEO [[Brian Krzanich]] stated in announcing the program that "it's not good enough to say we value diversity, and then have our industry not fully represent".&lt;ref name="Polygon Intel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes Intel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired 2015-01-07" /&gt; [[Electronic Arts]] (EA) COO [[Peter Moore (businessman)|Peter Moore]] said the controversy made EA pay more attention to diversity and inclusion, telling ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' "[i]f there's been any benefit to Gamergate,&amp;nbsp;[...] I think it just makes us think twice at times".&lt;ref name="fortune 2015-09-04" /&gt; Speaking about Gamergate harassment to the ''[[Seattle Times]]'', [[IGDA]] executive director Kate Edwards said, "Gaming culture has been pretty misogynistic for a long time now. There's ample evidence of that over and over again... What we're finally seeing is that it became so egregious that now companies are starting to wake up and say, "We need to stop this. This has got to change."&lt;ref name="seattletimes"/&gt;

The [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] 2015 included markedly more female protagonists in these new games, as well as more visible presence by women at the event. Some commentators characterized this as a response to Gamergate and a rejection of the misogynistic Gamergate harassment.&lt;ref name="RepresentationStrides" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GamergateFail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BadassCharacters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IBTBatman" /&gt;

The game ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'' references Gamergate with hashtag, #CrusaderGate, which the [[Riddler]] uses to unsuccessfully try to rally the Internet against Batman; bemoaning its failure, the Riddler describes those who use the hashtag as "idiotic and easily roused rabble".&lt;ref name="ArkhamKnightPolygon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IBTBatman" /&gt;

==Gamergate representation in media==
"[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 16)#Episodes|Intimidation Game]]", an episode of the crime television series ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', portrays a fictionalized version of the Gamergate controversy, including a character whom some observers said resembled Sarkeesian and whose story seemed based on those of women subject to the harassment campaign.&lt;ref name="ars 2015-02-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost 2015-02-12" /&gt; The 2015 documentary film ''[[GTFO (film)|GTFO]]'' analyzed issues of sexism and harassment in video gaming. The film's director, Shannon Sun-Higginson, stated Gamergate was "a terrible, terrible thing, but it's actually symptomatic of a wider, cultural, systemic problem".&lt;ref name="nytimes 2015-03-08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes 2015-03-13" /&gt; The Gamergate situation was covered as part of a larger topic of online harassment of women in the June 21, 2015, episode of ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]''.&lt;ref name="time 2015-06-22" /&gt; The impact of the Gamergate controversy on Brianna Wu was the subject of the March 16, 2016, episode of ''[[The Internet Ruined My Life]]''.&lt;ref name="cnnmoney 2016-03-16" /&gt;

==Reducing online harassment==

In January 2015, Quinn and Alex Lifschitz created the [[Crash Override Network]], a private group of experts who provide free support and counsel to those that have been harassed online, including as a result of Gamergate, and to work with law authorities and social media sites in response to such threats.&lt;ref name="CSM 2015-01-20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Verge 2015-01-17" /&gt; Software developer Randi Harper founded a similar group, the [[Online Abuse Prevention Initiative]], a non-profit organization that also seeks to provide aid to those harassed online.&lt;ref name="guardian 2016-04-13" /&gt;

Anita Sarkeesian was named as one of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet in March 2015, and later in the magazine's Top 100 Most Influential People of 2015, in recognition of her role in highlighting sexism in the video game community in the wake of the Gamergate controversy.{{sfnp|Salter|2017|pp=53–54}}&lt;ref name="time 2015-03-05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time 2015-04-16" /&gt; She was also highlighted as one of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''{{'}}s fifty "Internet's Most Fascinating" in a 2015 list due to her efforts to curb online harassment.&lt;ref name="cosmo"/&gt;

An on-line abuse panel (itself the subject of controversy) at the 2016 [[SXSW]] festival said that there was no technological solution to the problem of harassment given human nature;&lt;ref name="SXSW On-Line Harassment Panel" /&gt; although policy changes have been made, the larger issue is more societal than platform-specific.&lt;ref name="engadetSXSWSummit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RecodeSXSWSummit" /&gt; Referring to the discussion at SXSW in a speech for [[Women's History Month]], [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] said that "We know that women gamers face harassment and stalking and threats of violence from other players. When they speak out about their experiences, they're attacked on Twitter and other social media outlets, even threatened in their homes."&lt;ref name="obama" /&gt; Obama urged targets of harassment to speak out, praising the courage of those who had resisted online harassment. "And what's brought these issues to light is that there are a lot of women out there, especially young women, who are speaking out bravely about their experiences, even when they know they'll be attacked for it".&lt;ref name="obama"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailydot 2016-03-18"/&gt;

[[File:Glimmerglass Opera.JPG|thumb|300px|Alice Busch Opera Theater]]
The '''Glimmerglass Festival''' (formerly known as '''Glimmerglass Opera''') is an [[opera]] company which was founded in 1975 by Peter Macris and presents an annual season of operas at the '''Alice Busch Opera Theater''' on [[Otsego Lake (New York)|Otsego Lake]] eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Cooperstown, New York]], [[United States]].

The summer-only season usually consists of four productions performed in rotating repertory. Glimmerglass is well known for producing new, lesser-known, and rare works, many of which in years past have been co-produced with the [[New York City Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=At City Opera, an Innovator Bows Out|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/arts/music/06tomm.html|work=The New York Times|date=2007-05-06|first=Anthony|last=Tommasini|authorlink=Anthony Tommasini}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second-largest summer opera festival in the United States, led by Artistic and General Director [[Francesca Zambello]].

==History==
Until 2011, the company operated under the name Glimmerglass Opera. The company presented its first season in the summer of 1975, when four performances of ''[[La bohème]]'' were staged in the auditorium of the Cooperstown High School. In the years since, it has grown considerably and now offers more than 40 performances of four operas, nearly always in new productions, each summer.

Operas have been performed in repertory since 1990. For the first seventeen seasons, all operas were sung in English; since 1992 they have, with some exceptions, been performed in their original language with [[Surtitles|projected titles]] in English.

Several works have had their American or world premieres at Glimmerglass; the 1999 season featured the world premiere of ''Central Park'', three one-act operas performed as a single work. The triptych was jointly commissioned by Glimmerglass Opera, New York City Opera, and Thirteen/[[WNET]]'s ''[[Great Performances]]'', which telecast it on [[PBS]] in January 2000. The telecast was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]].

Paul Kellogg was the General Director of Glimmerglass Opera from 1979 to 1996 and the Artistic Director from 1996 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City Opera Appoints a Director|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/12/arts/city-opera-appoints-a-director.html|work=The New York Times|date=1996-01-12|first=Allan|last=Kozinn|authorlink=Allan Kozinn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Paul Kellogg to Retire From New York City Opera and Glimmerglass Posts| url=http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/2869.html | work=Playbill Arts | date=2005-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart Robertson was music director of Glimmerglass Opera from 1988 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Glimmerglass Opera Music Director to Step Down | url=http://www.andante.com/article/article.cfm?id=26244 | agency=Associated Press | date=2005-12-02 | accessdate=2008-10-22 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081116111845/http://www.andante.com/article/article.cfm?id=26244 | archivedate=2008-11-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, Glimmerglass Opera announced the appointment of David Angus as the company's next music director, starting in the summer of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.glimmerglass.org/PDF/Press%209.1/GGO%20Announces%20Music%20Director.pdf | title=Glimmerglass Opera Appoints Music Director | publisher=Glimmerglass Opera | date=20 October 2008 | accessdate=2008-10-22 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923105652/http://glimmerglass.org/PDF/Press%209.1/GGO%20Announces%20Music%20Director.pdf | archivedate=23 September 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francesca Zambello]] became artistic and general director of the newly renamed Glimmerglass Festival in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2011/5/Features/The_Company_She_Keeps.html|title=The Company She Keeps|date=May 2011|volume=75|number=11|work=[[Opera News]]|author=David Belcher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Citation needed span|date=January 2015|text=The Young American Artists Program, established in 1988, brings singers in the first stages of their professional careers to study and perform at Glimmerglass. These young artists are chosen annually from hundreds of applicants from throughout the United States. In addition to rehearsing and performing, Young Artists receive musical coaching, attend classes in diction and acting, and are given instruction in such non-performing skills as audition techniques, role preparation, and the business aspects of managing a career. Administrators from many of the world's leading opera houses visit Glimmerglass throughout the summer and hear the Young Artists in performance. In the course of the summer each Young Artist gives a solo song recital at venues in Cooperstown and nearby Cherry Valley, a feature of the Glimmerglass season that has become extremely popular with opera patrons and the local community.}}

==Alice Busch Opera Theater==
The Glimmerglass Festival's Alice Busch Opera Theater, which opened in June 1987, was built on {{convert|43|acre|0}} of farmland donated by Tom Goodyear, its first chairman. The 914-seat theater&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALICE BUSCH OPERA THEATER|url=http://glimmerglass.org/your-visit/glimmerglass/allice-busch-opera-theater/|website=The Glimmerglass Festival|publisher=The Glimmerglass Festival|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is notable for its pastoral setting, for being the first American opera house built since 1966, and for its sliding walls, closed only while singers are on-stage and in foul weather. The Theater was designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates. 

The new theater was built to move the performances from a high school auditorium with poor acoustics and sight lines and no orchestra pit to a building with an interior designed specifically for opera performances. The exterior design was inspired by local farm buildings to fit with the surrounding landscape and to promote a less formal and more relaxed atmosphere suitable for a summer theater. For environmental and cost efficiencies, the building was designed to use only natural ventilation, without any mechanical heating or cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theater of Architecture|last = Hardy|first = Hugh|publisher = Princeton Architectural Press|year = 2013|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 185–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Open-air opera|last = Anderson|first = Grace|date = 1988|journal = Architectural Record|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 90–93|issue = August}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent festival seasons==
The Festival's 2010 season featured four new productions, including Copland's ''[[The Tender Land]]'', and Handel's ''[[Tolomeo]]''. During the 2011 season [[Luigi Cherubini|Cherubini]]'s ''[[Médée (Cherubini)|Médée]]'' was presented. Also, a double bill featuring the world premiere of ''A Blizzard on Marblehead Neck'', with music by [[Jeanine Tesori]] set to [[Tony Kushner]]'s libretto (a story inspired by the life of [[Eugene O'Neill]]) along with ''Later the Same Evening'', a one-act opera based on characters in five of [[Edward Hopper]]'s paintings with a score by [[John Musto]] from a libretto by Mark Campbell.

In 2012, the festival featured Verdi's ''[[Aida]]'', Lully's ''[[Armide (Lully)|Armide]]'', Kurt Weill's ''[[Lost in the Stars]]'' and the musical ''[[The Music Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.glimmerglass.org/press/news-releases/current/the-glimmerglass-festival-announces-2012-season/| title=The Glimmerglass Festival Announces 2012 Season| publisher=Glimmerglass Opera| date=14 June 2011| accessdate=2011-06-14| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018175559/http://www.glimmerglass.org/press/news-releases/current/the-glimmerglass-festival-announces-2012-season/| archivedate=18 October 2011| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Armide'' was presented in collaboration with [[Opera Atelier]] of Toronto, Canada, and ''Lost in the Stars'' presented in collaboration with [[Cape Town Opera]] of South Africa.

{{third-party|date=February 2014}}
The '''Greek Picnic''' is an annual week-long event during the month of July in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Originally designed as a reunion celebrating [[African American]] [[college]] [[fraternities]] and [[sororities]], it later gained popularity among a large population that do not attend college due to its various popular [[social]] activities. "Sister" events also include the Greek Festival in [[Hampton, Virginia]]; [[The Atlanta Greek Picnic]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]; The [[Charlotte Greek Picnic]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]; the [[Texas Greek Picnic]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], [[Nashville Greek Picnic]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], the California Greek Picnic in [[Los Angeles, California]] and [[Bikers Week]] in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]].

==History==
The Philadelphia Greek Picnic celebrated its 31st year on July 9, 2005 at the Belmont Grove in [[Fairmount Park]]. The Philadelphia Greek Picnic continues to be the nation’s oldest reunion for members of the historic nine African-American fraternities and sororities and people who appreciate and understand college and African American Greek-lettered life.

The Philadelphia Greek Picnic is co-sponsored by the City of Philadelphia, the Office of the Managing Director, the Fairmount Park Commission, the [[Philadelphia Police Department]] and the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] Inc. of Philadelphia. It is managed and coordinated by volunteers of the nine organizations wishing to make the entire week-long experience unforgettable based upon the themes of
Scholarship, Fellowship and Respect.

==Popularity==
During the early to mid 1990s the picnic grew national notoriety, attracting college students and party-goers from all over the east coast of the [[United States]]. The primary festival held in Fairmount Park frequently registered an attendance of 100,000+ people, with another 100,000-200,000 people scattered across the city in support of the events. Also various [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[R&amp;B]] celebrities can be seen attending the events.

During the week the city receives a large economic boost due to [[tourism]]. Hotel and rental-car companies throughout Philadelphia, [[South Jersey]], and [[Delaware]] are reserved weeks to months in advance and opportunities for [[price gouging]] as the event grows closer are prevalent.

In recent years, the event has grown smaller, quieter and less troublesome to the police as well as attendants due to restructuring by the event organizers.

==Detractions==
From the mid to late 1990s the Greek Picnic regressed into an event spoiled by frequent cases of assault, [[gun]]-related violence, [[car-jacking]], [[sexual harassment]], [[sexual assault]], and other crimes that seem to only happen at this specific event as opposed to other large gatherings within the city of Philadelphia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Also during the event, [[traffic]] in the Philadelphia Area, particularly in [[West Philadelphia]] and [[South Street (Philadelphia)|South Street]] is at its most congested level for the year.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The Philadelphia Police department often requires significant [[overtime]] of its officers for traffic control as well as crime deterrence.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Events==
The usual events during the week of the Greek Picnic are as follows:

*Day 0 Saturday- Books and [[Basketball]] Tournament, Acres of Diamonds
*Day 1 Sunday- NPHC Worship Service, Cultural [[The arts|Arts]] Night
*Day 3 Tuesday- Cultural Arts Night
*Day 4 Wednesday- Stop the [[Violence]] Urban [[Dance]] Competition
*Day 5 Thursday- Comedy Show
*Day 6 Friday- President’s Reception
*Day 7 Saturday- Stompfest Online’s National Stepshow, Fairmount Park Festival
*Day 8 Sunday- Hair and Fashion Showcase

'''HMCS ''Toronto'' (FFH 333)''' is a {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|1}} that has served in the [[Canadian Forces]] since 1993. ''Toronto'' is the fourth ship in her class which is the name for the [[Canadian Patrol Frigate Project]]. She is the second vessel (and frigate) to carry the designation {{HMCS|Toronto}}. When not on operations she is assigned to [[Maritime Forces Atlantic]] (MARLANT) and is based at [[CFB Halifax]]. ''Toronto'' serves on MARLANT missions protecting Canada's sovereignty in the Atlantic Ocean and enforcing Canadian laws in its territorial sea and [[exclusive economic zone]].

==Description and design==
The ''Halifax''-class frigate design of which ''Toronto'' belongs, was ordered by the [[Canadian Forces]] in 1977 as a replacement for the aging {{sclass-|St. Laurent|destroyer|5}}, {{sclass-|Restigouche|destroyer|5}}, {{sclass-|Mackenzie|destroyer|5}}, and {{sclass-|Annapolis|destroyer|4}}es of [[destroyer escort]]s , which were all tasked with [[anti-submarine warfare]].&lt;ref name=milner284&gt;Milner, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1983, the federal government approved the budget for the design and construction of the first batch of six new frigates of which ''Toronto'' was a part, out of twelve that were eventually built.&lt;ref name=mac291&gt;Macpherson and Barrie, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; To reflect the changing long term strategy of the Navy during the 1980s and 1990s, the ''Halifax''-class frigates was designed as a general purpose warship with particular focus on anti-submarine capabilities.&lt;ref name=milner284/&gt;

As built, the ''Halifax''-class vessels [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|4750|LT|t}} and were {{convert|441|ft|9|in|m|order=flip}} [[Length overall|long overall]] and {{convert|408|ft|5|in|m|order=flip}} [[Length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]] with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|53|ft|8|in|m|order=flip}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|16|ft|4|in|m|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name=mac291/&gt;&lt;ref name=saunders90&gt;Saunders, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; That made them slightly larger than the ''Iroquois''-class destroyers.&lt;ref name=mac291/&gt; The vessels are propelled by two shafts with Escher Wyss controllable pitch [[propeller]]s driven by a [[CODOG]] system of two [[General Electric LM2500]] gas turbines, generating {{convert|47,500|shp|kW|lk=in}} and one [[SEMT Pielstick]] 20 PA6 V 280 [[diesel engine]], generating {{convert|8,800|shp|kW}}.&lt;ref name=saunders90/&gt; 

This gives the frigates a maximum speed of {{convert|29|kn|lk=in}} and a range of {{convert|7000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}} while using their diesel engines.&lt;ref name=mac291/&gt;&lt;ref name=saunders90/&gt; Using their gas turbines, the ships have a range of {{convert|3930|nmi}} at {{convert|18|kn}}. The ''Halifax'' class have a complement of 198 naval personnel of which 17 are officers and 17 aircrew of which 8 are officers.&lt;ref name=saunders90/&gt;

===Armament and aircraft===
As built the ''Halifax''-class vessels deployed the [[CH-124 Sea King]] helicopter, which acted in concert with shipboard sensors to seek out and destroy submarines at long distances from the ships. The ships have a helicopter deck fitted with a "[[Beartrap (helicopter device)|bear trap]]" system allowing the launch and recovery of helicopters in up to [[Sea State|sea state 6]]. The ''Halifax'' class also carries a close-in anti-submarine weapon in the form of the [[Mark 46 torpedo]], launched from twin Mark 32 Mod 9 torpedo tubes in launcher compartments either side of the forward end of the helicopter hangar.&lt;ref name=saunders90/&gt;

As built, the anti-shipping role is supported by the [[RGM-84 Harpoon]] Block 1C [[surface-to-surface missile]], mounted in two quadruple launch tubes at the main deck level between the funnel and the helicopter hangar.&lt;ref name=mac291/&gt;&lt;ref name=saunders90/&gt; For [[anti-aircraft]] self-defence the ships are armed with the [[Sea Sparrow]] [[Vertical Launching System|vertical launch]] [[surface-to-air missile]] in two Mk 48 Mod 0 eight-cell launchers placed to port and starboard of the funnel. The vessels carry 16 missiles.&lt;ref name=saunders90/&gt; A [[Raytheon]]/[[General Dynamics]] [[Phalanx CIWS|Phalanx]] Mark 15 Mod 21 Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) is mounted on top of the helicopter hangar for "last-ditch" defence against targets that evade the Sea Sparrow.&lt;ref name=saunders90/&gt;

As built, the main gun on the [[forecastle]] is a [[Bofors 57 mm L/70 naval artillery gun|{{convert|57|mm|in|abbr=on|1}}/70 calibre Mark 2 gun]] from [[Bofors]].{{efn|name=gun nomenclature}} The gun is capable of firing {{convert|2.4|kg|adj=on}} shells at a rate of 220 rounds per minute at a range of more than {{convert|17|km}}.&lt;ref name=saunders90/&gt;

===Countermeasures and sensors===
As built, the decoy system comprises Two [[BAE Systems]] Shield Mark 2 decoy launchers which fire [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]] to {{convert|2|km}} and infrared rockets to {{convert|169|m|yd}} in distraction, confusion and centroid seduction modes. The torpedo decoy is the [[SLQ-25 Nixie|AN/SLQ-25A Nixie]] towed acoustic decoy from Argon ST. The ship's radar warning receiver, the CANEWS (Canadian Electronic Warfare System), SLQ-501, and the radar jammer, SLQ-505, were developed by Thorn and Lockheed Martin Canada.&lt;ref name=saunders90/&gt;

Two [[Thales Nederland]] (formerly Signaal) SPG-503 (STIR 1.8) fire control radars are installed one on the roof of the bridge and one on the raised radar platform immediately forward of the helicopter hangar. The ship is also fitted with Raytheon [[AN/SPS-49]](V)5 long-range active air search radar operating at C and D bands, Ericsson HC150 Sea Giraffe medium-range air and surface search radar operating at G and H bands, and Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 I-band navigation radar. The sonar suite includes the CANTASS Canadian Towed Array and GD-C AN/SQS-510 hull mounted sonar and incorporates an acoustic range prediction system. The sonobuoy processing system is the GD-C AN/UYS-503.&lt;ref name=saunders90/&gt;

===Modernization===
The ''Halifax'' class underwent a modernization program, known as the Halifax Class Modernization (HCM) program, in order to update the frigates' capabilities in combatting modern smaller, faster and more mobile threats. This involved upgrading the command and control, radar, communications, electronic warfare and armament systems. Further improvements, such as modifying the vessel to accommodate the new [[Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone]] helicopter and satellite links will be done separately from the main Frigate Equipment Life Extension (FELEX) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/business-equipment/halifax-frigate.page |title=Halifax-class Modernization / Frigate Life Extension |publisher=National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217141250/http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/business-equipment/halifax-frigate.page |archivedate=17 February 2018 |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FELEX program comprised upgrading the combat systems integration to CMS330. The SPS-49 2D long-range air search radar was replaced by the [[Thales Nederland]] SMART-S Mk&amp;nbsp;2 E/F-band 3D surveillance radar, and the two STIR 1.8 fire-control radars were replaced by a pair of Saab Ceros 200 recontrol radars. A Telephonics IFF Mode 5/S interrogator was installed and the Elisra NS9003A-V2HC ESM system replaced the SLQ-501 CANEWS. An IBM multi-link (Link 11, Link 16 and Link 22 enabled) datalink processing system was installed along with two [[Raytheon]] Anschütz Pathfinder Mk II navigation radars. Furthermore, [[Rheinmetall]]'s [[Multi Ammunition Softkill System]] (MASS), known as MASS DUERAS, was introduced to replace the Plessey Shield decoy system. The existing 57&amp;nbsp;mm Mk&amp;nbsp;2 guns were upgraded to the Mk&amp;nbsp;3 standard, the Harpoon missiles were improved to Block II levels, the Phalanx was upgraded to Block 1B, and the obsolete Sea Sparrow system was replaced by the [[Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.janes.com/article/60726/halifax-class-upgrade-on-finals-cansec2016d2 |title=Halifax class upgrade on finals [CANSEC2016D2] |last=Scott |first=Richard |website=janes.com |date=26 May 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217141122/http://www.janes.com/article/60726/halifax-class-upgrade-on-finals-cansec2016d2 |archivedate=17 February 2018 |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==
''Toronto'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 22 April 1989 by [[Saint John Shipbuilding|Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd.]] at [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 18 December 1990. The frigate was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the Canadian Forces on 29 July 1993 at [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] and carries the [[hull classification symbol (Canada)|hull classification symbol]] FFH 333.&lt;ref name=mac295&gt;Macpherson and Barrie, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, ''Toronto'' deployed to the Adriatic Sea in support of the [[NATO]] blockade of [[Yugoslavia]]. In 1995, with {{HMCS|Halifax|FFH 330|2}} and {{HMCS|Terra Nova|DDE 259|2}}, ''Toronto'' sailed to Europe making a series of port visits in commemoration of the end of the [[Second World War]] in Europe. The same year, the ship took part in the NATO naval exercise Linked Seas off Portugal. In 1996, ''Toronto'' sailed through the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] and the [[Great Lakes]] making several port visits.&lt;ref name=mac295/&gt; 

In 1998, ''Toronto'' joined the NATO fleet [[STANAVFORLANT]] in January. On 10 February, the ship was redeployed to the [[Persian Gulf]] to assist in the enforcement of sanctions against Iraq.&lt;ref name=mac295/&gt; During the ship's deployment, the frigate served with a [[United States Navy]] fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milner, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; The ship returned to Canada on 16 June. On 5 December, ''Toronto'' sailed to the [[Middle East]] as part of [[Operation Apollo]] in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-2014)|War in Afghanistan]]. The ship returned to Canada on 27 May 2002.&lt;ref name=mac295/&gt; From January to July 2004, ''Toronto'' took part in Operation Altair, operating with the {{USS|George Washington|CVN-73|6}} Carrier Strike Group as part of a U.S.-led coalition in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. In summer 2005, ''Toronto'' performed another tour of the Great Lakes.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2005, ''Toronto'', with {{HMCS|Athabaskan|DDG 282|2}}, {{HMCS|St. John's|FFH 340|2}} and the [[Canadian Coast Guard]] vessel {{ship|CCGS|Sir William Alexander||2}}, were dispatched to the Gulf of Mexico to aid the United States in their response to the flooding of [[New Orleans]] by [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, ''Toronto'' with {{HMCS|Shawinigan|MM 704|2}} and the Canadian Coast Guard vessel {{ship|CCGS|Pierre Radisson||2}} made an Arctic patrol through [[Frobisher Bay]] as part of [[Operation Nanook (2009)|Operation Nanook]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''Toronto'' deployed to the [[Caribbean Sea]] to perform drug-smuggling interdiction duties as part of [[Operation Caribbe]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; The ship returned to the Caribbean in 2011 as part of Operation Caribbe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/operations-canada-north-america-recurring/op-caribbe.page |title=Operation Caribbe |publisher=National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217154540/http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/operations-canada-north-america-recurring/op-caribbe.page |archivedate=17 February 2018 |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Toronto'' participated in Operation Artemis, commencing her first rotation (ROTO 2) in January 2013 and finishing in February 2014 (which included a crew swap in July 2013 [the first crew swap in RCN history since 1991]).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

While relieving {{HMCS|Regina|FFH 334|2}} in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as part of [[Standing NATO Maritime Group 2]], ''Toronto'' was reassigned to the [[Black Sea]] for Operation Reassurance in response to Russian intervention in Central and Eastern Europe. ''Toronto'' led Task Unit 2 (TU.02) and worked in concert with [[Spanish Navy]] frigate {{ship|Spanish frigate|Almirante Juan de Borbón|F102|2}}, and operated with [[Romanian Naval Forces|Romanian Navy]] frigate ''[[HMS Coventry (F98)|Regele Ferdinand]]'' and United States Navy destroyer {{USS|Ross|DDG-71|6}} as well as other vessels from Bulgaria, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], Turkey, and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy-marine.forces.gc.ca/en/news-operations/news-view.page?doc=hmcs-toronto-will-operate-in-the-black-sea-during-operation-reassurance/hyyl414u |title=HMCS Toronto will operate in the Black Sea during Operation Reassurance |work=Royal Canadian Navy |publisher=Government of Canada |date=5 September 2014 |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September 2014, ''Toronto'' was circled by two Russian [[Su-24]] attack aircraft and a Russian surveillance plane in a provocative manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/russian-military-plane-circles-hmcs-toronto-in-black-sea-1.2759843 |title=Russian military planes buzzed HMCS Toronto in Black Sea |work=CBC News |date=8 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217155109/http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/russian-military-planes-buzzed-hmcs-toronto-in-black-sea-1.2759843 |archivedate=17 February 2018 |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, six members of the crew helped fight a fire while on shore leave in Antalya, Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/11/16/hmcs-toronto-crew-members-put-out-fire-in-turkey-after-spotting-burning-building-while-dining-on-shore/ |title=HMCS Toronto crew members put out fire in Turkey after spotting burning building while dining on shore |work=National Post |date=16 November 2014 |accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the Mediterranean Sea, ''Toronto'' suffered a fire in its auxiliary machinery room on 25 December 2014.

''Toronto'' was the last ship of the class to complete her FELEX refit, which was performed at Irving Shipyards in Halifax. The vessel was returned to the Royal Canadian Navy on 29 November 2016 to begin sea trials. The vessel was not expected to be operational until 2017–18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1419770-irving-finishes-frigate-refits-for-navy |title=Irving finishes frigate refits for navy |last=Gunn |first=Andrea |newspaper=The Chronicle Herald |date=28 November 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217154306/http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1419770-irving-finishes-frigate-refits-for-navy |archivedate=17 February 2018 |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, ''Toronto'' trained with the new Resolve-class auxiliary vessel, {{MV|Asterix}} off the coast of Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/asterix-refuels-royal-canadian-navy-frigate-for-the-first-time |title=Asterix refuels Royal Canadian Navy frigate for the first time |work=Ottawa Citizen |last=Pugliese |first=David |date=16 January 2018 |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, ''Toronto'' was deployed to European waters. During a series of exercises in UK waters, the frigate developed a significant electrical problem that caused a loss of power to the ship.

'''''Hillsborough''''' is a [[television film]] written by [[Jimmy McGovern]] and starring [[Christopher Eccleston]] and [[Ricky Tomlinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jun/10/features.features11|title=The power of truth|last=McGovern|first=Jimmy|date=2004-06-10|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set between 1989 and 1991, the film is a dramatization of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], which saw 96 football supporters lose their lives at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] in [[Sheffield]].

==Background==
In April 1989, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] met in the semi-finals of the [[1988&amp;ndash;89 FA Cup|FA Cup]]. The match was played at [[Hillsborough Stadium]] in [[Sheffield]] but was abandoned shortly after the match had started when it became clear that the fans packed in to the [[Leppings Lane]] end of the ground were being crushed against fencing. 94 fans died that day, with a 95th victim dying a few days later, and the final death toll reaching 96 in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/world/europe/uk-hillsborough-soccer-stadium-charges.html|title=Six Are Charged in 1989 Hillsborough Stadium Disaster in England|last=Bilefsky|first=Dan|date=2017-06-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
In 1995, two women who had lost children in the disaster asked McGovern if he would write their story. He began by interviewing the families of the victims, and became so angry at the unfolding story that he brought in writer Katy Jones to verify that his writing was not skewed in any way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jun/10/features.features11|title=The power of truth|last=McGovern|first=Jimmy|date=2004-06-10|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jive Suvorovs Bazokina 9348.JPG|thumb|Austrian Open Championships Vienna, 2012 WDSF World Dancesport Championships Latin 16.-18. November 2012 ]]
[[File:New Style Dancing Arrives- the Introduction of the Jive Into British Dance Halls, 1945 D23830.jpg|thumb|Jiving in a British dance hall, 1945]]
In [[latin dancing]], the '''jive''' is a [[dance]] style that originated in the United States from [[African-American]]s in the early 1930s. It was popularized in 1934 by [[Cab Calloway]]. It is a lively and uninhibited variation of the [[Jitterbug]], a form of [[Swing dance]]. [[Glenn Miller]] introduced his own jive dance in 1938 with the song "Doin' the Jive" which never caught on.

==Overview==
The hand jive is one of the five [[Ballroom dancing|International Latin]] dances. In competition it is danced at a speed of 176 [[Tempo|beats per minute]], although in some cases this is reduced to between 128 and 160 beats per minute. 

Many of its basic patterns are similar to these of the [[East Coast Swing]] with the major difference of highly [[syncopation (dance)|syncopated]] rhythm of the [[Triple Step]]s ([[Chasse]]s), which use [[straight eighths]] in ECS and [[hard swing]] in Jive. To the players of swing music in the 1930s and 1940s "Jive" was an expression denoting glib or foolish talk.&lt;ref&gt;Early Jazz: Its Roots and Musical Development. by Gunther Schuller. 1968. Oxford University Press. page 379. {{ISBN|0-19-504043-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American soldiers brought [[Lindy Hop]]/[[Jitterbug]]  to Europe around 1940, where this dance swiftly found a following among the young. In the United States the term Swing became the most common word used to describe the dance, and the term "jive" was adopted in the UK. Variations in technique led to styles such as boogie-woogie and swing boogie, with "jive" gradually emerging as the generic term in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Bottomer. 1997. Black Dog &amp; Leventhal. page 157. {{ISBN|1-57912-049-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the [[boogie]] became the dominant form for popular music. It was, however, never far from criticism as a foreign, vulgar dance. The famous ballroom dancing guru, [[Alex Moore (dancer)|Alex Moore]], said that he had "never seen anything uglier". In 1968 it was adopted as the fifth Latin dance in International competitions. The modern form of ballroom jive in the 1990s–present, is a very happy and boppy dance, the lifting of knees and the bending or rocking of the hips often occurs.

[[Image:Kattenstoet.jpg|thumb|''Minneke Poes'', one of the giant cats in the ''Kattenstoet'']]

The '''''Kattenstoet''''' (lit. "Festival of the Cats") is a parade in [[Ypres]], Belgium, devoted to the [[cat]]. It has been held regularly on the second Sunday of May since 1955.&lt;ref name="allred"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Muvn6KZR-xsC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=kattenstoet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KBvhUYu2JMfQhAeGnIGICw&amp;ved=0CDYQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kattenstoet&amp;f=false|title=Cats' Most Wanted: The Top 10 Book Of Mysterious Mousers, Talented Tabbies And Feline Oddities|author=Alexandra Powe Allred|publisher=Potomac Books|year=2005|page=234|isbn= 9781574888584}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, the 44th edition took place on May 10, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Streams|first1=Kimber|title=Kattenstoet, A Cat Parade Held Every Three Years in Ypres, Belgium|url=http://laughingsquid.com/kattenstoet-a-cat-parade-held-every-three-years-in-ypres-belgium/|website=Laughing Squid|publisher=Laughing Squid LLC|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the 45th expecting to take place on May 13, 2018.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kattenstoet.be/en/home.html|title=Kattenstoet (official site)|publisher=Vredesstad Ieper (Ypres town council)|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parade commemorates an Ypres tradition from the [[Middle Ages]] in which cats were thrown from the [[bell tower|belfry]] tower of the [[Cloth Hall, Ypres|Cloth Hall]] to the town square below.

==Background==
There are various legends about how the throwing of cats originated. One possibility is that cats were connected to [[witchcraft]], and the throwing of the cats symbolised the killing of evil spirits.&lt;ref name="frommer"&gt;{{cite book |title=Frommer's Belgium, Holland &amp; Luxembourg |author=George McDonald |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49GG3_8xV4EC&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;ots=Z8B_5ElMC4&amp;pg=PA203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-470-38227-1 |publisher=Frommer's |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last recorded event of this kind was in 1817.&lt;ref name="allred"/&gt; Another story suggests that the cats were brought into the [[Cloth Hall, Ypres|Cloth Hall]] (''Lakenhallen'') to control vermin. Before modern heating and storage methods, when it got cold the wool was stored in the upper floors of the Cloth Hall. At the start of the spring warm-up, after the wool had been sold, the cats were tossed out of the [[bell tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethesis.net/ieper_kattenfeesten/ieper_kattenfeesten.htm |title=De Kattenfeesten te Ieper. Een analyse van de Kattenstoet en het Kattenwerpen aan de hand van de theorie van Hobsbawm. |language=Dutch |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern festival==
[[File:Kattenstoet after ww2.jpg|thumb|upright|Kattenstoet in the 1950s]]

Symbolically reviving this practice for the parade festivities, a jester tosses plush children's-toy cats from the Cloth Hall belfry down to the crowd, which awaits with outstretched arms to catch one. The throwing of the cats from the belfry is followed by a mock [[witch hunt|witch burning]]. Participants in the festivities often dress as cats, witches, mice, or townspeople from ages past, and the festival also features brass bands and people riding on horseback. Around 2,000 people participated in the 2012 parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cheapflights.co.uk/news/love-cats-us-too-kattenstoet-festival-of-cats/|title=Love cats? We do too|author=Brett Ackroyd|publisher=Cheap Flights|date=12 May 2012|accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is a popular tourist event in Belgium and has helped strengthen the local tourist economy around Ypres. 8,000 people visited the event in 2000.&lt;ref name="allred"/&gt;

{{quote|Headquarters, Army of Northern Virginia, 10th April 1865.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
General Order

No. 9

After four years of arduous service marked by unsurpassed courage and fortitude, the Army of Northern Virginia has been compelled to yield to overwhelming numbers and resources.

I need not tell the survivors of so many hard fought battles, who have remained steadfast to the last, that I have consented to the result from no distrust of them.

But feeling that valour and devotion could accomplish nothing that could compensate for the loss that must have attended the continuance of the contest, I have determined to avoid the useless sacrifice of those whose past services have endeared them to their countrymen.

By the terms of the agreement, officers and men can return to their homes and remain until exchanged. You will take with you the satisfaction that proceeds from the consciousness of duty faithfully performed, and I earnestly pray that a merciful God will extend to you his blessing and protection.

With an unceasing admiration of your constancy and devotion to your Country, and a grateful remembrance of your kind and generous consideration for myself, I bid you an affectionate farewell.|R. E. Lee, General|General Order No. 9&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, vol. 4, pp. 154-55.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following is taken from a letter dated September 27, 1887, to General [[Bradley Tyler Johnson|Bradley T. Johnson]] from Colonel [[Charles Marshall (Colonel)|Charles Marshall]], CSA.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Buel, vol. 4, p. 747.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|General Lee's order to the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House was written the day after the meeting at McLean's house, at which the terms of the surrender were agreed upon. That night the general sat with several of us at a fire in front of his tent, and after some conversation about the army, and the events of the day, in which his feelings toward his men were strongly expressed, he told me to prepare an order to the troops.

The next day it was raining, and many persons were coming and going, so that I was unable to write without interruption until about 10 o'clock, when General Lee, finding that the order had not been prepared, directed me to get into his ambulance, which stood near his tent, and placed an orderly to prevent any one from approaching me.

I sat in the ambulance until I had written the order, the first draft of which (in pencil) contained an entire paragraph that was omitted by General Lee's direction. He made one or two verbal changes, and I then made a copy of the order as corrected, and gave it to one of the clerks in the adjutant-general's office to write in ink. I took the copy, when made by the clerk, to the general, who signed it, and other copies were then made for transmission to the corps commanders and the staff of the army. All these copies were signed by the general, and a good many persons sent other copies which they had made or procured, and obtained his signature. In this way many copies of the order had the general's name signed as if they were originals, some of which I have seen.}}

A '''royal wedding''' is a [[marriage ceremony]] involving members of a [[royal family]]. Weddings involving senior members of the royal family are often seen as important occasions of state and attract significant national and international attention. The following is a list of notable royal weddings:

== 19th century ==
===Russian Empire===
* [[Wedding of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna|26 November 1895]]: [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], the last [[Emperor of All Russia|Emperor of Russia]], was married to [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]] at the [[Grand Church of the Winter Palace]].

'''''Little Britain Live''''' is a stage show based on the TV sketch series ''[[Little Britain]]'', performed by its stars, [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] and [[David Walliams]], and directed by [[Jeremy Sams]]. Supporting characters are played by [[Paul Putner]] and Samantha Power (with [[Anthony Head]] and [[Ruth Jones]] in certain performances). As in the TV show, [[Tom Baker]] is the narrator, although his lines are pre-recorded. The show toured the United Kingdom from October 2005 until December 2006, and Australia from January–March 2007.

==Development==
In an interview in the show's program, Lucas and Walliams state that they had always wanted ''Little Britain'' to be a radio programme, a television series and live stage show.

After production of the third series of the television show, the duo settled down to write and plan the show. In rehearsals, the sketches were tweaked, re-ordered and re-written in order to accommodate the rapid costume and make-up changes required by the principal performers. To remove the need for stagehands to make set and prop changes, an elaborate stage floor was designed with track lines for the props. Sets were projected onto the background of the stage, with computer animated transitions designed by video and lighting designer [[Willie Williams (lighting designer)|Willie Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;''Little Britain Live'' programme&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain sketches required elaborate technical mechanisms, such as the vomit machine for the Judy and Maggie "Village Fete" sketch, and oversized props for the [[Dennis Waterman (Little Britain)|Dennis Waterman]] sketch.

During the show's UK run, several sketches were rewritten to improve the pacing, or removed in cases where the sketch was the same as the TV series.

==Performances==
The show's run began at the [[Portsmouth Guildhall]] in [[Portsmouth]], [[Hampshire]] on 23 October 2005. The show toured for 49 performances in 18 cities: [[Bournemouth]], [[Southend]], [[Plymouth]], [[Sheffield]], [[Manchester]], [[Nottingham]], [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Liverpool]], [[Oxford]], [[Bristol]], [[Ipswich]], [[Birmingham]], [[Blackpool]], [[Brighton]] and ending in [[Manchester]] on 20 December.

Lucas and Walliams took a month off, before resuming the UK tour and returning to the previously-toured cities. A month-long residency at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] in London in October and November 2006 followed, with two shows at the [[Brixton Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidwalliams.com/LittleBritainTour2005.htm Little Britain Tour 2005], DavidWalliams.com.&lt;/ref&gt; There were 3 live shows in Ireland during the summer of 2006, shown at the [[Point Theatre]] in Dublin.

'''''MTV New Year's''''' was a [[television special]] which aired on [[New Year's Eve]] annually on [[MTV]], though the title varies in some way every year. Since 1998, the special was typically broadcast from [[Times Square]] in [[New York City]], and prominently features coverage of its annual [[Times Square Ball|ball drop]] event, along with live performances by popular musicians from MTV Studios in [[One Astor Plaza]]. During the late 1990s, 2000s, and part of the early 2010s, the special was heavily promoted and featured top musical acts and celebrities but in recent years has been occasionally significantly reduced, often featuring just a one or two hosts broadcasting from the studios or a platform in Times Square with no audience or musical performances.

The network decided not to carry a special at the end of 2015 leading into 2016, choosing to carry a marathon of the viral clip series ''[[Ridiculousness (TV series)|Ridiculousness]]'' instead, with a teaser of the first segment of the next episode of the network's series ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]'' aired at midnight; the network and parent company [[Viacom]] in general went through number of staff and budget cutbacks in 2015 due to declining ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/mtv-teen-wolf-new-years-eve-ridiculousness-1201667455/|title=MTV Skips New Year’s Eve Special For ‘Teen Wolf’ Teaser, Marathons|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=23 December 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was repeated in subsequent years.

The park was about one hundred yards from her home. It was reported by her friend that a man between 25 and 35 with shoulder-length hair drove up to Harrison in his van and forced her into the vehicle and drove away. Harrison's companion described the abductor's van to have been a brown or dark red color that had round windows on the sides, near the rear.&lt;ref name=files /&gt; After she was kidnapped, volunteers searched for her body across Marshallville to no avail. It was initially believed that the man would demand ransom for Krista's return, yet no contact was made.&lt;ref name=vid&gt;{{cite web|last=Renner|first=James|title=The Final Word on the Tragic Death of Krista Harrison|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elfIzMihEsU|accessdate=March 17, 2014|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until six days later that her remains, which were in an advanced stage of decomposition, were discovered in the weeds a few feet off the side of a scarcely traveled road in adjacent Holmes County, Ohio. She had been strangled and sexually assaulted with a vibrator and a large plastic bag had been wrapped around her legs. Because of the condition of her remains, police were not able to identify the body until Harrison's father confirmed that it was his daughter. A [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] towel, a bloody car seat box, a wad of Harrison's hair, gloves, a plaid shirt and jeans were all found in the vicinity of the dump site.&lt;ref name=Prosecutor /&gt;&lt;ref name=files /&gt;&lt;ref name=Appeal&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Anthony Buell Appeal|url=http://www.michbar.org/opinions/us_appeals/2001/120401/13136.html|publisher=Michbar.org|accessdate=May 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020624124511/http://www.michbar.org/opinions/us_appeals/2001/120401/13136.html|archivedate=June 24, 2002|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examination of the remains indicated that the body was subjected to high temperatures, which was likely a consequence of her body remaining inside of the vehicle for a long period of time during summer weather.&lt;ref name=files/&gt; Harrison was buried in the Maple Grove Cemetery in Marshallville.&lt;ref name="Find A Grave" /&gt;

==Investigation==
[[File:Harmon fibers.jpg|thumb|Fibers found on Tina Harmon's body, which were similar to those on Harrison's body]]

On Harrison's body and the [[towel]] near the scene, a distinct number of nutmeg or orange-colored polyester fibers were found. After they were examined under a [[microscope]], investigators concluded that they were of trilobal shape and were likely from some type of carpet. Similar fibers were found on the body of [[Murder of Tina Harmon|Tina Harmon]], a 12-year-old girl who was raped and murdered eight months earlier. A man had already been convicted on circumstantial evidence in her death and was incarcerated when Harrison was abducted. Authorities then began to consider that both girls were victims of the same person, as they were both sexually violated, strangled, and killed in the same county. The two also had the same sort of fibers on their remains, further linking the crimes.&lt;ref name=files/&gt;

The bag found wrapped around the lower half of Harrison's body was unique, as it had distinct folding patterns and thickness that occurred during the manufacturing process. The bag was traced to a factory in [[Pioneer, Ohio]]. Such bags were used for packaging a type of car seat, which was black in color.&lt;ref name=files/&gt; These seats, sold through [[Sears]], were only available for a brief amount of time through mailing. The box containing Harrison's blood belonged to the same type of car seat. Sales records of the seats were subsequently examined from the store, to search for any Ohio resident who might purchased the seats. Twenty-three people in northern Ohio had purchased this type of car seat, but none owned a van that matched the one used during the abduction.&lt;ref name=files/&gt;

== Capture and trial of Robert Buell ==
{{quotebox|width=30%|align=left|quote="Jerry and Shirley, I didn't kill your daughter. The prosecutor knows that ... and they left the real killer out there on the streets to kill again and again and again." --Robert Anthony Buell's final words in 2002.&lt;ref name=Disciple&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Cleveland Scene]]|last=Renner, James|title=The Serial Killer's Disciple|url=https://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/ghosts-of-wayne-county/Content?oid=1534518}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Renner|first=James|title=Finding Amy's Killer|url=http://amymihaljevic.blogspot.com/2011_10_01_archive.html|accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
After Harrison's body was found, a $10,000 reward was placed for information about the abductor, which showed composite sketches of the perpetrator. None was arrested until two years later.&lt;ref name=files/&gt; In 1984, 44-year-old [[Robert Anthony Buell]], employed by the state of Ohio, kidnapped a 28-year-old woman while she was working as a manager at an Ohio gas station in [[Damascus, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=files /&gt; The woman's head was shaved, she was shocked with a severed electrical cord, beaten and was bound to Buell's bed and raped. She was able to escape, twelve hours later, fearing for her life, and ran to a nearby house and notified police after her attacker had left to go to work.&lt;ref name=Prosecutor&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark Prosecuter.org|title=Robert Anthony Buell|url=http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/buell801.htm|accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=files /&gt; Such a man had previously preyed on Ohio women, who were usually in their late twenties to forties.&lt;ref name=files/&gt;

[[File:Robert Anthony Buell.jpg|thumb|Robert Anthony Buell in 2001]]

Police then compared the orange carpet fibers found on Harrison's body to the ones in Buell's van, which was the same color as the one seen in 1982. The rear-view windows were of a different shape, although it was later revealed that they had been replaced. It was later concluded that the fibers on Harrison's body and the carpet in the van were a likely match and records from Sears indicated that Buell had purchased the same type of car seat that was once contained in the bag and box used to conceal the body. Paint found on the jeans near the dump site matched that on the outside of Buell's residence as well. The jeans themselves were similar to other pairs that he owned. Spray paint in his garage was also matched to some that was present on the box.&lt;ref name=files /&gt; A fingerprint on plastic concealing Harrison's body did not.&lt;ref name=Ghosts&gt;{{cite news|last=Renner|first=James|title=Ghosts Of Wayne County  Doubts Haunt An Old Murder And The Execution That Followed|url=http://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/ghosts-of-wayne-county/Content?oid=1534518|accessdate=February 24, 2014|newspaper=''Cleveland Scene''|date=December 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buell pleaded no contest to the abduction and rape of the adult victim, yet he denied any involvement with Krista's murder. He was found guilty after being tried and sentenced to death in 1984; he was executed by lethal injection in 2002.&lt;ref name= Prosecutor /&gt; He denied involvement and was never charged with the death of Tina Harmon, although dog hairs belonging to the remains of one found buried at his residence matched.
In 2010, DNA compared from the crime scene of Tina's murder to Buell's matched, therefore indicating that he was involved in her rape and most likely, her murder.&lt;ref name=vid /&gt;&lt;ref name=Disciple/&gt;&lt;ref name=Case&gt;{{cite web|last=Renner|first=James|title=Case Closed!|url=http://www.clevelandindependent.com/2010/03/26/case-closed-2/|publisher=IndeOnline.com|accessdate=May 31, 2012|date=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another victim who was murdered in 1983, Debora Kaye Smith, 10, had wax on her body that was from the same kind of candles that Buell owned. Her body was found over a month after her death, abandoned at the side of the [[Tuscarawas River]].&lt;ref name=wants/&gt;

Former journalist for the ''[[Cleveland Scene]]'' magazine, [[James Renner]], has written through several of his works that Buell's nephew, Ralph Ross Jr., may have played a role in the murders, if not having been fully responsible. He has also connected the cases to that of the unsolved murders of 13-year-old [[Murder of Barbara Barnes|Barbara Barnes]] and 10-year-old [[Murder of Amy Mihaljevic|Amy Mihaljevic]]. Similar fibers on the latter victim's body were found.&lt;ref name=Renner /&gt;&lt;ref name=wants&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rink|first1=Matthew|title=Family of Tina Harmon, abducted and killed in 1981, wants police to reopen the case|url=http://www.indeonline.com/article/20081126/News/311269903|accessdate=August 5, 2014|agency=Indie Online|date=November 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
[[File:Kanchanpur.png|thumb|[[Bhimdatta|Bhimdattanagar]] in Kanchanpur district]]
On Thursday 26 July 2018, a ninth-grade schoolgirl Nirmala Panta of [[Bhimdatta|Bhimdattanagar]]-2, left her home for study in her friend Roshani Bam's house.&lt;ref name="nagarik1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/teenager-raped-and-killed-in-kanchanpur/ | title=Teenager raped and killed in Kanchanpur}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kathmandupost1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-07-29/kanchanpur-tense-after-girls-rape-murder.html | title=Kanchanpur tense after girl's rape, murder}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[MyRepublica]] explains that she went to the Bam's house, which was one and a half kilometers away from her home, around 11 a.m. and spent 3 hours there before she left around 3 p.m. afterward which she did not reach home. The relatives filed a complaint about a missing girl in the local police station but the police refused and instructed to come next morning.&lt;ref name="nagarik1"/&gt; On Friday 27 July 2018, her dead body was found naked and placed on a one feet high waterlogged sugarcane field in Nimbukheda, Bhimdattanagar-18 about 500 meters far from Bam's house.&lt;ref name="nagarik1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kathmandupost1"/&gt;

==Investigation==
The local police identified Nirmala after her bicycle was found on the side of the road near the sugarcane farm.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost1"/&gt; The local police stated that she was murdered after [[rape]] as per the preliminary report.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost1"/&gt; CIB (Crime Investigation Bureau) team led by DSP Angur G.C. began the investigation on reaching Kanchanpur on four days after the incident. Kanchanpur Police and CIB team declared a mentally retarded man named ''Dilip Singh Bista'' as the culprit who was later proven innocent.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost4"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-09-17/new-team-to-scan-officers-for-faulty-investigation.html | title=New team to scan officers for faulty investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the spokesperson of [[Nepal Police]] SSP Shailesh Thapa Kshetri, the DNA sample of Dilip Singh was found unmatched with the vaginal swab of the victim and thus was released on 12 September 2018. The local public including the victim's family believes that Dilip Singh was innocent and maliciously framed as chief culprit on 20 August 2018 by the Kanchanpur Police.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost5"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2018-09-12/bista-bam-sisters-released.html | title=Bista, Bam sisters released}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bam sisters; Babita Bam and Roshani Bam were arrested on 23 August 2018 on the speculation of local public while they were also released after the legal consultation with District Attorney Office together with Dilip Singh.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost5"/&gt; Hari Prasad Mainali, Director General of Department of Prison Management, led a committee formed on 23 August 2018 by the Nepalese government to investigate the activities of Crime Investigation Bureau team and the Kanchanpur Police after they had reported a mentally retarded man as the perpetrator.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost4"/&gt; Kanchanpur Police Chief SP Dilli Raj Bista and Chief District Officer Kumar Bahadur Khadka were suspended for mishandling of the case on Saturday 25 August 2018.&lt;ref name="setopati1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://setopati.net/political/128910 | title=SP Bista to be suspended over mishandling of Nirmala Panta rape case}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were replaced by new officials.&lt;ref name="himalayan1"/&gt; The report of the Mainali Committee also resulted in the suspension of DSPs Gyan Bahadur Sethi and Angur GC, Inspectors Ekendra Khadka and Jagadish Bhatta and Assistant Sub-inspector Ram Singh Dhami by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs]] on Saturday.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://setopati.net/social/130408 | title=DIG Dhiru Basnet to lead investigation of rape and murder of Nirmala Panta}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police did not use the four [[sniffer dog]]s stationed at the provincial capital in [[Dhangadhi]] which locals consider to be a sheer negligence of the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/police-question-bam-sisters-over-rape-murder-of-nirmala-panta/ | title=Police question Bam sisters on rape, murder of Nirmala Panta| date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday 17 September 2018, nine police officials were interrogated for their connections in the investigation of the case which included Kanchanpur Police Chief SP Dili Raj Bista.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2018-09-18/basnyat-panel-grills-police-officials.html | title=Basnyat panel grills police officials}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Birendra K.C. quitted the Home Ministry investigation panel citing that the life threat was prevalent on him and his family from the group actively trying to undermine the investigation.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost5"/&gt; As per spokesperson of [[Nepal Police]] SSP Shailesh Thapa Kshetri, the DNA sample of SP Bista, his son Kiran Bista and Aayush Bista, nephew of Mayor of [[Bhimdatta]] Surendra Bista have been taken together with the vaginal swab of the victim for further investigation.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost4"/&gt; On 17 September 2018, a new investigation committee was set up by [[Nepal Police]] under DIG (Deputy Inspector General of Police) Dhiru Basnyat to overtake the former investigation committee led by SSP Uttam Subedi.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost4"/&gt; On the same day, Prime Minister [[Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli]] asserted that the assurance put upon the local police led to the derailment of the investigation. He speculates that either the police have forged the investigation or had committed mistakes in the investigation.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost2"/&gt; Panta couples traveled 35 hours bus journey to [[Kathmandu]] to draw the attention of the central government on the case.&lt;ref name="himalayan1"/&gt; PM Oli assured Panta couples to prosecute and punish the guilty person irrespective of his money, power, post or influences.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost2"/&gt; 

On 18 September 2018, the Kanchanpur police chief SP Kuber Kathayat admitted that there is no concrete evidence till date and investigation was ongoing. The government had earlier set up investigation panel due to the destruction of evidence by the local investigating police after the discovery of the body of the victim.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost6"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-09-18/investigators-still-clueless.html | title=Kanchanpur rape and murder case: Investigators still 'clueless'}}&lt;/ref&gt; DIG Dhiru Basnyat who was appointed as the leading officer to a nine-member probe committee formed on 16 September 2018 for new investigation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-09-16/kanchanpur-rape-and-murder-probe-committee-formed-under-dig-dhiru-basnet.html | title=Kanchanpur rape and murder: Probe committee formed under DIG Dhiru Basnyat}}&lt;/ref&gt;, stated to begin the investigation from a completely new perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-09-16/kanchanpur-rape-and-murder-probe-committee-formed-under-dig-dhiru-basnet.html | title=Kanchanpur rape and murder: Probe committee formed under DIG Dhiru Basnyat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demands and Opinions==
The brother of the victim, Laxmi Prasad Panta, asserted that the last rites will not be performed unless the perpetrators are punished, the victim's family are compensated and a police beat is established at Nimbukheda.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost1"/&gt; On 12 September 2018 in a conversation with [[The Himalayan Times]], Yagya Raj Panta, father of Nirmala Panta, spoke about the atrocities of local police and local authorities and their forceful exertions to cremate the dead body instead of full-fledged investigation. Yagya Raj Panta and his wife Durga Devi Panta, continuously believe that Babita Bam and Roshani Bam (friend of Nirmala) are prime suspects.&lt;ref name="himalayan1"/&gt; He quoted: &lt;blockquote&gt;{{Quote|text=The authorities mistreated us from the Day One of the incident despite the fact that we were the victims. The police didn’t even let us shed tears right after we came to know about our daughter’s death. They used harsh language and dragged us to their office and district administration office every now and then. The chief district officer, who has now been transferred, on the other hand, exerted pressure on us to cremate the body immediately instead of focusing on rounding up the criminal.&lt;ref name="himalayan1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/nirmala-panta-parents-in-capital-seeking-justice/ | title=Nirmala's parents in capital seeking justice| date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Nirmala's mother Durga Devi accused local police of destroying the evidence and misleading the investigation:{{quote|How can we expect justice to be delivered under these circumstances? What is even more worrying is all the evidences at the crime scene have been erased by the police. Worse, the investigation is not headed in the right direction, which is creating more confusion.&lt;ref name="himalayan1"/&gt;}} The locals continuously believe that Dilip Singh Bista was framed by the police to hide the real culprits.&lt;ref name="setopati1"/&gt; They demanded that the [[Nepal Army]] be investigated as an army barrack was near to the incident site.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost6"/&gt;

==Reactions and Public Protests==
The incident sparked public outrage and eventually broke social media which resulted in many public demonstrations.&lt;ref name="himalayan1"/&gt; Prime Minister [[Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli]] in a meeting with the victim's parents and lawmakers of [[Province No. 7]], gave an assurance of justice to the victim's parents.&lt;ref name="kathmandupost2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-09-17/pm-assures-of-justice-to-nirmalas-parents.html | title=PM assures of justice to Nirmala's parents}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the public demonstrations in the Bhimdattanagar, one boy has died in the clash against the police forces.

'''Operation Auxin''' was an Australian police operation in September 2004, leading to the [[arrest]] of almost 200 people on charges of [[child pornography]]. These people were all accused of purchasing child pornography over the [[Internet]], using their [[credit card]]s, from [[Belarus]]ian [[Organized crime|crime syndicates]], the credit card payments having been processed by a company named Landslide.com in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]]. Among the accused were people holding positions of trust in the community, such as [[police officer]]s (including one  officer assigned to investigate child pornography), members of the military, [[teacher]]s and [[minister of religion|minister]]s of religion. Several of the suspects committed [[suicide]]. It was the follow-up to the U.S. [[FBI]] operation [[Operation Falcon (child pornography crackdown)|Operation Falcon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Auxin explained|url=http://www.smh.com.au/media/2004/09/30/1096527872004.html|website=Sydney Morning Herald|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211143041/http://www.smh.com.au/media/2004/09/30/1096527872004.html|archivedate=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial credit card evidence used in the investigation has since been widely debunked due to there being no established link between a credit card being used and actual pornography being downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Duncan|title=Operation Ore flawed by fraud|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/apr/19/hitechcrime.money|website=The Guardian|date=19 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, multiple cases of [[credit card fraud]] involving organised crime syndicates has also raised the possibility that credit card numbers retrieved from Landslide.com may have been used by a third party and not their owners at all.&lt;ref name=alphr&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Duncan|title=Operation Ore exposed|url=http://www.alphr.com/features/74690/operation-ore-exposed|website=Alphr|date=1 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar operations in the UK have come under intense fire both from those wrongfully convicted and from civil rights groups.&lt;ref name=alphr/&gt;

== Overview ==
First described in 1976 as "pathological alignment", parental alienation refers to a situation in which a child unreasonably rejects a non-custodial parent.&lt;ref name = Bow2009&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bow | first = JN |author2=Gould JW |author3=Flens JR | year = 2009 | title = Examining Parental Alienation in Child Custody Cases: A Survey of Mental Health and Legal Professionals | journal = The American Journal of Family Therapy | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–145 | doi = 10.1080/01926180801960658|url=http://www.drjamesrflens.com/_Bow_et_al.__2009___Examing_parental_alienation_in_child_custody_case.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Richard A. Gardner]] proposed [[parental alienation syndrome]] in the 1980s based on his clinical experience with the children of divorcing parents. Parental alienation lacks a single definition and its existence, cause and characteristics have been the subject of debate. Gardner's concept of a syndrome has failed to gain acceptance. Some [[empirical research]] has been performed, though the quality of the studies vary widely and research in the area is still developing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hands | first1 = A. J. | last2 = Warshak | first2 = R. A. | year = 2011 | title = Parental Alienation Among College Students | url = | journal = The American Journal of Family Therapy | volume = 39 | issue = 5| pages = 431–443 | doi=10.1080/01926187.2011.575336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of literature suggests that alienating behaviors by both parents are common in high-conflict divorces.&lt;ref name = Bow2009/&gt; Rejected parents tend to lose a sense of warmth and empathy with the child. As a result, the rejected parent may become passive, depressed, anxious, and withdrawn – characteristics that may encourage further rejection. The parent that the child aligns with (the aligned parent) may engage in alienating behaviors, including undermining the other parent. These behaviors may be conscious and deliberate or may reflect a lack of awareness on the effect of the actions on the children.  Direct alienating behaviors occur when one parent actively undermines the other parent, such as making derogatory remarks about the other parent, telling the child that the other parent is responsible for the separation, or telling the child that the other parent is the cause of financial difficulties. Indirect alienation behaviors occur when one parent fails to support access or contact with the other parent or tacitly accepts the child's negative behaviour and comments towards the other parent.&lt;ref name = Bow2009/&gt;&lt;ref name = Bala2007/&gt;

=== Causes ===
The causes of alienation can be divided into two broad categories,
*Realistic estrangement, in which a parent's harmful or abusive behaviors or substance abuse result in the alienation of the child;&lt;ref name=acorn/&gt; and
*Pathological alienation, in which the alienation results from pathological aspects of the child's family relationships, and is not a rational response to the behavior of the alienated parent.
Realistic estrangement is a different phenomenon from "pathological alienation".  The former is an understandable refusal by a child to see an [[child abuse|abusive]] parent, while the latter is emotionally harmful and unjustified.&lt;ref name = Bala2007/&gt;

=== Symptoms ===
Symptoms associated with parental alienation include:
*The child engages in a pattern of "denigration" against a targeted parent for unjustified reasons and uses "frivolous rationalizations" that are "disproportionate" to the circumstances.&lt;ref name=inq/&gt;
*The child may display a "complete lack of ambivalence" wherein the rejected parent is viewed as "all bad" and the favored parent is viewed as "all good."&lt;ref name=echo/&gt; This lack of ambivalence is associated with "[[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]]."&lt;ref name="newsweek2014"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bernet et al.

*The child may use "borrowed scenarios" that involve making "identical" statements to those of the "alienating parent" when the alienating parent makes disparaging comments against the rejected parent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
*The child may display an "independent thinker phenomenon" which involves comments by the child that their decision to reject the targeted parent was arrived at without any influence from the alienating parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Baker, J.

==Theories==
Some researchers emphasized the role of an alienating parent, termed variously the "programming" parent or "embittered-chaotic parent",&lt;ref name = Bow2009/&gt; while other researchers have focused on the "alienated child", and the relationship dynamics that contribute to the alienation.&lt;ref name="Bala2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Bala|first = N|author2 = Fidler B|author3 = Goldberg D|author4 = Houston C|year = 2007|journal = Queens Law Journal|volume = 33|title = Alienated Children and Parental Separation: Legal Responses from Canada's Family Courts|pages = 79–138|url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/queen33&amp;div=7&amp;id=&amp;page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaffe2002&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaffe |first=PG |author2=Lemon NKD |author3=Poisson SE  |title=Child Custody &amp; Domestic Violence |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |year=2002 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bbZmp7ALOq4C&amp;pg=PA52 52–54] |isbn=978-0-7619-1826-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of relationship dynamics, alienation is seen as a breakdown of [[attachment (psychology)|attachment]] between parent and child that may be caused by a variety factors. These researchers have proposed a more complex analysis, in which all family members may play a role in the alienation. This "systems-based" view acknowledges that a child may be alienated from one parent with no alienation programming from the other parent.&lt;ref name = Bow2009/&gt;&lt;ref name = Bala2007/&gt; The behaviors of all family members, including those of the alienated parent, may lead to [[family dysfunction]] and the rejection of a parent.&lt;ref name= Ackerman2001&gt;{{cite book |author=Ackerman MJ |title=Clinician's guide to child custody evaluations |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] |location=New York |year=2001 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=q9E_rg94Cs4C&amp;pg=PA73 73–82] |isbn=978-0-471-39260-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waldron1996&gt;{{cite journal |last=Waldron |first=KH |author2=Joanis DE |url= http://fact.on.ca/Info/pas/waldron.htm |title=Understanding and Collaboratively Treating Parental Alienation Syndrome |journal=American Journal of Family Law |volume=10 |pages= 121–133 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this approach, when a child is estranged from a parent it is necessary to evaluate all contributing factors and all possible remedies to the estrangement.&lt;ref name=Bala2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sparta2006&gt;{{cite book |last=Sparta |first=SN |author2=Koocher GP |title=Forensic Mental Health Assessment of Children and Adolescents |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2006 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6bmBtQ2Zl-IC&amp;pg=PA83 83], [https://books.google.com/books?id=6bmBtQ2Zl-IC&amp;pg=PA219 219–221] |isbn=978-0-19-514584-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism===
The techniques of harmful parenting may be subtle and "genuine".&lt;ref name=inq/&gt;&lt;ref name=acorn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fidler/&gt; A parent can [[Triangulation (psychology)|triangulate]] the child into the marital conflict&lt;ref name="irishtimes"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gartland |first1=Fiona |title=Jail time for parental alienation not in best interests of children |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/jail-time-for-parental-alienation-not-in-best-interests-of-children-1.2350370 |website=Irish Times |accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
by encouraging the child to make even minor complaints about the other parent and then "enthusiastically validating" them. This signals to the child that the other parent is dangerous&lt;ref name=echo/&gt;&lt;ref name="BakerSurviving"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baker |first1=Amy |title=Surviving Parental Alienation, Part 2: The parental alienation tipping point |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/caught-between-parents/201410/surviving-parental-alienation-part-2|website=Psychology Today |accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}
and insensitive.&lt;ref name=echo/&gt;&lt;ref name=BakerSurviving/&gt; This encouragement to complain manipulates the child into the role of victim without the child's awareness,&lt;ref name=stines2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=BakerSurviving/&gt; allowing the parent to move into the protector role, forcing the other parent into the "inadequate" parent role, and leaving no trace of what happened for bystanders who only see the child acting as a "victim".&lt;ref name=echo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenfield2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsweek2014/&gt; Over time, the combined effects of growing closer to the alienating parent through this complaining process&lt;ref name=echo/&gt; and growing further from the rejected parent as the result of focusing on negative things about the other parent cause the child to reject their other parent as being inadequate.

A parent may also mix in [[lie]]s,&lt;ref name=echo/&gt; partial lies,&lt;ref name=BakerSurviving/&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} and [[exaggerations]],&lt;ref name=echo/&gt; particularly ones that the child may not be able to verify or where only the true part of the partial lie is easy to verify.&lt;ref name=toxicex&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Amy|title=Coparenting with a Toxic Ex|date=2014|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|isbn=978-1608829583|pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the result of being encouraged to act as judge of their rejected parent,&lt;ref name=echo/&gt; the child then feels superior to their rejected parent, leading to the symptoms of [[grandiosity]], entitlement, and haughty arrogance. This feeds the [[delusion]] of the parent, that they are protecting the child from an inadequate parent.&lt;ref name=Greenfield2015/&gt; The child then begins to adopt this [[delusion]] also.&lt;ref name=acorn/&gt;&lt;ref name=echo/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsweek2014/&gt;

===Treatment===
The success of restoring the child's [[Attachment in children|attachment]] to their parent hinges on first protecting the child from harmful parenting.&lt;ref name=acorn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenfield2015/&gt; A study suggests that the child does not experience this protection as being traumatic.&lt;ref name=Greenfield2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kruk2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kruk|first1=Edward|title=Recent Advances in Understanding Parental Alienation: Implications of Parental Alienation Research for Family-Based Intervention|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/co-parenting-after-divorce/201507/recent-advances-in-understanding-parental-alienation|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one theory,&lt;ref name=LudmerIntervention/&gt; when symptoms of alienation are present, structured intervention is likely to be more effective than traditional counseling. Structured intervention involves:
* developing critical thinking to overcome rejection and enmeshment dynamics
* resetting the child's place in the family hierarchy
* addressing the family system
* temporarily protecting the child from the bad parenting practices of the enmeshed parent.

Advocates of structured intervention argue that traditional counseling, based on the therapeutic alliance, is susceptible to:
* delays from a lack of milestones and schedules
* sabotage by a parent with an interest in making it fail
* exclusive focus on a child's feelings and complaints to the exclusion of addressing the family system
* the ineffectiveness of a parent apologizing for fabricated, exaggerated, or distorted complaints.

According to this theoretical formulation, "the pathology traditionally called ‘parental alienation' are manifestations of well-established forms of existing pathologies.”&lt;ref name=Pingitore2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenfield2015/&gt;

== Professional acceptance ==
The history of parental alienation reflects an evolution of its acceptance by professionals involved in custody cases. A 2009 survey of mental health and legal professionals found broad skepticism of the concept of parental alienation syndrome, and caution in relation to the concept of parental alienation.&lt;ref name = Bow2009/&gt;

===Mental health professionals===
Mental health professionals are reluctant to recognize so-called parental alienation syndrome.&lt;ref name = Bow2009/&gt; In the past, the American Psychiatric Association and American Psychological Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on Parental Alienation Syndrome|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2008/01/pas-syndrome.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|accessdate=7 October 2017|date=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; have held a neutral view of parental alienation as a distinct syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;'Parental Alienation, DSM-5, and ICD-11: Response to Critics' William Bernet, MD and Amy J. L. Baker, PhD (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In anticipation of the fifth version of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], which was released in 2013, William Bernet argued for the inclusion of ''parental alienation disorder'', a diagnosis related to parental alienation. His conception makes reference to parental alienation and a variety of other descriptions of behaviors he believes represent the underlying concept of parental alienation disorder.&lt;ref name=Bernet2008&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bernet | first=W| title= Parental Alienation Disorder and DSM-V | journal = The American Journal of Family Therapy | volume = 36 | issue = 5 | year = 2008 | pages = 349–366 | doi = 10.1080/01926180802405513  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite lobbying by proponents,&lt;ref name="Rotstein2010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10046/1036018-114.stm|title=Mental health professionals getting update on definitions|last=Rotstein|first=Gary|date=February 15, 2010 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |accessdate=2010-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2012, the proposal was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees Approves DSM-5-Diagnostic manual passes major milestone before May 2013 publication|url=http://dsmfacts.org/materials/american-psychiatric-association-board-of-trustees-approves-dsm-5/|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|date=1 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005021044/http://dsmfacts.org/materials/american-psychiatric-association-board-of-trustees-approves-dsm-5/|archivedate=5 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that elements of parental alienation are covered in the [[DSM-5]] under the diagnosis: "Parent-Child Relational Problem".&lt;ref name="bernetw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernet|first1=William|last2=Wamboldt|first2=Marianne Z.|last3=Narrow|first3=William E.|title=Child Affected by Parental Relationship Distress|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|date=July 2016|volume=55|issue=7|pages=571–579|url=http://www.kenniscentrum-kjp.nl/app/webroot/files/tmpwebsite/Downloadables_trauma_en_kindermishandeling_bijlagen/Bernet_et_al._-_CAPRD_-_2016-07.pdf|accessdate=7 October 2017|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2016.04.018|pmid=27343884}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the child's perception of an alienated parent "may include negative attributions of the other's intentions, hostility toward or scapegoating of the other (parent), and unwarranted feelings of estrangement".&lt;ref&gt;Kay, B.

===Courts===
In a survey at the Association of Family and Conciliation Courts in 2010, 98% of the 300 respondents agreed with the question, "Do you think that some children are manipulated by one parent to irrationally and unjustifiably reject the other parent?".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lorandos, D., W. Bernet and S.R. Sauber (2013). Overview of Parental Alienation. In {{cite book|last1=Lorandos|first1=Demosthenes|last2=Bernet|first2=William|last3=Sauber|first3=S. Richard|title=Parental Alienation: The Handbook for Mental Health and Legal Professionals|date=2013|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|isbn=978-0398087500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNfCCAAAQBAJ|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, parental alienation refers not to the acts of manipulation, but rather to the child's rejection of a parent that results from alienating behavior.

Some courts recognize parental alienation as a form of child abuse with long-term effects and serious outcomes for the child. Some jurisdictions, including Brazil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazil: Parental Alienation Criminalized|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/brazil-parental-alienation-criminalized/|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=7 October 2017|date=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mexico, have enacted parental alienation as a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hill|first1=Amelia|title=Programme aims to help people affected by 'parental alienation'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/14/programme-aims-to-help-people-affected-by-parental-alienation|accessdate=7 October 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other jurisdictions may suspend child support in cases where parental alienation occurs.  For example, in New York, in ''Matter of Robert Coull v. Pamela Rottman'', No. 2014-01516, 2015 N.Y. App. Div. LEXIS 6611 (September 2, 2015), where the father was prevented from seeing his son by the child's mother through a "pattern of alienation", child support was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title=Father Not Obligated to Pay Child Support, Panel Finds | author=Denney, Andrew | publisher=New York Law Journal | date=9 September 2015 | url=http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202736637831/Father-Not-Obligated-to-Pay-Child-Support-Panel-Finds }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some United States courts have also tried to address the issue through mandated reunification therapy; but no federal or state laws regulating parental alienation currently exist in the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wkfamilylaw.com/parental-alienation-crime/], "Should Parental Alienation Be A Crime?" - Wallin &amp; Klarich Family Law&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the nature of allegations of parental alienation, many courts require that a qualified expert witness testify in support of allegations of parental alienation or in association with any allegation that a parent has a mental health disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novotney|first1=Amy|title=Custody collaborations|journal=Monitor on Psychology|date=July 2008|volume=39|issue=7|page=48|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/07-08/child-custody.aspx|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While states have broadly rejected parental alienation syndrome as a concept that may be presented in a child custody case, it remains possible to argue that parental alienation has occurred, and to demonstrate how a parent's alienating behaviors should be considered by a court when evaluating a custody case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Parental Alienation in Child Custody Cases|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/child_custody/parental_alienation.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=7 October 2017|date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviors that result in parental alienation may reflect other mental health disorders, both on the part of the alienating parent and the alienated parent, that may be relevant to a custody determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Joan B.|last2=Johnston|first2=Janet R.|title=The Alienated Child: A Reformulation of Parental Alienation Syndrome|journal=Family Court Review|date=July 2001|volume=39|issue=3|pages=249–266|doi=10.1111/j.174-1617.2001.tb00609.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavior of the alienated child may also be a relevant factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Amy J.L.|last2=Eichler|first2=Amy|title=The Linkage Between Parental Alienation Behaviors and Child Alienation|journal=Journal of Divorce and Remarriage|date=2016|volume=57|issue=7|pages=475–484|doi=10.1080/10502556.2016.1220285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the Stephen Sondheim musical|the never-produced musical by [[Irving Berlin]], also about the Mizners|Wise Guy (musical)}}

'''''Road Show''''' (previously titled '''''Bounce''''', and before that '''''Wise Guys''''' and '''''Gold!''''') is a [[Musical theatre|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and a book by [[John Weidman]]. It tells the story of [[Addison Mizner]] and his brother [[Wilson Mizner]]'s adventures across [[United States|America]] from the beginning of the 20th century during the [[Klondike gold rush]] to the [[Florida]] real estate boom of the 1920s.

After a 1999 workshop in [[New York City]], the musical was produced in [[Chicago]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] in 2003 under the title ''Bounce'', but it did not achieve much success.  A revised version of the musical premiered [[Off-Broadway]] in New York in October 2008.

The musical takes considerable liberties with the facts of Addison's and Wilson's lives.

==Production history==
The musical premiered at the [[New York Theatre Workshop]] from October through November 1999 under the title ''Wise Guys''.  It was directed by [[Sam Mendes]] and starred [[Nathan Lane]] and [[Victor Garber]] as brothers [[Addison Mizner]] and [[Wilson Mizner]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth and [[Simonson, Robert]]. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/49231.html "Sondheim's Wise Guys Will Not Appear on Bway in April 2000"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927191030/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/49231.html |date=2007-09-27 }} Playbill.com, November 29, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  A legal case involving [[Scott Rudin]] and Weidman and Sondheim held up further production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sondheim.com/news/gold_a_wise_decision.html Court case and background information on sondheim.com] sondheim.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantially rewritten and retitled ''Bounce'', the show opened on June 20, 2003 at the [[Goodman Theatre]] in [[Chicago]].  The production was directed by [[Harold Prince]], with choreography by Michael Arnold, set design by [[Eugene Lee (designer)|Eugene Lee]], costume design by Miguel Angel Huidor, lighting design by [[Howell Binkley]], and hair design by David H. Lawrence.  The cast starred [[Richard Kind]] (Addison Mizner), [[Howard McGillin]] (Wilson Mizner), [[Jane Powell]] (Mama Mizner), Herndon Lackey (Papa Mizner/Businessman/Englishman/Plantation Owner/Armstrong/Real Estate Owner), [[Gavin Creel]] (Hollis Bessemer), and [[Michele Pawk]] (Nellie).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sondheim.com/news/bway_loses_its_bounce.html "B'way Loses Its 'Bounce'" at sondheim.com] sondheim.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical then ran at the [[Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in October and November 2003 with the Chicago cast.  It received mixed–to–negative reviews and was not produced in New York.&lt;ref name=tm&gt;Portantiere, Michael.[http://www.theatermania.com/content/news.cfm/story/4067 "Reviews: Bounce"], theatermania.com, November 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simonson, Robert.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/81102.html "Bounce Bounces Out of Chicago; Kennedy Center Is Next Hop"] playbill.com, August 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sondheimguide.com/bounce.html Sondheim Guide / Bounce] sondheimguide.com&lt;/ref&gt;  A private reading of ''Bounce'' was held at the [[Public Theater]] on February 6, 2006.

A Chicago version opened at the [[Chicago Shakespeare Theatre]] on March 13, 2014, starring [[Andrew Rothenberg]] as Wilson and Michael Aaron Lidner as Addison.

The New England premiere of ''Road Show'' ran from January 12 to February 11, 2018 at The Lyric Stage Company of Boston in Boston, MA.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.broadwayworld.com/boston/article/BWW-Review-Sondheims-ROAD-SHOW-Looking-For-America-20180123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early versions==
In the workshop, titled ''Wise Guys,'' the show was framed as a [[vaudeville]] act, with Wilson and Addison opening the show with the title song, in the style of vaudeville comics, a theme that recurred over the show.  There was an additional song for Mama Mizner called 'Brothers,' and a song for Wilson titled 'Stay Right Where You Are' in which he seduces his future wife.  Addison had a song in Act II sung to a sick Wilson called "Make it Through the Night."  This version dealt with Addison's real-life business partner Paris Singer.  However, the writers soon decided to deal more openly with Addison's sexuality, and since Singer was heterosexual, Sondheim and Weidman invented the character of Hollis Bessemer.&lt;ref&gt;Sondheim, Stephen - Look I Made a Hat: Collected Lyrics (1981-2011) with Attendant Comments, Amplifications, Dogmas, Harangues, Digressions, Anecdotes and Miscellany&lt;/ref&gt;  The vaudeville concept was eventually dropped.

In the later stage version titled ''Bounce,'' the character of Wilson's wife was developed into a secondary lead called Nellie.  Wilson first meets her in a saloon in Alaska, where she seduces him with the song "What's Your Rush?" They re-encounter each other in New York, Nellie having become rich on the brothers' gold claim, and they marry after the song 'The Best Thing That Ever Has Happened.'  She divorces him when his enterprises interfere with their love life.  The brothers meet her again in Florida, where she joins in the Boca Raton scheme.  After this fails, she leaves with Hollis to find her next opportunity.  In ''Road Show'', her character was again reduced to Wilson's marriage to her in Act I.

For the ''Road Show'' version, Sondheim rewrote the opening number "Bounce" as "Waste," to reflect a darker tone. He added an additional song, "Brotherly Love," for the Mizners, and rewrote "The Best Thing That Ever Has Happened" as a duet for Addison and Hollis.

==Plot==
After the 1933 death of Addison Mizner, people who knew him, including his estranged lover Hollis Bessemer, comment on his life and the way he squandered his talents ("Waste"). Addison's younger brother Wilson appears and speaks to Addison, who angrily claims that Wilson was the cause of all his failures. The time shifts to Papa Mizner's death in [[California]] at the beginning of the 20th century. On his deathbed, Papa charges his sons with the task of using their gifts to shape America ("It's In Your Hands Now"), telling them that there's a "road" to follow. Mama Mizner reveals the family's wealth has been eaten away by Papa's long illness and advises the boys to seek [[gold rush|gold in Alaska]]; Addison is reluctant, but goes along with Wilson anyway ("Gold!").

In the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]], the brothers share a sleeping bag and reminisce about their childhood ("Brotherly Love"). Wilson leaves to get supplies while Addison works the claim. Wilson is lured into a game of poker. Addison is shocked to discover his brother gambling. Wilson explains his newfound love of taking risks regardless of what's at stake ("The Game"). Wilson stakes their gold claim in a poker game and wins the saloon in which the game is taking place. (This episode is fictitious.) A shade of Papa Mizner appears and tells Addison that this was not what he had in mind for his sons.

Addison leaves in disgust with his share of Wilson's winnings and travels around the world searching for business opportunities and a sense of purpose ("Addison's Trip"). All of his ventures fail due to bad luck. He is left with nothing but souvenirs that inspire him to take up architecture (so he can design a house in which to show them off). Wilson's businesses in Alaska also have failed, so he comes south to seek his brother's help. Wilson seduces and marries Addison's first client, a rich widow, and fritters away her money on various flashy endeavours, including fixed boxing matches and horse races ("That Was A Year").

Although Wilson's various partners lose money, they remain fond of him because of the verve and energy with which he lives. Even Mama Mizner, who is being looked after by Addison and never receives any visits from Wilson, enjoys reading about Wilson's exploits, saying that she can live through him ("Isn't He Something!"). Only Addison remains uncharmed by Wilson, and when Wilson finally comes back, his resources exhausted, he finds that Mama has died in his absence. Addison angrily throws Wilson out of the house.

Learning of rising property interests in [[Florida]] ("Land Boom!"), Addison decides to travel to [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] to take advantage of the many rich people settling there who need houses built. (In reality, Mizner went there for his health.) On the train he meets the fictitious Hollis Bessemer, with whom he is instantly smitten. Hollis is the son of a wealthy industrialist, cut off by his father for refusing to enter the family business. His real passion is art, and although he is not himself talented, he dreams of creating an artists' colony in Palm Beach with the help of his aunt, who is staying there in a hotel ("Talent").

Addison shows Hollis's aunt a plan for a house he proposes to build for her. Impressed, she agrees and offers to sponsor Hollis's artists' colony. However, Hollis and Addison, now lovers, are too busy designing resort homes for the rich ("You") and enjoying each other's company ("The Best Thing That Ever Has Happened") to follow up on Hollis's original plan. Wilson arrives at Hollis's and Addison's house, destitute and sick ("The Game [Reprise]"). Addison reluctantly takes him in, and when Wilson has recovered, he begins to work on Hollis, persuading him to be a patron to his newest scheme: to build a brand new city in [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]] with Wilson as promoter and Addison as chief architect ("Addison's City").

Wilson's con man instincts resurface. He promotes the Boca Raton real estate scheme with increasingly extravagant and eventually fraudulent claims, creating a price bubble ("Boca Raton"). Addison goes along, until it is Hollis who finally puts a stop to the real-estate scheme. He asks Addison choose between Wilson and him. Addison, brought to a state of desperation, drives Hollis away by claiming he never loved him. Addison also orders Wilson out of his life ("Get Out"), but Wilson insists Addison loves him too much ("Go"). Addison agrees, but still wants him to go. Wilson leaves for good.

But not quite, for in the finale (returning to the first scene) all the characters leave the stage except for Wilson and Addison. At this point, Wilson realises that he, too, has died. The brothers bicker half-heartedly, their differences no longer mattering enough to keep them apart. Confronted by their father, they shrug off his criticisms and the brothers set out together on the road to eternity—or, as Wilson calls it, "the greatest opportunity of all." "Sooner or later," he says, "we're bound to get it right."

==Historical liberties==
{{unref|section|date=March 2018}}

The musical is sometimes taken as a faithful portrayal of the two brothers' lives. This is not quite the case. While Addison was an architect and Wilson a con man, among other things, Hollis Bessemer is fictitious; he has some similarities to Addison's friend [[Paris Singer]], but Singer was not a homosexual and certainly not Addison's lover. Addison's homosexuality, while no secret, was at the time kept much quieter than it is in the musical; he never had a "lover". Wilson's role in the Boca Raton fiasco is exaggerated, and while he did marry a rich widow, who quickly divorced him, she had not been a client of Addison. Addison never blamed Wilson for all his problems. Mama Mizner was not behind the boys' gold mining. While Addison did travel considerably, it was not around the world, and it was not the case that part of it was a string of businesses. Addison's alleged decisión to become an architect so as to build a house for his souvenirs is colorful, but fictitious.

==Critical response==
Referring to the 2003 ''Bounce'' productions, theatertermania.com wrote, "A brace of mixed-to-negative reviews has all but assured that this production of Bounce will not be coming to New York."&lt;ref name=tm/&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' noted in an article in November 2003 that "the show, which received lukewarm reviews in two tryout runs, is not coming to Broadway anytime soon."&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, Jesse.[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/19/theater/confirmed-no-bounce-to-broadway-this-season.html "Confirmed: No 'Bounce' To Broadway This Season"]''The New York Times'', November 19, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Brantley]], in his ''New York Times'' review of the 2003 Kennedy Center production, said "[It] never seems to leave its starting point...Mr. Kind and Mr. McGillin execute this self-introduction [title song] charmingly, translating wryness and ruefulness into a breezy soft-shoe sensibility. But in a sense, when they have finished the song they have already delivered the whole show...''Bounce,'' which features the vibrant Michele Pawk as a zestful gold digger (of both Klondike and jazz-age varieties) and Jane Powell as the Mizners' mother, only rarely kicks into a higher gear than the one that gently propels the opening duet...their trajectory feels as straight and flat as a time line in a history book. The bounce in ''Bounce'' is never very high...Much of the music, while whispering of earlier, more flashily complex Sondheim scores, has a conventional surface perkiness that suggests a more old-fashioned, crowd-pleasing kind of show than is this composer's wont. But his extraordinary gift for stealthily weaving dark motifs into a brighter musical fabric is definitely in evidence, mellifluously rendered in the peerless Jonathan Tunick's orchestrations."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben.[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/01/theater/theater-review-sondheim-guides-two-brothers-on-a-tour-of-life.html "Review: Sondheim Guides Two Brothers On a Tour of Life"]''The New York Times'', November 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Brantley, in his review of the 2008 production, praised Ceveris and Gemignani, but declares that, "The problem is that this musical’s travelogue structure precludes its digging deep. It hints at dark and shimmering glories beneath the surface that it never fully mines. Like its leading characters, 'Road Show' doesn’t quite know what to do with the riches at its disposal."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9129">'''Similarity''' refers to the psychological nearness or proximity of two [[mental representation]]s. &lt;!--It is one of the [[principles of grouping]] in [[Gestalt psychology]]: according to Daniel Schachter, "regions that are similar in color, lightness, shape, or texture are perceived as belonging to the same object".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schacter|first1=Daniel|last2=Gilbert|first2=Daniel|last3=Wegner|first3=Daniel|last4=Hood|first4=Bruce|title=Psychology|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230343672|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqAcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144|language=en|date=2011|chapter=Recognizing Objects by Sight|edition=European}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Research in [[cognitive psychology]] has taken a number of approaches to the concept of similarity. Each of them is related to a particular set of assumptions about [[knowledge representation]].

==Cognitive psychological approaches==
===Mental distance approaches===
Mental distance approaches {{harv|Shepard|1962}} assume that mental representations can be conceptualized as some kind of mental space. Concepts are represented as points within the space. Similarity between concepts is a function of the distance between the concepts in space. Concepts represented by points that are near to each other are more psychologically similar than are points that are conceptually distant. A strength of this approach is there are many mathematical techniques for deriving spaces from data such as [[multidimensional scaling]] {{harv|Shepard|1962}} and [[latent semantic analysis]] {{harv|Landauer|Dumais|1997}}.

===Featural approaches===
Featural approaches {{harv|Tversky|1977}} were developed to address limitations of the mental distance approaches. For example, spaces are symmetric. The distance between two points is the same regardless of which point you start from. However, psychological similarity is not symmetric. For example, we often prefer to state similarity in one direction. For example, it feels more natural to say that 101 is like 100 than to say that 100 is like 101. Furthermore, many [[metaphor]]s are also directional. Saying "That surgeon is a butcher" means something quite different from saying "That butcher is a surgeon."

Featural approaches assumed that people represent concepts by lists of features that describe properties of the items. A similarity comparison involves comparing the feature lists that represent the concepts. Features that are shared in the feature lists are ''commonalities'' of the pair and features that are contained in one feature set but not the other are ''differences'' of the pair. It is possible to account for people's intuitions or ratings of the similarities between concepts by assuming that judgments of similarity increase with the number of commonalities (weighted by the salience of those commonalities) and decreases with the number of differences (weighted by the salience of the differences).

===Structural approaches===
Structural approaches to similarity {{harv|Gentner|Markman|1997}} were developed to address limitations of the featural account. In particular, featural approaches assume that the commonalities and differences are independent of each other. However, commonalities and differences are not psychologically independent. In fact, determining the differences between a pair requires finding the commonalities. Consider the comparison between a car and a motorcycle. Both have wheels. That is a commonality. However, cars have four wheels, while motorcycles have two wheels. That is a difference. Because this difference required first finding a commonality between the pair, it is called an ''alignable difference''. Alignable differences contrast with ''nonalignable differences'' which are aspects of one concept that have no correspondence in the other. For example, cars have seatbelts and motorcycles do not. Research suggests that alignable differences have a larger impact on people's judgments of similarity than do nonalignable differences. Thus, the relationship between the commonalities of a pair and the differences is important for understanding people's assessments of similarity. Structural approaches to similarity emerged from research on [[analogy]].

===Transformational approaches===

Transformational accounts of similarity {{harv|Hahn|Chater|Richardson|2003}} were developed to evaluate similarity independently of the type of mental representation. On this view, any mental representation can be transformed into another mental representation through some series of steps. For any representation system and set of transformations, it is possible to define the shortest set of steps (i.e., the shortest program) that will transform one representation into another. The shorter this minimal program, the more similarity the pair of concepts. {{harvtxt|Larkey|Markman|2005}} found some evidence against this view, showing that the number of steps to transform the colors and shapes of geometric objects does not predict people's similarity judgments for those objects.

==Social psychological approaches==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
In [[social psychology]], ''similarity'' refers to how closely attitudes, values, interests and personality match between people. Research has consistently shown that similarity leads to [[interpersonal attraction]].

Many forms of similarity have been shown to increase liking. Similarities in opinions, interpersonal styles, amount of communication skill, demographics, and values have all been shown in experiments to increase liking.

Several explanations have been offered to explain similarity increases interpersonal attraction ([[Interpersonal attraction#Similarity (like-attracts-like)|like-prefers-like]]). First, people with similar interests tend to put themselves into similar types of settings. For example, two people interested in literature are likely to run into each other in the library and form a relationship (involving the [[propinquity effect]]). Another explanation is that we notice similar people, expect them to like us, and initiate relationships. Also, having relationships with similar people helps to validate the values held in common. Finally, people tend to make negative assumptions about those who disagree with them on fundamental issues, and hence feel repulsion.

"'''Sink the Bismark'''" (later "'''Sink the Bismarck'''") is a [[March (music)|march]] song by [[country music]] singer [[Johnny Horton]] and songwriter [[Tillman Franks]], based on the pursuit and [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|eventual sinking]] of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[battleship]] [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] in May 1941, during [[World War II]]. Horton released this song through [[Columbia Records]] in 1960, when it reached #3 on the charts. As originally released, the record label used the common misspelling "Bismark"; this error was corrected for later releases of the song. It was inspired by the 1960 British war movie ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'' and was in fact (with the producer [[John Brabourne]]'s approval) commissioned from Johnny Horton by [[20th Century Fox]]  who were worried about the subject's relative obscurity in the United States. While the song was used in U.S. theater trailers for the film, it was not used in the film itself.

==Blues Brothers recording==
The song was later recorded by [[The Blues Brothers]] for a scene in the movie, ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', but was cut out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sudo|first=Chuck|title=Friday Morning Diversion: The Blues Brothers Sing "Sink The Bismarck"|url=http://chicagoist.com/2012/07/06/friday_morning_diversion_the_blues.php|publisher=IndieWire|date=July 6, 2012|accessdate=25 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823180049/http://chicagoist.com/2012/07/06/friday_morning_diversion_the_blues.php|archivedate=23 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OSTMH-OSMTJ Timeline.jpg|thumb|A simplified chart of the various splits within the Order.]]
The '''Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem''', ({{lang-la|Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani}}, OSMTH), is a [[self-styled order]] and international NGO. OSMTH is often referred to simply as the [[Knights Templars]] but asserts no direct lineage to the original Order.

OSMTH does not officially recognize the claims laid out in the [[Larmenius Charter]] as historically valid,&lt;ref name="legacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osmth.org/tlegacy_hist.htm|title=OSMTH Templar legacy page|website=Osmth.org|accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but makes a moral and ethical claim to follow in the same spiritual path as the original Order of the Knights Templar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osmth.org/templar-legacy|title=Templar Legacy|first=Brian|last=Thomas|website=Osmth.org|accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OSMTH, which is open to Christians of any denomination, operates as a charity,&lt;ref name="Osmth brochure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osmth.org/documents/pr.pdf|title=OSMTH brochure, p. 3, 5, 6|website=Osmth.org|accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and engages in diplomatic and humanitarian works.&lt;ref name="Int.Ovr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osmth.org/documents/OSMTH%20International%20-%20Overview%20-%20V7.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725024735/http://www.osmth.org/documents/OSMTH%20International%20-%20Overview%20-%20V7.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The self-styled ''l'Ordre du Temple'', founded in France in 1705, claimed to be the continuation of the medieval [[Knights Templar]], using the Larmenius Charter as evidence of its pedigree. The order was officially reconstituted in 1804 by [[Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osmth.org/morder_hist.htm|title=OSMTH "History and Goals of the Contemporary Templar.  This is patntly incorrect as any visitor to the archives of the Cistercian Order also fouded by St. Bernard of Clairvaux, can find for theselves. Alternatively Versailles records now in the National Archives of France can attest to the emergence from secrecy of the Order under the name of Knights of the Orient.  All denials of the transfer of power to the Duke of Orleans are based on prejudice and mainly inspired by some very bizarre Masonic thoeries about all the documents leading up to the resurfacing of the Order and which they call forgeries albeit the fact that this new movement founded in 1727 by the Duke of Connaught with the necessary  help of the Scottish, much older pedigree connections, created false versions of many established orders to ensure that British citizens did not need to join "foreign" ones. Ben Johnson in his diaries mentions the Jesuits regularly entering Templar Houses- The Jesuits themselves were suppressed in 1773 for helping and assuming identity with Templars and all well before Palaprat comes to the scene. Palaprat inherited the post from the Duke of Chevrillon who had great faith in his talents and who in turn had taken it from the Duke de Brissac just before his imminent execution as head of the Royal National Guard of France. Palaprat was ousted for wild indiscretions by Chevrillon and other members of the hidden Grand Magistry.  Palaprat appeared to have been shocked by the content of some of the documents he had inherited and the Duke took the office back despite the dangers of aristicratic involvement. Palaprat took it over for a second time no doubt better versed and prepared to move on. He was prompted and aided by Church hidden hands to form a Templar Order of the Rosy Cross to take care of those aspects of the Order which could prove socially conflictive. Napoleon was well informed about its authenticity and saw in it a chance to restore some of the aristocratic families to the new Oligarchy which would come under his Imperial Crown. 

It takes little understanding to see the complexities which such moves would bring about in a post revolution France. The Templars had shared Lodging houses which were in fact teaching centres and which inspired the Masons to call their discret secret meeting places Free Houses "Franc Maisons" like the Templars did and also the term lodgings since that also refers to knowledge and eventually to living spaces for students. From outside and non initated they were merely eating houses but secret access to hidden areas were utilised for the dissemination of knowledge supressed by Church and State. Freehouses stem from these systems which in turn refer to more ancient places like "the cenacle"  without windows and where the Nassarenes met.

The Jesuits even put their motto on the 1705 Versailles Statutes which no future imagined inventor, especially masonic ones. would have thought of any value if they were set on fostering red herrings to detract value from the menace of a revived or survival of the Templar Order.   Both Templar and Jesuit Mottos are essentially of the same essence.

 Order"|website=Osmth.org|accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recognized as an Order of Chivalry by its patron Napoleon Bonaparte in 1805;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osmth.org/overview.pdf |format=PDF |title=Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem |website=Osmth.org |accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Antonio Campello Pinto de Sousa Fontes (1878-1960) claimed that the OSMTH was the continuation of ''l'Ordre du Temple'',&lt;ref name="fghoche.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fghoche.com/tribunes/chronobio.html|title=Chronologie Raymond Bernard - AMORC - Mouvements templiers|website=Fghoche.com|accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fernando Campello Pinto Pereira de Sousa Fontes (b. 1930) succeeded his father as the head of the order in 1960.&lt;ref name="fghoche.com"/&gt;

In 1970, a split occurred within the OSMTH when General Antoine Zdrojewski was unexpectedly elected as the new Grand Master of the OSMTH at the Convent of Paris in September, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]], ''The Order of The Solar Temple: The Temple of Death'', page 24 (Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2006). {{ISBN|0-7546-5285-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zdrojewski became the head of one faction of the Order, which he referred to by the French translation: "Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem" (OSMTJ), until his death in 1989. Zdrojewski was succeeded by George Lamirand as the new head of the OSMTJ until his death in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Order". Theknightstemplarorg.&lt;/ref&gt; George Lamirand was succeeded by Dr. Nicolas Haimovici Hastier who is the current OSMTJ International Leader today.&lt;ref&gt;"Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem" (OSMTJ) – Modern Order". Osmtj.net&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, OSMTH voted to expel Grand Master Fernando de Sousa Fontes from the order. This resulted in another schism with those loyal to Grand Master Fernando de Sousa Fontes forming a new organization presently known as OSMTH-Regency while the remainder of the organization continued on as OSMTH.

While OSMTH rituals and traditions are currently based upon those of the historical [[Knights Templar]], according to its website&lt;ref name="legacy" /&gt; and their present leader, Grand Master Patrick Rea,&lt;ref name="readingeagle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=182842 |title=Real Knights Templar are philanthropists |website=Readingeagle.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no direct historical lineage claimed by OSMTH and the 12th century Templars.

In 2001, the Order was accredited by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] as a [[non-governmental organisation]], in special consultative status, one of over 2,000 organizations to hold this status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/dpi/ngosection/asp/form.asp?RegID=all&amp;CnID=all&amp;AcID=-1&amp;kw=&amp;NGOID=2904|title=outreach.un.org.ngorelations|website=Un.org|accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Order is an associate member of the [[International Peace Bureau]] and an affiliate of the [[International Center for Religion &amp; Diplomacy]],&lt;ref name="Int.Ovr" /&gt; which was founded by one of OSMTH's members.&lt;ref name="Osmth brochure" /&gt; In 2014, OSMTH was elected as a board member of CoNGO (Conference of NGOs in consultative status with the United Nations.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Organisation==
The order exists in each country under different jurisdictions. In America, the OSMTH is known as the ''Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem, Inc (this being the English rendering of the Latin name).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.osmth.org/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324131657/http://us.osmth.org/|archivedate=2010-03-24|title=Wayback Machine|date=24 March 2010|publisher=|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They should not be confused with a multitude of other self-styled "Knights Templar", or the Masonic [[Knights Templar (Freemasonry)|Knights Templar]].

OSMTH is registered in Geneva, Swiss Reg No: CH-660.1.972777-4 and is in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations has over 5000 active members in Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, England &amp; Wales, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Serbia, Ukraine and in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osmth.org|title=Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani|website=Osmth.org|accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hodapp, Alice Von Kannon, ''The Templar Code for Dummies'', pages 206-207 (Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2007). {{ISBN|978-0-470-12765-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSMTH operates in a number of countries providing humanitarian aid &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osmth.org/humanitarian-projects|title=Humanitarian Projects|first=Kathy|last=Watson|website=www.osmth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the River Jordan Project that is supported by HM King Abdullah of Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osmth.org/humanitarian-projects/jordan-river-project|title=Jordan River Project|first=Kathy|last=Watson|website=www.osmth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical organization operates as a modern-day network of educated professionals.&lt;ref name="About Us" /&gt; As of August 2007, the organization had approximately 5,200 members.&lt;ref name="readingeagle.com"/&gt;

Christian men who join the organisation are self-styled as "Knights" with the title of ''[[knight|Chevalier]]'' and females are termed "Dames" with the title of ''Chevaleresse'' (or ''Chevalière'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osmth.org/documents/manual.pdf|title=OSMTH Knight's manual|page=3|website=Osmth.org|accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern Order claims over 5000 members, allegedly including leaders in the military, business, government and ecclesiastical communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osmth.org/modern-order|title=Modern Order|first=Brian|last=Thomas|website=Osmth.org|accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Order's Royal Patron, who is also a Chevalière of the Order, is Her Highness [[Prince Friedrich Ferdinand of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg|Princess Elizabeth of Ysenburg-Büdingen-Wachtersbach]] (b. 1945).  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osmth.org/about-osmth/welcoming-statements/royal-patron|title=Royal Patron|first=Brian|last=Thomas|website=Osmth.org|accessdate=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the widow of HSH Prince Ferdinand Heinrich of Ysenburg-Büdingen-Wachtersbach and the eldest daughter of [[Prince Friedrich Ferdinand of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg]] (1913-1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osmth.org/about-osmth/welcoming-statements/royal-patron|title=Royal Patron|first=Brian|last=Thomas|website=Osmth.org|accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is also the great (4) granddaughter of King [[Frederick V of Denmark]].

The Religious Patron is H.E. Archbishop Dr. Vicken Aykazain, Legate of the Eastern Diocese Armenian, Orthodox Church of America. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carpediem.osmth.org/carpe_diem_2018_win04.htm|title=Carpe Diem Winter 2018|first=Chev.

== Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ) ==
The Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ) is the American autonomous Grand Priory of the Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani (OSMTH).&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smotj.org/about_us/index.html|title=SMOTJ About Us page|website=Smotj.org|accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; branch of the Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smotj.org/about_us/international.html|title=SMOTJ About Us page, International section|website=Smotj.org|accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osmth.org/contactus.htm|title=OSMTH List of Priories|website=Osmth.org|accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SMOTJ broke with the OSMTH-Regency in 1995 when it refused to recognize the sovereignty of OSMTH-Regency Grand Master Dom Fernando de Sousa Fontes. 

This name Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ) has been trademarked and is used exclusively in America by the SMOTJ and thus does not refer to the group of organizations tracing lineage to OSMTH but rather to the current OSMTH only.

== Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem (OSMTJ) ==
The OSMTJ is split of OSMTH in 1970 after the former Grandmaster Fontes refused to obey the laws of succession when General Antoine Zdrojewski was elected.  Some of the Grand Priories, including the French, Belgian, Swiss, and Polish, followed the newly elected General Zdrojewski, and some stayed loyal to Fontes.  Alfred Zappelli (Grand Prior of Switzerland), General Georges de Bruyn (Grand Prior of Belgium), and Badouraly-Somji Alibay (Commander of the Polish Commandery)  were also backers of General Zdrojewski.  After the election of Zdrojewski, those who followed him became known as OSMTJ.  Those who continued to follow de Sousa Fontes were known as OSMTH (or “OSMTH-Regency”).  “OSMTJ” is the French acronym  for  “Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://osmtj.net/history/|title=Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem (OSMTJ)   –  History|website=osmtj.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1973, Grand Master Zdrojewski carried out a re-organization of the [[OSMTJ]] and a reform of the Statutes. He approved the Grand Priories re-asserting the independence of the International Federation of Autonomous Grand Priories of the OSMTJ (Each member Grand Priory was recognized as autonomous). The Swiss Grand Priory accepted these reformed statutes in 1973, while the Belgian and United States Grand Priories accepted them in 1975. Zdrojewski was succeeded by George Lamirand as the new head of the OSMTJ until his death in 1994.&lt;ref name="Supreme Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theknightstemplar.org/modern-order/|title=Modern Order|website=Theknightstemplarorg|accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Lamirand was succeeded by Dr. Nicolas Haimovici Hastier who is the current OSMTJ Regent today.&lt;ref name="Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osmtj.net/modern-order/|title=Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem (OSMTJ)   –  Modern Order|website=Osmtj.net|accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Chancellor work with the Regency Council at directly with the Regent General Ph.D Nicolas Hastier Haimovici for develop the Academy of study and coordination of humanitarian actions.

'''Strawberry Fair''' is a local festival of music, entertainments, arts and crafts which has been held in [[Cambridge]], [[England]], since 1974. The fair is held on [[Midsummer Common]] on the first Saturday in June. It is open to the public and free.

It has been held since 1974 except 2010, when it was cancelled due to drunkenness and drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Police-bid-ban-Strawberry-Fair/story-22489074-detail/story.html |title=Police bid to ban Strawberry Fair |website=Cambridge-news.co.uk |date=2010-02-27 |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the fair continued with a perimeter fence erected around the festival and searches to check for alcohol, drugs and weapons.

==Events==
[[Image:Cambridge Strawberry Fair 2011 stage.jpg|thumb|The [[steampunk]]-themed stage at Strawberry Fair 2011.]]

The 2011 parade was part of the UK Centre for Carnival Arts 'Carnival Crossroads' project and featured colourful costumes and samba bands. There was a Village Green area with traditional community activities such as re-enactment displays, It's A Knockout, fancy dress pageant and a grand finale. Other attractions were the Wigwam Stage, The Green Area, Kids Area, the acoustic and cabaret bar, and Colonel Maybey's Mechanical Menagerie a new 'steam diesel punk' area, in addition to around 300 stalls selling food and goods. Entry to the fair was free. As in recent years (since 2004) the fair held a free 'film night' the previous day featuring short films made by local people. The fair has a following of [[alternative lifestyle]]s.

==Music and art==
A range of musical genres are represented at the fair across several music stages. Local bands are predominantly selected to play. Children are catered for with a free and enclosed entertainments area that includes face painters, a family friendly cafe, a marquee of activities such as painting and crafts, storytelling and other attractions. An Arts area also allows local art to be displayed and for visitors to the fair to try something new.

==Organisation==

In the constitution, the object of the fair is described thus:

:"The object of the Fair shall be to hold a Fair, called Strawberry Fair, annually on Midsummer Common, Cambridge, on the first (1st) Saturday in June, for the benefit of the local community, particularly the children. The Fair shall have free entry and entertainments, including music and theatre."

The fair is run by a committee of local people who elect a Chair, Vice-Chair, Treasurer, and Secretary each year in September/October to form a Steering Group. Sub-committees also operate in order to discuss specific areas of the fair's operation, namely Programming, Finance and Admin, Policy and Community, and Site. The heads of these sub-committees report back at monthly General Meetings - weekly closer to the fair - which provides accountability and allows for the approval (or otherwise) of proposals put forward by the sub-committees.

Approximately 1000 people volunteer their time to make Strawberry Fair happen, which is seen by the committee as one of its greatest aspects. These volunteers include members of the committee itself, stewards, an environment team, area coordinators, stage managers, backstage staff, stalls co-ordinators, and many people 'behind the scenes' who undertake administration.

The fair is a free event because of volunteers. Income from stalls meets infrastructure and overhead costs. Benefit gigs are held throughout the year to raise money (for example, Strawberry Sundae&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/events/160881737930268/|title=Strawberrry Sundae|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The local bands that play these [[Gig (musical performance)|gig]]s usually also play on the day of the fair. Strawberry Fair also organise and run the Cambridge Band Competition which has been running since 1984. Heats are held each year in The Portland Arms music venue, with the final at [[Cambridge Junction]]. All finalists in the Cambridge Band Competition also get invited to play at the Fair. 

Strawberry Fair merchandise - including T-shirts, badges, programmes and posters - is also sold from Information Tents on Fair days and at benefit and band competition heats and final.

A legal dispute between [[webcomic]] ''[[The Oatmeal]]'' and content aggregator website FunnyJunk began in 2011.&lt;ref name="arstechnica2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arstechnica2012"/&gt; ''The Oatmeal'' creator [[Matthew Inman]] alleged in 2011 that FunnyJunk users repeatedly [[copyright infringement|infringed copyright]] of ''The Oatmeal''{{'}}s [[original content]]. In June 2012, FunnyJunk's lawyer, [[Charles Carreon]], sent Inman a letter demanding US$20,000 in [[damages]] from him, alleging the claims he made were [[defamatory]]. Inman responded by publishing the letter on his site, along with a response and announcement that he would be organizing a charity fundraiser through [[Indiegogo]], donating the amount demanded by Carreon to the [[American Cancer Society]] and the [[National Wildlife Federation]].

On June 15, 2012, Carreon filed a separate [[pro se]] lawsuit ''Carreon vs Inman et al'' against Inman, Indiegogo, both charities and a hundred [[John Doe|Does]] for allegations related to ''The Oatmeal''{{'}}s response and related actions by other individuals. Carreon dropped this case on July 3 of that year. ''[[Mashable]]'' named the case first among their list of "silliest tech lawsuits ever."&lt;ref name="mcclelland"&gt;McClelland, Jo (July 12, 2012). [http://mashable.com/2012/07/12/silly-tech-lawsuits/ Top 9 Silliest Tech Lawsuits Ever.] ''[[Mashable]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Carreon was also sued by the anonymous operator of a blog parodying him after Carreon sent letters to the site's web host demanding they reveal its operator.

==Background==
FunnyJunk is a website where users can upload content they find humorous. According to ''[[Ars Technica]]'', key FunnyJunk personnel are Bryan Durel and Benjamin Bunker.&lt;ref name="Anderson210717"&gt;Anderson, Nate (July 17, 2012). [https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/07/finding-the-mystery-man-behind-funnyjunk/ Finding the mystery man behind FunnyJunk.] ''[[Ars Technica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, ''The Oatmeal'' creator Matthew Inman found that FunnyJunk was distributing copies of comics from his website without permission. He sent e-mails, resulting in removal of some but not all of the comics, and subsequently discontinued attempts at removal.

In May 2011, Inman made a post on ''The Oatmeal''{{'}}s [[blog]] against FunnyJunk and contemplating a [[cease and desist]] under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] (see [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]]).&lt;ref name="arstechnica2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oatmealrant"/&gt; The FunnyJunk owner known simply as "Admin" responded with a message to all users claiming that “the Oatmeal wants to sue funnyjunk and shut it down! He thinks we're nothing more than dirty content thieves...Contact Oatmeal anyway you can!" and provided links to ''The Oatmeal''{{'}}s e-mail and [[Facebook]] page.&lt;ref name="oatmealfunnyjunk2"/&gt; This triggered spamming by FunnyJunk users and a [[flame war]] with ''The Oatmeal'' readers.&lt;ref name="arstechnica2011"/&gt;

==Operation BearLove Good, Cancer Bad==
{{Update|section|date=September 2013|needs=Conclusion to the @Charles_Carreon situation}}
In 2011/2012, FunnyJunk hired [[Charles Carreon]] to review its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/funnyjunk-lawyer-suing-the-oatmeal-cartoonist-inman-over-indiegogo-charity-drive/2012/06/18/gJQAbZhDlV_blog.html |title=FunnyJunk lawyer suing The Oatmeal cartoonist Inman over Indiegogo charity drive |last=Cavna |first=Michael |work=The Washington Post |date=June 18, 2012 |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, Carreon delivered a [[demand letter]] via [[process server]] to Matthew Inman of ''The Oatmeal'' claiming that ''The Oatmeal''{{'}}s posts regarding FunnyJunk's alleged copyright infringement constituted defamation.&lt;ref name="mashable"/&gt; The letter demanded the removal of references to FunnyJunk and US$20,000 in damages. Inman responded with a ''The Oatmeal'' blog post containing an annotated copy of the letter, and refusing to do so. Inman further proposed to raise the requisite $20,000, take a photo of himself with the cash, and send the photograph along with a satirical illustration of FunnyJunk's mother "seducing a [[Kodiak bear]]" to FunnyJunk.&lt;ref name="oatmeallawsuitcomic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="komonews" /&gt; Rather than pay the damages, Inman proposed to donate the money to two charities, the [[National Wildlife Federation]] and the [[American Cancer Society]]. This blog post elicited more popular support for Inman and ''The Oatmeal'' than anticipated, and the fundraising effort "Operation BearLove Good. Cancer Bad." generated the $20,000 in 64 minutes and over $100,000 in under 24 hours, and at completion he raised $220,024.&lt;ref name="indiegogo" /&gt; Inman also responded via counsel.&lt;ref name="scribd" /&gt; On June 21, 2012, Carreon abandoned FunnyJunk's demands because of misinformation.&lt;ref name="guardian-cartoonists"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/21/oatmeal-carreon-comics-property |title=The Oatmeal beat Funnyjunk, but other cartoonists aren't so lucky |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Bradbury |first=Daniel |date=June 21, 2012 |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stranger-comic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/win-lose-or-draw/Content?oid=13970862 |title=Local Cartoon Spat Escalates to Your Mama Jokes, Death Threats, and a Fundraiser for Wildlife |work=The Stranger |last=Bradbury |first=Danny |date=June 19, 2012 |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident spurred commentary by Dan Mitchell of ''[[SF Weekly]]'' on how the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] places the onus of policing violations on content creators&lt;ref name="sfweeklyblog" /&gt; and by Maxwell S. Kennerly Esquire of the Beasley Firm LLC on whether public accusations of copyright infringement are defamatory.&lt;ref name="litigationandtrial" /&gt;

In the aftermath of the blog post, FunnyJunk took down all pages Inman linked as infringement and Carreon sought to hide his e-mail address due to a flood of e-mail. Carreon expressed surprise, stating: "I really did not expect that he would marshal an army of people who would besiege my website and send me a string of obscene emails."&lt;ref name="msnbc"/&gt; On June 14, 2012 Carreon replaced his contact page with one saying, "Due to security attacks instigated by Matt Inman, this function has been temporarily disabled."&lt;ref name="forbes1" /&gt; Inman, however, disputed the assertion that he had instigated an attack, noting in a blog post that Carreon's contact information had been redacted from his initial comic and that he had never directed anyone to attack Carreon.&lt;ref name="oatmeal-blog-response"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theoatmeal.com/blog/carreon |title=Charles Carreon is officially suing me and the charities I'm raising money for |last=Inman |first=Matthew |work=The Oatmeal |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carreon's website, [[Twitter]] account and [[WordPress]] site were all attacked, but he says "I welcome the opportunity to confront legally the misuse of a new technology."&lt;ref name="forbes2" /&gt; Carreon is trying to identify the operator of the impostor account @Charles_Carreon by subpoenaing Twitter and [[Ars Technica]].&lt;ref name="ars-subpoena"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/06/doubling-down-funnyjunk-lawyer-to-subpoena-ars-twitter/ |title=Doubling down: FunnyJunk lawyer to subpoena Ars, Twitter |work=Ars Technica |last=Anderson |first=Nate |date=June 20, 2012 |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thier2012jun21"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2012/06/21/charles-carreon-subpoeaning-ars-technica-twitter-in-oatmeal-suit/ |title=Charles Carreon Subpoeaning Ars Technica, Twitter in Oatmeal Suit |last=Thier |first=Dave |date=June 21, 2012 |work=Forbes |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2012, the account was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.twitter.com/Charles_Carreon&lt;/ref&gt;

Carreon sent [[Indiegogo]] a request to halt Inman's charity fundraiser as a [[terms of service]] violation,&lt;ref name="msnbc"/&gt; alleging that the charities' names are misrepresented in violation of California law, and Inman will profit. Inman promised, "I won't use any of the money on legal fees."&lt;ref name="cbsnews" /&gt; and "100% of it is going to charity."&lt;ref name="indiegogo2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiegogo.com/bearlovegood?c=activity |title=BearLove Good. Cancer Bad. |work=Indiegogo |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indiegogo investigated the allegations and did not suspend the campaign.&lt;ref name="ars-indienono" /&gt;&lt;ref name="betabeat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://betabeat.com/2012/06/nice-try-funnyjunk-indiegogo-will-not-be-shutting-down-theoatmeal/ |title=Nice Try, FunnyJunk: Indiegogo Says the Oatmeal’s Fundraiser is A-Okay |work=Betabeat |publisher=The Observer |date=June 15, 2012 |last=Faircloth |first=Kelly |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Operation BearLove Good, Cancer Bad ended, Matthew Inman said that he still plans to go with his plan of taking a picture of the money, sending it to Carreon with the satirical picture, and donating the money, though now both the National Wildlife Federation and the American Cancer Society get $105,611.52 each instead of $10,000 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theoatmeal.com/blog/fundraiser_update |title=Operation BearLove Good, Cancer Bad has ended.

On June 15, 2012, Carreon filed a ''[[pro se]]'' lawsuit ''Carreon v.

'''The Smovies''' (Short + Movies) is a film competition created in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[UAE]] in April 2015 by [[BrandMoxie]]. The initiative was developed in partnership with VOX Cinemas where the winner's short film is shown as a trailer.

'''United Nations Security Council Resolution 242''' (S/RES/242) was adopted unanimously by the [[UN Security Council]] on November 22, 1967, in the aftermath of the [[Six-Day War]]. It was adopted under [[Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VI]] of the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]].&lt;ref name="SP1382"&gt;{{cite web|title=S/PV.1382 (OR)|url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/9F5F09A80BB6878B0525672300565063|work=Security Council Official Records 22nd Year|publisher=United nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was sponsored by [[United Kingdom|British]] ambassador [[Lord Caradon]] and was one of five drafts under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/9F5F09A80BB6878B0525672300565063"See|title=S/PV. 1382 Paragraph 65 for list of drafts.

The preamble&lt;ref name="Preamble definition"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/scres.htm#intro |title=United Nations Research Guide |publisher=United Nations |date=June 27, 2012 |access-date=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the "inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East in which every State in the area can live in security".

Operative Paragraph One "Affirms that the fulfillment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles:

::(i) Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict;

:: (ii) Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S/RES/242(1967) – E|url=https://undocs.org/S/RES/242(1967)|website=undocs.org|accessdate=2 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This seems to be a basic consideration, which should be discussed simply and plainly. Syria's convoluted acceptance is noted. Where is Israel's acceptance of 242? citation needed--&gt;

On 1 May 1968, the Israeli ambassador to the UN expressed Israel's position to the Security Council: "My government has indicated its acceptance of the Security Council resolution for the promotion of agreement on the establishment of a just and lasting peace. I am also authorized to reaffirm that we are willing to seek agreement with each Arab State on all matters included in that resolution."

In September 1993, the PLO agreed that Resolutions 242 and 338 should be the basis for negotiations with Israel when it signed the [[Declaration of Principles]].

Resolution 242 is one of the most widely affirmed resolutions on the Arab–Israeli conflict and formed the basis for later negotiations between the parties. These led to Peace Treaties between [[Israel–Egypt Peace Treaty|Israel and Egypt]] (1979) and [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty|Jordan]] (1994), as well as the 1993 and 1995 [[Oslo Accords|agreements with the Palestinians]].

==Context==
The resolution is the formula proposed by the Security Council for the resolution of the Arab–Israeli conflict, in particular, ending the state of belligerency then existing between the 'States concerned', [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. The resolution deals with five principles; withdrawal of Israeli forces, 'peace within secure and recognized boundaries', freedom of navigation, a just settlement of the refugee problem and security measures including demilitarized zones. It also provided for the appointment of a Special Representative to proceed to the Middle East in order to promote agreement on a peaceful and accepted settlement in accordance with the principles outlined in the resolution.

Upon presenting the draft resolution to the Security Council, the U.K. representative Lord Caradon said:

{{quote|All of us recognize that peace is the prize. None of us wishes a temporary truce or a superficial accommodation. We could never advocate a return to uneasy hostility. As I have said, my Government would never wish to be associated with any so-called settlement which was only a continuation of a false truce, and all of us without any hesitation at all can agree that we seek a settlement within the principles laid down in Article 2 of the Charter. So much for the preamble.

As to the first operative paragraph, and with due respect for fulfillment of Charter principles, we consider it essential that there should be applied the principles of both withdrawal and security, and we have no doubt that the words set out throughout that paragraph are perfectly clear.

As to the second operative paragraph, there is I believe no vestige of disagreement between us all that there must be a guarantee of freedom of navigation through international waterways. There must be a just settlement of the refugee problem. There must be a guarantee and adequate means to ensure the territorial inviolability and political independence of every State in the area.

As to the third operative paragraph, I have said before that I consider that the United Nations special representative should be free to decide himself the exact means and methods by which he pursues his endeavors in contact with the States concerned both to promote agreement and to assist efforts to achieve a peaceful and accepted and final settlement."&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/eed216406b50bf6485256ce10072f637/13e49b0f4c7ae1dc0525672b0069def4?OpenDocument 1379th Meeting of the UN Security Council] United Nations, 16 November 1967&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] commented on the most significant area of disagreement regarding the resolution:&lt;blockquote&gt;There was much bickering over whether that resolution should say from "the" territories or from "all" territories. In the French version, which is equally authentic, it says withdrawal de territory, with de meaning "the." We wanted that to be left a little vague and subject to future negotiation because we thought the Israeli border along the West Bank could be "rationalized"; certain anomalies could easily be straightened out with some exchanges of territory, making a more sensible border for all parties. We also wanted to leave open demilitarization measures in the Sinai and the Golan Heights and take a fresh look at the old city of Jerusalem. But we never contemplated any significant grant of territory to Israel as a result of the June 1967 war. On that point we and the Israelis to this day remain sharply divided. This situation could lead to real trouble in the future. Although every President since Harry Truman has committed the United States to the security and independence of Israel, I'm not aware of any commitment the United States has made to assist Israel in retaining territories seized in the Six-Day War.&lt;ref&gt;Rusk "As I Saw It", Dean and Richard Rusk, W.W. Norton, 1990, {{ISBN|0-393-02650-7}}, page 389&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A memorandum from the President's Special Assistant, [[Walt Rostow]], to President Johnson said: "What's on the Arab Ambassadors' minds boils down to one big question: Will we make good on our pledge to support the territorial integrity of all states in the Middle East? Our best answer is that we stand by that pledge, but the only way to make good on it is to have a genuine peace. The tough question is whether we'd force Israel back to 4 June borders if the Arabs accepted terms that amounted to an honest peace settlement. Secretary Rusk told the Yugoslav Foreign Minister: 'The US had no problem with frontiers as they existed before the outbreak of hostilities. If we are talking about national frontiers—in a state of peace—then we will work toward restoring them.' But we all know that could lead to a tangle with the Israelis."&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the U.S. [FRUS], 1964–1968, Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967. Document 455, Memorandum From the President's Special Assistant (Rostow) to President Johnson, Washington, October 3, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rusk met with Foreign Minister Nikezic on August 30, 1967. However, according to telegram 30825 to Belgrade, September 1, which summarizes the conversation, Rusk said the key to a settlement was to end the state of war and belligerence and that if a way could be found to deal with this, other things would fall into place; the difference between pre-June 5 positions and secure national boundaries was an important difference.

President Johnson responded to a complaint from President Tito that Israel could change the frontiers without Arab consent: "You note that the Arabs feel the US interprets the draft resolution to imply a change of frontiers to their detriment. We have no preconceptions on frontiers as such. What we believe to be important is that the frontiers be secure. For this the single most vital condition is that they be acceptable to both sides. It is a source of regret to us that the Arabs appear to misunderstand our proposal and misread our motives."&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the U.S., 1964–1968, Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967. Document 440, Letter from President Johnson to President Tito, Washington, September 15, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Secretary Rusk's Telegram dated March 2, 1968, to the U.S. Interests Section of the Spanish Embassy in Cairo summarizing Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs [[Eugene Rostow]]’s conversation with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin states:

{{quote|Rostow said ... resolution required agreement on "secure and recognized" boundaries, which, as practical matter, and as matter of interpreting resolution, had to precede withdrawals. Two principles were basic to Article I of resolution. Paragraph from which Dobrynin quoted was linked to others, and he did not see how anyone could seriously argue, in light of history of resolution in Security Council, withdrawal to borders of June 4th was contemplated. These words had been pressed on Council by Indians and others, and had not been accepted. Rusk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/johnsonlb/xx/2665.htm|title=Office of the Historian|work=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an address delivered on September 1, 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] said:

{{quote|In the pre-1967 borders Israel was barely 10 miles wide at its narrowest point. The bulk of Israel's population lived within artillery range of hostile Arab armies. I am not about to ask Israel to live that way again...

So the United States will not support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, and we will not support annexation or permanent control by Israel.

There is, however, another way to peace. The final status of these lands must, of course, be reached through the give-and-take of negotiations; but it is the firm view of the United States that self-government by the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza in association with Jordan offers the best chance for a durable, just and lasting peace.

It is the United States' position that&amp;nbsp;– in return for peace&amp;nbsp;– the withdrawal provision of Resolution 242 applies to all fronts, including the West Bank and Gaza.

When the border is negotiated between Jordan and Israel, our view on the extent to which Israel should be asked to give up territory will be heavily affected by the extent of true peace and normalization and the security arrangements offered in return.

Finally, we remain convinced that Jerusalem must remain undivided, but its final status should be decided through negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;See the Reagan Plan, September 1, 1982 https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/reaganplan.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Michael Lynk, there are three schools of thought concerning the proper legal interpretation of the withdrawal phrase.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview and analysis of the provisions and positions see
* [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1411698 Conceived in Law: The Legal Foundations of Resolution 242, Prof. Michael Lynk];
* [http://ejil.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/16/1/59 The Impact of Peremptory Norms on the Interpretation and Application of United Nations Security Council Resolutions', by Alexander Orakhelashvili, The European Journal of International Law Vol. 16 no.1]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the parties involved have suggested that the indefinite language is a “perceptible loophole”, that authorizes “territorial revision” for Israel’s benefit. Some have stated that the indefinite language was used to permit insubstantial and mutually beneficial alterations to the 1949 armistices lines, but that unilateral annexation of the captured territory was never authorized. Other parties have said that no final settlement obtained through force or the threat of force could be considered valid. They insist that the Security Council cannot create loopholes in peremptory norms of international law or the UN Charter, and that any use of indefinite language has to be interpreted in line with the overriding legal principles regarding the “inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war” and the prohibitions on mass deportations or displacement in connection with the settlement of the refugee problem.

Alexander Orakhelashvili says that the Security Council manifestly lacks the competence to validate agreements imposed through coercion, not least because the peremptory prohibition of the use of force is a limitation on the Council’s powers and the voidness of coercively imposed treaties is the clear consequence of jus cogens and the conventional law as reflected in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.&lt;ref&gt;supra Orakhelashvili, page 74&lt;/ref&gt; A recent South African study concluded that the ultimate status and boundaries will require negotiation between the parties, according to Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The same study also found that the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention which govern ‘special agreements’ that can adversely affect the rights of protected persons precludes any change in status of the territory obtained through an agreement concluded during a state of belligerent occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa: "Occupation, Colonialism, Apartheid" [http://www.hsrc.ac.za/HSRC_Review-News-28.phtml#84]&lt;/ref&gt;

John McHugo says that by the 1920s, international law no longer recognized that a state could acquire title to territory by conquest.&lt;ref name="McHugo"&gt;[http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/publications/full/bsb8-4_mchugo.pdf 'Resolution 242&amp;nbsp;– Why The Israeli View Of The "Withdrawal Phrase" Is Unsustainable In International Law, by John McHugo]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations requires all members to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/unchart.htm#art2 |title=The Avalon Project : United Nations Charter; June 26, 1945 |work=yale.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421122334/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/unchart.htm |archivedate=April 21, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Lynk says that article 2 of the Charter embodied a prevailing legal principle that there could be "no title by conquest". He says that principle had been expressed through numerous international conferences, doctrines and treaties since the late 19th Century. Lynk cites the examples of the First International Conference of American States in 1890; the United States Stimson Doctrine of 1932; the 1932 League of Nations resolution on Japanese aggression in China; the Buenos Aires Declaration of 1936; and the Atlantic Charter of 1941.&lt;ref name="Lynk"&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1411698|title=Conceived in Law: The Legal Foundations of Resolution 242|work=ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surya Sharma says that a war in self-defense cannot result in acquisition of title by conquest. He says that even if a war is lawful in origin it cannot exceed the limits of legitimate self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;Territorial acquisition, disputes, and international law, By Surya Prakash Sharma, Springer, 1997, {{ISBN|90-411-0362-7}}, page 147, and footnote 468&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land for peace===
{{Main|Land for peace}}
The resolution also calls for the implementation of the "[[land for peace]]" formula, calling for Israeli withdrawal from "territories" it had occupied in 1967 in exchange for peace with its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5ROlQUFZIpoC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;lpg=PA308&amp;dq=%22land+for+peace%22+242&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wkd_hUpGIj&amp;sig=2u23AVqb532Hy6buJn6_xC2S3Rs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BXKySuauMsiK_Abz5qXMDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=%22land%20for%20peace%22%20242&amp;f=false ''The United Nations Security Council and war: the evolution of thought and practice since 1945''] by Vaughan Lowe, Adam Roberts, Jennifer Welsh, Oxford University Press US, 2008, {{ISBN|0199533431}}, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; This was an important advance at the time, considering that there were no peace treaties between any Arab state and Israel until the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]] of 1979. "Land for peace" served as the basis of the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty, in which Israel withdrew from the [[Sinai peninsula]] (Egypt withdrew its claims to the [[Gaza Strip]] in favor of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]]). Jordan renounced its claims regarding the [[West Bank]] in favor of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], and has signed the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]] in 1994, that established the [[Jordan River]] as the boundary of Jordan.

Throughout the 1990s, there were Israeli-Syrian negotiations regarding a normalization of relations and an Israeli withdrawal from the [[Golan Heights]]. But a peace treaty was not made, mainly due to Syria's desire to recover and retain 25 square kilometers of territory in the Jordan River Valley which it seized in 1948 and occupied until 1967. As the United Nations recognizes only the 1948 borders, there is little support for the Syrian position outside the Arab bloc nor in resolving the Golan Heights issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID%3D5512 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213155049/http://thedailynewsegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=5512 |archivedate=February 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN resolution does not specifically mention the Palestinians. The United Kingdom had recognized the union between the West Bank and Transjordan.&lt;ref&gt;See Jordan and Israel (GOVERNMENT DECISION) HC Deb 27 April 1950 vol 474 cc1137-41 [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1950/apr/27/jordan-and-israel-government-decision]&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Caradon said that the parties assumed that withdrawal from occupied territories as provided in the resolution was applicable to East Jerusalem. "Nevertheless so important is the future of Jerusalem that it might be argued that we should have specifically dealt with that issue in the 1967 Resolution. It is easy to say that now, but I am quite sure that if we had attempted to raise or settle the question of Jerusalem as a separate issue at that time our task in attempting to find a unanimous decision would have been far greater if not impossible."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Judge Higgins of the International Court of Justice explained "from Security Council resolution 242 (1967) through to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1515|Security Council Resolution 1515]] (2003), the key underlying requirements have remained the same&amp;nbsp;– that Israel is entitled to exist, to be recognized, and to security, and that the Palestinian people are entitled to their territory, to exercise self-determination, and to have their own State. Security Council resolution 1515 (2003)
envisages that these long-standing obligations are to be secured (...) by negotiation"&lt;ref&gt;See the Judgment in "Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory" [http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1681.pdf SEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE HIGGINS (page 79)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112025712/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1681.pdf |date=2011-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] told the U.N. Security Council: "We simply do not support the description of the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 as 'Occupied Palestinian Territory'. In the view of my Government, this language could be taken to indicate sovereignty, a matter which both Israel and the PLO have agreed must be decided in negotiations on the final status of the territories. "Had this language appeared in the operative paragraphs of the resolution, let me be clear: we would have exercised our veto. In fact, we are today voting against a resolution in the Commission on the Status of Women precisely because it implies that Jerusalem is "occupied Palestinian territory".&lt;ref&gt;See Security Council minutes 3351st Meeting, Friday, 18 March 1994, S/PV.3351&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palestinians were represented by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] in negotiations leading to the [[Oslo Accords]]. They envisioned a 'permanent settlement based on Security Council Resolution 242'.&lt;ref&gt;The Oslo Accords: international law and the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements, By Geoffrey R. Watson, Oxford University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-19-829891-9}}, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; The main premise of the Oslo Accords was the eventual creation of Palestinian autonomy in some or all of the territories captured during the Six-Day War, in return for Palestinian recognition of Israel. However, the Foreign Minister of the Palestinian Authority, [[Nabil Shaath]], said: "Whether a state is announced now or after liberation, its borders must be those of 4 June 1967. We will not accept a state without borders or with borders based on UN Resolution 242, which we believe is no longer suitable. On the contrary, Resolution 242 has come to be used by Israel as a way to procrastinate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=12733|title=IMRA – Monday, July 8, 2002 PA Minister Nabeel Shaath: Right of return and removal of all|work=imra.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Security Council subsequently adopted resolution 1515 (2003), which recalled resolution 242 and endorsed the [[Road map for peace|Middle East Quartet’s Road Map]] towards a permanent, two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Quartet Plan calls for direct, bilateral negotiations as part of a comprehensive resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, on the basis of UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1397|1397]], 1515, 1850, and the Madrid principles. The Quartet has reiterated that the only viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement that ends the occupation that began in 1967; resolves all permanent status issues as previously defined by the parties; and fulfils the aspirations of both parties for independent homelands through two states for two peoples, Israel and an independent, contiguous and viable state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Statement by the Quartet, Office of the Spokesman, Washington, DC, September 24, 2009 [https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/sept/129602.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 2004, US President George W. Bush said to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, "The United States reiterates its steadfast commitment to Israel's security, including secure, defensible borders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defensibleborders.org|title=Defensible Borders for a Lasting Peace|work=defensibleborders.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli officials argue that the pre-1967 armistice line is not a defensible border, since Israel would be nine miles wide at the thinnest point, subjected to rocket fire from the highlands of the West Bank, and unable to stop smuggling from Jordan across the Jordan Valley. Thus, Israeli officials have been arguing for the final-status borders to be readjusted to reflect security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[Amridor, Yaakov. Israel’s Requirement for Defensible Borders] http://www.defensibleborders.org/db_amidrorb.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718033859/http://www.defensibleborders.org/db_amidrorb.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resolution 1860 (2009) recalled resolution 242 and stressed that the [[Gaza Strip]] constitutes an integral part of the territory occupied in 1967 that will be a part of the Palestinian state.

===Settlement of the refugee problem===
The resolution advocates a "just settlement of the refugee problem". Lord Caradon said "It has been said that in the Resolution we treated Palestinians only as refugees, but this is unjustified. We provided that Israel should withdraw from occupied territories and it was together with that requirement for a restoration of Arab territory that we also called for a settlement of the refugee problem."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Upon the adoption of Resolution 242, French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] stressed this principle during a press conference on November 27, 1967, and confirmed it in his letter of January 9, 1968, to [[David Ben-Gurion]]. De Gaulle cited "the pitiful condition of the Arabs who had sought refuge in Jordan or were relegated to Gaza" and stated that provided Israel withdrew her forces, it appeared it would be possible to reach a solution "within the framework of the United Nations that included the assurance of a dignified and fair future for the refugees and minorities in the Middle East."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/01/10/archives/text-of-de-gaulles-answer-to-letter-from-bengurion.html?sq=de+Gaulle+dignified+minorities&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p | work=The New York Times | title=Text of de Gaulle's Answer to Letter From Ben-Gurion | date=January 10, 1968 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Orakhelashvili said that ‘Just settlement’ can only refer to a settlement guaranteeing
the return of displaced Palestinians. He explained that it must be presumed that the Council did not adopt decisions that validated mass deportation or displacement, since expulsion or deportation are crimes against humanity or an exceptionally serious war crime.&lt;ref&gt;supra, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

According to M. Avrum Ehrlich, 'Resolution 242 called for "a just solution to the refugee problem," a term covering Jewish refugees from Arab countries as stated by President Carter in 1978 at Camp David'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PF9_EG3VaaUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT411#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of the Jewish Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture], Publisher ABC-CLIO, 2008, {{ISBN|1-85109-873-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[John Quigley (academic)|John Quigley]], however, it is clear from the context in which it was adopted, and from the statements recounted by the delegates, that Resolution 242 contemplates the Palestine Arab refugees only.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. XXXVII, No. 1 (Autumn 2007), pp. 49–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Complicating the issue, [[Arthur Goldberg]], one of the key drafters of the final language present in the resolution, pointed out that the language intentionally refers to both Jewish and Arab refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mefacts.com/cached.asp?x_id=10789 |title=Resolution 242 After Twenty Years |first=Arthur J. |last=Goldberg |date=1988 |accessdate=21 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203052019/http://www.mefacts.com/cached.asp?x_id=10789 |archive-date=3 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French version vs. English version of text==
The English version of the clause:&lt;blockquote&gt;Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict&lt;/blockquote&gt;is given in French as:{{quote|Retrait des forces armées israéliennes des territoires occupés lors du récent conflit.}}

The difference between the two versions lies in the absence of a definite article ("the") in the English version, while the word "des" present in the French version in the expression "des territoires occupés" can only mean "from the occupied territories" (the "des" in front of "territoires occupés" can only be the contraction "from the" because of the use of the word "retrait" which entails an object – "des forces israéliennes" where the "des" is the contraction of "of the" (of the Israeli forces) and a location "des territoires occupés" where the "des" is the contraction of "from the" (from the occupied territories)). If the meaning of "from some occupied territories" were intended, the only way to say so in French would have been "'''de''' territoires occupés".

Although some have dismissed the controversy by suggesting that the use of the word "des" in the French version is a translation error and should therefore be ignored in interpreting the document, the debate has retained its force since both versions are of equal legal force, as [[Official languages of the United Nations|recognized languages]] of the United Nations and in international law.

[[Solicitor]] [[John McHugo]], a [[partnership|partner]] at [[Trowers &amp; Hamlins]] and a visiting fellow at the Scottish Centre for International Law at [[Edinburgh University]], draws a comparison to phrases such as:

{{quote|Dogs must be kept on the lead near ponds in the park.}}

In spite of the lack of definite articles, according to McHugo, it is clear that such an instruction cannot legitimately be taken to imply that some dogs need not be kept on the lead or that the rule applies only near some ponds. Further, McHugo points out a potential consequence of the logic employed by advocates of a "some" reading. Paragraph 2 (a) of the resolution, which guarantees "freedom of navigation through international waterways in the area," may allow Arab states to interfere with navigation through ''some'' international waterways of their choosing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beba.org.eg/resources/cvs/JohnMcHugo%20.asp John McHugo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060108105519/http://www.beba.org.eg/resources/cvs/JohnMcHugo%20.asp |date=2006-01-08 }}, [http://www.nad-plo.org/nego/permanent/borders/related/McHugo.pdf Resolution 242: A Legal Reappraisal of the Right-Wing Israeli Interpretation of the Withdrawal Phrase With Reference to the Conflict Between Israel and the Palestinians] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524095037/http://www.nad-plo.org/nego/permanent/borders/related/McHugo.pdf |date=2005-05-24 }}, ''International and Comparative Law Quarterly'', October 2002, vol 51, pp. 858–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glenn Perry asserts that because the French version resolves ambiguities in the English text, and is more consistent with the other clauses of the treaty, it is the correct interpretation. He argues that "it is an accepted rule that the various language versions must be considered together, with the ambiguities of one version elucidated by the other".&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Glenn, Security Council Resolution 242: The Withdrawal Clause, Middle East Journal, 31:4 (1977:Autumn) p.413-433:431&lt;/ref&gt; He cites Article 33 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], which states that except when a treaty provides that one text shall prevail "the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted".&lt;ref&gt;Article 33 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], cited in Glenn Perry, Security Council Resolution 242: The Withdrawal Clause, Middle East Journal, 31:4 (1977:Autumn) p.413-433:420&lt;/ref&gt; He furthermore argues that the context of the passage, in a treaty that reaffirms "'territorial integrity', 'territorial inviolability,' and 'the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war' – taken together cannot be reconciled with anything less than full withdrawal".&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Glenn, Security Council Resolution 242: The Withdrawal Clause, Middle East Journal, 31:4 (1977:Autumn) p.413-433:420&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the reference to "secure and recognized borders" can be interpreted in several ways, and only one of them contradicts the principle of full withdrawal.

[[Shabtai Rosenne]], former Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations Office at Geneva and member of the UN's [[International Law Commission]], notes that:
{{quote|It is a historical fact, which nobody has ever attempted to deny, that the negotiations between the members of the Security Council, and with the other interested parties, which preceded the adoption of that resolution, were conducted on the basis of English texts, ultimately consolidated in Security Council document S/8247. [...] Many experts in the French language, including academics with no political axe to grind, have advised that the French translation is an accurate and idiomatic rendering of the original English text, and possibly even the only acceptable rendering into French. [...] [o]n the question of concordance, the French representative [to the 1379th meeting of the Security Council on November 16, 1967] was explicit in stating that the French text was "identical" with the English text.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenne, Shabtai.

John Norton Moore (Princeton University Press, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;!-- As of June 2009, the word "los" is still in the Spanish version of the resolution, which can be accessed at http://www.un.org/spanish/docs/sc67/scres67.htm
He also states:
{{quote|It is known from an outside source that the sponsors resisted all attempts to insert words such as "all" or "the" in the text of this phrase in the English text of the resolution, and it will not be overlooked that when that very word "all" erroneously crept into the Spanish translation of the draft, it was subsequently removed.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenne cites Arthur Lall, ''The U.N. and the Middle East Crisis'' (1968) at 253–4. Rosenne states "Ambassador Lall had earlier been Deputy Permanent Representative of India to the United Nations, and although in 1967 he held a teaching post at Columbia University, in the City of New York, he is widely regarded as reflecting the views of the Indian delegation, which at that time was a member of the Security Council.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
--&gt;
Only English and French were the Security Council's working languages (Arabic, Russian, Spanish and Chinese were official but not the working languages).

The [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America]] argues the practice at the UN is that the binding version of any resolution is the one voted upon. In the case of 242 that version was in English, so they assert the English version the only binding one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_article=196&amp;x_context=2|title=CAMERA: BACKGROUNDER: Camp David 2000|work=camera.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[David A. Korn]] asserts that this was indeed the position held by the United States and United Kingdom:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;both the British and the Americans pointed out that 242 was a British resolution; therefore, the English language text was authoritative and would prevail in any dispute over interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Korn, "The Making of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242" (Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, 1992), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The French representative to the Security Council, in the debate immediately after the vote, asserted (in the official translation from French):

{{quote|sign=|source=|the French text, which is equally authentic with the English, leaves no room for any ambiguity, since it speaks of withdrawal "des territoires occupés," which indisputably corresponds to the expression "occupied territories". We were likewise gratified to hear the United Kingdom representative stress the link between this paragraph of his resolution and the principle of inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories by force...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/db942872b9eae454852560f6005a76fb/9f5f09a80bb6878b0525672300565063!OpenDocument|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225185221/http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/db942872b9eae454852560f6005a76fb/9f5f09a80bb6878b0525672300565063!OpenDocument|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 February 2006|title=S/PV.1382 of 22 November 1967|author=|date=25 February 2006|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Opponents of the "all territories" reading remind that the UN Security Council declined to adopt a draft resolution, including the definite article, far prior to the adoption of Resolution 242. They argue that, in interpreting a resolution of an international organization, one must look to the process of the negotiation and adoption of the text. This would make the text in English, the language of the discussion, take precedence.

==The negotiating and drafting process==
A Congressional Research Service (CRS) Issue Brief quotes policy statements made by President Johnson in a speech delivered on September 10, 1968, and by Secretary of State Rogers in a speech delivered on December 9, 1969: "The United States has stated that boundaries should be negotiated and mutually recognized, 'should not reflect the weight of conquest,' and that adjustments in the pre-1967 boundaries should be 'insubstantial.'"&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Research Service, Palestinians and Middle East Peace: Issues for the United States Updated July 17, 2002 [https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/12406.pdf]; The Rogers Plan [http://www.bitterlemons.org/docs/rogers.html]; and Address by President Johnson, September 10, 1968, 59 Department of State Bulletin 348, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

President Carter asked for a State Department report "to determine if there was any justice to the Israeli position that the resolution did not include all the occupied territories". The State Department report concluded:&lt;blockquote&gt;Support for the concept of total withdrawal was widespread in the Security Council, and it was only through intensive American efforts that a resolution was adopted which employed indefinite language in the withdrawal clause. In the process of obtaining this result, the United States made clear to the Arab states and several other members of the Security Council that the United States envisioned only insubstantial revisions of the 1949 armistice lines. Israel did not protest the approach.&lt;ref name="Nina J 1967"&gt;State Department Study of the Meaning of Resolution 242, by Nina J. Noring of the Office of the Historian, and Walter B. Smith II, Director of the Office of Israeli and Arab-Israeli Affairs, Department of State, ''The Withdrawal Clause in UN Security Council Resolution 242 of 1967, Its Legislative History and the Attitudes of the United States and Israel since 1967'', February 4, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=neff&gt;The Clinton Administration and UN Resolution 242, by Donald Neff, Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 23, No. 2 (Winter, 1994), pp. 20–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ruth Lapidoth describes the view, adopted by Israel, which holds that the resolution allowed Israel to retain "some territories". She argues "The provision on the establishment of “secure and recognized boundaries” would have been meaningless if there had been an obligation to withdraw from all the territories.&lt;ref&gt;See Security Council Resolution 242: An Analysis of its Main Provisions, Prof. Ruth Lapidoth [http://www.jcpa.org/text/resolution242-lapidoth.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] recalled the first time he heard someone invoke "the sacramental language of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, mumbling about the need for a just and lasting peace within secure and recognized borders". He said the phrase was so platitudinous that he thought the speaker was pulling his leg. Kissinger said that, at that time, he did not appreciate how the flood of words used to justify the various demands obscured rather than illuminated the fundamental positions. Kissinger said those "clashing perspectives" prevented any real bargaining and explained:
{{quote|Jordan’s acquiescence in Resolution 242 had been obtained in 1967 by the promise of our United Nations Ambassador Arthur Goldberg that under its terms we would work for the return of the West Bank of Jordan with minor boundary rectifications and that we were prepared to use our influence to obtain a role for Jordan in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;White House Years, by Henry Kissinger, Little, Brown and Company, {{ISBN|0316496618}} (1979), Pages 341–345&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, speaking to Henry Kissinger, President [[Richard Nixon]] said "You and I both know they can’t go back to the other [1967] borders. But we must not, on the other hand, say that because the Israelis win this war, as they won the '67 War, that we just go on with status quo. It can't be done." Kissinger replied "I couldn't agree more"&lt;ref&gt;Crisis: the anatomy of two major foreign policy crises, By Henry Kissinger, (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2003), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, President [[Gerald Ford]] said: "The U.S. further supports the position that a just and lasting peace, which remains our objective, must be acceptable to both sides. The U.S. has not developed a final position on the borders. Should it do so it will give great weight to Israel's position that any peace agreement with Syria must be predicated on Israel remaining on the Golan Heights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/ford_rabin_letter.html|title=President Ford Letter to Israeli Prime Minister Rabin (September 1975)|author=|date=|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Secretary of State [[George Shultz]] declared: "Israel will never negotiate from, or return to, the lines of partition or to the 1967 borders."
Secretary of State [[Warren Christopher|Christopher]]'s letter to Netanyahu states: "I would like to reiterate our position that Israel is entitled to secure and defensible borders, which should be directly negotiated and agreed with its neighbors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defensibleborders.org/db_goldb.pdf|title=Jerusalem International Postal Service – Jerusalem Center For Peace|author=|date=|website=www.defensibleborders.org|accessdate=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813020344/http://www.defensibleborders.org/db_goldb.pdf|archive-date=13 August 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key part of the case in favour of a "some territories" reading is the claim that British and American officials involved in the drafting of the resolution omitted the definite article deliberately in order to make it less demanding on the Israelis. As [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]], British Foreign Secretary in 1967, said:

{{quote|The Israelis had by now annexed de facto, if not formally, large new areas of Arab land, and there were now very many more Arab refugees. It was clear that what Israel or at least many of her leaders, really wanted was permanently to colonize much of this newly annexed Arab territory, particularly the Jordan valley, Jerusalem, and other sensitive areas. This led me into a flurry of activity at the United Nations, which resulted in the near miracle of getting the famous resolution&amp;nbsp;– Resolution 242&amp;nbsp;– unanimously adopted by the Security Council. It declares "the inadmissibility of territory by war" and it also affirms the necessity "for guaranteeing the territorial inviolability and political independence of every state in the area". It calls for "withdrawal of Israeli forces from territories occupied during the recent conflict." It does not call for Israeli withdrawal from “the” territories recently occupied, nor does it use the word “all”. It would have been impossible to get the resolution through if either of these words had been included, but it does set out the lines on which negotiations for a settlement must take place. Each side must be prepared to give up something: the resolution doesn’t attempt to say precisely what, because that is what negotiations for a peace-treaty must be about.&lt;ref&gt;In My Way, George Brown Memoirs, by George Brown, St. Martins Press New York, 1971, page 233&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Hugh Foot, Baron Caradon|Lord Caradon]], chief author of the resolution, takes a subtly different slant. His focus seems to be that the lack of a definite article is intended to deny permanence to the "unsatisfactory" [[Green Line (Israel)|pre-1967 border]], rather than to allow Israel to retain land taken by force. Such a view would appear to allow for the possibility that the borders could be varied through negotiation:

{{quote|Knowing as I did the unsatisfactory nature of the 1967 line I was not prepared to use wording in the Resolution which would have made that line permanent. Nevertheless it is necessary to say again that the overriding principle was the "inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war" and that meant that there could be no justification for annexation of territory on the Arab side of the 1967 line merely because it had been conquered in the 1967 war. The sensible way to decide permanent "secure and recognized" boundaries would be to set up a Boundary Commission and hear both sides and then to make impartial recommendations for a new frontier line, bearing in mind, of course, the "inadmissibility" principle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The purposes are perfectly clear, the principle is stated in the preamble, the necessity for withdrawal is stated in the operative section. And then the essential phrase which is not sufficiently recognized is that withdrawal should take place to secure and recognized boundaries, and these words were very carefully chosen: they have to be secure and they have to be recognized. They will not be secure unless they are recognized. And that is why one has to work for agreement. This is essential. I would defend absolutely what we did. It was not for us to lay down exactly where the border should be. I know the 1967 border very well. It is not a satisfactory border, it is where troops had to stop in 1948, just where they happened to be that night, that is not a permanent boundary...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&amp;x_outlet=118&amp;x_article=1267 Security Council Resolution 242 According to its Drafters] CAMERA, January 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Arthur J. Goldberg]], another of the resolution's drafters, concurred that Resolution 242 does not dictate the extent of the withdrawal, and added that this matter should be negotiated between the parties:

{{quote|Does Resolution 242 as unanimously adopted by the UN Security Council require the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from all of the territories occupied by Israel during the 1967 war? The answer is no. In the resolution, the words the and all are omitted. Resolution 242 calls for the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the 1967 conflict, without specifying the extent of the withdrawal. The resolution, therefore, neither commands nor prohibits total withdrawal.

If the resolution is ambiguous, and purposely so, on this crucial issue, how is the withdrawal issue to be settled? By direct negotiations between the concerned parties. Resolution 242 calls for agreement between them to achieve a peaceful and accepted settlement. Agreement and acceptance necessarily require negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&amp;x_outlet=118&amp;x_article=1267 "Security Council Resolution 242 According to its Drafters,"] CAMERA, January 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mr. [[Michael Stewart, Baron Stewart of Fulham|Michael Stewart]], Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, in a reply to a question in Parliament, 9 December 1969: "As I have explained before, there is reference, in the vital United Nations Security Council Resolution, both to withdrawal from territories and to secure and recognized boundaries. As I have told the House previously, we believe that these two things should be read concurrently and that the omission of the word 'all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate."

Mr. [[Joseph J. Sisco]], Assistant Secretary of State, 12 July 1970 (NBC "Meet the Press"): "That Resolution did not say 'withdrawal to the pre-June 5 lines'. The Resolution said that the parties must negotiate to achieve agreement on the so-called final secure and recognized borders. In other words, the question of the final borders is a matter of negotiations between the parties." Mr. Sisco was actively involved in drafting the resolution in his capacity as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs in 1967.

President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]:

{{quote|Fifth, the crisis underlines the importance of respect for political independence and territorial integrity of all the states of the area. We reaffirmed that principle at the height of this crisis. We reaffirm it again today on behalf of all.

This principle can be effective in the Middle East only on the basis of peace between the parties. The nations of the region have had only fragile and violated truce lines for 20 years. What they now need are recognized boundaries and other arrangements that will give them security against terror, destruction, and war.

There are some who have urged, as a single, simple solution, an immediate return to the situation as it was on June 4. As our distinguished and able Ambassador, Mr. Arthur Goldberg, has already said, this is not a prescription for peace but for renewed hostilities. Certainly troops must be withdrawn, but there must also be recognized rights of national life, progress in solving the refugee problem, freedom of innocent maritime passage, limitation of the arms race, and respect for political independence and territorial integrity."&lt;ref&gt;Address at the State Department's Foreign Policy Conference for Educators, June 19, 1967 [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=28308]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===U.S. position===
On June 19, 1967, President Johnson declared the five principles, including land for peace, that he believed comprised the components of any United Nations settlement of the Middle East crisis. He pledged the U.S. Government would "do its part for peace in every forum, at every level, at every hour".&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967, pages 520–523, Document numbers [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d308 308] and [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d309 309]&lt;/ref&gt; On July 12, 1967, Secretary of State Rusk announced that the U.S. position on the Near East crisis was outlined in the President's statement of June 19 and that it provided the basis for a just and equitable settlement between the Arab states and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967, page 637, Document number [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d354 354]&lt;/ref&gt; On August 16, 1967, the Israeli Foreign Office stated that Israel agreed with the principles set forth by the President on June 19 and indicated that no resolution would be acceptable if it deviated from them.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967, page 726, Document number [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d420 420]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 1967, Israeli Foreign Minister Eban assured Arthur Goldberg, US Ambassador to the UN, that Israel was not seeking territorial aggrandizement and had no "colonial" aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967, page 386, Document number [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d227 227]&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of State Rusk stressed to the Government of Israel that no settlement with Jordan would be accepted by the world community unless it gave Jordan some special position in the Old City of Jerusalem. The US also assumed Jordan would receive the bulk of the West Bank as that was regarded as Jordanian territory.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967, page 765-766, Document [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d411 411]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 1967, Ambassador Goldberg, accompanied by Mr. Sisco and Mr. Pedersen, called on King Hussein of Jordan. Goldberg said the US was committed to the principle of political independence and territorial integrity and was ready to reaffirm it bilaterally and publicly in the Security Council resolution. Goldberg said the US believes in territorial integrity, withdrawal, and recognition of secure boundaries. Goldberg said the principle of territorial integrity has two important sub-principles: there must be a withdrawal to recognized and secure frontiers for all countries, not necessarily the old armistice lines, and there must be mutuality in adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967, Page 981, Document [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d501 501]&lt;/ref&gt;

Walt Rostow advised President Johnson that Secretary Rusk had explained to Mr. Eban that US support for secure permanent frontiers does not mean the US supports territorial changes.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967, Page 942, Document [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d487 487]&lt;/ref&gt; The record of a meeting between Under Secretary of State Eugene Rostow and Israeli Ambassador Harmon stated that Rostow made clear the US view that there should be movement from General Armistice Agreements to conditions of peace and that this would involve some adjustments of armistice lines as foreseen in the Armistice Agreements. Rostow told Harmon that he had already stressed to Foreign Minister Eban that the US expected the thrust of the settlement would be toward security and demilitarization arrangements rather than toward major changes in the Armistice lines. Harmon said the Israeli position was that Jerusalem should be an open city under unified administration but that the Jordanian interest in Jerusalem could be met through arrangements including "sovereignty". Rostow said the US government assumed (and Harman confirmed) that despite public statements to the contrary, the Government of Israel position on Jerusalem was that which Eban, Harman, and Evron had given several times, that Jerusalem was negotiable.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign relations of the United States, 1964–1968, Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967 Arab-Israeli Dispute, page 996, Document [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d505 505]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambassador Goldberg briefed King Hussein on US assurances regarding territorial integrity. Goldberg said the US did not view Jordan as a country that consisted only of the East Bank, and that the US was prepared to support a return of the West Bank to Jordan with minor boundary rectifications. The US would use its influence to obtain compensation to Jordan for any territory it would be required to give up. Finally, although as a matter of policy the US did not agree with Jordan's position on Jerusalem, nor with the Israeli position on Jerusalem, the US was prepared to use its influence to obtain for Jordan a role in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964–1968, Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967, Page 998, Document [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d506 506]&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary Rusk advised President Johnson that he confirmed Goldberg's pledge regarding territorial integrity to King Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign relations of the United States, 1964–1968, Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967, page 1012, Document [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d513 513]&lt;/ref&gt;

During a subsequent meeting between President Johnson, King Hussein, and Secretary of State Rusk, Hussein said the phrasing of the resolution calling for withdrawal from occupied territories could be interpreted to mean that the Egyptians should withdraw from Gaza and the Jordanians should withdraw from the West Bank. He said this possibility was evident from a speech given by Prime Minister Eshkol in which it had been claimed that both Gaza and the West Bank had been "occupied territory". The President agreed, and promised he would talk to Ambassador Goldberg about inserting Israel in that clause. Ambassador Goldberg told King Hussein that after taking into account legitimate Arab concerns and suggestions, the US would be willing to add the word "Israeli" before "Armed Forces" in the first operative paragraph.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964–1968, Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967, Page 1015, Document [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d515 515] and Page 1026, Document [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d521 521]&lt;/ref&gt;

A State Department study noted that when King Hussein met on 8 November with President Johnson, who had been briefed by Secretary Rusk on the US interpretation, the Jordanian monarch asked how soon the Israeli troops would withdraw from most of the occupied lands. The President replied "In six months."&lt;ref name="Nina J 1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name=neff/&gt;

William Quandt wrote about Johnson's meeting with Eban on October 24, 1967, and noted that Israel had annexed East Jerusalem. He said Johnson forcefully told Eban he thought Israel had been unwise when it went to war and that he still thought they were unwise. The President stressed the need to respect the territorial integrity of the Arab states. Quandt said "'The President wished to caution the Israelis that the further they get from June 5 the further they get from peace.' Meaning the more territory they insisted on holding beyond the 1967 lines, the worse would be the odds of getting a peace agreement with the Arabs."&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the US, 1964–1968, Vol. XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967 pp 944–948; William B. Quandt, Peace Process: American diplomacy and the Arab-Israeli conflict since 1967, Brookings Institution Press and the University of California Press, 3rd edition, 2005, {{ISBN|0-520-24631-4}}, page 443&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
Israel interprets Resolution 242 as calling for withdrawal from territories as part of a negotiated peace and full diplomatic recognition. The extent of withdrawal would come as a result of comprehensive negotiations that led to durable peace not before Arabs start to meet their own obligations under Resolution 242.&lt;ref name="mfa.gov.il"&gt;Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs&amp;nbsp;– The State of Israel. (2008). [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1947-1974/28%20The%20Jarring%20initiative%20and%20the%20response-%208%20Febr The War of Attrition and Cease Fire: The Jarring initiative and the response, 8 February 1971]. In ''Israel's Foreign relations: Selected Documents''. Volumes 1–2, 1947–1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the resolution was accepted by Egypt, Jordan and Israel but not by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Bayliss|title=How Israel was won: a concise history of the Arab-Israeli conflict|publisher=Lexington Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6T_Ff6Ra57sC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=resolution+242+israel+egypt+jordan#v=onepage&amp;q=resolution%20242&amp;f=false|date=1999-06-15|pages=191|accessdate=2009-10-03 | isbn=978-0-7391-0064-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab position was initially that the resolution called for Israel to withdraw from all the territory it occupied during the Six-Day War prior to peace agreements.

Israel and the Arab states have negotiated before the Israeli withdrawal. Israel and Jordan made peace without Israel withdrawing from the West Bank, since Jordan had already renounced its claims and recognized the PLO as the sole representative of the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/306128/Jordan/23336/Renouncing-claims-to-the-West-Bank|title=Jordan|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt began negotiations before Israel withdrew from the Sinai.&lt;ref name="mfa.gov.il"/&gt; Negotiations ended without Egypt ever resuming control of the Gaza Strip, which Egypt held until 1967.&lt;ref name="mfa.gov.il"/&gt;

Supporters of the "Palestinian viewpoint" focus on the phrase in the resolution's preamble emphasizing the "inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war", and note that the French version called for withdrawal from "des territoires occupés" – "''the'' territories occupied". The French UN delegation insisted on this interpretation at the time, but both English and French are the Secretariat's working languages.

Supporters of the "Israeli viewpoint" note that the second part of that same sentence in the preamble explicitly recognizes the need of existing states to live in security.
They focus on the operative phrase calling for "secure and recognized boundaries" and note that the resolution calls for a withdrawal "from territories" rather than "from the territories" or "from all territories," as the Arabs and others proposed; the latter two terms were rejected from the final draft of Resolution 242.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=bVddOoQbBa0C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=%22vasily+kuznetsov%22+242&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7APyLyJdAW&amp;sig=AobMoBIOXh_zMSf5f2zFdge9sCI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA153,M1 Sydney Dawson Bailey, The Making of Resolution 242&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Orakhelashvili cites a number cases in which international tribunals have ruled that international organizations, including the Security Council, are bound by general international law. He says that inclusion of explicit clauses about the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and requiring respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty of a state demonstrates that the Council does not intend to offend peremptory norms in these specific ways. The resolution also acknowledges that these principles must be part of an accepted settlement. That is confirmed by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which reiterates the prohibition on the use of force and provides that any settlement obtained by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations or conflicting with a peremptory norm of general international law is invalid. According to Hans-Paul Gasser, ‘doubtful’ wording of the Council’s resolutions must always be construed in such a way as to avoid conflict with fundamental international obligations.&lt;ref&gt;See Orakhelashvili supra&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Paul Gasser,‘Collective Economic Sanctions and International Humanitarian Law&amp;nbsp;– An Enforcement Measure under the United Nations Charter and the Right of Civilians to Immunity: An Unavoidable Clash of Policy Goals’, (1996) 56 ZaöRV 880–881&lt;/ref&gt;

The USSR, India, Mali, Nigeria and Arab States all proposed that the resolution be changed to read "all territories" instead of "territories." Their request was discussed by the UN Security Council and "territories" was adopted instead of "all territories", after President Johnson told Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] that the delegates should not try to negotiate the details of a Middle East settlement in the corridors and meeting halls of the United Nations, and Ambassador Goldberg stipulated that the exact wording of the resolution would not affect the position of any of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967, UN Security Council Resolution 242 October 3 – November 22, 1967, Documents [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d521 521] and [https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v19/d540 540]&lt;/ref&gt; Per [[Hugh Foot, Baron Caradon|Lord Caradon]], the chief author of the resolution:

{{quote|It was from occupied territories that the Resolution called for withdrawal. The test was which territories were occupied. That was a test not possibly subject to any doubt. As a matter of plain fact East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza, the Golan and Sinai were occupied in the 1967 conflict. It was on withdrawal from occupied territories that the Resolution insisted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;‘UN Security Council Resolution 242 – A Case Study in Diplomatic Ambiguity’, Caradon et al, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Hugh Foot, Baron Caradon|Lord Caradon]] also maintained,
{{quote|We didn't say there should be a withdrawal to the '67 line; we did not put the 'the' in, we did not say all the territories, deliberately.. We all knew&amp;nbsp;– that the boundaries of '67 were not drawn as permanent frontiers, they were a cease-fire line of a couple of decades earlier... We did not say that the '67 boundaries must be forever; it would be insanity.&lt;ref&gt;(MacNeil/Lehrer Report&amp;nbsp;– March 30, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During a symposium on the subject [[Hugh Foot, Baron Caradon|Lord Caradon]] said that Israel was in clear defiance of resolution 242. He specifically cited the "annexation of East Jerusalem" and "the creeping colonialism on the West Bank and in Gaza and in the Golan."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

However, British Foreign Secretary [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] said:

{{quote|I have been asked over and over again to clarify, modify or improve the wording, but I do not intend to do that. The phrasing of the Resolution was very carefully worked out, and it was a difficult and complicated exercise to get it accepted by the UN Security Council. I formulated the Security Council Resolution. Before we submitted it to the Council, we showed it to Arab leaders. The proposal said 'Israel will withdraw from territories that were occupied', and not from 'the' territories, which means that Israel will not withdraw from all the territories.&lt;ref&gt;The Jerusalem Post, 23 January 1970&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Statements by Security Council representatives===
The representative for [[India]] stated to the Security Council:

{{quote|It is our understanding that the draft resolution, if approved by the Council, will commit it to the application of the principle of total withdrawal of Israel forces from all the territories&amp;nbsp;– I repeat, all the territories&amp;nbsp;– occupied by Israel as a result of the conflict which began on 5 June 1967.&lt;ref name="SP1382"/&gt;}}

The representatives from [[Nigeria]], [[France]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Bulgaria]], [[United Arab Republic]] (Egypt), [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], [[Jordan]], [[Argentina]] and [[Mali]] supported this view, as worded by the representative from Mali: "[Mali] wishes its vote today to be interpreted in the light of the clear and unequivocal interpretation which the representative of India gave of the provisions of the United Kingdom text." The Russian representative [[Vasili Vasilyevich Kuznetsov|Vasili Kuznetsov]] stated:

{{quote|We understand the decision taken to mean the withdrawal of Israel forces from all, and we repeat, all territories belonging to Arab States and seized by Israel following its attack on those States on 5 June 1967. This is borne out by the preamble to the United Kingdom draft resolution [S/8247] which stresses the "inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war". It follows that the provision contained in that draft relating to the right of all States in the Near East "to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries" cannot serve as a pretext for the maintenance of Israel forces on any part of the Arab territories seized by them as a result of war.&lt;ref name="SP1382"/&gt;}}

[[Israel]] was the only country represented at the Security Council to express a contrary view. The [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Taiwan|China]] and [[Japan]] were silent on the matter, but the US and UK did point out that other countries' comments on the meaning of 242 were simply their own views. The [[Syria]]n representative was strongly critical of the text's "vague call on Israel to withdraw".

The statement by the Brazilian representative perhaps gives a flavour of the complexities at the heart of the discussions:

{{quote|I should like to restate...the general principle that no stable international order can be based on the threat or use of force, and that the occupation or acquisition of territories brought about by such means should not be recognized...Its acceptance does not imply that borderlines cannot be rectified as a result of an agreement freely concluded among the interested States. We keep constantly in mind that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East has necessarily to be based on secure permanent boundaries freely agreed upon and negotiated by the neighboring States.&lt;ref name="SP1382"/&gt;}}

However, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] delegate [[Vasili Vasilyevich Kuznetsov|Vasily Kuznetsov]] argued: " ... phrases such as 'secure and recognized boundaries'. ... make it possible for Israel itself arbitrarily to establish new boundaries and to withdraw its forces only to those lines it considers appropriate." [1373rd meeting, para. 152.]

[[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court Justice]] [[Arthur Goldberg]], who represented the US in discussions, later stated: "The notable omissions in regard to withdrawal are the word 'the' or 'all' and 'the June 5, 1967 lines' the resolution speaks of withdrawal from occupied territories, without defining the extent of withdrawal".&lt;ref&gt;"The Meaning of 242," June 10, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
On November 23, 1967, the [[Secretary General]] appointed [[Gunnar Jarring]] as Special Envoy to negotiate the implementation of the resolution with the parties, the so-called [[Jarring Mission]]. The governments of [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]] and [[Lebanon]] recognized Jarring's appointment and agreed to participate in his shuttle diplomacy, although they differed on key points of interpretation of the resolution. The government of [[Syria]] rejected Jarring's mission on grounds that total Israeli withdrawal was a prerequisite for further negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sixdaywar.org/content/242response.asp Resolution 242: Response from the affected parties] www.sixdaywar.org&lt;/ref&gt; The talks under Jarring's auspices lasted until 1973, but bore no results. After 1973, the Jarring mission was replaced by bilateral and multilateral peace conferences.

'''White Parties''' are [[circuit party|circuit parties]] at which the standard clothing is all or almost all [[white]]. In the United States, White Parties have taken place in [[Chicago]], [[New York City]], [[Miami]], [[Palm Springs, California]], and other cities. Other White Parties have taken place in [[Montreal]], [[Rome]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Doncaster]] and [[Hong Kong]]. The events are generally independent of each other.

==Chicago==
One of the first parties was held August 8, 1974, hosted by Chicago business owner [[Chuck Renslow]] to celebrate his birthday and thank his patrons. It was then held for the next 36 years until 2010. The largest party was held in 1979 at [[Navy Pier]] with 5,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baim|first=Tracy|title=Leatherman: The Legend of Chuck Renslow|year=2011 |publisher=CreateSpace|isbn=978-1461119081|page=414|author2=Keehnen, Owen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York==
The [[New York City]] White Party was first held at the private gay disco "Flamingo" on Broadway and Houston, on Presidents' Day weekend. The white theme derived from the snow often to be found that time of year. It was then adopted by the East Village disco "The Saint" during the month of February of each year usually coinciding with the full moon. Dress requirement was always white.  After the closing of "The Saint" in 1988, The White Party became the norm for other cities around the country in the current circuit party system to host such events.

==Miami==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2017}}
The [[Miami]] White Party is an annual [[fundraiser]] party for [[HIV/AIDS]] research. The all-white clothing theme was chosen by co-founders [[Frank Wager]] and Jorge Suarez. The first White Party began as AIDS began decimating the gay population. Wager and Suarez began planning an event they hoped would raise awareness and money to reduce HIV/AIDS in South Florida.

Wagner, Suarez and their friends dropped leaflets outside [[gay bar]]s in Miami and [[Fort Lauderdale]], got businesses to donate food and liquor and promoted the party. Sixteen hundred guests, asked to wear white, attended on Sunday night, December 1, 1985. Each paid $10.  Wager, a Salvadoran-born real-estate agent, hadn't yet been diagnosed with HIV when the first White Party was held, which benefited Health Crisis Network (now known as Care Resource).

Through the years, White Party attendees have included [[Nell Carter]] (who sang at the first White Party), [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Calvin Klein]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Crystal Waters]], [[Exposé (group)|Exposé]], [[Lorna Luft]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]], and in 2013 Estonian singer [[Kerli]] performed.

The one-night fundraiser became a week of events held annually on November 27 with events in Miami and [[Miami Beach]]. Most of the parties are geared to gay men, but there are several events for [[lesbian]]s and mixed crowds as well. In 1994 Keith Cromley the Assistant Director of Development at Health Crisis Network and Alain Berrebi, Founding Chair of White Party Week,
worked together to create White Party Week in Miami, first as a fundraiser for Health Crisis Network then for Care Resource.
Lark Bennett, Director of Development at Care Resource and Keith Cromley we’re both instrumental as staff members in making sure that this huge event ran like a well-oiled machine. White Party Week started off in 1995 with six events and grew to 23 events by the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kissell |first1=Ted |title=Fight For Your White To Party |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/fight-for-your-white-to-party-6357657 |publisher=Miami New Times |date=16 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, more events were added, including "White Dreams" and "Muscle Beach". In 1998, the Health Crisis Network merged with [[Community Research Initiative]], and the White Party Week brought in over $2 million. It is now the largest HIV/AIDS fundraiser in the world, with DJs, performers and artists attending from several countries. White Party [[Compact disc|CDs]] have been produced since 1996 with White Party remixes appearing on dance charts{{which|date=November 2016}}.

[[Care Resource]], the producers of White Party Week, is a [[501(c)(3)]] non profit medical agency operating with over 200 employees in Miami-Dade, Miami Beach and Broward County providing medical, counseling, testing, psychosocial, food bank services and more to their clients. White Party Week Miami attracts thousands of participants with a week of dance and events, mostly for an [[LGBT]] demographic.  The main White Party event is customarily held at [[Vizcaya Museum and Gardens]], the renaissance mansion in [[Coconut Grove]], with other events held at venues elsewhere in [[South Florida]].

In 2013 DJ [[Offer Nissim]] performed. Muscle Beach Party and women's events were also held. White Party Week Miami was the subject of documentaries on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]], [[The Travel Channel]], and the [[BBC]], with the documentary film "Fabulous" in 1999, [[Playboy Channel]], and in two episodes of ''[[Queer as Folk (2000 TV series)|Queer as Folk]]''. It is the setting for the [[2001 in film|2001]] [[documentary film]] ''[[When Boys Fly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hensley |first=Dennis |date=October 15, 2002 |title=Surviving the circuit |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w2QEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61 |magazine=The Advocate |location= |publisher= |access-date=November 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palm Springs White Party was described by ''[[Frommer's]] Travel Guide'' as "one of the biggest and best on the US party circuit ... [with] over 20,000 gay men dressed in white. The Palm Springs White Party Sunday Tea Dance features a Ferris Wheel and a fireworks display."&lt;ref&gt;[http://events.frommers.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&amp;event_id=27131 "White Party Spring Break"], ''Frommer's Online Travel Guide''.
