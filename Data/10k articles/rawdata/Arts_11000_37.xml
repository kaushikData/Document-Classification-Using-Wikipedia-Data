      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2675">'''''32 Postkarten''''' is a literature and art project that has been devised and coordinated by [[Torkel S. Wächter]]. It retells the story of a German-Jewish family from the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] to the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]]. The authentic postcards, with English and German translations, and commentaries, are being published on the Internet from March 2010 in ‘simulated real time’ - on the date they were written, but 70 years later - at www.32postkarten.com.&lt;ref name=Historical&gt;{{cite journal|title=32 Postkarten|work=[[The Historical Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It all started ten years ago, when Mr Wächter discovered a number of packing cases in an attic in Stockholm. They contained letters, diaries, old exercise books, newspaper cuttings and a cigar box with black-and-white photographs inside.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mynewsdesk.com/il/view/pressrelease/32-rediscovered-postcards-from-the-second-world-war-389542&lt;/ref&gt; And above all, in a plastic bag, the 32 postcards written by Mr Wächter's grandparents in Hamburg and posted to his father in Sweden just before the Holocaust. 

Given its postcard-length format, the  material is well suited for the teaching of secondary and tertiary level history and German in schools. The material will remain available online well after the publication of the last postcard in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swedishbookreview.com/news.php#i20102&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014 '''32 Postkarten - Post aus Nazi-Deutschland''',  {{ISBN|9783862822928}}, will be published by ACABUS-Verlag. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acabus-verlag.de/vorschau_45/2014_61/32-postkarten-post-aus-nazi-deutschland_9783862822928.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301162852/http://www.acabus-verlag.de/vorschau_45/2014_61/32-postkarten-post-aus-nazi-deutschland_9783862822928.htm |archivedate=1 March 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/32postkarten&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ballochmyle Cup and Ring marked stone - 2.JPG|thumb|250px|Cup-and-ring mark stone at Ballochmyle, [[Mauchline]]]]
The '''Ballochmyle cup and ring marks''' were first recorded at Ballochmyle (NS 5107 2552), [[Mauchline]], [[East Ayrshire]], Scotland in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Love|first=|year=2003|title=Ayrshire : Discovering a County.|publisher=|isbn=|page= 152}}&lt;/ref&gt; very unusually carved on a vertical red sandstone cliff face, forming one of the most extensive areas of such carvings as yet found in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=|year=2010|title=Cup-and-Ring Markings at Ballochmyle, Ayrshire|publisher=|isbn=|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been designated a [[scheduled ancient monument]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/SM4484|title=Ballochmyle Viaduct,rock carvings 280m NE of - SM4484|publisher= Historic Environment Scotland|accessdate= 10 September 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
These carvings or [[petroglyph]]s were first recorded in 1986 (although a '1751' carved date suggests an earlier discovery) when the [[Kingencleugh Castle|Kingencleugh Estate]] decided to clear an area of vegetation along the north side of the Liddell Burn that is a minor tributary stream of the [[River Ayr]] in an area famous for its quarrying of red sandstone. The removal of vegetation exposed the carvings that are distributed across two faces of a vertical outcrop of rock and they were reported to the Dick Institute in [[Kilmarnock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailed Survey of Ballochmyle Cup and Ring Marks, Ayrshire|url=http://www.aocarchaeology.com/news/article/ballochmyle-survey/|publisher=AOC Archaeology Group|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of possible medieval carvings, the extensive quarrying with numerous workmen employed in the area, especially during the construction of the Ballochmyle Viaduct, emphasises how surprising it is that these [[glyph]]s were overlooked for so long, especially as they are only about 2&amp;nbsp;km south-east of [[Mauchline]]'s town centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=|year=2010|title=Cup-and-Ring Markings at Ballochmyle, Ayrshire|publisher=|isbn=|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The rock here is described as being a "''pink dessert sandstone from the [[Permian]] age showing clear signs of dune bedding''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=|year=2010|title=Cup-and-Ring Markings at Ballochmyle, Ayrshire|publisher=|isbn=|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cup and ring marks are composed of two 'panels' with several hundred '[[Cup and ring mark|cup and ring]]' and other [[glyph]]s or carvings in a range of styles, ranging from single shallow cups through to deeper cups with multiple rings. Less common, but unique in the Scottish context are ‘square with cup’ carvings; ‘ringed stars’ are also present. Three deer-like carvings and some other inscriptions with Lombardic style letters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=|year=2010|title=Cup-and-Ring Markings at Ballochmyle, Ayrshire|publisher=|isbn=|page= 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also carved into the rockface and these are thought to be medieval in date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailed Survey of Ballochmyle Cup and Ring Marks, Ayrshire|url=http://www.aocarchaeology.com/news/article/ballochmyle-survey/|publisher=AOC Archaeology Group|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several feet of soil were removed from the bottom of the corner that divides the two main halves of the site and this uncovered three '[[Trilithon|trilithon-like]]' carvings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cup and Ring Marked Rock (Prehistoric)|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/43557/ballochmyle|publisher=RCAHMS|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Campbell|first=|year=2003|title=Ayrshire. A Historical Guide.|publisher=|isbn=|page= 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others may await discovery where the soil has not been removed. The carvings were protected by the vegetation and began to deteriorate after this was removed and in addition vandalism and theft of a panel has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=|year=2010|title=Cup-and-Ring Markings at Ballochmyle, Ayrshire|publisher=|isbn=|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that they were historically hidden from direct view by trees and shrubs.

The Ballochmyle [[glyph]]s or motifs are carved on red sandstone, however they are found elsewhere on other sedimentary rocks such as [[Millstone Grit]]s, as well as the harder [[igneous]] and [[Metamorphic|metamorphic rocks]] such as [[granite]]s and [[schist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The basic 'cup' is the most common carving however a wide range of glyphs exist with single to multiple concentric circles that are sometimes cut through in various ways by channels, etc. Where concentric rings exist the central cup often appears to dominate in depth and size&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that they were subject to repeated reworking over a period of time. Some incomplete or poorly formed glyphs exist here suggesting that different persons were involved in making them and frequent overlays of existing glyphs with either 'cups' or 'cup rings' suggests that they were created over an extended period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies suggest that distinct stylistic groupings may be present with one panel area having simple cups and cups with grooves, whilst another area has predominately bold cups with multiple concentric rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 35 &amp; 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; An area with an apparent Lombardic style lettering may read 'ASAID' with two or three unreadable leading letters and a likely lost section. The final element is a date '1751' that is considered authentic but did not lead to further recorded investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence suggests that cup and ring art was created from the [[Neolithic]] through to the [[Bronze Age]], that is approximately 4000 BC to 1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cup and ring mark]] stones are frequently found throughout Britain, with over 2500 sites in England alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; however an unusual feature of those at Ballochmyle is that they have been carved on nearly or actual vertical surfaces rather than horizontal and often 'altar-like' exposed stone outcrops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cup and Ring Marked Rock (Prehistoric)|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/43557/ballochmyle|publisher=RCAHMS|access-date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of carvings were created using 'hammerstones' or 'peckers', examples of these have been found elsewhere, hitting the surface of the rock repeatedly or using a grinding motion until the desired design was formed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the long grooves appear to be a series of cups that were then joined together. The soft nature of the stone at Ballochmyle gives insights into how the [[glyphs]] were created with many small holes that could not have been formed by a hammering action.

The contrast with the original rock surface and the effect of shadow and rain usually makes the markings stand out however hints of the use of coloured pigments have been found at other sites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such things as animal fat, charcoal, plants dyes, etc. could have been used during various types of ceremonies to enhance the glyphs or as part of their cultural use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency and widespread use of the same glyphs or motifs indicates that they had definite interpretive meanings and significance to the cultures that created them and these developed and then persisted over thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The locations indicate that these carvings were mostly for public display and not usually intended as part of secret practices where the fact that they were hidden was important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be relevant that the Ballochmyle area has both spectacular geological formations and geographical features in addition to the presence of a significant [[Liminal deity|liminal]] zone in the form of a major watercourse, the [[River Ayr]]. Carvings into rocks can have deeper meanings such as with the carved footprint [[Petrosomatoglyph]]s at [[Dunadd]] in [[Argyll]], linking a person literally to the land. The concept of the [[Anima locus]] is pertinent here, that is the 'soul' of a place, its essential personality as perceived in the imagination and emotions of visitors. A concept linked to the belief in supernatural spirits of nature as residing in stones, springs, mountains, islands, trees, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pennick|first=|year=1996|title=Celtic Sacred Landscapes|publisher=|isbn=|pages= 13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form of religious significance linked to life and death, past and present, real and spiritual worlds, etc. has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant factor is that, as previously stated, they were created from [[Neolithic]] through to the [[Bronze Age]], that is approximately 4000 BC to 1500 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they ceased when the [[Celts|Celtic Culture]] began to dominate and suppress older cultural practices. During this time smaller nomadic groups that might visit certain sites seasonally developed into sedentary communities with hierarchical leadership structures and specific communal religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cupandring.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A facsimile of an unusual cup and ring mark stone from [[Dalgarven]], [[North Ayrshire]] ]] 
[[File:Sardinia mamoiada perda pinta.jpg|250px|thumb|A cup and ring mark stone from [[Sardinia]] ]]
Many 'galleries' of [[cup and ring mark]] art are in prominent places within the landscape, such as river gorges, waterfalls, outcrops, caves, etc. and it has been suggested that they may have defined territorial boundaries, either for a locality or for a significant land holding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few prehistoric track ways have been positively identified however some link with the more practical aspects of [[Ley line]]s may be indicated by the observation that cup and ring art is sometimes found overlooking natural harbours, on prominent natural landscape features, in mountain passes, along valley sides, at the entrances to inland routes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that natural features of the rock faces may influence the cup and ring mark sizes, distribution and type in addition to 'framing' the carvings. Fissures, grooves, wind erosion marks, cracks, dune bedding, etc. may all have been regarded by the [[Cup and ring mark]] carvers as significant and meaningful in their own right to be copied, enhanced, removed or incorporated as possibly the work of their 'ancestors' or even the works of the gods themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cup and ring mark panels may have only been used seasonally and the varying level of complexity at sites has been interpreted as being both more and less significant in terms of the level of meaning present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universality of [[cup and ring mark]]ings suggest a commonality of the origins of such [[glyph]]s that may relate to natural phenomena that are deemed significant, such as the concentricles that form on water when an object or offering is placed in it and although this may have been interpreted differently by the many cultures involved, the [[liminality]] with associated themes of thresholds and communication with the 'other side' may be one explanation for the use of cup and rings rather than the extensive use of glyphs such as ovals, boxes, triangles, star-shapes, etc.

==Surveys of the markings==
In 2015 AOC Archaeology group were employed by the Forestry Commission Scotland to carry out a survey of laser scanning and [[photogrammetry]] on the Ballochmyle cup and ring marks. Laser scanning recorded the glyphs in 3D in minute detail, taking millions of measurements. The Photogrammetry involved photographing the site from many different angles and then bringing the data together to create a 3D model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailed Survey of Ballochmyle Cup and Ring Marks, Ayrshire|url=http://www.aocarchaeology.com/news/article/ballochmyle-survey/|publisher=AOC Archaeology Group|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RCAHMS carried out a survey on behalf of Historic Scotland in 1987 and a series of drawings were lodged with what is now [[Historic Environment Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cup and Ring Marked Rock (Prehistoric)|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/43557/ballochmyle|publisher=RCAHMS|access-date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Buskin (PSF).jpg|thumb|Buskins]]
A '''buskin''' is a knee- or calf-length [[boot]] made of [[leather]] or [[cloth]] which laces closed, but is open across the toes. It was worn by [[Tragedy|Athenian tragic]] actors, hunters, and soldiers in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]], [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] societies.
 
The word buskin, only recorded in [[English language|English]] since 1503 meaning "half boot", is of unknown origin, perhaps from [[Old French]] ''brousequin'' (in modern [[French language|French]] ''brodequin'') or directly from its [[Middle Dutch]] model ''brosekin'' "small leather boot". Figurative senses relating to tragedy are from the word being used (since 1570) to translate [[Greek language|Greek]] '''''kothornos''''' ({{lang-el|κόθορνος}}) or Latin '''''cothurnus''''', the high, thick-soled boot worn in Athenian tragedy; contrasted with [[sock]] (from Latin '''''soccus'''''), the low shoe worn by [[Comedy (drama)|comedians]].

[[Byzantine emperor]]s were formally clad in purple buskins, embroidered in gold with [[double-headed eagle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;John Julius Norwich, ''A Short History of Byzantium'', Penguin 1998, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roman Catholic Church ==
{{main|Episcopal sandals}}
In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], buskins are ceremonial liturgical [[stocking]]s (''caligae'' in [[Latin]]) of [[silk]], sometimes interwoven with gold threads and even heavily embroidered, formerly worn by the [[Officiant|celebrant]] of a [[pontifical Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03087b.htm |title=Buskin |work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buskins can be worn over the [[episcopal sandals]], regular dress socks with regular dress shoes, or over the red [[papal shoes]] worn by the [[Pope]].

Originally liturgical buskins were worn by all priests, until about the eighth century when they were reserved for the exclusive use of [[bishop]]s as part of the [[pontificalia]], i.e. episcopal "[[regalia]]", a privilege in modern times extended to some lesser [[prelate]]s. In [[liturgical colours|liturgical colour]] they correspond to the [[chasuble]], but are never worn with black.

'''Christian Dior SE''' ({{IPA-fr|kʁis.tjɑ̃ djɔːʁ}}), commonly known as '''Dior''', is a European [[luxury goods]] company controlled and chaired by French businessman [[Bernard Arnault]], who also heads [[LVMH]] – the world's largest luxury group.

Founded in 1948 by the eponymous designer [[Christian Dior]], today the company designs and retails [[ready-to-wear]], leather goods, fashion accessories, footwear, jewelry, timepieces, fragrance, makeup, and skincare products while also maintaining its tradition as a creator of recognized [[Haute couture|haute-couture]] (under the ''Christian Dior Couture'' division). While the Christian Dior label remains largely for women's offerings, the company also operates the ''[[Dior Homme]]'' division for men and the ''baby Dior'' label for children's wear. Products are sold throughout its portfolio of retail stores worldwide, as well as through its online store.

==History==

===Founding===
The House of Dior was established on 16 December 1946 in "a private house"&lt;ref name="dior"&gt;[http://www.dior-finance.com/en/historique.asp Company History at Dior's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107025618/http://www.dior-finance.com/en/historique.asp |date=7 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at 30 [[Avenue Montaigne]] Paris B. However, the current Dior corporation celebrates "1947" as the opening year.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; Dior was financially backed by wealthy businessman [[Marcel Boussac]].&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt;&lt;ref name="funding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Christian-Dior-SA-Company-History.html|title=History of Christian Dior S.A.|work=fundinguniverse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boussac had originally invited Dior to design for [[Philippe et Gaston]], but Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start under his own name rather than reviving an old brand.&lt;ref name=pochna&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pochna |first1=Marie-France |last2=Savill|first2=Joanna (translator) |title=Christian Dior : the man who made the world look new |date=1996 |publisher=Arcade Pub.

Nevertheless, Dior was allowed a then-unusual great part in his namesake label (legal leadership, a non-controlling stake in the firm, and one-third of pretax profits) despite Boussac's reputation as a "control freak". Dior's creativity also negotiated him a good salary.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

==="New Look"===
[[File:Christian Dior (Moscow exhibition, 2011) 26.jpg|upright=.69|thumb|"Bar" suit, 1947, displayed in Moscow, 2011]]
On 12 February 1947, Dior launched his first fashion collection for Spring–Summer 1947. The show of "90 models of his first collection on six [[mannequin]]s" was presented in the salons of the company's headquarters at 30 Avenue Montaigne.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; Originally, the two lines were named "Corolle" and "Huit".&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; However, the new collection went down in fashion history as the "''New Look''" after the editor-in-chief of ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' [[Carmel Snow]] exclaimed, "It's such a new look!"&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt;&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; The New Look was a revolutionary era for women back in the forties.&lt;ref name="dior.com"&gt;Dior. (1947). The New Look, a legend. Retrieved, from http://www.dior.com/couture/en_hk/the-house-of-dior/the-story-of-dior/the-new-look-revolution&lt;/ref&gt; When the collection was presented, the editor in chief also showed appreciation by saying; "It’s quite a revolution, dear Christian!" &lt;ref name="dior.com"/&gt; The debut collection of Christian Dior is credited with having revived the fashion industry of France.&lt;ref name=mistry&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mistry |first1=Meenal |title=Spring's new look: Sixty-five years ago, Christian Dior started a revolution that's still influencing the designers of today|journal=Harper's Bazaar|date=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with that, the New Look brought back the spirit of haute couture in France as it was considered glamorous and young-looking.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, A., &amp; Palmer, A.

London: Bloomsbury Academic, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc.&lt;/ref&gt;
The silhouette was characterised by a small, nipped-in waist and a full skirt falling below mid-calf length, which emphasised the bust and hips, as epitomized by the 'Bar' suit from the first collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Golden Age of Couture – Exhibition Highlights: 'Bar' Suit &amp; Hat – Christian Dior|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/1486_couture/exhibHighBarSuit.php|publisher=Victoria &amp; Albert Museum|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Christian Dior: "Bar" suit" (C.I.58.34.30_C.I.69.40) In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History .

(October 2006) (Accessed 13 February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The collection overall showcased more stereotypically feminine designs in contrast to the popular fashions of wartime, with full skirts, tight waists, and soft shoulders. Dior retained some of the masculine aspects as they continued to hold popularity through the early 1940s, but he also wanted to include more feminine style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vintagedancer.com/1940s/1940s-fashion-history/|title=1940s Fashion History for Women and Men|last=Sessions|first=D.|date=June 26, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Look became extremely popular, its full-skirted silhouette influencing other fashion designers well into the 1950s, and Dior gained a number of prominent clients from Hollywood, the United States, and the European aristocracy. As a result, Paris, which had fallen from its position as the capital of the fashion world after WWII, regained its preeminence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/events/how-haute-couture-rescued-war-torn-paris/ |title=How Haute Couture rescued war torn Paris |first=Anne |last=Sebba |date=29 June 2016 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hcn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hautecouturenews.com/2015/story/christian-dior/ | title=Revolutions in Fashion: Christian Dior |first=Lucy |last=Zotoff |publisher=Haute Couture News |date=25 December 2015 |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Look was welcomed in western Europe as a refreshing antidote to the austerity of wartime and de-feminizing uniforms, and was embraced by stylish women such as [[Princess Margaret]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orderofsplendor.blogspot.com/2012/02/flashback-friday-fabulous-princess.html|title=The Royal Order of Sartorial Splendor: Flashback Friday: The Fabulous Princess Margaret|work=orderofsplendor.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Harold Koda]], Dior credited [[Charles James (designer)|Charles James]] with inspiring The New Look.&lt;ref name="The Costume Institute Previews 'Charles James: Beyond Fashion'"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/the-costume-institute-previews-charles-james-beyond-fashion-7437029?src=n/newsAlert/20140211-3 |title=The Costume Institute Previews 'Charles James: Beyond Fashion' | publisher=WWD | date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=12 February 2014 |author=Feitelberg, Rosemary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dior's designs from the "New Look" did not only affect the designers in the 1950s, but still some of the newer designers we know from now in the 2000s, including Thom Browne, Miuccia Prada, and Vivienne Westwood. Dior's evening dresses from that time are still referred to by many designers, and they have been seen in different wedding themed catwalks with multiple layers of fabric building up below the small waist (Jojo, 2011). Examples include Vivienne Westwood’s Ready-to-Wear Fall/Winter 2011 and Alexander McQueen's Ready to Wear Fall/Winter 2011 (Jojo, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ladyjojosboutique.wordpress.com/2011/07/13/christian-diors-new-look-of-the-1940s-and-1950s/|title=Christian Dior’s ‘New Look’ of the 1940s and 1950s|date=2011-07-13|work=Lady JoJo's|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not everyone was pleased with the New Look, however. Some considered the amount of material to be wasteful, especially after years of cloth rationing. Feminists in particular were outraged, feeling that these [[corset]]ed designs were restrictive and regressive, and that they took away a woman's independence.&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dw.com/en/the-new-look-how-christian-dior-revolutionized-fashion-70-year-ago/a-37491236 | title=The New Look: How Christian Dior revolutionized fashion 70 year [sic] ago | first=Jan | last=Tomes | publisher=Deutsche Welle | date=10 February 2017 | accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow designer [[Coco Chanel]] remarked, "Only a man who never was intimate with a woman could design something that uncomfortable."&lt;ref name="hcn" /&gt; Despite such protests, the New Look was highly influential, continuing to inform the work of other designers and fashion well into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="mistry" /&gt; For the 60th anniversary of the New Look in 2007, John Galliano revisited it for his Spring-Summer collection for Dior.&lt;ref name="alexander"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alexander |first1=Hilary |title=Galliano's new look at the New Look |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1540325/Gallianos-new-look-at-the-New-Look.html |accessdate=20 April 2017 |work=Telegraph.co.uk |date=23 January 2007|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galliano used the wasp waist and rounded shoulders, modernised and updated with references to [[origami]] and other Japanese influences.&lt;ref name="alexander" /&gt; In 2012 [[Raf Simons]] revisited the New Look for his debut haute couture collection for Dior, wishing to update its ideas for the 21st century in a minimalist but also sensual and sexy manner.&lt;ref name="mistry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="menkes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Menkes|first1=Suzy|title=At Dior, a Triumph of 21st Century Modernism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/29/fashion/29iht-fdior29.html|accessdate=20 April 2017|work=The New York Times|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simons's work for Dior retained the luxurious fabrics and silhouette, but encouraged self-respect for the woman's body and liberation of expression.&lt;ref name="menkes" /&gt; The design process for this collection, which was produced in only eight weeks, is documented in ''[[Dior and I]]'', presenting Simons's use of technology and modernist re-interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lemire|first1=Christy|title=Dior and I Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2015)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dior-and-i-2015|website=Roger Ebert|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=20 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "New Look" of Christian Dior was an international success in the late 1940s. His designs were an up to date elegant look, which no one had seen before. He wanted to make women as graceful and ladylike as possible showing women's figures. He brought femininity to an extreme, which completely overthrew the fashion from the 1920s and 1930s. After the launch of his collection, Christian Dior became one of the most famous people in the world of fashion. The most important part was that they could be worn successfully by women with all body shapes.

''Dior'' has never lost the elegant look, even after Christian Dior died, the brand kept on the idea of the elegance and high end looks. It always brought out women's beauty and showed it to the whole world with wearing the designs. One of the most important part of his designs is that it is fully showing women's body curves to make it as feminine as possible, and no matter what kind of body shape it is, it can always fit into his designed curves perfectly.

===Dior Parfums===
Available references contradict themselves whether ''[[Christian Dior Parfums]]'' was established in 1947 or 1948. The Dior corporation itself lists the founding of Christian Dior Parfums as 1947, with the launch of its first perfume, ''Miss Dior''.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; Dior revolutionized the perfumery industry with the launch of the highly popular ''Miss Dior parfum'', which was named after Catherine Dior (Christian Dior's sister).&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; Christian Dior Ltd owned 25%, manager of Coty perfumes held 35%, and Boussac owned 40% of the perfume business, headed by Serge Heftler Louiche.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; [[Pierre Cardin]] was made head of the Dior workshop from 1947 until 1950. In 1948, a New York City Christian Dior Parfums branch was established—this could be the cause of establishment-date issue.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; The modern Dior corporation also notes that "a luxury ready-to-wear house is established in New York at the corner of [[Fifth Avenue|5th Avenue]] and 57th Street, the first of its kind," in 1948.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; In 1949, the "Diorama" perfume is released and&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; by 1949, the New Look line alone made a profit FFr 12.7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

===Expansion and death of Dior===
[[File:Buenos Aires - Eva Perón de gala en fundación del Teatro Colón.jpeg|right|thumb|upright=.91|[[Eva Perón]], the [[First Lady of Argentina]], wearing a Dior Dress in the [[Teatro Colón]], 1950 ]]
Expansion from France began by the end of 1949 with the opening of a Christian Dior boutique in New York City. By the end of the year, Dior fashions made up 75% of Paris's fashion exports and 5% of France's total export revenue.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

In 1949, Douglas Cox from Melbourne, Australia, travelled to Paris to meet with Christian Dior to discuss the possibility of having Dior pieces made for the Australian market. Christian Dior and Douglas Cox signed a contract for Dior to produce original designs and for Douglas Cox to create them in his Flinders Lane workshop.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19490304&amp;id=ErITAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ub0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6152,4920691&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; A young Jill Walker, still in her mid teens, was one of the many workers for Douglas Cox, a couture label now in the headlines in Australian newspapers almost daily. Jill would go onto forming a couture legacy in Melbourne with popular labels such as Jinoel and Marti with husband Noel Kemelfield.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/fashion-news/photographer-in-race-to-document-living-history-of-melbourne-fashions-of-the-1950s-20160601-gp92qu.html&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement between Dior and Douglas Cox really put Australian dressmaking on the global stage, yet ultimately the 60 Dior models proved to be too avant-garde for the conservative Australian taste. Douglas Cox was unable to continue the contract beyond the single 1949 season making these Dior-Cox couture pieces some of the most rare collectors items in Australian couture.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19490501&amp;id=OB0QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IZMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7309,197990&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Jacques Rouët, the general manager of Dior Ltd, devised a licensing program to place the now-renowned name of "Christian Dior" visibly on a variety of [[luxury goods]].&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; It was placed first on neckties&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; and soon was applied to hosiery, furs, hats, gloves, handbags, jewelry, lingerie, and scarves.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Members of the [[French Chamber of Couture]] denounced it as a degrading action for the [[Haute couture|haute-couture]] image. Nevertheless, licensing became a profitable move and began a trend to continue "for decades to come",&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; which all couture houses followed.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt;

Also in 1950, Christian Dior was the exclusive designer of [[Marlene Dietrich]]'s dresses in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]''. In 1951, Dior released his first book, ''Je Suis Couturier'' (''I am a Couturier'') through publishers Editions du Conquistador. Despite the company's strong European following, more than half of its revenue was generated in the United States by this time.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Christian Dior Models Limited was created in London in 1952.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; An agreement was made between the Sydney label [[House of Youth]] for Christian Dior New York models.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; [[Los Gobelinos]] in [[Santiago, Chile]], made an agreement with Dior for Christian Dior Paris Haute Couture.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; The first Dior shoe line was launched in 1953 with the aid of Roger Vivier. The company operated firmly established locations in Mexico, Cuba, Canada, and Italy by the end of 1953.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; As popularity of Dior goods grew, so did [[counterfeit]]ing.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; This illegal business was supported by women who could not afford the luxury goods.

By the mid-1950s, the House of Dior operated a well-respected fashion empire.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; The first Dior boutique was established in 1954 at 9 [[Counduit Street]]. In honour of [[Princess Margaret]] and the [[Frances Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Duchess of Marlborough]], a Dior fashion show was held at the Blemhein Palace in 1954 as well. Christian Dior launched more highly successful fashion lines between the years of 1954 and 1957.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; However, none came as close to the profound effect of the New Look.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Dior opened the Grande Boutique on the corner between [[Avenue Montaigne]] and [[Rue François Ier]] in 1955.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; The first Dior lipstick was also released in 1955.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; 100,000 garments had been sold by the time of the company's 10th anniversary in 1956.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Actress [[Ava Gardner]] had 14 dresses created for her in 1956 by Christian Dior for the [[Mark Robson]] film ''[[The Little Hut]]''.

Christian Dior appeared on the cover of ''TIME'' dated 4 March 1957. The designer soon afterwards died from a third heart attack in 1957.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt;&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; The captivating impact of Dior's creative fashion genius earned him recognition as one of history's greatest fashion figures.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Kevin Almond for ''Contemporary Fashion'' wrote that "by the time Dior died his name had become synonymous with taste and luxury."&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

===Dior without Christian Dior: 1957 through the 1970s===
The death of the head designer left the House of Dior in chaos, and general manager Jacques Rouët considered shutting down operation worldwide. This possibility was not received graciously by Dior licensees and the French fashion industry; the Maison Dior was too important to the financial stability of the industry to allow such an action. To bring the label back on its feet, Rouët promoted the 21-year-old [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] to Artistic Director the same year.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Laurent had joined the House's family in 1955 after being picked out by the original designer himself for the position of the first ever and only Head Assistant.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt;&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Laurent initially proved to have been the most appropriate choice after the debut of his first collection for Dior (the mention of ''Dior'' from this moment on refers to the company) in 1958.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; The clothes were as meticulously made and perfectly proportioned as Dior's in the same exquisite fabrics, but their young designer made them softer, lighter and easier to wear. Saint Laurent was hailed as a national hero. Emboldened by his success, his designs became more daring, culminating in the 1960 [[Beat poetry|Beat]] Look inspired by the [[existentialists]] in the [[Saint-Germain des Près]] cafés and jazz clubs. His 1960 [[bohemian]] look was harshly criticized, and even more in ''Women's Wear Daily''.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Marcel Boussac was furious, and in the spring, when Saint Laurent was called up to join the French army—which forced him to leave the House of Dior—the Dior management raised no objection. Saint-Laurent left after the completion of six Dior collections.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt;
[[File:Christian Dior Haute Coutre Suit by Marc Bohan, Spring-Summer 1973.jpg|left|thumb|upright=.79|Christian Dior Haute Couture suit designed by Marc Bohan, spring/summer 1973.&lt;br /&gt;Adnan Ege Kutay Collection]]
Laurent was replaced at Dior by designer [[Marc Bohan]] in late 1960. Bohan instilled his conservative style on the collections. He was credited by Rebecca Arnold as the man who kept the Dior label "at the forefront of fashion while still producing wearable, elegant clothes," and Women's Wear Daily, not surprisingly, claimed that he "rescued the firm."&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Bohan's designs were very well esteemed by prominent social figures. Actress [[Elizabeth Taylor]] ordered twelve Dior dresses from Bohan's Spring-Summer 1961 collection featuring the "Slim Look". The Dior perfume "Diorling" was released in 1963 and the men's fragrance "[[Eau Sauvage]]" was released in 1966.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; Bohan's assistant Philippe Guibourgé launches the first French [[ready-to-wear]] collection "Miss Dior" in 1967. This is not to be confused with the already existing New York Ready-to-Wear store established in 1948. Designed by Bohan, "Baby Dior" opens its first boutique in 1967 at 28 Avenue Montaigne. The Christian Dior Coordinated Knit line is released in 1968 and management of the Fashion Furs Department of Christian Dior is taken by Frédéric Castet.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; This year as well, Dior Parfums was sold to [[LVMH|Moët-Hennessy]] (which would itself become [[LVMH]]) due to Boussac's ailing textile company (the still-owner of Dior).&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt;&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; This, however, had no effect on the House of Dior operations, and so the ''Christian Dior Cosmetics'' business was born in 1969 with the creation of an exclusive line.

Following this, Bohan launched the first ''Christian [[Dior Homme]]'' clothing line in 1970. A new Dior boutique at Parly II was decorated by Gae Aulenti and the "Diorella" perfume was released in 1972. Christian Dior Ready-to-Wear Fur Collection was created in France in 1973, and then manufactured under license in the United States, Canada, and Japan.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; The first Dior watch "Black Moon" was released in 1975 in collaboration with licensee Benedom. Dior haute-couture graced the bodies of [[Princess Grace of Monaco]], Nicaraguan First Lady [[Hope Portocarrero]], [[Princess Alexandria of Yugoslavia]], and [[Lady Pamela Hicks]] ([[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]]'s younger daughter) for the wedding of [[HRH The Prince of Wales]] and [[Lady Diana Spencer]]. In 1978, the Boussac Group filed for bankruptcy and so its assets (including those of Christian Dior) were purchased by the Willot Group under the permission of the [[Paris Trade Court]].&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; The perfume "Dioressence" was released in 1979.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt;

[[File:DiorBohan1.JPG|right|thumb|upright=.69|A simple Dior Haute Couture evening gown designed by [[Marc Bohan]], from the Spring 1983 collection]]
In 1980, Dior released the men's fragrance "Jules".&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; After the Willot Group went into bankruptcy in 1981, [[Bernard Arnault]] and his investment group purchased it for "one symbolic franc" in December 1984.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt;&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; The Dior perfume "Poison" was launched in 1985. That same year, Arnault became chairman, chief executive officer, and managing director of the company.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; On assuming leadership, Arnault did away with the company's mediocre textile operations, to focus on the Bon Marché department store and Christian Dior Couture. Operations for Christian Dior drastically changed for the better under Arnault. He repositioned it as the [[holding company]] Christian Dior S.A. of the Dior Couture fashion business.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; On the 40th anniversary of Dior's first collection, the [[Paris Fashion Museum]] dedicated an exhibition to Christian Dior.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; In 1988, Arnault's Christian Dior S.A.'s took a 32% equity stake into the share capital of [[LVMH|Moët-Hennessy • Louis Vuitton]] through its subsidiary [[Jacques Rober]], creating what would become one of the leading and most influential [[luxury good]]s companies in the world. Under this milestone merger, the operations of Christian Dior Couture and Christian Dior Parfums were once again united. Italian-born [[Gianfranco Ferré]] replaced Bohan as head designer in 1989.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; The first such non-[[Frenchmen|Frenchman]], Ferré left behind traditional Dior associations of flirtation and romance, and introduced concepts and a style described as "refined, sober and strict."&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Ferré headed design for Haute Couture, Haute Fourrure, Women's Ready-to-Wear, Ready-to-Wear Furs and Women's Accessories collections. His first collection was awarded the [[Dé d'Or]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; That year, a boutique was opened in Hawaii and the LVMH stake by Jacques Rober rose to 44%.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt;

Further Dior boutiques were opened in 1990 in upscale New York City, Los Angeles, and Tokyo shopping districts. The stake in LVMH rose again, to 46%.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; Another collection of watches named "Bagheera"&amp;nbsp;– inspired by the round design of the "Black Moon" watches&amp;nbsp;– was also released in 1990. Having fired the company's managing executive Beatrice Bongbault in December 1990, Arnault took up that position until September 1991, when he placed former Bon Marché president Phillipe Vindry at the post.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; In 1991, Christian Dior was listed on the spot market and then on the [[Paris Stock Exchange]]'s monthly settlement market, and the perfume "Dune" was launched.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; Vindry dropped ready-to-wear prices by 10%. Still, a wool suit from Dior would come with a price label of USD 1,500.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; 1990 revenue for Dior was USD 129.3&amp;nbsp;million, with a net income of $22&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Dior was now reorganized into three categories: 1) women's ready-to-wear, lingerie, and children's wear 2) accessories and jewelry 3) menswear. Licensees and franchised boutiques were starting to be reduced, to increase the company's control over brand product. Licensing was in fact reduced by nearly half because Arnault and Vindry opted "for quality and exclusivity over quantity and accessibility."&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Wholly company-owned boutiques now opened in Hong Kong, Singapore, [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Cannes]], and [[Waikiki]], adding to its core stores located in New York City, Hawaii, Paris and [[Geneva]]. This held a potential to increase direct sales and profit margins while maintaining high-profile locations."&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; In 1992, Dior Homme was placed under the artistic direction of Patrick Lavoix, and the "Miss Dior" perfume was relaunched.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; Francois Baufume succeeded Vindry in 1993 and continued to reduce licenses of the Dior name.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

The production of Dior Haute Couture was spun off into a subsidiary named ''Christian Dior Couture'' in 1995.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; Also, the "La Parisienne" watch model was released – embodied in the watch "Parisian Chic". By that year, revenue for the label rose to USD 177 million, with a net income of USD 26.9&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Under the influence of Anna Wintour, editor and chief of Vogue, CEO Arnault appointed British designer [[John Galliano]] to replace [[Gianfranco Ferré]] in 1997 (Galliano on [[CBS News]]: "without Anna Wintour I would certainly not be at the house of Dior").&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/05/14/60minutes/main5013905.shtml | publisher=[[CBS News]] | title=Anna Wintour, Behind The Shades | date=14 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This choice of a British designer, once again instead of a French one, is said to have "ruffled some French feathers". Arnault himself stated that he "would have preferred a Frenchman", but that "talent has no nationality".&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; He even compared Galliano to Christian Dior himself, noting that "Galliano has a creative talent very close to that of Christian Dior. He has the same extraordinary mixture of romanticism, feminism, and modernity that symbolised Monsieur Dior. In all of his creations – his suits, his dresses – one finds similarities to the Dior style."&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Galliano sparked further interest in Dior with somewhat controversial fashion shows, such as "Homeless Show" (models dressed in newspapers and paper bags) or "S&amp;M Show".&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; Meanwhile, Dior licenses were being reduced further by new president and CEO Sidney Toledano.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; On 15 October 1997, the Dior headquarters store on Avenue Montaigne was reopened&amp;nbsp;–it had been closed and remodeled by [[Peter Marino]]&amp;nbsp;– in a celebrity-studded event including [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Demi Moore]] and [[Jacques Chirac]]. That year, Christian Dior Couture also took over all thirteen boutique franchises from Japan's Kanebo.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt;

In May 1998, another Dior boutique was opened in Paris. This time the store opened its doors on the Left Bank, Place Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Also this year, Victoire de Castellane became lead designer of ''Dior Fine Jewellery'' and the first Dior Fine Jewellery boutique opened in New York City. Paris itself would witness the opening of the first Parisian Dior Fine Jewellery boutique the following year, at 28 Avenue Montaigne.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; The perfume "[[J'Adore (fragrance)|J'adore]]" was released in 1999,&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; and on 5 October 1999, Galliano released the Dior Spring-Summer 2000 ready-to-wear fashion show, debuting the new Saddle bag. In the same year, Dior's long watch partner Benedom joined the [[LVMH]] group. In 2000, Galliano's leadership was extended to Ready to wear, accessories, advertising and communications. The first campaign under his leadership was photographed by Nick Knight and featured two women simulating intercourse.

While other brands in the late 1990s, notably Gucci,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/2003-02/030227-toms-pubic-ad-avoids-ban.aspx Tom Ford's latest Gucci shocker is approved by the Advertising Standards Authority (Vogue.com UK)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611121641/http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/2003-02/030227-toms-pubic-ad-avoids-ban.aspx |date=11 June 2011 }}.

As a matter of fact, it is considered that Galliano had revolutionized Dior more through his advertising campaigns than through his designs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecrowdblog.blogspot.com/ The CROWD blog].

On 17 July 2000, [[Dior Homme]] lead designer [[Patrick Lavoix]] was replaced by [[Hedi Slimane]]. Notable Dior releases that year were watches such as the distinctive "Malice", which features bracelets made of "CD" links, as well as the "Riva". Hedi left Dior Homme in 2007 and replaced by [[Kris Van Assche]].

===21st century===
In 2001, the Dior Homme boutique on 30 Avenue Montaigne reopened with a new "contemporary masculine concept" instilled by its designer Hedi Slimane. Slimane used this concept in the creation of his first Dior Homme collection.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; Soon, Dior Homme gained prominent male clientele including [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Mick Jagger]].&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

John Galliano then began to release his own Dior watches in 2001, beginning with the "Chris 47 Aluminum" line, marking a new era in Dior watch design. Next, the "Malice" and "Riva" watches were redesigned with precious stones to create the "Malice Sparkling" and "Riva Sparkling" spin-off collections. Inspired by the Spring-Summer 2002 Ready-to-Wear collection, Dior released the "Dior 66" watch, breaking many feminine traditional expectations in design.

[[File:Tokyo Ginza-Shopping Dior.JPG|thumb|The Dior flagship boutique in the upscale [[Ginza]] shopping district of Tokyo. First opened in 2004.]]
The men's fragrance "Higher" was released in 2001, followed by the perfume "Addict" in 2002. The company then opened [[Milan]]'s first Dior Homme boutique on 20 February 2002. By 2002, 130 locations were in full operation.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt; On 3 June 2002, Slimane was presented with the "International Designer of the Year" award by the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America|CFDA]]. Until 2002, [[Kanebo]] was the Christian Dior [[ready-to-wear]] license holder in Japan and, when the license expired, Christian Dior was able to profitable directly sell its [[ready-to-wear]] and accessories in its own boutiques.&lt;ref name="Luxury"&gt;{{cite book | title=Luxury Brand Management | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Chevalier, Michel | year=2012 | location=Singapore | isbn=978-1-118-17176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Chris 47 Steel" watch was released in 2003 as a cousin of the original "Chris 47 Aluminum". Bernard Arnault, his wife, [[Chloë Sevigny]], and [[Sidney Toledano]] witnessed the opening of the Dior flagship boutique in the [[Omotesandō]] district of Tokyo on 7 December 2003. The second Dior flagship store was opened in the upscale [[Ginza]] shopping district of Tokyo in 2004.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; An exclusive Dior Homme boutique was opened also that year in Paris on [[Rue Royale]], and it presented the entire Dior Homme collection. A second Dior Fine Jewelry boutique in Paris was opened at 8 Place Vendôme.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; A Christian Dior boutique was opened in Moscow after the company took control of licensed operations of its Moscow agent.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt;

The designer of Dior Fine Jewelry Victoire de Castellane launched her own watch named "Le D de Dior" (French: "The D of Dior"). signifying the entrance of Dior watches into its collection of fine Jewelry. This watch was designed for women but made use of many design features which are typically thought of as masculine. Slimane next released a watch for the Dior Homme collection called "Chiffre Rouge." This special watch included the signature look of Dior Homme: "Watch design and technology match each other inseparably, to create the perfect expression of Dior Homme’s artistic excellence and to increase the watchmaking legitimacy of Dior timepieces." De Castellane then launched her second line of watches called "La Baby de Dior". The design for this line was meant to be more feminine with more of a "jewelry look."

The "Miss Dior Chérie" perfume and the "Dior Homme" fragrance were released in 2005.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; Galliano released his "Dior Christal" watches in which he combined steel and blue sapphires to create a "creative and innovative collection." Christian Dior S.A. then celebrated the 13th anniversary of Dior Watches in 2005, and, in April of that year, its "Chiffre Rouge" collection was recognized by the World Watches and Jewelry Show in [[Basel, Switzerland]]. Also in the year, the fashion house also celebrated the 100th anniversary of the birthday of designer Christian Dior.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; An exhibition, "Christian Dior: Man of the Century," was held in the Dior Museum in [[Granville, Normandy]].

In 2006, the Dior watch booth was dedicated to the Dior [[caneworking|Canework]]. This pattern was made by designer Christian Dior and based on the [[Napoleon III style|Napoleon III]] chairs used in his fashion shows.

In 2007, Kris Van Assche was appointed as the new artistic director of Dior Homme. Van Assche presented his first collection later that year.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt; The 60th Anniversary of the founding of the Maison Dior was officially celebrated in 2007 as well.&lt;ref name="dior"/&gt;

By February 2011, the House of Dior was in scandal after accusations of John Galliano making anti-Semitic remarks made international headlines: the company found itself in a "public relations nightmare."&lt;ref name="NYTjuly2"/&gt; Galliano was fired in March and the scheduled presentation of his Fall-Winter 2011/2012 ready-to-wear collection went ahead without him, amid the controversy, on 4 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/04/dior-show-john-galliano_n_831290.html#248916|title=Dior Autumn/Winter 2011 Show Goes on Without John Galliano (PHOTOS)|date=4 March 2011|accessdate=7 July 2012|work=Huffington Post|first=Hilary|last=Moss}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the start of the show, chief executive Sydney Toledano gave a sentimental speech on the values of Christian Dior and alluded to the family's ties to the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG8362214/Sidney-Toledanos-emotional-speech-at-Christian-Dior-show.html|title=Sidney Toledano's emotional speech at Christian Dior show|date=4 March 2011|accessdate=7 July 2012|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show closed with the staff of the atelier coming out to accept applause in the absence of their artistic director. (The previous January 2011 presentation of Spring-Summer 2011 haute-couture was the last appearance of Galliano on the Dior runway.) The company went on ahead and appointed Bill Gaytten as head designer interim in absence of artistic director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | url = http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/john-galliano-replaced-with-bill-gaytten | title = A New Era | publisher = Vogue.co.uk | date = 2011-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaytten had worked under Galliano for Dior and for the John Galliano label. The first haute-couture collection (for the Fall-Winter 2011 season) under Gaytten's management was presented in July and was received with mainly negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/328206/20120415/dior-john-galliano-bill-gaytten-raf-simons.htm|title=Bill Gaytten's Spring Summer 12 Haute Couture Shanghai Show for Dior [PICTURES]|last=Thakur|first=Monami|work=International Business Times|date=15 April 2012|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gayttenfirstshow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2011/07/dior_couture_suffers_without_j.html|title=Dior Couture Suffers Without John Galliano|last=Odell|first=Amy|work=New York|date=5 July 2011|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, speculation remained for months as it was unknown who would be selected to replace Galliano. During its 13-month period of having no artistic director, Dior began undergoing subtle changes in its designs as the influence of the theatrical and flamboyant Galliano faded. The all-new resigned dior.com was launched in late 2011.

On 23 January 2012, Gaytten presented his second haute-couture collection (for the Spring-Summer 2012 season) for Dior and it was much better received than his first collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2012/01/gayttens-dior-couture-show-was-an-improvement.html|title=Bill Gaytten's Dior Couture Show Was Much Better Than Last Season's|last=Cowels|first=Charlotte|work=New York|date=23 January 2012|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgian designer [[Raf Simons]] was announced, on 11 April 2012, as the new artistic director of Christian Dior. Simons was known for his minimalist designs,&lt;ref name="guardianjuly2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/jul/02/raf-simons-show-christian-dior|title=Raf Simons puts doubts at rest with first show at Christian Dior|first=Jess|last=Cartner-Morley|work=The Guardian|date=2 July 2012|accessdate=7 July 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this contrasted against the dramatic previous designs of Dior under Galliano. Furthermore, Simons was seen to have emerged as a "dark horse" amid the names of other designers who were considered high contenders.&lt;ref name="NYTjuly2"/&gt; To emphasize the appropriate choice of Simons as the right designer, the company ostentatiously made comparisons between Simons and the original designer Christian Dior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dior.com/magazine/en_gb/News/Welcome-Mr-Simons |title=Welcome Mr Simons |publisher=Christian Dior |date=11 April 2012 |accessdate=7 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618204055/http://www.dior.com/magazine/en_gb/News/Welcome-Mr-Simons |archivedate=18 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Bernard Arnault and fellow executives at Dior and LVMH were keen to move Dior from the Galliano years.&lt;ref name="NYTjuly2"/&gt; Simons spent much time in the Dior archives&lt;ref name="thedailybeast"/&gt; and familiarizing himself with haute-couture (as he had no previous background in that niche of fashion).&lt;ref name="NYTjuly2"/&gt; Simons was then scheduled to debut his designs in July. Meanwhile, Gaytten's Spring-Summer 2012 haute-couture collection was presented as the first Dior haute-couture show ever to be held in China on 14 April in Shanghai;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dior.com/magazine/en_gb/News/Night-falls-over-Shanghai |title=Night Falls Over Shanghai |publisher=Christian Dior |date=15 April 2012 |accessdate=7 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628232505/http://www.dior.com/magazine/en_gb/News/Night-falls-over-Shanghai |archivedate=28 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was a mark of the company's devotion to its presence in the Chinese market.

It was highly buzzed about throughout various industry and social media sources as it was a display of Dior through its transition.

In March 2015 it was announced that [[Rihanna]] was chosen as the official spokeswoman for Dior; this makes her the first black woman to take the spokeswoman position at Dior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Avery Thompson |url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2015/03/14/rihanna-dior-campaign-first-black-woman/ |title=Rihanna’s Dior Campaign: Singer Is First Black Woman To Be Face Of Iconic Brand |publisher=Hollywood Life |date=2015-03-14 |accessdate=2015-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, [[Israel]]i model [[Sofia Mechetner]] was chosen to be the new face of [[Dior]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/07/12/how-a-14-year-old-israeli-teen-became-the-new-face-of-christian-dior/ How a 14-year-old Israeli became the new face of Christian Dior] By Ruth Eglash, [[The Washington Post]] Sunday, 12 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016 a new Dior flagship boutique opened in San Francisco, with a party hosted by [[Jaime King]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sfluxe.net/see-what-happened-at-diors-san-francisco-premiere/|title=» See What Happened at Dior’s San Francisco Premiere|last=Matthews|first=Damion|date=2016-04-23|website=SFLUXE|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Dior renovated and expanded its Madrid store. The brand celebrated the opening of the new boutique in a masked ball attended by a number of Spanish celebrities like Alejandro Gómez Palomo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/dior-celebrates-reopening-of-madrid-store-pedro-almodovar-rossy-de-palma-palomo-11055994/|title=Dior Celebrates Reopening of Madrid Store|last=Diderich|first=Joelle|date=2017-11-23|work=WWD|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celebrity Ambassadors===

Dior has created strong partnerships with Hollywood celebrities and social media influencers, working closely with these individuals to reach more demographics and re-establish its identity as a new, modern brand, despite the fact that it has been around for a while.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Gucci’s Digital Strategy Is Working|url=https://centricdigital.com/blog/digital-trends/why-guccis-digital-strategy-is-working/|website=Centric Digital|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has allowed the brand to portray a more populist image and attract a wider audience.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Mark|title=Luxury Brands and the Social Campaign|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/fashion/luxury-brands-and-the-social-campaign.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=18 March 2018|date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand has worked with and dressed contemporary style icons like [[Jennifer Lawrence]] and [[Lupita Nyong'o]], who may resonate with millennials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Carpet Retrospective: Dior|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/were-all-wearing-dior|website=Vogue|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dior has effectively implemented social media into their marketing communication strategy, in which images and videos from campaigns are shared on both the official Dior profile, and on the celebrity ambassadors' social media pages.

An example of this success is seen in the Secret Garden campaign featuring [[Rihanna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Here's Your First Look at Rihanna's Groundbreaking Dior Campaign|url=http://www.instyle.com/news/rihanna-christian-dior-secret-garden-campaign|website=InStyle.com|accessdate=18 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this campaign, Rihanna is seen dancing to a song from her album (''Only If For a Night'') through a hall of mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Iredale|first1=Jessica|title=Rihanna’s ‘Secret Garden’ Campaign for Dior Set to Debut|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/rihanna-dior-secret-garden-campaign-10128811/|website=WWD|accessdate=18 March 2018|date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By being associated with Rihanna's song, the company created a sense of association with her brand, which was beneficial to the company as she was ranked as the most marketable celebrity in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Rihanna became the most brand savvy celebrity|url=https://www.wgsn.com/blogs/how-rihanna-became-the-most-brand-savvy-celebrity/#|website=wgsn.com/blogs|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the reach not being completely suitable to the Dior target audience, collaborating with the likes of Rihanna allows the company to engage with more of the market, as Rihanna's social media following is four times larger than that of the fashion house.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==Criticism==

Christian Dior, together with others in the fashion industry and the culture of the industry as a whole, was criticized by fashion model Inga Radziejewski for promoting [[anorexia nervosa]] and unrealistic body image in women, by designing clothes so small that the anorexic model could not fit into them even when she was dangerously underweight.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/01/31/exposed-how-the-fashion-industry-rejected-anorexic-inga-as-too-big-115875-22007108/ "Sarah Arnold, Boudicca Fox-Leonard, "Exposed: How the Fashion Industry Rejected Anorexic Inga as 'Too Big'"]. ''[[The Daily Mirror]]''. 31 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galliano's collection inspired by homeless people also drew a lot of criticism, but also attention, to the house of Dior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/23/opinion/liberties-haute-homeless.html |work=The New York Times | first=Maureen | last=Dowd | title=Liberties; Haute Homeless | date=23 January 2000|accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spring 2017 collection also caused a lot of controversy as it was later revealed that many pieces were in fact exact replicas of traditional Romanian folk costumes. The refusal of Dior and of Maria Grazia Chiuri, the lead designer, to acknowledge the cultural appropriation, led to an online campaign under the hashtag #give credit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://stocknewsusa.com/2017/06/22/givecredit-campaign-continues-discovered-dior-also-copied-traditional-bukovinean-waistcoat/] The #GiveCredit Campaign Continues: it was discovered that Dior also copied a traditional Bukovinean waistcoat, 27 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galliano controversy==
On 23 February 2011, scandal arose when [[John Galliano]] was accused of making [[anti-semitic]] comments after drinking in Paris. Footage was released of the designer under the influence of alcohol saying "I love Hitler" and "People like you would be dead today. Your mothers, your forefathers would be fucking gassed and dead" to a Jewish woman.&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/02/28/2011-02-28_john_galliano_antisemitic_rant_caught_on_video_nicole_kidman_wore_dior_by_gallia.html John Galliano anti-Semitic rant caught on video; Slurs on camera 'I love Hitler']. Nydailynews.com (28 February 2011). Retrieved 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He was then accused of allegedly assaulting a gallery curator that same night and verbally insulting her and her boyfriend. Actress [[Natalie Portman]], who had recently become the new face of Miss Dior Cherie perfume, commented on the matter to express her disgust, stating that she will in no way be associated with him. However, another model for Dior, French actress [[Eva Green]], downplayed the seriousness of the incident, stating: "Sometimes, you can make mistakes. I don't think he's anti-semitic. I'm Jewish. I don't think he has anything against the Jews. I think it's more that he was probably a bit drunk."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/05/eva-green-interview-playing-evil Eva Green interview: "Playing evil"] by Elizabeth Day, [[The Observer]], Sunday 5 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February, Dior announced Galliano's suspension pending an investigation, citing that the company has a "zero-tolerance" policy toward anti-semitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmagazine.com/stylebeauty/news/natalie-portman-denounces-john-gallianos-anti-semitic-rant-201113 Natalie Portman Denounces John Galliano's Anti-Semitic Rant – Style &amp; Beauty]. ''Us Weekly''. Retrieved 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, it is against the law to make anti-semitic remarks of this nature, and it can be punished by up to six months in prison.&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt;

On 1 March 2011, Christian Dior officially announced that it had fired Galliano amidst the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Keaten, Jamey.

Retrieved 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plagiarism ==

In the [[United Kingdom]] (and particularly in [[England and Wales]]) the term '''county record office''' usually refers to a local authority repository, also called a county [[archive]]s.

Such repositories employ specialist staff to administer and conserve the historic and the semi-current records of the parent body. They usually also preserve written materials from a great variety of independent local organisations, churches and schools, prominent families and their estates, businesses, solicitors' offices and ordinary private individuals. 

Archives may have been acquired either through donation or (more generally) by deposit on long-term loan. Local authorities in certain larger cities sometimes administer their own separate '''city record office''', operating along similar lines. Archive repositories are frequently – but by no means exclusively – used by local and family historians for the purposes of original research, since many records can very often have a continuing administrative or legal significance.

==Facilities==
A record office will typically include public searchrooms (including reference books, archive catalogues and other finding aids), environmentally controlled strongrooms, administrative offices, and quite often small exhibition areas&lt;ref&gt;The relevant British Standard for the storage and exhibition of archives, both on and off the premises, is [[BS 5454]].&lt;/ref&gt; together with a conservation room for the specialist repair&lt;ref&gt;The relevant British Standard for the conservation and repair of documents is BS 4971.&lt;/ref&gt; of documents. Searchrooms are generally open at their advertised times without charge, although many offices operate a reader's ticket system. Some, but not all, operate a fee-paying postal service for those who are unable to make personal research visits. All county record offices attempt to work in accordance with the appropriate official [[British Standard]].

==Historical development of the UK archive network==
[[File:Hampshire Record Office, Sussex Street - geograph.org.uk - 1214346.jpg|thumb|[[Hampshire Record Office]], Sussex Street, Winchester]] 
The earliest county record office in the modern sense was the [[Bedfordshire Record Office]], established by [[George Herbert Fowler]] in 1913. To some extent it was operating within established traditions set by the London-based [[Public Record Office]] (now [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]), which first opened in 1838, or by other repositories overseas. Although the statutory operation of such county record offices under the [[Local Government (Records) Act 1962]] was permissive rather than mandatory, the network has gradually expanded. Bristol Record Office (now [[Bristol Archives]]), opened in 1924, has been identified as the second local office to become established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol.gov.uk/node/1295] Bristol Record Office website: "It was the first borough record office in the country and at the time there was only one other local record office in existence."  Retrieved 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The whole network now includes repositories – which operate largely independently of each other – throughout the whole of England and Wales (the most recent being Powys Archives, opened in the 1980s). Often the foundations of many of the earlier collections were the extensive surviving archives originating from a county's [[quarter session]]s – in the county of [[Somerset]] a special muniment room had actually been provided for these as early as 1617.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/AboutSRO.htm] Somerset Heritage Centre website – History of the Somerset Archive Service: "Somerset can claim a longer continuously-known history of official record keeping than any other county in England. A meeting of Quarter Sessions held at Wells in 1617 decided that a room should be provided 'for the safe keeping of the records of the Sessions'. By 1619 Somerset possessed not only its own record room, but also a room adjoining for the use of searchers. The record room stood next to the [[Chain Gate, Wells|Chain Gate]] on the north side of [[Wells Cathedral]], and remained in use for the next 200 years." Retrieved 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many broadly similar repositories in Scotland, Ireland, and overseas. To varying extents they will also help with the care of the county's semi-current or "modern records" using [[records management]] principles, as well as with the selection and preservation of today's records (both paper and digital) for future generations.

During the 19th and 20th centuries some older libraries had also begun to maintain archive collections from their local area, although their facilities and the scope of their collections could vary considerably – as  might their official legal status. There are often overlaps between local studies and record office collections, particularly with respect to printed ephemera, maps, photographs, old newspapers and local reference books. A number of record offices now operate in a formal association with one or more of their county’s principal local studies libraries, although the two professions of [[archivist]] and [[librarian]] generally remain quite distinct.

==Legal status for holding Public Records and other categories==

Public access to central government archives (technically known as '''Public Records''') and by extension to local government records was previously regulated in accordance with instruments such as the [[Public Records Act 1958]] and the [[Public Records Act 1967]]. The 1958 Act enabled county repositories to be appointed by the [[Lord Chancellor]] to hold individually specified classes of Public Records – including local court records.&lt;ref&gt;In practice any such appointments to hold Public Records (as defined by the 1958 Act), together with Manorial and Tithe records, are made on the recommendation of staff of the National Archives – formerly the Public Record Office – following inspections which can be repeated every few years.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to material within record  offices in England &amp; Wales is now largely regulated by the [[Data Protection Act 1998]] and the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]], although these do not necessarily cover privately deposited items, and closure periods may apply in certain cases.&lt;ref&gt;A summary of relevant legislation including the status of record offices was provided by Knightbridge A. A. H., ''Archive Legislation in the United Kingdom'' (Society of Archivists Information Leaflet, 1985), although this does not cover more recent changes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1929 many county record offices in England have also been designated by the local bishop as a [[diocesan record office]], latterly operating under the terms of the [[Parochial Registers and Records Measure 1978]]. Such record offices are often also formally recognised by the [[Master of the Rolls]] as approved repositories for manorial and tithe records (in accordance with the [[Law of Property Act 1922]] and the [[Tithe Act 1936]] (as amended by the [[Local Government Records Act 1962]]).&lt;ref&gt;HMSO: ''Record Repositories in Great Britain, a geographical directory'', 1992 {{ISBN|0-11-440243-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guides to the contents of record offices==

Many county record offices have issued printed guides to their collections, although the addition of new materials can make these go rapidly out of date. Furthermore, many offices also have considerable backlogs of uncatalogued materials. From the 1990s onwards an increasing number of offices have launched online catalogues of varying completeness, linked to their respective websites.

An earlier summary of archive repositories, including brief details of the development of each office together with outlines of their principal holdings, is provided by Janet Foster and Julia Sheppard’s ''British Archives'' (4th edition, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=British Archives: a guide to archive resources in the United Kingdom |editor1-first=Janet |editor1-last=Foster |editor2-first=Julia |editor2-last=Sheppard |edition=4th |location=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2002 |isbn=0333735366 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Select lists for certain specialised categories covering many UK repositories have also been issued by a variety of other publishers, notably the [[Federation of Family History Societies]].

'''''David''''' is the title of two statues of the biblical hero [[David]] by the Italian early Renaissance sculptor [[Donatello]]. They consist of an early work in [[marble]] of a clothed figure (1408-09), and a far more famous [[bronze]] figure that is nude between its helmet and boots, and dates to the 1430s or later. Both are now in the [[Museo Nazionale del Bargello]] in [[Florence]].

== The biblical text ==
The story of [[David and Goliath]] comes from 1 Samuel 17.  The Israelites are fighting the Philistines, whose best warrior – Goliath – repeatedly offers to meet the Israelites' best warrior in man-to-man combat to decide the whole battle.  None of the trained Israelite soldiers is brave enough to fight the giant Goliath, until David – a shepherd boy who is too young to be a soldier – accepts the challenge.  Saul, the Israelite leader, offers David armor and weapons, but the boy is untrained and refuses them.  Instead, he goes out with his sling, and confronts the enemy.  He hits Goliath in the head with a stone, knocking the giant down, and then grabs Goliath's sword and cuts off his head.  The Philistines withdraw as agreed and the Israelites are saved.  David's special strength comes from God, and the story illustrates the triumph of good over evil.&lt;ref&gt;Frontain, Raymond-Jean and Wojcik, Jan eds. (1980) ''The David Myth in Western Literature'', Purdue University Press, {{ISBN|0911198555}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The marble ''David''==
[[File:Donatello, david (marmo) 01.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The first version of ''David'' (1408–1409). [[Bargello|Museo Nazionale del Bargello]], [[Florence]]. Height 191 cm.]]
[[Donatello]], then in his early twenties, was commissioned to carve a statue of David in 1408, to top one of the [[buttress]]es of [[Florence Cathedral]], though it was never to be placed there. [[Nanni di Banco]] was commissioned to carve a marble statue of [[Isaiah]], at the same scale, in the same year.  One of the statues was lifted into place in 1409, but was found to be too small to be easily visible from the ground and was taken down; both statues then languished in the workshop of the ''opera'' for several years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Janson|Janson]], pp. 3–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Hennessey, John (1958) ''Italian Renaissance Sculpture,'' London, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Poeschke|Poeschke]], p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1416, the [[Signoria of Florence]] commanded that the ''David'' be sent to their [[Palazzo della Signoria]]; evidently the young David was seen as an effective political symbol, as well as a religious hero. Donatello was asked to make some adjustments to the statue (perhaps to make him look less like a prophet), and a pedestal with an inscription was made for it:  PRO PATRIA FORTITER DIMICANTIBUS ETIAM ADVERSUS TERRIBILISSIMOS HOSTES DII PRAESTANT AUXILIUM ("To those who fight bravely for the fatherland the gods lend aid even against the most terrible foes").&lt;ref&gt;Documents on the statue may be found in [[#Omaggio|''Omaggio a Donatello'']], pp. 126–127. On the political implications of David for early-modern Florence, see Andrew Butterfield, ”New Evidence for the Iconography of David in Quattrocento Florence,”  ''I Tatti Studies '' 6 (1995) 114–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

The marble ''David'' is Donatello's earliest known important commission, and it is a work closely tied to tradition, giving few signs of the innovative approach to representation that the artist would develop as he matured.  Although the positioning of the legs hints at a classical [[contrapposto]], the figure stands in an elegant Gothic sway that surely derives from [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]].  The face is curiously blank (curiously, that is, if one expects naturalism, but very typical of the Gothic style), and David seems almost unaware of the head of his vanquished foe that rests between his feet.  Some scholars have seen an element of personality – a kind of cockiness -(contrapposto=relaxed stance, shifted weight) suggested by the twist of the torso and the akimbo placement of the left arm,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Poeschke|Poeschke]], p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Omaggio|''Omaggio a Donatello'']], p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; but overall the effect of the figure is rather bland.  However it was intended to be gilded and painted, set on a pedestal with [[mosaic]], and also seen from a considerable distance below.  Donatello distorted the proportions of the figure to allow for this angle of view. The head of Goliath, lying at David's feet, "is carved with great assurance and reveals the young sculptor’s genuinely Renaissance interest in an ancient Roman type of mature, bearded head".&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

== The bronze ''David'' ==
[[Donatello]]'s [[bronze statue]] of David (circa 1440s)  is famous as the first unsupported standing work of [[bronze]] cast during the [[Renaissance]], and the first freestanding nude [[male]] sculpture made since antiquity.  It depicts David with an enigmatic smile, posed with his foot on [[Goliath]]'s severed head just after defeating the giant. The youth is completely naked, apart from a [[Bay laurel|laurel]]-topped hat and boots, bearing the sword of Goliath.
[[File:Donatello, David (bronze), side view.jpg|thumb|upright|Left side of Donatello's ''David''.]]

The creation of the work is entirely undocumented, and it has been given a range of datings. According to one theory, it was commissioned by the [[House of Medici|Medici family]] in the 1430s to be placed in the centre of the courtyard of the old Medici Palace. Alternatively it may have been for that position in the new [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]], where it certainly was placed later, which would place the commission in the mid-1440s or even later.  The statue is recorded there by Vasari and other sources.&lt;!-- Sounds very dubious to me:  This daring move showed that the Medici family thought that they could take ownership of David, a symbol of the city of Florence.  Because this was such a scandalous idea at the time, Donatello put some shifts on the subject matter that could explain away the identity of David as "just another sculpture". Goliath's helmet has a feather protruding that can be seen as attached to David's foot, and thus characterized as Hermes, the Greek god.  The David also has slight breasts which could classify him as a woman if seen from the side where his leg is blocking his testicles.  --&gt; The Medici family were exiled from Florence in 1494, and the statue was moved to the courtyard of the [[Palazzo della Signoria]] (the marble ''David'' was already in the palazzo).  It was moved to the [[Palazzo Pitti]] in the 17th century, to the [[Uffizi]] in 1777, and then finally, in 1865, to the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, where it remains today.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Janson|Janson]], pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Poeschke|Poeschke]], p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Omaggio|''Omaggio a Donatello'']], pp. 196–197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randolph, Adrian W.B. (2002) ''Engaging Symbols:  Gender, Politics, and Public Art in Fifteenth-Century Florence,'' New Haven, pp. 139–141, {{ISBN|0300092121}}. Randolph published a poem from 1466 that seems to describe the statue in the Medici palace.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]], the statue stood on a column designed by [[Desiderio da Settignano]] in the middle of the courtyard of the Palazzo Medici; an inscription seems to have explained the statue's significance as a political monument. Giorgio Vasari, ''Le Vite...,'' ed. G. Milanesi, Florence, 1878–1885, III, 108.  A quattrocento manuscript containing the text of the inscription is probably an earlier reference to the statue; unfortunately the manuscript is not dated. Although a political meaning for the statue is widely accepted, exactly what that meaning is has been a matter of considerable debate among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Political readings of the ''David'' include {{cite journal|author=Sperling, Christine M.|title=Donatello's Bronze 'David' and the Demands of Medici Politics|journal=The Burlington Magazine|volume=134|year=1992|pages=218–219|url=http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/~bevans/donatello%20bronze%20david%20medici%20politics.pdf|jstor=885118}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;br&gt; {{cite journal|author=Crum, Roger J. |title=Donatello's Bronze ''David'' and the Question of Foreign versus Domestic Tyranny|doi=10.1111/j.1477-4658.1996.tb00364.x|journal=Renaissance Studies|volume= 10 |year=1996|pages= 440–450|issue=4}}&lt;br&gt; {{cite journal|author= McHam, Sarah Blake|title=Donatello's Bronze ''David'' and ''Judith'' as Metaphors of Medici Rule in Florence|jstor=3177189|journal=Art Bulletin|volume= 83 |year=2001|pages= 32–47|doi= 10.2307/3177189}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite journal|author=  Terry, Allie|title=Donatello's decapitations and the rhetoric of beheading in Medicean Florence|doi=10.1111/j.1477-4658.2009.00593.x|journal=Renaissance Studies|volume= 23 |year=2009|pages= 609–638|issue=  5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars assume the statue was commissioned by [[Cosimo de' Medici]], but the date of its creation is unknown and widely disputed; suggested dates vary from the 1420s to the 1460s ([[Donatello]] died in 1466), with the majority opinion recently falling in the 1440s, when the new Medici Palace designed by [[Michelozzo]] was under construction.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhalgh, M. (1982) ''Donatello and His Sources'', London, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;  The iconography of the bronze ''David'' follows that of the marble ''David'':  a young hero stands with sword in hand, the severed head of his enemy at his feet.  Visually, however, this statue is startlingly different. David is both physically delicate and remarkably effeminate.  The head has been said to have been inspired by classical sculptures of [[Antinous]], a favorite of Hadrian renowned for his beauty. The statue's physique contrasted with the absurdly large sword in hand, shows that David has overcome Goliath not by physical prowess, but through [[God]]. However, the intention of Donatello is still debated among scholars. The boy's nakedness further implies the idea of the presence of God, contrasting the youth with the heavily-[[armor]]ed giant. David is presented uncircumcised, which is generally customary for male nudes in Italian Renaissance art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Steinberg, Leo |title=Michelangelo and the Doctors|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|volume= 56 |year=1982|pages= 552–553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
[[File:Donatello, David (bronze) detail of legs.JPG|thumb|upright|Back view of the legs of the ''David'' in the [[Bargello|Museo Nazionale del Bargello]], Florence.]]
There are no indications of contemporary responses to the ''David.'' However, the fact that the statue was not placed in the town hall of Florence in the 1490s indicates that it was viewed as controversial. In the early 16th century, the Herald of the [[Signoria]] mentioned the sculpture in a way that suggested there was something unsettling about it: "The David in the courtyard is not a perfect figure because its right leg is tasteless."&lt;ref&gt;Gaye, G. (1840) ''Carteggio inedito d'artisti dei secoli xiv.xv.xvi.,'' 3 vols., Florence, II: 456: "El Davit della corte è una figura et non è perfecta, perchè la gamba sua di drieto è schiocha."  Cited in Shearman, John (1992) ''Only Connect...Art and the Spectator in the Italian Renaissance,'' Princeton:  Princeton University Press, 22 n. 17.  Shearman notes that ''schiocha'' could be translated as "imprudent" or "stupid."&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-century [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] was describing the statue as so naturalistic that it must have been made from life.  However, among 20th- and 21st-century art historians there has been considerable controversy about how to interpret it. 

The beard on the severed head curls around David's sandaled foot.  Goliath is wearing a winged helmet.  David's right foot stands firmly on the short right wing, while the left wing, considerably longer, works its way up his right leg to his groin.

The figure has been interpreted in a variety of ways.  One has been to suggest that Donatello was homosexual and that he was expressing that sexual attitude through this statue.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Janson|Janson]], pp. 77–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schneider, Laurie |title=Donatello's Bronze David|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume= 55 |year=1973|pages= 213–216|jstor=3049095|doi=10.2307/3049095|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second is to suggest that the work refers to homosocial values in Florentine society without expressing Donatello's personal tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Randolph, Adrian W.B. (2002) ''Engaging Symbols:  Gender, Politics, and Public Art in Fifteenth-Century Florence,'' New Haven, pp. 139–192, {{ISBN|0300092121}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raymondjeanfrontain"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.glreview.com/issues/13.4/13.4-frontain.php| title= The Fortune in David’s Eyes| work= GLRW| author= Frontain, Raymond-Jean| access-date= 2012-08-01| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090319180818/http://www.glreview.com/issues/13.4/13.4-frontain.php| archive-date= 2009-03-19| dead-url= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the time of the Renaissance, when the statue was created, sodomy was illegal, and over 14,000 people had been tried in Florence for this crime.&lt;ref&gt;PBS documentary "The Medici", 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  So this homosexual implication was very risky and dangerous.  A third interpretation is that ''David'' represents Donatello's effort to create a unique version of the male nude, to exercise artistic license rather than copy the classical models that had thus far been the sources for the depiction of the male nude in Renaissance art.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Poeschke|Poeschke]], p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change in identification===
[[File:David di donatello, mostra a milano 01.jpg|thumb|Detail of the base]]
The traditional identification of the figure was first questioned in 1939 by Jeno Lanyi, with an interpretation leaning toward ancient mythology, the hero's helmet especially suggesting [[Hermes]]. A number of scholars over the last 70 years have followed Lanyi,  sometimes referring to the statue as ''David-Mercury''.&lt;ref&gt;Lanyi never published his hypothesis; his ideas were made public in John Pope-Hennessey (1984) “Donatello’s Bronze David," ''Scritti di storia dell’arte in onore di Federico Zeri'' Milan: Electa, pp. 122–127, and further developed in Paroncchi, Alessandro (1980) ''Donatello e il potere,'' Florence, pp. 101–115 and Fossi, G. ''et al.'' (2000) ''Italian Art'', Florence, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; If the figure were indeed meant to represent [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], it may be supposed that he stands atop the head of the vanquished giant [[Argus Panoptes]].  However, this identification is certainly mistaken; all [[quattrocento]] references to the statue firmly identify it as David.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, John (1992) ''Only Connect...Art and the Spectator in the Italian Renaissance,'' Princeton:  Princeton University Press, pp. 20–21, {{ISBN|9780691099729}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===
The statue underwent restoration from June 2007 to November 2008.  This was the first time the statue had ever been restored, but concerns about layers of "mineralized waxings" on the surface of the bronze led to the 18-month intervention. The statue was scraped with scalpels (on the non-gilded areas) and lasered (on the gilded areas) to remove surface build-up.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070702015209/http://www.polomuseale.firenze.it/restaurodonatello/ Il Restauro del David di Donatello].

=== Copies and influence ===
There is a full-size [[plaster cast]] (with a broken sword) in the [[Cast Courts (Victoria and Albert Museum)|Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[London]]. There is also a full-size white marble copy in the Temperate House at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], Surrey, a few miles outside central London. In addition to the copies in the [[United Kingdom]], there is also another copy at the [[Slater Memorial Museum|Slater Museum]] at the [[Norwich Free Academy]] in [[Norwich, Connecticut]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.courant.com/2002-07-14/features/0207141124_1_greatest-sculptures-dusting-museum-work |title=Dusting |author=Shana Sureck |publisher=''[[Hartford Courant]]'' |date=July 14, 2002 |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David continued to be a subject of great interest for Italian patrons and artists.  Later representations of the Biblical hero include [[Antonio del Pollaiuolo]]'s ''David'' (Berlin, [[Berlin State Museums|Staatliche Museen]], c. 1470, panel painting), [[David (Verrocchio)|Verrocchio's ''David'']] (Florence, [[Bargello]], 1470s, bronze),  [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]'s ''David'' (Florence, [[Santa Maria Novella|S. Maria Novella]], c. 1485, fresco), [[Bartolomeo Bellano]]'s ''David'' (New York, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 1470s, bronze), [[David (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo's ''David'']] (Florence, [[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Accademia]], 1501-1504, marble), and [[David (Bernini)|Bernini's ''David'']], (Rome, [[Galleria Borghese]], 1623–24, marble).

[[File:PaulT.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Paul]] Writing His Epistles'', by [[Valentin de Boulogne]] or [[Nicolas Tournier]] (c. 16th century, Blaffer Foundation Collection, Houston, TX).]]

An '''epistle''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|p|ɪ|s|əl}}; {{lang-el|ἐπιστολή}}, ''epistolē,'' "letter") is a writing directed or sent to a person or group of people, usually an elegant and formal [[Didacticism|didactic]] letter.  The epistle genre of letter-writing was common in [[ancient Egypt]] as part of the [[Scribe|scribal-school]] writing curriculum. The letters in the [[New Testament]] from [[Twelve apostles|Apostles]] to [[Early Christianity|Christians]] are usually referred to as epistles. Those traditionally attributed to [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] are known as [[Pauline epistles]] and the others as [[General epistles|catholic (i.e., "general") epistles]].

==Ancient Argon epistles==
The [[Ancient Egyptian literature|ancient Egyptians]] wrote epistles, most often for [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] reasons. [[Egyptologist]] Edward Wente (1990) speculates that the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Fifth-dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Djedkare Isesi]]—in his many letters sent to his [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|viziers]]—was a pioneer in the epistolary genre.&lt;ref name=wente&gt;{{cite book|title=Letters from Ancient Egypt: Society of Biblical Literature Writing from the Ancient World Series Volume 1|year=1990|publisher=Scholars Press|location=Atlanta, GA|isbn=978-1555404734|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/heb.02262.0001.001|author=Edward F. Wente|translator = Edmund S. Meltzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its existence is firmly attested during the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] of the [[Old Kingdom]], and is prominently featured in the educational guide ''The Book of Kemit'' written during the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=wente/&gt; A standardized formulae for epistolary compositions existed by the time of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]]. The epistolary formulae used in the [[Ramesside Period]] found its roots in the letters composed during the [[Amarna Period]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]]. Wente describes the "Satirical Letter" found on the [[Papyrus Anastasi&amp;nbsp;I]] of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]] as an epistle which was commonly copied as a writing exercise by Egyptian schoolchildren on ceramic [[ostraca]] (over eighty examples of which have been found so far by archaeologists). Epistle letters were also written to the dead, and, by the Ramesside Period, to the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|gods]]; the latter became even more widespread during the eras of [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian]] and [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Greek]] domination.&lt;ref name=wente/&gt;

==Ancient Greece and Rome==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Epistles in prose and verse were a major genre of literature among the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and particularly the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The letters of [[Cicero]] are one of the most important sources on the history of the late [[Roman Republic]] and preserve features of colloquial [[Latin]] not always in evidence in his speeches and treatises. The letters of [[Pliny the Younger]] likewise are studied as both examples of Latin prose with self-conscious literary qualities and sources for historical information. [[Ovid]] produced three collections of verse epistles, composed in [[elegiac couplet]]s: the ''[[Heroides]]'', letters written in the person of legendary women to their absent lovers; and the ''[[Tristia]]'' and ''[[Ex Ponto]]'', written in first person during the poet's [[Ovid#Exile to Tomis|exile]]. The epistles of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], with their moral or philosophical ruminations, influenced later [[Church Fathers|patristic]] writers.

==Form of Christian epistles==
Epistles are written in strict accordance to formalized, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] tradition, especially the [[Pauline epistles]]. This reflects the amount of Hellenistic influence upon the epistle writers. Any deviancy is not the result of accident but indicates an unusual motive of the writer.

===Opening===
In contrast to modern letters, epistles usually named the author at the very beginning, followed by the recipient (for example, see [[Philippians]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians%201:1;&amp;version=31; 1:1]). The scribe (or more correctly, the [[amanuensis]]) who wrote down the letter may be named at the end of the ''episte'' (e.g., [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%2016:22;&amp;version=31; 16:22]). In the absence of a [[postal system]], the [[courier]] may also be named (e.g. [[Ephesians]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%206:21-22;&amp;version=31; 6:21–22]).

After the names of the author and recipient, Pauline epistles often open with the greeting, "Grace and peace to you." "Grace" was a common Hellenistic greeting, while "peace" ([[shalom]]) was the common [[Judaism|Jewish]] greeting; this reflected Paul's dual identity in Jewish faith and Hellenistic culture. There may also be a word of thanks to the audience. In secular letters, a prayer or wish for health followed.

===Body===
The body begins with a brief statement introducing the main topic of the entire body.

==New Testament epistles==
The epistles of the [[New Testament]] canon are usually divided as follows:

===Pauline Epistles===

== Epistles of Apostolic Fathers ==
These are letters written by some very early Christian leaders, in the 1st or 2nd century, which are not part of the [[New Testament]]. They are generally considered to form part of the basis of Christian tradition. The ennobling word "epistle" is used partly because these were all written in Greek, in a time period close to when the epistles of the New Testament were written, and thus "epistle" lends additional weight of authority.

==Liturgical use==&lt;!-- Epistle (liturgy) redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Epistle to Galatians Illuminatad.jpg|thumb|Opening of the Epistle to the Galatians, [[illuminated manuscript]] for reading during [[Christian liturgy]].]]
In the context of a [[liturgy]], epistle may refer more specifically to a particular passage from a New Testament epistle (the Pauline epistles and the [[General epistles]])—sometimes also from the [[Book of Acts]] or the [[Revelation of John]], but not the [[Four Gospels]]—that is scheduled to be read on a certain day or at a certain occasion.

===Western churches===
In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] [[Eucharist]], epistles are read between the [[Collect]] and the [[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel]] reading. The corresponding [[Gregorian chant]]s have a special tone (''tonus epistolae''). When the epistle is sung or chanted at [[Solemn Mass]] it is done so by the [[subdeacon]]. Epistles are also read by an [[Elder (Christianity)#Lutheranism|Elder]] or [[Bishop#Lutheranism|Bishop]] in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]], between the [[gradual]] and the Gospel.

===Eastern churches===
[[File:Kniga Apostol 1632 Drukarnya S Sobal.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Kniga Apostol'' (1632), [[lectionary]] in [[Church Slavonic]] for use in the [[Divine Liturgy]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].]]
In the [[Divine Liturgy]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Byzantine Rite Catholic]]s the Epistle reading is called the ''Apostol'' (the same name is given to the [[lectionary]] from which it is read). The Apostol includes the Acts of the Apostles as well as the Epistles, but never the [[Apocalypse]] (Revelation of John).  Unlike the [[Latin Rite]] there are never readings from the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Apostle (in Liturgy)}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are Epistle [[lection|lessons]] for every day of the year, except for weekdays during [[Great Lent]], when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated. These daily Epistle readings are a part of the [[Paschal cycle]], being ultimately dependent upon the date of [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter). There are also lessons appointed for the [[feast day]]s of numerous [[saint]]s and commemorations. There may be one, two, or three readings from the Apostol during a single Liturgy. The Epistle is read between the [[Prokeimenon]] and the [[Alleluia]]. The Epistle reading is always linked to a reading from the [[Gospel]], though some services, such as [[Matins]], will have a Gospel lesson, but no Epistle. A number of services besides the Divine Liturgy will have an Epistle and Gospel reading. Such services often include a Prokeimenon and Alleluia as well. The Epistle is chanted by the [[Reader (liturgy)|reader]], though at a Hierarchical Liturgy (a Divine Liturgy celebrated by a [[bishop]]), it is read by a [[deacon]]. The one who chants the Epistle also reads the verses of the [[Prokeimenon]].'''

==Medieval Epistles==
During the [[Middle Ages]], the art of letter writing was taught in numerous manuals, and the [[ars dictaminis]] became an important genre of instructional discourse. The necessity for letter writing was in large part due to the general deterioration of civil life and the decay of the [[Roman roads|Roman road]] system in the early [[Middle Ages]], factors that obliged literate people with business to transact to send letters instead of travel themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Malcolm |editor-first1=Carol |editor-last1 =Poster | editor-first2=Linda C. |editor-last2=Mitchell | title= Letter-Writing Manuals and Instruction from Antiquity to the Present: Historical and Bibliographic Studies |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |location= Columbia, SC |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zGhKNwuFvlwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date= 2007 |pages= 52–66 |chapter= The ''Art dictaminis'', the Formulary, and Medieval Epistolary Practice |isbn=978-1570036514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A vast number of letters and letter-writing manuals were written in the period's ''lingua franca'', [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Poster |first1=Carol |last2=Utz |first2=Richard |editor-first1=Carol |editor-last1 =Poster | editor-first2=Linda C. |editor-last2=Mitchell | title= Letter-Writing Manuals and Instruction from Antiquity to the Present: Historical and Bibliographic Studies |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |location= Columbia, SC |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zGhKNwuFvlwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date= 2007 |pages= 285–300 |chapter= Appendix&amp;nbsp;B: A Bibliography of Medieval Latin ''Dictamen'' |isbn=978-1570036514 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ExilesOnAsperus.jpg|thumb|First edition, cover art by Colin Hay]]

'''''Exiles on Asperus''''' ({{ISBN|0-340-24046-6}}) is a collection of [[science fiction]] short stories by [[John Wyndham]], writing as John Benyon, published in 1979 after his death by [[Coronet Books]].

The collection contains:

*Exiles on Asperus (1933)
*No Place Like Earth (1951)
*The Venus Adventure (1932)

Exiles tells the story of a human crew who are transporting a group of Martian dissidents to a penal colony only for the captives to revolt leading to the crew, prisoners, and the survivors of a previous crash becoming embroiled in a battle for survival against the indigenous life form of the planet Asperus.

No Place Like Earth sees a survivor of the Earth's destruction facing a slow, quiet life on Mars or becoming part of the efforts to keep humanity alive on Venus, and the repercussions of his decision.

The Venus Adventure tells of an early flight to Venus and the surprising world the crew of the Fyra discover. Not only are there intelligent indigenous lifeforms, and a breathable atmosphere, there are also fellow humans.

'''The Feminist Press''' is an independent nonprofit literary publisher that promotes freedom of expression and social justice. It publishes writing by people who share an activist spirit and a belief in choice and equality. Founded in 1970, the Press began by rescuing “lost” works by writers such as [[Zora Neale Hurston]] and [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], and established its publishing program with books by American writers of diverse racial and class backgrounds. Since then it has also been bringing works from around the world to North American readers. The Feminist Press is the longest surviving women’s publishing house in the world. The Press operates out of the [[City University of New York]] (CUNY).

== Founding and history ==
By the end of the 1960s, both [[Florence Howe]] and her husband Paul Lauter had taught in the [[Freedom Schools]] in Mississippi, and Howe was already attempting to compile a mini-women’s studies curriculum for her writing students at [[Goucher College]] in Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Kathleen|title=Florence Howe|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/howe-florence#bibliography|work=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 1970s approached, Howe was convinced that, just as she needed texts for teaching about women, so would other educators. Her initial appeal to a number of university and trade publishers to issue a series of critical feminist biographies&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Florence. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1971/jul/01/feminist-press/?pagination=false "To the Editors"], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. Retrieved January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; proved of no avail. Ultimately, the Baltimore Women’s Liberation, an active local group and publishers of a successful new journal, helped to raise money for the Press’s first publications. On November 17, 1970, the first meeting of the newly formed Press occurred in Florence Howe's living-room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs044/1101707198155/archive/1106954679579.html "VFA Honors the Founder of The Feminist Press Florence Howe"]. Veteran Feminists of America. Retrieved January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The first book to be published was Barbara Danish’s children's book ''The Dragon and the Doctor'' in 1971.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book | last = Howe | first = Florence | author-link = | title = A Life in Motion | publisher = The Feminist Press | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781558616974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Florence Howe saw her dreams of producing feminist biographies come true with the publication of ''Elizabeth Barrett Browning'' at the end of 1971.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In the Press’s founding years, [[Tillie Olsen]] changed its course dramatically by giving Howe a photocopy of the 1861 pages of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' containing [[Rebecca Harding Davis]]'s anonymously published novella ''[[Life in the Iron Mills]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bosman|first=Julie|title=Tillie Olsen, Feminist Writer, Dies at 94|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/books/03olsen.html?_r=0|accessdate=10 January 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the Press issued this work by Rebecca Harding Davis as the first of its series of rediscovered feminist literary classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Howe | first = Florence | author-link = | title = Lost and found – and what happened next: some reflections on the search for women writers begun by The Feminist Press in 1970 | journal = [[Contemporary Women's Writing]], special issue: The Body | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 136–153 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/cww/vpt022 | date = July 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cww/vpt022 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olsen’s second suggestion, ''[[Daughter of Earth]]'' by [[Agnes Smedley]], and [[Elaine Hedges]]’s suggestion, ''[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]'' by [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], were published in 1973, and both of these have become staples of the American literature and women’s studies curriculums since (the 1990 ''[[Norton Anthology of American Literature]]'' included both ''Life in the Iron Mills'' and ''The Yellow Wall-Paper''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe| author-link = |title=A Life in Motion|date=2011|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

In the spring of 1971, Florence and her husband moved to New York.  Howe brought the burgeoning press with her to her newly accepted professorship at Old Westbury.  The President of the school allowed her to operate out of the corridor of a building originally intended as a garage for campus vehicles.  The Press was met with excitement and support from students who worked in the small office in exchange for college work-study.  Two New York City publishing professionals, Verne Moberg and Susan Lowes, contributed to the publication of three volumes of reprinted fiction released in 1972 and 1973, both of which Howe believes to exemplify the Press's enduring commitment to producing course-adoptable books to supplement curriculums dominated by male writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe| author-link = |title=A Life in Motion|date=2011|publisher=|location= |isbn=|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Press continues its commitment to recovering and compiling the important work of otherwise overlooked and unpublished female artists in collections such as ''In Her Own Image''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hedges | first1 = Elaine | last2 = Wendt | first2 = Ingrid | author-link2 = Ingrid Wendt | title = In Her Own Image: Women Working in the Wrts | publisher = The Feminist Press [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill Book Co.]] | location = Old Westbury, New York, NY | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780070204430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Women Writing Africa'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Daymond | first1 = M. J. | title = Women writing Africa, Volume I: The Southern Region | publisher = The Feminist Press | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781558614079 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the Feminist Press became a [[501(c)3 organization]] with tax-exempt status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe| author-link =|title=A Life in Motion|date=2011|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1985, the Feminist Press moved to the CUNY campus on East Ninety-Fourth Street following an invitation from the school.  Allowed to maintain an independent staff and board of directors, the Press gratefully welcomed the resources and visibility made available by this partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe| author-link = |title=A Life in Motion|date=2011|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Jean Casella became the Executive Director of the Press.  She was followed by Gloria Jacobs, former ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'' editor, and [[Jennifer Baumgardner]], Soapbox Inc. cofounder. [[Jamia Wilson]] is the current Executive Director of the Feminist Press, appointed in 2017.

== Today ==
Wilson is both the youngest director in the Press's 47-year history and the first woman of color to head the organization. Under her tutelage, the Press continues its commitment to publishing a broad range of voices. However, the Press has also recently endeavored to extend its reaches beyond merely publishing. In doing so, the Press has hosted a variety of events, conferences, and panels centering on key conversations in feminism.

“I grew up reading Feminist Press books from my mother’s shelf, and they were instrumental in developing my voice as an activist and writer. It’s an honor to join this intergenerational team to enliven the Press’s intersectional vision of publishing unapologetic, accessible texts that inspire action, teach empathy, and build community,” Wilson explained upon her appointment as ED.

The Feminist Press remains rooted in the symbiotic relationship between a publication and its readership. In this exchange, a book not only promotes ideas to its reader, but it also inspires new formulations that could ultimately shape future publications.

The Feminist Press has remained current and relevant within the fast-changing world of modern politics and the rapid evolution of feminism. In 2016, the Press started Amethyst Editions, a queer imprint curated by Michelle Tea that champions emerging queer writers who employ genre-bending narratives and experimental writing styles, and complicates the conversation around American LGBTQ+ experiences beyond a coming out narrative. The Feminist Press also established the Louise Meriwether First Book Prize, a literary prize for debut women and nonbinary authors of color, in partnership with ''TAYO'' literary magazine.

== ''WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly'' ==
The Feminist Press also publishes ''[[WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly]]'', an interdisciplinary peer-reviewed academic journal. The journal began as ''Women's Studies Newsletter'' in 1972, and in 1981 it was renamed ''Women's Studies Quarterly''.&lt;ref name=About_FP&gt;{{cite web|title=About FP|url=https://www.feministpress.org/about-fp/history | publisher = The Feminist Press |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today it is a biannual release simply called ''WSQ''.  Covering a wide array of thematic subjects within emerging women's studies, the journal has published issues such as "Technologies," "Citizenship," and "Motherhood."  The subject of each issue is considered through various lenses that may include psychoanalytic, legal, queer, and historical interpretations in addition to many others.

== Series ==
The Feminist Press has launched multiple book series.  ''Women Writing Africa'' was begun in 1994 with funding from the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations.&lt;ref name=About_FP /&gt; The four-volume series was completed in 2009.  Like the two-volume ''Women Writing India,'' the series is composed of regionally unique women's literature.  The Femmes Fatales series, featuring pulp, mystery, and noir novels by women writing in the 1930s, '40s, and '50s was launched in 2003, and includes recent releases such as the 2013 ''Return to Lesbos.''

The '''Free Secession''' ({{lang-de|Freie Secession}}) was an association of [[modern art]]ists in [[Berlin]] organizing joint exhibitions 1914–1923.&lt;ref name="Schubert 2010"/&gt;

The Free Secession was formed after 42 members in late 1913 left the [[Berlin Secession]], which thereby lost a majority of its members and nearly all of its most prominent artists.&lt;ref name="DB ML"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KK 2013"/&gt; [[Max Liebermann]], a former co-founder and leader of the Berlin Secession was made honorary president of the Free Secession.

[[File:Arthur Boyd Houghton00.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Arthur Boyd Houghton]] cartoon published by ''Fun'' magazine in 1886]]
'''''Fun''''' was a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] weekly [[magazine]], first published on 21 September 1861.&lt;ref&gt;''Fun'', volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was founded by the actor and playwright [[H. J. Byron]] in competition with ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine. ''Fun'' ceased publication in 1901, when it was absorbed into ''Sketchy Bits''.

==Description==
[[Image:Darwin sexual caricature.gif|thumb|upright|Caricature of Darwin contemplating a [[bustle]], from ''Fun'', 16th Nov, 1872]]
Like ''Punch'', the journal published satiric verse and parodies, as well as political and literary criticism, sports and travel information. These were often illustrated or accompanied by topical cartoons (often of a political nature). The ''Punch'' mascot, Mr. Punch, and his dog Toby were lampooned by Fun's jester, Mr. Fun, and his cat.&lt;ref name=storyboard&gt;[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/projects/disraeli/funstoryboard.html ''Fun'' (1861–1901)], [[Bodleian Library]], accessed 21 July 2012 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206171634/http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/projects/disraeli/funstoryboard.html |date=2007-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was aimed at a well-educated readership interested in politics, literature, and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Vann, J. Don, "Comic Periodicals," in ''Victorian Periodicals &amp; Victorian Society'' (Aldershot: Scholar Press, 1994), pp. 284-5)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fun'' was sold for a penny and was sometimes characterised as a 'poor man's ''Punch'''. [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]] called it "Funch".&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Alvin, ''British Literary Magazines: The Victorian and Edwardian Age'', 1837-1913 (London: Greenwood Press, 1984), p. 135)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fun'' silenced its critics by publishing lively fare, whereas ''Punch'' was criticised as dull and tired. One area in which ''Fun'' clearly bested its rival was in its close connection to popular theatre.

Byron and his successor as editor, [[Tom Hood]], the son of the first ''Punch'' contributor, assembled a vivacious, bohemian and progressive staff. Notable contributors included playwrights [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]], Hood, [[Clement Scott]], [[F. C. Burnand]] (who defected to ''Punch'' in 1862), satirist [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[G. R. Sims]] and especially [[W. S. Gilbert]], whose [[Bab Ballads]] were almost all published in its pages, among other articles, poems, illustrations and drama criticism over a ten-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stedman|first=Jane W.|year=1996|title=W. S. Gilbert &amp;ndash; A Classic Victorian and His Theatre|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press}}, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Cartoonists included [[Arthur Boyd Houghton]], [[Matt Morgan (cartoonist)|Matt Morgan]] and James Francis Sullivan (1852–1936). The ''Fun'' gang frequented the Arundel Club, the [[Savage Club]], and especially Evans's café, where they had a table in competition with the ''Punch'' 'Round table'.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://journals.mup.man.ac.uk/cgi-bin/pdfdisp//MUPpdf/NCTF/V30I2/300001.pdf Schoch, Richard, ''Performing Bohemia'' (2004)] (accessed March 13, 2007). See also Tom Robertson's play ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'', which fictionalised the evenings in Evans's café in one scene.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though ''Fun'' was seen as liberal in comparison with the increasingly conservative ''Punch'', it could cast satirical scorn or praise on either side of the political spectrum. For instance, [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]], whose unorthodox character and ethnic lineage made him a popular focus of attack, was praised in the magazine, including for his Reform Bill of 1867.&lt;ref name=storyboard/&gt;

Byron ceded the editorship of the paper to Hood in 1865 and sold ''Fun'' to engravers and publishers [[dalziel Brothers|George and Edward Dalziel]] in 1870, who had previously engraved drawings for ''Punch''. Two years later they transferred it to their nephew Gilbert Dalziel (1853–1930). After the death of Hood and the end of contributions from Gilbert by 1874, the quality of the content began a slow decline. During the 1870s, the circulation of ''Fun'' is estimated at 20,000, compared with ''Punch'''s 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;Ellegard, Alvar, "The Readership of the Periodical Press in Mid-Victorian Britain," in ''Victorian Periodicals Newsletter'', 3 (September, 1971), p. 20)&lt;/ref&gt; Hood was succeeded as editor by Henry Sampson until 1878, and then the editorship devolved to Charles Dalziel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/data/data127.html Publisher and editor data]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, the Dalziels withdrew from the journal.

''Fun'' ceased publication in 1901, when it was absorbed into ''Sketchy Bits''.&lt;ref&gt;Hiley, Nicholas. [http://find.galegroup.com/ukpc/topicguide/ncup_15.htm "Comic Periodicals"], ''19th Century UK Periodicals'', Detroit: [[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] (2008), accessed May 10, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!''''' is a book written by [[Robert Elliott Burns]] in 1932 and published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap. 

The book tells the story of Burns' imprisonment on a [[chain gang]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the 1920s, his subsequent escape, and the furor that developed. The story was first published in January 1932, serialized  in ''True Detective Mysteries'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-793 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang! |publisher=The New Georgia Encyclopedia|accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Burns' story was made into the motion picture ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]'', starring [[Paul Muni]]. The book and movie were both credited with helping to reform deplorable conditions on Deep South chain gangs under Governor [[Ellis Arnall]] in 1943. 

A sequel, ''Out of These Chains'', was written by Burns' brother, [[Vincent Godfrey Burns]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian priest]], in 1942.

==Plot==
Sam Sotto is a Hollywood actor who is known as "king of voice-overs" for his extensive narration and voice-over work. He has recently published an autobiography and is about to receive a lifetime achievement award upon turning 60. His 31-year-old daughter, Carol Solomon, is a struggling [[vocal coach]] who has always been overshadowed by her father. Sam forces Carol to move out of his house so that he can live with his girlfriend Jamie, who is a year younger than Carol. Carol leaves to stay with her older sister Dani and her husband Moe.

An upcoming film series, ''The Amazon Games'', plans to bring back the "In a world..." line made famous by the late [[Don LaFontaine]]. The trailer voice-over is highly sought after. Sam bows out so that his friend and heir-apparent, Gustav Warner, can assume the role, but Gustav develops [[laryngitis]] and fails to show up to a [[temp track]] recording. Carol happens to be at the studio doing other work with engineer Louis, and she substitutes for Gustav. The series' executive producer decides she wants Carol for the job instead. Carol also gets other voice-over work, but she neglects to tell her self-absorbed father about her newfound success. Gustav and Sam feel entitled and are dismissive of the unknown woman who "stole" the job from them.

Carol visits Dani at the hotel where Dani works as concierge. Intrigued by the voice of a flirtatious Irish guest, she asks Dani to interview and record him for her voice archive. During the interview, Dani pretends to be single.

Carol joins Sam and Jamie at a party at Gustav's mansion. Gustav flirts with her, and Carol ends up staying the night. While waiting for Dani to come home from work, Moe listens to the recording of her interview with the hotel guest and is shocked at her lie. He leaves the apartment after she arrives.

Rumors spread quickly about Carol and Gustav. Gustav boasts to Sam of his night with some party-crasher, and when Gustav learns she is the woman in competition for the job, he decides to keep pursuing her, still not fully realizing who she is.

Sam and Jamie host a meal for Sam's daughters. It comes out that Carol is the mystery woman in the running for the coveted job. Sam is indignant, furious at Gustav, and dismissive of Carol, causing her to leave angry. Sam vows to compete for the job himself.

Dani is distraught about her husband, and Carol secretly records her anguish, sending the message to Moe to help win him back.

Competition for the job heats up. All three must send recordings for the studio to decide among. Carol is ready to drop out, but Louis champions her cause, also explaining that he likes her. Carol admits she likes him, too. They work together to produce the audition recording, then party together afterwards. At the end of the night, Louis finally kisses her.

Though Carol is still angry at her father, Moe insists that she and Dani go to the [[Golden Trailer Awards]], where Sam is due to receive a lifetime achievement award. There the trailer for ''The Amazon Games'' is revealed; Carol got the job and is elated. Sam storms off. Jamie berates him and threatens to leave him if he does not grow up and show support for his daughters. During his acceptance speech, Sam is magnanimous in victory, dedicating the award to his daughters. In the ladies room, Carol encounters the executive producer, Katherine Huling, who bluntly tells Carol that she was not the best person for the job, but was chosen for the greater meaning of having a woman in that role.

In the final scene, Carol goes back to her work as a voice coach, helping low self-esteem, high-pitched, squeaky-voiced women to speak less like a "baby doll" or "[[sexy baby voice|sexy baby]]"&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="huff3671145" /&gt; --&gt; and be taken more seriously as mature women, using her voice-over on ''The Amazon Games'' trailer as their inspiration.

==Production==

===Background===
{{Anchor|Writing}}
The film's title was inspired by the phrase used by [[Don LaFontaine]] to start many [[Trailer (promotion)|film trailers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/2013/08/08/210135579/in-a-world-all-voice-overs-are-not-created-equal | title = In 'A World,' All Voice-Overs Are Not Created Equal | accessdate = August 8, 2013 | date = August 8, 2013 | publisher = [[NPR]] | author= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Bell, almost no notable film trailers have employed female voice-over talent except for ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]'' (2000), which used [[Melissa Disney]].&lt;ref name="huff3719882"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/07/lake-bell-in-a-world_n_3719882.html | title = Lake Bell Talks 'In A World,' Mastering Accents, Voice-Over Sexism And William Shatner's Uniqueness | accessdate = August 8, 2013 | date = August 7, 2013 | last = Jacobs | first = Matthew | work = [[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bell had been intrigued that the prototypical "omniscient" voice behind film trailers was male. This inspired her to write a story in which a female [[protagonist]] sought to overcome this prejudice,&lt;ref name="huff3671145"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/29/lake-bell-in-a-world_n_3671145.html | title = Lake Bell, 'In A World' Director, Writer And Star, Thinks There's A Vocal 'Pandemic' Among Young Women | accessdate = July 31, 2013 | date = July 29, 2013 | work = [[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in her feature-length writing, directing, and producing debut.&lt;ref name="LBoHDDIaW"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/video/lake-bell-her-directorial-debut-414160 | title = Lake Bell on Her Directorial Debut 'In a World' | accessdate = June 24, 2013 | date = January 21, 2013 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Casting}}
Bell wrote the screenplay with particular people in mind, hoping they would be interested in the project, explaining, "I was inspired to cast not only people who are great comedians but [...] who have a complex life [...] I knew that there was a profundity there that I wanted to tap into."&lt;ref name="latimes20130810" /&gt;
Bell also recruited her then boyfriend Scott Cambell as an art assistant for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/lake-bell-on-in-a-world-and-tattoos.html |work=Vulture|title=Lake Bell On ''In a World'' and Tattoos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===

====Production====
Filming took place over 20 days in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; Bell did extensive preparation work before the film, bringing lengthy notes.&lt;ref name="huff3719882" /&gt; She deliberately filmed using shots in the style of a drama, although the film is a comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Lake Bell | title = In a World... | url = http://www.landmarktheatres.com/mn/inaworld.html | work = Landmark Theatres }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "nose kiss" scene was suggested by Ken Marino, and it made Bell laugh so much she told him he would need to do it twice.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt;&lt;!-- acting / on set improv --&gt;

===Critical response===
{{Anchor|Critics|Reviews|Critical reception}}
[[File:Lake Bell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|''In a World...'' marked [[Lake Bell]]'s [[feature film]] writing, directing and producing debut.]]
Review-aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 92% based on 106 reviews.

A.O. Scott of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Bell, writing that she "plays Carol with a perfect blend of diffidence, goofiness and charm, has written and directed an insightful comedy that is much more complex and ambitious than it sometimes seems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = [[The New York Times]] | author = [[A.O.

While noting that Bell is a former contributor to the publication, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{`s}} Tod McCarthy comments that the film is "a lively, sometimes very funny comedy" that offers an "amusing peek into a seldom-visited corner of showbiz," that is the world of Hollywood voice-over talent.&lt;ref name="IaWSR"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/a-world/review/414852 | title = In a World...: Sundance Review | accessdate = July 30, 2013 | date = January 23, 2013 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | last = McCarthy | first = Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCarthy describes Sam as "genial and intimidating" and Carol as a "charming, neurotic live wire" who is also "shapely and quick-witted."&lt;ref name="IaWSR" /&gt; Carol "has great delivery herself and is wonderful with accents and dialects," according to McCarthy.&lt;ref name="IaWSR" /&gt; McCarthy notes that "all the actors pop with well-defined personalities," but that Melamed "formidably dominates" the film.&lt;ref name="IaWSR" /&gt;
British critic [[Mark Kermode]] praised the film for its "sharp and very snarky" humor, said it "has just enough bite, and stays on the right side of bitter," and reserved special praise for Melamed, whose performance he called "absolutely brilliant." He also praised Bell for avoiding the smug, self-serving insider view that other Hollywood films fall foul to, and the well observed characters, and although he does not think it will be a huge hit, says he thinks it deserves to do well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma9BWrGetK8 | title = Mark Kermode reviews In A World | work = [[BBC 5 live]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[National Public Radio]], "Underneath the comedy, it's a moving story about female empowerment," with Bell's character Carol serving as voice-over industry counterpart to [[Rocky Balboa]].&lt;ref name="IAWIACAYGIVA" /&gt;

John Anderson of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' notes the picture achieves its most important goal of making the voiceover industry something of interest to a broad audience.&lt;ref name="RIaW" /&gt; He describes it as "a rollicking laffer about the cutthroat voiceover biz in Los Angeles" and "a film with too many laugh lines to be absorbed in one sitting."&lt;ref name=RIaW&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/in-a-world-1117949047/ | title = Review: "In a World ..." | accessdate = July 30, 2013 | date = January 21, 2013 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | last = Anderson | first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson describes Bell as a "magnetic, intelligent, blithely screwball leading lady in the [[Carole Lombard]] tradition."&lt;ref name="RIaW" /&gt;

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the Archive is to document the history of [[women in architecture|women's involvement in architecture]] by acquiring, preserving, storing, and making available to researchers the professional papers of women architects, landscape architects, designers, architectural historians and critics, urban planners, and the records of women's architectural organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zellner|first=Paola|year=2016|title=El Archivo Internacional de Mujeres en Arquitectura celebra 30 años: una nueva visión|url=|journal=Bitácora Arquitectura|publisher=UNAM|volume=33|pages=16–23|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==
The IAWA collects the papers of women who practiced at a time when there were few women in the field (i.e., before the 1950s) and to fill serious gaps in the availability of primary research materials for architectural, women's, and social history research. As of October 2006 there were over {{convert|1200|cuft|m3}} of materials in the 298 collections in the IAWA, which are housed in Virginia Tech's University Libraries' Special Collections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As part of its mission to act as a clearinghouse of information about all women architects, past and present, the IAWA also collects and catalogs books, monographs and other publications written by or about women architects, designers, planners, etc. These publications are accessible through the Virginia Tech library's online catalog, Addison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://addison.vt.edu/|title=Addison: Search|website=addison.vt.edu|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAWA began with a collecting focus on the papers of pioneering women in architecture, individuals who practiced at a time when there were few women in the field. Today, the IAWA includes materials that document multiple generations of women in architecture, providing vital primary source materials for architectural, women's, and social history research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://placesjournal.org/article/unforgetting-women-architects-from-the-pritzker-to-wikipedia/|title=Unforgetting Women Architects: From the Pritzker to Wikipedia|last=Stratigakos|first=Despina|date=April 2016|website=Places|publisher=|access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collections includes material of relevant women architects as [[Jane Hastings|L. Jane Hastings]], [[Anna Keichline]], [[Yasmeen Lari]], [[Doina Marilena Ciocănea]], [[Eleanore Pettersen]], [[Sigrid Lorenzen Rupp]], [[Beverly Willis]], [[Diana Balmori]], [[Han Schröder]], [[Mary Colter]], [[Zelma Wilson]], [[Liane Zimbler]], Trudy Rosen, Pamela Webb, [[Berta Rahm]], and [[Olive Chadeayne]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The IAWA also compiles biographical information. There is information about more than 650 women representing 48 countries and 42 states/territories in the United States available in the IAWA Biographical Database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iawadb.lib.vt.edu/|title=IAWA Biographical Database|last=|first=|date=|website=International Archive of Women in Architecture|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the IAWA's resources, approximately 1200 images from 28 collections, have been scanned and are available through the VT ImageBase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://imagebase.lib.vt.edu/browse.php?folio_ID=/iawa|title=Browsing International Archive of Women in Architecture - IAWA|last=|first=|date=|website=Imagebase. Virginia Tech|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Board ==
The IAWA is overseen by a board of advisors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/IAWA/BOA.html|title=IAWA (International Archive of Women in Architecture) Board of Advisors, Virginia Tech|last=|first=|date=|website=International Archive of Women in Architecture|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; that includes architects, city planners, industrial and interior designers, librarians, archivists, and faculty from around the world and the U.S. The head of Special Collections or her designee serves as the Archivist for the IAWA and sits on the Board of Advisors and the Executive Board. She prepares a report for presentation to the annual meeting held in the fall of each year at Virginia Tech's Newman Library in the President's Board Room.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Milka Bliznakov Research Prize ==
The Milka Bliznakov Research Prize was established in 2001 to honor IAWA founder and advisor emerita, Dr. [[Milka Bliznakov]] (1927-2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sokolina|first=Anna|year=|title=In Memoriam: Milka Bliznakov, 1927-2010|url=|journal=Slavic Review|volume=70-2 (Summer 2011)|pages=498–499.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAWA Center invites architects, scholars, professionals, students, and researchers to contribute research on women in architecture and related design fields. This research, in concert with the preservation efforts of the IAWA, will help fill the current void in historical knowledge about the achievements and work of women who shaped the built environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/IAWA/Bliznakov/Bliznakov.html|title=Milka Bliznakov Research Prize|last=|first=|date=|website=International Archive of Women in Architecture|publisher=|access-date=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4918">The ''Ordinance for the Regulating of Printing'' also known as the '''Licensing Order of 1643''' instituted pre-publication [[censorship]] upon Parliamentary [[England]]. [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'' was written specifically against this Act.

==Abolition of the Star Chamber==
Parliament, by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]], abolished the [[Star Chamber]] in July 1641, which led to the de facto cessation of censorship. The loosening of controls led to an immediate rise in publishing.  Between 1640 and 1660, at least 300 news publications were produced.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}.

==The Licensing Order of 1643==
[[Image:Areopagitica 1644bw gobeirne.png|thumb|left|150px|First page of [[John Milton]]'s 1644 edition of ''[[Areopagitica]]'', in it he argued forcefully against the Licensing Order of 1643.]]
The abolition of the Star Chamber and the severe 1637 [[Star Chamber Decree]], however, did not indicate Parliament's intention to permit freedom of speech and of the press; rather it indicated a desire on the part of Parliament to replace the Royal censorship machinery with its own.

Motivated by a desire to eliminate chaos and piracy in the printing industry, protect parliamentary activities and proceedings from its opponents, suppress royalist propaganda and check the widening currency of various sects’ radical ideas, Parliament instituted a new state-controlled censoring apparatus in ''An Ordinance for the Regulating of Printing'' of 14 June 1643.&lt;ref&gt;'June 1643: An Ordinance for the Regulating of Printing.', Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660 (1911), pp. 184-86. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=55829. Date accessed: 12 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Licensing Order reintroduced almost all of the stringent censorship machinery of the 1637 Star Chamber Decree including: 
* pre-publication licensing
* registration of all printing materials with the names of author, printer and publisher in the Register at Stationers’ Hall
* search, seizure and [[book burning|destruction]] of any books offensive to the government
* arrest and imprisonment of any offensive writers, printers and publishers.

The Stationers’ Company was given the responsibility of acting as censor, in return for a monopoly of the printing trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ibas.re.kr/eng/journal/10-5.pdf|title = Areopagitica in the Licensing Controversy: Milton's Rhetorical Strategies and Modes|last = Park|first = Eunmi|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009090615/http://www.ibas.re.kr/eng/journal/10-5.pdf|archivedate = 2007-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Milton's ''Areopagitica''==
In protest, English poet and political writer, [[John Milton]] published the ''[[Areopagitica]]: A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing, to the Parlament of England'' in November, 1644 (16 months following the Licensing Order).

==Censorship during the Restoration==
After the Restoration of the monarchy in the 1660s, even tighter controls were imposed on the press.  A single individual was given the authority to publish an official newspaper along with the responsibility of serving as censor for all other publications.

==1694: the Licensing Order lapses==

With the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, William and Mary were invited to ascend the throne on the condition that they agree to the terms spelled out in the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Declaration of Rights]]. This came to be understood as part of the British "constitution" that American patriots cited as the source of their own freedoms as "Englishmen".

The Licensing Order was allowed to lapse in 1694.  Although most accounts stipulate that "the Licensing act expired in 1695", the "expiration" was not the result of a simple lapse of attention on the part of the government.  Instead, the freedoms established by the Declaration of Rights created a more open society, and an explosion of print was the result.  In England, the emergence of publications like the ''[[Tatler (1709)|Tatler]]'' and the ''[[The Spectator (1711)|Spectator]]'' are given credit for creating a 'bourgeois public sphere' that allowed for a free exchange of ideas and information.  In America, the end of the Licensing Act also sparked the creation of new publications and set the stage for the battle of words that would lead to the [[American Revolution]] in the second half of the eighteenth century.

'''Mrs. John Wood''' (6 November 1831 (bap. 28 November), [[Liverpool]] – 11 January 1915, [[Birchington-on-Sea]]), born '''Matilda Charlotte Vining''', was an [[English people|English]] [[actress]] and [[theatre manager]].

==Biography==
Born into a [[Theatre|theatrical]] family, Vining travelled the country as a [[child actor]]. Over time, she developed a talent for [[comedy]]. An older sister was [[Fanny Vining Davenport|Fanny Vining]].

In 1854, Matilda Vining married John Wood, an English actor. The couple moved to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where they became involved in [[American theatre]]. Her first part in the United States was Gertrude in ''[[A Loan of a Lover]]'' on 11 September 1854. The Woods played Boston for three seasons and for the first three months of their third, appeared at the [[Wallack's Theatre]] in [[New York City]]. New York was already the centre of American theatre, and Mrs. John Wood came to outshine her husband. [[T. Allston Brown]], a contemporary historian of the theatre &lt;!--not theatER please, she was English--&gt;, offers this explanation for her fame:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mrs. John Wood was a very pretty woman, possessing a fine figure and an attractive face. Her style was excellent in everything she attempted. She read well, had a melodious voice, was affecting in pathetic scenes and lively in those of a cheerful character, was a graceful dancer, and, although her voice was not very strong, it was melodious and well cultivated. She possessed the artistic talent which satisfied every demand that could be made by the most rigid stickler for a high degree of merit in a theatrical artist.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mr. and Mrs. John Wood again played Wallack's in the summer of 1857, then moved to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]]. There they played [[Maguire's Opera House]] on 18 January 1858. This season, Mrs. John Wood gained renown for her roles in ''[[Hi-a-wa-tha; or, Ardent Spirit and Laughing Waters]]'' and ''[[Love's Disguises]]''. She may have managed two theatres during this period: the [[Forrest Theatre]] in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] for a few weeks in 1858 and the [[American Theatre, San Francisco|American Theatre]] in San Francisco from March 1859 to the beginning of summer.

In mid-1859, Mrs. John Wood parted ways with her husband, daughter, and mother and returned to New York. There she joined [[Dion Boucicault|Dion Boucicault's]] troupe at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]].  Mrs. Wood and Boucicault clashed, so Mrs. Wood decided to tour New York independently for three seasons.

On 2 April 1861, ten days before the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], Mrs. John Wood performed&lt;ref&gt;Newcomb,  cover.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dixie (song)|Dixie]] for a concluding scene featuring a [[Zouave]] march in a production of the burlesque [[Po-ca-hon-tas, or The Gentle Savage|Po-ca-hon-tas]] in New Orleans. The song was well-received and encored seven times,&lt;ref&gt;Reinert 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; contributing to the popularity of the song as a Civil War anthem for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

Mrs. Wood met [[Laura Keene]] in the summer of 1860 while playing at Keene's playhouse, which was renamed the Olympic Theatre in 1863.
She managed [[Jane English's Theatre]] from its reopening on 8 October 1863. Soon after, she became manager of the Olympic, which changed its name to Mrs. John Wood's Olympic Theatre. She stayed there three seasons, during which she concentrated on [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]]s and [[comedy|comedies]]. On 30 June 1866, Mrs. John Wood departed for [[England]].

Mrs. Wood continued her management career at the [[St. James Theatre]] in London from 1869 until mid-1872. She then returned to the United States for the 1872-1873 season, then returned to England.  In 1881, she appeared in ''[[Foggerty's Fairy]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert]].  Until her retirement in 1893, she managed a number of English theatres.

Mrs. Wood died in 1915 at the age of 83.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29799">The '''New World Tapestry''' was for a time the largest stitched [[embroidery]] in the world,&lt;ref name="Parsons"/&gt; larger than the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]. It depicts English [[colonisation]] attempts in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], North America, the [[Guyana]]s and [[Bermuda]] between the years 1583 and 1642, when the [[English Civil War]] began.

Work began on the tapestry in 1980 and continued for twenty years. The tapestry's home was the [[British Empire &amp; Commonwealth Museum]] in the original 1840s terminal station designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] near the modern [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station]] in central [[Bristol]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="Move to Bristol"/&gt; This museum has now closed and the collections are cared for by Bristol Museums, Galleries &amp; Archives. The tapestry and the rest of the collections are in storage.

==The panels==
The New World Tapestry, which in its entirety measures {{convert|267|x|4|ft|m|abbr=on}}, consists of twenty-four panels,&lt;ref name="Move to Bristol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Visit Britain"/&gt; each of which depicts the [[narrative]] of a particular phase in the period between 1583 and 1642.

Each panel measures {{convert|11|x|4|ft|m|abbr=on}}.
{{Quotation|The figures of the [[tapestry]] are rendered in an unmistakably modern, [[cartoon]]-like style, but it also follows in the tradition of [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] [[canvas work]] embroidery. The panels are worked in [[gobelin]] stitch which entirely covers the ground, and along with pictures of the main scenes of the story, the panels also feature birds, animals, flowers and insects all beautifully worked in bold colours.|"Bristol and the New World"|[[Aztec]]s at MexicoLore &lt;ref name="MexicoLore"/&gt;}}

==The creation of the tapestry==
The designer was Tom Mor,&lt;ref name="City London anniversary"/&gt; who also designed the Plymouth Tapestry at [[Prysten House]],&lt;ref name="Frommers"/&gt;  [[Plymouth]], the Adventurers for Virginia ([[London]]) Tapestry,&lt;ref name="City London anniversary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HNN anniversary"/&gt;  and was the consultant on the [[History of Jersey#20th century|Jersey]] Liberation Tapestry ([[St Helier]], [[Channel Islands]]) and the Plympton Tapestry ([[Plympton]], Devon). The panel was researched by Tom Mor, Tom Maddock, Paul Presswell and Freda Simpson. Chief tapissiers were Joan Roncarelli and Renée Harvey. A New World Tapestry Website has been developed as of December 2008 and will soon include 120 pages, showing all complete panels.&lt;ref name="OfficialWebsite"/&gt;

Research for the New World Tapestry's twenty-four panels began in 1980. Tom Mor was joined by Tom Maddock, a retired friend from [[Ivybridge]]. Over the months they travelled hundreds of miles together, researching the two hundred sixty four people who would be named on the tapestry.  [[Heraldry|Heraldic]] expert Paul Presswell of [[Buckfastleigh]] identified all the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of the people, colleges and companies involved. The result has been the creation alongside the tapestry of a [[library]] of files on each person and a collection of [[Reference work|reference books]] of great use to [[research]]ers, [[Academia|scholars]] and [[teacher]]s.&lt;ref name="City London anniversary"/&gt;

Two hundred sixty four [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|armorial shields]] run along the top and bottom tapestry borders throughout its length, alternating with illustrations of the same number of flowers of herbs, [[Herbalism|medicinal plants]], trees and shrubs. The latter are shown because the colonists took ointments and cure-alls with them on their voyages and plant hunters returned with such things as the [[potato]] and [[tobacco]].

All the flowers and florets depicted were drawn from nature by Tom Mor, who studied them under a [[watchmaker]]'s glass. He was helped from the very early days by Freda Simpson of Plymouth, who was passionately interested in herbs and old herbal remedies. She identified and gave him over 230 flower [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s in the years that Mor lived with his wife and family in [[Plymouth]]. Later they moved to [[Cambridge]] where he was able to complete the set of 264 drawings with the help of Clive King and Caroline Lawes of the [[Cambridge University Botanic Garden]], Lady Jane Renfrew of [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish College]] and Alison Davies, Monica Stokes and Edna Norman.

===The stitchers===
Tom Mor could not have seen his canvasses brought to life without the help of his friends and the expertise of the dedicated tapissiers. When the very first stitch was made in the New World Tapestry in 1980, the team working in Prysten House numbered twenty. By the time the last stitch was made in March 2000, the number of tapissiers had increased to two hundred fifty-six with the addition of another eight centres. In [[Devon]] there was a second in Plymouth at [[HMNB Devonport|HMS ''Drake'']] (the [[Royal Navy]]'s panel), [[Ivybridge]], [[Chillington, Devon|Chillington]], [[Exeter]], [[Bideford]], [[Totnes]] and [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]] Castle.  [[Dorset]]'s Tapestry centre was in the [[Guildhall, Lyme Regis|Guildhall]] at [[Lyme Regis]] and it was there that the Great Gardeners and Herbalists panel was stitched.

The first [[Gobelin stitch|oblique Gobelin stitch]] was made on 26 September 1980 in Prysten House&lt;ref name="Frommers"/&gt;  in Plymouth, by U.S. Ambassador the Hon. [[Kingman Brewster]]. The coat of arms of His Excellency's ancestor, [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrim]] leader [[William Brewster (pilgrim)|William Brewster]], appears on the 1620 ''[[Mayflower]]'' Panel.

The last oblique Gobelin stitch was made by HRH [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]]&lt;ref name="City London anniversary"/&gt; on 3 March 2000 in the Orchard Room of his home at [[Highgrove House]] in [[Gloucestershire]]. Most fittingly, with his interest in history and a keen gardener himself, the Prince put his golden wool stitch in the date of the 1642 Great Gardeners and Herbalists' Panel.

Stitches have also been added by HM [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]], HM [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], HRH [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]], HRH [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]] and HRH [[Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester|The Duchess of Gloucester]].

==Racism controversy==
In 2017, representatives of the [[National Congress of American Indians]], who had previously been unaware of the tapestry project, issued statements to the effect that the final product was racist in its depiction of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/20/history-tapestry-stitches-queen-prince-charles-condemned-racist/ |title= History tapestry with stitches by Queen and Prince Charles condemned as 'racist' |author= Hannah Furness |date= 20 September 2017 |work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate= 19 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   "It shamelessly perpetuates a centuries-long artistic tradition that seeks to portray Native people as subhuman, warlike savages,” according to Jacqueline Pata, the executive director of National Congress of American Indians.&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/09/20/racist-tapestry-completed-by-prince-charles-denounced-by-native-americans.html |title= 'Racist' tapestry completed by Prince Charles denounced by Native Americans |author= Staff |date= 20 September 2017 |work= [[Fox News]] |accessdate= 19 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"What I wanted to avoid was the picture of English people coming ashore from their galleon to the New World as peaceful and quiet. It wasn’t so," Mor told The Telegraph. "It's no use pretending about it or being shocked by it. Mine is a cartoon, but it is a reality. I tell it as it is and I tell it with humour."&lt;ref name="Staff"/&gt;

==The Library==
The New World Tapestry Library&lt;ref name="City London anniversary"/&gt; material includes histories of the years 1583-1642, much of it original research, files on the two hundred sixty four people named on the tapestry, plus [[heraldry|heraldic]] information on over three hundred individuals, companies, towns, counties and universities.

==Supporters==
Supporters of the New World Tapestry include the Adventurers for Virginia&lt;ref name="Casing"/&gt; patrons of the New World Tapestry and Library. Their names are inscribed for posterity in the Adventurers for Virginia Record Book. Supporters who join the Adventurers for Virginia may also:

* In London, celebrate the Adventurers for Virginia Day every 10 April to commemorate the granting of [[royal charter]]s by [[James II of England]] to the [[London Company]] and the Plymouth Adventurers ([[Plymouth Company]]) in 1606 to establish colonies in Virginia
* Help fund the production of the book, ''The [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], [[Kennebec River|Sagadahoc]] and [[Bermuda]] Story'', for schools and researchers.
* Help fund the production of the [[George Yeardley|Yeardley]]/[[James River plantations|Flowerdew]] [[Brasses]]&lt;ref name="Flowerdew brasses"/&gt;  for presentation in England and America.
* Help make grants to the [[British Empire &amp; Commonwealth Museum]] at [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station]] in [[Bristol]] to create the permanent exhibition of the New World Tapestry, expand and enhance the New World Tapestry Library and help the development of three-way educational research between [[England]], the [[Americas]] and [[Bermuda]].
* Receive a tie showing the Adventurers' badge plus a lifetime pass to view the tapestry at the museum in Bristol.

'''''Ninety from the Nineties: A Decade of Printing''''' was an exhibition held at the [[New York Public Library]] from November 7, 2003 through May 28, 2004.

''Ninety from the Nineties'' showcased a selection of ninety books made in the 1990s that were chosen on the merit of book arts. Note that the books were not necessarily written in the 1990s; some were older texts that were used to make special books in the 1990s. And, the books were not selected on literary merit.

In a contemporary review, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the concept of the selection like this: "books, which we are accustomed to thinking of as containers — and conveyers — of information, are placed in a context in which form is valued over content. Language is less important than the type that impresses it on the page. The paper counts for more than the story told on it. The illustrations and the binding might be the story."

The books were divided into five categories: [[Bookbinding|binding]], paper, [[typography|type]], [[illustration]] and "inspiration." The exhibition was curated by Virginia Bartow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2989">The '''Oslo Conservatory of Music''' ({{lang-no|Musikkonservatoriet i Oslo}}) was a music school in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].

The school was established by [[Ludvig Mathias Lindeman]] and his son [[Peter Brynie Lindeman]] in 1883 in Christiania (as Oslo was then called) and was named the Organist School ({{lang-no|Organistskolen}}).&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. 1961. ''Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', vol. 9. Kassel: Bärenreiter, p. 1583.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885 it had 174 students and was renamed the Music and Organist School. Peter Brynie Lindeman took over leadership of the school after his father's death in 1887. The school was renamed again in 1892 to the Christiania Music Conservatory, and it was the only institution of its kind in Norway until 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nmh.no/om_musikkhogskolen/musikkhogskolens_historie Norges musikkhøgskole: Musikkhøgskolens historie.]&lt;/ref&gt; Peter's son [[Trygve Lindeman]] (1896–1979), who studied music in Stockholm, became a teacher at the school in 1921 and became its head in 1930. Trygve Lindeman retired in the 1960s and management was transferred to the Lindeman Foundation ({{lang-no|Lindemans Legat}}).&lt;ref&gt;[https://nbl.snl.no/Trygve_Lindeman ''Norsk biografisk leksikon'': Trygve Lindeman.]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1969 to 1973, the conservatory was operated in a partnership between the foundation and the government. The school offered a mix of professional training of musicians, and amateur education for children and adults. The conservatory closed in 1973, when the [[Norwegian Academy of Music]] was established.

The Conservatory of Music Archives were administered by the Lindeman Foundation until 2013, when they were transferred to the [[National Archives of Norway]]. The archives consist of teaching records with student and teacher schedules, evening performances by students, the music conservatory society, and a series of leaving assessments of students. It also contains some accounting records, including student payments and salary records. The materials cover the period from the school's establishment in 1883 until it started being shut down in 1969/70.

*[[Geir Henning Braaten]] (born 1944), pianist

Part of the collection of the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels (AAM 68.14,21,22,24).]]

'''Pretty Ladies''' is the name archaeologists gave to pre-Columbian female figurines in Mexico, from the Chupicuaro, Michoacan, and Tlattlco&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Female Figure, The MET Museum Collection Catalogue, http://metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/313186&lt;/ref&gt; cultures at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;María Elena Bernal-García, “Reclaiming Tlatlico’s Figurines From Biased Analysis”, in ''Woman And Art in Early Modern Latin America'', Kellen Kee MacIntyre, Richard E. Phillips (eds.), 1996, p.155-156&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological research and context ==
The figurines were found in archaeological research at the beginning of the 1930s by Mexican and American archaeologists. It is in fact the discovery of the figurines that led to the discovery of whole sites, like the Tlatlico one.

There are many interpretations of what were the function of the figures. In some configurations, they were buried with dead bodies to ensure the resurrection of the corpses.&lt;ref&gt;María Elena Bernal-García, “Reclaiming Tlatlico’s Figurines From Biased Analysis”, in ''Woman And Art in Early Modern Latin America'', Kellen Kee MacIntyre, Richard E. Phillips (eds.), 1996, p.177&lt;/ref&gt; They also represented fertility, not necessarily human fertility but also earth fertility.&lt;ref&gt;María Elena Bernal-García, “Reclaiming Tlatlico’s Figurines From Biased Analysis”, in ''Woman And Art in Early Modern Latin America'', Kellen Kee MacIntyre, Richard E. Phillips (eds.), 1996, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descriptions ==

These figurines were described in different ways, highlighting different aspects:
*“females with large heads, small waists, and prominent hips”.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*“naked female with short arms, extended stomach and a fancy coiffure or headdress”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londoncoin.com/item/terracotta-chupicuaro-pretty-lady-figure/|title=Terracotta Chupicuaro "Pretty Lady" Figure|date=3 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming problematics ==

These figures are also called by archaeologists “naked feminine figures”, “nude girls”, “topless girls and women” or even “Venus of (Tlatlico, for instance)“,&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;María Elena Bernal-García, “Reclaiming Tlatlico’s Figurines From Biased Analysis”, in ''Woman And Art in Early Modern Latin America'', Kellen Kee MacIntyre, Richard E. Phillips (eds.), 1996, p.154&lt;/ref&gt; which is problematic because in doing so, they projected ideals on the culture these figures were part of, influenced by European representations of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;María Elena Bernal-García, “Reclaiming Tlatlico’s Figurines From Biased Analysis”, in ''Woman And Art in Early Modern Latin America'', Kellen Kee MacIntyre, Richard E. Phillips (eds.), 1996, p.159&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the naming of clay figures was done in a different way for female and male representations. The equivalent male figures were never called “pretty lords” or “nude men”, even when they were as naked as the female figures, but rather “man”, “male figure”, “chief”, etc.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== History ==

Protagonize is an [[online community]] and [[self-publishing]] platform, launched in December, 2007 by creator Nick Bouton &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/person/nick-bouton|title=Nick Bouton on Crunch Base|publisher=Crunch base |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a home for [[Choose Your Own Adventure]]-style branching stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kyllo|first=Blaine|title=Web community spins Protagonize's yarns|url=https://www.straight.com/life/web-community-spins-protagonizes-yarns|newspaper=straight.com|date=Jul 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Riley|first=Duncan|title=Protagonize Is A Good Read, Help Write "FriendFeed Fan"|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/572/protagonize-is-a-good-read-help-write-friendfeed-fan/|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=THE INQUISITR|date=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after launch, the site began to allow for linear narrative as well, and has since expanded to include poetry, screenplays, and other forms of literature.

Following its subsequent growth, there has been an increasing focus on the community aspect of the site, with features such as groups and writing circles being added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plus |url=http://www.protagonize.com/help/about |title=About Protagonize on Protagonize, a creative writing community |publisher=Protagonize.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008 Protagonize was selected as a finalist in the 2008 Canadian New Media Awards for "Excellence in Social Media Websites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Admin|title=Excellence in Social Media Websites|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/winners-at-the-canadian-new-media-awards-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009 Protagonize was one of seven local BC startups chosen to demo at Launch Party Vancouver 7 as part of the Startup Most Likely to Succeed competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Admin|title=Launch Part Vancouver 7 Companies Announced|url=http://blog.bootuplabs.com/2009/05/12/launch-party-vancouver-7-companies-announced/|publisher=Bootup Labs Blog|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Rob|title=Seven for LPV7 announced|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/seven-for-lpv7-announced|publisher=TECHVIBES|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one published book started out life as a story on Protagonize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heighway|first=Tricia|title=Paddytum|year=2010|publisher=Hirst Publishing|isbn=978-0956641731|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Paddytum-Tricia-Heighway/dp/0956641733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boog|first=Jason|title=Tricia Heighway: Digital Writer Spotlight|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/appnewser/tricia-heighway-digital-writer-spotlight_b1101|publisher=APP NEWSER|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2017, Protagonize closed down due to stagnant user growth and declining revenue from advertising and donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bouton|first=Nick|title=The End of the Road|url=http://blog.protagonize.com/2017/05/04/the-end-of-the-road/|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Reactionary modernism'''" is a term first coined by [[Jeffrey Herf]] in his 1984 book, ''Reactionary Modernism: Technology, Culture and Politics in Weimar and the Third Reich'', to describe the mixture of "great enthusiasm for modern [[technology]] with a rejection of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the values and institutions of [[liberal democracy]]" which was characteristic of the German [[Conservative Revolutionary movement]] and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name=Herf&gt;[https://www.the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=651 The Totalitarian Present: Why the West Consistently Underplays the Power of Bad Ideas, Jeffrey Herf, The American Interest]&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, this ideology of reactionary [[modernism]] was closely linked to the original, positive view of the ''[[Sonderweg]]'', which saw Germany as the great Central European power neither of the West nor of the East.

Herf's application of the term to describe [[fascism]] has been widely echoed by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Neocleous, ''Fascism'', University of Minnesota Press, 1997, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Herf had used the term to denote a trend in intellectual thought during the era, what German novelist [[Thomas Mann]] had described as "a highly technological romanticism" during the interwar years. Herf used the term in reference to a wide range of German cultural figures, including [[Ernst Jünger]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Carl Schmitt]], and [[Hans Freyer]].

==Reception of the concept==
Historian Nicolas Guilhot has broadened the scope of reactionary modernism, applying the term to trends in [[Weimar Republic]] industry, medicine ([[eugenics]]), mass politics, and social engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guilhot|first=Nicolas|title=The Invention of International Relations Theory: Realism, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the 1954 Conference on Theory|year=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231152679|pages=213–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactionary modernism can be seen in the fascist concept of the [[New Man (utopian concept)|New Man]], as well as in art movements of [[Weimar culture]] that emphasized rationalism and embraced [[Futurism]] and the [[New Objectivity]]. Many Weimar period artists rejected the Futurists' [[fetishization]] of machinery and violence, for example the proponents of [[German Expressionism]]. Despite this, the [[return to order]] became a dominant theme in German culture and in that of other European countries.

Reactionary modernism has been explored as a theme in the interwar literature and broader political culture of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zox-Weaver|first=Annalisa|title=Women Modernists and Fascism|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107008526|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been examined in the context of other European countries during the interwar period, including Romania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cotoi|first=Calin|title=Nationalisms Today|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783039118830|pages=125|editor=Tomasz Kamusella, Krzysztof Jaskułowski|chapter=Reactionary Modernism in Interwar Romania: Anton Golopentia and the Geopoliticization of Sociology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bien|first=Peter|title=Greek Modernism and Beyond: Essays in Honor of Peter Bien|year=1997|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847685776|pages=96–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pietikäinen|first=Petteri|title=Neurosis and Modernity: The Age of Nervousness in Sweden|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004160750|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Jensen, Irrational Triumph: Cultural Despair, Military Nationalism, and the Ideological Origins of Franco's Spain (Reno: University of Nevada Press, 2001), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It has even been examined in the context of fascism in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tansman|first=Alan|title=The Culture of Japanese Fascism|year=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822344681|pages=336–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians acknowledge the term's recognition of an influential trend in European philosophical, cultural and political thought during the period when fascism was on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Critchley|first=Simon|title=Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780192853592|pages=N.p.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the neologism was created by Herf, it has gained mainstream currency with historians in discussing the paradoxical European enthusiasm for paternalistic authoritarianism and [[volkish]] nationalism on the one hand, and new technological and political concepts on the other hand, all under [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Dyke|first=James A.|title=Franz Radziwill and the Contradictions of German Art History, 1919-45|year=2010|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472116287|pages=1|chapter=Introduction: Reactionary Modernism and the Problem of Nazi Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herf now applies the term to claim similarity to the governments of [[Iran]] under the Ayatollahs, the government of [[Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]], and extremist [[Islamist]] groups such as [[Al Qaeda]].&lt;ref name=Herf/&gt; Other scholars, including [[Paul Berman]], have also applied Herf's term to radical  Islamism.&lt;ref&gt;Power and the idealists, or, The passion of Joschka Fischer and its aftermath, Paul Berman, Soft Skull Press, 2005, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fascism, Mark Neocleous, University of Minnesota Press, 1997, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New World Empire: Civil Islam, Terrorism, and the Making of Neoglobalism, William H. Thornton, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radical Islam: Medieval Theology and Modern Politics, Emmanuel Sivan, Yale University Press, 1990, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural critic [[Richard Barbrook]] argues that members of the [[digerati]], who adhere to the [[Californian Ideology]], embrace a form of reactionary modernism which combines [[economic growth]] with [[social stratification]].&lt;ref name="Barbrook 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = [[Richard Barbrook|Barbrook, Richard]] | title = Cyber-Communism: How The Americans Are Superseding Capitalism In Cyberspace | year = 1999 | url = http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/17/cyber-communism-how-the-americans-are-superseding-capitalism-in-cyberspace/ | accessdate = 2010-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Rohkrämer criticized the concept of reactionary modernism, arguing "It is simply not strange or 'paradoxical to reject the Enlightenment and embrace technology at the same time', but a common practice in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Germany as well as in many other countries. Instrumental reason and technology are available for an endless number of different purposes, many of which are not humane or enlightened".&lt;ref&gt;Rohkämer, Thomas, [http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/21039/1/download.pdf  "Antimodernism, Reactionary Modernism and National Socialism. Technocratic Tendencies in Germany, 1890-1945"], accessed 28/12/2016, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Support for this view also came from Roger Griffin, who argued "[F]ascism as an ''ideology'' and ''movement'' can be seen as proposing a radical alternative to liberal and socialist visions of what form modernity ideally should take. It represents an uncompromising rejection both of thorough-going liberalism and extreme 'modernism', whose logical culmination it sees as relativism, anomie, subjectivism, and the loss of definitive meaning and 'eternal' values. It is an attempt to re-anchor modern human beings within that highly modern phenomenon, the totalitarian state (a term used positively by Fascism) through consciously manipulated historical, national and racist myth (all deeply modern ideological constructs)".&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Griffin|Griffin, Roger]], [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.194.6474&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "Modernity under the New Order: The Fascist Project for Managing the Future"], published by Thamesman Publications, Oxford Brookes School of Business imprint, 1994, accessed 28/12/2016, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Reflections on Violence''''' ({{lang-fr|Réflexions sur la violence|links=no}}), published in 1908, is a book by the French revolutionary [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] [[Georges Sorel]] on [[Class conflict|class struggle]] and [[revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Marvin|last1=Perry|first2=Matthew|last2=Berg|first3=James|last3=Krukones|title=Sources of Twentieth-Century Europe|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=2000|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorel is known for his theory that political revolution depends on the [[proletariat]] organizing violent [[uprising]]s and [[general strike|strikes]] to institute [[syndicalism]],&lt;ref name=Jennings&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Jeremy|editor-last=Jennings|chapter=Reflections on violence|first=Georges|last=Sorel|title=Cambridge Texts of the History of Political Thought|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|pages=ix−xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[economic system]] in which ''{{lang|fr|[[syndicate|syndicats]]}}'' (self-organizing groups of only proletarians) truly represent the needs of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jennings|first1=Jeremy|title=Revolution and the Republic: A History of Political Thought in France Since the Eighteenth Century|date=2011|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780198203131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5_tdrlGPOQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA420#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Sorel's most controversial claims was that violence could save the world from "[[barbarian|barbarism]]".&lt;ref name=Jennings/&gt; He equated violence with life, creativity, and virtue.&lt;ref name=Jennings/&gt;

In this book, he contends that [[myth]]s are important as "expressions of will to act".&lt;ref name=Jennings/&gt; He also supports the creation of an economic system run by and for the interests of [[Production (economics)|producers]] rather than [[Consumption (economics)|consumers]].&lt;ref name=Jennings/&gt; His ideas were influenced by various other philosophical writers, including [[Giambattista Vico]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Ernest Renan]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Eduard von Hartmann]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[John Henry Newman]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name=Jennings/&gt;

[[File:Tríptico de Santa Columba, Roger van der Weyden.jpg|thumb|600px|[[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''St Columba Altarpiece''. Oil on oak panel,  138 x 70 cm, 138 x 153 cm, 138 x 70. [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich]]

The '''''Saint Columba Altarpiece'''''  (sometimes '''''Adoration of the Kings''''') is a large c. 1455 oil-on-oak wood [[panel painting|panel]]  [[altarpiece]] by [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Rogier van der Weyden]], now in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich.&lt;ref name = "Campbell"&gt;Campbell (1980), 74&lt;/ref&gt; 

The three panels depict a narrative in which [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] is visited by the [[Annunciation|archangel Gabriel]]; she [[Nativity of Jesus|gives birth in a stable]], and she [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|presents the infant at the temple]]. The left wing shows the [[Annunciation]], the center depicts the [[Adoration of the Magi]] after [[Jesus|Christ]]'s birth, and the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Presentation in the Temple]] appears on the right wing.&lt;ref name = "Campbell"/&gt;

==Panels==

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden 008.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Annunication panel]]
The elegant Annunciation is filled with iconography, such as the faux carving of the [[fall of man]] on the side of the [[prie-dieu]] at which Mary kneels in her devotions. An old-fashioned cross hangs over her head in the center panel's Nativity scene; the donor is placed on the far left, and a sweeping landscape can be seen in the background.&lt;ref name = "Campbell"/&gt; The center panel's far right contains the exterior of the same building shown in the next scene from the inside, juxtaposing the stable with the temple and thereby causing an innovative yet jarring spatial and temporal juxtaposition. The stable is in [[Bethlehem]], the Temple in [[Jerusalem]], yet here they co-exist and function to bridge a gap from the [[Old Testament|Old]] to the [[New Testament]]. It the first Early Netherlandish painting where the building's exterior exists on one panel and its interior on the adjacent panel. Van der Weyden achieved an extremely innovative means of moving a narrative in a continuous fashion in this altarpiece. The Presentation occurs in the octagonal building's [[narthex]], surrounded by monumental arches,  another bold and innovative use of space and perspective.&lt;ref name = "Borchert87" /&gt;

The exterior panels on the reverse are covered with plain paint without evidence that they ever contained a [[donor portrait]]. The donor is positioned on the far left of the center panel.&lt;ref name = "Campbell"/&gt;

''Saint Columba altarpiece'' was the object of frequent copying in the 15th and 16th centuries,&lt;ref name = "Campbell"/&gt; and inspired some of [[Hans Memling]]'s works, among them the ''[[Triptych of Jan Floreins]]''.&lt;ref name = "Borchert87"&gt;Borchert, 87&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Commission==

The altarpiece was included as part of the 1801 inventory of [[Cologne]]'s Saint Columba cathedral, where it resided in the von dem Wasservass family chapel, which was probably established in the 1460s by Goddert von dem Wasservass, burgomaster of Cologne. It is reasonable to assume such a prominent resident of the city commissioned the piece. According to [[Lorne Campbell (Art historian)|Lorne Campbell]], based on the number of known copies, the piece probably never left the private chapel until 1801.  [[Sulpiz Boisserée|Sulpiz]] and [[Melchior Boisserée|Melchior]] Boisseree bought it in 1808; their collection was acquired in 1827 for the [[Alte Pinakothek]] in Munich.&lt;ref name = "Campbell"/&gt;

A '''''sgabello''''' is a type of [[Stool (seat)|stool]] typical of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. An [[chair|armchair]] with [[Armrest|armrests]] usually was a [[chair]] (''sedia'') of [[hieratic]] significance. ''Sgabelli'' was typically made of [[walnut]] and included a variety of carvings and turned elements. The legs could be either two decorated boards with a stretcher for support, or three separate ornamented and carved impost legs. This seat was often placed in hallways, carved with a family's ''imprese'' or emblem drawn from its [[Coat of arms|coat-of-arms]]. Its primary purpose was decorative, therefore the seat was not necessarily comfortable.[[File:French - "Sgabello"-Type Chair with Scrolls - Walters 6525 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A 16th-century French walnut ''sgabello'' ([[Walters Art Museum]])]]
Similar chairs were made in France, where they were known as a side chair. These had solid supports called rhombus seat supports. They were not used as stools.

'''SwoopThat.com''' was an online [[textbook]] [[price comparison service]]. It was based in [[San Diego]], [[California]], it specialized in [[college]] textbooks but includes [[high school]] textbooks as well. The company's [[books by course]] [[search engine]] lets students input their class schedules, see all the required textbooks for those schedules, and find the cheapest online sources of those books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Komando | first = Kim | title = Save money on textbooks. | publisher = The Kim Komando Show | url = http://www.komando.com/coolsites/index.aspx?id=10044 | date = 2011-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The search engine also includes a [[textbook exchange]] feature through which students can buy and sell books from other students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bernard | first = Tara Siegel | title = The Bucks Guide to Finding Cheap Textbooks: 3rd Edition. | publisher = The New York Times | url = http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/the-bucks-guide-to-finding-cheap-textbooks-3rd-edition/ | date = 2011-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The website also includes a textbook buyback platform through which students can sell their textbooks back to online vendors.

==History and business model==
SwoopThat was founded by students from [[Claremont McKenna College]] and [[Harvey Mudd College]]. It originally existed as a product search engine with an emphasis on local products and stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Fitzpatrick | first = Jason | title = SwoopThat Compares Online and Local Merchant Prices. | publisher = lifehacker.com | url = http://lifehacker.com/#!5670682/swoopthat-compares-local-and-online-merchant-prices/ | date = 2010-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It later shifted to a focus on [[textbooks]] based on a [[books by course]] model. It has since added course and textbook data from over 2,300 colleges in the United States.  Through SwoopThat, students can compare prices for new books, [[used books]], rental books, and [[ebooks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Podplesky | first = Azaria | title = SwoopThat: Website saves average student 50 percent on textbook costs. | publisher = The Easterner | url = http://www.easterneronline.com/news/swoopthat-website-saves-average-student-50-percent-on-textbook-costs-1.2144290/ | date = 2011-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Laird | first = Brittany | title = New site seeks to help students. | publisher = The Liberty Champion | url = http://www.libertychampion.com/2011/04/12/new-site-seeks-to-help-students/#high_2/ | date = 2011-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Ramanujam | first = Akshaya | title = Bookstore rental program continues successfully. | publisher = The California Aggie | url = http://theaggie.org/article/2011/04/12/bookstore-rental-program-continues-successfully }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Miller | first = Dan | title = "Back to School"= More Shopping Mashups. | publisher = OpusResearch | url = http://opusresearch.net/wordpress/2010/09/07/back-to-school-more-shopping-mashups// | date = 2010-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Performing arts}}

'''Theatre''' or '''theater'''&lt;ref&gt;Originally spelled ''theatre'' and ''teatre''. From around 1550 to 1700 or later, the most common spelling was ''theater''. Between 1720 and 1750, ''theater'' was dropped in [[British English]], but was either retained or revived in [[American English]] (''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd edition, 2009, CD-ROM: {{ISBN|978-0199563838}}). Recent dictionaries of American English list ''theatre'' as a less common variant, e.g., ''Random House Webster's College Dictionary'' (1991); ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', 4th edition (2006); ''New Oxford American Dictionary'', third edition (2010); [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theater ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'' (2011)].&lt;/ref&gt; is a collaborative form of [[fine art]] that uses live performers, typically [[actor|actors or actresses]], to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and [[stagecraft]] such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marvin Carlson|M. Carlson]], [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/jdtc/article/view/1642/1606 "Psychic  Polyphony"], pp. 35–47 in ''Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism'', Fall 1986, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The specific place of the performance is also named by the word "theatre" as derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] θέατρον (théatron, "a place for viewing"), itself from θεάομαι (theáomai, "to see", "to watch", "to observe").

Modern Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, [[stock character]]s, and plot elements. Theatre artist [[Patrice Pavis]] defines theatricality, [[Theatre language|theatrical language]], stage writing and the [[Medium specificity|specificity]] of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other [[performing arts]], [[literature]] and [[the arts]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavis|1998|pp=345–346}}. Drawing on the "[[semiotic]]s" of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], Pavis goes on to suggest that "the specificity of theatrical signs may lie in their ability to use [[Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce#II. Icon, index, symbol|the three possible functions of signs]]: as [[Iconicity|icon]] ([[Mimesis|mimetically]]), as [[Indexicality|index]] (in the situation of [[enunciation]]), or as symbol (as a [[Semiotics|semiological system]] in the fictional mode). In effect, theatre makes the sources of the words visual and concrete: it indicates {{em|and}} incarnates a fictional world by means of signs, such that by the end of the process of signification and symbolization the spectator has reconstructed a theoretical and aesthetic model that accounts for the dramatic universe."&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern theatre includes performances of [[play (theatre)|plays]] and [[musical theatre]]. The art forms of [[ballet]] and [[opera]] are also theatre and use many conventions such as acting, costumes and staging. They were influential to the development of musical theatre; see those articles for more information.

[[File:Phlyax scene Louvre CA7249.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A depiction of actors playing the roles of a master (right) and his slave (left) in a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[phlyax play]], circa 350/340 BCE]]
The [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] is where western theatre originated.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54). Brown writes that [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek drama]] "was essentially the creation of [[classical Athens]]: all the dramatists who were later regarded as classics were active at Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE (the time of the [[Athenian democracy]]), and all the surviving plays date from this period" (1998, 441). "The dominant culture of [[Classical Athens|Athens in the fifth century]]", Goldhill writes, "can be said to have invented theatre" (1997, 54).&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of a broader [[culture]] of theatricality and performance in [[classical Greece]] that included [[Athenian festivals|festivals]], [[Religion in ancient Greece|religious rituals]], [[Ancient Greece#Political structure|politics]], [[Ancient Greek law|law]], athletics and gymnastics, [[Music of ancient Greece|music]], [[Ancient Greek literature#Classical and Pre-Classical Antiquity|poetry]], weddings, funerals, and ''[[Symposium|symposia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge (1997, 3, 6), Goldhill (1997, 54) and (1999, 20–xx), and Rehm (1992. 3). Goldhill argues that although activities that form "an integral part of the exercise of citizenship" (such as when "the Athenian citizen speaks in the Assembly, exercises in the gymnasium, sings at the symposium, or courts a boy") each have their "own regime of display and regulation," nevertheless the term "performance" provides "a useful heuristic category to explore the connections and overlaps between these different areas of activity" (1999, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Participation in the city-state's many festivals—and mandatory attendance at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] as an audience member (or even as a participant in the theatrical productions) in particular—was an important part of [[citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelling (2005, 83).&lt;/ref&gt; Civic participation also involved the evaluation of the [[rhetoric]] of [[orators]] evidenced in performances in the [[Athenian law court (classical period)|law-court]] or [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|political assembly]], both of which were understood as analogous to the theatre and increasingly came to absorb its dramatic vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhill (1999, 25) and Pelling (2005, 83–84).&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks also developed the concepts of [[dramatic criticism]] and theatre architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Dukore (1974, 31), Janko (1987, ix), and Ward (1945, 1).&lt;!-- These citations only support "criticism" - need others for professional actors and architecture --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Actors were either amateur or at best semi-professional.&lt;ref&gt;novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/spd130et/ancientgreek.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[theatre of ancient Greece]] consisted of three types of [[drama]]: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–19).&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of theatre in ancient Greece, according to Aristotle (384–322 BCE), the first theoretician of theatre, are to be found in the festivals that honoured Dionysus. The performances were given in semi-circular auditoria cut into hillsides, capable of seating 10,000–20,000 people. The stage consisted of a dancing floor (orchestra), dressing room and scene-building area (skene). Since the words were the most important part, good acoustics and clear delivery were paramount. The actors (always men) wore masks appropriate to the characters they represented, and each might play several parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/chambdictwh/theatre|title=Credo Reference Library Login Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athenian tragedy—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of [[dance]]-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54), Ley (2007, 206), and Styan (2000, 140). Taxidou notes that "most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct" (2004, 104).&lt;/ref&gt; Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 32–33), Brown (1998, 444), and Cartledge (1997, 3–5). Cartledge writes that although [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] of the 4th century judged [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]] "as the nonpareils of the [[genre]], and regularly honoured their plays with revivals, tragedy itself was not merely a 5th-century phenomenon, the product of a short-lived [[Fifth-century Athens|golden age]]. If not attaining the quality and stature of the fifth-century 'classics', original tragedies nonetheless continued to be written and produced and competed with in large numbers throughout the remaining life of the [[Athenian democracy|democracy]]—and beyond it" (1997, 33).&lt;/ref&gt;

No tragedies from the 6th century BCE and only 32 of the more than a thousand that were performed in during the 5th century BCE have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15) and Kovacs (2005, 379). We have seven by Aeschylus, seven by Sophocles, and eighteen by Euripides. In addition, we also have the ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'', a satyr play by Euripides. Some critics since the 17th century have argued that one of the tragedies that the classical tradition gives as Euripides'—''[[Rhesus (play)|Rhesus]]''—is a 4th-century play by an unknown author; modern scholarship agrees with the classical authorities and ascribes the play to Euripides; see Walton (1997, viii, xix). (This uncertainty accounts for Brockett and Hildy's figure of 31 tragedies.)&lt;/ref&gt; We have complete texts [[Extant literature|extant]] by [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15). The theory that ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' was not written by [[Aeschylus]] adds a fourth, anonymous playwright to those whose work survives.&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of tragedy remain obscure, though by the 5th century BCE it was [[institution]]alised in competitions (''[[agon]]'') held as part of festivities celebrating [[Dionysus]] (the [[Family tree of the Greek gods|god]] of [[wine]] and [[fertility]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13–15) and Brown (1998, 441–447).&lt;/ref&gt; As contestants in the City Dionysia's competition (the most prestigious of the festivals to stage drama) playwrights were required to present a [[tetralogy]] of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 442) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–17).

Exceptions to this pattern were made, as with [[Euripides]]' ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'' in 438 BCE. There were also separate competitions at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] for the performance of [[dithyramb]]s and, after 488–7 BCE, [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedies]].&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of tragedies at the City Dionysia may have begun as early as 534 BCE; official records (''didaskaliai'') begin from 501 BCE, when the satyr play was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13, 15) and Brown (1998, 442). Rehm offers the following argument as evidence that tragedy was not institutionalised until 501 BCE: "The specific cult honoured at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] was that of Dionysus Eleuthereus, the god 'having to do with [[Eleutherae]]', a town on the border between [[Boeotia]] and [[Attica]] that had a sanctuary to Dionysus. At some point [[Classical Athens|Athens]] annexed Eleutherae—most likely after the overthrow of the [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratid]] tyranny in 510 and the democratic reforms of [[Cleisthenes]] in 508–07 BCE—and the cult-image of Dionysus Eleuthereus was moved to its new home. Athenians re-enacted the incorporation of the god's cult every year in a preliminary rite to the City Dionysia. On the day before the festival proper, the cult-statue was removed from the [[Greek temple|temple]] near the [[theatre of Dionysus]] and taken to a temple on the road to Eleutherae. That evening, after [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] and [[hymn]]s, a torchlight procession carried the statue back to the temple, a symbolic re-creation of the god's arrival into Athens, as well as a reminder of the inclusion of the Boeotian town into Attica. As the name Eleutherae is extremely close to eleutheria, 'freedom', Athenians probably felt that the new cult was particularly appropriate for celebrating their own political liberation and democratic reforms." (1992, 15).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Athenian tragedies dramatise events from [[Greek mythology]], though ''[[The Persians]]''—which stages the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] response to news of their military defeat at the [[Battle of Salamis]] in 480 BCE—is the notable exception in the surviving drama.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 442). [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]] argues that in ''[[The Persians]]'' [[Aeschylus]] substitutes for the usual temporal distance between the audience and the [[Greek Heroic Age|age of heroes]] a spatial distance between the Western audience and the Eastern [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian culture]]. This substitution, he suggests, produces a similar effect: "The 'historic' events evoked by the chorus, recounted by the messenger and interpreted by Darius' ghost are presented on stage in a legendary atmosphere. The light that the tragedy sheds upon them is not that in which the political happenings of the day are normally seen; it reaches the Athenian theatre refracted from a distant world of elsewhere, making what is absent seem present and visible on the stage"; Vernant and Vidal-Naquet (1988, 245).&lt;/ref&gt; When Aeschylus won first prize for it at the City Dionysia in 472 BCE, he had been writing tragedies for more than 25 years, yet its tragic treatment of recent history is the earliest example of [[drama]] to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1998, 442) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–16).&lt;/ref&gt; More than 130 years later, the philosopher [[Aristotle]] analysed 5th-century Athenian tragedy in the oldest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]]—his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE).

[[Ancient Greek comedy|Athenian comedy]] is conventionally divided into three periods, "Old Comedy", "Middle Comedy", and "New Comedy". Old Comedy survives today largely in the form of the eleven surviving plays of [[Aristophanes]], while Middle Comedy is largely lost (preserved only in relatively short fragments in authors such as [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]]). New Comedy is known primarily from the substantial papyrus fragments of [[Menander]]. Aristotle defined comedy as a representation of laughable people that involves some kind of blunder or ugliness that does not cause pain or disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a line 1449a]: "Comedy, as we have said, is a representation of inferior people, not indeed in the full sense of the word bad, but the laughable is a species of the base or ugly. It consists in some blunder or ugliness that does not cause pain or disaster, an obvious example being the comic mask which is ugly and distorted but not painful'."&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the categories of comedy and tragedy at the City Dionysia, the festival also included the [[Satyr play|Satyr Play]]. Finding its origins in rural, agricultural rituals dedicated to Dionysus, the satyr play eventually found its way to Athens in its most well-known form. Satyr's themselves were tied to the god Dionysus as his loyal woodland  companions, often engaging in drunken revelry and mischief at his side. The satyr play itself was classified as tragicomedy, erring on the side of the more modern burlesque traditions of the early twentieth century. The plotlines of the plays were typically concerned with the dealings of the pantheon of Gods and their involvement in human affairs, backed by the chorus of [[Satyrs]]. However, according to Webster, satyr actors did not always perform typical satyr actions and would break from the acting traditions assigned to the character type of a mythical forest creature.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, T.B.L. “Monuments Illustrating Tragedy and Satyr Play (Second Edition with Appendix).” Bulletin Supplement (University of London. Institute of Classical Studies), no. 20, 1967, pp. iii–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Rome}}
[[File:Pompeii - Villa del Cicerone - Mosaic - MAN.jpg|thumb|Mosaic depicting masked actors in a play: two women consult a "witch"]]
Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The Roman historian [[Livy]] wrote that the Romans first experienced theatre in the 4th century BCE, with a performance by [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] actors.&lt;ref&gt;Beacham (1996, 2).&lt;/ref&gt; Beacham argues that they had been familiar with "pre-theatrical practices" for some time before that recorded contact.&lt;ref&gt;Beacham (1996, 3).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from [[Roman festival|festival]] performances of [[street theatre]], nude dancing, and [[acrobatics]], to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]], to the [[high culture|high-style]], verbally elaborate [[Tragedy|tragedies]] of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energizing effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of [[Latin literature]] of the highest quality for the stage. The only surviving Roman tragedies, indeed the only plays of any kind from the Roman Empire, are ten dramas- nine of them pallilara- attributed to Lucuis Annaeus Seneca (4 BCE–65 CE), the Corduba-born Stoic philosopher and tutor of Nero.&lt;ref&gt;John, Gassner, and Allen Ralph.

[[File:Kovalan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Koothu]] is an ancient form of performing art that originated in early [[Tamilakam]].]]
The earliest-surviving fragments of [[Sanskrit drama]] date from the 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and  (1998, 516–517).&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516" &gt;Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient ''[[Vedas]]'' ([[hymn]]s from between 1500 and 1000 BCE that are among the earliest examples of [[History of literature#India|literature]] in the world) contain no hint of it (although a small number are composed in a form of [[dialogue]]) and the [[ritual]]s of the [[Vedic period]] do not appear to have developed into theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond516" /&gt; The ''[[Mahābhāṣya]]'' by [[Patañjali]] contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama.&lt;ref name="Richmond517" &gt;Richmond (1998, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise on [[grammar]] from 140 BCE provides a feasible date for the beginnings of [[theatre in India]].&lt;ref name="Richmond517" /&gt;

The major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is ''[[Natyashastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' (''Nātyaśāstra''), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BCE to 200 CE) and whose authorship is attributed to [[Bharata Muni]]. The ''Treatise'' is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses [[acting]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]], [[Theatre architecture|architecture]], [[Costume design|costuming]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] account of the origin of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond517" /&gt; In doing so, it provides indications about the nature of actual theatrical practices. Sanskrit theatre was performed on sacred ground by priests who had been trained in the necessary skills (dance, music, and recitation) in a [hereditary process]. Its aim was both to educate and to entertain.

[[File:കൂടിയാട്ടത്തിലെസുഗ്രീവൻ.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Performer playing [[Sugriva]] in the [[Koodiyattam]] form of [[Sanskrit drama|Sanskrit theatre]].]]

Under the patronage of royal courts, performers belonged to professional companies that were directed by a stage manager (''sutradhara''), who may also have acted.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1998, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This task was thought of as being analogous to that of a [[Puppetry|puppeteer]]—the literal meaning of "''sutradhara''" is "holder of the strings or threads".&lt;ref name="Richmond517" /&gt; The performers were trained rigorously in vocal and physical technique.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1998, 518).&lt;/ref&gt; There were no prohibitions against female performers; companies were all-male, all-female, and of mixed gender. Certain sentiments were considered inappropriate for men to enact, however, and were thought better suited to women. Some performers played characters their own age, while others played ages different from their own (whether younger or older). Of all the elements of theatre, the ''Treatise'' gives most attention to acting (''abhinaya''), which consists of two styles: realistic (''lokadharmi'') and conventional (''natyadharmi''), though the major focus is on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1998, 518). The literal meaning of ''abhinaya'' is "to carry forwards".&lt;/ref&gt;

Its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of [[Sanskrit literature]].&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii" &gt;Brandon (1981, xvii).&lt;/ref&gt; It utilised [[stock character]]s, such as the hero (''nayaka''), heroine (''nayika''), or clown (''vidusaka''). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. [[Kālidāsa]] in the 1st century BCE, is arguably considered to be ancient [[India]]'s greatest Sanskrit dramatist. Three famous romantic plays written by Kālidāsa are the ''[[Mālavikāgnimitram]]'' (''Mālavikā and Agnimitra''), ''[[Vikramuurvashiiya]]'' (''Pertaining to Vikrama and Urvashi''), and ''[[The Recognition of Sakuntala|Abhijñānaśākuntala]]'' (''The Recognition of Shakuntala''). The last was inspired by a story in the ''Mahabharata'' and is the most famous. It was the first to be translated into [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|Śakuntalā]]'' (in English translation) influenced [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' (1808–1832).&lt;ref name="Brandonxvii" /&gt;

The next great Indian dramatist was [[Bhavabhuti]] (c. 7th century CE). He is said to have written the following three plays: ''Malati-Madhava'', ''Mahaviracharita'' and ''Uttar Ramacharita''. Among these three, the last two cover between them the entire epic of ''Ramayana''. The powerful Indian emperor [[Harsha]] (606–648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy ''[[Ratnavali]]'', ''[[Priyadarsika]]'', and the [[Buddhist]] drama ''[[Nagananda]]''.

===Chinese theatre===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Lijiang Yunnan China-Naxi-people-carrying-baskets-01.jpg|thumb|Public performance in Jade Dragon Snow Mountain Open Air Theatre.]]
There are references to theatrical entertainments in China as early as the [[Shang Dynasty]]; they often involved happiness, mimes, and acrobatic displays.The [[Tang Dynasty]] is sometimes known as "The Age of 1000 Entertainments". During this era, Ming Huang formed an acting school known as The [[Pear Garden]] to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical. That is why actors are commonly called "Children of the Pear Garden." During the Dynasty of Empress Ling, [[Shadow play|shadow puppetry]] first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Pekingese (northern) and Cantonese (southern). The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the [[puppets]], as opposed to the type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda.

Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets’ heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather (usually taken from the belly of a donkey).They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the eleventh century before becoming a tool of the government.

In the [[Song Dynasty]], there were many popular plays involving acrobatics and music. These developed in the [[Yuan Dynasty]] into a more sophisticated form known as ''[[zaju]]'', with a four- or five-act structure. Yuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, one of the best known of which is Beijing Opera,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} which is still popular today.

[[Xiangsheng]] is a certain traditional Chinese comedic performance in the forms of monologue or dialogue.

===Post-classical theatre in the West===
{{self-published|Section|date=August 2012}}
Theatre took on many alternate forms in the West between the 15th and 19th centuries, including ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' and [[melodrama]]. The general trend was away from the poetic drama of the Greeks and the [[Renaissance]] and toward a more naturalistic prose style of dialogue, especially following the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuritz (1988, 305).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Obviously, this is just a place-holder, as much is missing. --&gt;

Theatre took a big pause during 1642 and 1660 in England because of the [[Puritans|Puritan]] Interregnum. Theatre was seen as something sinful and the Puritans tried very hard to drive it out of their society. This stagnant period ended once Charles II came back to the throne in 1660 in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]. Theatre (among other arts) exploded, with influence from French culture, since Charles had been exiled in France in the years previous to his reign.

One of the big changes was the new theatre house. Instead of the type of the Elizabethan era, such as the [[Globe Theatre]], round with no place for the actors to really prep for the next act and with no "theatre manners,” the theatre house became transformed into a place of refinement, with a stage in front and stadium seating facing it. Since seating was no longer all the way around the stage, it became prioritized—some seats were obviously better than others. The king would have the best seat in the house: the very middle of the theatre, which got the widest view of the stage as well as the best way to see the point of view and vanishing point that the stage was constructed around. [[Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg]] was one of the most influential set designers of the time because of his use of floor space and scenery.

Because of the turmoil before this time, there was still some controversy about what should and should not be put on the stage. [[Jeremy Collier]], a preacher, was one of the heads in this movement through his piece ''A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage''. The beliefs in this paper were mainly held by non-theatre goers and the remainder of the Puritans and very religious of the time. The main question was if seeing something immoral on stage affects behavior in the lives of those who watch it, a controversy that is still playing out today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Scott R.|title=The English Theatre, 1642–1800|url=http://www.cwu.edu/~robinsos/ppages/resources/Theatre_History/Theahis_10.html|work=Scott R.

[[File:Charles XII High Life below Stairs Mr. Macready 1829.jpg|thumb|Billing for a British theatre in 1829]]

The seventeenth century had also introduced women to the stage, which was considered inappropriate earlier. These women were regarded as celebrities (also a newer concept, thanks to ideas on individualism that arose in the wake of [[Renaissance Humanism]]), but on the other hand, it was still very new and revolutionary that they were on the stage, and some said they were unladylike, and looked down on them. Charles II did not like young men playing the parts of young women, so he asked that women play their own parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Lives Surrounding Late 18th Century Theatre|url=http://engl3621mgc.tripod.com/|work=English 3621 Writing by Women|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because women were allowed on the stage, playwrights had more leeway with plot twists, like women dressing as men, and having narrow escapes from morally sticky situations as forms of comedy.

Comedies were full of the young and very much in vogue, with the storyline following their love lives: commonly a young roguish hero professing his love to the chaste and free minded heroine near the end of the play, much like [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan's]] ''[[The School for Scandal]]''. Many of the comedies were fashioned after the French tradition, mainly Molière, again hailing back to the French influence brought back by the King and the Royals after their exile. [[Molière]] was one of the top comedic playwrights of the time, revolutionizing the way comedy was written and performed by combining Italian [[commedia dell'arte]] and [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] French comedy to create some of the longest lasting and most influential satiric comedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bermel|first=Albert|title=Moliere – French Dramatist|url=http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/Theatre/Moliere/moliere.shtml|work=Discover France|publisher=Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tragedies were similarly victorious in their sense of righting political power, especially poignant because of the recent Restoration of the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Joseph|title=The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: Volume 3: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century|year=2010|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1551116112|pages=533–535|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also imitations of French tragedy, although the French had a larger distinction between comedy and tragedy, whereas the English fudged the lines occasionally and put some comedic parts in their tragedies. Common forms of non-comedic plays were sentimental comedies as well as something that would later be called ''tragédie bourgeoise'', or [[domestic tragedy]]—that is, the tragedy of common life—were more popular in England because they appealed more to English sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthew|first=Brander|title=The Drama in the 18th Century|url=http://www.imagi-nation.com/moonstruck/clsc20w1.html|work=Moonstruch Drama Bookstore|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While theatre troupes were formerly often travelling, the idea of the national theatre gained support in the 18th century, inspired by [[Ludvig Holberg]]. The major promoter of the idea of the national theatre in Germany, and also of the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' poets, was [[Abel Seyler]], the owner of the [[Hamburgische Entreprise]] and the [[Seyler Theatre Company]].&lt;ref name="abel-seyler"&gt;Wilhelm Kosch, "Seyler, Abel", in ''Dictionary of German Biography'', eds. Walther Killy and Rudolf Vierhaus, Vol. 9, Walter de Gruyter, 2005, {{ISBN|3110966298}}, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th century]], the popular theatrical forms of [[Romanticism]], [[melodrama]], [[Victorian burlesque]] and the [[well-made play]]s of [[Eugène Scribe|Scribe]] and [[Victorien Sardou|Sardou]] gave way to the [[problem play]]s of [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] and [[Realism (theatre)|Realism]]; the [[farce]]s of [[Georges Feydeau|Feydeau]]; [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] [[opera]]tic ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]''; [[musical theatre]] (including [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s operas); [[F. C. Burnand]]'s, [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s drawing-room comedies; [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]; proto-[[Expressionism]] in the late works of [[August Strindberg]] and [[Henrik Ibsen]];&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 293–426).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edwardian musical comedy]].

These trends continued through the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]] in the [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] of [[Constantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] and [[Lee Strasberg]], the political theatre of [[Erwin Piscator]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]], the so-called [[Theatre of the Absurd]] of [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Eugène Ionesco]], American and British musicals, the collective creations of companies of actors and directors such as [[Joan Littlewood]]'s [[Theatre Workshop]], experimental and [[postmodern theatre]] of [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] and [[Robert Lepage]], the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] theatre of [[August Wilson]] or [[Tomson Highway]], and [[Augusto Boal]]'s [[Theatre of the Oppressed]].

===Eastern theatrical traditions===
[[File:Demon Yakshagana.jpg|upright|thumb|''[[Rakshasa]]'' or the demon as depicted in [[Yakshagana]], a form of musical [[dance]]-[[drama]] from [[Theatre of India|India]]]]
The first form of [[Theatre of India|Indian theatre]] was the [[Sanskrit drama|Sanskrit theatre]].&lt;ref name="Richmond, Swann 1993"&gt;Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; It began after the development of [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]] and before the development of theatre in other parts of Asia.&lt;ref name="Richmond, Swann 1993"/&gt; It emerged sometime between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE and flourished between the 1st century CE and the 10th, which was a period of relative peace in the [[history of India]] during which hundreds of plays were written.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 70) and Richmond (1998, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese forms of [[Kabuki]], [[Noh|Nō]], and [[Kyōgen]] developed in the 17th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Deal (2007, 276).&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] included [[puppet]] theatre (which included hand puppets, [[shadow play]]s and [[marionette]] productions) and live passion plays known as ''ta'ziya'', where actors re-enact episodes from [[Muslim history]]. In particular, [[Shia Islam]]ic plays revolved around the ''[[Shahid|shaheed]]'' (martyrdom) of [[Ali]]'s sons [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]]. Secular plays were known as ''akhraja'', recorded in medieval ''[[Adab (behavior)|adab]]'' literature, though they were less common than puppetry and ''ta'ziya'' theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Moreh (1986, 565–601).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Drama===
{{main article|Drama}}
[[Drama]] is the specific [[Mode (literature)|mode]] of [[fiction]] [[Mimesis|represented]] in [[performance]].&lt;ref name="elam98"&gt;Elam (1980, 98).&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word meaning "[[Action (philosophy)|action]]", which is derived from the verb δράω, ''dráō'', "to do" or "to act". The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by [[actor]]s on a [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] before an [[audience]], presupposes [[Collaboration|collaborative]] modes of production and a [[collective]] form of reception. The [[Dramatic structure|structure of dramatic texts]], unlike other forms of [[literature]], is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.&lt;ref name="Pfister 1977, 11"&gt;Pfister (1977, 11).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English Renaissance theatre|early modern]] [[tragedy]] ''[[Hamlet]]'' ([[1601 in literature|1601]]) by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|classical Athenian]] tragedy ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (c. 429 BCE) by [[Sophocles]] are among the masterpieces of the art of drama.&lt;ref&gt;Fergusson (1949, 2–3).&lt;/ref&gt; A modern example is ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]'' by [[Eugene O'Neill]] (1956).&lt;ref&gt;Burt (2008, 30–35).&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered as a genre of [[poetry]] in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the [[Epic poetry|epic]] and the [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]] modes ever since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE)—the earliest work of [[dramatic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Fergusson]] writes that "a drama, as distinguished from a [[Lyric poetry|lyric]], is not primarily a composition in the verbal medium; the [[Dialogue (fiction)|words]] result, as one might put it, from the underlying [[Dramatic structure|structure of incident]] and [[Character (arts)|character]]. As [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]] remarks, 'the poet, or "maker" should be the maker of [[Plot (narrative)|plots]] rather than of verses; since he is a poet because he [[Mimesis|imiates]], and what he imitates are [[Action (philosophy)|actions]]'" (1949, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "drama" in the narrow sense to designate a specific ''type'' of [[Play (theatre)|play]] dates from the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th century]]. Drama in this sense refers to a play that is ''neither'' a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, [[Émile Zola|Zola's]] ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' ([[1873 in literature|1873]]) or [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov's]] ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' ([[1887 in literature|1887]]). In Ancient Greece however, the word ''drama'' encompassed all theatrical plays, tragic, comic, or anything in between.

Drama is often combined with [[theatre music|music]] and [[dance]]: the drama in [[opera]] is generally sung throughout; [[Musical theatre|musicals]] generally include both spoken [[dialogue]] and [[song]]s; and some forms of drama have [[incidental music]] or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue ([[melodrama]] and Japanese [[Noh|Nō]], for example).&lt;ref name="cgt"&gt;See the entries for "opera", "musical theatre, American", "melodrama" and "Nō" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In certain periods of history (the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and modern [[Romanticism|Romantic]]) some dramas have been written to be [[Closet drama|read]] rather than performed.&lt;ref name="closet"&gt;While there is some dispute among theatre historians, it is probable that the plays by the Roman [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] were not intended to be performed. ''[[Manfred]]'' by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]] is a good example of a "[[Verse drama and dramatic verse|dramatic poem]]." See the entries on "Seneca" and "Byron (George George)" in Banham (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Improvisational theatre|improvisation]], the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience.&lt;ref name="impro"&gt;Some forms of improvisation, notably the [[Commedia dell'arte]], improvise on the basis of '[[lazzi]]' or rough outlines of scenic action (see Gordon (1983) and Duchartre (1929)). All forms of improvisation take their cue from their immediate response to one another, their characters' situations (which are sometimes established in advance), and, often, their interaction with the audience. The classic formulations of improvisation in the theatre originated with [[Joan Littlewood]] and [[Keith Johnstone]] in the UK and [[Viola Spolin]] in the US; see Johnstone (1981) and Spolin (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical theatre===
{{Main article|Musical theatre}}
[[Music]] and theatre have had a close relationship since ancient times—[[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]], for example, was a form of [[dance]]-[[drama]] that employed a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] whose parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an ''[[aulos]]''—an instrument comparable to the modern [[clarinet]]), as were some of the actors' responses and their 'solo songs' ([[Monody|monodies]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 150n7).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[musical theatre]] is a form of theatre that also combines music, spoken dialogue, and dance. It emerged from [[comic opera]] (especially [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]), [[Variety show|variety]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]] genres of the late [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th]] and early [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2003, 4–11).&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Edwardian musical comedy]] that began in the 1890s, the [[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] musicals of the early 20th century, and comedies in the 1920s and 1930s (such as the works of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]), with ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943), musicals moved in a more dramatic direction.&lt;ref&gt;The first "[[Edwardian musical comedy]]" is usually considered to be ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892), even though it was produced eight years before the beginning of the [[Edwardian era]]; see, for example, Fraser Charlton, [http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/fraser.charlton/edmuscom/page12/edmuscom_what.html "What are EdMusComs?"] (FrasrWeb 2007, accessed May 12, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Famous musicals over the subsequent decades included ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1956), ''[[West Side Story]]'' (1957), ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' (1960), ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' (1967), ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' (1975), ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' (1980), ''[[Into the Woods]]'' (1986), and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = John| last = Kenrick | title = History of Stage Musicals| url = http://www.musicals101.com/erastage.htm| year = 2003| accessdate = May 26, 2009}}&lt;!-- Looking for a printed source in preference to theatre dept's webpage --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as more contemporary hits including ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1994), ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'' (1997), ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' (2003), and ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'' (2015).

Musical theatre may be produced on an intimate scale [[Off-Broadway]], in [[Community theatre|regional theatres]], and elsewhere, but it often includes spectacle. For instance, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[West End theatre|West End]] musicals often include lavish costumes and sets supported by multimillion-dollar budgets.&lt;!-- Need a source that says B/WE musicals often include these, rather than an example --&gt;

[[File:Roman masks.png|thumb|Theatrical masks of Tragedy and Comedy. Mosaic, [[Roman art]]work, 2nd century CE. [[Capitoline Museums]], [[Rome]], [[Italy]]]]

===Comedy===
{{Main article|Comedy}}

Theatre productions that use [[humour]] as a vehicle to tell a story qualify as comedies. This may include a modern [[farce]] such as ''[[Boeing-Boeing (play)|Boeing Boeing]]'' or a classical play such as ''[[As You Like It]]''. Theatre expressing bleak, controversial or taboo subject matter in a deliberately humorous way is referred to as [[black comedy]]. Black Comedy can have several genres like slapstick humour, dark and sarcastic comedy.

===Tragedy===
{{Main article|Tragedy}}
{{quote|Tragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude: in language embellished with each kind of artistic ornament, the several kinds being found in separate parts of the play; in the form of action, not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting the proper purgation of these emotions.|[[Aristotle]]|[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Butcher, [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/poetics/], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle's phrase "several kinds being found in separate parts of the play" is a reference to the structural origins of drama. In it the spoken parts were written in the [[Attic dialect]] whereas the choral (recited or sung) ones in the [[Doric Greek|Doric dialect]], these discrepancies reflecting the differing religious origins and [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metres]] of the parts that were fused into a new entity, the theatrical ''drama''.

[[Tragedy]] refers to a specific [[Poetic tradition|tradition]] of [[drama]] that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 1118) and Williams (1966, 14–16).&lt;/ref&gt; That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of [[cultural identity]] and historical continuity—"the [[Classical Athens|Greeks]] and the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]], in one cultural form; [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenes]] and [[Christian]]s, in a common activity," as [[Raymond Williams]] puts it.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1966, 16).&lt;/ref&gt; From its obscure origins in the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatres of Athens]] 2,500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], through its singular articulations in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], to the more recent [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] tragedy of [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]], [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett's]] [[Modernism|modernist]] meditations on death, loss and suffering, and [[Heiner Müller|Müller's]] [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] reworkings of the tragic canon, tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1966, 13–84) and Taxidou (2004, 193–209).&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make [[genre]] distinctions, whether at the scale of [[poetry]] in general (where the tragic divides against [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[Lyric poetry|lyric]]) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]]). In the [[Modernity|modern]] era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, [[melodrama]], [[Tragicomedy|the tragicomic]], and [[epic theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;See Carlson (1993), Pfister (1977), Elam (1980) and Taxidou (2004). [[Drama]], in the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-[[Genre|generic]] [[deterritorialization]] from the [[Nineteenth century theatre|mid-19th century]] onwards. Both [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Augusto Boal]] define their [[epic theatre]] projects ([[Non-Aristotelian drama]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]] respectively) against models of [[tragedy]]. Taxidou, however, reads epic theatre as an incorporation of tragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation (2004, 193–209).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improvisation===
{{Main article|Improvisational theatre}}
Improvisation has been a consistent feature of theatre, with the Commedia dell'arte in the sixteenth century being recognised as the first improvisation form. Popularized by Nobel Prize Winner [[Dario Fo]] and troupes such as the [[Upright Citizens Brigade]] improvisational theatre continues to evolve with many different streams and philosophies. [[Keith Johnstone]] and [[Viola Spolin]] are recognized as the first teachers of improvisation in modern times, with Johnstone exploring improvisation as an alternative to scripted theatre and Spolin and her successors exploring improvisation principally as a tool for developing dramatic work or skills or as a form for situational comedy. Spolin also became interested in how the process of learning improvisation was applicable to the development of human potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=194|title=The Purpose of Playing: Modern Acting Theories in Perspective|first=Robert|last=Gordon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmAue-VUMmYC&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=Viola%20Spolin%20purpose&amp;pg=PA194#v=onepage&amp;q=Viola%20Spolin%20purpose&amp;f=false|date=2006|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn=978-0472068876}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spolin's son, [[Paul Sills]] popularized improvisational theatre as a theatrical art form when he founded. as its first director, [[the Second City]] in [[Chicago]].

==Theories==
{{Main article|Dramatic theory}}
[[File:Kirmestheater1.JPG|thumb|Village feast with theatre performance circa 1600.]]
Having been an important part of human culture for more than 2,500 years, theatre has evolved a wide range of different [[Dramatic theory|theories]] and practices. Some are related to political or spiritual ideologies, while others are based purely on "artistic" concerns. Some processes focus on a story, some on theatre as event, and some on theatre as catalyst for social change. The [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]], in his seminal treatise, ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE) is the earliest-surviving example and its arguments have influenced theories of theatre ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Dukore (1974, 31) and Janko (1987, ix).&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he offers an account of what he calls "poetry" (a term which in Greek literally means "making" and in this context includes [[drama]]—[[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], [[tragedy]], and the [[satyr play]]—as well as [[lyric poetry]], [[epic poetry]], and the [[dithyramb]]). He examines its "first principles" and identifies its [[genre]]s and basic elements; his analysis of [[tragedy]] constitutes the core of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Poetics'' 1447a13 (1987, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle argues that tragedy consists of six qualitative parts, which are (in order of importance) ''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'' or "plot", ''[[ethos]]'' or "character", ''[[dianoia]]'' or "thought", ''[[Lexis (Aristotle)|lexis]]'' or "diction", ''[[Melos (Aristotle)|melos]]'' or "song", and ''[[opsis]]'' or "spectacle".&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 19) and Janko (1987, xx, 7–10).&lt;/ref&gt; "Although Aristotle's ''Poetics'' is universally acknowledged in the [[Western culture|Western]] critical tradition", [[Marvin Carlson]] explains, "almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions."&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 16).&lt;/ref&gt; Important [[theatre practitioner]]s of the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]] include [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], [[Jacques Copeau]], [[Edward Gordon Craig]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Joan Littlewood]], [[Peter Brook]], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [[Augusto Boal]], [[Eugenio Barba]], [[Dario Fo]], [[Viola Spolin]], [[Keith Johnstone]] and [[Robert Wilson (director)]].

Stanislavski treated the theatre as an [[The arts|art-form]] that is [[Medium specificity|autonomous]] from [[literature]] and one in which the [[playwright]]'s contribution should be respected as that of only one of an ensemble of creative artists.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1999a, 124, 202) and (2008b, 6), Carnicke (1998, 162), and Gauss (1999, 2). In 1902, Stanislavski wrote that "the author writes on paper. The actor writes with his body on the stage" and that the "score of an opera is not the opera itself and the script of a play is not drama until both are made flesh and blood on stage"; quoted by Benedetti (1999a, 124).&lt;/ref&gt; His innovative contribution to modern acting theory has remained at the core of mainstream [[Western culture|western]] performance training for much of the last century.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 1032), Carnicke (1998, 1), Counsell (1996, 24–25), Gordon (2006, 37–40), and Leach (2004, 29).&lt;/ref&gt; That many of the precepts of his [[Stanislavski's system|system of actor training]] seem to be common sense and self-evident testifies to its hegemonic success.&lt;ref name="Counsell 1996, 25"&gt;Counsell (1996, 25).&lt;/ref&gt; Actors frequently employ his basic concepts without knowing they do so.&lt;ref name="Counsell 1996, 25"/&gt; Thanks to its promotion and elaboration by acting teachers who were former students and the many translations of his theoretical writings, Stanislavski's 'system' acquired an unprecedented ability to cross cultural boundaries and developed an international reach, dominating debates about acting in Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 1032), Carnicke (1998, 1, 167), Counsell (1996, 24), and Milling and Ley (2001, 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Many actors routinely equate his 'system' with the North American [[Method acting|Method]], although the latter's exclusively psychological techniques contrast sharply with Stanislavski's multivariant, holistic and [[Psychophysiology|psychophysical]] approach, which explores character and action both from the 'inside out' and the 'outside in' and treats the actor's mind and body as parts of a continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (2005, 147–148) and Carnicke (1998, 1, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical aspects==
[[File:Vienna - Vienna Opera Backstage - 9729.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A theatre stage building]]
{{Main article|Stagecraft}}
Theatre presupposes [[Collaboration|collaborative]] modes of production and a [[collective]] form of reception. The [[Dramatic structure|structure of dramatic texts]], unlike other forms of [[literature]], is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.&lt;ref name="Pfister 1977, 11"/&gt; The production of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] usually involves contributions from a [[playwright]], [[theatre director|director]], a [[Cast member|cast]] of [[actor]]s, and a technical [[production team]] that includes a [[set designer|scenic or set designer]], [[lighting designer]], [[costume designer]], [[sound design]]er, [[Stage management|stage manager]], [[production manager]] and technical director. Depending on the production, this team may also include a [[composer]], [[Dramaturge|dramaturg]], [[video design]]er or [[fight director]].

Stagecraft is a generic term referring to the technical aspects of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes, but is not limited to, constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound. Stagecraft is distinct from the wider umbrella term of scenography. Considered a technical rather than an artistic field, it relates primarily to the practical implementation of a designer's artistic vision.

In its most basic form, stagecraft is managed by a single person (often the stage manager of a smaller production) who arranges all scenery, costumes, lighting, and sound, and organizes the cast. At a more professional level, for example in modern Broadway houses, stagecraft is managed by hundreds of skilled carpenters, painters, electricians, stagehands, stitchers, wigmakers, and the like. This modern form of stagecraft is highly technical and specialized: it comprises many sub-disciplines and a vast trove of history and tradition. The majority of stagecraft lies between these two extremes. Regional theatres and larger community theatres will generally have a technical director and a complement of designers, each of whom has a direct hand in their respective designs.

==Sub-categories and organization==
There are many modern theatre movements which go about producing theatre in a variety of ways. Theatrical enterprises vary enormously in sophistication and purpose. People who are involved vary from novices and hobbyists (in community theatre) to professionals (in Broadway and similar productions). Theatre can be performed with a shoestring budget or on a grand scale with multimillion-dollar budgets. This diversity manifests in the abundance of theatre sub-categories, which include:
* [[Broadway theatre]] and [[West End theatre]]
* [[Community theatre]]
* [[Dinner theater]]
* [[Fringe theatre]]
* [[Off-Broadway]] and [[Off West End]]
* [[Off-Off-Broadway]]
* [[Regional theater in the United States|Regional theatre in the United States]]
* [[Summer stock theatre]]

===Repertory companies===
[[File:Cruikshank Pierce' Egan's Real Life - Drury Lane Theatre 1821.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], London, circa 1821]]
While most modern theatre companies rehearse one piece of theatre at a time, perform that piece for a set "run", retire the piece, and begin rehearsing a new show, [[repertory]] companies rehearse multiple shows at one time. These companies are able to perform these various pieces upon request and often perform works for years before retiring them. Most dance companies operate on this repertory system. The [[Royal National Theatre]] in London performs on a repertory system.

Repertory theatre generally involves a group of similarly accomplished actors, and relies more on the reputation of the group than on an individual star actor. It also typically relies less on strict control by a director and less on adherence to theatrical conventions, since actors who have worked together in multiple productions can respond to each other without relying as much on convention or external direction.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson (1982.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Producing vs. presenting===
In order to put on a piece of theatre, both a theatre company and a [[theatre (structure)|theatre venue]] are needed. When a theatre company is the sole company in residence at a theatre venue, this theatre (and its corresponding theatre company) are called a resident theatre or a producing theatre, because the venue produces its own work. Other theatre companies, as well as dance companies, who do not have their own theatre venue, perform at rental theatres or at presenting theatres. Both rental and presenting theatres have no full-time resident companies. They do, however, sometimes have one or more part-time resident companies, in addition to other independent partner companies who arrange to use the space when available. A rental theatre allows the independent companies to seek out the space, while a presenting theatre seeks out the independent companies to support their work by presenting them on their stage.

Some performance groups perform in non-theatrical spaces. Such performances can take place outside or inside, in a non-traditional performance space, and include [[street theatre]], and [[site-specific theatre]]. Non-traditional venues can be used to create more immersive or meaningful environments for audiences. They can sometimes be modified more heavily than traditional theatre venues, or can accommodate different kinds of equipment, lighting and sets.&lt;ref&gt;Alice T. Carter, "[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_575857.html Non-traditional venues can inspire art, or just great performances] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903150133/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_575857.html |date=2010-09-03 }}", ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'', 2008-07-07. Retrieved 2011-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[touring theatre|touring company]] is an independent theatre or dance company that travels, often internationally, being presented at a different theatre in each city.

===Unions===
There are many theatre unions including: [[Actors' Equity Association]] (for actors and stage managers), the [[Stage Directors and Choreographers Society]] (SDC), and the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] (IATSE, for designers and technicians). Many theatres require that their staff be members of these organizations.

'''Villa Armira''' ({{lang-bg|Вила “Армира”}}) is a 1st-century [[suburb]]an [[Roman villa]] in southeastern [[Bulgaria]], located in the proximity of [[Ivaylovgrad]], [[Haskovo Province]]. Discovered in 1964 during reservoir construction, it is a primary historical attraction to the Ivaylovgrad area.&lt;ref name="petitfute"&gt;{{cite book|last=Auzias|first=Dominique |author2=Jean-Paul Labourdette |author3=Anouck Baudoin |author4=Nevena Panayotova|title=Le Petit Futé Bulgarie|publisher=Petit Futé|date=2008|page=276|chapter=Ivailovgrad: Points d'intérêt|isbn=978-2-7469-2141-2|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is classified as a monument of culture of national importance.&lt;ref name="ivaylovgrad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivaylovgrad.org/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=10 |title=Вила Армира&amp;nbsp;— Паметник на културата с национално значение |publisher=Община Ивайловград |language=Bulgarian |accessdate=2009-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308094633/http://www.ivaylovgrad.org/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=10 |archivedate=March 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Villa Armira lies some {{convert|4|km|mi}} southwest of Ivaylovgrad. It was named after the Armira River, a minor tributary of the [[Arda River (Maritsa)|Arda]]. Villa Armira, a sumptuous palace villa, is one of the largest and most richly decorated [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] villas excavated in Bulgaria. It features rich [[marble]] decoration and complex floor [[mosaic]]s, some geometric and some depicting animals and plants. The villa dates to the second half of the 1st century AD and originally belonged to a noble of Roman [[Thrace]] who is thought to have been the governor of the surrounding area. The two-storey U-shaped villa spreads over {{convert|3600|m2|sqft}} amidst a garden, with an ''[[impluvium]]'' in the middle. Villa Armira had 22 separate rooms on the ground floor alone in addition to a panorama terrace. The entire ground floor was covered in elaborately decorated white marble. The villa's floor mosaics display features typical of Ancient [[Roman art]]. The mosaics in the master's chamber depict the 2nd century AD owner with his two children: these are the only Roman-era mosaic portraits to be discovered in Bulgaria. A common theme in the villa's decoration is the [[gorgon]] [[Medusa]].&lt;ref name="ivaylovgrad"/&gt; In the 3rd century AD, Villa Armira was expanded eastward with a ''[[triclinium]]'' and a [[hypocaust]].&lt;ref name="ivaylovgrad"/&gt;

Villa Armira is thought to have been destroyed in the late 4th century, possibly by the [[Goths]] some time around the [[Battle of Adrianople]] of 378. Today, the 2nd-century mosaic portraits of the owner and his children can be seen in the [[National Historical Museum (Bulgaria)|National Historical Museum]] in [[Sofia]], the ceramic findings are exhibited in the [[National Archaeological Museum (Bulgaria)|National Archaeological Museum]], while copies of the marble decoration are part of the [[Kardzhali]] Regional Historical Museum's fund.&lt;ref name="ivaylovgrad"/&gt; The villa itself, with many of the floor mosaics intact, underwent [[Phare]]-funded reconstruction and [[anastylosis]] and was opened for visitors in 2008.&lt;ref name="bgfactor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bgfactor.org/index_.php?cm=5&amp;ct=16&amp;id=15854|title=Вила "Армира" вече е отворена за посетители|date=2008-07-25|publisher=Български фактор|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virgil Charles Aldrich''' (13 September 1903 in [[Narsinghpur]], [[British India|India]] – 28 May 1998 in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]), was an American [[philosopher of art]], [[Philosophy of language|language]], and [[Philosophy of religion|religion]].

==Early life and education==
The son of Floyd Clement Aldrich and his wife Ann Hanley, Virgil Aldrich earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree at [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in 1925. He studied at [[Oxford University]] in 1927 and then went on to earn a ''[[Diplôme d'Études Supérieures]] de Philosophie'' at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1928 before completing his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of California Berkeley]] in 1931. He married Louise Hafliger on 3 September 1927 and they had one son, David Virgil Aldrich.

==Academic career==
Aldrich's first academic appointment was his appointment as an [[professor|instructor]] in [[philosophy]] at [[Rice University]] in 1931 and Sterling Fellow at [[Yale University]] in 1931-32. Promoted to [[assistant professor]], he remained at Rice until 1942, when he was appointed visiting professor at [[Columbia University]] from 1942 to 1946. Appointed [[professor]] of philosophy at [[Kenyon College]] in 1946, he remained there until 1965, serving as visiting professor at [[Brown University]] in 1962-63. In 1965, he became professor of philosophy at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he remained until his retirement in 1972.  On his retirement, he moved to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], where he became an adjunct professor at the [[University of Utah]].

Aldrich served as Director of the [[Kyoto American Studies Institute]] in [[Japan]] and for short periods was visiting professor at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Michigan]], and [[the University of Texas]].  He served as trustee and president of the [[American Society of Aesthetics]] and president of [[American Philosophical Association]].

=="Some Meanings of Vague" (1937)==

In his article "Some Meanings of Vague",&lt;ref&gt;''Analysis'', Vol. 4, No. 6 (Aug. 1937), pp. 89–95, Published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Analysis Committee.&lt;/ref&gt; Aldrich puts forth a series of definitions of [[vagueness|vague]] objects and [[sensum]], and then argues that any empiricist must account for vague sensum every bit as much as clear sensum, without skirting the issue.  He takes there to be many kinds of vagueness—importantly, there is vagueness of symbols and vagueness of senses.  Here symbols are anything which is used to refer, including verbal words, signs, pictures, and more.  Vagueness regarding symbols can be the same as the vagueness which regards the senses.  There can, additionally, be vagueness of the practices surrounding the use of the symbol to refer.  These, he suggests, should be avoided.

'''''Écriture féminine''''' translates from the [[French language|French]] as "women's writing".&lt;ref&gt;Baldick, Chris. ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Literary Terms''. OUP, 1990. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory, which unpacks the relationship between the cultural and psychological inscription of the female body and female difference in language and text,&lt;ref&gt;[[Elaine Showalter|Showalter, Elaine]]. Critical Inquiry, Vol. 8, No. 2, Writing and Sexual Difference, (Winter, 1981), pp. 179-205. Published by: The University of Chicago Press. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1343159&lt;/ref&gt; is a strain of [[Feminism in France|feminist literary theory that originated in France]] in the early 1970s through the work of theorists including [[Hélène Cixous]], [[Monique Wittig]], [[Luce Irigaray]],&lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, Luce, ''Speculum of the Other Woman'', Cornell University Press, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chantal Chawaf]],&lt;ref&gt;Cesbron, Georges, " Ecritures au féminin. Propositions de lecture pour quatre livres de femmes" in Degré Second, juillet 1980: 95-119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mistacco, Vicki, "Chantal Chawaf," in Les femmes et la tradition litteraire - Anthologie du Moyen Âge à nos jours; Seconde partie: XIXe-XXIe siècles, Yale Press, 2006, 327-343&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catherine Clément]], and [[Julia Kristeva]]&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, Julia  ''Revolution in Poetic Language'', Columbia University Press, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, "To Inscribe in the Feminine: A Kristevan Impossibility? Or Femininity, Melancholy and Sublimation." ''Parallax, n. 8'', [Vol. 4(3)], 1998. 81-117.&lt;/ref&gt; and has subsequently been extended by writers such as psychoanalytic theorist [[Bracha Ettinger]],&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Bracha, ''Matrix . Halal(a) - Lapsus. Notes on Painting, 1985-1992''. MOMA, Oxford, 1993. ({{ISBN|0-905836-81-2}}). Reprinted in: ''Artworking 1985-1999''. Edited by Piet Coessens. Ghent-Amsterdam: Ludion / Brussels: Palais des Beaux-Arts, 2000. ({{ISBN|90-5544-283-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Bracha, ''The Matrixial Borderspace'' (essays 1994-1999), Minnesota University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; who emerged in this field in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Griselda, "Does Art Think?", in: ''Art and Thought'' Blackwell, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Écriture féminine as a theory foregrounds the importance of language for the psychic understanding of self. The theory draws on the foundational work in psychoanalysis about the way that humans come to understand their social roles. In doing so, it goes on to expound how women, who may be positioned as 'other' in a masculine symbolic order, can reaffirm their understanding of the world through engaging with their own outsiderness.&lt;ref&gt;"Murfin, Ross C." http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~rlbeebe/what_is_feminist_criticism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cixous==

[[Hélène Cixous]] first coined ''écriture féminine'' in her essay, "[[Hélène Cixous#The Laugh of the Medusa (1975)|The Laugh of the Medusa]]" (1975), where she asserts "woman must write her self: must write about women and bring women to writing, from which they have been driven away as violently as from their bodies" because their sexual pleasure has been repressed and denied expression. Inspired by Cixous' essay, a recent book titled ''Laughing with Medusa'' (2006) analyzes the collective work of [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Bracha Ettinger]] and [[Hélène Cixous]].&lt;ref&gt;Zajko, Vanda and Leonard, Miriam, ''Laughing with Medusa''. Oxford University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These writers are as a whole referred to by Anglophones as "the French feminists," though Mary Klages, Associate Professor in the English Department at the University of Colorado at Boulder, has pointed out that [[Post-structural feminism|"poststructuralist theoretical feminists"]] would be a more accurate term.&lt;ref name="Klages" /&gt; [[Madeleine Gagnon]] is a more recent proponent. And since the aforementioned 1975 when Cixous also founded women's studies at Vincennes, she has been as a spokeswoman for the group ''Psychanalyse et politique'' and a prolific writer of texts for their publishing house, ''des femmes''. And when asked of her own writing she says, "''Je suis là où ça parle''" ("I am there where it/id/the female unconscious speaks.") &lt;ref&gt;Jones, Ann Rosalind. Feminist Studies, Vol. 7, No. 2 (Summer, 1981), pp. 247-263. Published by: Feminist Studies, Inc. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3177523&lt;/ref&gt;

American feminist critic and writer [[Elaine Showalter]] defines this movement as "the inscription of the feminine body and female difference in language and text."&lt;ref&gt;Showalter, Elaine. "Feminist Criticism in the Wilderness." ''The New Feminist Criticism: essays on women, literature, and theory''. Elaine Showalter, ed. London: Virago, 1986. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Écriture féminine'' places experience before language, and  privileges non-linear, cyclical writing that evades "the discourse that regulates the [[phallogocentrism|phallocentric]] system."&lt;ref&gt;Cixous, Hélène. "The Laugh of the Medusa." ''New French Feminisms''. Elaine Marks and Isabelle de Courtivron, eds. New York: Schocken, 1981. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Because language is not a neutral medium, it can be said to function as an instrument of patriarchal expression. As Peter Barry writes, “the female writer is seen as suffering the handicap of having to use a medium (prose writing) which is essentially a male instrument fashioned for male purposes”.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Peter. ''Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory''. New York: Manchester UP, 2002. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Ecriture féminine'' thus exists as an antithesis of masculine writing or as a means of escape for women.&lt;ref&gt;However, the phallogocentric argument has been criticised by W. A. Borody as misrepresenting the history of philosophies of ‘’indeterminateness’’ in Western culture.  Borody claims that the "black and white" view that the masculine = determinateness and the feminine = indeterminateness contains a degree of cultural and historical validity, but not when it is deployed to self-replicate a form of gender-othering it originally sought to overcome. See Wayne A. Borody (1998) pp. 3, 5 "[http://kenstange.com/nebula/feat013/feat013.html Figuring the Phallogocentric Argument with Respect to the Classical Greek Philosophical Tradition]." ''Nebula: A Netzine of the Arts and Science'', Vol. 13 (pp. 1-27).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of Rosemarie Tong, “Cixous challenged women to write themselves out of the world men constructed for women. She urged women to put themselves-the unthinkable/unthought-into words.”&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie Putnam 2008"&gt;Tong, Rosemarie Putnam. Feminist Thought : A More Comprehensive Introduction. New York: Westview P, 2008.276.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Almost everything is yet to be written by women about femininity: about their sexuality, that is, its infinite and mobile complexity; about their eroticization, sudden turn-ons of a certain minuscule-immense area of their bodies; not about destiny, but about the adventure of such and such a drive, about trips, crossings, trudges, abrupt and gradual awakenings, discoveries of a zone at once timorous and soon to be forthright.&lt;ref name=Klages&gt;Klages, Mary. "[http://www.colorado.edu/English/courses/ENGL2012Klages/cixous.html Helene Cixous: The Laugh of the Medusa]."&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With regard to [[Phallogocentrism|phallogocentric writing]], Tong argues that "male sexuality, which centers on what Cixous called the "big dick", is ultimately boring in its pointedness and singularity. Like male sexuality, masculine writing, which Cixous usually termed phallogocentric writing, is also ultimately boring" and furthermore, that "stamped with the official seal of social approval, masculine writing is too weighted down to move or change".&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosemarie Putnam 2008" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Write, let no one hold you back, let nothing stop you: not man; not the imbecilic capitalist machinery, in which the publishing houses are the crafty, obsequious relayers of imperatives handed down by an economy that works against us and off our backs; not ''yourself''. Smug-faced readers, managing editors, and big bosses don't like the true texts of women- female-sexed texts. That kind scares them.&lt;ref&gt;Hélène Cixous, Summer 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Cixous, ''écriture féminine'' is not only a possibility for female writers; rather, she believes it can be (and has been) employed by male authors such as [[James Joyce]] or [[Jean Genet]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Some have found this idea difficult to reconcile with Cixous’ definition of ''écriture féminine'' (often termed ‘white ink’) because of the many references she makes to the female body (“There is always in her at least a little of that good mother’s milk. She writes in white ink”.&lt;ref&gt;Klages, Mary. "Helene Cixous: 'The Laugh of the Medusa.&lt;/ref&gt;) when characterizing the essence of écriture féminine and explaining its origin. This notion raises problems for some theorists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''Ecriture féminine'', then, is by its nature transgressive, rule-transcending, intoxicated, but it is clear that the notion as put forward by Cixous raises many problems. The realm of the body, for instance, is seen as somehow immune to social and gender condition and able to issue forth a pure essence of the feminine. Such essentialism is difficult to square with feminism which emphasizes femininity as a social construction…"&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Peter. ''Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory''. New York: Manchester UP, 2002.128.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Irigaray and Kristeva==

For Luce Irigaray, women's sexual pleasure ''[[jouissance]]'' cannot be expressed by the dominant, ordered, "logical," masculine language because, according to Kristeva, feminine language is derived from the pre-oedipal period of fusion between mother and child which she termed [[Julia Kristeva#The semiotic|the semiotic]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garrattt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with the maternal, feminine language (which Irigaray called ''parler femme'', womanspeak)&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; is not only a threat to culture, which is patriarchal, but also a medium through which women may be creative in new ways. Irigaray expressed this connection between women's sexuality and women's language through the following analogy: women's ''jouissance'' is more multiple than men's unitary, phallic pleasure because &lt;ref&gt;Murfin, Ross C. http://www.ux1.eiu.edu/~rlbeebe/what_is_feminist_criticism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"woman has sex organs just about everywhere...feminine language is more diffusive than its 'masculine counterpart'. That is undoubtedly the reason...her language...goes off in all directions and...he is unable to discern the coherence." &lt;ref&gt;Irigaray, Luce. [[This Sex]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irigaray and Cixous also go on to emphasize that women, historically limited to being sexual objects for men (virgins or prostitutes, wives or mothers), have been prevented from expressing their sexuality in itself or for themselves. If they can do this, and if they can speak about it in the new languages it calls for, they will establish a point of view (a site of difference) from which phallogocentric concepts and controls can be seen through and taken apart, not only in theory, but also in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Ann Rosalind. Feminist Studies, Vol. 7, No. 2 (Summer, 1981), pp. 247-263. Published by: Feminist Studies, Inc. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3177523.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==

The approach through language to feminist action has been criticised by some as over-theoretical: they would see the fact that the very first meeting of a handful of would-be feminist activists in 1970 only managed to launch an acrimonious theoretical debate as marking the situation as typically 'French' in its apparent insistence on the primacy of theory over politics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toril Moi|Moi, Toril, ed.]] ''French Feminist Thought''. Basil Blackwell Ltd, 1987. ({{ISBN|0-631-14972-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in practice the French women's movement developed in much the same way as the feminist movements elsewhere in Europe or in the United States: French women participated in consciousness-raising groups; demonstrated in the streets on the [[International Women's Day|8 March]]; fought hard for women's right to choose whether to have children; raised the issue of violence against women; and struggled to change public opinion on issues concerning women and women's rights.

Further criticisms of écriture féminine include its essentialist view of the body; its over-reliance on a feminism of 'difference'; and its tendency to demonise not only the masculine but those (many) women authors who write or have written in more conventional, linear literary forms.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Holmes, ''French Women's Writings, 1848-1994'' (1996) p. 228-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==

As a result of the difficulties inherent in the notion of "écriture féminine", very few books of literary criticism have run the risk of using it as a critical tool.&lt;ref&gt;See however Frédéric Regard, ''L'écriture féminine en Angleterre'', Paris, Presses Universitaires de France, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. S. Byatt]] offers: "There is a marine and salty female wave-water to be...read as a symbol of female language, which is partly suppressed, partly self-communing, dumb before the intruding male and not able to speak out...thus mirroring those female secretions which are not inscribed in our daily use of language (''langue'', tongue)".&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Byatt, ''Possession: A Romance'' (1990) p. 244-5&lt;/ref&gt;
