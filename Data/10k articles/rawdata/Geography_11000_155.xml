[[File:97 Bowery Building.jpg|thumb|(2013)]]

The '''97 Bowery Building''' is a five-story loft building on [[The Bowery]] between [[Hester Street (Manhattan)|Hester]] and [[Grand Street (Manhattan)|Grand]] Streets in the [[Lower East Side]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].  

The building was designed by Peter L.P. Tostevin in the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]], and was built in 1869 for John P. Jube &amp; Co., which occupied it until 1935.  The building has a [[cast-iron architecture|cast-iron facade]] from the J. B. &amp; W. W. Cornell Iron Works, the details of which were most likely chosen from a catalog. As such, it is typical of cast-iron construction in the 1850s and 1860s.  At the time it was built, the Bowery was the primary commercial street of the Lower East Side.  Today, the building is a rare cast-iron survivor in the area, as well as a reminder of the importance of the Bowery as a commercial center after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name=desrep&gt;Noonan, Theresa (September 14, 2010) [http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/2353.pdf "97 Bowery Building Designation Report"] [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt;

97 Bowery was designated a [[New York City Landmark]] by the [[New York City Landmark Preservation Commission]] on September 14, 2010.&lt;ref name=desrep /&gt;

      <comment>/* Climate */ remove these statements. purely original research and synthesis since the nationmaster source only lists the climate types; it doesn't have any info on how it it's climate is diverse in the southern hemisphere (proof for that claim?). also, using probably and second person pronouns is not proper writing. add a brief intro in how argentina's climate is best divided into four main climate types that provides a transition to next sentence (taken from climate of argentina article)</comment>

'''Argentina''' ({{IPA-es|aɾxenˈtina|lang}}), officially named the '''Argentine Republic'''{{efn-ua|name=altnames}} ({{lang-es|link=no|República Argentina}}),&lt;!-- {{IPA-es|reˈpuβlika aɾxenˈtina}} --&gt; is a country located mostly in the southern half of [[South America]]. Sharing the bulk of the [[Southern Cone]] with [[Chile]] to the west, the country is also bordered by [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] to the north, [[Brazil]] to the northeast, [[Uruguay]] and the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] to the east, and the [[Drake Passage]] to the south. With a mainland area of {{convert|2780400|km2|mi2|abbr=on}},{{efn-ua|name=excl_area}} Argentina is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|eighth-largest country]] in the world, the fourth largest in [[the Americas]], and the largest [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking]] nation. The [[sovereign state]] is subdivided into twenty-three [[province]]s ({{lang-es|provincias}}, singular ''provincia'') and one [[autonomous city]] (''ciudad autónoma''), [[Buenos Aires]],  which is the [[federal capital]] of the nation ({{lang-es|Capital Federal|links=no}}) as decided by [[Argentine Congress|Congress]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 3}} The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a [[federal system]]. Argentina claims sovereignty over [[Argentine Antarctica|part of Antarctica]], the [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|Falkland Islands]] ({{lang-es|Islas Malvinas|links=no}}), and [[South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands sovereignty dispute|South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].

The earliest recorded human presence in the area of modern-day Argentina dates back to the [[Paleolithic]] period.{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|p=17}} The country has its roots in [[Spanish empire|Spanish colonization]] of the region during the 16th century.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=128}} Argentina rose as the successor state of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]],{{sfnm|1a1=Levene|1y=1948|1p=11|1ps=: "[After the Viceroyalty became] a new period that commenced with the revolution of 1810, whose plan consisted in declaring the independence of a nation, thus turning the legal bond of vassalage into one of citizenship as a component of sovereignty and, in addition, organizing the democratic republic."|2a1=Sánchez Viamonte|2y=1948|2pp=196–197|2ps=: "The Argentine nation was a unity in colonial times, during the Viceroyalty, and remained so after the revolution of May 1810. [...] The provinces never acted as independent sovereign states, but as entities created within the nation and as integral parts of it, incidentally affected by internal conflicts."|3a1=Vanossi|3y=1964|3p=11|3ps=: "[The Argentine nationality is a] unique national entity, successor to the Viceroyalty, which, after undergoing a long period of anarchy and disorganization, adopted a decentralized form in 1853–1860 under the Constitution."}} a Spanish [[viceroyalty|overseas viceroyalty]] founded in 1776. The [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declaration]] and [[Argentine War of Independence|fight for independence]] (1810–1818) was followed by an [[Argentine Civil Wars|extended civil war]] that lasted until 1861, culminating in the country's reorganization as a [[federation]] of [[Provinces of Argentina|provinces]] with [[Buenos Aires]] as its capital city. The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability, with [[Immigration in Argentina|several waves of European immigration]] radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook. The almost-unparalleled increase in prosperity led to Argentina becoming the seventh wealthiest developed nation in the world by the early 20th century.{{sfn|Bolt|Van Zanden|2013}}{{sfn|Díaz Alejandro|1970|p=1}}

After 1930, Argentina descended into political instability and periodic economic crises that pushed it back into underdevelopment,&lt;ref name=developed&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/2704457|title=Becoming a serious country|work=The Economist|place=London|date=3 June 2004|quote=Argentina is thus not a "developing country".

She was overthrown in 1976 by a U.S.-backed [[1976 Argentine coup d'état|coup]] which installed a [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[military dictatorship]] under [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] known as the [[National Reorganization Process]]. The military government persecuted and murdered numerous political critics, activists, and leftists in the [[Dirty War]], a period of [[state terrorism]] that lasted until the election of [[Raúl Alfonsín]] as President in 1983.

==Name and etymology==
The description of the country by the word ''Argentina'' has been found on a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] map in 1536.&lt;ref&gt;The name ''Argentine'' (Spanish) [http://www.oni.escuelas.edu.ar/olimpi99/libros-digitales/html/argentin.htm El nombre de Argentina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175318/http://www.oni.escuelas.edu.ar/olimpi99/libros-digitales/html/argentin.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English the name "Argentina" comes from the [[Spanish language]], however the naming itself is not Spanish, but [[Italian language|Italian]]. ''Argentina'' ([[Grammatical gender|masculine]] ''argentino'') means in Italian "(made) of silver, silver coloured", probably borrowed from the  [[French language|Old French]] adjective ''argentine'' "(made) of silver" &gt; "silver coloured" already mentioned in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/argentin Etymology of ''argentin / -e'' (French)]&lt;/ref&gt; The French word ''argentine'' is the [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] form of ''argentin'' and derives from ''argent'' "silver" with the [[suffix]] ''-in'' (same construction as Old French ''acerin'' "(made) of steel", from ''acier'' "steel" + ''-in'' or ''sapin'' "(made) of fir wood", from OF ''sap'' "fir" + ''-in''). The Italian naming "Argentina" for the country implies ''Terra Argentina'' "land of silver" or ''Costa Argentina'' "coast of silver". In Italian, the adjective or the [[proper noun]] is often used in an autonomous way as a substantive and replaces it and it is said ''l'Argentina''.

The name ''Argentina'' was probably first given by the Venetian and Genoese navigators, such as [[Giovanni Caboto]]. In Spanish and Portuguese, the words for "silver" are respectively ''plata'' and ''prata'' and "(made) of silver" is said ''plateado'' and ''prateado''. ''Argentina'' was first associated with the [[Sierra de la Plata|silver mountains legend]], widespread among the first European explorers of the [[La Plata Basin]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rock|1y=1987|1pp=6, 8|2a1=Edwards|2y=2008|2p=7}}

The first written use of the name in Spanish can be traced to ''[[La Argentina (poem)|La Argentina]]'',{{efn-ua|The poem's full name is ''La Argentina y conquista del Río de la Plata, con otros acaecimientos de los reinos del Perú, Tucumán y estado del Brasil''.}} a 1602 poem by [[Martín del Barco Centenera]] describing the region.{{sfn|Traba|1985|pp=15, 71}}
Although "Argentina" was already in common usage by the 18th century, the country was formally named "Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata" by the Spanish Empire, and "United Provinces of the Río de la Plata" after independence.

The [[Argentine Constitution of 1826|1826 constitution]] included the first use of the name "Argentine Republic" in legal documents.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=1826, art. 1}}
The name "Argentine Confederation" was also commonly used and was formalized in the [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=1853, Preamble}}
In 1860 a presidential decree settled the country's name as "Argentine Republic",{{sfn|Rosenblat|1964|p=78}} and that year's constitutional amendment ruled all the names since 1810 as legally valid.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=1860 amd., art. 35}}{{efn-ua|Also stated in article 35 of all subsequent amendments: 1866, 1898, 1949, 1957, 1972 and 1994 (current)}}

In the [[English language]] the country was traditionally called "the Argentine", mimicking the typical Spanish usage ''la Argentina''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Argentina|title=Definition of Argentina in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English)|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|place=Oxford, UK|date=6 May 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305011413/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Argentina|archivedate=5 March 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps resulting from a mistaken shortening of the fuller name 'Argentine Republic'. 'The Argentine' fell out of fashion during the mid-to-late 20th century, and now the country is simply referred to as "Argentina".

In the [[Spanish language]] "Argentina" is [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] ("''La [República] Argentina''"), taking the feminine [[article (grammar)|article]] "La" as the initial syllable of "Argentina" is [[Stress (linguistics)|unstressed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studyspanish.com/lessons/defart2.htm "The Definite Article: Part II"], Study Spanish&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest traces of human life in the area now known as Argentina are dated from the [[Paleolithic]] period, with further traces in the [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]].{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|p=17}}
Until the period of European colonization, Argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a wide number of diverse cultures with different social organizations,{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=12}} which can be divided into three main groups.{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|pp=18–19}} The first group are basic hunters and food gatherers without development of [[pottery]], such as the [[Selknam]] and [[Yaghan]] in the extreme south. The second group are advanced hunters and food gatherers which include the [[Puelche]], [[Querandí]] and Serranos in the center-east; and the [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]] in the south—all of them conquered by the [[Mapuche]] spreading from [[Chile]]{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=13}}—and the [[Kom people (South America)|Kom]] and [[Wichi]] in the north. The last group are farmers with pottery, like the [[Charrúa]], [[Minuane]] and [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] in the northeast, with [[slash and burn agriculture|slash and burn]] semisedentary existence;{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=12}} the advanced [[Diaguita]] sedentary [[trade|trading culture]] in the northwest, which was conquered by the [[Inca Empire]] around 1480; the [[Toconoté]] and [[Comechingones|Hênîa and Kâmîare]] in the country's center, and the [[Huarpe]] in the center-west, a culture that raised [[llama]] cattle and was strongly influenced by the Incas.{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=12}}

===Colonial era===
{{main|Colonial Argentina}}
{{see also|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}

Europeans first arrived in the region with the 1502 voyage of [[Amerigo Vespucci (explorer)|Amerigo Vespucci]]. The Spanish navigators [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] and [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] visited the territory that is now Argentina in 1516 and 1526, respectively.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=128}} In 1536 [[Pedro de Mendoza]] founded the small settlement of [[Buenos Aires]], which was abandoned in 1541.{{sfn|Crow|1992|pp=129–132}}

Further colonization efforts came from [[Paraguay]]—establishing the [[Governorate of the Río de la Plata]]—[[Peru]] and Chile.{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|pp=96–140}}
[[Francisco de Aguirre (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguirre]] founded [[Santiago del Estero]] in 1553. [[Londres, Catamarca|Londres]] was founded in 1558; [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], in 1561; [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], in 1562; [[San Miguel de Tucumán]], in 1565.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=353}} [[Juan de Garay]] founded [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] in 1573 and the same year [[Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera]] set up [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=134}} Garay went further south to re-found Buenos Aires in 1580.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=135}} [[San Luis, Argentina|San Luis]] was established in 1596.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=353}}

The [[Spanish Empire]] subordinated the economic potential of the Argentine territory to the immediate wealth of the silver and gold mines in [[Bolivia]] and Peru, and as such it became part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] until the creation of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] in 1776 with Buenos Aires as its capital.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=347}}

Buenos Aires repelled [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata|two ill-fated British invasions]] in 1806 and 1807.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=421}} The ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the example of the first [[Atlantic Revolutions]] generated criticism of the [[absolutist monarchy]] that ruled the country. As in the rest of Spanish America, the overthrow of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] during the [[Peninsular War]] created great concern.{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|pp=194ff}}

In the first clashes of the Independence War the Junta crushed a royalist [[Liniers Counter-revolution|counter-revolution in Córdoba]],{{sfn|Rock|1987|p=81}} but failed to overcome those of the [[Banda Oriental]], [[First Upper Peru campaign|Upper Peru]] and [[Paraguay campaign|Paraguay]], which later became independent states.{{sfn|Rock|1987|pp=82–83}}

Revolutionaries split into two antagonist groups: the [[Unitarian Party|Centralists]] and the [[Federales (Argentina)|Federalists]]—a move that would define Argentina's first decades of independence.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=39–40}} The [[Assembly of the Year XIII]] appointed [[Gervasio Antonio de Posadas]] as Argentina's first [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata|Supreme Director]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=39–40}}

On 9 July 1816, the [[Congress of Tucumán]] formalized the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]],{{sfnm|1a1=Rock|1y=1987|1p=92|2a1=Lewis|2y=2003|2p=41}} which is now celebrated as Independence Day, a national holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.argentina.gob.ar/interior/feriados |title=Feriados nacionales 2018 |trans-title=National Holidays 2018 |publisher=Argentina Ministry of the Interior |language=es |access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later General [[Martín Miguel de Güemes]] stopped royalists on the north, and General [[José de San Martín]] took an army [[Crossing of the Andes|across the Andes]] and secured the [[independence of Chile]]; then he led the fight to the Spanish stronghold of [[Lima]] and proclaimed the [[independence of Peru]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

The 1820 [[Battle of Cepeda (1820)|Battle of Cepeda]], fought between the Centralists and the Federalists, resulted in the ''end of the Supreme Director rule''. In 1826 Buenos Aires enacted another [[Argentine Constitution of 1826|centralist constitution]], with [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] being appointed as the first president of the country. However, the interior provinces soon rose against him, forced his resignation and discarded the constitution.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=43}} Centralists and Federalists resumed the civil war; the latter prevailed and formed the [[Argentine Confederation]] in 1831, led by [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=45}} During his regime he faced a [[French blockade to the Río de la Plata|French blockade]] (1838–1840), the [[War of the Confederation]] (1836–1839), and a combined [[Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata|Anglo-French blockade]] (1845–1850), but remained undefeated and prevented further loss of national territory.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=46–47}} His trade restriction policies, however, angered the interior provinces and in 1852 [[Justo José de Urquiza]], another powerful [[caudillo]], [[Battle of Caseros|beat him out of power]]. As new president of the Confederation, Urquiza enacted the [[liberalism|liberal]] and federal 1853 Constitution. [[State of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires seceded]] but was forced back into the Confederation after being defeated in the 1859 [[Battle of Cepeda (1859)|Battle of Cepeda]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=48–50}}

Starting with [[Julio Argentino Roca]] in 1880, ten consecutive federal governments emphasized [[economic liberalism|liberal economic policies]]. The [[Immigration in Argentina|massive wave of European immigration]] they promoted—second only to the United States'—led to a near-reinvention of Argentine society and economy that by 1908 had placed the country as the seventh wealthiest{{sfn|Bolt|Van Zanden|2013}} developed nation{{sfn|Díaz Alejandro|1970|p=1}} in the world.
Driven by this [[immigration]] wave and decreasing mortality, the Argentine population grew fivefold and the economy 15-fold:{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=18–30}} from 1870 to 1910 Argentina's [[wheat]] exports went from {{convert|100000|to|2500000|MT|ST|abbr=on}} per year, while frozen beef exports increased from {{convert|25000|to|365000|MT|ST|abbr=on}} per year,{{sfn|Mosk|1990|pp=88–89}} placing Argentina as one of the world's top five exporters.{{sfn|Cruz|1990|p=10}} Its railway mileage rose from {{convert|503|to|31104|km|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Díaz Alejandro|1970|pp=2–3}} Fostered by a new [[Argentine Law 1420|public, compulsory, free and secular education]] system, [[literacy]] skyrocketed from 22% to 65%, a level higher than most [[Latin America]]n nations would reach even fifty years later.{{sfn|Cruz|1990|p=10}} Furthermore, real [[GDP]] grew so fast that despite the huge immigration influx, [[per capita income]] between 1862 and 1920 went from 67% of developed country levels to 100%:{{sfn|Díaz Alejandro|1970|pp=2–3}} In 1865, Argentina was already one of the top 25 nations by per capita income. By 1908, it had surpassed Denmark, Canada and The Netherlands to reach 7th place—behind Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Belgium. Argentina's per capita income was 70% higher than Italy's, 90% higher than Spain's, 180% higher than Japan's and 400% higher than [[Brazil]]'s.{{sfn|Bolt|Van Zanden|2013}} Despite these unique achievements, the country was slow to meet its original goals of industrialization:{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

{{main|Peronism}}
Perón created a political movement known as Peronism. He [[nationalization|nationalized]] strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full [[external debt]] and achieved nearly [[full employment]]. The economy, however, began to decline in 1950 because of over-expenditure. His highly popular wife, [[Eva Perón]], played a central political role. She pushed Congress to enact [[women's suffrage]] in 1947,{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=3}} and developed an unprecedented social assistance to the most vulnerable sectors of society.{{sfn|Barnes|1978|pp=113ff}} However, her declining health did not allow her to run for the vice-presidency in 1951, and she died of cancer the following year. Perón [[Argentine general election, 1951|was reelected in 1951]], surpassing even his 1946 performance. In 1955 the Navy [[bombing of Plaza de Mayo|bombed the Plaza de Mayo]] in an ill-fated attempt to kill the President. A few months later, during the self-called [[Revolución Libertadora|Liberating Revolution]] coup, he resigned and went into [[exile]] in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=303–351}}

===Military dictatorship, the Dirty War and defeat in the Falklands War===
{{main|Dirty War}}
The "Dirty War" ({{lang-es|Guerra Sucia|links=no}}) was part of [[Operation Condor]] which included participation of the right-wing dictatorships of the Southern Cone. The Dirty War involved [[state terrorism]] in Argentina and elsewhere in the [[Southern Cone]] against political dissidents, with military and security forces employing urban and rural violence against left-wing guerrillas, political dissidents, and anyone believed to be associated with socialism or somehow contrary to the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;''Political Violence and Trauma in Argentina'', Antonius C.

Declassified documents of the Chilean secret police cite an official estimate by the [[Batallón de Inteligencia 601]] of 22,000 killed or "disappeared" between 1975 and mid-1978. During this period, in which it was later revealed 8,625 "disappeared" in the form of PEN (''Poder Ejecutivo Nacional'', anglicized as "National Executive Power") detainees who were held in clandestine detention camps throughout Argentina before eventually being freed under diplomatic pressure.&lt;ref&gt;''Political Injustice: Authoritarianism and the Rule of Law in Brazil, Chile, and Argentina'', Anthony W. Pereira, p. 134, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people believed to have been killed or "disappeared", depending on the source, range from 9,089 to 30,000 in the period from 1976 to 1983, when the military was forced from power following Argentina's defeat in the [[Falklands War]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian, Thursday 2 April 2009"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/02/obituary-raul-alfonsin Obituary] ''The Guardian'', Thursday 2 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Estimate of Deaths and Disappearances by 601st Intelligence Battalion|date=July 1978|publisher=DINA Headquarters, Buenos Aires, Argentina|pages=A8|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB185/19780715%20%5BReport%20on%20Argentina%27s%20dissappeared%5D%20A0000514c.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] estimates that around 13,000 were disappeared.&lt;ref name="edant.clarin.com"&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/10/06/p-00801.htm "Una duda histórica: no se sabe cuántos son los desaparecidos"], ''Clarin'', 10 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

After democratic government was restored, Congress passed legislation to provide compensation to victims' families. Some 11,000 Argentines have applied to the relevant authorities and received up to US $200,000 each as monetary compensation for the murder of loved ones during the military dictatorship.&lt;ref name="Wright, Thomas C. p. 158"&gt;Wright, Thomas C. ''State terrorism in Latin America'', p. 158, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact chronology of the [[political repression|repression]] is still debated, however, as in some senses the long political war started in 1969. Trade unionists were targeted for assassination by the Peronist and Marxist paramilitaries as early as 1969, and individual cases of [[state-sponsored terrorism]] against Peronism and the left can be traced back to the [[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo]] in 1955. The [[Trelew massacre]] of 1972, the actions of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] since 1973, and [[Isabel Martínez de Perón]]'s "annihilation decrees" against left-wing guerrillas during ''[[Operativo Independencia]]'' (translates to Operation of Independence) in 1975, have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty War.

Onganía shut down Congress, banned all political parties and dismantled student and worker unions. In 1969, popular discontent led to two massive protests: the ''[[Cordobazo]]'' and the ''[[Rosariazo]]''. The terrorist guerrilla organization [[Montoneros]] kidnapped and executed Aramburu.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=127}} The newly chosen head of government, [[Alejandro Agustín Lanusse]], seeking to ease the growing political pressure, let [[Héctor José Cámpora]] be the Peronist candidate instead of Perón. Cámpora won the [[Argentine general election, March 1973|March 1973 election]], issued a [[amnesty|pardon]] for condemned guerrilla members and then secured Perón's return from his exile in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=423–465}}

On the day Perón returned to Argentina, the clash between Peronist internal factions—[[right-wing]] union leaders and [[left-wing]] youth from Montoneros—resulted in the [[Ezeiza Massacre]]. Cámpora resigned, overwhelmed by political violence, and Perón won the [[Argentine general election, September 1973|September 1973 election]] with his third wife [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel]] as vice-president. He [[expulsion of Montoneros from Plaza de Mayo|expelled Montoneros from the party]]{{sfn|Robben|2011|pp=76–77}} and they became once again a clandestine organization. [[José López Rega]] organized the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] (AAA) to fight against them and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP).
Perón died in July 1974 and was succeeded by his wife, who signed a secret decree empowering the military and the police to "annihilate" the left-wing subversion,{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=145}} [[Operation Independence|stopping ERP's attempt]] to start a rural insurgence in Tucumán province.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=148}} [[March 1976 coup|Isabel Perón was ousted]] one year later by a junta of the three armed forces, led by army general [[Jorge Rafael Videla]]. They initiated the [[National Reorganization Process]], often shortened to ''Proceso''.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=467–504}}

[[File:After war clean up Falklands 1982.jpg|thumb|Argentinian troops being made to clear their trash from the streets of Port Stanley after their surrender in 1982]]
The ''Proceso'' shut down Congress, removed the judges of the Supreme Court, banned political parties and unions, and resorted to the [[forced disappearance]] of suspected guerrilla members and of anyone believed to be associated with the left-wing. By the end of 1976 Montoneros had lost near 2,000 members; by 1977, the ERP was completely defeated. A severely weakened Montoneros launched a counterattack in 1979, which was quickly annihilated, ending the guerrilla threat. Nevertheless, the junta stayed in power.

In 1982, the then head of state, General [[Leopoldo Galtieri]], authorised the invasion of the British territories of South Georgia and, on 2 April, of the [[Operation Rosario|Falkland Islands]]. This led to the [[Falklands War]] with the United Kingdom and an Argentinian surrender on 14 June. Rioting on the streets of Buenos Aires followed the defeat and the military leadership responsible for the humiliation stood down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CBS News releases video of the Falklands War riots |url=https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/cbs-news-releases-video-of-the-falklands-war-riots |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=7 November 2018 |date=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reynaldo Bignone]] replaced Galtieri and began to organize the transition to democratic rule.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

===20th—21st centuries, Kirchner era===
{{main|Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|Kirchnerism}}
[[File:Cristina con baston de mando.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Photograph of Cristina Kirchner.|[[Cristina Fernández]] and [[Néstor Kirchner]] occupied the presidency of Argentina for 12 years, him from 2003 to 2007 and her from 2007 to 2015.]]
[[Raúl Alfonsín]] won the [[Argentine general election, 1983|1983 elections]] campaigning for the prosecution of those responsible for [[human rights]] violations during the ''Proceso'': the [[Trial of the Juntas]] and other martial courts sentenced all the coup's leaders but, under military pressure, he also enacted the [[Full Stop Law|Full Stop]] and [[Law of Due Obedience|Due Obedience]] laws,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Argentine law|l=23492|date=29 December 1986|bo=26058}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Argentine law|l=23521|date=9 June 1987|bo=26155}}&lt;/ref&gt; which halted prosecutions further down the [[chain of command]]. The worsening economic crisis and [[hyperinflation]] reduced his popular support and the Peronist [[Carlos Menem]] won the [[Argentine general election, 1989|1989 election]]. Soon after, [[1989 riots in Argentina|riots forced Alfonsín to an early resignation]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=533–549}}

Menem embraced [[neo-liberalism|neo-liberal]] policies:{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=6}} a [[Argentine Currency Board|fixed exchange rate]], business [[deregulation]], [[privatization]]s and dismantling of [[protectionism|protectionist]] barriers normalized the economy for a while. He pardoned the officers who had been sentenced during Alfonsín's government. The [[1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution|1994 Constitutional Amendment]] allowed Menem to [[Argentine general election, 1995|be elected for a second term]]. The economy began to decline in 1995, with increasing unemployment and recession;{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=9}} led by [[Fernando de la Rúa]], the UCR returned to the presidency in the [[Argentine general election, 1999|1999 elections]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

[[File:Presidente Macri en el Sillón de Rivadavia.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|alt=Photograph of Mauricio Macri|[[Mauricio Macri]], incumbent President of Argentina|alt=]]

De la Rúa kept Menem's economic plan despite the worsening crisis, which led to growing social discontent.{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=9}} A massive [[capital flight]] was responded to with a [[corralito|freezing of bank accounts]], generating further turmoil. The [[December 2001 riots in Argentina|December 2001 riots]] forced him to resign.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=575–587}} Congress appointed [[Eduardo Duhalde]] as acting president, who abrogated the fixed exchange rate established by Menem,{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=12}} causing many Argentinians to lose a significant portion of their savings.  By the late 2002 the economic crisis began to recede, but the assassination of two ''[[piquetero]]s'' by the police caused political commotion, prompting Duhalde to move elections forward.{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=13}} [[Néstor Kirchner]] was [[Argentine general election, 2003|elected as the new president]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

Boosting the [[neo-Keynesianism|neo-Keynesian]] economic policies{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=13}} laid by Duhalde, Kirchner ended the economic crisis attaining significant fiscal and trade surpluses, and steep GDP growth.{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=16}} Under his administration Argentina [[Argentine debt restructuring|restructured its defaulted debt]] with an unprecedented discount of about 70% on most bonds, paid off debts with the [[International Monetary Fund]],{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=15}} purged the military of officers with doubtful human rights records,{{sfn|Epstein|Pion-Berlin|2006|p=14}} [[void (law)|nullified and voided]] the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Argentine law|l=25779|date=3 September 2003|bo=30226|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|The Full Stop and Due Obedience laws had been abrogated by Congress in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Argentine law|l=24952|date=17 April 1998|bo=28879|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} ruled them as unconstitutional, and resumed legal prosecution of the Juntas' crimes. He did not run for reelection, promoting instead the candidacy of his wife, senator [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], who was [[Argentine general election, 2007|elected in 2007]]{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=597–626}} and [[Argentine general election, 2011|reelected in 2011]]. Fernández de Kirchner's administration oversaw a positive foreign policy with good relations with other South American nations; however, relations between the United States and United Kingdom remained heavily strained. [[Jorge Rafael Videla]], who had led the repression during the [[Dirty War]], was sentenced to life in a civilian prison in 2010 under de Kirchner's administration; he later died in prison in 2013.

On 22 November 2015, after a tie in the first round of [[Argentine general election, 2015|presidential elections on 25 October]], [[Mauricio Macri]] won the first [[Ballotage in Argentina|ballotage]] in Argentina's history, beating [[Front for Victory]] candidate [[Daniel Scioli]] and becoming president-elect.

The original pampa had virtually no trees; some imported species like the [[Platanus occidentalis|American sycamore]] or [[eucalyptus]] are present along roads or in towns and country estates (''estancias''). The only tree-like plant native to the pampa is the evergreen [[Ombú]]. The surface soils of the pampa are a deep black color, primarily [[mollisols]], known commonly as ''humus''. This makes the region one of the most agriculturally productive on Earth; however, this is also responsible for decimating much of the original ecosystem, to make way for commercial agriculture. The western pampas receive less rainfall, this ''dry pampa'' is a plain of short grasses or [[steppe]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold, all determined by the expanse across latitude, range in altitude, and relief features.&lt;ref name=arggov&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/paginas.dhtml?pagina=1483 |title=Geography and Climate of Argentina |publisher=Government of Argentina |accessdate=28 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220215355/http://www.argentina.gov.ar/argentina/portal/paginas.dhtml?pagina=1483 |archivedate=20 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the most populated areas are generally [[temperate climate|temperate]], Argentina has an exceptional amount of climate diversity,&lt;ref name = FAO&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/AGPC/doc/Counprof/Argentina/argentina.htm |title= Argentina |work= Country Pasture/Forage Resource Profiles |publisher= Food and Agriculture Organization |accessdate= 7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from [[subtropical]] in the north to [[Polar climate|polar]] in the far south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150830193152/http://www.turismo.gov.ar/eng/Information/fsinformations.htm |archivedate=30 August 2015 |url=http://www.turismo.gov.ar/eng/Information/fsinformations.htm |title=General Information |publisher=Ministerio de Turismo |accessdate=21 August 2015 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, there is a wide variety of [[biomes]] in the country, including subtropical rain forests, semi-arid and [[arid]] regions, temperate plains in the Pampas, and cold subantarctic in the south.&lt;ref name =Fernandez&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fernandez |first1=Osvaldo |last2=Busso |first2=Carlos |title=Arid and semi–arid rangelands: two thirds of Argentina |url=http://www.rala.is/rade/ralareport/fernandez.pdf |publisher=The Agricultural University of Iceland |accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|150|mm|in|0}} in the driest parts of [[Patagonia]] to over {{convert|2000|mm|in|0}} in the westernmost parts of Patagonia and the northeastern parts of the country.&lt;ref name = FAO/&gt; Mean annual temperatures range from {{convert|5|C|0}} in the far south to {{convert|25|C|0}} in the north.&lt;ref name=FAO/&gt;

Major wind currents include the cool [[Pampero Winds]] blowing on the flat plains of Patagonia and the Pampas; following the cold front, warm currents blow from the north in middle and late winter, creating mild conditions.{{sfn|Menutti|Menutti|1980|p=69}}
The [[Sudestada]] usually moderates cold temperatures but brings very heavy rains, rough seas and coastal flooding. It is most common in late autumn and winter along the central coast and in the Río de la Plata estuary.{{sfn|Menutti|Menutti|1980|p=69}}
The [[Zonda wind|Zonda]], a [[foehn wind|hot dry wind]], affects Cuyo and the central Pampas. Squeezed of all moisture during the {{convert|6000|m|0|abbr=on}} descent from the Andes, Zonda winds can blow for hours with gusts up to {{convert|120|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, fueling wildfires and causing damage; between June and November, when the Zonda blows, snowstorms and [[blizzard]] (''viento blanco'') conditions usually affect higher elevations.{{sfn|Menutti|Menutti|1980|p=53}}

[[File:Casa Rosada (8192119019).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.05|[[Casa Rosada]], workplace of the [[President of Argentina|President]]]]

Argentina is a [[Federalism|federal]] constitutional republic and [[representative democracy]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 1}} The government is regulated by a system of [[separation of powers|checks and balances]] defined by the [[Constitution of Argentina]], the country's supreme legal document. The [[seat of government]] is the city of [[Buenos Aires]], as designated by [[Argentine National Congress|Congress]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 3}} Suffrage is [[Universal suffrage|universal]], [[Equal suffrage|equal]], [[Secret ballot|secret]] and [[Compulsory voting|mandatory]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 37}}{{efn-ua|Since 2012 suffrage is optional for ages 16 and 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/11/01/argentina-voting-age/|title=Argentina lowers its voting age to 16|work=The Washington Post|place=Washington, D. C.|date=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The federal government is composed of three branches:

The [[Legislature|Legislative]] branch consists of the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] Congress, made up of the [[Argentine Senate|Senate]] and [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Deputy]] chambers, which makes [[federal law]], [[declaration of war|declares war]], approves [[treaty|treaties]] and has the [[power of the purse]] and of [[impeachment]], by which it can remove sitting members of the government.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 53, 59, 75}} The Chamber of Deputies represents the people and has 257 voting members elected to a four-year term. Seats are apportioned among the provinces by population every tenth year.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 45, 47, 50}} {{As of|2014}} ten provinces have just five deputies while the [[Buenos Aires Province]], being the most populous one, has 70. The Chamber of Senators represents the provinces, has 72 members elected [[at-large]] to six-year terms, with each province having three seats; one third of Senate seats are up for election every other year.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 54, 56}} At least one-third of the candidates presented by the parties must be women.
In the [[Executive (government)|Executive]] branch, the [[President of Argentina|President]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the military, can [[veto]] [[bill (law)|legislative bills]] before they become law—subject to Congressional override—and appoints the [[Cabinet of Argentina|members of the Cabinet]] and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 99}} The President is elected [[direct vote|directly]] by the vote of the people, serves a four-year term and may be elected to office no more than twice in a row.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 90}}

The [[Judiciary|Judicial]] branch includes the [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Supreme Court]] and lower [[Law of Argentina|federal courts]] interpret laws and [[judicial review|overturn those]] they find [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]].{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 116}} The Judicial is independent of the Executive and the Legislative. The Supreme Court has seven members appointed by the President—subject to Senate approval—who serve for life. The lower courts' judges are proposed by the [[Council of Magistrates of the Nation|Council of Magistrates]] (a secretariat composed of representatives of judges, lawyers, researchers, the Executive and the Legislative), and appointed by the President on Senate approval.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 99, 114}}

===Provinces===
{{main|Provinces of Argentina}}
{{see also|List of Argentine provinces by population}}
{{Argentina imagemap with province names|float=right|size=300px}}
Argentina is a federation of twenty-three provinces and one [[autonomous city]], Buenos Aires. Provinces are divided for administration purposes into [[Departments of Argentina|departments]] and [[Municipalities of Argentina|municipalities]], except for Buenos Aires Province, which is divided into [[Partidos of Buenos Aires|partidos]]. The City of Buenos Aires is divided into [[Barrios and Communes of Buenos Aires|communes]].

Provinces hold all the power that they chose not to delegate to the federal government;{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 121}} they must be representative republics and must not contradict the Constitution.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 5–6}} Beyond this they are fully autonomous: they enact their own constitutions,{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 123}} freely organize their local governments,{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 122}} and own and manage their natural and financial resources.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=arts. 124–125}} Some provinces have bicameral legislatures, while others have [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] ones.{{efn-ua|Although not a province, the [[City of Buenos Aires]] is a federally [[autonomous city]], and as such its local organization has similarities with provinces: it has its own constitution, an elected mayor and representatives to the Senate and Deputy chambers.{{sfn|Constitution of Argentina|loc=art. 129}} As [[federal capital]] of the nation it holds the status of [[federal district]].}}

During the War of Independence the main cities and their surrounding countrysides became provinces though the intervention of their [[cabildo (council)|cabildos]]. The Anarchy of the Year XX completed this process, shaping the original thirteen provinces. Jujuy seceded from [[Salta Province|Salta]] in 1834, and the thirteen provinces became fourteen.
After seceding for a decade, Buenos Aires accepted the 1853 Constitution of Argentina in 1861, and was made a federal territory in 1880.{{sfn|Rey Balmaceda|1995|p=19}}

An 1862 law designated as [[national territory|national territories]] those under federal control but outside the frontiers of the provinces. In 1884 they served as bases for the establishment of the [[governorate]]s of Misiones, Formosa, Chaco, La Pampa, Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego.{{sfn|Rock|1987|p=155}}
The agreement about a frontier dispute with Chile in 1900 created the [[National Territory of Los Andes]]; its lands were incorporated into Jujuy, Salta and [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]] in 1943.{{sfn|Rey Balmaceda|1995|p=19}} [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]] and Chaco became provinces in 1951. Misiones did so in 1953, and [[Formosa Province|Formosa]], [[Neuquén Province|Neuquén]], [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]], [[Chubut Province|Chubut]] and Santa Cruz, in 1955. The last national territory, Tierra del Fuego, became the [[Tierra del Fuego, Antártida e Islas del Atlántico Sur Province]] in 1990.{{sfn|Rey Balmaceda|1995|p=19}}

Argentinians have received three [[Nobel Prize]]s in the Sciences. [[Bernardo Houssay]], the first Latin American recipient, discovered the role of [[pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] in regulating [[glucose]] in animals, and shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1947. [[Luis Leloir]] discovered how organisms store energy converting glucose into [[glycogen]] and the compounds which are fundamental in [[metabolism|metabolizing]] [[carbohydrate]]s, receiving the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1970. [[César Milstein]] did extensive research in [[antibody|antibodies]], sharing the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984. Argentine research has led to treatments for [[heart disease]]s and several forms of cancer. [[Domingo Liotta]] designed and developed the first [[artificial heart]] that was successfully implanted in a human being in 1969. [[René Favaloro]] developed the techniques and performed the world's first [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary bypass surgery]].

Argentina's nuclear programme has been highly successful. In 1957 Argentina was the first country in Latin America to design and build a [[research reactor]] with homegrown technology, the [[RA-1 Enrico Fermi]]. This reliance in the development of own nuclear related technologies, instead of simply buying them abroad, was a constant of Argentina's nuclear programme conducted by the civilian [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] (CNEA). Nuclear facilities with Argentine technology have been built in Peru, Algeria, Australia and Egypt. In 1983, the country admitted having the capability of producing weapon-grade [[uranium]], a major step needed to assemble [[nuclear weapon]]s; since then, however, Argentina has pledged to use nuclear power only for peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://carnegieendowment.org/2009/01/08/brazil-and-argentina-s-nuclear-cooperation/3jqa|title= Brazil and Argentina's Nuclear Cooperation|author= Argüello, Irma |date= 8 January 2009|publisher= Carnegie Endowment for international peace}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the Board of Governors of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], Argentina has been a strong voice in support of nuclear non-proliferation efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26516.htm |title=Background Note: Argentina |publisher=State.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is highly committed to global nuclear security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/04/140130.htm |title=Hillary Clinton: Argentina is on the forefront of the fight for nuclear security |publisher=State.gov |date=13 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416054220/http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/04/140130.htm |archivedate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 it was the first country in Latin America to put in-line a commercial nuclear power plant, [[Atucha I Nuclear Power Plant|Atucha I]].

Despite its modest budget and numerous setbacks, academics and the sciences in Argentina have enjoyed an international respect since the turn of the 1900s, when Dr. [[Luis Agote]] devised the first safe and effective means of [[blood transfusion]] as well as [[René Favaloro]], who was a pioneer in the improvement of the [[coronary artery bypass surgery]]. Argentine scientists are still on the cutting edge in fields such as [[nanotechnology]], [[physics]], [[computer science]]s, molecular biology, oncology, ecology and cardiology.

Population density is of 15 persons per square kilometer of land area, well below the world average of 50 persons. The population growth rate in 2010 was an estimated 1.03% annually, with a birth rate of 17.7 live births per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 7.4 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants. The [[net migration rate]] has ranged from zero to four immigrants per 1,000 inhabitants per year.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The proportion of people under 15 is 25.6%, a little below the world average of 28%, and the proportion of people 65 and older is relatively high at 10.8%. In Latin America this is second only to [[Uruguay]] and well above the world average, which is currently 7%. Argentina has one of Latin America's lowest [[population growth rate]]s, recently about 1% a year, as well as a comparatively low [[infant mortality rate]]. Its birth rate of 2.3 children per woman is still nearly twice as high as that in Spain or Italy, compared here as they have similar religious practices and proportions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/pdf09/09wpds_eng.pdf |title=PRB |format=PDF | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100422034436/http://www.prb.org/pdf09/09wpds_eng.pdf| archivedate= 22 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''UN Demographic Yearbook, 2007.''&lt;/ref&gt; The median age is approximately 30 years and [[life expectancy]] at birth is 77.14 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nee|first=Patrick W.|title=Key Facts on Argentina: Essential Information on Argentina|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PysOnrdZJXgC&amp;pg=PT10|year=2015|publisher=The Internationalist|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1857 and 1950 Argentina was the country with the second biggest immigration wave in the world, with 6.6 million, second only to the United States in the numbers of immigrants received (27 million) and ahead of such other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cels.org.ar/Site_cels/publicaciones/informes_pdf/1998.Capitulo7.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=10 June 2007|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=3 December 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610215422/http://www.cels.org.ar/Site_cels/publicaciones/informes_pdf/1998.Capitulo7.pdf|archivedate=10 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docentes.fe.unl.pt/~satpeg/PapersInova/Labor+and+Immigration+in+LA-2005.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=14 August 2011|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=3 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814202421/http://docentes.fe.unl.pt/~satpeg/PapersInova/Labor%20and%20Immigration%20in%20LA-2005.pdf|archivedate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strikingly, at those times, the national population doubled every two decades. This belief is endured in the popular saying ''"los argentinos descienden de los barcos"'' (Argentines descend from the ships). Therefore, most Argentines are descended from the 19th- and 20th-century immigrants of the [[Immigration to Argentina|great immigration wave to Argentina]] (1850–1955),&lt;ref name="Lizcano"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LcabJ98-t1wC&amp;pg=PA93|title=Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXI|isbn=978-970-757-052-8|author=Fernández, Francisco Lizcano|year=2007|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=statesmen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Argentina.html|title=Argentina|publisher=World Statesmen.org|author=Cahoon, Ben }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a great majority of these immigrants coming from diverse European countries.

Argentina is home to a significant population of [[Arab Argentine|Arab]] and partial Arab background, mostly of [[Syrian people|Syrian]] and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] origin (in Argentina they are considered among the [[white people]], just like in the United States Census). The majority of [[Arab Argentines]] are [[Christians]] who belong to the [[Maronite Church]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Churches|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches]].

The country is the largest [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking society]] that universally employs ''[[voseo]]'', the use of the [[pronoun]] ''vos'' instead of ''tú'' ("you"), which imposes the use of alternative verb forms as well.
Due to the extensive Argentine geography, Spanish has a strong variation among regions, although the prevalent dialect is ''[[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatense]]'', primarily spoken in the La Plata Basin and accented similarly to the [[Neapolitan language]].{{sfn|Colantoni|Gurlekian|2004|pp=107–119}} Italian and other European immigrants influenced ''[[Lunfardo]]''—the regional slang—permeating the vernacular vocabulary of other Latin American countries as well.

Argentina is a [[multiculturalism|multicultural country]] with significant European influences. Modern Argentine culture has been largely influenced by [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and other European immigration from France, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|United Kingdom]], and Germany among others. Its cities are largely characterized by both the prevalence of people of European descent, and of conscious imitation of American and European styles in fashion, architecture and design.&lt;ref name=frommer&gt;Luongo, Michael. ''Frommer's Argentina''. Wiley Publishing, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Museums, cinemas, and galleries are abundant in all the large urban centers, as well as traditional establishments such as literary bars, or bars offering [[live music]] of a variety of genres although there are lesser elements of [[Amerindian]] and [[African culture|African]] influences, particularly in the fields of music and art. {{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=91}} The other big influence is the [[gaucho]]s and their traditional country lifestyle of self-reliance.{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=123}} Finally, indigenous American traditions have been absorbed into the general cultural milieu.
Argentine writer [[Ernesto Sabato]] has reflected on the nature of the culture of Argentina as follows:
{{quote|With the primitive Hispanic American reality fractured in La Plata Basin due to immigration, its inhabitants have come to be somewhat dual with all the dangers but also with all the advantages of that condition: because of our European roots, we deeply link the nation with the enduring values of the Old World; because of our condition of Americans we link ourselves to the rest of the continent, through the folklore of the interior and the old Castilian that unifies us, feeling somehow the vocation of the ''Patria Grande'' San Martín and Bolívar once imagined.

Although Argentina's rich literary history began around 1550,{{sfn|Rivas|1989|p=11}} it reached full independence with [[Esteban Echeverría]]'s ''El Matadero'', a [[Romantic literature|romantic]] landmark that played a significant role in the development of 19th century's Argentine narrative,{{sfn|Foster|Lockhart|Lockhart|1998|p=99}} split by the ideological divide between the popular, federalist epic of [[José Hernández (writer)|José Hernández]]' ''[[Martín Fierro]]'' and the elitist and cultured discourse of [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Sarmiento]]'s masterpiece, ''[[Facundo]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Foster|1a2=Lockhart|1a3=Lockhart|1y=1998|1pp=13, 101|2a1=Young|2a2=Cisneros|2y=2010|2p=51}}

The [[Modernist literature|Modernist]] movement advanced into the 20th century including exponents such as [[Leopoldo Lugones]] and poet [[Alfonsina Storni]];{{sfn|Young|Cisneros|2010|pp=51–52}} it was followed by [[Vanguardism]], with [[Ricardo Güiraldes]]'s ''[[Don Segundo Sombra]]'' as an important reference.{{sfnm|1a1=Foster|1a2=Lockhart|1a3=Lockhart|1y=1998|1pp=104, 107–109|2a1=Young|2a2=Cisneros|2y=2010|2p=223}}

[[Jorge Luis Borges]], Argentina's most acclaimed writer and one of the foremost figures in the [[history of literature]],{{sfn|Bloom|1994|p=2}} found new ways of looking at the modern world in [[metaphor]] and philosophical debate and his influence has extended to authors all over the globe.

After 1955, virtuoso [[Astor Piazzolla]] popularized ''[[Nuevo tango]]'', a subtler and more intellectual trend for the genre.{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=43}}
Tango enjoys worldwide popularity nowadays with groups like [[Gotan Project]], [[Bajofondo]] and [[Tanghetto]].

A national Argentine folk style emerged in the 1930s from dozens of regional musical genres and went to influence the entirety of [[Latin American music]]. Some of its interpreters, like [[Atahualpa Yupanqui]] and [[Mercedes Sosa]], achieved worldwide acclaim.

The [[romantic ballad]] genre included singers of international fame such as [[Sandro de América]].

[[Argentine rock]] developed as a distinct musical style in the mid-1960s, when Buenos Aires and Rosario became cradles of aspiring musicians.
Founding bands like [[Los Gatos]], [[Sui Generis]], [[Almendra (band)|Almendra]] and [[Manal]] were followed by [[Seru Giran]], [[Los Abuelos de la Nada]], [[Soda Stereo]] and [[Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota]], with prominent artists including [[Gustavo Cerati]], [[Litto Nebbia]], [[Andrés Calamaro]], [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]], [[Charly García]], [[Fito Páez]] and [[León Gieco]].{{sfn|McCloskey|Burford|2006|p=43}}

[[Tenor saxophone|Tenor saxophonist]] [[Gato Barbieri|Leandro "Gato" Barbieri]] and composer and [[big band]] conductor [[Lalo Schifrin]] are among the most internationally successful Argentine jazz musicians.

Argentine theatre traces its origins to Viceroy [[Juan José de Vértiz y Salcedo]]'s creation of the colony's first theatre, ''La Ranchería'', in 1783. In this stage, in 1786, a tragedy entitled ''Siripo'' had its premiere. ''Siripo'' is now a lost work (only the second act is conserved), and can be considered the first Argentine stage play, because it was written by Buenos Aires poet Manuel José de Lavardén, it was premiered in Buenos Aires, and its plot was inspired by an historical episode of the early colonization of the [[Río de la Plata Basin]]: the destruction of [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Sancti Spiritu]] colony by aboriginals in 1529. ''La Ranchería'' theatre operated until its destruction in a fire in 1792. The second theatre stage in Buenos Aires was [[Teatro Coliseo]], opened in 1804 during the term of Viceroy [[Rafael de Sobremonte]]. It was the nation's longest-continuously operating stage. The musical creator of the Argentine National Anthem, [[Blas Parera]], earned fame as a theatre score writer during the early 19th century. The genre suffered during the regime of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], though it flourished alongside the economy later in the century. The national government gave Argentine theatre its initial impulse with the establishment of the [[Colón Theatre]], in 1857, which hosted classical and operatic, as well as stage performances. Antonio Petalardo's successful 1871 gambit on the opening of the [[Teatro Opera]], inspired others to fund the growing art in Argentina.

Some of the best-known Argentine painters are [[Cándido López]] and [[Florencio Molina Campos]] ([[Naïve art|Naïve style]]); [[Ernesto de la Cárcova]] and [[Eduardo Sívori]] ([[Realism (art)|Realism]]); [[Fernando Fader]] ([[Impressionism]]); [[Pío Collivadino]], [[Atilio Malinverno]] and [[Cesáreo Bernaldo de Quirós]] ([[Postimpressionism]]); [[Emilio Pettoruti]] ([[Cubism]]); [[Julio Barragán]] ([[Concretism (art)|Concretism]] and Cubism) [[Antonio Berni]] ([[Neofigurativism]]); [[Roberto Aizenberg]] and [[Xul Solar]] ([[Surrealism]]); [[Gyula Košice]] ([[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]]); [[Eduardo Mac Entyre]] ([[Generative art]]); [[Luis Seoane]], ''Carlos Torrallardona'', ''Luis Aquino'', and ''Alfredo Gramajo Gutiérrez'' ([[Modernism]]); [[Lucio Fontana]] ([[Spatialism]]); [[Tomás Maldonado]] and [[Guillermo Kuitca]] ([[Abstract art]]); [[León Ferrari]] and [[Marta Minujín]] ([[Conceptual art]]); and [[Gustavo Cabral]] ([[Fantasy art]]).

In 1946 Gyula Košice and others created The [[Madí Movement]] in Argentina, which then spread to Europe and United States, where it had a significant impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Jennifer|title=Lively, playful geometric works of art for fun|work=St. Petersburg Times|place=St. Petersburg, FL|date=16 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tomás Maldonado was one of the main theorists of the [[Ulm School of Design|Ulm Model]] of design education, still highly influential globally.

Other Argentine artists of worldwide fame include [[Adolfo Bellocq]], whose [[lithograph]]s have been influential since the 1920s, and [[Benito Quinquela Martín]], the quintessential port painter, inspired by the immigrant-bound [[La Boca]] neighborhood.

Internationally laureate sculptors [[Erminio Blotta]], [[Lola Mora]] and [[Rogelio Yrurtia]] authored many of the classical evocative monuments of the Argentine cityscape.

The city's characteristic convergence of diverse architectural styles can be seen, including [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish Colonial]], [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]], and [[modernist architecture]].]]
The colonization brought the [[Spanish Baroque architecture]], which can still be appreciated in its simpler ''Rioplatense'' style in the [[Indian Reductions|reduction]] of [[San Ignacio Miní]], the [[Cathedral of Córdoba (Argentina)|Cathedral of Córdoba]], and the Cabildo of Luján. Italian and French influences increased at the beginning of the 19th century with strong [[Eclectic architecture|eclectic]] overtones that gave the local architecture a unique feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20130226-preserving-history-in-buenos-aires|title=Preserving history in Buenos Aires|last=Martínez-Carter|first=Karina|publisher=BBC Travel|date=14 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123055257/http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20130226-preserving-history-in-buenos-aires|archivedate=23 January 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous Argentine architects have enriched their own country's cityscape and those around the world: [[Juan Antonio Buschiazzo]] helped popularize [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] and [[Francisco Gianotti]] combined [[Art Nouveau]] with [[Italianate]] styles, each adding flair to Argentine cities during the early 20th century. [[Francisco Salamone]] and [[Viktor Sulčič]] left an [[Art Deco]] legacy, and [[Alejandro Bustillo]] created a prolific body of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[Rationalist architecture]]. [[Alberto Prebisch]] and [[Amancio Williams]] were highly influenced by [[Le Corbusier]], while [[Clorindo Testa]] introduced [[Brutalist architecture]] locally. [[César Pelli]]'s and [[Patricio Pouchulu]]'s [[Futurist architecture|Futurist]] creations have graced cities worldwide: Pelli's 1980s throwbacks to the Art Deco glory of the 1920s made him one of the world's most prestigious architects, with the [[Norwest Center]] and the [[Petronas Towers]] among his most celebrated creations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6972">The '''Asian Coalition for Housing Rights''' (ACHR) is a network of [[community organisation]]s in [[Asia]] working on issues related to urban [[poverty]], [[slum]]s and [[slum upgrading]]. It champions low-income and other marginalised groups living in cities as experts on urban poverty, and as actors capable of contributing to urban development. 

== Aims and practices ==

ACHR focuses on supporting the establishment and development of grassroots organisations of the urban poor, who can effectively advocate on housing and land reform. These organisations are typically formed around neighbourhood-level savings groups. ACHR equips these organisations with technical support, such as architects and urban planners who can help the urban poor to map their living conditions and draw up comprehensive site plans for upgrading or relocation projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archer D, Luansang C, Boonmahathanakorn S|first=|year=2012|title=Facilitating community mapping and planning for citywide upgrading: the role of community architects|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956247812437132|journal=Environment and Urbanization|volume=24 |issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities will typically combine their savings in city development funds (CDFs), which allow them to leverage public finance from national and local governments, or even by international donors. This allows communities to take on much  larger development projects.

By linking residents of informal settlements at the settlement, city, country and regional scale, ACHR provides a channel for the urban poor to influence policy and programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burris S, Hancock T, Lin V, Herzog  A.|first=|year=2007|title=Emerging Strategies for Healthy Urban Governance|url=|journal=Journal of Urban Health|volume=84 |issue=1|pages=154–163|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Thailand, for example, ACHR has helped low-income communities to negotiate land sharing or land leasing arrangements with local authorities and private landowners, and then to access low-cost housing loans and infrastructure subsidies to upgrade their neighbourhoods. The aim is to help landowners capture the commercial value of their land while reducing urban poverty and vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shand|first1=Wayne|title=Financing the inclusive city: the catalytic role of community savings|journal=Environment and Urbanization|date=2018|volume=30|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0956247817751340|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956247817751340}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

ACHR's emphasis on community finance should be distinguished from microfinance. Local groups collectively decide together how to use their savings to meet both public and private aims. The collective financial capital strengthens the group’s social capital, and the two grow together. This collective aspect is not present in microfinance, where the emphasis is on individual access to credit and loan repayment, not on achieving collective priorities or addressing the structural issues that cause poverty and exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boonyabancha|first1=Somsook|title=Making people the subject: community-managed finance systems in five Asian countries|journal=Environment and Urbanization|date=2018|volume=30|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0956247817751335|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956247817751335}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACHR has financed exchanges among informal settlements, cities and countries to allow the urban poor to share success stories and lessons learned across Asian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D’Cruz C, Satterthwaite D.|first=|year=2006|title=The role of urban grassroots organizations and their national federations in reducing poverty and achieving the millennium development goals.|url=|journal=Global Urban Development|volume=2 |issue=1|pages=1–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows successful innovations to be replicated, including city development funds.

== Asian Coalition for Community Action ==

Central to ACHR's work over recent years has been the Asian Coalition for Community Action (ACCA), a fund supporting local organisations through professional exchanges and grants/loans in 165 cities and 19 Asian countries. The ACCA programme enabled the expansion and evolution of savings processes, so that local groups were able to offer more sophisticated financial products: longer-term savings for housing, interest-earning savings accounts, insurance/welfare schemes and loans for both individual livelihoods and community enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boonyabancha|first1=Somsook|title=Making people the subject: community-managed finance systems in five Asian countries|journal=Environment and Urbanization|date=2018|volume=30|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0956247817751335|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956247817751335}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In most countries, the ACCA savings process began with informal groups. However, more formal structures have been developed in many places. In Thailand, the savings groups have had to register as housing cooperatives, while in the Philippines, the savings groups have had to register as homeowners' associations or community associations. In Cambodia, the movement remains unregulated. In all cases, savings networks have sought to collaborate with multiple levels of government to influence land use zoning, service provision and building codes, as well as to negotiate access to land and subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boonyabancha|first1=Somsook|title=Making people the subject: community-managed finance systems in five Asian countries|journal=Environment and Urbanization|date=2018|volume=30|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0956247817751335|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956247817751335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==

ACHR was established in 1989. The Secretariat is based in Bangkok. The Secretary General is Somsook Boonyabancha, who was formerly Director of the Community Organizations Development Institute (CODI) in Thailand. ACHR has close ties with the [[Slum Dwellers International]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.achr.net/about_achr.htm About ACHR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802005456/http://www.achr.net/about_achr.htm|date=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; having supported SDI to initiate saving schemes, form local slum federations and establish dialogues with municipal and national governments on issues such as sanitation, water and relocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patel S, Burra C, D’Cruz C|first=|year=2001|title=Slum/Shack Dwellers International (SDI) - foundations to treetops|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/095624780101300204|journal=Environment and Urbanization|volume=13 |issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Industrial panorama in Irkutsk, Russia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Irkutsk]] is the biggest city in the region around [[Lake Baikal]]]]

'''Baikalia''' (or Baykalia) is a vague geographical term referring to the region around [[Lake Baikal]]. It is less common than the concept of [[Transbaikalia]], the area to the east of Lake Baikal. The term Baikalia is loosely defined and has no official definition.

The Baikal area has a long history of human habitation. An early known tribe in the area was the [[Kurykans]], forefathers of two ethnic groups: the [[Buryats]] and the [[Yakuts]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Located in the former northern territory of the [[Xiongnu]] confederation, Baikalia was a theatre of the [[Han–Xiongnu War]], where the armies of the [[Han dynasty]] pursued and defeated the Xiongnu forces from the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD. They recorded that the lake was a "huge sea" (''hanhai'') and designated it the North Sea (''Běihǎi'') of the semimythical [[Four Seas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Chun-shu|last=Chang|title=The Rise of the Chinese Empire: Nation, State, and Imperialism in Early China, ca. 1600 B.C.-A.D. 8|year=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-11533-4|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kurykans, a Siberian tribe who inhabited the area in the sixth century, gave it a name that translates to "much water". Later on, it was called "natural lake" (''Baygal nuur'') by the [[Buryats]] and "rich lake" (''Bay göl'') by the [[Yakuts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=W. Bruce|last=Lincoln|title=The Conquest of a Continent: Siberia and the Russians|year=2007|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8922-8|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little was known to Europeans about the lake until Russia expanded into the area in the 17th century. The first [[Russian explorers|Russian explorer]] to reach Lake Baikal was [[Kurbat Ivanov]] in 1643.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irkutsk.org/baikal/research.htm |title=Research of the Baikal |publisher=Irkutsk.org |date=18 January 2006 |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian expansion into the Buryat area around Lake Baikal&lt;ref&gt;George V. Lantzeff and Richard A. Price, 'Eastward to Empire',1973&lt;/ref&gt; in 1628–58 was part of the [[Russian conquest of Siberia]]. It was done first by following the Angara River upstream from [[Yeniseysk]] (founded 1619) and later by moving south from the Lena River. Russians first heard of the Buryats in 1609 at [[Tomsk]]. According to folktales related a century after the fact, in 1623, [[Demid Pyanda]], who may have been the first Russian to reach the Lena, crossed from the upper Lena to the Angara and arrived at Yeniseysk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randewy.ru/karta/geogr24.html |script-title=ru:Открытие Русскими Средней И Восточной Сибири |publisher=Randewy.ru |accessdate=2012-01-02|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vikhor Savin (1624) and [[Maksim Perfilyev]] (1626 and 1627–28) explored [[Evenks|Tungus]] country on the lower Angara. To the west, [[Krasnoyarsk]] on the upper Yenisei was founded in 1627. A number of ill-documented expeditions explored eastward from Krasnoyarsk. In 1628, [[Pyotr Beketov]] first encountered a group of Buryats and collected ''[[yasak]]'' ([[tribute]]) from them at the future site of [[Bratsk]]. In 1629, Yakov Khripunov set off from Tomsk to find a rumored silver mine. His men soon began plundering both Russians and natives. They were joined by another band of rioters from Krasnoyarsk, but left the Buryat country when they ran short of food. This made it difficult for other Russians to enter the area. In 1631, Maksim Perfilyev built an ''[[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]]'' at Bratsk. The pacification was moderately successful, but in 1634, Bratsk was destroyed and its garrison killed.  In 1635, Bratsk was restored by a punitive expedition under Radukovskii. In 1638, it was besieged unsuccessfully.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1638, Perfilyev crossed from the Angara over the Ilim portage to the [[Lena River]] and went downstream as far as [[Olyokminsk]]. Returning, he sailed up the [[Vitim River]] into the area east of Lake Baikal (1640) where he heard reports of the Amur country. In 1641, Verkholensk was founded on the upper Lena. In 1643, [[Kurbat Ivanov]] went further up the Lena and became the first Russian to see Lake Baikal and [[Olkhon Island]]. Half his party under Skorokhodov remained on the lake, reached the [[Upper Angara]] at its northern tip, and wintered on the [[Barguzin River]] on the northeast side.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1644, Ivan Pokhabov went up the Angara to Baikal, becoming perhaps the first Russian to use this route, which is difficult because of the rapids. He crossed the lake and explored the lower [[Selenge River]]. About 1647, he repeated the trip, obtained guides, and visited a 'Tsetsen Khan' near [[Ulan Bator]]. In 1648, Ivan Galkin built an ''ostrog ''on the Barguzin River which became a center for eastward expansion. In 1652, Vasily Kolesnikov reported from Barguzin that one could reach the Amur country by following the Selenga, Uda, and Khilok Rivers to the future sites of [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]] and [[Nerchinsk]]. In 1653, [[Pyotr Beketov]] took Kolesnikov's route to Lake Irgen west of Chita, and that winter his man Urasov founded Nerchinsk. Next spring, he tried to occupy Nerchensk, but was forced by his men to join [[Russian-Manchu border conflicts|Stephanov]] on the Amur.

The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] was built between 1896 and 1902. Construction of the [[Circum-Baikal Railway|scenic railway around the southwestern end of Lake Baikal]] required 200 bridges and 33 tunnels.  Until its completion, a [[train ferry]] transported railcars across the lake from [[Port Baikal]] to [[Mysovaya]] for a number of years. The lake became the site of the minor [[Battle of Lake Baikal|engagement]] between the [[Czechoslovak legion]] and the [[Red Army]] in 1918. At times during winter freezes, the lake could be crossed on foot—though at risk of frostbite and deadly hypothermia from the cold wind moving unobstructed across flat expanses of ice.  In the winter of 1920, the [[Great Siberian Ice March]] occurred, when the retreating White Russian Army crossed frozen Lake Baikal. The wind on the exposed lake was so cold, many people died, freezing in place until spring thaw. Beginning in 1956, the impounding of the [[Irkutsk Dam]] on the Angara River raised the level of the lake by {{Convert|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="his"&gt;{{cite web|title=Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station History |url=http://en.irkutskenergo.ru/qa/1008.2.html|publisher=Irkutskenergo|accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Braničevo''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Браничево, {{IPA-sh|brǎnitʃɛʋɔ|pron}}) is a geographical region in east-central [[Serbia]]. It is mostly situated in the [[Braničevo District]].

==History==
[[File:Map of the Despotate of Stefan Lazarevic 1422.svg|thumbnail|Town of Braničevo in the Serbian Despotate in 1422.]]
In the 9th century, a Slavic (Serb&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=_XGmUZ-zDYGp7Aax1IDwBQ&amp;hl=en&amp;id=-YMMAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=srpsko+pleme+brani%C4%8Devci&amp;q=%22oba+srpska+plemena%2C+Brani%C4%8Devci+i+Timo-+%C4%8Dani%22#search_anchor]&lt;/ref&gt;) tribe known as [[Braničevci]] are mentioned living in the region. In this time, the town named [[Braničevo (town)|Braničevo]] also existed in the area, at the estuary of the river [[Mlava]] into [[Danube]]. In the Early Middle Ages, Braničevo became a part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. After the conquest of Bulgaria, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] established the [[Theme of Sirmium]] in the wider region south of the river [[Danube]]. Syrmia, and hence Braničevo, came to be contested between [[Kingdom of Hungary]] on the one side, and the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] (after its independence from the Byzantines) on the other. In the 13th century the Hungarians established the [[Banate of Braničevo]] (Banovina of Braničevo), but later in the century two local Bulgarian rulers, [[Darman and Kudelin]], became independent and ruled over Braničevo and [[Kučevo]]. In 1291, they were defeated by the [[Serbs|Serbian]] king, [[Stefan Dragutin]], who joined Braničevo to his [[Kingdom of Syrmia|Syrmian Kingdom]]. Under his rule the town of Braničevo became a seat of the [[Eparchy]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=Fine&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine|first=John V.A.|title=The Late Medieval Balkans: a critical survey from the late twelfth century to the Ottoman conquest|year=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472082605|page=261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvVbRrH1QBgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region later belonged to subsequent Serbian states, until it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th century. In the 14th century, the region was in a possession of local rulers from the [[House of Rastislalić]]. During the Ottoman rule, Braničevo was part of the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]], and since 19th century, it is again part of the [[Serbia]]n state.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8236">'''Cadastral surveying''' is the sub-field of [[cadastre]] and [[surveying]] that specialises in the establishment and re-establishment of [[Real estate|real property]] boundaries. It is an important component of the legal creation of properties. A cadastral surveyor must apply both the spatial-measurement principles of general surveying and legal principles such as respect of neighboring titles.

==Duties and role of a cadastral surveyor==
[[File:-BLMcareers (21857337562).jpg|thumb|right|290px|Cadastral surveyors in Alaska]]

One of the primary roles of the land surveyor is to determine the boundary of real property on the ground. That boundary has already been established and described in legal documents and official plans and maps prepared by attorneys, engineers, and other land surveyors.  The corners of the property will either have been monumented by a prior surveyor, or monumented by the surveyor hired to perform a survey of a new boundary which has been agreed upon by adjoining land owners.

===Principles of cadastral surveying===
A common use of a survey is to determine a legal property boundary. The first stage in such a survey, known as a resurvey, is to obtain copies of the deed description and all other available documents from the owner. The deed description is that of the deed and not a tax statement or other incomplete document. The surveyor should then obtain copies of deed descriptions and maps of the adjoining properties, any records from the municipality or county, utility maps, and any records of surveys. Depending on which region the survey is located in, some or most of this information may not be available or even exist. Whether the information exists or not, a thorough search should be conducted so that no records are overlooked. Copies of deeds usually can be located in the government recorder's office, and maps or [[plat]]s can usually be found at the recorder or surveyor's office. These arrangements will vary state-to-state and survey-system-to-survey system, so some familiarity may be needed.

When all the records are assembled, the surveyor examines the documents for errors, such as closure errors. When a [[metes and bounds]] description is involved, the seniority of the deeds must be determined. The title abstract usually gives the order of seniority for the deeds related to the tract being surveyed and should be used if available. After this data is gathered and analyzed the field survey may commence. The initial survey operations should be concentrated on locating monuments. In urban regions, monuments should be sought initially; but in the absence of monuments, property corners marked by iron pins, metal survey markers, iron pipes, and other features possibly establishing a line of possession should be located. When the approximate positions for the boundaries of the property have been located, a traverse is run around the property. While the control traverse is being run, ties should be measured and all details relevant to the boundaries should be acquired. This includes but is not limited to locating the property corners, monuments, fences, hedge rows, walls, walks, and all buildings on the lot. The surveyor then takes this collected data and compares it to the records which were received. When a solution is reached, the chosen property corners (those that best fit all the data) are coordinated, and ties by direction and distance are computed from the nearest traverse point. Once this has been established the features on the lot can be drawn, dimensions can be shown from these features to the boundary line, and a map or plat is prepared for the client.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J., &amp; Mikhail, E. (1998). Surveying: Theory and practice. (7th ed., p. 1011). McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monuments===
[[File:Yellowstone 1871b.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[F.V. Hayden]]'s map of [[Yellowstone National Park]], 1871. His surveys were a significant basis for establishing the park in 1872.]]
[[File:SurveyCottonSpindleSpike1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A cotton spindle spike in [[Tel Aviv]] pavement, used as a marker for public area cadastral surveying.]]
Monuments are categorized into two groups which are known as natural and artificial. Natural monuments are things such as trees, large stones, and other substantial, naturally occurring objects that were in place before the survey was made. An artificial monument is anything within the regulations which marks the property boundary &amp;ndash; having been placed by landowners, surveyors, engineers, or others. They may be referred to as iron pins or pipes, stakes, trees, concrete monuments, or whatever the surveyor decides to use at the time, within the regulations for the area. The courts have held that natural monuments take precedence over artificial monuments, because they are more certain in identification and less likely to be disturbed.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, C., Wilson, D., &amp; Robillard, W. (2003). Brown's boundary control and legal principles. (5th ed., p. 30). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, construction and maintenance of roads and many other human acts, along with acts of nature such as earthquakes, movement of water, and [[Tectonics|tectonic]] shift can obliterate or damage the monumented locations of land boundaries. The land surveyor is often compelled to consider other evidence such as fence locations, wood lines, monuments on neighboring properties, and people's recollections. This other evidence is known as extrinsic evidence and is a fairly common principle. Extrinsic evidence is defined as evidence outside the writings, in this case evidence outside of the deed. Extrinsic evidence is held to be of equal value to evidence from another source.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, D., &amp; Hermansen, K. (1995). Use of extrinsic evidence to aid interpretation of deeds. Journal of Surveying Engineering, (121), 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's land surveyor sets monuments at actual physical points on the ground that define angle points of boundary lines dividing neighboring land parcels. These monuments are most often 1/2" or 5/8" iron [[rebar]] rods or pipes placed at 18" minimum depth, but they vary from state by state. The more recent rods or pipes may have an affixed plastic cap over the top bearing the responsible surveyor's name and license number. Older monuments may exist such as old pipes, gun barrels, axles, mounds of stone, whiskey bottles, or even wooden stakes. In addition to rods and pipes, surveyors might use 4x4" concrete posts at the corners of large parcels or anywhere which requires greater stability (e.g. beach sand). They place the posts three feet deep.

In locations where there is asphalt or concrete, it is common to place nails or aluminum-alloy caps to re-establish boundary corners. Marks are meant to be durable, stable, and as "permanent" as possible. The aim is to provide sufficient marks so that some of them will remain for future re-establishment of boundaries. The material and marking used for monuments placed to mark boundary corners are often subject to state laws. Many states have laws that protect existing monuments and may apply civil penalties if the markers are disturbed or destroyed.

===The art of land surveying===
Many properties have considerable problems with regard to improper bounding or miscalculations in past surveys, titles, easements, and wildlife crossings. Also, many properties are created from multiple divisions of a larger piece over the course of years, and with every additional division the risk of miscalculation increases. The result can be abutting properties not coinciding with adjacent parcels, resulting in hiatuses (gaps) and overlaps. Many times a surveyor must solve a puzzle using pieces that do not exactly fit together. In these cases, the solution is based upon the surveyor's research and interpretation, along with established procedures for resolving discrepancies. This is essentially a process of continual error correction and update, where official recordation documents countermand the previous and sometime erroneous survey documents recorded by older monuments and older survey methods.

[[Image:Diamond Core.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|Rock core samples, the product of a [[Drilling rig#Diamond core drilling|diamond rig]]. A [[pied butcherbird]] perches nearby.]]
A '''core sample''' is a cylindrical section of (usually) a naturally occurring substance. Most core samples are obtained by drilling with special drills into the substance, for example sediment or rock, with a hollow [[steel]] tube called a [[core drill]]. The hole made for the core sample is called the "core bowling". A variety of core samplers exist to sample different media under different conditions. More continue to be invented on a regular basis. In the coring process, the sample is pushed more or less intact into the tube. Removed from the tube in the laboratory, it is inspected and analyzed by different techniques and equipment depending on the type of data desired. 

Core samples can be taken to test the properties of [[manmade]] materials, such as [[concrete]], [[ceramic]]s, some [[metal]]s and alloys, especially the softer ones. Core samples can also be taken of living things, including human beings, especially of a person's bones for microscopic examination to help diagnose diseases.  

== Methods ==
[[Image:Granitic_core_Stillwater.jpg|thumb|60px|Granitic rock core from [[Stillwater igneous complex]], Montana (from a spoil pile).]]
The composition of the subject materials can vary from almost liquid to the strongest materials found in nature or technology, and the location of the subject materials can vary from on the laboratory bench to over 10&amp;nbsp;km from the surface of the Earth in a borehole. The range of equipment and techniques applied to the task is correspondingly great. Core samples are most often taken with their long axis oriented roughly parallel to the axis of a borehole, or parallel to the gravity field for the gravity-driven tools. However it is also possible to take core samples from the wall of an existing borehole. Taking samples from an exposure, albeit an overhanging rock face or on a different planet, is almost trivial. (The Mars Exploration Rovers carry a [[Rock Abrasion Tool]], which is logically equivalent to the "rotary sidewall core" tool described below.)

Some common techniques include:
* ''gravity coring'', in which the core sampler is dropped into the sample, usually the bed of a water body, but essentially the same technique can also be done on soft materials on land. The penetration forces, if recorded, give information about the strength of different depths in the material, which may be the only information required, with samples as an incidental benefit. This technique is common in both civil engineering site investigations (where the techniques tend towards into [[pile driving]]) and geological studies of recent aquatic deposits. The low strength of the materials penetrated means that cores have to be relatively small.
* ''vibracoring'', in which the sampler is vibrated to allow penetration into [[thixotropic]] media. Again, the physical strength of the subject material limits the size of core that can be retrieved.
* ''drilling'' [[exploration diamond drilling]] where a rotating annular tool backed up by a cylindrical core sample storage device is pressed against the subject materials to cut out a cylinder of the subject material. A mechanism is normally needed to retain the cylindrical sample in the coring tool. Depending on circumstances, particularly the consistency and composition of the subject materials, different arrangements may be needed within the core tools to support and protect the sample on its way to surface; it is often also necessary to control or reduce the contact between the [[drilling fluid]] and the core sample, to reduce changes from the coring process. The mechanical forces imposed on the core sample by the tool frequently lead to fracture of the core and loss of less-competent intervals, which can greatly complicate interpretation of the core. Cores can routinely be cut as small as a few [[millimeter]]s in diameter (in wood, for [[dendrochronology]]) up to over 150 millimeters in diameter (routine in [[oil exploration]]). The lengths of samples can range from less than a meter (again, in wood, for [[dendrochronology]]) up to around 200 metres in one run, though 27m to 54m is more usual (in [[oil exploration]]), and many runs can be made in succession if "quick look" analysis in the field suggests that the zone of interest is continuing.
* ''percussion sidewall coring'' uses robust cylindrical "bullets" explosively propelled into the wall of a borehole to retrieve a (relatively) small, short core sample. These tend to be heavily shattered, rendering [[porosity]]/ [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] measurements dubious, but are often sufficient for [[petrography|lithological]] and [[micropaleontology|micropalaeontological]] study. Many samples can be attempted in a single run of the tools, which are typically configured with 20 to 30 "bullets" and propulsive charges along the length of a tool. Several tools can often be ganged together for a single run. The success rates for firing a particular bullet, it penetrating the borehole wall, the retention system recovering the bullet from the borehole wall, and the sample being retained in the bullet are all relatively low, so it is not uncommon for only half the samples attempted to be successful. This is an important consideration in planning sample programmes.
* ''rotary sidewall coring'' where a miniaturised automated rotary drilling tool is applied to the side of the borehole to cut a sample similar in size to a percussion sidewall core (described above). These tend to suffer less deformation than percussion cores. However the core-cutting process takes longer and jams are common in the ancillary equipment which retrieves the sample from the drill bit and stores it within the tool body. This complicates the planning of a coring programme.

==Management of cores and data==
Although often neglected, core samples always degrade to some degree in the process of cutting the core, handling it, and studying it. Non-destructive techniques are increasingly common (e.g. the use of [[MRI]] scanning to characterize grains, pore fluids, pore spaces ([[porosity]]) and their interactions (constituting part of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]]) but such expensive subtlety is likely wasted on a core that has been shaken on an unsprung lorry for 300&amp;nbsp;km of dirt road.  What happens to cores between the retrieval equipment and the final laboratory (or archive) is an often neglected part of record keeping and core management.

[[File:Cut Bakken Core samples.jpg|thumb|Cut [[Bakken formation|Bakken]] Core samples]]Coring has come to be recognized as an important source of data, and more attention and care is being put on preventing damage to the core during various stages of it transportation and analysis. The usual way to do this is to freeze the core completely using liquid nitrogen, which is cheaply sourced. In some cases, special polymers are also used to preserve and seat/cushion the core from damage.

Equally, a core sample which cannot be related to its context (where it was before it became a core sample) has lost much of its benefit. The identification of the borehole, and the position and orientation ("way up") of the core in the borehole is critical, even if the borehole is in a tree trunk - [[dendrochronology|dendrochronologists]] always try to include a bark surface in their samples so that the date of most-recent growth of the tree can be unambiguously determined.

If these data become separated from core samples, it is generally impossible to regain that data. The cost of a coring operation can vary from a few currency units (for a hand-caught core from a soft soil section) to tens of millions of currency units (for sidewall cores from a remote-area offshore borehole many kilometres deep). Inadequate recording of such basic data has ruined the utility of both types of core.

Different disciplines have different local conventions of recording these data, and the user should familiarize themselves with their area's conventions. For example, in the oil industry, orientation of the core is typically recorded by marking the core with two longitudinal colour streaks, with the red one on the right when the core is being retrieved and marked at surface. Cores cut for mineral mining may have their own, different, conventions. Civil engineering or soil studies may have their own, different, conventions as their materials are often not competent enough to make permanent marks on.

[[File:Bakken Core samples under a black light.jpg|thumb|Bakken Core samples under a black light]]It is becoming increasingly common to retain core samples in cylindrical packaging which forms part of the core-cutting equipment, and to make the marks of record on these "inner barrels" in the field prior to further processing and analysis in the laboratory.  Sometimes core is shipped from the field to the laboratory in as long a length as it comes out of the ground; other times it is cut into standard lengths (5m or 1m or 3&amp;nbsp;ft) for shipping, then reassembled in the laboratory. Some of the "inner barrel" systems are capable of being reversed on the core sample, so that in the laboratory the sample goes "wrong way up" when the core is reassembled. This can complicate interpretation. [[File:Oriented Core Goniometer commonly used when logging core.JPG|thumb|Goniometers are used to measure angles of fractures and other features in a core sample relative to its standard orientation.]]

If the borehole has [[petrophysics|petrophysical]] measurements made of the wall rocks, and these measurements are repeated along the length of the core then the two data sets correlated, one will almost universally find that the depth "of record" for a particular piece of core differs between the two methods of measurement. Which set of measurements to believe then becomes a matter of policy for the client (in an industrial setting) or of great controversy (in a context without an overriding authority. Recording that there are discrepancies, for whatever reason, retains the possibility of correcting an incorrect decision at a later date ; destroying the "incorrect" depth data makes it impossible to correct a mistake later. Any system for retaining and archiving data and core samples needs to be designed so that dissenting opinion like this can be retained.

If core samples from a campaign are competent, it is common practice to "slab" them - cut the sample into two or more samples longitudinally - quite early in laboratory processing so that one set of samples can be archived early in the analysis sequence as a protection against errors in processing. "Slabbing" the core into a 2/3 and a 1/3 set is common. It is also common for one set to be retained by the main customer while the second set goes to the government (who often impose a condition for such donation as a condition of exploration/ exploitation licensing). "Slabbing" also has the benefit of preparing a flat, smooth surface for examination and testing of profile permeability, which is very much easier to work with than the typically rough, curved surface of core samples when they're fresh from the coring equipment. Photography of raw and "slabbed" core surfaces is routine, often under both natural and ultra-violet light.
[[File:Pulling the Bakken Core out of the core barrell.JPG|thumb|Pulling the Bakken Core out of the core barrell]]

A unit of length occasionally used in the literature on seabed cores is ''cmbsf'', an abbreviation for centimeters below sea floor.

==History of coring==
The technique of coring long predates attempts to drill into the [[Earth]]’s [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] by the [[Deep Sea Drilling Program]]. The value to oceanic and other [[geologic history]] of obtaining cores over a wide area of [[sea floor]]s soon became apparent. Core sampling by many scientific and exploratory organizations expanded rapidly. To date hundreds of thousands of core samples have been collected from floors of all the planet’s [[ocean]]s and many of its [[inland water]]s. 
Access to many of these samples is facilitated by the [[Index to Marine &amp; Lacustrine Geological Samples]],
:"A collaboration between twenty institutions and agencies that operate geological repositories."
The above agency keeps a record of the samples held in the repositories of its member organizations. Data includes

:"[[Lithography]], [[Texture (geology)|texture]], age, principal investigator, [[Geologic province|province]], [[weathering]]/[[metamorphism]], [[glass]] remarks and descriptive comments"
[[File:Lower Bakken-3 Forks Transition.JPG|thumb|Lower Bakken-3 Forks Transition]]
==Informational value of core samples==

Coring began as a method of sampling surroundings of ore deposits and oil exploration. It soon expanded to [[ocean]]s, [[lake]]s, [[Ice core|ice]], [[mud]], [[soil]] and [[Dendrochronology|wood]]. Cores on very old [[tree]]s give information about their growth rings without destroying the tree. 

Cores indicate variations of [[climate]], [[species]] and [[sediment]]ary composition during geologic history. The dynamic phenomena of the Earth’s surface are for the most part cyclical in a number of ways, especially [[temperature]] and [[rainfall]].

There are many ways to date a core. Once dated, it gives valuable information about changes of climate and [[terrain]]. For example, cores in the ocean floor, soil and ice have altered the view of the geologic history of the [[Pleistocene]] entirely.

[[Image:CM-Departements par region.png|thumb|left|350px|Departments of Cameroon]]

The [[Regions of Cameroon]] are divided into 58 [[division (subnational entity)|divisions]] or [[department (subnational entity)|departments]]. The divisions are further sub-divided into sub-divisions (''[[arrondissement]]s'') and [[district]]s. The divisions are listed below, by province.
[[File:Provinces of Cameroon EN.svg|thumb|upright|Cameroon is divided into 10 regions.]] 
{{Main|Regions of Cameroon|Divisions of Cameroon}}
The [[Constitution of Cameroon|constitution]] divides Cameroon into 10 semi-autonomous regions, each under the administration of an elected [[Regional Council (Cameroon)|Regional Council]]. A presidential decree of 12 November 2008 officially instigated the change from provinces to regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prc.cm/index_fr.php?link=les_actes/lecture_act&amp;id=79&amp;lang=fr&amp;quoi=D%E9cret Décret N° 2008/376 du 12 novembre 2008], President of the Republic website. Accessed 9 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor. These leaders are charged with implementing the will of the president, reporting on the general mood and conditions of the regions, administering the civil service, keeping the peace, and overseeing the heads of the smaller administrative units. Governors have broad powers: they may order propaganda in their area and call in the army, [[gendarmerie|gendarmes]], and police.&lt;ref&gt;Neba 250.&lt;/ref&gt; All local government officials are employees of the central government’s Ministry of Territorial Administration, from which local governments also get most of their budgets.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26431.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The regions are subdivided into 58 divisions (departments). These are headed by presidentially appointed divisional officers ({{lang|fr|[[prefect|préfets]]}}), who perform the governors' duties on a smaller scale. The divisions are further sub-divided into sub-divisions ({{lang|fr|arrondissements}}), headed by assistant divisional officers ({{lang|fr|sous-prefets}}). The districts, administered by district heads ({{lang|fr|chefs de district}}), are the smallest administrative units. These are found in large sub-divisions and in regions that are difficult to reach.

The three northernmost regions are the [[Far North Region (Cameroon)|Far North]] ({{lang|fr|Extrême Nord}}), [[North Region (Cameroon)|North]] ({{lang|fr|Nord}}), and [[Adamawa Region|Adamawa]] ({{lang|fr|Adamaoua}}). Directly south of them are the [[Centre Region (Cameroon)|Centre]] ({{lang|fr|Centre}}) and [[East Region (Cameroon)|East]] ({{lang|fr|Est}}). The [[South Region (Cameroon)|South Province]] ({{lang|fr|Sud}}) lies on the Gulf of Guinea and the southern border. Cameroon's western region is split into four smaller regions: The [[Littoral Region (Cameroon)|Littoral]] ({{lang|fr|Littoral}}) and [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest]] ({{lang|fr|Sud-Ouest}}) regions are on the coast, and the [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest]] ({{lang|fr|Nord-Ouest}}) and [[West Region (Cameroon)|West]] ({{lang|fr|Ouest}}) regions are in the western grassfields. The Northwest and Southwest were once part of British Cameroons; the other regions were in French Cameroun.

'''Dhundhar''', also known as ''Jaipur region'', is a [[Historical region|historical]] [[list of regions of India|region]] of [[Rajasthan]] state in western [[India]]. It includes the districts of [[Jaipur District|Jaipur]], [[Dausa District|Dausa]], [[Sawai Madhopur District|Sawai Madhopur]], and [[Tonk District|Tonk]] and the northern part of [[Karauli District]].

The region lies in east-central Rajasthan, and is bounded by the [[Aravalli Range]] on the northwest, [[Ajmer region|Ajmer]] to the west, [[Mewar]] region to the southwest, [[Hadoti]] region to the south, and [[Alwar District|Alwar]], [[Bharatpur District|Bharatpur]], and Karauli districts to the east.

== Geography ==
In 1900, at the times of Jaipur Kingdom, region had a total area of 15,579 square miles (40,349&amp;nbsp;km²).
[[File:Dhundhar Region (RAJ.) Suresh Godara.jpg|thumb|Dhundhar region includes areas near Jaipur.]]
The southern and central portions of the region lie in the basin of the [[Banas River]] and its tributaries, including the [[Dhund River]], which gives its name to the region. The northern portion of the region is drained by the [[Ban Ganga River]], which originates in Jaipur district and flows east to join the [[Yamuna]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]] state.

== History ==
{{see |Jaipur State}}
The state of Jaipur was earlier knows as [[Amber]] or Dhundhar and was ruled by [[Meena|Meena tribe]], who held a fortress at Naen. later a [[Kachhwaha]] prince destroyed the sovereignty of Naen.&lt;ref name="amberdhundar"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=q29TcbHrMfUC&amp;dq=meena+rulers&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=Tribal Cultures and Change | publisher=Mittal Publications | author=Rann Singh Mann, K. Mann | year=1989 | pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
Generally liberal policies of the rulers permitted [[Jainism]] to flourish at [[Amber, India|Amber]] and later at Jaipur.

It continues to be one of the most important centers of Jainism in India. It is here where the [[Bispanth]]i/[[Digambar Terapanth]]i divisions among the Jains emerged in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;John E.

Meister (eds.), Multiple Histories: Culture and Society in the Study of Rajasthan, 39-83. Jaipur: Rawat, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century the [[Chittor]] seat of the [[Bhattaraka]]s of [[Mula Sangh]] [[Saraswati gachchha]] moved from Champawati to Sanganer and then to Amber and finally to Jaipur where the last Bhattarka was present until 1965. The lineage is:

{{Geodesy}}

'''ED50''' ("'''European Datum 1950'''") is a [[datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]] which was defined after [[World War II]] for the international connection of [[geodetic network]]s.

==Background==
Some of the important battles of World War II were fought on the borders of [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[France]], and the mapping of these countries had incompatible [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] positioning. This led to the setting up of ED50 as a consistent mapping datum for much of [[Western Europe]]. It was, and still is, used in much of Western Europe apart from [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]], which have their own datums.

It used the [[International Ellipsoid]] of 1924 ("[[John Fillmore Hayford|Hayford]]-Ellipsoid" of 1909) ([[Earth radius|radius]] of the Earth's [[equator]] 6378.388&amp;nbsp;km, [[flattening]] 1/297, both exact). That spheroid was an early attempt to model the whole Earth and was widely used around the world until the 1980s when [[GRS 80]] and [[WGS 84]] were established.

Many national coordinate systems of [[Gauss–Krüger coordinate system|Gauss–Krüger]] are defined by ED50 and oriented by means of [[geodetic astronomy]]. Up to now it has been used in [[database]]s of gravity fields, [[cadastre]], small [[surveying]] networks in Europe and America, and by some developing countries with no modern baselines. ED50 was also part of the fundamentals of the [[NATO]] coordinates ([[Gauss–Krüger coordinate system|Gauss–Krüger]] and [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]]) up to the 1980s.

The geodetic datum of '''ED50''' was centred at the [[Helmertturm]] on the [[Telegrafenberg]] in [[Potsdam]], (then East) [[Germany]]; the intent was to encourage cooperation with the socialist states during the [[cold war]], which failed. The adjustments for later versions of the datum ([[ED77]], [[ED79]]) used the [[Munich Frauenkirche]] as starting point.

==Datum shift between ED50 and WGS 84==

The longitude and latitude lines on the two datums are the same in the Archangel region of north-west [[Russia]]. As one moves westwards across Europe, the longitude lines on ED50 gradually become further west than their WGS&amp;nbsp;84 equivalents, and are around 100 metres west in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. Moving southwards, the latitude lines on ED50 gradually become further south than the WGS&amp;nbsp;84 lines, and are around 100 m south in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. 

This means that if the lines are further west, the longitude value of any given point becomes more easterly. Similarly, if the lines are south, the values become northerly. This is due to the fact that the International Ellipsoid is larger than the GRS&amp;nbsp;80/WGS&amp;nbsp;84 ellipsoid, so a given north-south distance will cover more latitude on the new ellipsoid, and a given east-west distance will cover more longitude.

The datum shift for the [[Universal Transverse Mercator]] grid is different. The eastings vary between 0 m in Eastern Europe and 100 m in the far west of the continent, roughly similar to the longitude shift, but the northings are about 200 m different across Europe, with the ED50 UTM northing lines south of the WGS&amp;nbsp;84 UTM northing lines. UTM northings are measured from the Equator; distance from the equator to latitude 50 degrees is 112 m more on the International than on the WGS&amp;nbsp;84 spheroid.

'''English county histories''', in other words historical and topographical (or "[[Chorography|chorographical]]") works concerned with individual [[ancient counties of England]], were produced by [[antiquarian]]s from the late 16th century onwards. The content was variable: some recorded [[archaeological site]]s, but others were heavily slanted towards the genealogies of county families and other biographical material, particularly relating to property and the descent of lordships of [[manor]]s. The tradition continues with the series of [[Victoria County History|Victoria County Histories]].

A closely related genre, which emerged in the second half of the 17th century, was the county "Natural History", which focused on the county's flora, fauna and natural phenomena, but which also often included chapters on antiquities. The best known examples were [[Robert Plot]]'s two volumes on Oxfordshire (1677) and Staffordshire (1686); and [[John Aubrey]]'s unpublished work on Wiltshire.

==Development==
[[William Lambarde]]'s ''Perambulation of [[Kent]]'' (completed 1570; published 1576) is generally acknowledged as the first example of the genre. It was followed by [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew's]] ''Survey of Cornwall'' (1602), and [[William Burton (antiquary, died 1645)|William Burton's]] ''Description of Leicester Shire'' (1622), as well as a number of other projects (such as those of [[Sir William Pole]], [[Thomas Westcote]], and [[Tristram Risdon]] in Devon, and [[Sampson Erdeswicke]] in Staffordshire) which, although they sometimes circulated in manuscript, did not come to completion or publication. Following the appearance of [[William Dugdale]]'s ''Antiquities of Warwickshire'' (1656), a pattern was set. In the nineteenth century [[John Bowyer Nichols]] followed the line of a history of [[Leicestershire]] compiled by his father [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]], and saw numerous counties histories through the press at his printing firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Nichols, John Bowyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of county histories varied, but the titles became quite standard: "Antiquities of", "Worthies of", "Geological survey", "Description of", later "Directory of", all could indicate the intention of producing a "history", a term that only in later times acquired the narrower meaning it carries today. [[Chorography]], [[topography]] and [[toponymy]] might all be involved. Materials and collections for their counties were made by antiquaries, but publication might await sponsorship or enough subscriptions, as well as a capable author who would make a readable book, perhaps of multiple volumes, from notes.

The '''Eurasia Basin''', or '''Eurasian Basin''', is one of the two major basins into which the [[Arctic Basin]] of the [[Arctic Ocean]] is split by the [[Lomonosov Ridge]] (other being the [[Amerasian Basin|Amerasia Basin]]). The Eurasia Basin may be seen as an extension of the [[Atlantic basin#Ocean bottom|North Atlantic Basin]] through [[Fram Strait]]. It is further split by the [[Mid-ocean ridge|mid-ocean]] [[Gakkel Ridge]] into the [[Nansen Basin]] and the [[Amundsen Basin]]. The latter basin is the deepest one of the [[Arctic Ocean]] and the geographic [[North Pole]] is located there.

The Eurasia Basin is bounded by [[Greenland]], the [[Lomonosov Ridge]], and the [[continental shelf|shelves]] of the [[Laptev Sea]], [[Kara Sea]] and [[Barents Sea]]. The maximum depth within the Eurasia Basin is reached at the [[Litke Deep]] with 5449 [[m]] depth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/forecaster_handbooks/Arctic/Forecasters%20Handbook%20for%20the%20Arctic.02.pdf Physical characteristics of the Arctic]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, the Gakkel Ridge is the site of some of the slowest [[seafloor spreading]] on the Earth, with 10 mm/yr near the Fram Strait and 6 mm/yr near the Laptev Sea. Initial opening of the Eurasia Basin is constrained by magnetic anomaly and geologic information to the [[Cenozoic]]: it was first created about 53 Million years ago by the spreading of the sea floor.&lt;ref&gt;"Plate Tectonics Model for the Evolution of the Arctic", ''Geology'', vol. 2, Issue 8, p.377 (1974) {{doi|10.1130/0091-7613(1974)2&lt;377:PTMFTE&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of the European Union mini}}
A '''European political party''' (formally, a '''political party at European level'''; informally a '''Europarty''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/content.html|title=Parties &amp; Elections in Europe|author=Wolfram Nordsieck|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[political party]] organisation operating transnationally in Europe and in the institutions of the [[European Union]]. They are regulated and funded by the European Union and are usually made up of national parties, not individuals. Europarties have the exclusive right to campaign during the [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]] and express themselves within the [[European Parliament]] by their affiliated [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political groups]] and their [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]]. Europarties, through coordination meetings with their affiliated heads of state and government, influence the decision-making process of the [[European Council]]. Europarties also work closely and co-ordinate with their affiliated members of the [[European Commission]] and, according to the [[Lisbon Treaty]] the Europarty that wins the European elections has the right to nominate to the [[European Council]] its candidate for [[President of the European Commission]].{{clarify|date=June 2018}}

The term "political party in the EU" can mean three different types of entities: domestic political parties, political groups in the European Parliament, and European political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lelieveldt|first1=Herman|last2=Princen|first2=Sebatiaan|title=The politics of the European Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=U0rpNQWakqkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=The+politics+of+the+European+Union&amp;ots=jNyVA_ADef&amp;sig=ZqhqssrMibR4M5K_G-pzLTiiWYc#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20politics%20of%20the%20European%20Union&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Timeline===

====1992====
Section 41 of the [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty of Maastricht]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:11992M/TXT:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 11992M/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; added Article 138a to the [[Treaty of Rome]]. Article 138a (later renumbered to Article 191) stated that "Political parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union. They contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union." So the concept of a "political party at European level" was born.

====1997====
Article J.18 and Article K.13 of the [[Amsterdam Treaty|Treaty of Amsterdam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:11997D/TXT:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 11997D/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; established who should pay for expenditure authorised by Article 138/191 within certain areas. This provided a mechanism whereby Europarties could be paid for out of the European budget, and the Europarties started to spend the money. Such expenditure included funding national parties, an outcome not originally intended.

====2001====
Article 2, section 19 of the [[Treaty of Nice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12001C/TXT:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 12001C/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; added a ''second'' paragraph to Article 191 of the [[Treaty of Rome]]. That paragraph stated that "The Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251, shall lay down the regulations governing political parties at European level and in particular the rules regarding their funding." The reference to "Article 251" refers to [[Codecision procedure|co-decision]], which meant the European Parliament had to be involved. So Europarty funding had to be regulated by the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and the [[European Parliament]], acting together.

====2003====
Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R2004:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 32003R2004 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined what a "political party at European level" actually ''was'' and specified that funding should not go to national parties, either directly or indirectly. This meant that European money should stay at the Europarty level and, as a result, the nascent Europarties started to organise themselves on a more European basis instead of acting as a mechanism for funding national parties.

====2007====
That regulation was later heavily amended by the Decision of the Bureau of the European Parliament of 29 March 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004D0612(01):EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 32004D0612(01) - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by other amendments, the latest of which is Regulation (EC) No 1524/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32007R1524:EN:NOT Regulation (EC) No 1524/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2007].&lt;/ref&gt; These amendments tightened up the procedures and funding and provided for the earlier-floated&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/24148 EU in drive to make Brussels more political] euobserver.com 29 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; concept of a "[[political foundation at European level]]". This meant that the Europarties can set up and fund legally separate affiliated think-tanks (the [[political foundation at European level|Eurofoundations]]) to aid them, although funding national parties remains forbidden. The revised regulation also gives Europarties the exclusive responsibility to campaign for the European elections and can use their funds for this purpose (their corresponding [[political groups of the European Parliament]] are strictly forbidden to campaign).

====2014====
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1141/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014R1141 |title=Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1141/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the statute and funding of European political parties and European political foundations |date=22 October 2014 |publisher=Official Journal of the European Union |access-date=16 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; overhauled the existing framework for European Political Parties and Foundations, including by giving them legal status, and establishes an Authority for the purpose of registering, controlling and imposing sanctions on European political parties and European political foundations. The Authority will be a [[body of the European Union]].

This regulation repealed Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003, however the provisions of that regulation shall continue to apply for the 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 budget years. Although it came into force on 24 November 2014, the regulations shall only apply from 1 January 2017. The Authority shall however be set up by 1 September 2016. European political parties and European political foundations registered after 1 January 2017 may only apply for funding under this Regulation for activities starting in the 2018 budget year or thereafter.

===Defunct Europarties===
* The [[Alliance of Independent Democrats in Europe]], a loose association of [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s and [[nationalism|nationalist]]s, met the recognition threshold from 2006 to 2008.&lt;ref name="EP20090120TMN46722"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EPsubventions_2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EPgrantamounts_2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/grants/grant_amounts_parties.pdf|title="Grants from the European Parliament to political parties at European level 2004-2011"], 9 July 2011, from [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ http://www.europarl.europa.eu/|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The heterogeneous [[Alliance for Europe of the Nations]], which included moderate nationalists, [[National conservatism|national conservative]]s and [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s, met the recognition threshold from 2004 to 2009.&lt;ref name="EP20090120TMN46722"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EPsubventions_2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EPgrantamounts_2011"/&gt;
* The Eurosceptic, national conservative, right populist [[Movement for a Europe of Liberties and Democracy]] was recognised from 2012 to 2016.
* On 1 November 2008 [[Declan Ganley]] had registered a company in [[Dublin]] called the ''[[Libertas (lobby group)|Libertas Party Ltd]]''.&lt;ref name="IT1225321623322"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1101/1225321623322.html|title="Ganley registers Libertas as a European political party" from the Irish Times, Saturday 1 November 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertas applied for Europarty recognition which was briefly granted but then suspended following the disavowal of two of its candidates.

== Organisation ==

===Regulations===
As of 1 November 2008, the regulation governing Europarties is Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 November 2003,&lt;ref name="SCADl33315"/&gt; as later amended&lt;ref name="PreLex195908"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/prelex/detail_dossier_real.cfm?CL=en&amp;DosId=195908|title=EUR-Lex - 2007_130 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; under codecision (see above). According to that regulation's European Commission factsheet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/institutional_affairs/institutions_bodies_and_agencies/l33315_en.htm|title=EUR-Lex - l33315 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a party to become a Europarty it must meet the following criteria:

* it must have legal personality in the Member State in which its seat is located.
* it must observe the founding principles of the European Union, namely the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law.
* it must have participated, or intend to participate, in elections to the European Parliament.
* it must have in at least one quarter of the Member States, one or both of the following:
** either it must have received at least 3% of the votes cast in each of those Member States at the most recent European Parliament elections.
** or it must already be represented by Members, whether Members of the European Parliament for those states, or Members of the national Parliaments of those states, or Members of the regional Parliaments of those states, or Members of the regional Assemblies of those states.
* it must publish its revenue and expenditure annually.
* it must publish a statement of its assets and liabilities annually.
* it must provide a list of its donors and their donations exceeding €500.
* it must not accept anonymous donations.
* it must not accept donations exceeding €12,000 per year and per donor.
* it must not accept donations from the budgets of [[political groups of the European Parliament]].
* it must not accept more than 40% of a national political party's annual budget.
* it must not accept donations from any company over which the public authorities may exercise a dominant influence, either by virtue of their ownership of it, or by their financial participation therein.
* it must get at least 15% of its budget from sources other than its European Union funding.
* it must submit its application by 30 September before the financial year that it wants funding for.

===Funding===
The initial total funding for 2012 was €15 million pre-financing. A further 20% (18.9 million) was given later on in the next year after accounts are presented, with yet further €9.720 million pre-financing for the foundations.&lt;ref name="EP20090120TMN46722"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2009/highlights/product.htm?ref=20090120TMN46722&amp;secondRef=0&amp;language=EN&amp;section=10|title=Previous elections|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPsubventions_2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/tenders/subventions_2005.htm|title=Liste des subventions octroyées en 2005 / List of grants awarded in 2005|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IP071953"&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/1953&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en Press Release IP/07/1953, Brussels, 18 December 2007] europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
All current Europarties are mostly made up of national parties, individual members (MP or MEPs): MPs who are members of member parties can become members of the Europarty. Additionally, people can become individual members of the Europarty without having to join a national party first (e.g. [[Marian Harkin]], who is an individual member of the [[European Democratic Party]]).

'''Glenstone''' is a [[Contemporary art|contemporary]] [[art museum]] in [[Potomac, Maryland]], 15 miles from downtown [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C]]. It contains about 1,300 works in many mediums from post-World War II artists around the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/arts/design/glenstone-expansion-mitchell-rales.html|title=Glenstone, a Private Art Xanadu, Invests $200 Million in a Public Vision|last=Pogrebin|first=Robert|date=2018-09-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002070547/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/arts/design/glenstone-expansion-mitchell-rales.html|archive-date=2018-10-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; First opened in 2006, the museum was expanded several times in size in between 2013 and 2018 on its 230-acre campus. A significant expansion was opened to the public on October 4, 2018, with the introduction of a new museum complex called the Pavilions, an arrival hall, entry pavilion, bookstore and two cafés. The museum was developed and financed by [[billionaire]] American businessman [[Mitchell Rales]], and is open free to the public via online booking.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/lifestyle/glenstone-museum/|title=Glenstone: See inside (and outside) D.C.’s newest museum experience|last=Smee|first=Sebastian|last2=Higgins|first2=Adrian|date=|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002064647/https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/lifestyle/glenstone-museum/|archive-date=2018-10-02|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1986, Rales purchased the Potomac, Maryland property, a former [[fox hunting]] club, in order to build a home. Soon thereafter, Rales began collecting art for that home. Rales first conceived of the idea of establishing a museum following a near-death accident on a helicopter trip, which inclined him to take on a philanthropical project. Glenstone is named for the nearby Glen Road, and because of [[Quarry|stone quarries]] located in the vicinity. The museum's initial 30,000 square foot [[Modernism|Modernist]] [[limestone]] gallery opened in 2006, and admitted visitors two days a week. In its first seven years of existence, the museum admitted 10,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/arts/design/mitchell-and-emily-rales-are-expanding-glenstone-museum.html|title=Mitchell and Emily Rales Are Expanding Glenstone Museum|last=Vogel|first=Carol|date=2013-04-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923235428/https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/arts/design/mitchell-and-emily-rales-are-expanding-glenstone-museum.html|archive-date=2018-09-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major expansion was announced in 2013 and was completed in 2018, opening to the public on October 4, 2018. The expansion cost approximately $219 million and increased the size of the museum by a factor of five, and included substantial landscaping changes to the 230-acre property.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/glenstone-museum-expansion|title=Tour the New $200 Million Expansion of One of America's Most Important—and Unknown—Museums|last=Mendelsohn|first=Meredith|date=2018-09-27|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927194035/https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/glenstone-museum-expansion|archive-date=2018-09-27|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/arts/article/21024414/the-new-glenstone-is-an-art-retreat-in-the-wilds-of-montgomery-county|title=The New Glenstone is a Contemporary Art Retreat in the Wilds of Montgomery County|last=Capps|first=Kriston|date=2018-09-27|work=Washington City Paper|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2018 expansion, Glenstone continued to acquire adjacent properties, including lots containing residential homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2018/11/15/glenstone-foundation-buys-more-land-in-potomac.html|title=Glenstone Foundation buys more land in Potomac near museum|last=Maake|first=Katishi|date=2018-11-15|website=Washington Business Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection and exhibitions ==
The museum's collection of about 1,300 post-World War II works consists of [[paintings]], single-artist installations, [[sound installations]], and both indoor and outdoor [[sculptures]]. One of the collection's constraints is that it only contains works by artists who have already exhibited for at least 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/museums/the-10-pieces-you-must-see-at-glenstone/2018/10/02/5eab9432-c043-11e8-90c9-23f963eea204_story.html|title=The 10 pieces you must see at Glenstone|last=Smee|first=Sebastian|date=2018-10-03|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the museum's galleries feature only one artist, and do not contain explanatory text.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The museum is staffed by recent college graduates through its "Emerging Professionals Program", a two-year program for aspiring curators. This uniformed staff is stationed in the galleries to answer questions from visitors about the art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/meet-the-very-wealthy-very-private-couple-behind-washingtons-most-original-museum/2018/09/21/b843425a-9f29-11e8-83d2-70203b8d7b44_story.html|title=Meet the very wealthy, very private couple behind Washington’s most original museum|last=Edgers|first=Geoff|date=2018-09-24|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the introduction of the Pavilions expansion debuted single-artist installations and exhibitions from artists [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Gober]], [[Pipilotti Rist]], [[Charles Ray (artist)|Charles Ray]], [[On Kawara]], [[Martin Puryear]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Lygia Pape]], [[Brice Marden]]. Other artists on display in the inaugural exhibition of the expansion included [[Roni Horn]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Ruth Asawa]], [[David Hammons]], [[Alighiero Boetti]], and [[Mark Rothko]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glenstone.org/the-pavilions/|title=Glenstone - The Pavilions|last=|first=|date=|website=www.glenstone.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
Glenstone consists of a cluster of distinctively designed museum galleries and other buildings set in a large wooded campus.

The original Glenstone building opened in 2006 and was designed by American [[architect]] [[Charles Gwathmey]] of [[Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates Architects]]. The building was a 30,000 square foot [[Modernism|modernist]] [[limestone]] structure with 9,000 feet of gallery space, located on 100 acres of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archpaper.com/2018/09/glenstone-museum-pavilions-thomas-phifer/#gallery-0-slide-0|title=AN tours the Glenstone Museum's new Pavilions|last=Hilburg|first=Jonathan|date=2018-09-24|website=archpaper.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 expansion added 50,000 square feet of gallery space in a 204,000 square foot museum building called "the Pavilions", which was designed by American architect [[Thomas Phifer]]. Among the influences for the design is the [[Ryōan-ji|Ryoan-ji Zen temple]] in [[Kyoto]], Japan. The Pavilions is built of cast-concrete blocks that were poured during different seasons to produce variable coloring. Though it is one building, the Pavilions is meant to appear as multiple separate buildings from a distance. The structure contains eleven galleries connected by glass-enclosed walkways. The galleries make heavy use of natural light through [[Clerestory|clerestories]], [[Oculus|oculi]], and [[Skylight|skylights]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Pavilions is built around the "Water Court", an 18,000 square foot [[water garden]] containing thousands of aquatic plants such as [[Nymphaea|waterlilies]], [[Iris sibirica|irises]], [[Thalia (plant)|thalias]], [[Typha|cattails]], and [[Juncaceae|rushes]]. The Water Court's design was inspired by the reflecting pool at [[Brion Cemetery]] in northern Italy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The expansion also added 130 acres of land, with the museum buildings located toward the center of the 230 acre property. Visitors approach the galleries from gravel parking lots via a pathway through the property that is about third of a mile (0.5 km) long. The landscape is largely woodland and wildflower meadows, and was designed by [[landscape architect]] [[Peter Walker (landscape architect)|Peter Walker]]. The effort included the planting of about 8,000 trees, the transplanting of 200 trees, and restorations of streams flowing through the campus. Types of trees in the landscape include [[Sycamore tree|sycamore]], [[oak]], [[Cercis|redbud]], [[dogwood]], [[honey locust]], and [[Fagus sylvatica|copper beech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/glenstones-landcaping-as-mindful-as-its-artwork/2018/10/02/202b1e3c-abc9-11e8-8a0c-70b618c98d3c_story.html|title=Glenstone’s landscaping is as mindful as its artwork|last=Higgins|first=Adrian|date=2018-10-02|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This outdoor space hosts several large art installations, as well as an environmental center that explains Glenstone's sustainable upkeep practices.

== Reception ==
In a positive review for [[The Washington Post]] in 2018, [[Philip Kennicott]] wrote that Glenstone is a "must-see" museum and that its creators successfully "integrate art, architecture, and landscape." Referring to the natural setting of the museum, he wrote that "everything is quietly spectacular, with curated views to the outdoors that present nature as visual haiku." Kennicott tempered his review by mentioning that the museum's distinctive architecture and layout continually confront visitors with "strange visions" that will make it "interesting to see how it is received".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/the-countrys-newest-must-see-museum-is-meticulous-and-quietly-spectacular/2018/09/20/068bac40-bd07-11e8-b7d2-0773aa1e33da_story.html|title=The country’s newest must-see museum is meticulous and quietly spectacular|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|date=2018-09-21|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kriston Capps of [[Washington City Paper]] called Glenstone's 2018 expansion "successful" and "enchanting", with a "sublime" viewing experience. He wrote that the museum's collection excels in its focus around conventional paintings, sculptures, and installations, but excludes more modern media, such as video or performance art. With respect to this "conservative" focus, Capps wrote, "Glenstone is not promoting equity, addressing inequality, or solving accessibility — not yet anyhow."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1898">Since 1990, The '''International Society of Environmental Ethics''' (ISEE) has striven to advance research and education in the field of [[environmental ethics]] and philosophy, and to promote appropriate human use, respect, conservation, preservation, and understanding of the natural world. In conjunction with the [[International Association for Environmental Philosophy]] (IAEP) and sponsorship from the Center for Environmental Philosophy, the society hosts an annual joint ISEE-IAEP conference each summer. It also has regular sessions at the three divisional conferences of the [[American Philosophical Association]] and publishes the ''ISEE Newsletter''.

ISEE was an official observer [[NGO]] at the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]], Rio de Janeiro, June 1992. [[Holmes Rolston]] and [[J. Baird Callicott]] were the delegates. ISEE participated in the United Nations Conference on Ethical Issues in Agenda 21, January 1994, at the United Nations in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of ISEE |url=http://enviroethics.org/history/ |work=ISEE Website |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISEE maintains an extensive website and it sponsors the largest bibliography in the world on environmental ethics, the Online Bibliography of Environmental Thought (OBET),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Bibliography of Environmental Thought |url=http://isee-obet.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 16,000 entries. It publishes a newsletter three times a year, with newsletters from the past twenty years available at the organization's website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17579">The birthplace of the great twelfth-century poet [[Jayadeva]] has been disputed, with the neighboring states of [[Odisha]] and [[Bengal]] in eastern [[India]] staking a claim. This had led to a bitter feud between people on both sides that lasted for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://orissamatters.com/news/index.php/2001/12/11/bengalis-had-a-jayadeva-too/
|title=Bengalis has a Jayadeva too
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue is still debated by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reddy|first=William|title=Longing and Sexuality in Europe, South Asia, and Japan, 900-1200 CE|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226706283|page=257|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrKScdZ8M8kC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=Jayadeva+bengal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PL1jUqDxOMHM0QW7voDgCw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Jayadeva%20bengal&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Odia view==
Protagonists of the Odia viewpoint point out that all of Jayadeva's composition took place when the poet was in Puri, supporting the idea that he must have lived in Puri for most, if not all of his life.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological discoveries in Odisha establish Jayadeva's extended presence in Odisha. There also exists a village called ''Kenduli Sasan'' in Odisha where the Hindu deity Krishna, who was also the main theme in Jayadeva's works, has traditionally been worshipped as the main god. Coincidentally, the inhabitants of that village also worship Jayadeva. A ''Sasan'' is a name for villages that traditionally were centers of Brahmin scholarly activity in Odisha, and Jayadeva himself was a Brahmin.

Furthermore, researchers opine that Jayadeva is among the central-most figures in Odia culture.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It has been pointed out that the Gita Govinda's influence outside Odisha is most felt in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where verses of the poet's work have been incorporated into the [[Kuchipudi]], [[Kathakali]] and [[Bharatanatyam]] classical dance forms respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sankeertanam.com/saints%20texts/Jayadeva%20&amp;%20Gita%20Govindam_2003_SK.pdf

&lt;/ref&gt; Odia [[bhajan]]s (devotional songs) and traditional [[Odissi music|Odissi Music]] are based on [[raga]]s and [[Tala (music)|tala]]s specified by Jayadeva's hymns.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Jayadeva was a devotee of Krishna, and Krishna in the form of [[Jagannath]] is the central deity of Odisha, whereas the female deity [[Durga]] is prominent in Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gita Govinda]] composed by Jayadeva is one of the popular themes in the traditional ''[[patachitra]]'' paintings of Odisha.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In stark contrast, according to Thomas Donaldson, an American specialist on Indian art history, Jayadeva's ragas do not match the lyrical patterns of Bengal, which unlike Odisha, does not even possess a classical vocal tradition.&lt;ref&gt;

{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/8170183936/

|year=1987}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of correlation between Bengali traditional music and the compositions of Jayadeva were independently observed in Barbara Stoler Miller's book, [[Love Song of the Dark Lord]]. Additionally, a highly Sanskritized and sophisticated classical culture had been firmly entrenched in Odisha during that period, while neighboring Bengal only had a folk based culture until recent times.

===Archaeological evidence===
Supporters of Odisha as his birthplace, including the Odisha state government, argue that the archaeological records, including temple inscriptions, palm manuscripts and lithographs of that era have revealed the poet's Odia origin.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The worship of the Hindu deity, Krishna, in the form of Jagannath was widespread in Odisha during Jayadeva's birth.&lt;ref&gt;

|title=Panoramic palmleaf manuscripts of Odisha

&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, they argue that there is no archaeological evidence of such worship in Bengal until the arrival of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]], which was over three centuries after the era of Jayadeva.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Inscription at the ''Lingaraj'' temple in Bhubaneswar tells us that Jayadeva had been a member of the teaching faculty of the school at ''Srikurmapataka'', near Puri in Odisha. The inscriptions, that refer to "Sadhu Pradhan Jayadeva" were carved by the Odisha monarch of that period.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Later discoveries of inscriptions at the ''Madhukeswar'' and ''Simhachal'' temples, also in Odisha, are believed to establish the linkage between Jayadeva and the dancing families of ''Kurmapataka'', who held sway during the reign of the Odishian monarch ''Chodagangadeva''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence based on medieval manuscripts===
Furthermore, scholars maintain that accounts by numerous medieval authors, such as ''Chandra Dutta'' of Mithila and ''Navaji'' of Gwalior supports Odisha as the poet's birthplace. The poet ''Mahipati'' of Maharashtra writes in his book ''Bhakti Bijaya'', that Jayadeva's native village was very close to Puri.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Assamese text, ''Sampradaya Kula Dipak'' as well as the Telugu text, ''Sanskruta Kabi Jivani'', contain elaborate descriptions of the poet's birth taking place near the Jagannath Dham in Utkala (Odisha). Another book, ''Vaishnava Leelamruta'' by ''Madhaba Patnaik'' who lived in the sixteenth century and was contemporaneous to [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]], clearly mentions that the poet was born near Puri.

Some further details about Jayadeva have been garnered from Madhaba Patnaik's book. It gives a clear account of Chaitanya's visit to Puri.  He mentions that Chaitanya paid a visit to Kenduli Sasan near Puri to pay homage to Jayadeva and to chant passages from the Gita Govinda.  The book mentions that Kenduli Sasan was in fact the birthplace of the illustrious poet.  Madhava Patnaik's book also gives an account of Jayadeva's early life from the legends around Puri.  It mentions Jayadeva as excelling in the ''Shastras'' and the ''Puranas'' (sacred Hindu texts) from early childhood.

=== Evidence from Jayadeva's own writings ===
Historians now suggest that some of the poet's own compositions in Odia unequivocally support the idea that Jayadeva belonged to Puri, Odisha.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/july2003/englishchpter/Hymns%20to%20Jagannatha.pdf
|title=Hymns to Jagannatha
|year=2006|format=PDF}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Jayadeva mentions his birthplace as "Kendubilva by the sea" ("''Kendubilva Samudra Sambhava''") in his 7th ''Ashtapadi'', and Birbhum, unlike Puri, does not abut on the sea. Jayadeva used to bathe each morning in the banks of a river, mentions the book ''Bhaktamala''. A. K. Tripathy, an eminent scholar on Jayadeva, and P. C. Tripathy point out that the poet could never have walked daily to the river ''Ajeya'' which is 36 miles away from the Bengali village, unlike the ''Prachi'' river upon whose banks is situated the Kenduli village near Puri. Jayadeva's hymns refer to the ocean using the Sanskrit word "''Mahodadhi''", which is a typical name given to the sea in Puri.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; None of Jayadeva's compositions remotely suggest that he ever served in the court of any monarch. Besides, Lakshman Sena ruled Birbhum between 1179 AD and 1185 AD, that was about a century after the birth of Jayadeva.

==The Bengali view==
A few earlier accounts by Bengali writers had linked Jayadeva to the famous king of Bengal [[Lakshman Sen]], the fourth ruler of the [[Sena dynasty]] and the last [[Hindu]] ruler of unified [[Bengal]].
These views originated from a single Bengali book, ''Jayadeva Charita'' authored by Odia poet called ''Banamali Das'', then subsequently disseminated by Bengali historians. The book was written in 1803 when little was known about the poet's life.  Since this was the only published source of information then, it eventually came to be accepted that Jayadeva may have been born in Bengal. This idea was further propagated in 1906 through an article by a certain M. M. Chakrobarty where he mentioned that the great poet belonged to Bengal in the ''Asiatic Society of Bengal''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IEQ20070602222030&amp;Page=Q&amp;Title=ORISSA&amp;Topic=0
|title=Poet Jaydev belonged to Orissa: Bengal scholar
|date=6-3-2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Jayadeva mentions the village of ''Kendubilva'' as his birthplace, a location in Birbhum, where a traditional Baul festival is held each year, was identified to have been the original ''Kenduli'' village of Jayadeva. Under the assumption that the illustrious poet was born there, that festival too became associated with Jayadeva. A nearby village acquired the sobriquet of "Jayadeva Kenduli" and became a tourist attraction, and the Baul festival was renamed as "Jayadeva Mela"
Jayadeva lived for a long time in Navadwip during the reign of the king of Bengal, Lakshman Sen, making his home not far from the king's palace. At that time, the king's chief scholar was Govardhan Acharya. According to Ashutosh Deb's Bengali dictionary, Jayadeva was Lakshman Sen's court poet.
 
Shrila Bhaktivinoda Thakur writes in his Navadvipa-dhama-mahatmya that Lakshman Sen was delighted when he heard Jayadeva's hymn to the ten incarnations, the Dasavatara-stotra. When Govardhan Acharya notified the king that it was Jayadeva who had composed the hymn, he became desirous to meet the poet. He went incognito to Jayadeva's house and when he saw him, he noticed that Jayadeva possessed all the characteristics of a great and powerful spiritual personality.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.hindubooks.org/temples/bengal/birbhum/page2.htm
|title=The temples of Birbhum
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of having originated centuries later during the time of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]]. Also The Krishna worshipping was prevailing in Bengal from long time before Sri Chaitanya.In the Gaudiya Vaishnava Abhidhana, it is stated that Jayadeva found his Radha Madhava Deities in this river's waters. It is also stated there that he used to rest and worship at the Temple of Shiva known as Kusheshwar, which is also on the banks of the Ajaya River.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/web1/03nov14/national.htm#1
|title=Scholars provide new twist to Jayadev birth controversy
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Jayadeva's composition, including the Gita Govinda clearly were composed in Puri in Odisha, Bengali historians who supported the idea that Jayadeva must have been from that state, went on to explain that the poet eventually settled in Puri in that state where he began composing poetry.

==The ''Kaun Banega Crorepati'' faux pas==
In spite of Jayadeva's proven birthplace in [[Kenduli Sasan]], near Puri in [[Odisha]], the April 16, 2007 episode of the popular Indian TV game show ''[[Kaun Banega Crorepati]]'' (KBC III) mentioned Jayadeva as the court poet of king Lakshmanasena of Bengal. This triggered an immediate volley of protests by the culture-aware people of Odisha.  Shah Rukh Khan, the game show's host was denounced for spreading false information.  The government of Odisha has also demanded an apology from ''Kaun Banega Crorepati'' as it claims that the game show "mutilated historical facts" and "hurt the feelings of the people of Odisha".&lt;ref&gt;

==Postage stamps commemorating Jayadeva's birth in Odisha==
In July 2009, the government of India's Department of Posts has decided to release 11 stamps in Bhubaneswar to commemorate the birth of Jayadeva. One stamp depicts the poet himself, while the other ten show the 10 incarnations of [[Vishnu]], or [[Dasavatara]], that the poet popularized in his epic poem, the [[Gita Govinda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Monaco depuis since 1861.png|thumb|500px|Land reclamation in Monaco since 1861]]
'''Land reclamation''' is done '''in [[Monaco]]'''  because land is very scarce, as the nation is comparatively tiny, at 0.78 [[Mile|mi²]] (2.02 [[Kilometer|km²]]). To solve this problem and continue economic development, for years the country has been adding to its total land area by reclaiming land from the sea.

==Geography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
The entire district of [[Fontvieille, Monaco|Fontvieille]] was constructed on land reclaimed from the sea in the 1970s. It is the newest of the four traditional quartiers (districts) in the principality of Monaco, and one of ten Wards for modern administrative purposes. It is located in the western part of Monaco.

Land has also been added to areas of [[La Condamine]] and [[Larvotto|Larvotto/Bas Moulins]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
[[Prince Albert II|Prince Albert's]] father, [[Rainier III]], was known as the "Builder Prince". In an attempt to further develop the economy of Monaco, he first supported the idea of [[land reclamation]]. Since it was impossible to extend into France, the only solution was to reclaim land from the sea. First, the Larvotto beach district was created in the early 1960s, then the Fontvieille industrial area, increasing the principality's surface area by approximately 20 percent. More recently, [[Port Hercules]] has been extended to welcome larger cruise ships on one side, and to provide land for a new Yacht Club on the other.

==Projects==
Prince Albert II is currently planning to reclaim even more land. He intends to build into the [[Mediterranean]] to create a new area about 5 hectares (12.5 acres) in size. The new district will extend from the Fontvieille district at the western foot of the [[Rock of Monaco]], where Monaco's palace and historic centre are situated. The project will cost an estimated €11 billion. It was suspended in 2009 due to the global financial crisis and the prince's concerns regarding the marine environment. However, the project was resumed in 2010 and is expected to be completed by 2014.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web|title=Monaco to reclaim land from the sea|url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/monaco-to-reclaim-land-from-the-sea-1990724.html|publisher=Independent.ie|accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
Monaco's coastline on the Mediterranean is already a fragile and vulnerable environment. Any further land reclamation projects threaten to disturb or damage the coastal ecosystem. Monaco's leaders have approached the prospect of further land reclamation with caution and have stated that new projects would have to meet strict environmental standards to limit damage to flora and wildlife. Due to the concerns that land reclamation could potentially damage local marine ecosystems, Prince Albert II has insisted the entire expansion be placed on stilts, like an oil rig, in order to disturb the sea floor as little as possible.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

The '''Lisbon Naval Base''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Base Naval de Lisboa''), is the main installation and [[naval base|operational base]] of the [[Portuguese Navy]]. Being located at the former Royal Estate of Alfeite on the south bank of the [[Tagus river]]'s huge [[estuary]], near the city of [[Almada]], the installation is sometimes referred to as the '''Alfeite Naval Base'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arsenal-alfeite.pt/historia History of the Alfeite Arsenal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Portuguese [[Naval fleet]] [[warship|ships]] are based at Alfeite, as well as many of its administrative, training and support services. Within its perimeter are also located the [[Portuguese Naval School|Naval School]], the Naval Technologies School, the Alfeite Arsenal, the [[Portuguese Marine Corps|Marine corps Base]] and other Portuguese Navy units.{{fact|date=July 2014}} 

The Lisbon Naval Base is an administrative entity that – besides the main naval station at Alfeite – manages several other smaller naval facilities in the region.{{fact||date=July 2014}}

==History==
[[Lisbon]] and the neighbor Tagus estuary has always been the largest and most important [[naval base]] of [[Portugal]], since the 12th century.{{fact||date=July 2014}} During the [[Age of Discovery]], in the 15th and 16th centuries, Lisbon and the Tagus became the major naval base in the World. It was from this base, that [[Vasco da Gama]] set out to discover the sea route to [[India]].

Until after [[World War I]], in reality there was not a single naval base, but a series of smaller bases located at various points of both banks of the Tagus.{{fact||date=July 2014}} Among others, in the early 20th century, there was the Lisbon Navy Arsenal, the [[Santa Maria de Belém|Doca de Belém]] [[submarine]] base, the [[Portuguese Naval Aviation|Bom Sucesso]] [[seaplane]] base, the [[Vila Franca de Xira]] [[destroyer]] base, the Vale do Zebro [[torpedo boat]] base, the [[Alcântara (Lisbon)|Alcântara]] Naval Barracks and the Doca da Marinha naval [[quay]]. 

In the late 19th century, the idea of building a new [[arsenal|naval arsenal]] at the site of the Royal Estate of Alfeite arose.{{fact||date=July 2014}} Several senior naval officers also began to advocate the idea of concentrating the several Navy facilities in Lisbon and the Tagus, at a single location near the future new arsenal. 

Construction of the new naval arsenal began in 1928 and was completed in 1937.{{fact||date=July 2014}} Considered one of the largest and best equipped installations of its kind, the Alfeite Arsenal started full operation in 1938. A large naval complex – known as "the city of the Navy" – was built concurrently, to accommodate most of the ships, personnel and services of the Portuguese Navy. These were successively transferred to Alfeite up until the 1950s.

On 3 December 1958, the '' Intendência de Marinha do Alfeite'' {Naval Administration Headquarters at Alfeite} became the Lisbon Naval Base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Noticias de Portugal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=igVPAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22%20Intend%C3%AAncia%20de%20Marinha%20do%20Alfeite%22|year=1958|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language]] '''placenames in the [[Falkland Islands]]'''.  Most of the Spanish language names are quite different in origin to their English equivalents, and many have religious resonances.  Some names were given by the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] ''[[conquistador]]es'', while others were given later by the [[Argentina|Argentine]] government.

The Spanish names are almost never used by residents of the islands themselves, and some, such as [[Falkland Islands|Malvinas]] and [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Puerto Argentino]], may be considered offensive by them due to their association with the [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.info/background/99agree.html|title=AGREEMENT OF 14th JULY 1999|publisher=Falklands.info|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a declaration issued jointly following the 1999 agreement lifting travel restrictions to the islands, Argentina undertook to review the Argentine place names for Falkland Island locations, imposed under decree by General Galtieri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.gov.fk/international-relations.php|title=International Relations|publisher=Falkland Islands Government|accessdate=2008-05-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408225447/http://www.falklands.gov.fk/international-relations.php|archivedate=8 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, to date, Argentina still continues to use these placenames to the frustration of the islanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.info/history/99implent.html#passport|title=AGREEMENT OF 14th JULY 1999|publisher=falklands.info|accessdate=2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are not generally in use as Spanish names, rather they are names conferred by an Argentine Government committee where there is no Spanish language equivalent.

The Falkland Islands take their name from the [[Falkland Sound]], a [[strait]] separating the archipelago's two main islands.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p = 73}} The name "Falkland" was applied to the channel by [[John Strong (mariner)|John Strong]], captain of an English expedition, which landed on the islands in 1690. Strong named the strait in honour of [[Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount of Falkland]], the [[Treasurer of the Navy]] who sponsored their journey.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{harvnb|Dotan|2010|p = 165}},
* {{harvnb|Room|2006|p = 129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Viscount's title originates from the town of [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]], Scotland, whose name comes from "folkland" (land held by [[Anglo-Saxon law#Folk-right and privilege|folk-right]]).{{sfn|Room|2006|p = 129}} The name was not applied to the islands until 1765, when [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] captain [[John Byron]] of the [[Royal Navy]], claimed them for [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] as "Falkland's Islands".&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{harvnb|Paine|2000|p = 45}},
* {{harvnb|Room|2006|p = 129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Falklands" is a standard abbreviation used to refer to the islands.

The Spanish name for the archipelago, ''Islas Malvinas'', derives from the French ''Îles Malouines''&amp;nbsp;— the name given to the islands by [[Kingdom of France|French]] explorer [[Louis-Antoine de Bougainville]] in 1764.{{sfn|Hince|2001|p = 121}} Bougainville, who founded the islands' first settlement, named the area after the port of [[Saint-Malo]] (the point of departure for his ships and colonists).&lt;ref&gt;See:
* {{harvnb|Hince|2001|p = 121}},
* {{harvnb|Room|2006|p = 129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The port, located in the [[Brittany]] region of western France, was in turn named after [[Malo (saint)|St. Malo]] (or Maclou), the Christian [[Evangelism|evangelist]] who founded the city.{{sfn|Balmaceda|2011|loc = Chapter 36}}

At the twentieth session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], the [[United Nations Fourth Committee|Fourth Committee]] determined that, in all languages other than Spanish, all UN documentation would designate the territory as ''Falkland Islands (Malvinas)''. In Spanish, the territory was designated as ''Islas Malvinas (Falkland Islands)''.{{sfn|Foreign Office|1961|p = 80}} The nomenclature used by the United Nations for statistical processing purposes is ''Falkland Islands (Malvinas)''.&lt;ref name="std_name"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49alpha.htm | title= Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications | publisher=United Nations Statistics Division | date=13 February 2013 | accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few names have the same form in both [[English language|English]] and Spanish; for example [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]], [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]], [[Salvador Settlement|Salvador]] and [[Rincon Grande]].

Inclusion of ''The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'' is unique since it contains three previously released featurettes, and thus is technically a compilation film.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note" name="live-action"&gt;These films contain live-action scenes and/or sequences.&lt;/ref&gt;

COLOR CALCULATION FORMULA
The aim of this formula is to generate a color in the Green→Yellow→Red spectrum.
Score of 0 is red. 25 is orange. 50 gives yellow. 75 gives lime. 100 gives green.

To use the formula, replace SCORE with a number between 0 and 100:

  {{Lighten|{{Min|(100-SCORE)*5.1|255}}|{{Min|SCORE*5.1|255}}|0|70}}"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18698">This is a '''list of all present [[sovereign state]]s in [[North America]] and their predecessors'''. The division between North and South America is unclear, generally viewed as lying somewhere in the [[Isthmus of Panama]], however, the [[Caribbean Islands]], [[Central America]] including the whole of [[Panama]] is considered to be part of North America as its southernmost nation. The continent was [[Colony|colonized]] by the [[European colonization of the Americas|Europeans]]: Mainly by the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spaniards]], the [[French colonization of the Americas|French]], the [[English colonization of the Americas|English]] and the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]]. [[United States of America]] gained its independence in [[American Revolutionary War]]; Most of nations in [[Central America]] gained [[Latin American wars of independence|independence]] in the early [[19th century]]; Canada and many other island countries in the [[Caribbean Sea]] (most of them were British colonies) gained their independence in [[20th century]]. Today, North America consists of twenty-two sovereign states with common government system being some form of [[Presidential system|presidential republic]].

*'''[[Zvíkov Castle]]''': Until 1597 there are stories about a Zvíkovský Rarášek (Rarach is a supernatural being common in Slavic folklore, similar to an imp or trickster) which haunts people in the ancient tower, Markomanka. This tower has stones engraved with unknown symbols, and was built during the [[Marcomanni]] rule over [[Bohemia]], in the 1st century BC and 2nd century AD. It was integrated into Zvíkov castle hundreds of years later. Weird events occur here frequently, including weird photos, technical problems, unpredictable behaviour of animals, spontaneous extinguishing of fires, electromagnetic anomalies, and the presence of ghosts. In Czech media it's a popular subject of investigation. Other areas of the castle are also haunted; it is said to be dangerous to sleep in the main tower, with anyone who does dying within a year. Another monster common in Czech culture, [[fire hound]]s are also part of the myths surrounding the castle. It is said that these spectral dogs (in some accounts they are depicted with burning eyes) are guarding a hidden tunnel underneath Zvíkov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Galileo Corporation s.r.o. |url=http://www.hrad-zvikov.eu/points-of-interest/hliza-tower/ |title=Oficiální stránky hradu Zvíkov - Hlíza tower |publisher=Hrad-zvikov.eu |date= |accessdate=26 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325192456/http://www.hrad-zvikov.eu/points-of-interest/hliza-tower/ |archivedate=25 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castlesandmanorhouses.com/summary.php?Category=Visit&amp;Type=%28All+Properties%29&amp;Country=%28All+Countries%29&amp;Parameter=ByCountry |title=List of (All Properties) to Visit in (All Countries) |publisher=Castlesandmanorhouses.com |date= |accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blesk.cz/clanek/celebrity/10200/zvikovsky-rarasek-trapi-filmare.html |title=Zvíkovský rarášek trápí filmaře |publisher=Blesk.cz |date= |accessdate=26 March 2014 |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tajemnamista.cz/magazin/64-zvikovska-vez-markomanka-dodnes-vyhrozuje-smrti |title=Zvíkovská věž Markomanka: Dodnes vyhrožuje smrtí! |publisher=Tajemná místa |date= |accessdate=26 March 2014 |language=Czech |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327234202/http://www.tajemnamista.cz/magazin/64-zvikovska-vez-markomanka-dodnes-vyhrozuje-smrti |archivedate=27 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paranormal.komis-site.eu/zvikov-tajemna-vez-markomanka/ |title=Zvíkov – Tajemná věž Markomanka « Paranormal |publisher=Paranormal.komis-site.eu |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=26 March 2014 |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Montpelier Hill]]''': The Stewards House, or Killakee House, was built around 1765 by the Conolly family as a hunting lodge. The house has a reputation for being haunted. Stories tell of a particularly large ghostly [[black cat]]. The best documented account occurred between 1968 and 1970 when the ''[[Evening Herald]]'' and ''[[Evening Press]]'' newspapers carried a number of reports regarding a Mrs. Margaret O'Brien and her husband Nicholas, a retired [[Garda Síochána|Garda]] [[superintendent (police)|superintendent]], who were converting the house into an arts centre. During the conversion, tradesmen employed on the work site began complaining of ghosts. One night, a friend of the O'Briens, artist Tom McAssey, and two workmen were confronted by a spectral figure and a black cat with glowing red eyes. McAssey painted a portrait of the cat which hung in the house for several years afterwards. Although locals were skeptical of the reports, further apparitions were reported, most notably that of an Indian gentleman, and of two nuns called Blessed Margaret and Holy Mary who had taken part in black masses on Montpelier Hill. There were also reports of incorporeal ringing bells and [[poltergeist]] activity. In 1970, an [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] television crew recorded a documentary about the house. In the documentary, a [[clairvoyant]] called Sheila St. Clair communicated with the spirits of the house through [[automatic writing]]. In 1971, a plumber working in the house discovered a grave with a skeleton of a small figure, most likely that of a child or, perhaps, the body of the dwarf alleged to have been sacrificed by the members of the Hell Fire Club. The house operated as a restaurant in the 1990s before closing in 2001; it is now a private residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Farrell |first=Padraic |title=Irish Ghost Stories |year=2004 |publisher=Gill &amp; Macmillan |location=Dublin |isbn=978-0-7171-3633-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walsh |first=Dave |title=Haunted Dublin |year=2008 |publisher=Nonsuch Publishing |location=Dublin |isbn=978-1-84588-932-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh_21"&gt;Walsh, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the priest of the temple learned this, he had the [[heart sutra]] painted on every part of Hoichi's body apart from his ears.

This is a [[list of places where social nudity is practised]] in North America for recreation. As a philosophy, this practice is commonly referred to as [[naturism]]; the International Naturist Federation has affiliates in over 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inffni.org |title=International Naturist Federation |publisher=Inffni.org |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most who indulge in this activity are likely not formal members of a naturist organization. This listing includes free beaches (clothing-optional beaches or [[nude beaches]]) and some private resorts.

===British Columbia===
British Columbia has thousands of kilometres of coastline and thousands of lakes, as well as millions of hectares of natural parks and undeveloped land. The vast majority of these areas are mostly uninhabited and nude swimming and sunbathing can be done with little concern for disturbing others. In the populated areas, particularly the [[Lower Mainland]], [[Greater Victoria]], and the [[Okanagan]], nudity is generally practiced only in certain established or isolated locations (usually beaches) and on private properties.

* Female toplessness is allowed throughout the state in a nonsexual context, since Oregon's law says that public nudity is only prohibited if there is a deliberate intention to induce sexual excitement among people, and although a few cities across the state ([[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]] and [[Happy Valley, Oregon|Happy Valley]]) have prohibited the public exposure of the genitals, women are still allowed to go topless in public even in these cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women can bare it all in the Rose City|url=http://psuvanguard.com/women-can-bare-it-all-in-the-rose-city/|publisher=Vanguard|accessdate=28 December 2017|date=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public nudity in Oregon: Where you can and can't legally be naked in the open|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/06/public_nudity_in_oregon.html/|publisher=The Oregonian|accessdate=28 December 2017|date=June 29, 2015|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817172139/http://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/06/public_nudity_in_oregon.html/|archive-date=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vermont===
Vermont state law prohibits disrobing in public but does not prohibit public nudity, so nudity is allowed anywhere that it has not been specifically prohibited by a city or town. The city of [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], for example, has prohibited nudity in public parks, but nudity is allowed anywhere else in the city.&lt;ref name="nakedinvermont"&gt;[http://www.nakedinvermont.com/library/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=6&amp;id=37&amp;artlang=en]{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific locations at which individuals practice social nudity include:

* The [[West River (Vermont)|West River]] in [[Dummerston, Vermont|Dummerston]] has several good private spots for nude sun bathing and swimming. Particularly, the Sugar Hill beach just north of Maple Valley Ski Area (now closed) is a great spot. Although it is good to ask before disrobing, first, if clothed people are present.
* The Rock River in [[Newfane, Vermont|Newfane]] off route 30 has a series of swimming holes.  After the first clothed family swimming hole the rest are nude for families, mixed men and women, and finally gay men.  River access is curated by Rock River Preservation Inc.&lt;ref name="rock_"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Stewardship Agreement Signed With Property Owner | author =  | work = Rock River Preservation, Inc. | date = n.d. | accessdate = 2018-06-06 | url = http://www.rockriverpreservation.org/ | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Southwest Cove at [[Lake Willoughby]] in the town of [[Westmore, Vermont|Westmore]] is a traditionally clothing-optional beach area located on state land. The Westmore selectboard has declined to enact any anti-nudity ordinance. At the annual town meeting in 2009, residents voted against an appropriation that would have enabled enforcement of any proposed anti-nudity ordinance. Thus, the beach remains clothing-optional.
* Maple Glen in [[Sheldon Springs, Vermont|Sheldon Springs]] closed as a family oriented nudist camp in May 2010 due to water quality issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapleglen.net/ |title=Maple Glen, Vermont's Best Kept Secret |publisher=Mapleglen.net |date= |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010 the camp applied for an [[Act 250 (Vermont law)|Act 250]] permit to approve already existing buildings on the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Today In Brief | work=St. Albans Messenger (VT) | date=April 26, 2010 | location=News | pages=1A | quote=SHELDON – Maple Glen, Inc., located on Maple Glen Road in Sheldon has applied for an Act 250 permit to approve the construction of nearly a dozen already existing buildings on the property.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, it was revealed that it would reopen as a non-nudist campground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.samessenger.com/sheldon-partners-plan-to-dress-up-nudist-camp/ |title=SHELDON: Partners plan to dress up nudist camp |last=Reed |first=Elodie |date=August 13, 2014 |publisher=Vermont Publishing Company |newspaper=St. Albans Messenger |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203171902/http://www.samessenger.com/sheldon-partners-plan-to-dress-up-nudist-camp/ |archive-date=December 3, 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Punchbowl on the [[Mad River (Vermont)|Mad River]] between the intersection of [[Vermont Route 17]] in [[Warren, Vermont|Warren]] is a privately owned nude swimming hole, open to anyone. It is on the west side of [[Vermont Route 100|Route 100]], and you need to walk through a short field before encountering signs explaining that there is public nudity, and explaining the guidelines for swimming there. It's mostly just common courtesy, and there is usually a wide array of swimmers, from single men and women to entire families. There are a couple small waterfalls, a couple deep pools, and a small slide to slide down during moderate to high water periods. The water is cool, crystal clear and very refreshing. Swimmers should plan to swim nude, since visitors that swim there in a bathing suit tend to be looked at with some suspicion that they are only there to "observe" the other nude swimmers.

===Washington===
*'''Seattle'''
{{Main|Social nudity in Seattle}}
While [[Seattle]] is known for its [[nude cycling|nude cyclists]], clothing-optional activity in the city and out in public and out in private goes back much farther, with nude and top-free use of areas of [[Magnuson Park]], the [[Washington Park Arboretum]], [[Discovery Park (Seattle)|Discovery Park]], [[Denny-Blaine Park (Seattle)|Denny-Blaine Park]] and Secret Beach (a name given to a park that local users wish to keep a secret). Parks spokeswoman Dewey Potter said the parks department does not consider simply being naked illegal, and she doesn't remember any complaints during the 13 years she's worked for the city about nudity in the parks.

While there is nothing in the Seattle Municipal Code about nudity and expectations of behavior, [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] does have a law protecting against obscene behavior while being fully or partially naked. The act of [[Breastfeeding in public|breastfeeding]] or expressing breast milk is not indecent exposure.

[[File:Malay world map.png|thumb|Countries in red are those most often considered to be part of the Malay world; areas where Malays are either an ethnic majority or significant minority, or where Malay language and culture have historically been influential ([[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Thailand]])|450px]]

The '''Malay world''' or '''Malay realm''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Dunia Melayu'' or ''Alam Melayu'',  [[Jawi script|Jawi]]:  دنيا ملايو or عالم ملايو) is a concept or an expression that has been utilised by different authors and groups over time to denote several different notions, derived from varied interpretations of [[Malayness]], either as a [[Malay race|racial category]], as a [[linguistic group]], or as a political-[[ethnocultural|cultural]] group. The use of the term '[[ethnic Malays|Malay]]' in much of the conceptualisation is largely based on the prevalent [[Malayisation|Malay cultural influence]], manifested in particular through [[linguistic imperialism|the spread of Malay language]] in Southeast Asia as observed by different colonial powers during the [[Age of Discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ooi|2009|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept in its broadest territorial stretch may apply to a region synonymous with [[Austronesia]], homeland to the [[Austronesian people]]s, that extends from [[Easter Island]] in the east to [[Madagascar]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farrer|2009|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such description has its origin in the introduction of the term [[Malay race]] in the late 18th century that has been popularised by the [[orientalism|orientalist]]s to describe the [[Austronesian people]]s. In a narrower sense, the Malay world has been used as a [[Sprachraum]], referring to the Malay-speaking countries and territories of [[Southeast Asia]], where different standards of Malay are the [[national language]]s, or a variety of it is an important minority language. The term in this sense encompasses [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Southern Thailand]], and is sometimes used interchangeably with the concepts of '[[Malay Archipelago]]' and '[[Nusantara]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Amin Sweeney|2011|p=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, modern scholars correct these extended notions of the Malay world, defining it as a political and [[cultural area]] instead. In this context, the Malay world is reduced to a region that is homeland to the [[Malay people]], historically ruled by different [[Malay sultanate]]s, where various [[Malayan languages|Malay dialects]] and cultural values are predominant. This area includes the [[Malay Peninsula]], the coastal areas of [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]], and the smaller islands in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|1982|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin|Chou|2002|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wee|1985|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable use of the concept was in the early 20th century, embraced in an [[irredentism|irredentist]] fashion, by the [[early Malay nationalism|Malay nationalists]] in the form of '[[Greater Indonesia|Greater Malaya]]' (''Melayu Raya''), as an aspiration for the "natural" or desired borders of a modern nation for the [[Malay race]].

|source = — [[Manuel Godinho de Erédia]],1613.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|1923|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohamed Anwar Omar Din|2011|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Territorial identification of Malay is of ancient origin. Various foreign and local records show that ''Melayu'' (Malay) and its similar sounding variants appear to apply as an old toponym to the ancient [[Straits of Malacca]] region in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, the term gradually developed into an [[ethnonym]] throughout the consolidation of [[Melaka Sultanate]] as a regional power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tome Pires]], an apothecary who stayed in Melaka from 1512 to 1515, after the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Portuguese conquest]], explained how the former Melaka classified merchants calling its port into four groups, of which the Malays or ''Melayu'' did not appear in the list, suggesting they were not then regarded as category outside the Melaka itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another term, ''Malayos'' or the 'Sea of Malayu' was espoused by the Portuguese historian, [[Manuel Godinho de Erédia]] to describe areas under Melakan dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andaya|2008|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area covers the [[Andaman Sea]] in the north, the entire [[Straits of Malacca]] in the centre, a part of [[Sunda Strait]] in the south and the western [[South China Sea]] in the east. It was generally described as a [[Muslim]] centre of international trade, with [[Malay language]] as its ''[[lingua franca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohamed Anwar Omar Din|2011|pp=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erédia's description indicates that ''Malayos'' was a geo-religio-sociocultural concept, a concept of geographical unity characterised by the common religious belief and cultural features.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohamed Anwar Omar Din|2011|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An identical term, ''[[Tanah Melayu]]'' (literally 'Malay land') is found in various Malay texts, of which the oldest are dating back to the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohamed Anwar Omar Din|2012|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is frequently mentioned in the ''[[Hikayat Hang Tuah]]'', a well known classical work that began as oral tales associated with the legendary heroes of Melaka Sultanate. ''Tanah Melayu'' in the text is consistently employed to refer to the area under Melakan dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reid|2010|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 16th century, Tomé Pires coins an almost similar term, ''Terra de Tana Malaio'' for the southeastern part of Sumatra, where the deposed Sultan of Melaka, [[Mahmud Shah of Malacca|Mahmud Shah]] established his exiled government.

{{quote box|salign=right|align=left|width=35%
|quote=''"...&amp;nbsp;the country which Europeans denominate the Malay Peninsula, and which, by the natives themselves, is called 'the land of the Malays' ('Tanah Melayu'), has, from its appearing to be wholly occupied by that people, been generally considered as their original country&amp;nbsp;..."''
|source = — [[John Crawfurd]], 1820&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The application of ''Tanah Melayu'' to the [[Malay Peninsula]] entered into the European authorship, when [[William Marsden (orientalist)|Marsden]] and [[John Crawfurd|Crawfurd]] noted it in their historical works published in [[1811]] and 1820 respectively. Another important term, the ''Malaya'', an English term for the Peninsula, was already used in English writings from the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the lack of available research, it is difficult to trace the development of the concept of the Malay world as a term which later refers to the Archipelago. However, above early territorial identifications are believed to have formed an important antecedent for the future conceptualisation of the Malay world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andaya|2008|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malay as a racial category===
{{main|Malay race}}
The broader concept of Malay world has its origin from the conceptualisation of Malay as a race by the German scientist [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]. Blumenbach identified 'Malay' as a subcategory of both the [[Ethiopid race|Ethiopid]] and [[Mongoloid]] races, and expanded the term to include the native inhabitants of the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Maluku Islands|Malukus]], [[Sunda Islands|Sundas]],  [[Indochina]], as well as [[Pacific Island]]s like the [[Tahiti]]ans. This broad conception of Malay was largely derived from the strong presence of [[Malayisation|Malay cultural influence]], particularly in linguistic, throughout the [[Southeast Asia]] at the time of European colonisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ooi|2009|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malay language was one aspect of the prestige of the Malay sultanates, and considered as a language of the learned in Southeast Asia in the 17th and 18th century comments. An 18th century European account even suggests that one is not considered a very broadly educated man in the east, if he don't understand Malay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularisation of Malay as a racial category was in essence a colonial product, the significant role of which played by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] since the 17th century and that of the [[British Empire|British]] since the 18th century in identifying [[Maritime Southeast Asia|the Archipelago]] as the Malay world. The view held by [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] for example, had a significant influence on English-speakers, lasting to the present day. He should probably be regarded as the most important voice in projecting the idea of a 'Malay' race or nation, not limited to the traditional [[Malay rulers|Raja-Raja Melayu]] or even their supporters, but embracing a large if unspecified part of the Archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reid|2001|pp=296–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Marsden (orientalist)|William Marsden]], another British "merchant-scientist," classified the inhabitants of the Archipelago as Malays, based on religion ([[Islam]]), language ([[Malay language|Malay]]) and origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malay territoriality in three tiers===
In the late 19th century, an important innovation was introduced into the political vocabulary of the [[Malay language]]. The word ''kerajaan'', which had in older times usually meant "king," "royalty" and "kingdom," began to be defined as "government". In the same period, the term ''negeri'' was increasingly being used as a word equivalent to "state," in contrast to its earlier use in court texts more in the sense of a 'settlement' than of a political entity. With growing frequency, publications of the 1870s and 1880s employed the term to refer either to individual [[Malay sultanate]]s or any political state in the world beyond the Malay territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British historian, [[Richard James Wilkinson|Wilkinson]], prefers the term "state" to refer to an administrative or territorial unit in the Malay Peninsula in his time, while he uses the word "kingdom" or "sultanate" for a Malay polity of older times. While Wilkinson often uses "the Peninsula" or "the Malay Peninsula," he also calls the Peninsula "[[British Malaya|Malaya]]." His use of the word "Malaya" occasionally includes not merely the Peninsula under British rule but also its other parts under [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese rule]]. In referring to [[Maritime Southeast Asia|the Archipelago]], Wilkinson not only uses "the Archipelago" or "the Indian Archipelago," but also "the Malay world," which might have more sociocultural connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the textbooks available during [[British Malaya|colonial Malaya]], [[Richard Olaf Winstedt|Winstedt]]'s ''Ilmu Alam Melayu'' ('Geography of the Malay world') presents the clearest picture of the territoriality of the Malay community. As expressed in the title, Winstedt attempts to cover most of the Archipelago. He describes not only the British colonies and protectorates in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo, but also the [[Netherlands East Indies]] and the [[Philippines]]. The structure of ''Ilmu Alam Melayu'' shows the three-tiered constitution of the Malay world. The Malay world (''Alam Melayu'') is divided into sub-regions, namely, Malaya (''Tanah Melayu''), the [[British Borneo|British Borneo territories]], the Netherlands East Indies and the Philippines. Malaya, in turn, is made up of the [[Malay states]] (''Negeri-Negeri Melayu''). It is also important to note the standardization of geographical knowledge in this geography textbook. All states in the Peninsula, the main islands and areas of the Netherlands East Indies and all of the Philippines are systematically discussed through the common topics of overview, districts and towns, products, inhabitants and history. Such a systematic and comprehensive catalogue of geographical knowledge helps to convey an image of the Malay world as a territorial entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soda|2001|pp=213–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malay historian Abdul Hadi Haji Hassan, who cites Winstedt's textbooks in his ''Sejarah 'Alam Melayu'' ('History of the Malay world'), had much in common with Winstedt's view of the Malay world. For Abdul Hadi, too, the Malay territories are made up of the Malay states, Malaya and the Malay world. Of the 12 chapters in the three volumes of Abdul Hadi's textbook, four chapters focus on the history of the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] in Malaya, while other chapters deal with the history of the Malays in both Malaya and other parts of the Malay world. It ought to be added that the history of each colony or state (''negeri'') in the [[Straits Settlements]] and the [[Federated Malay States]] is explained in the fourth and the fifth volumes of the book written by another Malay historian, [[Buyong Adil]] in 1934 and 1940. Thus, both British and Malay authors conceptualised Malay territoriality in three tiers, that is, the [[Malay states]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and the Malay world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malay nationalism===
{{main|Malay nationalism}}
The standardisation of geographical knowledge and systematic quantification, served to objectify the territoriality of the Malay community. Early authors in Malaya also developed a Malaya-centric view on the subject, proclaiming Malaya or ''Tanah Melayu'' as the focal point of the Malay territories. This view reflected the substantialisation of the colonial territorial boundary and provided new objectification of space seems to have played an important role in conceiving a potential national territory. It is probable that these three territorial identities, namely, Malay states, Malaya and the Malay world had much to do with the strands of [[Malay nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the one hand, in the late 1930s, Malay aristocrats and their supporters began to organize Malay state associations. For them, Malay states were the focus of territorial identity. In postwar Malaya, these state-based Malay associations were dissolved into a Malaya-based Malay political party, that is, the [[United Malays National Organisation]]. Their territorial identity was gradually shifted from Malay states to Malaya or ''[[Persekutuan Tanah Melayu|Tanah Melayu]]''. On the other hand, in the late 1930s, some Malay non-aristocrat intellectuals formed a pan-Malay-oriented association, that is, [[Kesatuan Melayu Muda]] or Young Malay Union. As shown by its President, [[Ibrahim Hj Yaacob]], the territorial stretch of their imagined homeland covered the Malay world or the [[Malay Archipelago]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Soda|2001|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern conception==
Although the extended notions of Malay world still gained widespread currency, particularly in Malaysia, Singapore and the English-speaking world, such conceptualisation is sometimes described in other terms, perceived as more 'neutral', like [[Nusantara]], [[Indonesian archipelago]], and [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. New approaches have also been taken by modern authors to redefine the 'Malay world', by taking into account the historic political pattern of the region, in addition to the existing racial-linguistic spread model.

In this context, modern authors in Malay studies like [[Anthony Milner (historian)|Anthony Milner]], Geoffrey Benjamin, and Vivienne Wee provide a narrower definition, reducing the concept into a political and [[cultural area]]. Benjamin for example, describes the concept in an historically responsive manner to refer to the areas currently or formerly falling under ''Kerajaan Melayu'' ('Malay kingdoms'), the rule of a Malay king. It does not refer to [[Insular Southeast Asia]] at large, and certainly not the [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]]-speaking world as a whole, both of which are usages of Malay world that have crept into scholarly discourse. In this sense, the Malay world refers to various kingdoms and their attendant hinterlands that have existed or still exist along the coasts of [[Brunei]], the east coast of [[Sumatra]] and on the [[Malay peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin|Chou|2002|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This limited conceptualisation of Malay world was also espoused by Wee. She added further, that the concept is a spatial configuration that resulted from the serial patterning of political alliances, unified by ''[[Sejarah Melayu]]'', that is a particular genealogical tree of kingship. The other, non-Malay areas would be those where the rulers did not claim to belong to this particular genealogical tree. For example, [[Aceh]] is located on the northern tip of the Sumatran mainland, yet the rulers evidently did not claim to belong to the Malay genealogical tree. And indeed Aceh is generally not regarded as part of ''Alam Melayu''. On the contrary, both the indigenous and foreign texts indicate that Aceh, similar to [[Java]], was an historical enemy of ''Alam Melayu''. Hence to locate oneself within ''Alam Melayu'' is to claim membership in a specific network of political alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wee|1985|pp=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metageography''' is a term used by [[Martin W. Lewis]] and [[Kären E. Wigen]]'s 1997 ''The Myth of Continents: A Critique of Metageography'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |author2=Kären E. Wigen |title=The Myth of Continents: a Critique of Metageography |year=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |ISBN=0-520-20742-4 |pages=35 |chapter= |quote= }} (hardcover; {{ISBN|0-520-20743-2}} paperback)&lt;/ref&gt;  which analyzes metageographical constructs such as "East", "West", "Europe", "Asia", "North" or "South". which they define as "the set of spatial structures through which people order their knowledge of the world" Geographies, wrote one reviewer, are thus much more than just the ways in which societies are stretched across the earth's surface. They also include the "contested, arbitrary, power-laden, and often inconsistent ways in which those structures are represented epistemologically."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africa.ufl.edu/asq/v1/4/7.htm Book review by Barney Warf, African Studies Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Martin explained: "By 'metageography' I mean the relatively unexamined and often taken-for-granted spatial frameworks through which knowledge is organized within all fields of the social sciences and humanities." He added that "the distinction between the merely geographical and the metageographical is not always clear-cut.&lt;ref&gt;Leonhardt van Efferink [http://www.exploringgeopolitics.org/interview_lewis_martin_metageographies_postmodernism_fallacy_of_unit_comparability_historical_spatial_ideological_development_constructs_taxonomy_ideas_systems/ Martin Lewis: Metageographies, postmodernism and fallacy of unit comparability] ''Exploring Geopolitics'' August 2010 (Accessed 05/01/2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Soviet geographers Gokhman, Gurevich and Saushkin wrote that "[m]etageography is concerned with study of the common basis of geographical regularities and the potentialities of geography as a science"  and argued that many factors must be taken into account in order to define geographical entities, not simply spatial ones.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution''' is a term used to describe pollution resulting from many diffuse sources, in direct contrast to [[point source pollution]] which results from a single source. Nonpoint source pollution generally results from land runoff, precipitation, atmospheric deposition, drainage, seepage, or hydrological modification (rainfall and snowmelt) where tracing pollution back to a single source is difficult.&lt;ref name="epa-nps-overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/what-nonpoint-source |title=What is Nonpoint Source? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-05-02 |website=Polluted Runoff |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-point source water pollution affects a water body from sources such as polluted [[surface runoff|runoff]] from [[agricultural]] areas draining into a river, or wind-borne [[debris]] blowing out to sea. Non-point source air pollution affects air quality from sources such as [[smokestack]]s or car [[tailpipe]]s. Although these pollutants have originated from a point source, the long-range transport ability and multiple sources of the pollutant make it a non-point source of pollution. Non-point source pollution can be contrasted with [[point source (pollution)|point source pollution]], where discharges occur to a body of water or into the atmosphere at a single location.

NPS may derive from many different sources with no specific solution may change to rectify the problem, making it difficult to regulate. Non point source water pollution is difficult to control because it comes from the everyday activities of many different people, such as lawn [[fertilizer|fertilization]], applying [[pesticide]]s, [[road construction]] or [[building construction]].&lt;ref name="tceq-nps"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tceq.texas.gov/waterquality/nonpoint-source/mgmt-plan/index.html |title=Management Program for Nonpoint Source Water Pollution |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-08-22 |publisher=Texas Commission on Environmental Quality |location=Austin, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the leading cause of water pollution in the United States today, with polluted runoff from agriculture and [[hydromodification]] the primary sources.&lt;ref name="EPA-2004-wq-report"&gt;{{cite report |date=January 2009 |title=National Water Quality Inventory: Report to Congress; 2004 Reporting Cycle |url=https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/2004-national-water-quality-inventory-report-congress |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-R-08-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} &lt;ref name="EPA-agmm"&gt;{{cite report |date=July 2003 |title=National Management Measures to Control Non-point Source Pollution from Agriculture |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/national-management-measures-control-nonpoint-source-pollution-agriculture |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-03-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other significant sources of runoff include [[habitat destruction|habitat modification]] and [[silviculture]] (forestry).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |date=July 2007 |title=National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Hydromodification |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/hydromodification-and-habitat-alteration-national-management-measures |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-07-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=May 2005 |title=National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Forestry |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/national-management-measures-control-nonpoint-source-pollution-forestry |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-B-05-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contaminated stormwater washed off parking lots, roads and highways, and lawns (often containing [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s) is called [[urban runoff]]. This runoff is often classified as a type of NPS pollution. Some people may also consider it a point source because many times it is channeled into municipal storm drain systems and discharged through pipes to nearby [[surface water]]s. However, not all urban runoff flows through [[storm drain]] systems before entering water bodies. Some may flow directly into water bodies, especially in developing and suburban areas. Also, unlike other types of point sources, such as industrial discharges, [[sewage treatment]] plants and other operations, pollution in urban runoff cannot be attributed to one activity or even group of activities. Therefore, because it is not caused by an easily identified and regulated activity, urban runoff pollution sources are also often treated as true non-point sources as municipalities work to abate them.

==Principal types==
[[Image:Runoff of soil &amp; fertilizer.jpg|thumb|[[Surface runoff|Runoff]] of [[soil]] and [[fertilizer]] during a rain storm]]

===Sediment===
[[Sediment]] (loose [[soil]]) includes [[silt]] (fine particles) and [[suspended solids]] (larger particles). Sediment may enter surface waters from eroding stream banks, and from [[surface runoff]] due to improper plant cover on urban and rural land.&lt;ref name="IAfact"&gt;Iowa State University. University Extension. Ames, IA. [http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/EDC232A.pdf "Iowa Fact Sheet: Agriculture and Water Quality."] October 2001. Document No. EDC232a.&lt;/ref&gt; Sediment creates [[turbidity]] (cloudiness) in water bodies, reducing the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged [[aquatic plants]] and consequently affect species which are dependent on them, such as [[fish]] and [[shellfish]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |last1=Stevenson |first1=J. Court |last2=Piper |first2=Catherine B. |last3=Confer |first3=Nedra |date=1979 |title=Decline of Submerged Plants in Chesapeake Bay |url=https://www.fws.gov/chesapeakebay/savpage.htm |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |location=Annapolis, MD |access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; High turbidity levels also inhibit drinking [[water purification]] systems.

Sediment can also be discharged from multiple different sources.  Sources include [[construction]] sites (although these are point sources, which can be managed with [[erosion control]]s and [[sediment control]]s), agricultural fields, stream banks, and highly disturbed areas.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"&gt;Penn State University. Pennsylvania Lake Erie NEMO. [http://seagrant.psu.edu/publications/fs/Nonpoint_Source_Pollution.pdf "Nonpoint Source Pollution."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727035540/http://seagrant.psu.edu/publications/fs/Nonpoint_Source_Pollution.pdf |date=2011-07-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrients===
[[File:Nonpoint Source Pollution.svg|thumb|Nonpoint source pollution is caused when precipitation (1) carries pollutants from the ground such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pollutants which come from fertilizers used on farm lands (2) or urban areas (3). These nutrients can cause [[eutrophication]] (4).]]
Nutrients mainly refers to inorganic matter from runoff, [[landfill]]s, [[livestock]] operations and crop lands. The two primary nutrients of concern are phosphorus and nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;Rob Leeds, Larry C. Brown, Nathan L. Watermeier. [https://web.archive.org/web/20020223144636/http://ohioline.osu.edu/aex-fact/0465.html "Food, Agricultural and Biological Engineering."] Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phosphorus]] is a nutrient that occurs in many forms that are [[bioavailable]]. It is notoriously over-abundant in human sewage [[sludge]]. It is a main ingredient in many fertilizers used for agriculture as well as on residential and commercial properties, and may become a [[limiting nutrient]] in freshwater systems and some [[estuaries]]. Phosphorus is most often transported to water bodies via [[soil erosion]] because many forms of phosphorus tend to be [[adsorption|adsorbed]] on to soil particles. Excess amounts of phosphorus in aquatic systems (particularly freshwater lakes, reservoirs, and ponds) leads to proliferation of microscopic algae called [[phytoplankton]]. The increase of organic matter supply due to the excessive growth of the phytoplankton is called [[eutrophication]]. A common symptom of eutrophication is [[algae]] blooms that can produce unsightly surface scums, shade out beneficial types of plants, produce taste-and-odor-causing compounds, and poison the water due to toxins produced by the algae. These toxins are a particular problem in systems used for drinking water because some toxins can cause human illness and removal of the toxins is difficult and expensive. Bacterial decomposition of algal blooms consumes dissolved oxygen in the water, generating [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] with detrimental consequences for fish and aquatic invertebrates.

[[Nitrogen]] is the other key ingredient in fertilizers, and it generally becomes a pollutant in saltwater or brackish estuarine systems where nitrogen is a limiting nutrient. Similar to phosphorus in fresh-waters, excess amounts of bioavailable nitrogen in marine systems lead to eutrophication and algae blooms. Hypoxia is an increasingly common result of eutrophication in marine systems and can impact large areas of estuaries, bays, and near shore coastal waters. Each summer, hypoxic conditions form in [[bottom water]]s where the [[Mississippi River]] enters the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. During recent summers, the aereal extent of this "dead zone" is comparable to the area of [[New Jersey]] and has major detrimental consequences for fisheries in the region.

Nitrogen is most often transported by water as [[nitrate]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The nitrogen is usually added to a watershed as organic-N or [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), so nitrogen stays attached to the soil until [[oxidation]] converts it into nitrate. Since the nitrate is generally already incorporated into the soil, the water traveling through the soil (i.e., [[interflow]] and [[tile drainage]]) is the most likely to transport it, rather than surface runoff.

===Toxic contaminants and chemicals===
Compounds including heavy metals like [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]], and [[cadmium]], organics like [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs) and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), fire retardants, and other substances are resistant to breakdown.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt; These contaminants can come from a variety of sources including human sewage sludge, [[mining]] operations, vehicle emissions, [[fossil fuel]] combustion, urban runoff, industrial operations and landfills.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

Toxic chemicals mainly include [[organic compounds]] and [[inorganic compounds]]. These compounds include pesticides like [[DDT]], acids, and salts that have severe effects to the ecosystem and water-bodies. These compounds can threaten the health of both humans and aquatic species while being resistant to environmental breakdown, thus allowing them to persist in the environment.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt; These toxic chemicals could come from croplands, nurseries, orchards, building sites, gardens, lawns and landfills.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

Acids and salts mainly are inorganic pollutants from irrigated lands, mining operations, urban runoff, industrial sites and landfills.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

===Pathogens===
[[Pathogens]] are bacteria and viruses that can be found in water and cause diseases in humans.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt; Typically, pathogens cause disease when they are present in public drinking water supplies. Pathogens found in contaminated runoff may include:
* ''[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]''
* ''[[Giardia lamblia]]''
* ''[[Salmonella]]''
* ''[[Novovirus|Norovirus]]'' and other [[virus]]es
* [[Parasitic worm]]s (helminths).
[[Coliform bacteria]] and [[fecal matter]] may also be detected in runoff.&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt;  These [[bacteria]] are a commonly used [[indicator bacteria|indicator]] of water pollution, but not an actual cause of disease.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Geological Survey. Reston, VA. [http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs-027-01/ "A Primer on Water Quality."] FS-027-01. March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathogens may contaminate runoff due to poorly managed livestock operations, faulty [[septic system]]s, improper handling of pet waste, the over application of human sewage [[sludge]], contaminated storm sewers, and [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s.&lt;ref name="IAfact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSUNonpoint"/&gt;

==Principal sources==

===Urban and suburban areas===
[[Urban Area|Urban]] and [[Suburban|suburban areas]] are a main sources of nonpoint source pollution due to the amount of runoff that is produced due to the large amount of paved surfaces. Paved surfaces, such as [[asphalt]] and [[concrete]] are impervious to water penetrating them. Any water that is on contact with these surfaces will run off and be absorbed by the surrounding environment. These surfaces make it easier for stormwater to carry pollutants into the surrounding soil.&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). Washington D.C. [http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_pollution/lessons/pollution_tutorial.pdf "Nonpoint Source Pollution"] September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction sites tend to have disturbed soil that is easily eroded by [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] like [[rain]], [[snow]], and [[hail]]. Additionally, discarded debris on the site can be carried away by runoff waters and enter the aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

Typically, in suburban areas, chemicals are used for lawn care. These chemicals can end up in runoff and enter the surrounding environment via storm drains in the city. Since the water in storm drains is not treated before flowing into surrounding water bodies, the chemicals enter the water directly.

===Agricultural operations===
Agricultural operations account for a large percentage of all nonpoint source pollution in the United States. When large tracts of land are [[plow]]ed to grow [[crops]], it exposes and loosens soil that was once buried. This makes the exposed soil more vulnerable to [[erosion]] during [[rainstorm]]s. It also can increase the amount of fertilizer and pesticides carried into nearby bodies of water.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

===Atmospheric inputs===
{{Cite check|section|date=July 2016}}
Atmospheric inputs of pollution into the air can come from multiple sources. Typically, industrial facilities, like [[factory|factories]], emit air pollution via a [[smokestack]]. Although this is a point source, due to the distributional nature, long-range transport, and multiple sources of the pollution, it is considered a nonpoint source. Additionally, atmospheric pollution can become water pollution, by being washed out of the atmosphere in the form of rain or snow.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2016}}

===Highway runoff===
Highway runoff accounts for a small but widespread percentage of all nonpoint source pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, M.K., Agnew, R.W., Gruber, D., and Kreutzberger, W.A., 1981, Constituents of highway runoff, in v. IV, Characteristics of runoff from operating highways—Research report: [https://archive.org/details/constituentsofhi00gupt_1 "Federal Highway Administration Report FHWA/RD–81/045"], 171 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Driscoll, E.D., Shelley, P.E., and Strecker, E.W., 1990, Pollutant loadings and impacts from highway stormwater runoff, v.

I—Technical issues for monitoring highway runoff and urban stormwater: [https://newengland.water.usgs.gov/dev/g1/Reports/FHWA-EP03-054.pdf "Federal Highway Administration Report FHWA–EP–03–054"], p. 3–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granato, G.E., and Cazenas, P.A., 2009, Highway-runoff database (HRDB version 1.0)—A data warehouse and preprocessor for the [[Stochastic Empirical Loading and Dilution Model]]: [https://newengland.water.usgs.gov/dev/g1/DOT/FHWA-HEP-09-004/FHWA-HEP-09-004.pdf "Federal Highway Administration Report FHWA–HEP–09–004"] 57 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, K.P., and Granato, G.E., 2010, Quality of stormwater runoff discharged from Massachusetts highways, 2005–07: [http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2009/5269/ U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2009–5269], 198 p., with CD–ROM.&lt;/ref&gt; Harned (1988) estimated that runoff loads were composed of atmospheric fallout (9%), vehicle deposition (25%) and [[Road#Maintenance|highway maintenance]] materials (67%) he also estimated that about 9 percent of these loads were reentrained in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Harned, D.A., 1988, Effects of Highway Runoff on Streamflow and Water Quality in the Sevenmile Creek Basin, a Rural Area in the Piedmont Province of North Carolina, July 1981 to July 1982: [https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/wsp2329 "U.S. Geological Survey Water-Supply Paper 2329"] 105 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forestry and mining operations===
[[Forestry]] and [[environmental impact of mining|mining]] operations can have significant inputs to non-point source pollution.

====Forestry====
Forestry operations reduce the number of trees in a given area, thus reducing the oxygen levels in that area as well. This action, coupled with the heavy machinery (harvesters, etc.) rolling over the soil increases the risk of [[erosion]].

====Mining====
Active [[mining]] operations are considered point sources, however runoff from abandoned mining operations contribute to nonpoint source pollution. In [[strip mining]] operations, the top of the mountain is removed to expose the desired [[ore]]. If this area is not properly reclaimed once the mining has finished, [[soil erosion]] can occur. Additionally, there can be chemical reactions with the air and newly exposed rock to create acidic runoff. Water that seeps out of abandoned [[underground mining|subsurface mines]] can also be highly acidic. This can seep into the nearest body of water and change the pH in the aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

===Marinas and boating activities===
Chemicals used for boat maintenance, like [[paint]], [[solvent]]s, and [[oil]]s find their way into water through runoff. Additionally, spilling fuels or leaking fuels directly into the water from boats contribute to nonpoint source pollution. Nutrient and bacteria levels are increased by poorly maintained sanitary waste receptacles on the boat and pump-out stations.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

==Control==
{{Main|Agricultural wastewater treatment|Erosion control}}
[[Image:Contour buffer strips NRCS.jpg|thumb|right|Contour [[buffer strip]]s used to retain soil and reduce [[erosion]]]]

===Urban and suburban areas===
To control non-point source pollution, many different approaches can be undertaken in both urban and suburban areas. [[Buffer strip]]s provide a barrier of grass in between impervious paving material like parking lots and roads, and the closest body of water.  This allows the soil to absorb any pollution before it enters the local aquatic system. [[Retention pond]]s can be built in drainage areas to create an aquatic buffer between runoff pollution and the aquatic environment. Runoff and storm water drain into the retention pond allowing for the contaminants to settle out and become trapped in the pond. The use of [[permeable paving|porous pavement]] allows for rain and storm water to drain into the ground beneath the pavement, reducing the amount of runoff that drains directly into the water body. Restoration methods such as [[Constructed wetland|constructing wetlands]] are also used to slow runoff as well as absorb contamination.

Construction sites typically implement simple measures to reduce pollution and runoff. Firstly, sediment or [[silt fence]]s are erected around construction sites to reduce the amount of sediment and large material draining into the nearby water body.  Secondly, laying grass or straw along the border of construction sites also work to reduce nonpoint source pollution.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

In areas served by single-home septic systems, local government regulations can force septic system maintenance to ensure compliance with water quality standards. In [[Washington (state)]], a novel approach was developed through a creation of a "shellfish protection district" when either a commercial or recreational shellfish bed is downgraded because of ongoing nonpoint source pollution. The shellfish protection district is a geographic area designated by a county to protect water quality and tideland resources, and provides a mechanism to generate local funds for water quality services to control nonpoint sources of pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psparchives.com/restore-habs/|title=Restore Habitat|author=|date=10 April 2018|website=Marine|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least two shellfish protection districts in south [[Puget Sound]] have instituted septic system operation and maintenance requirements with program fees tied directly to property taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co.thurston.wa.us/health/ehrp/nisqually.html |title=PHSS HomeA-Z TopicsPrograms/Serv |publisher=Co.thurston.wa.us |date= |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural operations===
To control sediment and runoff, farmers may utilize erosion controls to reduce runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. Common techniques include [[contour plowing]], crop [[mulch]]ing, [[crop rotation]], planting [[perennial]] crops or installing [[riparian buffer]]s.&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 4-95–4-96}}&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Fort Worth, TX. [ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/330.pdf National Conservation Practice Standard: Contour Farming."]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Code 330. June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. [ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/484.pdf National Conservation Practice Standard: Mulching."]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Code 484. September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Conservation tillage]]'' is a concept used to reduce runoff while planting a new crop. The farmer leaves some crop reside from the previous planting in the ground to help prevent runoff during the planting process.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

Nutrients are typically applied to farmland as commercial fertilizer; animal [[manure]]; or spraying of municipal or industrial wastewater (effluent) or sludge. Nutrients may also enter runoff from [[crop residue]]s, [[irrigation]] water, [[wildlife]], and [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|atmospheric deposition]].&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|p. 2–9}} Farmers can develop and implement [[nutrient management]] plans to reduce excess application of nutrients.&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 4-37–4-38}}&lt;ref&gt;NRCS.

August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

To minimize pesticide impacts, farmers may use [[Integrated Pest Management]] (IPM) techniques (which can include [[biological pest control]]) to maintain control over pests, reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, and protect [[water quality]].&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. [ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/595.pdf National Conservation Practice Standard: Pest Management."]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Code 595. July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/factsheets/ipm.htm "Integrated Pest Management Principles."] March 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forestry operations===
With a well-planned placement of both logging trails, also called skid trails, can reduce the amount of sediment generated. By planning the trails location as far away from the logging activity as possible as well as contouring the trails with the land, it can reduce the amount of loose sediment in the runoff. Additionally, by replanting trees on the land after logging, it provides a structure for the soil to regain stability as well as replaces the logged environment.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

===Marinas===
Installing shut off valves on fuel pumps at a marina dock can help reduce the amount of spillover into the water. Additionally, pump-out stations that are easily accessible to boaters in a marina can provide a clean place in which to dispose of sanitary waste without dumping it directly into the water. Finally, something as simple as having trash containers around a marina can prevent larger objects entering the water.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

The country of [[Barbados]] is divided into sub-regions known as [[Parish (administrative division)|parishes]].  

==Terminology==
They are legally styled as the "Parish of ("Parish name") as opposed to the [[United States|American]] naming convention with the name "Parish" coming after the name.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLaws of Barbados, Volume 2|Laws of Barbados, Volume 2]], p.573, 286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barbadosbcassoc.com/Default.asp?Page=5 Barbados Cultural Association of British Columbia - History of Barbados] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612205323/http://www.barbadosbcassoc.com/Default.asp?Page=5 |date=June 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term "parish" derives from the island's religious [[Anglican]] history under the [[Church of England]].  

==History==
This system of parish churches was based on the system that of the Church of England and was the visible expression forming the basis of the parliamentary representation in Barbados. The differing size and shape of each parish were primarily influenced by the large plantation estates of [[cotton]], [[sugar cane]] and [[tobacco]] that existed during the [[Colonialism|colonial]] years of Barbados. As various [[chaples of ease|chapels of ease]] were created during the 17th century across the island, some local churches were elevated to [[Church of England parish church|parish church]] status, leading to the formation of new parishes surrounding those freshly created vestries.

By 1629, the [[England|English]] settlers after landing at [[Holetown|James Town]] formed six original parishes on the island which were:&lt;ref name="Barbados Parliament website"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Barbados Parliament – Parliament History |publisher=Barbados Parliament website |url=http://www.barbadosparliament.com/history.php |accessdate=2007-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523083154/http://www.barbadosparliament.com/history.php |archivedate=May 23, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Parish of [[Christ Church, Barbados|Christ Church]],
*The Parish of [[Saint James, Barbados|St. James]],
*The Parish of [[Saint Lucy, Barbados|St. Lucy]],
*The Parish of [[Saint Michael, Barbados|St. Michael]],
*The Parish of [[Saint Peter, Barbados|St. Peter]], and
*The Parish of [[Saint Thomas, Barbados|St. Thomas]]

By 1645, the land holding of Barbados increased and the shape of the original six were reconfigured giving way to an additional five parishes&lt;ref name="Barbados Parliament website"/&gt; Some prior churches of the state within the existing parishes were elevated to the level of Parish Church and as a consequence they formed new parishes around those new [[vestries]]:
*The Parish of [[Saint Andrew, Barbados|St. Andrew]],
*The Parish of [[Saint George, Barbados|St. George]],
*The Parish of [[Saint John, Barbados|St. John]],
*The Parish of [[Saint Joseph, Barbados|St. Joseph]], and
*The Parish of [[Saint Philip, Barbados|St. Philip]].

Thus Barbados was converted into the current eleven parishes of today.  As was common under the British system, each Parish had a single main [[Parish church|parishional church]] (or [[cathedral]] in the case of Bridgetown having been elevated to city status), which acted as a sort of capital for each parish.&lt;ref name="A to Z"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carrington |first1=Sean |authorlink1= |last2=Fraser |first2=Henry |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=A~Z of Barbados Heritage |trans-title=|url= |format= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2007 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Macmillan Caribbean - Macmillan Publishers Limited Press |location= |isbn=0-333-92068-6 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |trans-chapter=|chapter=Vestry |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Alleyne |first=Warren |year=1978 |title=Historic Bridgetown |publisher=[[Barbados National Trust|The Barbados National Trust]] |location=Barbados}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The parishes each held their own Local Government Councils until these were abolished in 1959, following a brief administrative [[Districts of Barbados|districting experiment]] within Barbados until 1967.&lt;ref name="A to Z"/&gt;

==Today==
{{Map of Barbados}}
The nation's capital [[Bridgetown]], which is located within the parish of [[Saint Michael, Barbados|Saint Michael]], may one day be made into its own district.

Within the country, travel is unrestricted to everyone in moving about from parish-to-parish.  With the rise of urban sprawl and new construction projects across the country many neighbourhoods and even parishional border-lines today are ill-defined.

The eleven parishes are:

The division dates to 1648. The southern Dutch part comprises [[Sint Maarten]] and is one of four constituent countries that form the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The northern French part comprises the [[Collectivity of Saint Martin]] and is an [[overseas collectivity]] of France.

Collectively, the two territories are known as "St-Martin / St Maarten", or sometimes "SXM", the [[IATA]] identifier for [[Princess Juliana International Airport]], the island's main airport.

==Geography==
[[File:Saint-Martin Island topographic map-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Map of Saint Martin]]
Saint Martin has a land area of {{convert|87|km2|abbr=on}}, {{convert|53|km2|abbr=on}} of which is under the sovereignty of France,&lt;ref name=Saint_Martin_land_area /&gt; and {{convert|34|km2|abbr=on}} under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geography St Martin island - locate st martin island in the caribbean - St Martin west indies sxm - tourism board st martin|url=http://www.stmartinisland.org/destination-st-martin/geography-st-martin.html|website=www.stmartinisland.org|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only land border shared by France and the Kingdom of the Netherlands anywhere.

The main cities are [[Philipsburg, Sint Maarten|Philipsburg]] (Dutch side) and [[Marigot, St. Martin|Marigot]] (French side). The Dutch side is more heavily populated. The largest settlement on the entire island is [[Lower Prince's Quarter]], on the Dutch side.

The highest hilltop is the [[Pic Paradis]] ({{convert|424|m}}) in the centre of a hill chain on the French side. Both sides are hilly with large mountain peaks. This forms a valley where many houses are located. There are no rivers on the island, but many dry gullies. Hiking trails give access to the [[dry forest]] covering tops and slopes.

The island is located south of [[Anguilla]], separated from the British territory by the [[Anguilla Channel]]. Saint Martin is northwest of [[Saint Barthélemy]], separated from the French territory by the [[Saint-Barthélemy Channel]]. It is one of the [[Renaissance Islands]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Saint Martin}}

In 1493, explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] (1451–1506), embarked on his second voyage to the [[Americas|New World]] on behalf of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella I]] of [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]]. According to legend, Columbus sighted and perhaps anchored at the island of Saint Martin on November 11, 1493, the feast day of Saint [[Martin of Tours]]. In his honour, Columbus then named the island "San Martin".{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  This name was translated to "Sint Maarten" ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), "Saint-Martin" ([[French language|French]]) and "Saint Martin" in [[English language|English]].

At Columbus' time, St. Martin was populated, if at all, by [[Island Caribs|Carib]] [[amerindian]]s. The former [[Arawaks]] had been chased by the Caribs coming from the north coast of [[South America]] a short time before the arrival of the [[Spaniards]] who followed in Columbus' wake.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The Arawaks were agricultural people who fashioned pottery and whose social organization was headed by hereditary chieftains who derived their power from personal deities called ''zemis''. The Caribs' territory was not completely conquered until the mid-17th century when most of them perished in the struggle between the [[Kingdom of France|French]], [[Kingdom of England|English]] (later [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]), [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Denmark|Danes]] and [[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish]] for control of the [[West Indies]] islands around the [[Caribbean Sea]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The Dutch first began to ply the island's ponds for salt in the 1620s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Despite the Dutch presence on the island, the Spaniards recaptured St. Martin in 1633. One year later, they built a fort (now [[Fort Amsterdam (Sint Maarten)|Fort Amsterdam]], near [[Philipsburg, Sint Maarten|Philipsburg]]) and another [[artillery battery]] at [[Pointe Blanche]] to assert their claim and control access to Great Bay [[Tropical salt pond ecosystem|salt pond]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} A massive influx of [[Africa|African]] slaves{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} took place in the 18th century with the development of [[sugarcane]] plantations by the French and Dutch. Slavery was [[Abolitionism|abolished]] in the first half of the 19th century. On some of their territories the British imported [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and South Asians to take the place of slaves. Thus, St. Martin and the other islands are populated by a mixture of Amerindian, European, African, Indian and Asian peoples.

On 23 March 1648, the [[History of France|Kingdom of France]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] agreed to divide the island between their two territories, with the signing of the [[Treaty of Concordia]]. Folklore surrounds the history of the once ever-changing border division between St. Martin and Sint Maarten, and a popular story among locals narrates that "to divide the island into two sections, [in 1648] the inhabitants were told to choose two walkers, one chosen by the French-dominated community and the other one by the Dutch-dominated community, who were put back to back in one extreme of the island, making them walk in opposite directions while stuck to the littoral line, and not allowing them to run. The point where they eventually met was set as the other extreme of the island, and the subsequently created line was chosen as the frontier, dividing Saint-Martin from Sint Maarten. Seemingly, the French walker had walked more than his Dutch counterpart (they earned their respective lands 54&amp;nbsp;km² and 32&amp;nbsp;km²). The French locals' explanation for this discrepancy is that, as the first man chose wine as his stimulant prior to the race, while the latter chose [[Jenever]] (Dutch Gin), the difference between such beverages' lightness was said to be the cause of the territorial differences. The Dutch locals instead accuse the French walker of running."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/one-island-two-countries/ |title=One Island, Two Countries |date=24 April 2012 |publisher=The New York Times |author=Frank Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewUniversalGeography&gt;{{Cite book

===Hurricane Irma (2017)===
[[File:Hurricane Irma on Sint Maarten (NL) 05.jpg|thumb|Extensive damage to buildings in [[Sint Maarten]] on 7 September 2017, hours after [[Hurricane Irma]] made landfall on the island.]]
On 6 September 2017 the island was hit by [[Hurricane Irma]] ([[Saffir-Simpson Scale#Category 5|Category 5]] at landfall), which caused widespread and significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. A total of 11 deaths had been reported as of 8 September 2017.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/08/caribbean-islanders-fear-another-battering-after-irma-wreaks-havoc|title=Caribbean islanders fear another battering after Irma wreaks havoc|first=Caroline|last=Davies|date=8 September 2017|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/us/destruction-caribbean-irma-florida.html|title=Caribbean Devastated as Irma Heads Toward Florida|first1=Frances|last1=Robles|first2=Kirk|last2=Semple|first3=Vivian|last3=Yee|date=7 September 2017|publisher=|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; France's [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]], [[Gérard Collomb]], said on 8 September 2017 that most of the schools were destroyed on the French half of the island.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Saint Martin}}
[[INSEE]] estimated in 2005 the [[GDP per capita]] of Saint Martin for 1999 to be €14,500 (about USD15,400).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/fr/insee_regions/guadeloupe/themes/comptes_eco/compte/PIB_IDN.pdf Estimation du PIB de Saint-Barthélemy et de Saint-Martin], [[INSEE]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://databank.worldbank.org/ddp/home.do World Development Indicators], [[World Bank]]. Accessed on 30 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main industry of the island is tourism. In 2000, the island had about one million visitors annually. About 85% of the workforce was engaged in the tourist industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rn.html |title=CIA Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
On 1 January 2009 the population of the entire island of Saint Martin was 77,741 inhabitants, 40,917 of whom lived on the Dutch side of the island,&lt;ref name=Sint_Maarten_population /&gt; and 36,824 on the French side.&lt;ref name=Saint_Martin_population /&gt; A local English-based creole language is spoken on both sides of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Holm (1989), ''Pidgins and Creoles'', vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and tourism==
{{Main|Culture of Saint Martin}}

St. Martin's [[Sint Maarten|Dutch side]] is known for its festive nightlife, [[beach]]es, jewellery, [[drink]]s made with native [[rum]]-based [[guavaberry]] [[liquor]]s, and [[casino]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about-saintmartin.com/listcat/casinos |title=Casinos |publisher=about-saintmartin.com |date=17 June 2013 |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island's [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|French side]] is known for its [[nude beach]]es, [[clothes]], [[shopping]] (including outdoor markets), and French and Indian Caribbean cuisine. [[English language|English]] is the most commonly spoken language along with a local [[Netherlands Antilles Creole|dialect]]. The official languages are [[French language|French]] for Saint-Martin, and both [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and English for Sint Maarten. Other common languages include various [[Antillean Creole|French-based creoles]] (spoken by immigrants from other French Caribbean islands), [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (spoken by immigrants from the Dominican Republic and various South American countries), and [[Papiamento]] (spoken by immigrants from Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao).

Among the leading cultural artists of the island are Youth Waves, music band; Isidore "Mighty Dow" York, [[kaiso]]nian, panman; Roland Richardson, [[Impressionist]] painter; Ruby Bute, painter; [[Nicole de Weever]], dancer and Broadway star; [[Lasana M. Sekou]], poet, author, independence advocate; Clara Reyes, choreographer; and Tanny and The Boys, string band music group.

Public buses are the primary mode of transportation for visitors staying on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmartinisland.org/st-martin-st-maarten-travel-information/getting-around-st-martin-island.html#bus |title=Bus transit Saint-Martin |publisher=stmartinisland.org |date=22 June 2015 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traffic on the island has become a major problem. Long traffic jams between Marigot, Philipsburg and the airport are common.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} 

In recent years [[sargassum]] weed has arrived on the south ("Dutch") shoreline, but the northern French coast is generally free of the weed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandcasebeachclub.com/blog/infographic-top-10-faqs-st-martin-sxm/ |title=St. Martin FAQ's |publisher=Grand Case Beach Club |date=1 August 2015 |accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the island is located along the [[intertropical convergence zone]], it is occasionally threatened by [[Atlantic hurricane]] activity in the late summer and early fall.

Neighbouring islands include [[Saint Barthélemy]] (French), [[Anguilla]] (British), [[Saba]] (Dutch), [[Sint Eustatius]] "Statia" (Dutch), [[Saint Kitts]] and [[Nevis]] (independent, formerly British). With the exception of Nevis, all of these islands are easily visible on a clear day from St. Martin.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Shopping==
Shopping on St Maarten and Saint Martin offers duty-free goods in numerous boutiques. Popular goods include local crafts &amp; arts, exotic foods, jewelry, liquor, tobacco, leather goods, as well as most designer goods. Most often the designer goods are offered at significant discounts, often up to 40% lower than EU retail prices.

Saint Martin uses the [[Euro]] as its currency, while Sint Maarten uses the [[Netherlands Antillean guilder]], pegged at 1.79 per US Dollar. As a consequence of the dissolution of the [[Netherlands Antilles]], the Netherlands Antillean guilder will cease to be legal tender and be replaced by the [[Caribbean guilder]] in the coming years. Almost every store on the island also accepts the [[United States dollar]], although sometimes a more expensive exchange rate is used.

==Transport==
[[File:Airport SXM.jpg|thumb|Air France Airbus A340 landing at Princess Juliana International Airport]]

===Border checks===
Neither side of the island is part of the [[Schengen Area]]; full border checks are performed when travelling in and out of the island. Passport controls are also exercised when taking the ferry from Marigot or Princess Juliana International Airport to [[Anguilla]]. There are rarely checks at the border between the two sides of the island. 

In 1994, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and France signed the [[Franco-Dutch treaty on Saint Martin border controls]], which allows for joint Franco-Dutch border controls on so-called "risk flights" arriving from off-island, and only admitting foreigners having permission to travel on both sides of the island. After some delay, the treaty was ratified in November 2006 in the Netherlands, and subsequently entered into force on 1 August 2007. Its provisions are not yet implemented as the working group specified in the treaty is not yet installed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}{{update-inline|date=November 2017}} The treaty requires a working group that has never been set up, to harmonize external checks at the two main airports. The Dutch side has expressed concern that new and tighter French visa requirements would harm their tourism income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about-saintmartin.com/immigration-formalities/ |title=Immigration Formalities |publisher=About-saintmartin.com |date= |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airports===
[[File:SXMDanger.jpg|thumb|Sign warning people that standing too close to the airport fence on [[Maho Beach]] can be dangerous]]

The island is served by many major airlines that daily bring in large jet aircraft, including [[Boeing Commercial Aircraft|Boeing]] [[Boeing 747|747]]s and [[Airbus]] [[Airbus A340|A340]]s carrying tourists from across the world. The short main [[runway]] at [[Princess Juliana International Airport]], and its position between a large hill and a beach, causes some spectacular approaches. [[Plane spotter|Aviation photographers]] flock to the airport to capture pictures of large jets just a few metres above sunbathers on [[Maho Beach]]. Given the destruction brought by Hurricane Irma in 2017, this activity has been almost totally curtailed.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?nr_of_rows=2253&amp;sort_order=views&amp;first_this_page=0&amp;page_limit=15&amp;thumbnails=&amp;a=1&amp;placesearch=Philipsburg%20%2F%20St.%20Maarten%20-%20Princess%20Juliana%20%28SXM%20%2F%20TNCM%29 |title=Aviation Photos: Philipsburg / St. Maarten – Princess Juliana (SXM / TNCM)|website=airliners.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small airport on the French side of the island at [[Grand Case]], [[L'Espérance Airport]] for small aircraft serving neighbouring Caribbean islands. It frequently suffers thick fog during the hurricane season due to its location.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1613">'''Shredding''' is a traditional European method of tree pruning by which all side branches are removed repeatedly leaving the main trunk and top growth. In the Middle Ages the practice was common throughout Europe, but it is now rare, found mainly in central and Eastern Europe.

The purpose of shredding is to allow harvest of firewood and animal fodder while preserving a tall main trunk which may be harvested for timber at a later date.

It was formerly practiced in Britain although [[Oliver Rackham]] notes that "The medieval practice of shredding – cropping the side-branches of a tree leaving a tuft at the top – vanished from Britain long ago. Only at [[Haresfield]] (Gloucestershire) have I seen a few ancient ashes that may once have been shredded".&lt;ref&gt;Rackham, Oliver (1986). ''The History of the Countryside: The full fascinating story of Britain's landscape''. London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons Ltd. {{ISBN|0-460-04449-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another name for cutting side branches off trees, used mainly in Northern England, is '''snagging'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jones, Melvin|title=Aspects of Sheffield: Discovering Local History|year=1997|publisher=Wharncliffe Publishing|page=67|ISBN=1-871647-40-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other similar woodland management techniques include [[pollarding]] and [[coppicing]].

[[File:2013_Fertility_per_woman_world_map.jpg|thumb|Total fertility rate as of 2013]]
'''Sub-replacement fertility''' is a [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) that (if sustained) leads to each new [[generation]] being less populous than the older, previous one in a given area.  In [[developed countries]] sub-replacement fertility is any rate below approximately 2.1 children born per woman, but the threshold can be as high as 3.4 in some developing countries because of higher [[mortality rate]]s.&lt;ref name= variation&gt;{{cite journal |title=The surprising global variation in replacement fertility |vauthors=Espenshade TJ, Guzman JC, Westoff CF |year=2003 |journal=Population Research and Policy Review |volume=22 |pages=575–583 |doi=10.1023/B:POPU.0000020882.29684.8e |issue=5/6}}, Introduction and Table 1, p. 580&lt;/ref&gt; Taken globally, the total fertility rate at replacement was 2.33 children per woman in 2003.&lt;ref name=variation/&gt;  This can be "translated" as 2 children per woman to replace the parents, plus a "third of a child" to make up for the [[Human sex ratio|higher probability of boys]] born and mortality prior to the end of their fertile life.{{efn|1=For example, in the United Kingdom in 2001, 304,635 boys were born as opposed to 289,999 girls, and some of these girls do not survive to the end of their child-bearing years. In future, therefore, the girls born in this year would have to have more than two children each to replace the total population. For a full explanation see {{Cite journal |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/population-trends-rd/population-trends/no--119--spring-2005/replacement-fertility--what-has-it-been-and-what-does-it-mean-.pdf |title=Replacement Fertility, What has it been and What does it mean? |author1=Steve Smallwood |author2=Jessica Chamberlain |last-author-amp=yes |date=Spring 2005 |journal=Population Trends |volume=119 |pages=16–27 }}}}

Replacement level fertility in terms of the [[net reproduction rate]] (NRR) is exactly one, because the NRR takes both mortality rates and sex ratios at birth into account.

As of 2010, about 48% (3.3 billion people) of the world population lives in nations with sub-replacement fertility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121028012124/http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Analytical-Figures/htm/fig_8.htm "Figure 8: Population by Total Fertility (millions)"] in ''World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision''. United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless most of these countries still have growing populations due to [[immigration]], [[population momentum]] and increase of the [[life expectancy]]. This includes most nations of [[Europe]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Russia]], [[Iran]], [[Tunisia]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], the [[United States]] and many others. In 2015, all [[European Union]] countries had a sub-replacement fertility rate, ranging from a low of 1.31 in [[Portugal]] to a high of 1.96 in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdde220&amp;plugin=0 {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The countries or areas that have the lowest fertility are in developed parts of East and Southeast Asia: [[Singapore]], [[Macau]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html |title=Country Comparison :: Total Fertility Rate |website=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few countries have had, for the time being, sufficiently sustained sub-replacement fertility (sometimes combined with other population factors like higher [[emigration]] than [[immigration]]) to have [[population decline]], such as [[Aging of Japan|Japan]], [[Demographics of Germany|Germany]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Ukraine]]. As of 2016, the total fertility rate varied from 0.82 in [[Singapore]] to 6.62 in [[Niger]].&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;

==Causes==
{{Further|Fertility factor (demography)}}
[[File:TFR vs PPP 2015.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Graph of [[Total Fertility Rate]] vs. [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP (PPP) per capita of the corresponding country]], 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2127.html |title=Field Listing: Total Fertility Rate |website=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html|title=Country Comparison: GDP - Per Capita (PPP)|website=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There have been a number of explanations for the general decline in fertility rates in much of the world, and the true explanation is almost certainly a combination of different factors.

===Higher education===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-0807-017, Leipzig, Familienszene.jpg|thumb|left|Woman and her husband, both medical students, and their triplets in the [[East Germany]] (GDR) in 1984. Some countries have had state policies to encourage births among educated women.]]
The fact that more people are going to colleges and universities, and are working to obtain more post-graduate degrees there, along with the soaring costs of education, have contributed greatly to postponing marriage in many cases, and bearing children at all, or fewer numbers of children. And the fact that the number of women getting higher education has increased has contributed to fewer of them getting married younger, if at all. In the US, for example, females make up more than half of all college students, which is a reversal from a few decades back.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/97facts/edu2birt.htm Mother's Educational Level Influences Birth Rate]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between higher education and childbearing varies by country: for example, in Switzerland by age 40, childlessness among women who had completed [[tertiary education]] is 40%, while in  France it is only 15%.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;http://www.oecd.org/els/family/SF_2_5_Childlessness_June2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, childlessness has a longer tradition, and was common even before educational levels increased, but in others, such as [[Southern European]] ones, it is a recent phenomenon; for instance in Spain the childlessness rate for women aged 40–44 in 2011 was 21.60%,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oecd.org/els/family/SF_2-5-Childlessness.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but historically throughout the 20th century it was around 10%.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"/&gt; Not all countries show a relationship between low fertility and education: in [[Czech Republic]], of women born in 1961-1965, low educated women were more likely to be childless than high educated women.&lt;ref&gt;http://demografia.hu/hu/letoltes/publikaciok/EPCposter2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic fluctuation===
{{Further|Income and fertility}}
The growth of [[gross domestic product|wealth]] and [[Human Development Index|human development]] are related to sub-replacement fertility, although a sudden drop in living conditions, such as the [[great depression]], can also lower fertility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prb.org/publications/datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/fact-sheet-us-population.aspx{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Eastern European countries, the fall of communism was followed by an economic collapse in many of these countries in the 1990s. Some countries, such as those that experienced violent conflicts in the 1990s, were badly affected. Large numbers of people lost their jobs, and massive unemployment, lack of jobs outside the big cities, and economic uncertainty discourages people from having children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s12546-014-9141-5|title = Population ageing and low fertility: Recent demographic changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina|journal = Journal of Population Research|volume = 32|pages = 23–43|year = 2015|last1 = Pobric|first1 = Alma|last2 = Robinson|first2 = Guy M}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], the total fertility rate in 2016 was only 1.28 children born/woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bk.html |title=Europe :: Bosnia and Herzegovina |website=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urbanization===
[[File:Merlion_Closeup.JPG|thumb|right|[[Singapore]], a [[city state]], has the lowest TFR in the world in 2016&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;]]
Some consider the increase of [[urbanization]] around the world a central cause.  In recent times, residents of urban areas tend to have fewer children than people in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueki T | title = [Analysis of factors related to the recent decline in birth rate in Japan] | journal = [Nihon Koshu Eisei Zasshi] Japanese Journal of Public Health | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–8 | date = February 1995 | pmid = 7718907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khan HT, Raeside R | title = Factors affecting the most recent fertility rates in urban-rural Bangladesh | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–89 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9004364 | doi = 10.1016/s0277-9536(96)00076-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for extra labour from children on farms does not apply to urban-dwellers. Cities tend to have higher property prices, making a large family more expensive, especially in those societies where each child is now expected to have their own bedroom, rather than sharing with siblings as was the case until recently. Rural areas also tend to be more conservative, with less [[contraception]] and [[abortion]] than urban areas.

===Reduction of child labour===
[[File:Diamond_miners-1-.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Child labor]] is common in many parts of the world]]
Countries which have a high fertility rate are usually less developed countries, where families rely on children to help them, with labour such as [[agricultural]] work, tending to livestock, or even paid work. In such countries [[child labour]] is quite common, with children bringing money at home, or actively supporting the family through pshysical work. By contrast, in the West,  child labour is banned, and it is parents who invest very high costs into their children.&lt;ref&gt;https://tad.colman.ac.il/paper-all/9868.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on the "ideal" family===
Although fertility rates are often discussed in terms of state policies (e.g. financial benefits, combining work with family etc.), the deeply entranced social views on what constitutes an "ideal" family may play a crucial role: if parents do not envision large families in a positive way, it is difficult to "convince" them to have many children. In this regard, there are major differences between European countries: while 50.23% of women aged 15–39 state that the "ideal" family has 3 or more children in [[Estonia]], and 46.43% say this in [[Finland]]; only 11.3% say this in [[Czech Republic]], and 11.39% in [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/social/family/database.htm{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contraception===
Changes in [[contraception]] are also an important cause, and one that has seen dramatic changes in the last few generations. Legalization and widespread acceptance of contraception in the developed world is a large factor in decreased fertility levels; however, for instance in a European context where its prevalence has always been very high in the modern era, the fertility rates do not seem to be influenced significantly by availability of contraception.&lt;ref name=Capri&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Europe the continent with the lowest fertility | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 590–602 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20603286 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq023 | author1 = ESHRE Capri Workshop Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assisted reproductive technology===

The availability of [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART) may foster delay of childbearing, because many couples think that it can solve any future fertility problems.&lt;ref name=Capri/&gt; Its effect on total fertility rate is extremely small but government support for it is beneficial for families.&lt;ref name=Capri/&gt;

===Human Development Index===
[[File:2014_UN_Human_Development_Report_Quartiles.svg|thumb|[[Human Development Index]] map. Darker is higher.]]
The [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) is a composite statistic of [[life expectancy]], [[education]], and [[per capita income]] indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]]. A country scores higher HDI when the [[life expectancy at birth|lifespan]] is higher, the [[education]] level is higher, and the [[GDP per capita]] is higher. There is a strong inverse correlation between the HDI and the fertility rate of the population: the higher the HDI, the lower the fertility rate. As of 2016, the countries with the highest fertility rate are Burundi, Mali, Somalia, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Zambia, Malawi, Angola, and Afghanistan; while most Western countries have sub-replacement fertility rates.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; This is part of the [[Income and fertility|fertility-income paradox]], as these high fertility countries are very poor, and it may seem counter-intuitive for families there to have so many children. The inverse relationship between income and fertility has been termed a ''demographic-economic "[[paradox]]"'' by the notion that greater means would enable the production of more offspring as suggested by the influential [[Thomas Malthus]].

===Government policies===

Some governments have launched programmes to reduce fertility rates and curb population growth. Notably, China implemented a [[one-child policy]] for 35 years (from 1979 to 2015); this was relaxed to a [[two-child policy]] in 2016.

Although today Singapore has a very low fertility rate, and the government encourages parents to have more children because birth rates have fallen below the replacement rate, in the 1970s the situation was the opposite: the government wished to slow and reverse the boom in births that started after [[World War II]] (see the poster).

===Ability to choose===
The total fertility rate is also influenced by the ability to choose what type of family to have, if and when to have children, and the number of children to have - free from coercion, pressure, or interference from the community, extended family, state or church. This includes prohibition on practices such as [[child marriage]], [[forced marriage]] or [[bride price]]. In some cultures for instance, the payment of the bride price creates an obligation on the wife to have children, and failure to do so often results in threats and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women's fears and men's anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–66 | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv }} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf PDF.]&lt;/ref&gt; Western countries have substantially lower fertility rates, and increased [[childlessness]], because people who remain childless or who have small families are less likely to be stigmatized. In many cultures childless women suffer discrimination, stigma, ostracism, and social isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Mother or nothing: the agony of infertility | journal = [[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]] | volume = 88 | issue = 12 | pages = 877&amp;ndash;953 | date = December 2010 | url = http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/88/12/10-011210/en/ | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War ===
It has been shown, both historically and in the present day, that societies engaged in a prolonged state of war experience a substantial lag in fertility rate. The most notable examples of this phenomenon are widely accredited to the First and Second World Wars. Modeled by these examples, "total war" subjects individuals to intense social upheavals and a heavy psychological impact that forcefully prioritizes survival and economic stability over the need to reproduce for the duration of the conflict. Events like these subsequently pave way &lt;ref&gt;Haupt, A., Kane, T. T., &amp; Haub, C. (2011). PRB's population handbook. ''Population reference bureau'' (sixth edition).&lt;/ref&gt; for an active effort to repopulate, such as the "baby boom" after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Demographic Transition Theory|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_54JBLG7V1QC|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2007-09-21|isbn = 9781402044984|language = en|first = John C.|last = Caldwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--- ===Malthusian===
Another school of thought{{who|date=January 2011}} argues that all these factors are a natural outgrowth of a [[Malthusian]] attempt to restore a population balance that was upset earlier.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  The revolution in [[hygiene]] and [[medicine]] that caused [[death rate]]s to plummet during the twentieth century did not see a corresponding fall in [[birth rate]]s until a couple of generations later.  This period of low death rates and high birth rates thus caused human population to balloon at a rate never before seen in human history on such a wide scale.  The Malthusians argue that modern low birth rates are a natural reaction to counteract this imbalance.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}---&gt;

===Tempo effect===
[[File:Tokyo_night_view_1.jpg|thumb|[[Japan]], a highly developed country, is struggling with low fertility rates and [[aging in Japan]]]]
Total fertility rate (TFR) is affected by a phenomenon called the tempo effect, which describes "distortions due to changes in the timing of births." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population Change in Europe, the Middle-East and North Africa: Beyond the Demographic Divide|last=Matthijs|first=Koenraad|last2=Neels|first2=Karel|last3=Timmerman|first3=Christiane|last4=Haers|first4=Jaques|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Bongaarts]] and Griffith Feeney have suggested that this tempo effect is driving the decline of measured fertility rate in the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1728-4457.2002.00419.x| title = The End of the Fertility Transition in the Developed World| journal = Population and Development Review| volume = 28| issue = 3| pages = 419–443| year = 2002| last1 = Bongaarts | first1 = J. | author-link1 = John Bongaarts| citeseerx = 10.1.1.533.4803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type of partnership===
A study of the United States and multiple countries in Europe came to the result that women who continue to [[cohabit]] rather than get married after birth have significantly lower probability of having a second child than married women in all countries except those in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perelli-Harris B | title = How Similar are Cohabiting and Married Parents? Second Conception Risks by Union Type in the United States and Across Europe | journal = European Journal of Population = Revue Europeenne de Demographie | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 437–464 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25395696 | pmc = 4221046 | doi = 10.1007/s10680-014-9320-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, on the contrary, came to the result that cohabiting couples in [[France]] have equal fertility as married ones.&lt;ref name=balbo2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Balbo N, Billari FC, Mills M | title = Fertility in Advanced Societies: A Review of Research: La fécondité dans les sociétés avancées: un examen des recherches | journal = European Journal of Population = Revue Europeenne de Demographie | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–38 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23440941 | pmc = 3576563 | doi = 10.1007/s10680-012-9277-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large survey in the United States came to the result that married women had an average of 1.9 children, compared to 1.3 among those cohabiting. The corresponding numbers for men were 1.7 and 1.1, respectively. The difference of 0.6 children for both sexes was expected to decrease to between 0.2 and 0.3 over the lifetime when correcting for the [[confounder]] that married people have their children earlier in life.&lt;ref name=us2012&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr051.pdf|title=Fertility of Men and Women Aged 15–44 Years in the United States: National Survey of Family Growth, 2006–2010|author1=Gladys Martinez |author2=Kimberly Daniels |author3=Anjani Chandra |publisher=Division of Vital Statistics, [[National Center for Health Statistics]]|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States, those who cohabit without marrying had increased fertility when the male earns considerably more than the female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0042-7092.2007.00700.x |last1=Zhang |first1=Junfu |last2=Song |first2=Xue |title=Fertility Differences between Married and Cohabiting Couples: A Switching Regression Analysis |ssrn=1136407 |url=http://ftp.iza.org/dp3245.pdf |date=December 2007 |doi-broken-date=2018-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequency of sex===
Another explanation for falling fertility could be a reduction in the frequency of sex. For example, according to the Japan Family Planning Association 2016 survey, 47.3% of the men and 47.1% of the women had not had sex with their spouse in the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rt.com/news/377342-sexless-japanese-marriages-study/ |title=Almost half of Japanese marriages are sexless – study |author=Jeremy Hoare |date=14 February 2017 |website=RT Question More}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and government acceptance of non-traditional families===
In recent years, the marriage rate in many countries (especially in the West) has decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://euobserver.com/social/27161 |title=Europeans marry older, less often |author=Elitsa Vucheva |date=21 November 2008 |website=EUobserver}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more young people reject traditional lifestyles that include marriage, the issue arises whether the state accepts non-traditional families such as those based on non-marital [[cohabitation]], or whether it actively discourages non-marital childbearing. In Western countries, the former position of accepting cohabiting couples and supporting them as a legitimate form of family has been connected with a higher fertility rate (e.g. Scandinavian countries, France, where most births occur outside of marriage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00018 |title=Share of live births outside marriage |website=[[Eurostat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) while the latter (such as East  Asia - Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore) has been connected with a very low fertility rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |others=United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division |year=2014 |url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/fertility/worldFertilityReport2013.pdf |title=World Fertility Report 2013: Fertility at the Extremes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High investment per child===
[[File:Infant mortality map of the world.svg|thumbnail|[[Infant mortality]] rates, under age 1, in 2013. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest infant mortality rate, as well as the highest TFR.]]
People are more likely in modern society to invest strongly in the needs of their children, such as offering them the best education, shelter (a room only for the child), travel, cultural activities etc. In the past, when [[child mortality]] was high, people had more children, but invested less in them. Today, parents usually experience much less doubt about whether the child will live to adulthood, and so are more likely to strongly invest in that child. But strongly investing in each child makes it more difficult to have large numbers of children—a "quantity vs. quality trade-off" effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://wol.iza.org/articles/quantity-quality-fertility-education-trade-off.pdf |title=The quantity–quality fertility–education trade-off |author=Haoming Liu |publisher=IZA World of Labor |date=May 2015 |via=wol.iza.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender expectations and norms===
Social norms both within the family and in society at large determine fertility levels.
The quality of couple relations in terms of support given to the woman matters, with studies on fertility in the West showing a U-shaped relationship between [[gender equity]] within the couple and fertility: in countries with very low fertility rates, the probability of a woman to have the second child occurs at the extremes - either very low gender equality or very high gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Balbo N, Billari FC, Mills M |title= Fertility in Advanced Societies: A Review of Research [La fécondité dans les sociétés avancées: un examen des recherches] |journal= European Journal of Population [Revue Europeenne De Demographie] |volume= 29 |issue= 1 |pages= 1–38 |date= February 2013 |pmid= 23440941 |pmc= 3576563 |doi= 10.1007/s10680-012-9277-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also reflected at a social level: countries that are neither sufficiently patriarchal to coerce women into having large families, nor sufficiently egalitarian to incentivize women to have more children through strong support (such as subsidized childcare and good support of working mothers), have very low fertility rates, especially among educated women. Where women are expected to 'choose' between their professional and public life, or having children, the more educated the woman is, the more likely she is to choose the former. The strong emphases on the domestic role of women in Germany (unlike Scandinavia and France) was described as the cause of the very low fertility in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Kate Connolly |date=21 September 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/21/germany-birthrate-low-falling |title=Germany's birthrate is the lowest in Europe – and falling fast |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=29 May 2015 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32929962 |title=Germany passes Japan to have world's lowest birth rate – study |newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Luke Harding |date=26 January 2006 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/27/germany.lukeharding |title=Germany agonises over 30% childless women |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical effects==
The [[Greeks|Greek]] historian [[Polybius]] largely blamed the decline of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic world]] on low fertility rates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Polybius |authorlink= Polybius |title= Histories |volume= 37 |chapter= Depopulation of Greece |chapter-url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%253Atext%253A1999.01.0234%253Abook%253D37%253Achapter%253D9 |website= Perseus |publisher= Tufts |access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing in his work [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']] that:

Upon the establishment of the [[Roman Empire]], [[List of Roman emperors|Emperor]] [[Augustus]] would introduce [[Jus trium liberorum|legislation]] to increase the birthrates of the Roman nobility.&lt;ref name= "EBAugustus"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507905/ancient-Rome/26655/Administration-of-Rome-and-Italy |title= Ancient Rome: Administration of Rome and Italy |website= [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher= [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |access-date= January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that not only the [[Great Recession]], but the [[Great Depression]], may have been the result of a decline in birthrates overall. Clarence L. Barber, an economist at the University of Manitoba, pointed out how demand for housing in the US, for example, began to decline in 1926, due to a decline in 'household formation' (marriage), due, he believed, to the effects of World War I upon society. In early 1929, US housing demand declined precipitously and the stock market crash followed in October of that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |via= QC econ BBA |chapter-url= http://www.qc-econ-bba.org/instructors/Edelstein11/ECON224/07.pdf |author=Gene Smiley |title=The American Economy in the 20th Century |chapter=Chapter 7: What Caused the Great Depression? |at=Page 7-1 |access-date=2011-12-18 |deadurl= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120309124147/http://www.qc-econ-bba.org/instructors/Edelstein11/ECON224/07.pdf |archive-date=  9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all | quote = Real gross housing expenditures on new units can be separated into two multiplicative components; housing starts and the real average investment per unit.  25 After estimating the determinants of each, Bolch, Fels, and McMahon examined the building hypothesis by simulating what would have been the case in each situation if a "normal" situation had occurred.  26 The result was overbuilding in the number of housing units from 1922 through 1929. They also found "overinvestment" per individual housing unit from 1921 to 1928 and conclude that excessive housing starts relative to family formation led to the sharp decline in housing construction at the end of the twenties. In their view the demographic changes in the twenties were the proximate causes of this.  In a 1978 study Clarence Barber was even more emphatic on the importance of demographic changes, suggesting that these were the ultimate explanation of the Great Depression.  27 Basing his explanation on a Harrod-Domar growth model, Barber argues that the rapid decline in the population's growth rate disturbed that equilibrium, and this rapid fall in the natural growth rate initiated the depression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempts to forcefully increase the fertility rate==
{{See|Abortion in Romania|Decree 770|Romanian orphans}}
One of the most notorious policies of forceful attempts to increase the TFR occurred in [[communist Romania]] between 1967 and 1990. Communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] adopted a very aggressive natalist policy that included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people. This period was depicted in movies and documentaries (such as ''[[4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days]]'', ''[[Children of the Decree]]''). These policies increased birth rates for a few years, but this was followed by a decline due to increased [[illegal abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= The ESHRE Capri Workshop Group |title= Europe the continent with the lowest fertility |journal= Human Reproduction Update |volume= 16 |issue= 6 |pages= 590–602 |year= 2010 |pmid= 20603286 |doi= 10.1093/humupd/dmq023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Horga M, Gerdts C, Potts M |title= The remarkable story of Romanian women's struggle to manage their fertility |journal= The Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care |volume= 39 |issue= 1 |pages= 2–4 |date= January 2013 |pmid= 23296845 |doi= 10.1136/jfprhc-2012-100498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceaușescu's policy resulted in over 9,000 women who died due to illegal abortions,&lt;ref name="Kligman short"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kligman |first=Gail |chapter=Political Demography: The Banning of Abortion in Ceausescu's Romania |editor-last1=Ginsburg |editor-first1=Faye D. |editor-last2=Rapp |editor-first2=Rayna |title=Conceiving the New World Order: The Global Politics of Reproduction |location=Berkeley, CA |publisher=University of California Press |year=1995 |pages=234–255 |id=AIDSLINE KIE/49442}}&lt;/ref&gt; large numbers of children put into orphanages by parents who couldn't cope with raising them, [[street children]] in the 1990s (when many orphanages were closed and the children ended on the streets), and [[overcrowding]] in homes and schools. In addition, Ceaușescu's demographic policies are feared of having very serious effects in the future, because the generations born under Ceaușescu are large (especially the late 1960s and the 1970s), while those born in the 1990s and 2000s are very small. This is believed to cause a very serious demographic shock when the former generations [[Retirement|retire]], as there will be insufficient young people in the workforce to support the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zf.ro/eveniment/ce-se-va-intampla-cand-vor-iesi-la-pensie-decreteii-cei-1-7-milioane-de-romani-care-sustin-economia-5997071{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zf.ro/eveniment/pensiile-decreteilor-sunt-o-bomba-cu-ceas-statul-le-poate-plati-15-din-salariu-la-batranete-10096647{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evz.ro/apocalipsa-pensiilor-vine-dupa-2030-cum-poate-fi-evitata.html{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Romania, a relatively similar policy of restricted [[reproductive rights]] during that period also existed in [[Communist Albania]], under [[Enver Hoxha]] (see [[Abortion in Albania]]).

==Current effects==
Population aging may pose an economic challenge to governments as the number of retired citizens drawing public pensions rises in relation to the number of workers. This has been raised as a political issue in [[France]], [[Germany]], and the [[United States]] where many people have advocated policy changes to encourage higher birth and immigration rates.

Analysing data for 40 countries, Lee et al. show that fertility well above replacement and population growth would typically be most beneficial for government budgets. However, fertility near replacement and population stability would be most beneficial for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. And fertility moderately below replacement and population decline would maximize standards of living when the cost of providing capital for a growing labour force is taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Lee R, Mason A |title= Is low fertility really a problem?

Note the vertical axis is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] and represents millions of people.]]
Sub-replacement fertility does not automatically translate into a population decline because of increasing life expectancy and [[population momentum]]: recently high fertility rates produce a disproportionately young population, and younger populations have higher birth rates. This is why some nations with sub-replacement fertility still have a growing population, because a relatively large fraction of their population are still of child-bearing age. But if the fertility trend is sustained (and not compensated by [[immigration]]), it results in [[population ageing]] and/or [[population decline]]. This is already happening and impacts first most of the countries of [[Europe]] and [[East Asia]].

Current estimates expect the world's total fertility rate to fall below replacement levels by 2050,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
though population momentum continues to increase global population for several generations beyond that. The development of the world population is linked with concerns of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[sustainability]] and exceeding Earth's [[carrying capacity]].

Some governments, fearful of a future pensions crisis, have developed [[natalist]] policies to attempt to encourage more women to have children.  Measures include increasing tax allowances for working parents, improving child-care provision, reducing working hours/weekend working in female-dominated professions such as healthcare and a stricter enforcement of anti-discrimination measures to prevent professional women's promotion prospects being hindered when they take time off work to care for children. Over recent years, the fertility rate has increased to around 2.0 in France and 1.9 in Britain and some other northern European countries, but the role of population policies in these trends is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suddenly, the old world looks younger |work=The Economist |date=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, for example, natalist policies may have actually discouraged the Italian population from having more children. This "widespread resistance" was the result of the Italian government, at one point,{{when|date=April 2017}} taxing single persons and criminalizing abortion and even contraception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Marchesi M |title= Reproducing Italians: contested biopolitics in the age of 'replacement anxiety' |journal= Anthropology &amp; Medicine |volume= 19 |issue= 2 |pages= 171–88 |year= 2012 |pmid= 22889426 |doi= 10.1080/13648470.2012.675043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

European analysts hope, with the help of government incentives and large-scale change towards family-friendly policies, to stall the population decline and reverse it by around 2030, expecting that most of Europe will have a slight natural increase by then. [[C. D. Howe Institute]], for example, tries to demonstrate that immigration cannot be used to effectively counter [[population ageing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Guillemette |first1=Yvan |last2=Robson |first2=William B.P. |date=September 2006 |url=http://www.cdhowe.org/pdf/backgrounder_96.pdf |title=No Elixir of Youth: Immigration Cannot Keep Canada Young |work=Backgrounder |issue=96 |publisher=C.D.

==Cases of fertility rate increases in individual countries==

===United States===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
{{Original research section|date=October 2008}}
While much of the world has experienced declining fertility rates over the last twenty years, the total fertility rate in the [[United States]] has remained relatively stable in comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_GraphicalDisplay.aspx?ListNames=%22Total%20Fertility%20Rate,%20History%20plus%20Forecast%22&amp;HistFor=True&amp;GrpOp=0&amp;Dim1=175&amp;File=0 |title= Total Fertility Rate of the United States, History plus Forecast |publisher=University of Denver |website=The Frederick S. Pardee Center for [[International Futures]] | access-date = 26 April 2012}}{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely due to the high fertility rate among communities such as Hispanics, but it is also because the fertility rate among [[non-Hispanic whites]] in the US, after falling to about 1.6 in the 1970s and early 1980s, had increased and is now around 1.89 rather than lower to the 1.6 level common in Europe. It can also be explained by substantial immigration.

[[New England]] has a rate similar to most [[Western European]] countries, while the [[American South|South]], [[Midwest]], and border states have fertility rates considerably higher than replacement. States where [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has a strong presence, most notably [[Utah]], also have higher-than-replacement fertility rates, especially among the LDS population. Heaton and Goodman (1985) found that LDS women average about one child more than women in other religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = Kristen L. | last2 = Heaton | first2 = Tim B. | year = 1985 | title = Religion and Family Formation | journal = Review of Religious Research | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 343–359 | jstor = 3511049 | url =  | format =  | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israel]] is the only developed country that has never had sub-replacement fertility; a declining [[Arab]] and [[Bedouin]] fertility rate is countered by [[Judaism|religious]] [[Jewish]] groups (mostly [[Haredim]]) with higher than average fertility rates. In addition, the (mostly non-religious){{citation needed|date=June 2013}} [[aliyah]] Jews from the former [[USSR]] shifted from a 1 child per woman fertility rate to an average fertility rate close to 2.2 children per woman. As of 2008, Israel's Jewish fertility rate is the highest among the industrial nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theettingerreport.com/OpEd/General/Demographic-Optimism,-Not-Pessimism.aspx |title=Demographic Optimism, Not Pessimism |author=Yoram Ettinger |work=The Washington Jewish Week |date=25 July 2008 |via=The Ettinger Report |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223001355/http://www.theettingerreport.com/OpEd/General/Demographic-Optimism,-Not-Pessimism.aspx |archive-date=2014-02-23 |access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Thomas Corwin''''' was a United States Revenue Cutter and subsequently a merchant vessel. These two very different roles both centered on Alaska and the Bering Sea.  In 1912, Frank Willard Kimball wrote: "The '''''Corwin''''' has probably had a more varied and interesting career than any other vessel which plies the Alaskan waters."&lt;ref&gt;Kimball; italics substituted for Kimball's quotes on ''Corwin''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Revenue Cutter ''Thomas Corwin''''' (aka the ''Corwin'') was the first revenue cutter to regularly cruise the [[Bering Sea]] and the [[Arctic Ocean]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;US Coast Guard, Historian's Office (a)&lt;/ref&gt; Built in the state of [[Oregon]], she was finished and commissioned in [[San Francisco]] which remained her home port.  In a 23-year federal career, she participated in the search for the {{USS|Jeannette|1878|6}}, landed scientific parties on [[Wrangel Island|Wrangel]] and [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald]] islands, took part in the [[Angoon Bombardment|shelling]] of the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] village Angoon, interdicted whiskey traffic, rescued shipwrecked whalers, contributed to the exploration of [[Alaska]], and arrested  seal poachers. She had at least eight captains during her federal career,&lt;ref&gt;Commanders of the USRC Corwin: (Rank is Captain unless noted) J.W. White January 1877-July 1878; Lt. J. Brann approx. July 1878-April 1879; C.L. Hooper April 1880-Dec 1881; M.A. Healy Feb 1882-Apr 1886; A.B. Davis Apr 1886-May 1886; C.A. Abbey May 1886-Nov 1886; C.L.Hooper April 1887–1892, F.M. Munger 1892–1895, W.D. Roath 1896 (exchanged commands with H.D. Smith 1896); W.J. Herring 1898 (inclusive dates unknown).  Captain [D.F.] Tozier handled the sale of the ship in 1900.  McCurdy's lists additionally captains Roth [Roath?] and Slamm, without dates; Captain Slamm had the USRC ''Grant'' in 1896. A Who's Who entry lists [Lt] P.W. Thompson.  US Coast Guard 1935; New York Times Nov 9, 1891; Nov 16, 1892; May 19, 1895; Dec 14, 1895; April 9, 1896; Sep 11, 1896; Treasury register 1879; Tacoma Public Library (c); Who's Who in America.&lt;/ref&gt; but is particularly associated with two: the cool and resolute [[Calvin L. Hooper]] and the volatile [[Michael A. Healy|Michael Healy]].  She continued operating in the Bering Sea as a merchant and charter vessel after she was sold in 1900.

As a merchant vessel, the '''SS ''Corwin''''' started out as a support vessel for minerals exploration, and subsequently was extensively modified to carry passengers.  She served coastal ports on Norton and Kotzebue Sounds, the Seward Peninsula, and the Bering Strait during the shipping season, and generally wintered in Puget Sound.  She was the first steamer to reach Nome in the spring  multiple years, and also frequently the last steamer out in the fall. Her Master through most of her commercial service was Ellsworth Luce West. She attempted to rescue the [[Karluk (ship)|''Karluk'']] survivors from Wrangel Island and participated in the search for four missing ''Karluk'' crewmen in 1914.

==Construction==

The ''Corwin'' was named for [[Thomas Corwin]], a well-known mid-nineteenth-century politician who served as  [[Secretary of the Treasury]] during [[Millard Fillmore]]'s presidency.  She was the second of three [[Revenue Cutter Service]] and [[Coast Guard]] vessels to bear the name (there was also a patrol boat ''[[Cape-class cutter|Cape Corwin]]'').&lt;ref&gt;US Coast Guard, Historian's Office (a,c)&lt;/ref&gt;

She was built as a single-screw steam-powered topsail [[schooner]] by [[Oregon Iron Works (Albina)|Oregon Iron Works]] at [[Albina, Oregon|Albina]] ([[Portland Oregon|Portland]]) Oregon in 1876  and commissioned at San Francisco in 1877.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;US Coast Guard, Historian's Office (a)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tacoma Public Library a"&gt;Tacoma Public Library (a)&lt;/ref&gt; She was constructed of fir and "fastened with copper, galvanized iron, and locust tree nails".&lt;ref name="Nourse"&gt;Nourse&lt;/ref&gt;  Her appearance was typical of revenue cutters of the period, flush-decked (or nearly so) with clipper bow, fantail stern, two sail-bearing masts, pilot house and funnel amidships and a deckhouse (probably including the upper parts of the engine and boiler rooms) beneath and extending behind the pilot house. The boiler powering the propulsion machinery was of the [[Scotch marine boiler]] type and was the first instance of that type of boiler on a Revenue Cutter Service vessel.&lt;ref name=Evans98&gt;Evans, p 98&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of steam jackets on the cylinders to reduce condensation losses was another innovation new to the service.&lt;ref name=Evans98 /&gt;  Her cost and displacement were somewhat greater than the [[USRC Dexter (1874)|Dexter-class]] (1874) cutters of similar length and overall design.&lt;ref&gt;Compare US Coast Guard, Historian's Office (b). The Dexter class consisted of ''Dexter'', ''Rush'', and ''Dallas''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the ''Corwin'' was contracted in May 1875 with completion scheduled for February 28, 1876. Captain John W. White was construction superintendent for the Revenue Cutter Service.  The ''Corwin'' was the first government vessel constructed in the state of Oregon,&lt;ref name="Tacoma Public Library a"/&gt; and a large crowd came out to see her launched August 23, 1876. Oregon Iron Works became insolvent that fall and was declared bankrupt; this resulted in liens filed against the vessel by suppliers and subcontractors for unpaid bills.  On January 2, 1877, Judge J. Deady of the U.S District Court, Oregon District ruled that the lien of libellants Coffin and Hendry was valid, that the government was not yet the owner of the vessel and had not been in possession when the vessel was seized by the marshal on November 29.  However, the ''Corwin'' had been extricated about January 1, 1877 by Captain White and the [[USRC Rush (1874)|USRC ''Rush'']] and moved to the middle of the Columbia River (another source has this about January 10).  The Government appealed Judge Deady's ruling and Coffin and Hendry withdrew their claim on the basis of assurances that they would be paid faster if they settled. After a flurry of unsuccessful legal actions by other claimants, the ''Corwin'' was  removed to San Francisco where she was completed at a cost of $10150.77 and subsequently commissioned. Congress was still considering suppliers and workmen's claims in 1884.&lt;ref name="Tacoma Public Library a"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;50th Congress 1st Session House Report 456&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;48th Congress 1st session Senate Reports 572, 573&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimball&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The revenue cutter''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' Jan 22, 1877&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Corwin'' was reported to be capable of 12 knots under sail (48-hour average with a beam wind), 11.5 knots under steam alone, and 13–14 knots under combined power.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' January 17, 1892, June 16, 1891&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, her speed (probably cruising speed) was reported as 9 knots.&lt;ref name="Vanderlip"&gt;Vanderlip&lt;/ref&gt;  Details of the ''Corwin's'' original three-gun armament are not available.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;US Coast Guard, Historian's Office (a)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1891 she reportedly carried four three-inch [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] rifles and two [[Gatling gun]]s.  In July 1891, the ''New York Times'' reported that she would be rearmed with six-pounder [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss]] rapid-fire guns.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' June 16, 1891, July 3, 1891&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal career==

The ''Corwin'' spent her entire career in the Pacific and Arctic oceans; her home port throughout her government service was San Francisco.  She made her first trip to northern waters in 1877 under Captain J.W. White.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;US Coast Guard, Historian's Office (a)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880 and 1881  with Calvin L. Hooper commanding and Michael Healy as Executive Officer, she searched in the Arctic for the USS ''Jeannette'', a lost exploration vessel, and two lost whalers, ''Vigilant'' and ''Mount Wollaston''.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, p 115&lt;/ref&gt; For this expedition, she was sheathed with one-inch oak planks from two feet above the water line to six feet below, with the oak applied over the copper and secured with 2.5-inch composition nails.  Also added was an ice-breaking attachment for her bow, constructed of 3/8&amp;nbsp;inch iron plate, which could be put in place when needed.&lt;ref name="Nourse"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hooper&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Hooper sent out exploratory parties by dogsled along the Siberian arctic coast. Artifacts and stories collected from the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] residents of the coast confirmed that the ''Vigilant'' had been lost with no survivors, and apparently had picked up survivors from the ''Mount Wollaston'' before her own disaster.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' Nov 7, 1881&lt;/ref&gt;  In the course of the ''Corwin's'' 1880 cruise, Captain Hooper located and mapped coal deposits in cliffs east of [[Cape Lisburne]], Alaska, previously discovered by Captain E.E. Smith, the ''Corwin's'' ice pilot. The crew mined coal from these deposits in both 1880 and 1881, and the site has since been known as the Corwin coal mine.

In 1881 the ''Corwin'' carried a scientific detachment including [[John Muir]], Irving C. Rosse, M.D., and [[Edward William Nelson|Edward W. Nelson]], and in the course of the search for the ''Jeannette'' landed parties on [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald]] and [[Wrangel Island]]s in the [[Chukchi Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans, pp 118&amp;ndash;119&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1882, with Michael Healy as Captain, the ''Corwin'' was dispatched to [[Saint Lawrence Bay, Chukotka|St Lawrence Bay]] to pick up the stranded crew of the ''[[USS Rodgers (1879)|USS Rodgers]]'', another ship of the ''Jeannette'' search which burned while overwintering in Siberia. The ''Rodgers'' crew was picked up by the whaler ''North Star'' and later transferred to the ''Corwin'' which returned them to San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' April 30, 1882, June 22, 1882 June 24, 1882&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1882 she participated in the [[Angoon Bombardment]] which was the shelling and burning of the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] village [[Angoon]] in retaliation for a hostage-taking incident. A contemporary letter discovered about 1990 partly confirms and partly refutes the official Navy account of this incident.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;US Coast Guard, Historian's Office (a)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Naval Historical Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, pp 39&amp;ndash;40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strobridge &amp; Noble, p 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gagne-Hawes&lt;/ref&gt; Her voyages in 1884 and 1885 included explorations by boat detachments of the [[Kobuk River|Kobuk]] (1884 and 1885; Healy wrote Kowak) and [[Noatak River|Noatak]] (1885) rivers in Alaska and the first ascent and investigation of the newly formed [[Bogoslof Island|Bogoslof]] volcano in the [[Aleutians]].&lt;ref&gt;Healy, M.A. 1887, 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, p 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Corwin'' was replaced on the Arctic patrol by the [[USS Bear (1874)|USRC ''Bear'']] starting in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, p 129&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the reasons for this change was the ''Corwin's'' limited coal capacity which interfered with long cruises.&lt;ref&gt;King, p 82&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Corwin'' returned to the Bering Sea in 1886 and from 1890 to 1897 to combat [[fur seal]] poaching.&lt;ref name="United States Coast Guard 1935"&gt;United States Coast Guard (1935)&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1893 she carried dispatches to US ambassador [[Albert S. Willis]] in [[History of Hawaii|Hawaii]] at the height of the political crisis following the deposition of Queen [[Liliuokalani]].  ''Corwin's'' arrival there caused some consternation since it was thought it might signal US intervention to restore the queen.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' December 6, 1893 (a,b), January 20, 1894; technically, Willis's title was Minister; ambassador (un-capitalized) is here used descriptively.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Corwin'' went into the dockyard at [[Quartermaster Harbor]], Washington for extensive repairs including refastening and some engine work before the 1896 season.&lt;ref&gt;Tacoma Public Library (b)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' Dec 14, 1895&lt;/ref&gt;  She operated under Navy orders with a Revenue Service crew during the [[Spanish–American War]], serving around San Diego, and was returned to the [[United States Treasury Department]] in August 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&lt;/ref&gt; She was back in service in Alaska in 1899&lt;ref name="United States Coast Guard 1935"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' October 17, 1899&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Corwin'' was decommissioned and sold February 14, 1900 for {{usd}}16,500 and was replaced on the Bering Sea patrol by the [[USRC Manning (1898)|USRC ''Manning'']].&lt;ref name=RoM196&gt;Record of Movements, p 196&lt;/ref&gt; ''Corwin'' remained active in the Bering Sea as a merchant and charter vessel after she was sold.&lt;ref&gt;US Coast Guard, Historian's Office (a); West. McCurdy's has the sale in 1899, for {{usd}}17,025, to J.E Ryus (Tacoma Public Library (c)); ''Victoria Daily Colonist'' Feb 15, 1900 says Ryus did not fulfill offer; ship sold to Tacoma Fish Company for {{usd}}16,000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merchant career==

===Minerals exploration===
In 1900 Ellsworth Luce West, a whaling captain from [[Martha's Vineyard]], and some Boston investors formed a company to develop the coal deposits near Cape Lisburne to supply the [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] market.  Needing a suitable ship, they entered the winning bid for the ''Corwin'' and organized as the Corwin Trading Company.  The project increased in scope when one investor (veteran prospector, engineer, and writer A.G. Kingsbury) pledged Nome gold claims for his shares. Although Kingsbury described them as "conservative Boston capitalists" the investors appear to have been as much enthusiasts as any Nome prospectors; all insisted on joining the expedition.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;West&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingsbury 1900"&gt;Kingsbury 1900&lt;/ref&gt;  To create cargo space in the ''Corwin'', West had the entire wardroom torn out. The lost accommodations were replaced with a cabin constructed from the stern to the engine room, creating a raised [[poop deck]].&lt;ref name="West"&gt;West&lt;/ref&gt;  This modification is shown clearly in a 1902 photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis; a photo in Kingsbury (1900) shows the ''Corwin'' in the dockyard with the cabin partly built&lt;/ref&gt; West describes the ''Corwin'' as brig-rigged in this period, but photos from 1900 continue to show a gaff on the foremast and no yards crossed on the mainmast, so this is more a difference of terminology than a change of sail-plan.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;West&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingsbury 1900"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A brigantine is also known as a hermaphrodite brig in US usage, and the only difference between a brigantine and a topsail schooner is the presence of a fore-and-aft foresail in the latter. In the 1902 Curtis photo the foresail gaff is gone but there are still no yards on the mainmast.  There is no foresail boom in any photo, even from her revenue cutter days.  Vanderlip implausibly calls her a barkentine.  West reports using sails at various times in 1900 and 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain West could not obtain a passenger license for the ship without having her re-caulked, so the small number of passengers were signed as crew members. She went up to Nome carrying expedition equipment and general cargo and from about June 3–10 was occupied with the rescue and salvage of the [[barkentine]] ''Catherine Sudden'', which had suffered a punctured hull and two broken masts hitting ice.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;West&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Marine''...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Catherine Sudden''&lt;/ref&gt; A little later she set out on a prospecting expedition to [[Cape Chaplino]] and stopped at [[St Lawrence Island]] about June 17.  There she encountered the Russian steamer ''Progress'', chartered by American mining engineer [[Washington Vanderlip]] and his Russian backers.  Vanderlip hired the ''Corwin'' to clear a channel through the ice so ''Progress'' could reach Cape Chaplino and the clear water just off the Siberian coast.&lt;ref name="Vanderlip"/&gt;

Vanderlip described the ''Corwin's'' action as an icebreaker:  "Some of the ice the Corwin can push to one side or the other but when this is not possible she backs up in order to get good headway and charges the obstruction and strikes it fairly between the eyes. She comes to a dead stop and quivers from stem to stern with the tremendous impact A rending grinding noise is heard and the berg which challenged us is a berg no longer..." &lt;ref&gt;Vanderlip p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

Finding the streams near Cape Chaplino still ice-clogged, the Corwin returned to Nome. In mid-July she headed north on a minerals exploration trip.  She reached the coal deposits after prospecting stops at [[Grantley Harbor]] (adjacent to [[Port Clarence, Alaska]]) and along the coast. The largest seam had already been staked by a competing company (that party traveled by land), but the ''Corwin's'' party staked several other claims, mined and loaded coal, and returned to Nome with 100 tons (four lighter-loads) to sell. Coal was handled in sacks of 200&amp;nbsp;lb, lowered down the cliffs by rope. It reportedly sold tor $18–20 per ton at Nome.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt;  A second  trip developed the mines and brought out 25 tons.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;West&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Packard&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1901 the ''Corwin'' was towed from [[Port Townsend]] to [[Esquimalt]] and hauled out for refitting.  She then spent most of that summer tied to the dock for nonpayment of the dockyard bill. Captain West, who had spent the early part of the season as second mate on an east coast collier, was eventually sent west with $2000 to settle up.  After paying the bills, he set about finding work for the vessel to pay her keep.  A plan to charter her out for halibut fishing was vetoed by F.W. Huestis, president of the Corwin Trading Company, reportedly because of insurance costs.&lt;ref&gt;''Victoria Daily Colonist'' April 25, 1901; West. This paragraph follows West in having her towed from Port Townsend (rather than coming up from Seattle under her own power), but follows the Colonist for the date.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Victoria Daily Colonist'' November 26, 1901&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passenger and freight service===

[[File:Bear and Corwin June 1914.JPG|300 px|right|thumb|USRC ''Bear'' and ''Corwin'' shortly after arrival at Nome, June 1, 1914]]

By 1902 the ''Corwin'' was licensed to carry passengers as well as freight. Accommodations were rearranged to carry 35 first-class and 50 [[steerage]] passengers. She departed Seattle in May and spent the summer and early fall serving Nome and surrounding towns and camps as far north as Deering on Kotzebue Sound.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;West&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Morning Leader'' Nov 29, 1902; Nov 1, 1903&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nowell 1902&lt;/ref&gt;  She underwent further modification at [[Robert Moran (shipbuilder)|Moran's]] yard in Seattle before the 1904 season.   This work extended or replaced the stern cabin to give her an entire second deck as well as a vertical [[Stem (ship)|stem]] (fitted with a steel ice protector),&lt;ref&gt;West; the first ice protector was made in two pieces held by bolts, not the single wrap-around piece West specified.  It tore loose as soon as it hit ice.  A successor can be seen in the Lomen Brothers photo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Navigation 1903, 1904; in 1903 tonnage was listed as 307 gross, 153 net, length 137.5', depth of hold 11.2'; in 1904, 447 tons gross, 239 net, 138' length, 13.2 depth of hold; List of Merchant Vessels 1913 Part 6 shows her with two decks. There is only one ''Corwin'' in these tables throughout this period and she is specifically identified as the former USRC ''Corwin'' by footnote.&lt;/ref&gt; two new deckhouses, and a forward pilothouse.  This so altered her appearance&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, 1910&lt;/ref&gt; that only a few of her numerous subsequent photographs give any hint&lt;ref&gt;Lomen Bros.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nowell 1907 a, b&lt;/ref&gt; of her past as a schooner.&lt;ref&gt;Degroff&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the outward changes she was modernized with addition of electric lighting throughout the ship and running water in all staterooms. The changes added six first-class staterooms and more steerage space, bringing her capacity to 100 passengers and about 200 tons freight.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;West&lt;/ref&gt;  One source reports the cost of the rebuilding as $40000.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball; it is not clear from the context whether this is the 1904 refit or the total cost of work from 1900 on. According to West, the 1904 work was initially estimated at $20000 but there were overruns.&lt;/ref&gt; When she headed out for Alaska in May 1904 after addition of the second deck there were rumors the modification had made her topheavy.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;West&lt;/ref&gt; Some passengers complained before departure that she was overloaded and unseaworthy.  Inspectors ordered that all freight be stowed below deck, but permitted her to sail.  Subsequently there were reports that wreckage from the ship had been found on Vancouver Island leading to fears she was lost, but she reached Nome safely on June 8.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;West&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Victoria Daily Colonist'' May 20, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' May 24, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Victoria Daily Colonist'', June 25, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Victoria Daily Colonist'' could not find the origin of the reports and branded them a deliberate hoax.&lt;ref&gt;''Victoria Daily Colonist'', May 24, 1904 p3, May 26, 1904, p8&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Corwin'' continued in the passenger and freight business&lt;ref&gt;Harrison p 374&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times May 31, 1914"&gt;''New York Times'' May 31, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1906 to 1910 held a contract to transport mail to towns on [[Norton Sound]] and the [[Seward Peninsula]]. She was the first ship to reach Nome in the spring in 1902–1909, 1913 and 1914. She generally returned to Puget Sound in the fall and was often the last ship out of Nome.&lt;ref&gt;West; Corwin had carried mail from Seattle to Nome in earlier years at no charge to the government.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' August 15, 1909&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tacoma Public Library (d)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Morning Leader Nov 29, 1902''&lt;/ref&gt; In part, her early arrivals were due to the fact that she was sheathed&lt;ref&gt;Kimball (1912) describes the sheathing as ironwood. Vanderlip describes her sheathing in 1900 as "greenheart timber", possibly [[Chlorocardium rodiei]]. The original oak could have been replaced in the 1896 refit or possibly earlier. ''Victoria Daily Colonist'', May 9, 1901 reports the ''Corwin'' was stripped, caulked, sheathed, and copper painted at Bullen's yard, though West, p 90, is unaware she had been recaulked.&lt;/ref&gt; and retained a protected and reinforced bow for ice work.  In 1908, after arriving at Nome during a particularly bad ice season, the Corwin headed out again and cut channels to free three steamers that were stuck in the ice 50 miles from Nome, one (the ''Victoria'') in danger of sinking and all in danger of being carried north by moving ice.&lt;ref&gt;West, ''Victoria Daily Colonist'' June 19, 1908; see also Kimball&lt;/ref&gt; 
On June 11, 1909, Corwin received a distress call from ''St. Croix'' a vessel trapped in the ice and taking on water South of Nome. Corwin refused to come to the aid of St. Croix for no less than [[United States dollar|$]]6,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stephenson |first=William, B |date=1919|title=The Land of Tomorrow |url=https://archive.org/details/landoftomorrow00stepiala |location=University of California Libraries |publisher=George H. Doran |page=26 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1914, it was arranged that she would lead the waiting fleet of steamers into Nome, following closely as the Revenue Cutter ''Bear'' picked out a channel through the ice.&lt;ref name="New York Times May 31, 1914"/&gt; For most of her merchant career, she was owned by the Pacific Coal and Transportation Company (successor to the Corwin Trading Company), and her official home port was listed as Boston. Captain West returned as Master from 1902 to 1910; his wife Gertrude sailed with him as Ship's Clerk.  Most of the crew were Eskimo (they were less likely to desert the ship to go prospecting), and the kitchen staff were Chinese.  The ''Corwin'' held daily fire drills, and was equipped with wireless since the 1904 refit.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;West&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stearns&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Navigation 1901, 1903, 1904, 1909&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keeler&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''San Francisco Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 and 1912, the ''Corwin'' was listed as a ship of the Western Alaska Steamship Company.&lt;ref&gt;Commissioner of Navigation&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1913, her home port was listed as Seattle and her owner as Ben Moyses.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Navigation 1913 Part 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted Karluk rescue===
In 1914, a wealthy Nome mine-owner and businessman, [[Jafet Lindeberg]], chartered the ''Corwin'' (Captain R.J. Healy) from the Kotzebue Transportation and Trading Company to attempt a rescue the ''[[Voyage of the Karluk|Karluk]]'' survivors from [[Wrangel Island]]. She reached Wrangel Island one day after the survivors had been rescued by [[Olaf Swenson]] and his crew in the ''[[King &amp; Winge (fishing schooner)|King &amp; Winge]]''. She then proceeded to look for four missing members of ''Karluk's'' crew, circling [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald Island]] without seeing any sign of the missing men. The ''Corwin'' struck a reef off Cape Douglas on her return trip and went hard aground.  She was refloated by jettisoning and lightering supplies to lighten ship, with  assistance from the [[USS Bear (1874)|USRC ''Bear'']] and a crew from the Nome [[United States Life-Saving Service|Lifesaving]] station.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' September 22, 1914&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefansson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cochran pp82-83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Healy, R.J 1915&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Anderson...&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate fate===
By 1916, the ''Corwin'' was majority-owned by Schubach &amp; Hamilton, who sold her to Mexican owners. She burned in [[drydock]] at [[Salina Cruz]] that same year.&lt;ref&gt;Tacoma Public Library (e)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Several places in Alaska and [[Yukon]] are named for the ''Corwin'', including Corwin Bluff (the bluff near Cape Lisburne containing the Corwin Coal Mine), Corwin Rock in the Aleutian Islands, and possibly [[Cape Corwin]] on [[Nunivak Island]].  [[Kivalina]] lagoon was called Corwin Lagoon by the United States [[Coast and Geodetic Survey]] from 1884 to about 1950.  The Corwin Cliffs in the [[Saint Elias Mountains]], Yukon were named for the ''Corwin'' by [[Israel Russell|I.C Russell]] in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Baker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Natural Resources Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporaneous model of the Corwin built by Captain Thomas Mountain is in the collection of the Oregon State Historical Society and was displayed at the Alaska State Museum in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Alaska State Museums; Captain Mountain survived the sinking of the [[USS Peacock (1828)|''Peacock'']] in 1841 during the [[United States Exploring Expedition]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Viduzia''' (or, in its current form; Vidusa) is a chain of mountains in Eastern [[Herzegovina]] (In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]), North of Popovo Polje roughly between the little cities of Stolac and Trebinje.

== History ==
Viduzia has been inhabited since ancient times. It was a boundary between two Illyrian Tribes, inhabited by [[Docleatae]] and [[Pleraei]]. After the down fall of [[Illyria#Illyrian kingdoms|Illyrian kingdom]]s, Roman Settlers from the nearby town of Travunia (Today's; [[Trebinje]]), moved in and established homesteads and farms.

Later on, as Roman Rule decreased, autonomous regions started to form in the Balkans. In the 10th century the highlands were added to [[Travunia]], which at that time was still largely untouched by Slavic invasions. 
By 968, Croatian King Krešimir exiled his son, Prince Leghec to Trebinje, where he fell in love with Lovizzia, a court maid that gave him seven sons. Leghec raised a rebellion of the people and created a vassalage of the Croatian Kingdom, but the Croatian occupation was expelled and dynastic control re-established with the help of Ragusa subsequently with Boleslav's son Sylvester; who ruled justly.

Perhaps; Ragusa (with an overwhelming Romanised population), felt threatened by Croatian Expansion. After all, Croatians, like many other Slavic tribes, only converted to Christianity in name, and were still known as pirates, and invaders. 
Or perhaps, Ragusa wanted to expand themselves.

In any case; by the 14th century, Ragusa had made its name by expanding well, right along the coast, while Travunia got swallowed by the long awaited Slavic Invasions.

For the proceeding five centuries, Viduzia stayed isolated, as the local inhabitants slowly started drifting south-westwards, into the Peljesac Peninsula, and finally (during the Ottoman invasions) into the Island of Korcula and beyond.

== Geography ==
Its terrain is dotted with ancient church ruins and fortifications, starting from around 200BC onwards.

==Climate==
The climate of Viduzia is typically [[Mediterranean]], warm and dry. However, the legendary [[Bura (wind)|Bura]] is a strong, cold [[wind]] from the north that occurs mostly in the winter and spring. The higher regions of Vudizia get snow in winter. Temperature can be as high as 44&amp;nbsp;°C.

The climate in Viduzia results from the combination of three factors:

- high annual daylight hours

- limited precipitation (snow, rain, etc.); in winter the wind drives out the clouds after short but intense downpours.

- dry weather (the area could have dryness one month and rain the following, but still have significant dryness overall)

The '''Voordelta''' is the coastal area in the [[North Sea]], protected under [[Natura 2000]]. It is located to the west of the islands of the provinces of [[South Holland]] and [[Zeeland]], around the deltas of [[Haringvliet]], [[Grevelingen]], and [[Oosterschelde]]. The total area of Voordelta is about 900&amp;nbsp;km².
