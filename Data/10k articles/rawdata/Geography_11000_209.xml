'''Bing Maps''' (previously ''Live Search Maps'', ''Windows Live Maps'', ''Windows Live Local'', and ''MSN Virtual Earth'') is a [[web mapping]] service provided as a part of [[Microsoft]]'s [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] suite of search engines and powered by the [[Bing Maps for Enterprise]] framework.

==Features==

===Street maps===
Users can browse and search topographically-shaded [[street map]]s for many cities worldwide. Maps include certain points of interest built in, such as metro stations, stadiums, hospitals, and other facilities. It is also possible to browse public user-created points of interest. Searches can cover public collections, businesses or types of business, locations, or people. Five street map views are available: Road View, Aerial View, Bird’s Eye View, Street Side View, and 3D View.

====Road view====
:Road view is the default map view and displays vector imagery of roads, buildings, and geography. The data from which the default road map is rendered is licensed from [[Navteq]]. In certain parts of the world, road view maps from alternative data providers are also available. For example, when viewing a map of [[London]], the user may see road data from the [[Collins Bartholomew]] London Street Map. In all parts of the UK, road data from the [[Ordnance survey|Ordnance Survey]] can also be displayed. A Bing Maps app is available that will display road data from [[OpenStreetMap]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bing.com/toolbox/blogs/maps/archive/2010/08/02/bing-maps-adds-open-street-maps-layer.aspx Bing.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021120249/http://www.bing.com/toolbox/blogs/maps/archive/2010/08/02/bing-maps-adds-open-street-maps-layer.aspx |date=2010-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aerial view====
:Aerial view overlays satellite imagery onto the map and highlights roads and major landmarks for easy identification amongst the satellite images. Since end of November 2010, [[OpenStreetMap]] mappers have been able to use imagery of Bing Aerial as a map background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opengeodata.org/microsoft-imagery-details|title=Microsoft Imagery details - OpenStreetMap Blog|author=|date=|website=opengeodata.org|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526081340/http://opengeodata.org/microsoft-imagery-details|archivedate=26 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:At the end of January 2012, both Bing Aerial and Birds Eye View imagery at military bases in Germany became blurred. This was on request of the German government obviously using data of OpenStreetMap.&lt;ref&gt;Comparing blurred regions of Bing imagery with polygons of military landuses from OpenStreetMap-data plus some details [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bing/2012_Germany_Military_Blurring at the OSM Wiki] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204033042/http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bing/2012_Germany_Military_Blurring |date=2012-02-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bird's-eye view====
:[[Bird's-eye view]] displays aerial imagery captured from low-flying aircraft. Unlike the top-down aerial view captured by satellite, Bird's-eye images are taken at an oblique 45-degree angle, showing the sides and roofs of buildings giving better [[depth perception]] for geography. With Bird's Eye views, many details such as signs, advertisements and pedestrians are clearly visible.  Unfortunately, the Bird's Eye view is no longer available in many areas where there was previously Bird's Eye photography (12/11/17).

====Streetside ====
[[File:Bing Maps Streetside.png|thumb|right|Bing Maps showing Streetside's view near the [[Palace of Westminster]]]]
[[File:Bing Maps Streetside Car.jpg|thumb|upright|Bing Maps Streetside car with cameras on the roof]]
:Streetside provides 360-degree imagery of street-level scenes taken from special cameras mounted on moving vehicles. Launched in December 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.microsoft.com/2009/12/02/bing-maps-rolls-out-enhanced-aerial-and-street-level-views/|title=Bing Maps Rolls Out Enhanced Aerial and Street-Level Views - Stories|author=|date=2 December 2009|website=microsoft.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111092316/http://news.microsoft.com/2009/12/02/bing-maps-rolls-out-enhanced-aerial-and-street-level-views/|archivedate=11 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it contains imagery for selected metro areas in the United States as well as selected areas in Vancouver and Whistler, British Columbia associated with the 2010 Winter Olympic Games (example: [http://www.bing.com/maps/explore/#5003/o=&amp;a=&amp;s=w&amp;n=0/5872/lat=49.17425&amp;lon=-123.149721&amp;alt=-17.09&amp;z=30&amp;h=-60.1&amp;p=1.4&amp;pid=5082 Richmond Olympic Oval]). Selected cities in Europe were also made available in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/maps/archive/2012/05/08/new-imagery-amp-streetside-coverage-on-bing-maps.aspx |title=New Bird’s Eye Imagery &amp; Streetside Coverage on Bing Maps! |date=May 8, 2012 |work=Bing Maps Blog |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=9 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812001749/http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/maps/archive/2012/05/08/new-imagery-amp-streetside-coverage-on-bing-maps.aspx |archivedate=12 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:Between August and September 2011, German customers were allowed to appeal against integration of their house or flat in Bing Streetside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netzwelt.de/news/87752-bing-streetside-widerspruch-gegen-kartendienst-ab-sofort-moeglich.html Bing StreetSide: Appeal is possible until end of September] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402050503/http://www.netzwelt.de/news/87752-bing-streetside-widerspruch-gegen-kartendienst-ab-sofort-moeglich.html |date=2012-04-02 }}, Netzwelt, retrieved September 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to some officials, the number of appeals was significantly lower than with [[Google Street View]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netzwelt.de/news/88161-vorabwiderspruch-bing-streetside-microsoft-profitiert-google.html Only 40,000 Appeals for Bing Steetside] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402050924/http://www.netzwelt.de/news/88161-vorabwiderspruch-bing-streetside-microsoft-profitiert-google.html |date=2012-04-02 }}, Netzwelt, August 28, 2011 (german)&lt;/ref&gt; Only 40,000 requests were sent to Microsoft.
:For OpenStreetMap editors, display of Streetside tracks and images can be enabled via a map data layer checkbox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/04/openstreetmap-now-lets-you-edit-maps-with-microsofts-bing-streetside-imagery/|title=OpenStreetMap now lets you edit maps with Microsoft's Bing Streetside imagery {{!}} VentureBeat|date=2018-07-04|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Venue maps====
:Venue maps provides a way of seeing the layout of the venue. Currently, Bing Maps provides maps &amp; level wise layouts of over 5300 venues across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bing.com/blogs/site_blogs/b/maps/archive/2013/06/11/largest-shipment-of-bird-s-eye-100-000-dvds-of-imagery.aspx |title=Bing Maps Publishes Equivalent of 100,000 DVD’s of Bird’s Eye Imagery - Maps Blog |publisher=Bing.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2014-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209051300/http://www.bing.com/blogs/site_blogs/b/maps/archive/2013/06/11/largest-shipment-of-bird-s-eye-100-000-dvds-of-imagery.aspx |archivedate=2014-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The categories are: ''Airports, Amusement Parks, Buildings, Convention Centers, Hospitals, Malls, Museums, Parks, Racecourses, Racetracks, Resorts, Shopping Centers, Shopping Districts, Stadiums, Universities and Zoos.''

====3D maps====
:The 3D maps feature allows users to see the environment (e.g. buildings) in [[3D model|3D]], with the added ability to rotate and tilt the angle in addition to panning and zooming. To attempt to achieve near-photorealism, all 3D buildings are [[texture mapping|textured]] using composites of [[aerial photography]]. To view the 3D maps, users must install a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]], then enable the "3D" option on "Bing Maps". In addition to exploring the maps using a mouse and keyboard, it is possible to navigate the 3D environment using an [[Xbox 360 controller]] or another [[game controller]] in [[Windows 7]] , [[Windows Vista]] or [[Windows XP]].

:More than 60 cities worldwide could be viewed in 3D, including most of the major cities in the [[United States]] and a few cities in [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.live.com/?v=2&amp;cid=320432CACC287CB4!101&amp;encType=1 List of 3D cities] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516170412/http://maps.live.com/?v=2&amp;cid=320432CACC287CB4!101&amp;encType=1 |date=2016-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some additional cities have had a select few important landmarks modelled in 3D, such as the [[Colosseum]] in [[Rome]]. Terrain data is available for the entire world. It is also possible to use a 3D modelling program called [http://www.3dvia.com/software/3dvia-shape-for-maps/ 3DVIA Shape for Maps] to add one's own models to the 3D map. Since 2014, new 3D imagery has been introduced to a number of new cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/bing-maps-shows-super-bowl-spirit-new-venue-map-streetside-hi-res-venue-imagery-213827|title=Bing Maps Shows Super Bowl Spirit With New Venue Map, Streetside &amp; Hi-Res Venue Imagery - Search Engine Land|author=|date=28 January 2015|website=searchengineland.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128162450/https://searchengineland.com/bing-maps-shows-super-bowl-spirit-new-venue-map-streetside-hi-res-venue-imagery-213827|archivedate=28 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/08/20/microsoft-goes-after-google-with-bing-maps-update-94-new-cities-get-street-view-3d-maps/|title=Microsoft chases after Google in new, huge Bing Maps update|author=|date=20 August 2014|website=venturebeat.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803102721/https://venturebeat.com/2014/08/20/microsoft-goes-after-google-with-bing-maps-update-94-new-cities-get-street-view-3d-maps/|archivedate=3 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Driving, walking, and transit directions===
Users can get directions between two or more locations. In September 2010, Bing Maps added public transit directions (bus, subway, and local rail) to its available direction options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/maps/archive/2010/09/16/bing-maps-gets-transit-directions.aspx|title=Bing Maps Gets Transit Directions|author=|date=|website=www.bing.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007055156/http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/maps/archive/2010/09/16/bing-maps-gets-transit-directions.aspx|archivedate=7 October 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently transit directions are only available in 11 cities: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Newark Metro Area, New York Metro Area, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver BC, and Washington DC.
It is also available in other countries such as Spain, Germany, Italy, Austria, Brazil, Mexico and some others.

===Map apps===
{{Main|Windows Maps}}
Bing Map Apps is a collection of 1st and 3rd party applications that add additional functionality and content to Bing Maps. Examples of map apps include a parking finder, a taxi fare calculator, an app that maps out Facebook friends, and an app which lets users explore the day's newspaper front pages from around the world. These apps are only accessible through Bing Maps [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]]. A source code is available on [[Microsoft Developer Network]] to explain integration of Maps in Web Applications. A sample ongoing project on locating Blood Donors on Maps is available here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ASPNET-MVC-4-with-Bing-Maps-947ae78c/ ASP.NET MVC 4 with Bing Maps in C# for Visual Studio 2010] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120319015221/http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ASPNET-MVC-4-with-Bing-Maps-947ae78c/ |date=2012-03-19 }}. Code.msdn.microsoft.com (2012-05-22). Retrieved on 2013-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traffic information and ClearFlow===
Bing Maps shows users current traffic information for major highways and roads. The feature uses 4 color codes (black, red, yellow, green) to indicate traffic volume, from heaviest traffic to lightest traffic.
Microsoft announced in March 2008 that it will release its latest software technology called "ClearFlow".{{Update inline|inaccurate=y|date=May 2013}} It is a Web-based service for traffic-based driving directions available on Bing.com in 72 cities across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/maps/|title=Maps|author=|date=|website=www.bing.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505025009/https://www.bing.com/maps|archivedate=5 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool took five years for Microsoft’s [[Artificial Intelligence]] team to develop. ClearFlow provides real-time traffic data to help drivers avoid traffic congestion. ClearFlow gives information for alternative routes and supplies traffic conditions on city streets adjacent to highways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/technology/10maps.html|title=Microsoft Introduces Tool for Avoiding Traffic Jams|author=Markoff, John|publisher=New York Times|date=2008-04-10|accessdate=2008-04-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409084911/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/technology/10maps.html|archivedate=2009-04-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearflow anticipates traffic patterns, while taking into account sporting/arena events, time of day and weather conditions, and then reflects the back ups and their consequential spill over onto city streets. Often, ClearFlow found it may be faster to stay on the highway instead of seeking alternative side street routes, which involve traffic lights and congestion as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2008/04/10/microsoft-clearflow-maps/|title=Microsoft Implements 'Clearflow' Traffic Artificial Intelligence in Live Maps|author=Glazowski, Paul|publisher=Marshable Social Networking News|date=2008-04-10|accessdate=2008-04-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412045156/http://mashable.com/2008/04/10/microsoft-clearflow-maps/|archivedate=2008-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sharing and embedding maps===
Bing Maps allows users to share maps and embed maps into their websites. By clicking the e-mail icon in the bottom-left corner of Bing Maps, a window will open that displays a shareable URL so others can access the map currently being viewed. This window also provides HTML code to embed a small version of the map onto any web page.

===Design===
In August 2010, Bing Maps launched an overhauled design for its default view. The new colors create a more visually appealing backdrop for information delivery that helps content ‘pop’ on the map.  The backdrop provides clear differentiation for pushpins, labels and red, yellow and green traffic overlays.  These design principles also works well in black and white and creates differentiation for those with the most common forms of color blindness.
Also, larger fonts correspond to larger roads to help customers more easily identify main roads in cities.  More readable labels eliminate the need for bolding and less-attractive glows. The inclusion of neighborhood labels allows users to quickly find or convey locations in a commonly used and highly relevant format.

==Other features==

===People, business, and location search===
The search box at the top of Bing Maps can be used to locate places, businesses and landmarks, and people. Search results appear both on a left-side rail and as pushpins on the map (linked together by numbers). Search results often include addresses, contact information, and reviews for businesses and landmarks. For relevant searches, the user will also see a description of the landmark or place (powered by Wikipedia) if a Wikipedia article exists.
The search process can also be guided using local directories for numerous categories (restaurants, hotels, tourist attractions, retail stores, etc.).

===User contributions===
Bing Maps users can also view and add "user contributed" entries to the map. These [[User-generated content|user-contributions]] must be toggled on by users. Such items can include businesses, landmarks, buildings, and locations. Users can browse user-contributions by tags and subscribe to [[RSS feed]]s to receive updates of new user-contributions to a specific area.

===Dynamic labels===
In August 2010, Bing Maps added dynamic labels to its Silverlight experience (bing.com/maps/explore). Turn on the dynamic labels beta from the map style selector on bing.com/maps/explore and the labels become clickable.  This allows users to quickly zoom down to a region or location anywhere on the map with just a few clicks. Zooming back out in a single click is also possible by using the ‘breadcrumb’ trail at the top left of the map.

==AJAX and Silverlight versions==
Bing Maps has two separate versions for users: an [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] version (located at Bing.com/Maps) and an opt-in [[Silverlight]] version (located at Bing.com/Maps/Explore—not available anymore) that requires Microsoft Silverlight to be installed. The Silverlight version is positioned to offer richer, more dynamic features and a smoother experience. In November 2010, the AJAX and Silverlight versions were combined into a semi-hybrid site where Silverlight features such as Map Apps and Streetside could be enabled through the Bing.com/Maps site - these features still required Silverlight to be installed, but does not require use of a separate Bing Maps site.

The AJAX and Silverlight site share the following features: Road View, Aerial View, Bird’s-Eye View, Sharing Maps, People/Business/Location Search, Building Footprints, Driving Directions, Walking Directions.

Silverlight users exclusively can use Map Apps, StreetSide View, Photosynths, and Dynamic Labels.

==Map apps==

===Access===
Bing Map Apps are accessed either through the "Map Apps" button in the Bing Maps Explore Bar or through direct perma-links. The Map Apps button is only viewable if the user is in the Bing Maps Silverlight experience or in [[Windows 8]].

==History==
Bing Maps was based on existing [[Microsoft]] technologies such as [[Microsoft MapPoint]], and [[TerraServer-USA|TerraServer]]. The original version lacked many of its distinguishing features, including birds' eye view and 3D maps, and the Collections functionality was limited to a single "Scratchpad" of points of interest. Upon its release in December 2005, Windows Live Local became the public face of the Virtual Earth platform. On November 6, 2006, Microsoft added the ability to view the maps in [[3D model|3D]] using a [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] managed control and managed interfaces to [[Direct3D]]. Microsoft subsequently referred to this product officially as "''Live Search Maps''", integrating it as part of its Live Search services. On June 3, 2009, Microsoft officially rebranded Live Search Maps as ''Bing Maps'', and the Virtual Earth platform as ''Bing Maps for Enterprise''.

Currently, Bing Maps uses [[Here (company)|HERE]] (formerly [[Navteq]]) for part of its mapping system

===Imagery updates===
Bing maps frequently update and expand the geographic areas covered by their imagery, with new updates being released on roughly a monthly basis. Each imagery release typically contains more than 10TB of imagery.

However, the necessary time-lapse before images are updated means that aerial and Bird's-Eye images for a particular location can sometimes be several years out-of-date. This is particularly noticeable in locations that have undergone rapid recent development or experienced other dramatic changes since the imagery was taken, such as areas affected by natural disasters.

==Compatibility==
Microsoft states that Bing Maps needs the following environment:&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinehelp.microsoft.com/en-gb/bing/ff808477.aspx Onlinehelp.microsoft.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924211726/http://onlinehelp.microsoft.com/en-gb/bing/ff808477.aspx |date=2010-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Culture Route of the Council of Europe''', sometimes referred to as a '''European Cultural Route''' is a title awarded to [[Cultural tourism|cultural routes]] recognised as significant throughout [[Europe]] by the [[Council of Europe]] through promoting shared culture, history, memory and [[European integration]]. These routes must also match some fundamental values promoted by the Council of Europe such as [[democracy]], [[human rights]] and intercultural exchanges in the framework of cultural tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culture-routes.net/cultural-routes/values|title=Values of Cultural Routes {{!}} Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe|website=culture-routes.net|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Cultural Route of the Council of Europe is not necessarily a physical path to be walked through and can be made up of cultural stakeholders such as museums, municipalities or local governments clustered into one umbrella association. Being awarded the title Cultural Route of the Council of Europe opens the way to a larger visibility, network of cultural stakeholders or even funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culture-routes.net/candidates/application|title=Application {{!}} Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe|website=culture-routes.net|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that the programme was launched by the Council of Europe and not the [[European Union]], even though it contributes to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culture-routes.net/the-institute/partners|title=Partners {{!}} Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe|website=culture-routes.net|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the programme goes beyond the borders of the EU, and even Europe in general as some Routes go as far as [[North Africa]] or the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culture-routes.net/cultural-routes/countries|title=Countries {{!}} Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe|website=culture-routes.net|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme was launched in 1987 and is managed by the [[European Institute of Cultural Routes]] (EICR) based in Luxembourg since 1989. Since 2010, the evaluation and certification-awarding process is made possible by the Enlarged Partial Agreement on Cultural Routes (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culture-routes.net/council-of-europe/epa|title=EPA on Cultural Routes and Evaluation cycle {{!}} Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe|website=culture-routes.net|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, 32 Cultural Routes were certified as listed below. There also are some other non-certified Routes in project that are recorded by the EICR, which is in charge of conducting the application process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culture-routes.net/the-institute/mission|title=Mission {{!}} Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe|website=culture-routes.net|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe are tools of the European cultural cooperation implemented by the Council of Europe with the "European cultural convention" in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/CulturalConvention/Source/Bilan50_EN.pdf|title=50 years of the European Cultural Convention|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 October 1987, the [[Santiago de Compostela]] Declaration established the Santiago De Compostela Pilgrim Routes, the first European Cultural Route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culture-routes.net/sites/default/files/files/1987_COMPOSTELA_DECLARATION.pdf|title=The Santiago de Compostela Declaration|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point on, the Council of Europe gradually implemented a certification of routes with a cultural, social or historical interest with a view to bringing European cultures and peoples closer. The certification criteria have been revised throughout the existence of the programme, the last time was in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culture-routes.net/sites/default/files/files/CMRes(2013)67E.pdf|title=Resolution CM/Res(2013)67|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Institute of Cultural Routes]] (EICR) was set up in 1998 following a political agreement between the Council of Europe and the [[Government of Luxembourg]]. The EICR have been in charge of managing the Cultural Route programme since then, ensuring connexions between the Routes’ associations, its university network, the Council of Europe and since 2010 the EPA statutory bodies. As a result, the institute organises several annual meetings between the programme's stakeholders, helps with the certification of new Cultural Routes, evaluates every three years the certified Routes or promotes the Cultural Routes.

In December 2010, the [[Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe]] adopted a resolution establishing the Enlarged Partial Agreement on Cultural Routes (EPA). This agreement aimed to making the programme's funding and organisation easier. The EPA is based in the EICR and periodically gathers representatives of some of the states that are the more interested in the programme who are empowered to certify new Cultural Routes as well as evaluating already-certified Routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culture-routes.net/council-of-europe/epa|title=EPA on Cultural Routes and Evaluation cycle {{!}} Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe|website=culture-routes.net|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Colombia}} 
'''[[Colombia]]''' is a [[unitary republic]] made up of thirty-two '''[[department (country subdivision)|department]]s''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''departamentos'', sing. ''[[departamento]]'') and a '''Capital District''' (''[[Distrito Capital]]'').&lt;ref name="Portal-Co"&gt;{{cite web|title=Division Política de Colombia|publisher=Portal ColombiaYA.com |language=es |url=http://www.colombiaya.com/seccion-colombia/division-politica.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310072713/http://www.colombiaya.com/seccion-colombia/division-politica.html |archivedate=10 March 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each department has a Governor (''gobernador'') and a Department Assembly (''Asamblea Departamental''), elected by popular vote for a four-year period. The governor cannot be re-elected in consecutive periods. Departments are [[country subdivision]]s and are granted a certain degree of autonomy.

Departments are formed by a grouping of [[municipalities of Colombia|municipalities]] (''municipios'', sing. ''[[municipio]]''). Municipal government is headed by [[mayor]] (''alcalde'') and administered by a [[Municipal Council]] (''concejo municipal''), both of which are elected for four-year periods.

=== Territorios indígenas ===
{{main article|Indigenous territory (Colombia)}}
The indigenous territories are at the third level of administrative division in Colombia, as are the municipalities. Indigenous territories are created by agreement between the government and indigenous communities. In cases where indigenous territories covering more than one department or municipality, local governments jointly administer them with the indigenous councils, as set out in Articles 329 and 330 of the [[Colombian Constitution of 1991]]. Also indigenous territories may achieve local [[Autonomy#Politics|autonomy]] if they meet the requirements of the law.

Article 329 of the 1991 constitution recognizes the collective indigenous ownership of indigenous territories and repeats that are inalienable. Law 160 of 1994 created the National System of Agrarian Reform and Rural Development Campesino, and replaced Law 135 of 1961 on Agrarian Social Reform; it establishes and sets out the functions of INCORA, one of the most important being to declare which territories will acquire the status of indigenous protection and what extension of existing ones will be allowed. Decree 2164 of 1995 interprets Law 160 of 1994, providing, among other things, a legal definition of indigenous territories.&lt;ref&gt;Decree 2164 of 1995 provides "Reserva Indígena. Es un globo de terreno baldío ocupado por una o varias comunidades indígenas que fué delimitado y legalmente asignado por el INCORA a aquellas para que ejerzan en él los derechos de uso y usufructo con exclusión de terceros. Las reservas indígenas constituyen tierras comunales de grupos étnicos, para los fines previstos en el artículo 63 de la Constitución Política y la ley 21 de 1991. […] Territorios Indígenas. Son las áreas poseidas en forma regular y permanente por una comunidad, parcialidad o grupo indígena y aquellas que, aunque no se encuentren poseidas en esa forma, constituyen el ámbito tradicional de sus actividades sociales, económicas y culturales. " Art. 21: "Los resguardos son una institución legal y sociopolítica de carácter especial, conformada por una o más comunidades indígenas, que con un título de propiedad colectiva que goza de las garantías de la propiedad privada, poseen su territorio y se rigen para el manejo de éste y su vida interna por una organización autónoma amparada por el fuero indígena y su sistema normativo propio."&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous territories in Colombia are mostly in the departments of Amazonas, Cauca, La Guajira, Guaviare and Vaupés.&lt;ref name="Portal-Co" /&gt;

== History ==

===República de la Gran Colombia===
{{main article|Subdivisions of Gran Colombia}}
When it was first established in 1819, República de la [[Gran Colombia]] had three departments. [[Venezuela Department (1820)|Venezuela]], [[Cundinamarca Department (1820)|Cundinamarca]] (now Colombia) and [[Quito Department|Quito]] (now Ecuador).&lt;ref name="Guhl"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Guhl Nannetti |first=Ernesto |year = 1991 |title=Las fronteras políticas y los límites naturales: escritos geograficos |trans-title = Political Boundaries and Their Natural Limits: Geographic writings |chapter=Capítulo XII: División Política de la Gran Colombia |language=es |publisher= Fondo FEN |location=Bogotá |isbn=978-958-9129-22-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1824 the Distrito del Centro (which became Colombia) was divided into five departments, and further divided into seventeen provinces. One department, [[Istmo Department]], consisting of two provinces later became [[Panama]].&lt;ref name="Aguilera-Pena"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Aguilera Peña |first=Mario |date=January 2002 |title=División política administrativa de Colombia |work=Credential Historia |issue=145 |publisher=Banco de la República |location=Bogotá |language=es |url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/enero2002/division.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216082657/http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/enero2002/division.htm |archivedate=16 February 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===República de la Nueva Granada===
With the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1826 by the Revolution of the Morrocoyes (''La Cosiata''), New Granada kept its 17 provinces. In 1832 the provinces of Vélez and Barbacoas were created, and in 1835 those of Buenaventura and Pasto were added. In 1843 those of Cauca, Mompós and Túquerres were created. At this time the cantons (''cantones'') and parish districts were created, which provided the basis for the present-day municipalities.&lt;ref name="Aguilera-Pena" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Estadística"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Estadística de Colombia |trans-title=Colombian Statistics |author=Oficina Nacional de Estadística (Office of National Statistics) |language=es |location=Bogotá |publisher=Oficina Nacional de Estadística |year=1876 |url=ftp://ftp.colombiestad.gov.co/books/LD_70104_1876.PDF |accessdate=23 November 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1853 the number of provinces had increased to thirty-six, namely:Antioquia, Azuero, Barbacoas, Bogotá, Buenaventura, Cartagena, Casanare, Cauca, Chiriquí, Chocó, Córdova, Cundinamarca, García Rovira, Mariquita, Medellín, Mompós, Neiva, Ocaña, Pamplona, Panamá, Pasto, Popayán, Riohacha, Sabanilla, Santa Marta, Santander, Socorro, Soto, Tequendama, Tunja, Tundama, Túquerres, Valle de Upar, Veraguas, Vélez and Zipaquirá.&lt;ref name="Estadística" /&gt; However, the new constitution of 1853 introduced federalism, which lead to the consolidation of provinces into states. By 1858 this process was complete, with a resulting eight federal states: Panamá was formed in 1855, Antioquia in 1856, Santander in May 1857, and Bolívar, Boyacá, Cauca, Cundinamarca and Magdalena were formed in June 1858. 1861 saw the creation of the final federal state of Tolima.&lt;ref name="Domínguez"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Domínguez, Camilo |author2=Chaparro, Jeffer |author3=Gómez, Carla |year=2006 |title=Construcción y deconstrucción territorial del Caribe Colombiano durante el siglo XIX |journal=Scripta Nova (Revista Electrónica de Geografía y Ciencias Sociales) |volume=10 |issue=218 (75)|url=http://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-218-75.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===República de Colombia===
The [[Colombian Constitution of 1886]] converted the [[states of Colombia]] into departments, with the state presidents renamed as governors. The states formed the following original departments:

* [[Antioquia Department]]
* [[Bolívar Department]]
* [[Boyacá Department]]
* [[Cauca Department]]
* [[Cundinamarca Department]]
* [[Magdalena Department]]
* [[Panamá Department]]
* [[Santander Department]]
* [[Tolima Department]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7189">'''Friends of Nature''' (international abbreviation: '''NFI''', for [[German language|German]]: '''Naturfreunde International''') is an international movement with a background in the [[Social Democrats|Social Democratic movement]], which aims to make the enjoyment of [[nature]] accessible to the wider community by providing appropriate [[recreation]]al and [[travel]] facilities.

==Background==
It is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit organisation]] which, in addition to encouraging sustainable tourism, which has a minimal effect on the environment, also aims to promote [[Internationalism (politics)|international friendship]] and understanding.

It is also known as ''Naturfreunde'' ([[German language|German]]), ''Les Amis de la Nature'' ([[French language|French]]), ''Amici della Natura'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''La Naturamikoj'' ([[Esperanto]]), and ''Natuurvrienden'' or NIVON ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]).

The organisation began in [[Austria]] in 1895 as ''Naturfreunde'' among people associated with the emerging [[Social Democrats|Social Democratic movement]] who enjoyed outdoor activities and began to build their own huts and overnight chalets. The movement spread and it now has 350.000 members, 45 member organisations and runs some 700 houses mainly in [[Europe]]. The houses vary in size and facilities. The ''International Friends of Nature'' (IFN), based in [[Vienna]], is the [[umbrella organisation]] of the national Friends of Nature federations.

Publications of the various sections include a handbook detailing all the houses and magazines published by various sections (such as Naturefriends - Great Britain - Bulletin, Les Amis de La Nature, La Migranto – in [[Esperanto]] by "Esperantistoj Naturamikoj" etc.).

===Tradition===
The '''Friends of Nature''' organisation was founded in [[Vienna]] in 1895.The group was founded by three activists, [[Karl Renner]], a law student and future President of Austria, [[Georg Schmiedl]], a schoolteacher, and [[Alois Rohrauer]], a blacksmith.
&lt;ref&gt;John Alexander Williams (2007) ''Turning to Nature in Germany: Hiking, Nudism, and Conservation, 1900-1940''. Stanford University Press,pp. 71-2. {{ISBN|0-8047-0015-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the age of incipient [[tourism]] the organisation succeeded in making nature accessible to broader population strata by providing requisite recreational and travel facilities. Even then, the organisation's activities were aimed at getting people to beautiful natural settings, at awakening their love of nature and at imparting to them knowledge about nature and culture. Parallel with the rise of the modern industrialised society and of commercial tourism the Friends of Nature developed a professional commitment to nature and environment protection and had a major share in advancing the theory and practice of alternative forms of ecological tourism. 

The organisation was banned by the [[Nazis]] in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;Boria Sax (2000). ''Animals in the Third Reich: Pets, Scapegoats, and the Holocaust''. Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 41. {{ISBN|0-8264-1289-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but revived in 1945.

===Aims===
The work of the Friends of Nature rests on the conviction that people's opportunities of personal development are inextricably linked with the protection of nature and the conservation of natural resources. Hence, the Friends of Nature have, since their inception, taken a stand for the conservation of an environment worth living in, for peace and international understanding, for the social and democratic rights of all people, and for a meaningful organisation of leisure time. Building on their century-old tradition, the Friends of Nature are nowadays committed to the implementation of sustainable development, in particular to transboundary environmental solutions and to an environmentally and socially sound tourism.

===Commitment to sustainable development===
The biennial proclamation of a "Landscape of the Year" exemplifies how sustainable regional development can be put into practice. International environmental campaigns, such as "100,000 Trees for Europe" or "Blue Rivers for Europe" are intended to enhance environmental awareness in Europe and to offer members opportunities to take action in the interest of the environment. In 1995, the Friends of Nature set up the "Institute for Integrative Tourism" (IITF) with the intent to input the concept of sustainability into research and training in this field. The "Manifesto for a New Europe" (1993) and the "Manifesto for a Social, Ecological and Peaceful Future" (1996), proposals submitted to the Inter-governmental Conference of the European Union, and the"Green Paper - The Alps" are examples of international lobbying by the Friends of Nature.

===Friends of Nature worldwide===
With 350.000 members organised in approximately 45 member organisations, the Friends of Nature are among the biggest non-profit and non-governmental organisations worldwide. Apart from seminars and information material they provide environmentally sound leisure-time and travel programmes for their members and run over 700 Nature Friends Houses in Europe and overseas.

In the 1970s a group of young members of four Naturefriends' organisations (Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands) created a youth umbrella to network and support youth work in the movement. Through the course of the time the organisation got formalised and extended to current 26 member and partner organisations.

The International Young Naturefriends (IYNF) cooperated and were supported by the Council of Europe's Directorate Youth and Sport. In the European Youth Forum Young Naturefriends belonged to the socialist family or the family of non-formal education organisations. Currently the Secretariat of IYNF is located in Prague, Czech Republic, the seat of the organisation is however a common with NFI, in Vienna.

International Young Naturefriends provides trainings and international activities to the members of its network on different topics every year. They are also active in international networks such as European Youth Forum and UNFCCC, actively lobbying for the interests of the young people of both Europe and world, concerned with environmental issues and the climatic change.

'''GPS Block IIF''', or '''GPS IIF''' is an interim class of [[GPS (satellite)]], which are used to keep the Navstar [[Global Positioning System]] operational until the [[GPS Block IIIA]] satellites become operational. They are being built by [[Boeing]], and will be operated by the [[United States Air Force]] following their launch by [[United Launch Alliance]], using [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name="Boeing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Positioning System (GPS) IIF|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/gps/index.html|publisher=Boeing|accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the final component of the Block II GPS constellation to be launched. On February 5, 2016, the final satellite in the IIF-block was successfully launched, completing the block.

The spacecraft have a mass of {{convert|1630|kg}} and a design life of 12 years. Like earlier GPS satellites, Block IIF spacecraft operate in [[semi-synchronous orbit|semi-synchronous]] [[medium Earth orbit]]s, with an altitude of approximately {{convert|20460|km|sp=us}}, and an [[orbital period]] of twelve hours.

The satellites replace the [[GPS (satellite)#Block IIA series|GPS Block IIA]] satellites that were launched between 1990 and 1997 and were designed to last 7.5 years.&lt;ref name="dailytech1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/First+Block+2F+GPS+Satellite+Launched+Needed+to+Prevent+System+Failure/article18483.htm |title=First Block 2F GPS Satellite Launched, Needed to Prevent System Failure |publisher=DailyTech |date= |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final satellite of the Block IIA series was decommissioned on January 25, 2016.&lt;ref name="IIA-status"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?Do=constellationStatus | title=GPS CONSTELLATION STATUS | work=U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center | accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of GPS satellites|operational constellation]] now includes Block IIR, IIRM and IIF variants.

Because the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles are more powerful than the [[Delta II]], which was used to orbit earlier Block II GPS satellites, they can place the satellites directly into their operational orbits. As a result, Block IIF satellites do not carry [[apogee kick motor]]s. The original contract for Block IIF, signed in 1996, called for 33 spacecraft. This was later reduced to 12, and program delays and technical problems pushed the first launch from 2006 to 2010.&lt;ref name="GSORG"&gt;{{cite web |last=Pike |first=John |title=GPS Block II F |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/gps_2f.htm |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New characteristics==
* Broadcasting L5 "[[GPS signals#L5, Safety of Life|safety of life]]" navigation signal demonstrated on [[USA-203]]&lt;ref name="dailytech1"/&gt;
* Broadcasting a new [[GPS signals|M-code]] signal&lt;ref name="dailytech1"/&gt;
* Doubling in the predicted accuracy&lt;ref name="SV1MOB"/&gt;
* Better resistance to [[Radio jamming|jamming]]&lt;ref name="dailytech1"/&gt;
* Reprogrammable processors that can receive software uploads&lt;ref name="dailytech1"/&gt;
* The first GPS satellites not to have [[Error analysis for the Global Positioning System#Selective availability|Selective Availability]] (SA) hardware installed, which degraded civilian accuracy when turned on in the original satellite fleet&lt;ref name="dailytech1"/&gt;

== Launch history ==
Overall, 12 GPS Block IIF satellites were launched, all of which are currently operational.

El Salvador borders the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific Ocean]] to the south and southwest, with [[Guatemala]] to the north-northwest and [[Honduras]] to the north-northeast. In the southeast, the [[Golfo de Fonseca]] separates it from [[Nicaragua]]. [[El Salvador]] is the smallest Central American country and is the only one without a [[coast]]line on the [[Caribbean sea]].

== Plate tectonics ==

El Salvador, along with the rest of Central America, is one of the most seismologically active regions on earth, situated atop three of the large [[tectonics|tectonic]] plates that constitute the Earth's surface.  The motion of these plates causes the area's [[earthquake]] and [[volcano|volcanic]] activity.

Most of Central America and the [[Caribbean Basin]] rests on the relatively motionless [[Caribbean Plate]]. The Pacific Ocean floor, however, is being carried northeast by the underlying motion of the [[Cocos Plate]]. Ocean floor material is largely composed of [[basalt]], which is relatively dense; when it collides with the lighter [[granite]] rocks of Central America, the ocean floor is forced down under the land mass, creating the deep [[Middle America Trench]] that lies off the coast of El Salvador.

The subduction of the Cocos Plate accounts for the frequency of earthquakes near the coast. As the rocks constituting the ocean floor are forced down, they melt, and the molten material pours up through weaknesses in the surface rock, producing volcanoes and [[geyser]]s.

North of El Salvador, Mexico and most of Guatemala are riding on the westward-moving [[North American Plate]] that butts against the northern edge of the stationary [[Caribbean Plate]] in southern Guatemala. The grinding action of these two plates creates a fault (similar to the [[San Andreas Fault|San Andreas fault]] in California) that runs the length of the valley of the Rio Motagua in Guatemala. Motion along this fault is the source of earthquakes in northernmost El Salvador.

El Salvador has a long history of [[List of earthquakes in El Salvador|destructive earthquakes]] and volcanic eruptions. [[San Salvador]] was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and  suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. The country has over twenty volcanoes, although only two, San Miguel and [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]], have been active in recent years. From the early nineteenth century to the mid-1950s, Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name "Lighthouse of the Pacific." Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea, and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone.

==Physical features==

Two parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central [[plateau]] between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central plateau, covering 85 percent of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands.

The northern range of mountains, the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre]], form a continuous chain along the border with Honduras. Elevations in this region range from 1,600 to 2,700 meters. The area was once heavily forested, but [[overexploitation]] led to extensive erosion, and it has become semibarren. As a result, it is the country's most sparsely populated zone, with little farming or other development.

The southern range of mountains is actually a discontinuous chain of more than twenty volcanoes, clustered into five groups. The westernmost group, near the Guatemalan border, contains [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]] and Santa Ana, which at 2,365 meters is the highest volcano in El Salvador. Between the cones lie [[alluvial]] basins and rolling hills eroded from ash deposits. The volcanic soil is rich, and much of El Salvador's [[coffee]] is planted on these slopes.

The central plateau constitutes only 25 percent of the land area but contains the heaviest concentration of population and the country's largest cities. This plain is about 50 kilometers wide and has an average elevation of 600 meters. Terrain here is rolling, with occasional escarpments, [[lava]] fields, and [[geysers]].

A narrow plain extends from the coastal volcanic range to the Pacific Ocean. This region has a width ranging from one to thirty-two kilometers with the widest section in the east, adjacent to the [[Golfo de Fonseca]]. Near [[La Libertad, La Libertad|La Libertad]], however, the mass of the mountains push the lowlands out; the slopes of adjacent volcanoes come down directly to the ocean. Surfaces in the Pacific lowlands are generally flat or gently rolling and result from the [[alluvial]] deposits of nearby slopes.

El Salvador has over 300 rivers, the most important of which is the [[Rio Lempa]]. Originating in Guatemala, the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains, flows along much of the central plateau, and finally cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific. It is El Salvador's only navigable river, it and its tributaries drain about half the country. Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific.

Numerous lakes of volcanic origin are found in the interior highlands; many of these lakes are surrounded by mountains and have high, steep banks. The largest lake, the [[Lago de Ilopango]], lies just to the east of the capital. Other large lakes include the [[Coatepeque Caldera|Lago de Coatepeque]] in the west and the [[Lake Güija|Lago de Güija]] on the Guatemalan border. The [[Cerrón Grande Hydroelectric Dam|Cerron Grande Dam]] on the Rio Lempa has created a large reservoir, the Embalse Cerron Grande, in northern El Salvador.

[[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]] has erupted at least 51 times since 1770. It earned the nickname "Lighthouse of the Pacific" because it was the most active volcano in Central America.

==Climate==
El Salvador has a [[tropical]] climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot and humid; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate.

The rainy season, known locally as ''invierno'', or winter, extends from May to October. Almost all the annual rainfall and the highest humidity occurs during this time, and yearly rain totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as {{convert|2000|mm|in|1|sp=us}}. Protected areas and the central plateau receive lesser, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms. Although [[hurricane]]s occasionally form in the Pacific, they seldom affect El Salvador, with the notable exception of [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998 (which actually formed over the Atlantic Basin) and [[1973 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Emily|Hurricane Emily]] in 1973.

From November through April, the northeast [[trade winds]] control weather patterns. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in Honduras. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy. This season is known locally as ''verano'', or summer.

Temperatures vary little with season; elevation is the primary determinant. The Pacific lowlands are the hottest region, with annual averages ranging from {{convert|25|to|29|°C|°F|1}}. San Salvador is representative of the central plateau, with an annual average temperature of {{convert|23|°C}} and absolute high and low readings of {{convert|38|and|6|°C|°F|1}}, respectively. Mountain areas are the coolest, with annual averages from {{convert|12|to|23|°C|°F|1}} and minimum temperatures sometimes approaching freezing.

==Other facts==
El Salvador's physical shape form, evokes a similar resemblance to a rugged and miniature version of the U.S State of California. During the 1980s, the country's coastal roads were compared to California's coastal roads by American surfers and El Salvador became known as the wild west of Central America, characterized by roughness and lawlessness.

The total land area of El Salvador is 23,041&amp;nbsp;km², with 20,721&amp;nbsp;km² of land and 320&amp;nbsp;km² of water. This is slightly smaller than the [[U.S. state]] of [[Massachusetts]]. El Salvador has 590&amp;nbsp;km of borders, including 391&amp;nbsp;km of borders with [[Honduras]] and 199&amp;nbsp;km with [[Guatemala]]. El Salvador has a coastline of 307&amp;nbsp;km.

El Salvador claims a [[territorial sea]] of {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|lk=in}}.

'''ISO 3166-2:NR''' is the entry for [[Nauru]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Nauru, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[districts of Nauru|14 districts]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|NR}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Nauru. The second part is two digits (01&amp;ndash;14).

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70561">The following is a summary of notable incidents at any of the [[amusement park]]s and [[water park]]s operated by [[Six Flags|Six Flags Entertainment Corporation]].  In some cases, these incidents occurred while the park was under different management or ownership.

This list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of every such event, but only those that have a significant impact on the parks or park operations, or are otherwise significantly noteworthy. The term ''incidents'' refers to major accidents, injuries, or deaths that occur at a park.  While these incidents were required to be reported to regulatory authorities due to where they occurred, they usually fall into one of the following categories:
# Caused by negligence on the part of the guest. This can be refusal to follow specific ride safety instructions, or deliberate intent to violate park rules.
# The result of a guest's known, or unknown, health issues.
# Negligence on the part of the park, either by ride operator or maintenance safety instructions, or deliberate intent to violate park rules.
# [[Act of God]] or a generic accident (''e.g.'', lightning strike, slipping and falling), that is not a direct result of an action on anybody's part.
{{TOC right}}

&lt;!--Do NOT add an incident without an independent third-party source. Per WP:BURDEN, the editor adding the information is responsible for providing the source to back up the change. Fan sites like themeparkreview.com and aggregator sites like rideaccidents.com are not considered reliable, although such sites often link to sources that may meet WP:RS.

==Great Escape==
{{see also|Great Escape (amusement park)}}
===Sky Ride===
* On June 24th, 2017, a 14-year-old girl from [[Greenwood, Delaware]] fell approximately {{convert|25|ft|m|0}} from her gondola, striking a tree before falling to the ground. The girl had slipped under the chair's safety bar while the ride was in motion. The ride was stopped when park visitors alerted the operators to the incident, while other visitors gathered underneath the girl to prepare to catch her. She ultimately fell into the group of visitors below her, with an unidentified 47-year-old man receiving a back injury from the attempt. The passenger received no serious injuries, and was taken to a local hospital. Park officials stated there did not appear to be a malfunction of the ride, but closed the ride pending review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Le Vampire===
{{main|Le Vampire}}
*On July 6, 2012, a 67-year-old employee of the park was killed at ''Le Vampire''. The employee was reportedly found underneath the attraction in a restricted area, appearing to have suffered head trauma.  Park officials stated that the employee had been struck by the roller coaster. The employee was pronounced dead at the scene; another individual was taken to a hospital to be treated for shock. Officials with the park did not know why the employee entered the restricted area of the ride while it was operational, but they did state that the ride was operating normally and that procedures for entering restricted ride areas, including notification of ride staff, had not been followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Worker+dies+Ronde+accident+Montreal/6895065/story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708203304/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Worker+dies+Ronde+accident+Montreal/6895065/story.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-08 |title=Worker dies in La Ronde accident in Montreal |work=MontrealGazette.com |publisher=Postmedia Network |date=2012-07-06 |accessdate=2012-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Joker's Jinx===
{{main|The Joker's Jinx}}
*On August 10, 2014, at about 3pm, 24 people were trapped on the roller coaster when the train stalled along the course. The train was upright on a curve near one of the highest points on the ride. The local fire department used an [[Fire_engine#Aerial_apparatus|aerial fire apparatus]] to bring down riders one at a time. By 7:30pm local time, all riders had been removed from the ride, which was immediately closed for investigation. Investigators claim that the stalled train was caused by debris on the track. No riders were injured, and all were evaluated by emergency personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

*On May 11, 1984, eight teenage visitors were trapped in the [[Haunted Castle (Six Flags Great Adventure)|Haunted Castle]] attraction, and died when it was destroyed by fire.  Six Flags Great Adventure and its parent company [[Six Flags]] were subsequently indicted for [[Aggravation (law)|aggravated]] [[manslaughter]], accused of [[Recklessness (psychology)|recklessly]] causing the deaths by taking inadequate precautions against a fire.  In the subsequent trial, the prosecution argued that repeated warnings by safety consultants to install sprinklers or smoke alarms had been ignored.  The defendants denied any culpability, and contended that the fire was [[arson]] and that no precautions would have saved lives.

The Department's Office of Safety Compliance further concluded that the accident would not have occurred if proper procedures had been followed.  The park was found to be in violation of the Carnival/Amusement Ride Safety Act and was subsequently charged with the maximum state fine of $1,000.

===Rolling Thunder===
*On August 16, 1981, a 20-year-old park employee from [[Middletown Township, New Jersey]] fell to his death from the Rolling Thunder roller coaster during a routine test run.  An investigation by the New Jersey Labor Department concluded that the man may not have secured himself with the safety bar.  A park representative later confirmed this conclusion, saying that the employee "may have assumed an unauthorized riding position that did not make use of safety restraints."  The ride was inspected, and the Labor Department concluded that the ride was "operationally and mechanically sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

*On June 3, 1984, a mechanical problem caused a train to stop abruptly, causing four people to be hospitalized.  The ride was repaired and put back into service with no more problems.&lt;ref name="4InjSFOG"/&gt;

===Wheelie===
*In May 2009, four children became ill when the attraction failed to stop at the end of its cycle. After returning to a horizontal position, a [[limit switch]] failed and the ride continued to spin for five to ten minutes. The park's first-aid staff treated the children, while one was transported to an area hospital by his parents; the child was not admitted, however. An investigation determined that the ride operator did not engage an emergency stop switch due to a miscommunication between her and her supervisor; the park's ride operators are trained in how to stop their rides in the event of a malfunction. Since then, additional safety features have been added to ensure that the attraction automatically stops within 15 seconds if the limit switch were to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*In the early hours of May 20, 2017, eight passengers were stuck for several hours when heavy winds caused their car to stall out on the top section of the track.

===Roaring Rapids===
*On March 21, 1999, a 28-year-old Arkansas woman died, and 10 other guests were injured, when the raft they were on overturned in 2–3 feet of water due to sudden deflation of the air chambers that support the raft.  The raft then became caught on an underwater pipe, which provided leverage for the rushing water in the ride to flip the boat over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

She heard other restraints click three times but only reported hearing hers click once. A ride attendant assured her that as long as she heard a click, it was secure. Some riders informed investigators that the woman was thrown from the roller coaster as it rounded a turn, and one rider tweeted that he saw the restraint come undone. Other eyewitnesses believed the seat restraint remain locked in the lowered position when the train returned to the station. The ride closed for two months during the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20130719-breaking-news-arlington-police-fire-at-six-flags-for-fatal-incident-texas-giant-said-to-be-involved.ece|title=Breaking: Woman dies on Six Flags'Texas Giant roller coaster|first=Robert| last= Wilonsky | work=dallasnews.com |date=2013-07-19 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myfoxdfw.com/story/22889634/six-flags-woman-died-while-riding-texas-giant|title=Six Flags: Woman died while riding Texas Giant |last1=Kretz |first1=Chelsea |last2=Collins|first2=Calvert|date=July 19, 2013|publisher=KDFW FOX 4|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/flags-texas-witnesses-shocked-roller-coaster-death/story?id=19721888|title=Witnesses on Six Flags Over Texas Roller Coaster Death: 'That Could Have Been Me'|last1=James |first1=Michael |last2=Shaw|first2=Alexis|date=July 20, 2013|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim was found on top of the metal roof of one of the coaster tunnels, near the ''Music Mill Amphitheater''.&lt;ref name="fall"/&gt; Due to its similarity to Texas Giant, [[Iron Rattler]] was closed temporarily by Six Flags Fiesta Texas following the incident.&lt;ref name="fall"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kens5.com/news/Iron-Rattler-remains-closed-as-Six-Flags-investigates-womans-death-216463961.html |title=Iron Rattler remains closed as Six Flags investigates woman's death |date=July 22, 2013 |publisher=KENS |accessdate=July 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130722181139/http://www.kens5.com/news/Iron-Rattler-remains-closed-as-Six-Flags-investigates-womans-death-216463961.html |archivedate=July 22, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news4sanantonio.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/fiesta-texas-temporarily-closes-iron-rattler-878.shtml |title=Fiesta Texas temporarily closes Iron Rattler |date=July 22, 2013 |publisher=News4 San Antonio |accessdate=July 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726004959/http://www.news4sanantonio.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/fiesta-texas-temporarily-closes-iron-rattler-878.shtml |archivedate=July 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It reopened almost a month later with added seat belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kens5.com/news/Six-Flags-adds-seatbelts-to-Iron-Rattler-after-deadly-fall-at-Arlington-park-219794881.html |title=Six Flags adds seat belts to Iron Rattler after deadly fall in Arlington |work=kens.com |date=2013-08-15 |accessdate=2013-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130815235258/http://www.kens5.com/news/Six-Flags-adds-seatbelts-to-Iron-Rattler-after-deadly-fall-at-Arlington-park-219794881.html |archivedate=2013-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ksat.com/news/iron-rattler-reopens-at-fiesta-texas-in-san-antonio/-/478452/21484634/-/4xiymk/-/index.html |title=Iron Rattler reopens at Fiesta Texas in San Antonio |work=ksat.com |last=Ibanez |first=David |date=2013-08-14 |accessdate=2013-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308113020/http://www.ksat.com/news/iron-rattler-reopens-at-fiesta-texas-in-san-antonio/-/478452/21484634/-/4xiymk/-/index.html |archivedate=March 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives from [[Gerstlauer]], the German company that designed and built the ride's trains, participated in the investigation.&lt;ref name="Gerst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/ap/ap/top-news/womans-six-flags-roller-coaster-death-probed/nYxgk/|title=Company to inspect Texas coaster where woman fell|author=Associated Press|work=ajc.com|publisher=Cox Newspapers, Inc.|date=July 21, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723070952/http://www.ajc.com/ap/ap/top-news/womans-six-flags-roller-coaster-death-probed/nYxgk/|archivedate=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Gerstlauer would not discuss any specifics, they released a statement saying their restraint system could not open while the ride was in motion.&lt;ref name="Gerst"/&gt; The investigation was completed on September 10, 2013, and Texas Giant reopened on September 14, 2013.

The '''Ixil Community''' is a name given to three neighbouring towns in the [[Quiché (department)|Quiché department]] in the western highlands of [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name=refugee&gt;{{Cite book|title=Refugees of a hidden war: the aftermath of counterinsurgency in Guatemala |first=Beatriz |last=Manz |publisher=SUNY Press |year=1988 |page=96 |isbn=978-0-88706-676-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These towns are [[Santa Maria Nebaj]], [[San Juan Cotzal]], and [[Chajul|San Gaspar Chajul]].&lt;ref&gt;Manz, Beatriz (1988) p.97&lt;/ref&gt; The area's population is predominantly of [[Ixil people|Ixil]] descent. When viewed on a map, the three Ixil towns appear to form a triangle, because of this, is also named '''Ixil Triangle'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moon Handbooks Guatemala |first=Al |last=Argueta |publisher=Avalon Travel |year=2007 |page=109 |isbn=978-1-59880-057-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Due to its location in the [[Sierra de los Cuchumatanes|Cuchumatanes mountains]],&lt;ref&gt;Argueta, Al (2007) p.150&lt;/ref&gt; the Ixil Community has remained  isolated from the rest of the world. Its people have therefore maintained their traditional culture — free from influences of the outside world. Although the introduction modern western media is rapidly eroding the culture as young men and women look North for economic prosperity and abandonment of the culture and language are present problems .Most men are farmers, and most women are weavers.

Their diet primarily consists of maze based products. Small round tortillas or corn dumplings known as tamalitos are a staple at almost every meal. This love of corn is ingrined in the culture, so much so that many of the Ixil refer to themselves as "men of corn". Stating that the first humans were rolled from masa or ground up maze.

Other foods commonly eaten are boxbol, which are small corn dumplings steamed in squash leaves covered in chili sauce.

Malanga, "guiscil", beans, squash, and eggs make up the rest of their typical diet.

The people of the Ixil Community primarily speak the [[Ixil language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unfinished Conquest: The Guatemalan Tragedy |first=Victor |last=Perera |publisher=University of California Press |year=1995 |page=61 |isbn=978-0-520-20349-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some villagers speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as a secondary language.

==Turmoil During Civil War==
{{main|Guatemalan Civil War}}

[[File:Exhumation in the ixil triangle in Guatemala.jpg|thumb|Ixil people carrying their loved one's remains after an exhumation in the Ixil Triangle in February 2012.]]
During the [[Guatemalan Civil War]], the [[Guerrilla Army of the Poor]] (EGP) used the surrounding mountains as a base of operations.&lt;ref name=adventure&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adventure Guide to Guatemala |first=Shelagh |last=McNally |publisher=Hunter Publishing, Inc |year=2003 |page=213 |isbn=978-1-58843-347-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guatemalan Army pursued a [[scorched-earth]] policy to destroy villages.&lt;ref name=refugee/&gt; The villagers of the Ixil Community were caught in the crossfire, and thousands of civilians were killed, [[torture]]d, or [[Forced disappearance|missing.]]&lt;ref name=adventure/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Argueta, Al (2007) p.151&lt;/ref&gt;

The army's campaign against civilians in this region may have been motivated partially by a desire "to weaken and eventually eradicate Maya culture." Villagers slowly learned not to wear their traditional Maya clothing, because its distinctive appearance made them easy targets for soldiers.

'''Kurapaty''' ({{lang-be|Курапаты}}, {{IPA-be|kuraˈpatɨ|IPA}}) is a wooded area on the outskirts of [[Minsk]], [[Belarus]], in which a vast number of people were executed between 1937 and 1941 during the [[Great Purge]] by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[secret police]], the [[NKVD]].

The exact count of victims is uncertain, as [[NKVD]] archives are classified in Belarus.&lt;ref name="svaboda-daviednik"&gt;[http://www.svaboda.org/content/transcript/1863328.html Памяць і забыцьцё Курапатаў] // [[RFE/RL]], 28.10.2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to various sources the number of people who perished in Kurapaty is estimated in at least 30,000 people (according to attorney general of BSSR Tarnaŭski), up to 100,000 people (according to “Belarus” reference book),&lt;ref name="svaboda-daviednik" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bielarus"&gt;Даведнік «Беларусь». — Мн.: «Беларуская энцыкляпэдыя», 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; from 102,000 to 250,000 people (according to the article by [[Zianon Pazniak]] in “Litaratura i mastactva” newspaper),&lt;ref name="pazniak"&gt;З. Пазьняк, Я. Шмыгалёў, М. Крывальцэвіч, А. Іоў. [http://www.zianonpazniak.de/publications/creation/kurapaty.htm Курапаты]. — Мн.: Тэхналогія, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurapaty // [[Jan Zaprudnik|Zaprudnik, Jan]]. Historical Dictionary of Belarus. — Lamham. — London: Scarecrow Press, 1998. P. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; 250,000 people (according to Polish historian and professor of [[University of Wrocław]] [[Zdzisław Julian Winnicki]]),&lt;ref name="winnicki"&gt;Zdzisław J. Winnicki. ''Szkice kojdanowskie.'' — Wrocław: Wydawnictwo GAJT, 2005. {{ISBN|83-88178-26-1}}. — С. 77—78.&lt;/ref&gt; and more (according to the British historian [[Norman Davies]]).&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;Norman Davies. ''Powstanie '44''. — Kraków: Wydawnictwo Znak, 2004. {{ISBN|83-240-0459-9}}. — С. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Kurapaty were included in the register of the [[Cultural Properties of Belarus]] as a first-category [[cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;Постановлениe Министерства культуры № 15  «О зонах охраны материальной недвижимой историко-культурной ценности «Место уничтожения жертв политических репрессий 30-40-х годов XX века в урочище Куропаты» (2004)/ref

==Discovery and remembrance==
[[File:Kurapaty 1989 meeting.jpg|thumb|200px|Meeting in Kurapaty, 1989]]

The discovery by historian [[Zyanon Paznyak]] and [[exhumation]] of the remains in 1988 gave an added momentum to the pro-[[democracy]] and pro-[[independence]] movement in Belarus in the last years of the Soviet Union before it [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolved]]. There have been investigations by both the Soviet, and Belarusian governments, which have been conclusive as to the perpetrators who are the Soviet NKVD. This is based on former NKVD members confession and the eyewitness testimonies of 55 villagers, from villages such as [[Cna]], Cna-Yodkava, Drazdova, Padbaloccie and others, that gave evidence that NKVD brought people in trucks and executed them during 1937 – 1941.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

[[President of the United States]] [[Bill Clinton]] visited Kurapaty forest in 1994, when he came to Belarus with a "thank you" visit after Belarus agreed to transfer their post-Soviet [[nuclear weapons]] to [[Russia]]. Clinton presented a small granite monument "To Belarusians from the American people", perhaps the first post-Soviet cultural artefact from the U.S. on the Belarusian soil. The monument was damaged three times by unidentified vandals, but subsequently restored.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In 2001, when the Kurapaty site was threatened by a planned widening of the [[MKAD (Minsk)|Minsk Ring Road]], youth from the [[Belarusian Popular Front]], [[Zubr (political organization)|Zubr]] and smaller organizations occupied the site and sat out a bitter winter in tents, trying to halt the road construction, with no success.

On October 29, 2004, the [[Jew]]ish community of Belarus installed a monument in memory of the Jews and other nationals who were murdered in Kurapaty forest. The brown granite stone has two inscriptions in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and in [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: "To our fellow-believers&amp;mdash;Jews, Christians and the Muslims&amp;mdash;the victims of [[Stalinism]] from the Belarusian Jews."

Each year in November, on [[Dziady]] (the All Saints or the day when Belarusians commemorate their deceased forefathers), hundreds of people visit this site of crimes of Soviet [[political repression]]. The first such demonstration in 1988, in which there were tens of thousands of participants, was brutally dispersed by the police. Officials from the Belarussian administration do not recognize the Kurapaty case as a certain Soviet [[crime against humanity]] and never mention Kurapaty in public.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The Modern Irish word for woman is ''bean'' /bæn/ and ''síd(h)'' (or ''sí'' in modern spelling) is an Irish term referring to a 'fairy mound'. (See [[Sidhe]].) However, in traditional Irish mythology a banshee is seen as an omen of death.

;[[boreen]]: (from ''bóithrín'' meaning "small road") a narrow rural road in Ireland.
;[[boycott]]: abstaining from using, buying, or dealing with a person, organization, or country as an expression of protest. (from [[Charles Boycott|Captain Charles Boycott]], a 19th-century British land agent)

The ''craic'' spelling, although preferred by many Irish people, has garnered some criticism as a ''faux''-Irish word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Words We Use |work=[[The Irish Times]] |page=27 |date=1992-12-05 |first=Diarmaid |last=Ó Muirithe }}; reprinted in {{cite book |title=The Words We Use |first=Diarmaid |last=Ó Muirithe |pages=154–5 |date=October 2006 |isbn=978-0-7171-4080-0 |publisher=[[Gill &amp; Macmillan]] |location=[[Dublin]]}}

;[[cross]]: The ultimate source of this word is Latin ''crux'', the Roman [[gibbet]] which became a symbol of Christianity. Some sources say the English wordform comes from Old Irish ''cros''.&lt;ref name=Harper2&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=cross&amp;searchmode=term Online Etymology Dictionary] by Douglas Harper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt; Other sources say the English comes from Old French ''crois''&lt;ref name=Skeat&gt;''An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language'' by Walter W. Skeat (1888) (900 pages). [https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00skeauoft Downloadable at Archive.org].&lt;/ref&gt; and others say it comes from Old Norse ''kross''.&lt;ref name=Weekely1921&gt;''An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English'' by Ernest Weekley (1921) (850 pages).

''Drumlin'' is a linguistic [[diminutive]] of ''drum'', and it means a small rounded hill of glacial formation, often seen in series (OED). A landscape of many Drumlins occurs in some parts of Ireland (including counties Cavan and Armagh). ''Drumlin'' is an established technical word in geology, but ''drum'' is almost never used.
;[[drisheen]]: (from ''drisín'' or ''drúishin'').
;[[dulse]]:&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;''Collins English Dictionary 21st Century Edition'' Harper Collins (2001) {{ISBN|0-00-472529-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from Old Irish ''duilesc'').
;[[esker]]: (from ''eiscir'') an elongated [[mound]] of post-glacial gravel, usually along a [[river valley]] (OED). Esker is a technical word in geology.
;[[Fenian]]: (from ''[[Fianna]]'' meaning "semi-independent warrior band") a member of a 19th-century Irish nationalist group (OED).
;[[Fiacre (carriage)|fiacre]]: a small four-wheeled [[carriage]] for hire, a hackney-coach. [[Saint Fiacre]] was a seventh-century Irish-born saint who lived in France for most of his life. The English word ''fiacre'' comes from French. (OED)
;[[Gallowglass]]: (from ''gallóglach'') a Scottish Gaelic [[mercenary soldier]] in Ireland between mid 13th and late 16th centuries.
;[[wikt:galore|galore]]: (from ''go leor'' meaning "til plenty") a lot (OED).
;gob: (literally ''[[beak]]'') [[mouth]], though used in colloquial Irish more often to refer to a 'beaky' nose, i.e. a sticky-beak. Perhaps from Irish. (OED)
;[[wikt:griskin|griskin]]: (from ''griscín'') a lean cut of meat from the loin of a pig.

;[[wikt:kibosh|kibosh]], [[wikt:kybosh|kybosh]]: to finish, to put an end to: "That's put the kibosh on it". The OED says the origin is obscure and possibly Yiddish.

(Caip bháis - pronounced as kibosh - is also a word in Irish for a candle-snuffer.)
;[[Leprechaun]]: (from ''leipreachán'', based on Old Irish luchorpán, from lu 'small' + corp 'body' (ODE).
;[[Limerick (poetry)|Limerick]]: (from ''Luimneach'')
;[[lough]]: (from ''loch'') a lake, or arm of the sea. According to the OED, the spelling "lough" was originally a separate word with a similar meaning but different pronunciation, perhaps from Old Northumbrian: this word became obsolete, effectively from the 16th century, but in Anglo-Irish its spelling was retained for the word newly borrowed from Irish.
;[[wikt:phoney|phoney]]: (probably from the English ''fawney'' meaning "gilt brass ring used by swindlers", which is from Irish ''fáinne'' meaning "ring") fake.&lt;ref name=PHoney&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Paul S|title=The genuine etymological story of ''phone(e)y''|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|year=2011|volume=109|issue=1|pages=1–11|doi=10.1111/j.1467-968X.2011.01247.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;slew: (from ''sluagh'' meaning "a large number") a great amount (OED). Note: as in ''a slew of new products'', not as in ''slay''.
;slob: (from ''slab'') mud (OED). Note: the English words slobber and slobbery do not come from this; they come from Old English.&lt;ref name=Skeat /&gt;
;[[slogan]]: (from ''sluagh-ghairm'' meaning "a battle-cry used by Gaelic clans") Meaning of a word or phrase used by a specific group is metaphorical and first attested from 1704.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=slogan&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;
;smithereens: small fragments, atoms. In phrases such as 'to explode into smithereens'. This is the word ''smithers'' (of obscure origin) with the Irish diminutive ending. Whether it derives from the modern Irish ''smidrín'' or is the source of this word is unclear (OED).
;tilly: (from ''tuilleadh'' meaning "a supplement") used to refer to an additional article or amount unpaid for by the purchaser, as a gift from the vendor (OED). Perhaps more prevalent in Newfoundland than Ireland. James Joyce, in his ''[[Pomes Penyeach]]'' included a thirteenth poem as a bonus (as the book sold for a shilling, twelve poems would have come to a penny each), which he named "Tilly," for the extra sup of milk given to customers by milkmen in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fargnoli |first1=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25831">[[Image:Subtropical.png|thumb|right|300 px|Areas of the world with subtropical climates]]
This '''list of locations with a subtropical climate''' specifically lists locations considered within the [[subtropics]].  The subtropics are geographic and [[Köppen climate classification|climate zones]] located roughly between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn]] and the  40th parallel in both hemispheres.  Subtropical climate regimes can exist at high elevations within the [[tropics]], such as across the [[Mexican Plateau]] and in [[Vietnam]] and [[Taiwan]].  Six climate classifications utilise the term to help define the various [[temperature]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] regimes for the planet [[Earth]]. Using the [[Trewartha climate classification]] eight or more months of the year within the subtropics have an average temperature at or above {{convert|10|°C|1}}. The [[Köppen climate classification]] instead classifies the warmest month above {{convert|22|C|F}} and the coldest above {{convert|0|C|F}} or {{convert|-3|C|F}} depending on preference.

A great portion of the world's deserts are located within the subtropics, due to the development of the [[subtropical ridge]].  Within the humid monsoon regimes in the subtropics, a [[wet season]] is seen annually during the summer, which is when most of the yearly rainfall falls.  Within the [[Mediterranean climate]] regime, the wet season occurs during the winter.  Areas bordering warm oceans are prone to locally heavy rainfall from [[tropical cyclone]]s, which can contribute a significant percentage of the annual rainfall.  Plants such as [[date palm]]s, [[citrus]], [[mango]], [[litchi]], and [[avocado]] are grown within the subtropical zones.

This is not a complete list. Many of the higher mountains at tropical latitudes have sparsely (if at all) inhabited areas with a subtropical climate. Roads with [[raised pavement marker|reflectors]] also exist in most areas with subtropical climates. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25510">Postal codes ({{lang-da|postnumre}}) in [[Denmark]] are 4-digit codes. They were implemented in 1967, and were based on the territorial divisions of towns and municipalities at the time. The postal codes 1000-1999 are each assigned to individual streets and large mail recipients, such as companies, organizations or public administrations. Not included in this list are postal codes for postal service centres and bulk mail receivers, the latter using the postal codes 0800-0990 (a more elaborate list can be found on the Danish entry [[:da:Danske postnumre|'Danske postnumre']]). [[List of postal codes in Greenland|Greenland]] has postal codes in the same series (3900-3999) while the [[List of postal codes in the Faroe Islands|Faroes]] do not.

Use zip (postnummer) =&gt; returns empty list; or town (Bynavn) =&gt; returns a list of street names with 3500 zip. I believe this must be enough to document my "claim"--&gt;

This is a list of all the '''[[Speaker (politics)|presidents]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of Madeira|Legislative Assembly]] of the [[Madeira|Autonomous Region of Madeira]]''', [[Portugal]], since 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923072745/http://www.alram.pt/presidente/nota-biografica.html|title=Presidentes Anteriores|website=Assembleia Legislativa da Região Autónoma da Madeira|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923072545/http://www.alram.pt/presidente/presidentes-anteriores.html|archive-date=23 September 2017|access-date=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alram.pt/presidente/nota-biografica.html|title=Presidente – Nota Biográfica|website=Assembleia Legislativa da Região Autónoma da Madeira|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923072745/http://www.alram.pt/presidente/nota-biografica.html|archive-date=23 September 2017|access-date=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position was created in 1976 after the newly enacted [[Constitution of Portugal]], which followed the [[Carnation Revolution|1974 Revolution]], granted [[Autonomous administrative division|legislative autonomy]] to [[Azores|the Azores]] and [[Madeira|Madeira archipelagoes]], thus establishing the [[Autonomous Regions of Portugal|Portuguese Autonomous Regions]] and the respective governing bodies. It is analogous to the position of [[Presidents of the Legislative Assembly of the Azores|President of the Legislative Assembly of the Azores]] and both are equally 14th in the [[Portuguese order of precedence]], being this the highest ranking position of any regional governing body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parlamento.pt/Legislacao/Documents/Legislacao_Anotada/LeiPrecedenciasProtocoloEstadoPortugues_Simples.pdf|title=Lei das Precedências do Protocolo do Estado Português|access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the first Madeiran regional elections the same year, which resulted in the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Democratic Peoples' Party]] (now Social Democratic Party) having the [[majority]] of members of parliament, Emanuel Nascimento dos Santos Rodrigues was elected the first President of the Legislative Assembly. The position has since been held by members of the same party, which has never lost its majority. The current President is José Lino Tranquada Gomes, who is a member of the Assembly since 1988.

Two of the presidents were physicians (Nélio and Miguel Mendonça) and the other two were/are lawyers (Rodrigues and Tranquada Gomes) before taking office.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46239">[[File:DN-SD-03-08769.JPEG|thumb|right|The selected stars for navigation are often used for [[sextant observation]]s.]]

Fifty-eight selected navigational [[star]]s are given a special status in the field of [[celestial navigation]]. Of the approximately 6,000&amp;nbsp;stars visible to the [[naked eye]] under optimal conditions, the selected stars are among the brightest and span 38 [[constellation]]s of the [[celestial sphere]] from the [[declination]] of &amp;minus;70° to +89°. Many of the selected stars were named in [[Ancient history|antiquity]] by the [[Babylonia]]ns, Greeks, Romans, and Arabs.

The star [[Polaris]], often called the "North Star", is treated specially due to its proximity to the north [[celestial pole]]. When navigating in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], special techniques can be used with Polaris to determine [[latitude]] or [[gyrocompass]] error. The other 57&amp;nbsp;selected stars have daily positions given in [[nautical almanac]]s, aiding the [[second mate|navigator]] in efficiently performing observations on them. A second group of 115&amp;nbsp;"tabulated stars" can also be used for celestial navigation, but are often less familiar to the navigator and require extra calculations.

For purposes of identification, the positions of navigational stars &amp;mdash; expressed as declination and [[sidereal hour angle]] &amp;mdash; are often rounded to the nearest degree.  In addition to tables, [[star chart]]s provide an aid to the navigator in identifying the navigational stars, showing [[constellation]]s, relative positions, and brightness.

==Background==
[[File:Nautical almanac left-hand page.png|thumb|right|Selected navigation stars (except Polaris) listed on a [[Nautical almanac|U.S. Nautical Almanac]] page for May 1995]]
Under optimal conditions, approximately 6,000&amp;nbsp;stars are visible to the naked eye of an observer on Earth.&lt;ref name="bow249"&gt;Bowditch, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;249.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of these, 58&amp;nbsp;stars are known in the field of navigational astronomy as "selected stars", including 19&amp;nbsp;stars of the first magnitude, 38&amp;nbsp;stars of the second magnitude, and [[Polaris]].&lt;ref name="bow249"/&gt;  The selection of the stars is made by [[Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office]] and the [[US Naval Observatory]], in the production of the yearly ''[[Nautical Almanac]]'' which the two organizations have published jointly since 1958.&lt;ref name="USNO almanac history"&gt;{{cite web |title =History of the Nautical Almanac |publisher=US Naval Observatory |url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/publications/hist-naut-almanac |accessdate =  2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criteria in the choice of stars includes their distribution across the celestial sphere, brightness, and ease of identification.&lt;ref&gt;Wright and Whitney, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;273.&lt;/ref&gt; Information for another 115&amp;nbsp;stars, known as "tabulated stars", is also available to the navigator.&lt;ref name="bow249"/&gt; This list provides information on the name, approximate position in the celestial sphere, and [[apparent magnitude]] of the 58&amp;nbsp;selected stars in tabular form and by star charts.

These stars are typically used in two ways by the navigator. The first is to obtain a [[line of position]] by use of a [[sextant]] observation and the techniques of celestial navigation.&lt;ref name="bow301-303"&gt;Bowditch, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;301&amp;ndash;303.&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiple lines of position can be intersected to obtain a position known as a celestial fix. The second typical use of the navigational stars is to determine gyrocompass error by computing the [[azimuth]] of a star and comparing it to an azimuth measured using the ship's gyrocompass.&lt;ref name="bow271-274"&gt;Bowditch, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;271&amp;ndash;274.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other applications also exist.

Navigators typically refer to stars using one of two naming systems for stars: common names and [[Bayer's Name|Bayer's designations]].&lt;ref name="bow249"/&gt; All of the selected stars have had a common name since 1953, and many were named in antiquity by the Arabs, Greeks, Romans, and Babylonians.&lt;ref name="bow249"/&gt; Bayer's naming convention has been in use since 1603, and consists of a Greek letter combined with the possessive form of the star's constellation.&lt;ref name="bow249"/&gt; Both names are shown for each star in the tables and charts below.

Each star's approximate position on the celestial sphere is given using the [[equatorial coordinate system]]. The celestial sphere is an imaginary globe of infinite size with the Earth at its center.&lt;ref name="bow234"&gt;Bowditch, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;234.&lt;/ref&gt; Positions on the celestial sphere are often expressed using two coordinates: [[declination]] and sidereal hour angle, which are similar to latitude and [[longitude]] on the surface of the Earth. To define declination, the Earth's [[equator]] is projected out to the celestial sphere to construct the [[celestial equator]], and declination is measured in degrees north or south of this celestial equator.&lt;ref name="bow234"/&gt; Sidereal hour angle is a measurement between 0° and 360°, indicating how far west a body is from an arbitrarily chosen point on the celestial sphere called the ''[[March equinox|First Point of Aries]]''.  Note that right ascension, as used by astronomers, is 360° minus the sidereal hour angle.

The final characteristic provided in the tables and star charts is the star's brightness, expressed in terms of apparent magnitude. Magnitude is a logarithmic scale of brightness, designed so that a body of one magnitude is approximately 2.512&amp;nbsp;times brighter than a body of the next magnitude.&lt;ref group="Note" name="mag"&gt;The value is actually the fifth root of 100, an [[irrational number]] known as [[Pogson's Ratio]]. See {{cite book |title=Teaching Science |volume=52–53 |author= |date=2006 |publisher=Australian Science Teachers' Association |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ae0kAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Pogson's+Ratio%22+irrational+number&amp;dq=%22Pogson's+Ratio%22+irrational+number&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fwCFTI-8A8TYnAedib1i&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA
 |accessdate=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bow219"&gt;Bowditch, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;219.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a body of magnitude 1 is 2.512&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, or 100&amp;nbsp;times brighter than a body of magnitude 6.&lt;ref name="bow219"/&gt; The dimmest stars that can be seen through a 200&amp;nbsp;inch terrestrial telescope are of the 20th&amp;nbsp;magnitude, and very bright objects like the Sun and a full Moon have magnitudes of &amp;minus;26.7 and &amp;minus;12.6 respectively.&lt;ref name="bow219"/&gt;{{clear}}

The table of navigational stars provides several types of information.  In the first column is the identifying index number, followed by the common name, the Bayer designation, and the etymology of the common name.  Then the star's approximate position, suitable for identification purposes, is given in terms of declination and sidereal hour angle, followed by the star's magnitude.  The final column presents citations to the sources of the data,  ''The American Practical Navigator'' and the star's entry at the [[SIMBAD]] database, a project of the [[Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg|Strasbourg Astronomical Data Center]] or CDS.

Navigators often use [[star chart]]s to identify a star by its position relative to other stars.  References like the ''Nautical Almanac'' and ''The American Practical Navigator'' provide four star charts, covering different portions of the celestial sphere.  Two of these charts are [[azimuthal equidistant projection]]s of the north and south poles.  The other two cover the equatorial region of the celestial sphere, from the declination of 30° south to 30° north.   The two equatorial charts are [[mercator projection]]s, one for the eastern hemisphere of the celestial sphere and one for the western hemisphere.  Note that unlike familiar maps, east is shown to the left and west is shown to the right.  With this orientation, the navigator can hold the star chart overhead, and the arrangement of the stars on the chart will resemble the stars in the sky.&lt;ref name="bow249"/&gt;
 
In the star charts, constellations are labelled with capital letters and indicated by dotted lines collecting their stars.  The 58 selected stars for navigation are shown in blue and labelled with their common name, star number, and a Greek letter to indicate their Bayer designation.  The additional 115 tabulated stars that can also be used for navigation are shown in red and labelled with a Greek letter to indicate their Bayer designation.  Some additional stars not suitable for navigation are also included on the charts to indicate constellations, they are presented as unlabelled small red dots.

===Equatorial stars===
&lt;!-- The 29 equatorial stars are those with a declination between 30° south and 30° north.  They are listed in order of decreasing sidereal hour angle, or from the [[vernal equinox]] eastward across the sky. --&gt; 
; '''Equatorial stars of the eastern hemisphere'''
The equatorial region of the celestial sphere's eastern hemisphere includes 16 navigational stars from Alpheratz in the constellation Andromeda to Denebola in Leo.  It also includes stars from the constellations Cetus, Aries, Taurus, Orion, Canis Major and Minor, Gemini, and Hydra.  Of particular note among these stars are "the dog star" Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, and four stars of the easily identified constellation Orion.{{clear}} &lt;!-- fix for very-wide screens --&gt;

Marcelino Oreja Elósegui was descendant to a petty [[bourgeoisie]] [[Basque people|Basque]] family, originating from the [[Gipuzkoa]]n town of [[Orexa]].&lt;ref&gt;according to Marcelino Oreja Aguirre, ''Antecedentes de la Revolución de octubre de 1934 y su repercusión en el País Vasco'', [in:] ''Euskonews'' s/d, available [http://www.euskonews.com/0600zbk/gaia60001es.html here]; José María Urkia Etxabe, ''Benigno Oreja, pionero de la Urología en Euskadi'', [in:] ''Noticias de Gipuzkoa'', 15.10.14 claims that the family was from “localidades navarras de Atayo y Arriba” see [http://m.noticiasdegipuzkoa.com/2014/10/15/ocio-y-cultura/benigno-oreja-pionero-de-la-urologia-en-euskadi here]&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandfather was a physician.&lt;ref&gt;Urkia Etxabe 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Basilio Oreja Echaniz]], settled in the [[Biscay (province)|Biscay]] Ibarrangelu and since the late 1870s also practiced as a doctor,&lt;ref&gt;he is first time mentioned in ''Anuario-almanaque del comercio, de la industria, de la magistratura y de la administración'' of 1879, p. 1215, see [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0005044917&amp;page=1215 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 20th century briefly serving also as a mayor.&lt;ref&gt;listed as alcalde in 1900 and 1902, compare ''Annual del comercio, de la industria, de la magistratura y de la administraction'', 2 (1900), p. 545, available  [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0005257317&amp;page=545&amp; here]; in 1899 and 1904 he is listed as "medico", compare [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0005238401&amp;page=483&amp; here]&lt;/ref&gt; Marcelino's mother, Cecilia Elósegui Ayala, came from a distinguished and much branched Gipuzkoan family.&lt;ref&gt;Urkia Etxabe 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His older brothers were active in the [[Names of the Basque Country (in Spanish)|Vascongadas]] branch of Carlism during the late [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration]] period already. Basilio died early.&lt;ref&gt;''La Lectura Dominical'' 20.06.14 available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001674925&amp;page=12 here]&lt;/ref&gt; [[:es:Benigno Oreja Elosegui|Benigno]] made his name as a physician and one of [[urology]] pioneers in Gipuzkoa.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Benigno Oreja'' entry at ''Colegio Oficial de Médicos de Gipuzkoa'' website, available [http://www.gisep.org/es_benigno_oreja.aspx here]; he was also active in the Carlist medical service during the Civil War, see Manuel Solórzano Sánchez, ''Las Margaritas.

Marcelino Oreja was born to his parents rather late,&lt;ref&gt;the exact birth year remains somewhat unclear. José Luis Orella Martínez, ''El origen del primer Catolicismo social Español'', [PhD thesis, Universidad de Educación a Distancia], Madrid 2012, p. 235, claims he was born in 1896; the  [http://www.myheritage.com/research?action=query&amp;exactSearch=0&amp;formId=master&amp;formMode=1&amp;qevents=List&amp;qname=Name+fn.marcelino%2F3oreja+ln.elosegui+g.&amp;trn=partner_Geni_lo&amp;trp=search_bann Geni] service indicates 1894, the same year is mentioned by Roberto Villa García, ''Las elecciones de 1933 en el País Vasco y Navarra'', Madrid 2007, {{ISBN|8498491150}}, 9788498491159, p. 272; ''Marcelino Oreja Elosegui'' entry at ''Auñamendi Eusko Entzikipedia'' available [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/111360 here] claims he was born in 1891&lt;/ref&gt; much junior than his older brothers,&lt;ref&gt;the birth year of his brother Benigno is also unclear. Some claim it was 1878, see Santiago Casas, ''Los Cursos Internacionales Católicos de San Sebastián (1935)'', [in:] ''Sancho el Sabio'', 35 (2012), p. 152; some claim he was born in 1880, see Urkia Etxabe 2014; depending what birth of Marcelino is adopted, the difference between the two could be 11 or 18 years, see also José Antonio Martín Aguado, José R. Vilamor, ''Historia del Ya: sinfonía con final trágico'', Madrid 2012, {{ISBN|8415382502}}, 9788415382508, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; and was brought up in a militantly Catholic ambience.&lt;ref&gt;Aguado, Vilamor 2012, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; He studied civil engineering and graduated as ingeniero de caminos, canales y puertos,&lt;ref&gt;''La formación de la imagen del Colegio.

&lt;/ref&gt; He married Purificación Aguirre Isasi, descendant to a well-to-do Gipuzkoan family. Her father, [[Toribio Aguirre Ibarzabal]], served as a [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] officer during the [[Third Carlist War]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marcelino Oreja habla de su padre'', [in:] ''[[Diario Vasco]]'' 01.11.09, Josemari Velez de Mendizabal, ''Unión Cerrajera S.A.

==Catholic activist==
[[File:Iglesia de Santa Lucía (Estatua).JPG|thumbnail|160px|left|[[Angel Herrera Oria]]]]
Profoundly religious though falling short of exalted religiosity,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. he rejected approaches by a visionary, Francisco Patxi Goicoechea, see William A. Christian, ''Visionaries: The Spanish Republic and the Reign of Christ'', Berkeley 1996, {{ISBN|0520200403}}, 9780520200401,  pp. 60, 453&lt;/ref&gt; Oreja commenced his public activity during the academic period in the very last years of the Restoration era. In early 1920 he entered [[:es:Asociación Católica de Propagandistas|Asociación Católica Nacional de Propagandistas]],&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 289, Pedro Fernández Barbadillo, ''El día en que los socialistas asesinaron a Marcelino Oreja'', [in:] ''Libertad Digital Historia'', 01.06.11, available [http://www.libertaddigital.com/opinion/historia/el-dia-en-que-los-socialistas-asesinaron-a-marcelino-oreja-1276239062.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; the lay Catholics organization founded back in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 289, Fernández Barbadillo 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Seconded by ACNdP, later that year he commenced work on launching a conservative academic union, [[Asociación Nacional de Estudiantes Católicos Españoles]], set up and confederated with [[Confederación Internacional de Estudiantes Católicos]].&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, pp. 231-233&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Madrid]], Oreja emerged as number two in the organization, becoming its secretary general;&lt;ref&gt;''Marcelino Oreja Elosegui'' entry at ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'', also Fernández Barbadillo 2011. The president was Fernando Martín Sánchez-Julia, Orella Martínez 2012, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; he is credited for “inflammatory&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; harangues, opposing [[secularism]] in education and advocating Catholic integrity as an academic foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Some time afterwards, still acting on ACNdP initiative, he went on to build another Christian youth organization, [[Juventud Católica Española]], somewhat broader in scope than CEC and more tied up with the parochial network. In 1924 Oreja entered its first Comisión Ejecutiva and became member of the propaganda section,&lt;ref&gt;Chiaki Watanabe, ''La Juventud Católica Española.Orígenes y primer desarrollo'', [in:] ''Espacio, Tiempo y Forma'', 8 (1995), pp. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; travelling extensively across Spain, organizing JCE structures and taking part in various congresses,&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, pp. 316-317&lt;/ref&gt; described as “vibrant and effusive” speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Cervera, ''Ángel Ayala, S.I.'', Madrid 2009, {{ISBN|978-84-96860-51-3}}, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:News room new york times 02106u.tif|thumbnail|220px|[[New York Times|NYT]] newsroom]]
In 1925 Oreja joined the ACNdP executive, nominated consejero nacional of the organization&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; and rising to one of its key figures, on friendly terms with [[Angel Herrera Oria]]. In the mid-1920s&lt;ref&gt;Aguado, Vilamor 2012,  p. 49 claims it was in 1920&lt;/ref&gt; Herrera dispatched him to the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;Alicia Tapia López, ''La enseñanza de la documentación en la escuela de periodismo de «El Debate». Antecedentes y evolución posterior (1989 [sic!]-1971)'', [in:] ''Documentación de las Ciencias de la Información'' 24 (2001), p. 222, wrongly claims it was Ricardo not Marcelino&lt;/ref&gt; the key purpose having been management training. Oreja enrolled at [[Columbia University]], studying administration and journalism;&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 436, Aguado, Vilamor 2012, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; he was also gaining hands-on familiarity with top American newspapers, collaborating with ''[[Boston Globe]]'' and ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Oreja Aguirre, ''Antecedentes…''&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in the US for two years.&lt;ref&gt;Aguado, Vilamor 2012, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, Oreja praised efficiency of modern American Catholic organizations like [[:es:Caballeros de Colón|Caballeros de Colón]] and warned against the Jewish influence in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Back in Spain, ACNdP seconded him to ''[[El Debate]]'', a dynamic daily owned by a controlled publishing house, [[Editorial Católica]];&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, pp. 66-68&lt;/ref&gt; Oreja entered the executive board and became its manager.&lt;ref&gt;''Marcelino Oreja Elosegui'' entry at ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited for setting up an affiliated journalism school, renovating [[Linotype machine|linotype]] infrastructure, introducing new techniques of editing and innovative advertising strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Aguado, Vilamor 2012, p. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manager==

In the late 1920s Oreja had to leave Madrid due to family reasons and returned to the Vascongadas;&lt;ref&gt;Aguado, Vilamor 2012, p. 49. No information on exact nature of these “family duties” is provided, though this could simply refer to his marriage&lt;/ref&gt; instead of his home Biscay he settled in Gipuzkoa, moving into the family estate of his wife in Mondragón. In 1927 he commenced business activity related to his vocation as an engineer, becoming a manager of [[Vidrieras Españolas]],&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Bilbao]]-based glass and mirror company.&lt;ref&gt;see fundacionvicrile service [http://www.fundacionvicrila.com/archivos/201303/1945-6-29-madrid-abc.pdf?1 here], later Vicasa S.A; in the 1990s the company merged with the French giant Saint Gobain&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 he set up his own enterprise, [[Agromán]],&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Barbadillo 2011, also Juan Ramón Garai Bengoa, ''Celestino Uriarte: Clandestinidad y Resistencia Comunista'', Tafalla 2008, {{ISBN|8481365246}}, 9788481365245, p. 32. The company was favored during the Francoist times, see Juan Miguel Baquero, ''Qué empresas usaron a esclavos del franquismo?'', [in:] ''El Diario'' 26.04.14, available [http://www.eldiario.es/andalucia/empresas-usaron-esclavos-franquismo_0_251975222.html here]; in 1995 it was absorbed by Ferrovial, see [http://www.ferrovial.com/es/Nuestra-compania/Historia?_afrLoop=1650039679376853&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_afrWindowId=null#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D1340784450904483%26wcnav.model%3D%25252Foracle%25252Fwebcenter%25252Fportalapp%25252Fnavigations%25252Fnavegacion_es%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dgo0b0m33k_4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; specializing in construction work and gaining governmental contracts.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. at the Universidad Central refurbishment works, see ''ABC'' 24.07.1930 available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1930/07/24/018.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 he became secretary of Consejo Administracion of [[Obrascón]],&lt;ref&gt;Jaime de la Fuente (ed.), De Obrascón a OHL. Crónica de un centenario, 1911-2011, Bilbao 2011, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; a Bilbao construction agglomerate managed by a Carlist politician [[José Joaquín de Ampuero y del Río]], also favored during the Primo de Rivera dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;Fuente 2011, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1930s Marcelino Oreja succeeded his father-in-law as managing director of Unión Cerrajera,&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Barbadillo 2011, Sharryn Kasmir, ''The Myth of Mondragon: Cooperatives, Politics, and Working Class Life in a Basque Town'', New York 1996, {{ISBN|0791430030}}, 9780791430033 p. 59 says it was in 1933, the same date is given by Barrutiabengoa 2007, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; at that time somewhat of a hybrid between a typical [[joint-stock company]] and a [[cooperative]].&lt;ref&gt;it became a mythical model of a Basque cooperative, allegedly defying the social class conflict within a framework of an integrated Basque industrial community, see Kasmir 1996, esp. the chapter ''Making the Myth of Mondragon'', pp. 15-40&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors claim that during his term Oreja transformed Union into one of the greatest Biscay businesses,&lt;ref&gt;Jose Maria Codon, ''La tradicion en Jose Antonio y el sindicalismo en Mella'', Madrid 1962, chapter 6: ''Marcelino Oreja Elosegui o la accion social'', pp. 24. The company is referred to as “todopoderosa”, see ''Marcelino Oreja habla…''&lt;/ref&gt; the others acknowledge its dynamics with some 1,500 employees, but do not credit Oreja for its growth.&lt;ref&gt;Velez de Mendizabal, Barrutiabengoa, Garai 2007; the authors at one point straightforwardly dub him “Marcelino the swine”, see p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Union Cerrajera sarrera Arrasate.jpg|thumbnail|220px|Union Cerrajera main building]]
Oreja represented a new breed of managers, attempting to defuse social conflict with a social-Catholic mixture of papal teachings of [[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]] and traditionalist [[corporativism]] of [[Juan Vázquez de Mella]]. To promote this vision he co-founded [[Agrupación Vasca de Acción Social Cristiana]] in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;and became member of its first Junta Directiva, presided by Jose Antonio Aguirre, see Iñaki Mirena Anasagasti Olabeaga, ''Acción social Cristiana para salvar la sociedad'', [in:] ''ianasgasti.blogs'' available [http://ianasagasti.blogs.com/mi_blog/2013/02/acci%C3%B3n-social-cristiana-para-salvar-la-sociedad.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; though he was able to test its feasibility at Union Cerrajera. As a manager he remained attentive to questions of workplace safety, social insurance and education;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. attempting to open a vocational school in Mondragon, see ''La Escuela de Aprendices'', [in:] Josemari Velez de Mendizabal Azkarraga, ''Unión Cerrajera S.A, un patrimonio de cien años'', available [http://www.euskonews.com/0356zbk/gaia35601es.html here]. Entirely different opinion is expressed by the very same author at Velez de Mendizabal 2007, p. 77, where he claims that Oreja opposed vocational schools&lt;/ref&gt; in 1933 he drafted the statute of [[Hermandad de Trabajadores de Unión Cerrajera]], a Catholic [[trade union]] eventually set up after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 235; Velez de Mendizabal 2007, p. 64 when discussing the emergence of HETRUC mentions neither Oreja nor the Catholic character of the union&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was vehemently hostile to competitive visions of labor relations, denouncing both [[Fascism]]&lt;ref&gt;Martin Blinkhorn, ''Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939'', Cambridge 1975, {{ISBN|9780521207294}}, p. 167 claims Oreja opposed Fascism due to its exaltation of an omnipotent state. Some highly partisan authors claim exactly the opposite and link Oreja with fascism, see Erlantz Cantabrana Berrio, ''Breve memoria - historia (subjectiva) del siglo XX y XXI'', s.l. 2010, entry ''1934. Fascismo. Marcelino Oreja Elosegui''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 167. The issue is not entirely clear. Marcelina Oreja is also alleged to have launched a co-operative project in Ermue, which demonstrated conciliatory approach towards the socialists and the communists, see Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''Carlos Hugo frente a Juan Carlos. La solución federal para España que Franco rechazó'', Pamplona 2014, {{ISBN|8477682658}}, 9788477682653, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Having developed a reputation for being authoritarian,&lt;ref&gt;Kasmir 1996, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; he was considered prime enemy by the local [[Unión General de Trabajadores|UGT]] branch,&lt;ref&gt;and dubbed him “swine”, see Josemari Velez de Mendizabal Azkarraga, ''75 años de la revolución de octubre'' [in:] ''Euskonews'' service, available [http://www.euskonews.com/0502zbk/gaia50202es.html here], also ''El último revolucionario'', [in:] ''[[Diario Vasco]]'' 30.04.06, available [http://www.diariovasco.com/pg060430/prensa/noticias/AltoDeba/200604/30/DVA-ALD-000.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; especially that Oreja pledged never to employ a [[PSOE|socialist]] or an [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist]],&lt;ref&gt;“antes de que cualquier republicano pise el suelo de mi fábrica tendrá que comer hierba”, quoted after Garai Bengoa 2008, p. 17; in other references “republicano” is substituted with “socialista”, “sindicalista” etc., see  e.g. ''[[Diario Vasco]]'' [http://www.diariovasco.com/prensa/20061005/altodeba/exposicion-reivindica-revolucion-octubre_20061005.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; a statement which might be indicative of both his corporativist and Basque leanings.&lt;ref&gt;compare Kasmir 1996, especially the chapter ''Socialism versus Basque Nationalism', pp. 56-59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politician==
[[File:Marcelino Oreja Elosegui.png|thumbnail|180px|left|Marcelino Oreja]]
Following in footsteps of his older brothers, as a teenager Oreja was active in local Carlist structures; together with Ricardo and Benigno he defected to the secessionist [[Mellismo|Mellist]] branch of Traditionalism in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;it is not clear what political party he joined. The original mellist party was [[:es:Partido Católico Tradicionalista|Partido Católico Tradicionalista]], and Oreja is reported as representing it as late as 1931, see [http://www.cozar.info/cozpol1931.htm here] and [http://www.historiaelectoral.com/e1931.html here]. According to other sources it was [[:es:Partido Social Popular|Partido Social Popular]], see Orella Martínez 2012, pp. 235&lt;/ref&gt; After the Primo de Rivera coup he engaged in collaboration with the regime, though its nature remains unspecified.&lt;ref&gt;Orella Martínez 2012, p. 235. His brother Ricardo was civil governor of Santander province&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[dictablanda]] period he came out with his first major proposal, presented to the orphaned primoderiveristas: instead of building a successor to [[Spanish Patriotic Union|Union Patriotica]], named [[:es:Unión Monárquica Nacional|Union Monarquica Nacional]],&lt;ref&gt;some sources claim the opposite, namely that he co-founded UMN, see Javier Real Cuesta, ''Los partidos monárquicos en Vizcaya durante la Segunda República'', [in:] ''Estudios de Deusto: revista de la Universidad de Deusto'', 57 (2009), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; he suggested to build a social-Catholic confederation of regionalist movements across Spain.&lt;ref&gt;the confederation was supposed to be headed by Rafael Benjumea y Burín, conde de Guadalhorce. The organization was expected to lure the primoderiveristas towards traditionalism and regionalism and to counter La Lliga , see Gonzalo Alvarez Chillida, ''José María Pemán: pensamiento y trayectoria de un monárquico (1897-1941)'', Cadiz 1996, {{ISBN|8477863059}}, 9788477863052, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; These plans were cancelled by fall of the monarchy and proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic|republic]]. In the early 1930s Oreja already emerged as one of the Basque Right leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Iñaki Egaña, 'Los crímenes de Franco en Euskal herria 1936-1940'', Tafalla 2009, {{ISBN|9788481365597}}, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first republican [[Spanish general election, 1931|electoral campaign of 1931]] Oreja, still representing the mellistas,&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.historiaelectoral.com/e1931.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; forged an alliance with [[Partido Nacionalista Vasco|PNV]] and mainstream Carlism. It eventually materialized in Vascongadas and [[Navarre]] as [[:es:Minoría Vasco-Navarra|lista catolico-fuerista]], with Oreja [[Electoral Carlism (Second Republic)|elected as its deputy]] from the rural Biscay district.&lt;ref&gt;he gained 15 982 votes , see ''Indice Historico de los Diputados'' available  [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Iniciativas?_piref73_2148295_73_1335437_1335437.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-1&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2882400%29.NDIP. here]. In his native Ibarranguelua he won 120 votes, only 2 more than a PNV candidate Francisco Basterrechea, see detailed results by municipality  [http://www.euskadi.net/emaitzak/republica/result_1931/result_mun_prov_vizcaya_1931_c.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; During his first term as a deputy&lt;ref&gt;he did not perform any official role in the Cortes, ''ABC'' 19.03.32 available  [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1932/03/19/021.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; he dedicated himself to the Basque-Navarrese&lt;ref&gt;though a Vizcaino living in Gipuzkoa, Oreja sympathized with the neighboring Navarre and supported the traditional Navarrese identity, see Javier Ugarte Tellería, ''Un episodio de “estilización” de la política antirrepublicana: la fiesta de San Francisco Javier de 1931 en Pamplona'', [in:]L. Castells (ed.), ''El rumor de lo cotidiano, Estudios sobre el País Vasco contemporáneo'', Bilbao 1999, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; autonomy, approached not as a tactical necessity, but as a matter of principle.&lt;ref&gt;exactly unlike most Traditionalists, see Blinkhorn 1975, p. 47. Oreja remained on friendly terms with the PNV leader, José Antonio Aguirre, and raised many eyebrows within Carlism when named Aguirre a „providencial figure”, José Antonio Vaca de Osma, ''Los vascos en la historia de España'', Madrid 1995, {{ISBN|9788432130953}}, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed to the so-called [[:es:Estatuto Vasco-Navarro|Estella Statute]]&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 82; detailed though highly partisan account in José María Jimeno Jurío, ''Navarra jamás dijo no al Estatuto Vasco'', Tafalla 1997, {{ISBN|848136021X}}, 9788481360219&lt;/ref&gt; and kept supporting autonomous regulations even when the government-imposed draft moved religious issues from regional to central portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;''Marcelino Oreja Elosegui'' entry at ''Auñamendi'', also Manuel Ferrer Muñoz, ''La Cuestión estatutaria en Navarra durante la Segunda República', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 52 (1991), p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Another thread of his parliamentary activity – often merged with the Basque cause - was opposing secularization motions of the Left and backing the Church,&lt;ref&gt;compare his speech as follows: "si expulsáis a la Compañía de Jesús de España porque no la consideráis española, nosotros podremos decir que siempre la consideramos vasca, porque vasco es su fundador, y su organización está ínfimamente unida con el alma vasca. Os hablo con el corazón lacerado… Os aseguro que cuando aprobéis este artículo habréis declarado la lucha civil espiritual en aquellas provincias", quoted after [http://eduguridi.webcindario.com/Los%20arrecifes%20baskos5.htm this site]&lt;/ref&gt; especially trying to preserve its education infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Oreja Aguirre, ''Antecedentes…''&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|Carlist standard]]
Supporting reunification of Carlism&lt;ref&gt;he was active in reunification meetings as early as January 1932, taking part in huge Carlist meetings in Biscay, see Antonio Manuel Moral Roncal, ''María Rosa Urraca Pastor: de la militancia en Acción Católica a la palestra política carlista (1900-1936)'', [in:] ''Historia y politica'' 26 (2011), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; in 1932 Oreja joined its united organization, [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]], though he remained relatively lukewarm to dynastical issues and supported broad monarchical alliances on national&lt;ref&gt;see Real Cuesta, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; or regional basis.&lt;ref&gt;like Centro Electoral Autonomo in Bilbao in local elections, see ''ABC'' 07.02.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1933/02/07/032.html here]; Real Cuesta p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; He was heading the Biscay section of [[Requetés|Requeté]], a rapidly growing Carlist paramilitary militia.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 17.11.34&lt;/ref&gt; He successfully represented the party during the [[Spanish general election, 1933|1933 electoral campaign]] to the Cortes,&lt;ref&gt;detailed electoral analysis, including Oreja’s performance, in Villa García 2007. He lost in Ibarranguelua to both PNV candidates. See also [http://www.euskadi.net/emaitzak/republica/result_1933_elecciones/result_mun_prov_vizcaya_1933_c.htm here] and ''Indice Historico'' available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Iniciativas?_piref73_2148295_73_1335437_1335437.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-1&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2882400%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; again standing in the Biscay province and again in alliance with PNV.&lt;ref&gt;unlike in 1931, the alliance with PNV was strictly provincial, Villa García 2007, pp. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt; As late as November 1933 he still advocated the apparently doomed autonomy “contra viento y marea”,&lt;ref&gt;“against all odds”, ''ABC'' 11.11.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1933/11/11/032.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; which, however, did not amount to endorsing Basque nationalism or Basque separatism.&lt;ref&gt;growing in the Basque milieu, Oreja was an ethnic Basque, though his father Basilio – a Basque himself - allegedly banned his sons to speak Basque at home, see [http://gananzia.com/jaime-mayor-oreja-mondragon here]. Marcelino Oreja considered himself Basque in a traditionalist sense, e.g. member of the Spanish political nation&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars oppose him to “integristas” in the autonomy discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Real Cuesta, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[:es:Revolución de Asturias de 1934|revolution of 1934]], the tension in Mondragon was running high.&lt;ref&gt;a popular and dramatized account [http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2014/10/04/paisvasco/1412445405_795176.html here]; the most controversial account in Garai Bengoa 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Oreja was arrested in his home by socialist militiamen, reportedly employees of the company he managed. Following a brief detention, he was shot dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Marcelino Oreja habla…''; details in Garai Bengoa 2008, pp. 42-50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Oreja was the best known single victim of the 1934 revolution in Spain, as no other parliamentary deputy was killed during the turmoil.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''Spain's First Democracy: The Second Republic, 1931-1936'', Madison 1993, {{ISBN|0299136744}}, 9780299136741, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; His death has long reverberated in the national public debate. The Right presented it as a proof of barbarian and Bolshevik nature of the Left, a prefiguration of the future bloody terror, to be imposed by the mass workers’ movements.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''El Siglo Futuro'' 06.10.1934 available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000531079&amp;page=6 here]&lt;/ref&gt; For the Carlists, Oreja became another of their martyrs; the following year he was already honored during Fiesta de los Mártires de la Tradición, the feast dedicated to the fallen Carlists and observed every March from 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; In the Francoist Spain many streets have been named after him. Today “calle Marcelino Oreja” exists, among other places, in Bilbao and [[Mislata]].
[[File:Esq vte blasco ib con marce oreja.jpg|thumbnail|''calle Marcelino Oreja'', Mislata]]
The public memory of Marcelino Oreja Elósegui has been kept alive mostly thanks to his son, Marcelino Oreja Aguirre, who remained a well-known figure in Spain until the late 20th century. Today the Basques usually appreciate Oreja's work on the Basque autonomy, though they tend to ignore his Carlist political identity;&lt;ref&gt;''Marcelino Oreja Elosegui'' entry at ''Auñamendi Eusko Entzikipedia''&lt;/ref&gt; the Leftist-minded Basques view the Basque and the socialist cases as tantamount and consider Oreja the enemy of both.&lt;ref&gt;Oreja is named "personaje antivasco” by a Herri Batasuna activist, see Jon Idigoras, ''El hijo de Juanita Gerrikabeitia'', Tafalla 2000, {{ISBN|8481361496}}, 9788481361490, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; In the Carlist historical discourse he does not figure prominently.&lt;ref&gt;compare a sixtinos fraction of Carlism service [http://www.carlismo.es/?s=oreja here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the partisan debates of current-day Spanish politics he is sometimes acknowledged in relation to [[Jaime Mayor Oreja]], depending on political preferences mentioned either with hostility.&lt;ref&gt;see ''press.o.s.'' site [http://amnistiapresos.blogspot.com/2011/10/pablo-hasel-el-compromiso-de-la.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Merir''' or '''Melieli''' is a small outlying [[island]] of the [[Palau]] group, in the western Pacific Ocean. The island measures 0.90&amp;nbsp;km² and is uninhabited. There is an abandoned village in the north-west of the island which previously hosted a radio station.

The island itself is covered with trees but it is surrounded by a beach around which is a lagoon. Outside this, the whole is surrounded by a coral reef and the open ocean.

Together with the islands of [[Sonsorol]] and Fanna, which are 110&amp;nbsp;km to the north-west, and the island of Pulo Anna 50&amp;nbsp;km away, Merir forms the state of Sonsorol in the republic of Palau.

The first recorded sighting of Merir by the Europeans was by the Spanish missionary expedition commanded by [[Sargento Mayor]] [[Francisco Padilla]] on board of the [[patache]] ''Santísima Trinidad'' in November 1710.&lt;ref&gt;Rienzi, M.L. ''Historia de la Oceanía, o quinta parte del mundo'', Barcelona, 1845-1846, vol.2, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On January 28, 1915, [[President of Chile]] [[Ramón Barros Luco]] promulgated law 2,977,&lt;ref name="law_2977"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=23639&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=1915-02-01 |title=law 2,977 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which arranged all the information insofar about holidays celebrated in Chile. It established or kept the following holidays:

#Sundays year-round.
#January 1 ([[Feast of the Circumcision of Christ]] at the time; [[New Year]] in the late 20th and 21st centuries), June 29 ([[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Saint Peter and Saint Paul]]), August 15 ([[Assumption of Mary]]), December 8 ([[Immaculate Conception]]), December 25 ([[Christmas Day]]), and the floating holidays of the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ]] and [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]].
#Fridays and Saturdays during [[Holy Week]].
#September 18, Establishment of the [[Government Junta of Chile (1810)|First Government Junta]] in 1810.
#September 19 and May 21, in celebration of the glories of the Army and the Navy.
#The day of election of electors of the President of the Republic.

The same law abolished, by omission, four religious holidays: [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] ("Adoración de los Santos Reyes", January 6), [[Carnival]] ("Carnaval", mobile), [[Annunciation]] ("Anunciación del Señor", march 25) and [[Nativity of the Theotokos|Nativity of the Virgin Mary]] ("Natividad de la Virgen", September 8). It also shortened the [[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|national independence holiday]] to two days (until 1914, they occupied September 18, 19 and 20).

On November 14, 1921, President [[Arturo Alessandri Palma]] promulgated Law 3,810,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=24262&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=1921-11-24 |title=law 3,810 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; marking October 12 ([[Columbus Day]]) as holiday.

On April 30, 1931, President [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]] promulgated the "Decree Enforceable as Law" ("Decreto con Fuerza de Ley") 130, marking May 1 ([[May Day]]) as holiday.

In 1932, Provisional President [[Bartolomé Blanche]] reinstated the September 20 holiday,&lt;ref&gt;Decree-law 636, published in the 17/09/1932 edition of the Diario Oficial.&lt;/ref&gt; which existed until 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Law 8,223, published in the 13 September 1945 edition of the Diario Oficial.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the holidays of [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Saint Peter and Saint Paul]], [[Ascension of Jesus Christ]] and [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] were eliminated by Article 144 of Law 16,840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=28681&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=1979-12-29 |title=Law 16,840 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church agreed to celebrate them on the nearest Sunday.

September 11 (the day of the [[Chilean coup of 1973|military coup in 1973]]) was established as a holiday (''Día de la Liberación Nacional'', "Day of National Liberation") by the military regime in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=29453&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=2002-03-06 |title=Law 18,026 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 it was replaced by the ''Día de la Unidad Nacional'' ("Day of National Unity"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=127036&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=2002-03-06 |title=Law 19,588 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be observed the first Monday in September. In March 2002 the latter was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=195243&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=2002-03-06 |title=Law 19,793 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The holiday on June 29 ([[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Saint Peter and Saint Paul]]) was reestablished in September 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=29840&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=1985-09-17 |title=Law 18,432 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, during a visit by [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] was reestablished&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=29998&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=1987-04-14 |title=Law 18,607 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although the Church continued to observe the holiday on the nearest Sunday&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus.cl/iglesia/paso_iglesia/documentos/conf/documentos_sini.ficha.php?mod=documentos_sini&amp;id=370&amp;sw_volver=yes&amp;descripcion= |title=Declaración sobre feriado de Corpus Christi (01/06/1987) |publisher=Jesus.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

On March 10, 2000, Law 19,668&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=160270&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=2007-01-06 |title=Law 19,668 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; moved the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Saint Peter and Saint Paul]], [[Columbus Day]] and [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] holidays to the preceding Monday, if they were to fall on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, or to the following Monday, if they were to fall on a Friday. Additionally, the designation of [[Columbus Day]] was changed from ''Aniversario del Descubrimiento de América'' to ''Día del Descubrimiento de Dos Mundos'' ("Discovery of Two Worlds' Day"), an obvious corruption from the then-recent ubiquitous "Encuentro de dos mundos" ("The Meeting of Two Worlds") slogan.

On January 6, 2007, Law 20,148&lt;ref name="law_20148"/&gt; replaced [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] with [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]], to be observed July 16, starting that year.

On September 14, 2007, Law 20,215.&lt;ref name="law_20215"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=264651&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=2007-09-14 |title=Law 20,215 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; declared holidays all September 17s falling on a Monday and all September 20s falling on a Friday.

On October 11, 2008, Law 20,299&lt;ref name="law_20299"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=279294&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=2008-10-11 |title=Law 20,299 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; established [[Reformation Day]] on October 31 as a national holiday, starting that year. This holiday is moved to the preceding Friday if it falls on a Tuesday, or to the following Friday if it falls on a Wednesday.

On April 30, 2013, Law 20,663 established the regional [[Battle of Arica]] holiday, to be observed only in the [[Arica and Parinacota]] region.&lt;ref name="law_20663"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1050508&amp;idVersion=2013-04-30 |title=law 20,663 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 30, 2016, Law 20,983&lt;ref name="law_20983"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1098384&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=2016-12-30 |title=Law 20,983 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=December 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; declared as holidays those days that are Monday January 2 or Friday September 17.

Besides yearly holidays, since 1901 presidential elections are declared holidays, as mandated by successive versions of the General Elections law (Law 18,700&lt;ref name="law 18,700"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=30082&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=2008-10-04 |title=Law 18,700 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; being the current one; see laws 1,464,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=22671&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=1901-06-22 |title=Law 1,464 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,752,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=22892&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=1905-09-02 |title=Law 1,752 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2,977,&lt;ref name="law_2977"/&gt; decree-law 542,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=6173&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=1925-09-23 |title=decree-law 542 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6,250,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=25329&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=1938-09-14 |title=Law 6,250 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6,834, 9,334 and 12,891). Since the late 20th century, parliamentary and municipal elections are also public holidays (see Law 18,700&lt;ref name="law 18,700"/&gt;). Censuses, held every ten years, are also declared holidays since 1982; that year's census and 1992's were so due to ad-hoc laws;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=29540&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=1982-04-16 |title=Law 18,116 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=30483&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=1992-01-29 |title=Law 19,116 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; censuses taken from 1992 onwards are declared holidays due to a reform in the Census law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=194251&amp;idParte=&amp;idVersion=2002-02-01 |title=Law 19,790 |publisher=Leychile.cl |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This did not occur in 2012, where the census was carried out in the space of two months, using a different methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ilovechile.cl/2011/11/03/instituto-national-de-estadisticas-realeses-questions-censo-2012/37707 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104034445/http://ilovechile.cl/2011/11/03/instituto-national-de-estadisticas-realeses-questions-censo-2012/37707 |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Meaning of the January 1 holiday===

Shortly after Chile's independence, an 1824 (government-approved) Church decree&lt;ref&gt;Boletín de Leyes y Decretos del Gobierno, 1839, tomo II, decreto de 9 de agosto de 1824, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peralta, Paulina (2007).

{{distinguish|text=the {{lang|de|[[Gau (German)|Gau]]}}, an administrative region of the [[NSDAP]] (Nazi Party)}}
[[Image:NS_administrative_Gliederung_1944.png|thumb|300px|NSDAP administrative units, 1944.]]
[[Image:Germany1941.png|thumb|300px|Map of Nazi Germany with {{lang|de|Reichsgaue}} highlighted.]]
A '''{{lang|de|Reichsgau}}''' (plural {{lang|de|Reichsgaue}}) was an administrative subdivision created in a number of [[areas annexed by Nazi Germany|areas annexed]] to [[Nazi Germany]] between 1938 and 1945.

==Overview==
The term was formed from the words {{lang|de|[[Reich]]}} (realm, empire) and {{lang|de|[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]]}}, the latter a deliberately medieval-sounding word with a meaning approximately equivalent to ''[[shire]]''. The {{lang|de|Reichsgaue}} were an attempt to resolve the administrative chaos resulting from the mutually overlapping jurisdictions and different boundaries of the [[NSDAP]] Party {{lang|de|[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gaue]]}}, placed under a Party {{lang|de|[[Gauleiter]]}}, and the [[list of historic states of Germany#States of the Weimar Republic|federal states]], under a {{lang|de|[[Reichsstatthalter]]}} responsible to the [[Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Ministry of the Interior]] (in the [[Provinces of Prussia|Prussian provinces]], the equivalent post was that of {{lang|de|[[Oberpräsident]]}}). Interior Minister [[Wilhelm Frick]] had long desired to streamline the German administration, and the {{lang|de|Reichsgaue}} were the result: the borders of party {{lang|de|Gaue}} and those of the federal states were to be identical, and the party {{lang|de|Gauleiter}} also occupied the post of {{lang|de|Reichsstatthalter}}. Rival interests and the influence the {{lang|de|Gauleiter}} wielded with Hitler prevented any reform from being undertaken in the "[[Altreich (pre-1938 Nazi Germany)|Old Reich]]" ({{lang-de|Altreich}}) which meant Germany in its borders of 1937, before the annexation of other territories like Austria, the {{lang|de|[[Sudetenland]]|italic=no}}, and Bohemia, and the {{lang|de|Reichsgau}} scheme was therefore implemented only in newly-acquired territories. 

There were several {{lang|de|Reichsgaue}}:
* {{lang|de|[[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]}}, formed from the formerly independent [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]]
* {{lang|de|[[Sudetenland]]}}, formed from a substantial part of the German-speaking outer rim areas of the former [[Czechoslovakia]] occupied in 1938
* {{lang|de|[[Danzig-Westpreußen]]}} and {{lang|de|[[Wartheland]]}}, formed from the [[Free City of Danzig]] and areas annexed from [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]

The Ostmark was subsequently subdivided into seven smaller {{lang|de|Reichsgaue}}, generally coterminous with the former Austrian {{lang|de|Länder}} (federal provinces).

Sakhalin, which is about one third the size of [[Honshu]], is just off the east coast of Russia, and just north of Japan. The island's population was 497,973 as of the 2010 census, made up of mostly ethnic [[Russians]] and a smaller [[Koreans|Korean]] community. The [[indigenous peoples]] of the island are the [[Ainu in Russia|Ainu]], [[Orok people|Oroks]] and [[Nivkh people|Nivkhs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museum.sakh.com/eng/10.shtml |title=The Sakhalin Regional Museum: The Indigenous Peoples |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Sakh.com |accessdate=June 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317085144/http://museum.sakh.com/eng/10.shtml |archivedate=March 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakhalin was claimed by both Russia and Japan over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. These disputes sometimes involved military conflict and divisions of the island between the two powers. In 1875, Japan ceded its claims to Russia in exchange for the northern [[Kuril Islands]]. In 1905, following the [[Russo-Japanese War]], the island was divided, with the south going to Japan. Russia has held all of the island since seizing the Japanese portion—as well as all the Kuril Islands—in the final days of [[World War II]] in 1945. Japan no longer claims any of Sakhalin, although it does still [[Kuril Islands dispute|claim the southern Kuril Islands]]. Most Ainu on Sakhalin moved to [[Hokkaido]], only {{convert|43|km|0}} to the south, when the Japanese were displaced from the island in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shaman's Coat: A Native History of Siberia |last= Reid |first= Anna |year= 2003 |publisher=Walker &amp; Company |location=New York |isbn= 0-8027-1399-8 |pages=148–150 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Contains Manchu text}}
The island is known in Russian as Sakhalin (Сахалин). In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], it is known as Kuye ({{zh|s=库页|t=庫頁|p=Kùyè}}). In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], it is known as {{nihongo|Karafuto|樺太}} or, borrowing the Russian appellation, as {{nihongo|''Saharin''|サハリン}}. The spelling Saghalien may be found in historical texts. Choka (or Tchoka) is another name found in the early literature and seems to have been the name used by the islanders themselves, but it is not clear whether these were the [[Nivkh people|Gilyak]] or the [[Ainu people|Ainu]].{{fact|date=August 2018}}

The European names derive from misinterpretation of a [[Manchu language|Manchu]] name {{MongolUnicode|ᠰᠠᡥᠠᠯᡳᠶᠠᠨ&lt;br/&gt;ᡠᠯᠠ ᠠᠩᡤᠠ&lt;br/&gt;ᡥᠠᡩᠠ}} ''sahaliyan ula angga hada'' ("peak/craggy rock at the mouth of the Amur River"). ''Sahaliyan'', the word that has been borrowed in the form of "Sakhalin", means "black" in Manchu, ''ula'' means "river" and ''sahaliyan ula'' ({{MongolUnicode|ᠰᠠᡥᠠᠯᡳᠶᠠᠨ&lt;br/&gt;ᡠᠯᠠ}} , "Black River") is the proper Manchu name of the [[Amur River]]. Its Japanese name, {{nihongo|''[[Karafuto Prefecture|Karafuto]]''|樺太}}, supposedly comes from [[Ainu language|Ainu]] ''[[kamuy]] kar put ya mosir'' ({{lang|ain|カム&lt;small&gt;イ&lt;/small&gt;・カ&lt;small&gt;ラ&lt;/small&gt;・プ&lt;small&gt;ト&lt;/small&gt;・ヤ・モシ&lt;small&gt;リ&lt;/small&gt;}}, shortened to ''Karput'' {{lang|ain|カ&lt;small&gt;ラ&lt;/small&gt;・プ&lt;small&gt;ト&lt;/small&gt;}}), which means "the island a god has created at the estuary (of the Amur River)".{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The name was used by the Japanese during their possession of its southern part (1905–1945).

[[File:CEM-36-NE-corner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maarten Gerritsz Vries|De Vries]] (1643) maps Sakhalin's eastern promontories, but is not aware that he is visiting an island (map from 1682).]]
Sakhalin was inhabited in the [[Neolithic]] Stone Age. Flint implements such as those found in [[Siberia]] have been found at Dui and [[Kusunai]] in great numbers, as well as polished stone hatchets similar to European examples, primitive pottery with decorations like those of the [[Olonets]], and stone weights used with fishing nets. A later population familiar with bronze left traces in earthen walls and kitchen-[[midden]]s on [[Aniva Bay]].

Among the [[indigenous people]] of Sakhalin are the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] in the southern half, the Oroks in the central region, and the Nivkhs in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Worldmark Encyclopedia of Cultures and Daily Life |last=Gall |first=Timothy L. |year= 1998 |publisher=Gale Research Inc |location=Detroit, Michigan |isbn=0-7876-0552-2 |pages=2–3 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese chronicled the [[Xianbei]] and [[Hezhe]] tribes,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} which had a way of life based on fishing.

The [[Mongol Empire]] made some efforts to subjugate the native people of Sakhalin starting in about 1264 CE. According to [[History of Yuan|Yuan]]shi, the official history of the [[Yuan dynasty]], the [[Mongols]] militarily subdued the ''Guwei'' (骨嵬, ''Gǔwéi''), and by 1308, all inhabitants of Sakhalin had submitted to the Yuan.&lt;ref name="conquest"/&gt; The Nivkhs and the Oroks were subjugated earlier, whereas the [[Ainu people]] submitted to the Mongols later.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Following their subjugation, ''Gǔwéi'' elders made tributary visits to Yuan posts located at Wuleihe, Nanghar, and Boluohe until the end of the Mongol Yuan dynasty in China (1368). In the early [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), the tributary relationship was re-established. By the middle of the 15th century, following the introduction of Chinese political and commercial institutions in the Amur region, the [[Ainu in Russia|Sakhalin Ainu]] were making frequent tributary visits to Chinese-controlled outposts.&lt;ref name="conquest"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Conquest of Ainu Lands: Ecology and Culture in Japanese Expansion, 1590–1800 |last=Walker |first=Brett L. |year=2006 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, Calif. |isbn=0-520-24834-1 |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D5iOcHB3h5AC&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;pg=PA133 |accessdate=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese of the Ming dynasty knew the island as Kuyi (苦夷 ''Kǔyí'') or Kuwu ({{zh|c=苦兀|p=Kǔwù}}), and later as Kuye ({{zh|c=庫頁|p=Kùyè}}), as it is known today. There is some evidence that the Ming eunuch Admiral [[Yishiha]] reached Sakhalin in 1413 during one of his expeditions to the lower Amur, and granted Ming titles to a local chieftain.&lt;ref name=tsai&gt;{{cite book |title=Perpetual Happiness: The Ming Emperor Yongle |last=Tsai |first=Shih-Shan Henry |year= 2002 |origyear=2001 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle, Wash |isbn= 0-295-98124-5 |pages=158–161 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aU5hBMxNgWQC&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;pg=PA159 |accessdate=June 16, 2010}} Link is to partial text.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Ming dynasty, commerce in Northeast Asia and Sakhalin was placed under the "system for subjugated peoples", or ''ximin tizhi''. This suggests that the island was at least nominally under the administration of the [[Nurgan Regional Military Commission]], which was established by Yishiha near today's village of [[Tyr, Russia|Tyr]] on the Siberian mainland in 1411, and continued operating until the mid-1430s.&lt;ref name=tsai/&gt; A [[Yongning Temple Stele|Ming boundary stone]] still exists on the island.

=== European and Japanese exploration ===
[[File:Kitchen-21-Russia-Sahalin-2820.jpg|thumb|left|Display of Sakhalin on maps varied throughout the 18th century. This map from a 1773 atlas, based on the [[:commons:File:CEM-44-La-Chine-la-Tartarie-Chinoise-et-le-Thibet-1734-Amur-2572.jpg|earlier work]] by [[Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville|d'Anville]], who in his turn made use of the information collected by [[Jesuit missions in China|Jesuits]] in 1709, asserts the existence of Sakhalin—but only assigns to it the northern half of the island and its northeastern coast (with [[Cape Patience]], discovered by [[Maarten Gerritsz Vries|de Vries]] in 1643). Cape Aniva, also discovered by de Vries, and [[Cape Crillon]] (''Black Cape'') are, however, thought to be part of the mainland]]

According to [[Wei Yuan]]'s work ''Military history of the Qing dynasty'' ({{zh|c=聖武記|p=Shèngwǔ Jì}}), the [[Qing dynasty|Later Jin]] sent 400 troops to Sakhalin in 1616 in response to Japanese activity in the area, but later withdrew, judging there to be no major threat to their control of the island.

In an early colonization attempt, a Japanese settlement was established at Ootomari on Sakhalin's southern end in 1679.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karafuto.com/timetab.html Time Table of Sakhalin Island]&lt;/ref&gt; Cartographers of the [[Matsumae clan]] created a map of the island and called it "Kita-Ezo" (Northern Ezo, [[Ezo]] being the old name for the islands north of [[Honshu]]). The 1689 [[Nerchinsk Treaty]] between Russia and China, which defined the [[Stanovoy Mountains]] as their mutual border, made no explicit mention of the island; however, the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) did consider the island to be part of its territory, and enacted policies of a pattern similar to the previous [[Ming dynasty]], which drew Sakhalin further into the "system for subjugated peoples". Local people were forced to pay tribute at Qing posts, and Qing officials sometimes granted titles to local elders, entrusting them with the task of "keeping the peace". By the mid-18th century, Qing officials had registered 56 surname groups; of these, Qing sources note that six clans and 148 households were those of Ainu and Nivkh who came under the Qing administrative umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Conquest of Ainu Lands |last=Walker |first=Brett L. |pages=134–135 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D5iOcHB3h5AC&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;pg=PA134#v=twopage&amp;q |accessdate=June 16, 2010 |isbn=978-0-520-24834-2 |date=February 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the Chinese government did not have a military presence on the island, Japanese attempts at colonization continued.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The first European known to visit Sakhalin was [[Martin Gerritz de Vries]], who mapped [[Cape Patience]] and Cape Aniva on the island's east coast in 1643. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] captain, however, was unaware that it was an island, and 17th century maps usually showed these points (and often Hokkaido as well) as being part of the mainland.

As part of a nationwide Sino-French cartographic program, the [[Jesuit missions in China|Jesuits]] [[Jean-Baptiste Régis]], Pierre Jartoux, and [[Xavier Ehrenbert Fridelli]] joined a Chinese team visiting the lower [[Amur River|Amur]] (known to them under its [[Manchu language|Manchu]] name, Saghalien Ula, i.e. the "Black River"), in 1709,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Description géographique, historique, chronologique, politique, et physique de l'empire de la Chine et de la Tartarie chinoise, enrichie des cartes générales et particulieres de ces pays, de la carte générale et des cartes particulieres du Thibet, &amp; de la Corée; &amp; ornée d'un grand nombre de figures &amp; de vignettes gravées en tailledouce |volume=1 |last=Du Halde |first=Jean-Baptiste |authorlink=Jean-Baptiste Du Halde |year= 1736 |publisher=H.

The Jesuits were told that the islanders were believed to be good at [[reindeer]] husbandry. They reported that the mainlanders used a variety of names to refer to the island, but ''Saghalien anga bata'' (i.e. "the Island [at] the mouth of the Black River") was the most common, while the name "Huye" (presumably, "Kuye", 庫頁), which they had heard in Beijing, was completely unknown to the locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Description géographique, historique, chronologique, politique, et physique de l'empire de la Chine et de la Tartarie chinoise, enrichie des cartes générales et particulieres de ces pays, de la carte générale et des cartes particulieres du Thibet, &amp; de la Corée; &amp; ornée d'un grand nombre de figures &amp; de vignettes gravées en tailledouce |volume=4 |last=Du Halde |first=Jean-Baptiste |authorlink=Jean-Baptiste Du Halde |year= 1736 |publisher=H.

The two groups might thus be ancestral of the [[Ulch people|Ulch]] and [[Nani people|Nanai]] people known to latter ethnologists; or, the "Ke tcheng" might in fact be Nivkhs.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:La-Perouse-Chart-of-Discoveries.jpg|thumb|La Perouse charted most of the southwestern coast of Sakhalin (or "Tchoka", as he heard natives call it) in 1787]]
The Jesuits did not have a chance to visit the island personally, and the geographical information provided by the ''Ke tcheng'' people and Manchus who had been to the island was insufficient to allow them to identify it as the land visited by de Vries in 1643. As a result, many 17th century maps showed a rather strangely shaped Sakhalin, which included only the northern half of the island (with Cape Patience), while Cape Aniva, discovered by de Vries, and the "Black Cape" (Cape Crillon) were thought to be part of the mainland.

It was not until the 1787 expedition of [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse|Jean-François de La Pérouse]] that the island began to resemble something of its true shape on European maps. Though unable to pass through its [[Strait of Nevelskoy|northern "bottleneck"]] due to contrary winds, La Perouse charted most of the [[Strait of Tartary]], and islanders he encountered near today's [[Strait of Nevelskoy]] told him that the island was called "Tchoka" (or at least that is how he recorded the name in French), and it was used on some maps thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jean François de Galaup, comte de|last=La Pérouse

The Russian explorer [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]] visited Sakhalin in 1805, but regarded it as a peninsula.

Alarmed by the visits of European powers, Japan proclaimed its sovereignty over the whole island in 1807. Most Japanese sources claim [[Mamiya Rinzō]] as the true discoverer of the Strait of Tartary, in 1809.

===Russo-Japanese rivalry===
[[File:Anton Chekhov museum Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky file 3.jpg|thumb|Anton Chekhov museum in [[Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky (town)|Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky]], [[Russia]]. It is the house where he stayed in Sakhalin during [[1890]]]]
On the basis of its belief that it was an extension of Hokkaido, both geographically and culturally, Japan again proclaimed sovereignty over the whole island (as well as the [[Kuril Islands]] chain) in 1845, in the face of competing claims from Russia. In 1849, however, the Russian navigator [[Gennady Nevelskoy]] recorded the existence and navigability of the strait later given his name, and – in defiance of the Qing and Japanese claims – Russian settlers began establishing coal mines, administration facilities, schools, and churches on the island.

In 1855, Russia and Japan signed the [[Treaty of Shimoda]], which declared that nationals of both countries could inhabit the island: Russians in the north, and Japanese in the south, without a clearly defined boundary between. Russia also agreed to dismantle its military base at Ootomari. Following the [[Opium War]], Russia forced China to sign the [[Treaty of Aigun]] (1858) and the [[Convention of Peking]] (1860), under which China lost to Russia all claims to territories north of [[Heilongjiang]] ([[Amur River|Amur]]) and east of [[Ussuri]], including Sakhalin.

In 1857 the Russians established a [[katorga|penal colony]]. In 1890 the distinguished author [[Anton Chekhov]] visited the penal colony on Sakhalin and published a memoir of his journey.

[[Japan]] proclaimed its sovereignty over Sakhalin (which they called [[Karafuto]]) yet again in 1865, and the government built a [[stele]] announcing the claim at the northern extremity of the island.  The island remained under shared sovereignty until the signing of the 1875 [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], in which Japan surrendered its claims in Sakhalin to Russia.

===Division===
[[File:Karafuto map.png|thumb|upright|left|Sakhalin Island with Karafuto Prefecture highlighted]]
{{See also|Invasion of Sakhalin|Sakhalin Oblast|Karafuto Prefecture}}

Japanese forces invaded and occupied Sakhalin in the closing stages of the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. In accordance with the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] of 1905, the southern part of the island below the [[50th parallel north]] reverted to Japan, while Russia retained the northern three-fifths. In 1920, during the [[Siberian Intervention]], Japan again occupied the northern part of the island, returning it to the Soviet Union in 1925.

South Sakhalin was administered by Japan as [[Karafuto Prefecture]] ({{nihongo|Karafuto-chō|樺太庁}}), with the capital at [[Toyohara]] (today's [[Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk]]). A large number of migrants were brought in from Korea.

The northern, Russian, half of the island formed [[Sakhalin Oblast]], with the capital at [[Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky (town)|Aleksandrovsk-Sakhalinsky]].

===Second World War===
{{See also|Invasion of South Sakhalin}}

In August 1945, after repudiating the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact, the Soviet Union invaded southern Sakhalin. The Soviet attack started on August 11, 1945, a few days before the surrender of Japan. The Soviet [[56th Rifle Corps]], part of the [[16th Army (Soviet Union)|16th Army]], consisting of the [[79th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|79th Rifle Division]], the 2nd Rifle Brigade, the 5th Rifle Brigade and the [[214th Tank Brigade|214 Armored Brigade]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://niehorster.org/012_ussr/45-08-08/army_16.html 16th Army, 2nd Far Eastern Front, Soviet Far East Command, 09.08,45&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; attacked the Japanese [[88th Infantry Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|88th Infantry Division]]. Although the Soviet Red Army outnumbered the Japanese by three to one, they advanced only slowly due to strong Japanese resistance. It was not until the 113th Rifle Brigade and the 365th Independent Naval Infantry Rifle Battalion from Sovetskaya Gavan landed on Tōro, a seashore village of western Karafuto on August 16 that the Soviets broke the Japanese defense line. Japanese resistance grew weaker after this landing. Actual fighting continued until August 21. From August 22 to August 23, most remaining Japanese units agreed to a ceasefire. The Soviets completed the conquest of Karafuto on August 25, 1945 by occupying the capital of [[Toyohara]].

Of the approximately 400,000 people – mostly Japanese and Korean – who lived on South Sakhalin in 1944, about 100,000 were [[Evacuation of Karafuto and Kuriles|evacuated to Japan]] during the last days of the war.

[[File:Cape Tihii. Sakhalin coast of Sea of Okhotsk.JPG|thumb|Cape Tihii, Sakhalin]]

Sakhalin is separated from the mainland by the narrow and shallow [[Strait of Tartary]], which often freezes in winter in its narrower part, and from [[Hokkaido]], [[Japan]] by the Soya Strait or [[La Pérouse Strait]]. Sakhalin is the largest island in Russia, being {{convert|948|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and {{convert|25|to|170|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} wide, with an area of {{convert|72492|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref name="islands.unep.ch"/&gt;

Crystalline rocks crop out at several capes; [[Cretaceous]] [[limestone]]s, containing an abundant and specific fauna of gigantic [[ammonite]]s, occur at Dui on the west coast; and [[Tertiary]] [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]], [[sandstone]]s, [[marl]]s, and [[clay]]s, folded by subsequent upheavals, are found in many parts of the island. The clays, which contain layers of good coal and abundant fossilized vegetation, show that during the Miocene period, Sakhalin formed part of a continent which comprised north Asia, Alaska, and Japan, and enjoyed a comparatively warm climate. The [[Pliocene]] deposits contain a mollusc fauna more Arctic than that which exists at the present time, indicating that the connection between the Pacific and [[Arctic Ocean]]s was probably broader than it is now.

Main rivers: The [[Tym River, Sakhalin|Tym]], {{convert|330|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} long and navigable by rafts and light boats for {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on|0}}, flows north and northeast with numerous rapids and shallows, and enters the [[Sea of Okhotsk]].&lt;ref name="Tym"&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/~книги/БСЭ/Тымь Tym] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514230908/http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%A2%D1%8B%D0%BC%D1%8C |date=May 14, 2013 }} – an article in the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]''. (In Russian, retrieved 2012-08-21.)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Poronai River]] flows south-southeast to the [[Gulf of Patience]] or Shichiro Bay, on the southeastern coast. Three other small streams enter the wide semicircular [[Gulf of Aniva]] or Higashifushimi Bay at the southern extremity of the island.

The northernmost point of Sakhalin is [[Cape of Elisabeth]] on the Schmidt Peninsula, while [[Cape Crillon]] is the southernmost point of the island.

Sakhalin has two smaller islands associated with it, [[Moneron Island]] and [[Ush Island]]. Moneron, the only land mass in the Tatar strait, {{convert|7.2|km|mi|abbr=on|1}} long and {{convert|5.6|km|mi|abbr=on|1}} wide, is about {{convert|24|nmi|km}} west from the nearest coast of Sakhalin and {{convert|41|nmi|km|abbr=on}} from the port city of Nevelsk. Ush Island is an island off of the northern coast of Sakhalin.

==Demographics==
[[File:V.M. Doroshevich-Sakhalin. Part II. Nivkh Children.png|thumb|Nivkh children in Sakhalin around 1903]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, some 32,000 Russians (of whom over 22,000 were convicts) inhabited Sakhalin along with several thousand native inhabitants. In 2010, the island's population was recorded at 497,973, 83% of whom were ethnic [[Russians]], followed by about 30,000 [[Sakhalin Koreans|Koreans]] (5.5%). Smaller minorities were  [[Ukrainians]],  [[Tatars]], [[Yakuts]] and [[Evenks]]. The native inhabitants consist of some 2,000 [[Nivkh people|Nivkhs]] and 750 Oroks. The Nivkhs in the north support themselves by fishing and hunting. In 2008 there were 6,416 births and 7,572 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vostokmedia.com/n36536.html |script-title=ru:Сахалин становится островом близнецов? |trans-title=Sakhalin is an island of twins? |author= |date=February 13, 2009 |language=Russian |publisher=Восток Медиа [Vostok Media] |accessdate=June 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717093922/http://www.vostokmedia.com/n36536.html |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrative center of the oblast, [[Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk]], a city of about 175,000, has a large Korean minority, typically referred to as [[Sakhalin Koreans]], who were forcibly brought by the Japanese during [[World War II]] to work in the coal mines. Most of the population lives in the southern half of the island, centered mainly around Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk and two ports, [[Kholmsk]] and [[Korsakov (town)|Korsakov]] (population about 40,000 each).

The 400,000 [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese]] inhabitants of Sakhalin (including all indigenous [[Ainu people|Ainu]]) were deported following the invasion of the southern portion of the island by the Soviet Union in 1945 at the end of World War II.

==Climate==
The Sea of Okhotsk ensures Sakhalin has a cold and humid climate, ranging from [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb'') in the south to [[subarctic climate|subarctic]] (''Dfc'') in the centre and north. The maritime influence makes summers much cooler than in similar-latitude inland cities such as [[Harbin]] or [[Irkutsk]], but makes the winters much more snowy and a few degrees warmer than in interior East Asian cities at the same latitude. Summers are foggy with little sunshine&lt;ref&gt;[http://sakhmeteo.ru/en/ Sakhalin Hydrometeorological Service, accessed 19 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2014}}.

Precipitation is heavy, owing to the strong onshore winds in summer and the high frequency of North Pacific storms affecting the island in the autumn. It ranges from around {{convert|500|mm|in}} on the northwest coast to over {{convert|1200|mm|in}} in southern mountainous regions. In contrast to interior east Asia with its pronounced summer maximum, onshore winds ensure Sakhalin has year-round precipitation with a peak in the autumn.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1974"/&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
[[File:Sakhalin-gray-whale-small.jpg|thumb|Western Gray whale near Sakhalin]]
[[File:Sakhalin butterfly.jpg|thumb|''[[Anaphalis margaritacea]]'' with peacock butterfly]]
The whole of the island is covered with dense [[forest]]s, mostly [[conifer]]ous. The [[Picea jezoensis|Yezo]] (or Yeddo) spruce (''Picea jezoensis''), the [[Abies sachalinensis|Sakhalin fir]] (''Abies sachalinensis'') and the [[Dahurian larch]] (''Larix gmelinii'') are the chief trees; on the upper parts of the mountains are the [[Siberian dwarf pine]] (''Pinus pumila'') and the Kurile bamboo (''Sasa kurilensis''). [[Birch]]es, both Siberian silver birch (''[[Betula platyphylla]]'') and [[Erman's birch]] (''B. ermanii''), [[Populus|poplar]], [[elm]], [[Prunus padus|bird cherry]] (''Prunus padus''), [[Japanese yew]] (''Taxus cuspidata''), and several [[willow]]s are mixed with the conifers; while farther south the [[maple]], [[rowan]] and [[oak]], as also the Japanese ''Panax ricinifolium'', the [[Amur cork tree]] (''Phellodendron amurense''), the [[spindle (shrub)|Spindle]] (''Euonymus macropterus'') and the vine (''[[Vitis thunbergii]]'') make their appearance. The underwoods abound in berry-bearing plants (e.g. [[cloudberry]], [[cranberry]], [[crowberry]], [[red whortleberry]]), red-berried elder (''[[Sambucus racemosa]]''), wild [[Rubus idaeus|raspberry]], and [[Spiraea]].

[[Bear]]s, [[fox]]es, [[otter]]s, and [[sable]]s are numerous, as are [[reindeer]] in the north, and [[musk deer]], [[hare]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[rat]]s, and [[mice]] everywhere. The [[bird]] population is mostly the common east Siberian, but there are some [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] or near-endemic breeding species, notably the [[Conservation status|endangered]] [[Nordmann's greenshank]] (''Tringa guttifer'') and the [[Sakhalin leaf warbler]] (''Phylloscopus borealoides''). The rivers swarm with [[fish]], especially species of [[salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus''). Numerous [[whale]]s visit the sea coast, including the [[critically endangered]] Western Pacific [[gray whale]], for which the coast of Sakhalin is the only known feeding ground. Other endangered whale species known to occur in this area are the [[North Pacific right whale]], the [[bowhead whale]], and the [[beluga whale]].

==Transport==
[[File:Japanese SL D51-22.jpg|thumb|A Japanese [[D51 steam locomotive]] outside the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Railway Station]]

===Sea===
{{Main|Sakhalin Shipping Company}}
Transport, especially by sea, is an important segment of the economy. Nearly all the cargo arriving for Sakhalin (and the [[Kuril Islands]]) is delivered by cargo boats, or by ferries, in railway wagons, through the [[Vanino-Kholmsk train ferry]] from the mainland port of [[Vanino, Khabarovsk Krai|Vanino]] to Kholmsk. The ports of Korsakov and Kholmsk are the largest and handle all kinds of goods, while [[coal]] and [[timber]] shipments often go through other ports. In 1999, a ferry service was opened between the ports of Korsakov and [[Wakkanai]], Japan, and operated through the autumn of 2015, when service was suspended.

For the 2016 summer season, this route will be served by a highspeed catamaran ferry from Singapore named Penguin 33. The ferry is owned by [http://www.penguin.com.sg Penguin International Limited] and operated by [http://www.sasco.ru/en-main-page-op-i1 Sakhalin Shipping Company].

Sakhalin's main shipping company is [[Sakhalin Shipping Company]], headquartered in Kholmsk on the island's west coast.

===Rail===
[[File:Sakhalin Train.jpg|thumb|A passenger train in [[Nogliki]]]]
About 30 percent of all inland transport volume is carried by the island's railways, most of which are organized as the [[Sakhalin Railway]] ([[:ru:Сахалинская железная дорога|Сахалинская железная дорога]]), which is one of the 17 territorial divisions of the [[Russian Railways]].

The [[Sakhalin Railway]] network extends from [[Nogliki]] in the north to [[Korsakov (town)|Korsakov]] in the south. Sakhalin's railway has a connection with the rest of Russia via a [[Vanino-Kholmsk train ferry|train ferry]] operating between [[Vanino, Khabarovsk Krai|Vanino]] and [[Kholmsk]].

{{As of|2004}}, the railways are only now being converted from the Japanese {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge to the Russian {{RailGauge|1520mm}} gauge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.rzd.ru/isvp/public/rzdeng?STRUCTURE_ID=193 |title=Sakhalin Railways |year=2007 |publisher=[[Russian Railways|JSC Russian Railways]] |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716191818/http://www.eng.rzd.ru/isvp/public/rzdeng?STRUCTURE_ID=193 |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Steam and the Railways of Sakhalin Island |last=Dickinson |first=Rob |date= |work= |publisher=International Steam Page |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080217154833/http://www.steam.dial.pipex.com/trains/russia02.htm |archivedate=February 17, 2008 |accessdate=June 16, 2010|url=http://www.steam.dial.pipex.com/trains/russia02.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Japanese [[D51 steam locomotive]]s were used by the Soviet Railways until 1979.

Besides the main network run by the Russian Railways, until December 2006 the local oil company (Sakhalinmorneftegaz) operated a corporate narrow-gauge {{RailGauge|750mm}} line extending for {{convert|228|km|mi|sp=us}} from Nogliki further north to [[Okha, Russia|Okha]] ([[:ru:Узкоколейная железная дорога Оха — Ноглики|Узкоколейная железная дорога Оха — Ноглики]]). During the last years of its service, it gradually deteriorated; the service was terminated in December 2006, and the line was dismantled in 2007–2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infojd.ru/19/ohanog_2006.html |script-title=ru:Узкоколейная железная дорога Оха — Ноглики |trans-title=Okha-Nogliki narrow-gauge railway |first=Serguei (Болашенко, С.) |last=Bolashenko |date=July 6, 2006 |work=САЙТ О ЖЕЛЕЗНОЙ ДОРОГЕ |publisher= |language=Russian |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715020713/http://infojd.ru/19/ohanog_2006.html |archivedate=July 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===

Sakhalin is connected by regular flights to [[Moscow]], [[Khabarovsk]], [[Vladivostok]] and other cities of Russia. [[Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport]] has regularly scheduled international flights to [[Hakodate]], Japan, and [[Seoul]] and [[Busan]], South Korea. There are also charter flights to the Japanese cities of [[Tokyo]], [[Niigata, Niigata|Niigata]], and [[Sapporo]] and to the Chinese cities of [[Shanghai]], [[Dalian]] and [[Harbin]]. The island was formerly served by [[Alaska Airlines]] from [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]], and [[Magadan]].

===Fixed links===
The idea of building a [[bridge|fixed link]] between Sakhalin and the Russian mainland was first put forwarded in the 1930s. In the 1940s, an abortive attempt was made to link the island via a {{convert|10|km|mi|adj=mid|-long|0}} undersea [[Sakhalin Tunnel|tunnel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Railway a Gauge of Sakhalin's Future |last=''[[The Moscow Times]]'' |first= |work=The RZD-Partner |date=July 7, 2008 |url=http://www.rzd-partner.com/press/2008/07/07/327041.html |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909005413/http://www.rzd-partner.com/press/2008/07/07/327041.html |archivedate=September 9, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project  was abandoned under Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. In 2000, the Russian government revived the idea, adding a suggestion that a 40-km-long bridge could be constructed between Sakhalin and the Japanese island of Hokkaidō, providing Japan with a direct connection to the [[Eurasia]]n railway network. It was claimed that construction work could begin as early as 2001. The idea was received skeptically by the Japanese government and appears to have been shelved, probably permanently, after the cost was estimated at as much as $50 billion.

In November 2008, Russian president [[Dmitry Medvedev]] announced government support for the construction of the [[Sakhalin Tunnel]], along with the required regauging of the island's railways to Russian standard gauge, at an estimated cost of 300–330 billion [[rouble]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primamedia.ru/news/show/?id=85418 |script-title=ru:Президент России хочет остров Сахалин соединить с материком |trans-title=President of Russia wants to join Sakhalin Island to the mainland |date=November 19, 2008 |work= |publisher=PrimaMedia |language=Russian |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Russian Far East development minister [[Viktor Ishayev]] proposed a [[railway]] bridge to link Sakhalin with the Russian mainland. He also again suggested a bridge between Sakhalin and Hokkaidō, which could potentially create a continuous rail corridor between Europe and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/minister-proposes-7km-bridge-to-sakhalin-island/483353.html|publisher=The Moscow Times|title=Minister Proposes 7km Bridge to Sakhalin Island|work=RIA Novosti|date=July 19, 2013|accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, president [[Vladimir Putin]] ordered a feasibility study for a mainland bridge project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/business/434112-putin-orders-construction-sakhalin-bridge/|title=Putin orders construction of world’s longest bridge|publisher=RT|date=24 July 2018|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Sakhalin-II LNG production plant opening.jpg|thumb|At the ceremony marking the opening of a liquefied [[natural gas]] production plant built as part of the Sakhalin-2 project.]]
Sakhalin is a classic "[[primary sector of the economy]]" relying on [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[gas]] exports, [[coal mining]], [[forestry]], and [[Fishing industry|fishing]]. Limited quantities of [[rye]], [[wheat]], [[oat]]s, [[barley]] and [[vegetable]]s are grown, although the [[growing season]] averages less than 100 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1974"/&gt;

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and economic liberalization, Sakhalin has experienced an oil [[wikt:boom|boom]] with extensive petroleum exploration and mining by most large oil [[multinational corporations]]. The oil and natural gas reserves contain an estimated 14 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] [[Barrel (unit)|barrels]] (2.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of oil and 2,700&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (96 [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] cubic feet) of gas and are being developed under production-sharing agreement contracts involving international oil companies like [[ExxonMobil]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]].

In 1996, two large consortia signed contracts to explore for oil and gas off the northeast coast of the island, [[Sakhalin-I]] and [[Sakhalin-II]]. The two consortia were estimated to spend a combined [[United States dollar|US$]]21 billion on the two projects which almost doubled to $37 billion as of September 2006, triggering Russian governmental opposition. The cost will include an estimated US$1 billion to upgrade the island's infrastructure: roads, bridges, [[waste management]] sites, airports, railways, communications systems, and ports. In addition, Sakhalin-III-through-VI are in various early stages of development.

The Sakhalin I project, managed by [[Exxon Neftegas Limited]] (ENL), completed a production-sharing agreement (PSA) between the Sakhalin I consortium, the Russian Federation, and the Sakhalin government. Russia is in the process of building a {{convert|220|km|abbr=on}} pipeline across the Tatar Strait from Sakhalin Island to [[De-Kastri terminal]] on the Russian mainland. From De-Kastri, the resource will be loaded onto tankers for transport to East Asian markets, namely Japan, South Korea and China.

The second consortium, Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd (Sakhalin Energy), is managing the Sakhalin II project. It completed the first production-sharing agreement (PSA) with the Russian Federation. Sakhalin Energy will build two 800-km pipelines running from the northeast of the island to Prigorodnoye (Prigorodnoe) in Aniva Bay at the southern end. The consortium will also build, at Prigorodnoye, the first  [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) plant to be built in Russia. The oil and gas are also bound for East Asian markets.

Sakhalin II has come under fire from environmental groups, namely Sakhalin Environment Watch, for dumping dredging material in Aniva Bay. These groups were also worried about the offshore pipelines interfering with the migration of whales off the island. The consortium has (as of January 2006) rerouted the pipeline to avoid the whale migration. After a doubling in the projected cost, the Russian government threatened to halt the project for environmental reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Russia_Threatens_To_Halt_Sakhalin_2_Project_Unless_Shell_Cleans_Up_999.html |title=Russia Threatens To Halt Sakhalin-2 Project Unless Shell Cleans Up |last= |first= |date=September 26, 2006 |work= |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |publisher=Terra Daily |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been suggestions that the Russian government is using the environmental issues as a pretext for obtaining a greater share of revenues from the project and/or forcing involvement by the state-controlled [[Gazprom]]. The cost overruns (at least partly due to Shell's response to environmental concerns), are reducing the share of profits flowing to the Russian treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia Halts Pipeline, Citing River Damage |last=Kramer |first=Andrew E. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 19, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/19/business/worldbusiness/19shell.html |page=C.11 |accessdate=June 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cynical in Sakhalin |last= |first= |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |location=London |date=September 26, 2006 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/4d84c734-481c-11db-a42e-0000779e2340.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A deal is a deal |last= |first= |newspaper=[[The Times]] |location=London |date=September 22, 2006 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article646878.ece |accessdate=June 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=CEO delivers message at Sakhalin's first major energy conference |url=http://www.sakhalinenergy.com/en/default.asp?p=channel&amp;c=1&amp;n=130 |publisher=[[Sakhalin Energy]] |date=September 27, 2006 |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101062629/http://www.sakhalinenergy.com/en/default.asp?p=channel&amp;c=1&amp;n=130 |archivedate=November 1, 2007 }} Citations for the date: {{cite press release |title=Sakhalin II: Laying the Base for Future Arctic Developments in Russia |url=http://www.sakhalin-2.ru/en/media.asp?p=media_page&amp;itmID=185 |publisher=Sakhalin Energy |date=September 27, 2006 |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214120631/http://www.sakhalin-2.ru/en/media.asp?p=media_page&amp;itmID=185 |archivedate=December 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }} {{cite web|url=http://qa.sakhalin-2.com/en/media.asp?p=home&amp;yr=2006|title=Media Archives 2006|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=Sakhalin Energy|accessdate=June 17, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715225759/http://qa.sakhalin-2.com/en/media.asp?p=home&amp;yr=2006|archivedate=July 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the oil and gas industry accounted for 57.5% of Sakhalin's industrial output. By 2006, it is expected to account for 80% of the island's industrial output. Sakhalin's economy is growing rapidly thanks to its oil and gas industry. By 2005, the island had become the largest recipient of foreign investment in Russia, followed by Moscow. Unemployment in 2002 was only two percent{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

As of 18 April 2007, Gazprom has taken a 50 percent plus one share interest in Sakhalin II by purchasing 50 percent of Shell, Mitsui and Mitsubishi's shares.

[[File:Nemetskaya.jpg|thumb|[[German Sloboda]] in 17th-century [[Moscow]]]]

A '''sloboda''' ({{lang-rus|слобода́|p=sləbɐˈda}}) was a kind of settlement in the history of [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. The name is derived from the early Slavic word for "[[liberty|freedom]]" and may be loosely translated as "(tax-)free settlement".&lt;ref name="efron"&gt;[http://www.vehi.net/brokgauz/all/094/94755.shtml "Sloboda"], [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]] (1890-1906) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern Russia, the term is used to denote a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|type of a rural locality]] and is used in [[Kursk Oblast|Kursk]], [[Lipetsk Oblast|Lipetsk]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Oryol Oblast|Oryol]], [[Rostov Oblast|Rostov]], [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]], [[Tula Oblast|Tula]], and [[Voronezh Oblast]]s.

==History==
Often a ''sloboda'' was a colonization-type settlement in sparsely populated lands, particularly by [[Cossacks]] in [[Cossack Hetmanate]], see "[[Sloboda Ukraine]]". Initially, the settlers of such ''sloboda'' were freed from various taxes and levies for various reasons, hence the name. Freedom from taxes was an incentive for [[colonization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vehi.net/brokgauz/all/092/92279.shtml "Selitba" (Settlementing)], [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]] (1890-1906) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the first half of the 18th century, this privilege was abolished, and ''slobodas'' became ordinary [[village]]s, ''[[shtetl]]s'', [[townlet (p.g.t.)|townlet]]s, suburbs.

Some ''slobodas'' were suburban settlements, right behind the city wall.&lt;ref name=efron/&gt; Many of them were subsequently incorporated into cities, and the corresponding [[toponym]]s indicate their origin, such as Ogorodnaya Sloboda Lane, [[Moscow]] ([[:ru:Переулок Огородная Слобода]]).&lt;!-- please replace with a more famous "sloboda" --&gt;

The [[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]] writes that by the end of the 19th century a sloboda was a large village with more than one church, a marketplace, and ''[[volost]]'' administration, or a village-type settlement of industrial character, where the peasants have little involvement in [[agriculture]].&lt;ref name=efron/&gt;

The term is preserved in names of various settlements and city quarters. Some settlements were named just thus: "Sloboda", "Slobodka" (diminutive form), "Slabodka", "Slobidka" ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]).

Similar settlements existed in [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], called ''slobozie'' or ''slobozia''. The latter term is also the name of [[Slobozia|the capital city]] of [[Ialomiţa County]] in modern [[Romania]], located in the historical region of Wallachia.

'''''Stratum Pier''''' is an [[interactive art|interactive]] [[overlook]] by [[United States|American]] artist [[Kendall Buster]].

==Description==

Based on a section of a [[topographical map]] of 100 Acres the artwork consists of [[emerald green]] layered platforms that are shaped in a flowing organic manner along the south side of the sculpture parks lake. The artwork consists of [[fiberglass]] grids that sit upon a support system made of [[steel]]. The support system sits at varied heights.&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt; Visitors are welcome to walk on, sit, fish at and explore the structure, which is occasionally non-accessible due to flooding.&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheets1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rockey"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=| title=Indianapolis Museum of Art - Stratum Pier | work=Projects| publisher=Rockey Structures | url=http://www.rockeystructures.com/project20.html | accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==

''Stratum Pier'' was created to appear as if it is an extension of the [[shoreline]], exhibiting artist Kendall Buster's desire to merge "the natural and the built environment." A visit to the structure allows one to view the cycles of [[erosion]] and growth in the 100 Acres environment, cycles that are represented in ''Stratum Pier''s layered build.&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt;  Fiberglass was chosen due to its light weight allowing it to easily sit in its present location and its durability which allows for heavy use by visitors to the park. Buster started to design the piece after a visit to the park and inspiration from the topographical maps created to document the parks environment.&lt;ref name="IMATV1"&gt;{{cite video |people= |date=19 July 2010 |title=IMA TV: Kendall Buster's Stratum Pier  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_NZdVDfd04 |format=Web|medium=Digital |trans_title= |publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=6 April 2011 |time=  |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buster expects the work to merge with the landscape as the grass and brush that surrounds the area grows into the work.&lt;ref name="Buster"/&gt;

Buster worked with [[architect]] Jeremy Olsen of Wheeler Kearns and project [[engineer]] Chris Rockey of Rockey Structures to create the piece.&lt;ref name="Rockey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buster"&gt;{{cite web | author=Kendall Buster | year=| title=Stratum Pier, 2010 | work=Projects| publisher=Kendall Buster | url=http://www.kendallbuster.com/projects_text/stratumpiertx.html | accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork was commissioned by the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] and funded by a grant from [[The Indianapolis Foundation]].&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt; In June 2010 Indianapolis based Motus Dance Theatre performed one day, every 45 minutes, on ''Stratum Pier'' in response to the installation and to celebrate the opening of the park.&lt;ref name="Motus"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=| title=Past Performances | work=Performances/Events| publisher=Motus Dance Theatre | url=http://motusdance.com/performancesevents/pastperformances/ | accessdate= 19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt is divided, for the purpose of [[public administration]], according to a three-layer hierarchy and some districts are further subdivided, creating an occasional fourth-layer.

The top-level of the hierarchy are 27 governorates (singular: {{lang|arz|محافظة}} ''{{transl|arz|muḥāfẓa}}'', plural: {{lang|ar|محافظات}} ''{{transl|arz|muḥāfẓat}}''). The second-level, beneath and within governorates, are [[Markaz (country subdivision)|marakiz]] (singular: {{lang|ar|مركز}} ''{{transl|arz|markaz}}'', plural: {{lang|ar|مراكز}} ''{{transl|arz|marakiz}}'') or aqsam (singular: {{lang|arz|قسم}} ''qism'', plural: {{lang|arz|أقسام}} ''{{transl|arz|aqsam}})''. The third-level is composed of districts (singular: {{lang|arz|حي}} ''{{transl|arz|ḥay}}'', plural: {{lang|arz|أحياء}} {{transl|arz|aḥya'}}) and villages (singular: {{lang|arz|قرية}} ''{{transl|arz|qarya}}'', plural: {{lang|ar|قرى}} ''{{transl|arz|qura}}''). There is a governing structure at each of these levels.&lt;ref name="USAID"&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt: The Basic Village Services Program|url=https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR029.pdf|website=USAID|accessdate=19 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019144503/https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDAAR029.pdf|archivedate=19 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metz|first1=Helen Chapin|title=Egypt: A Country Study.

There are also seven economic [[Regions of Egypt|regions]] for other planning purposes, as defined by the General Organization for Physical Planning (GOPP).

==Submunicipal divisions==
The village is the smallest local unit in rural communities, and is the equivalent of a district in urban areas. However, villages differ from each other in terms of legal status. The heads of villages or districts are appointed by the respective governors. &lt;ref name="woman"&gt;{{cite news|title=Governor appoints first woman to head municipality in Egypt's Alexandria|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/133238/Egypt/Politics-/Governor-appoints-first-woman-to-head-municipality.aspx|accessdate=19 October 2016|agency=Ahram Online|date=June 20, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019153751/http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/133238/Egypt/Politics-/Governor-appoints-first-woman-to-head-municipality.aspx|archivedate=19 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, districts are occasionally further divided into sub-district neighborhoods called ''[[sheyakha]]'' in rural areas, or ''residential districts'' (singular: {{lang|arz|حي سكني}} ''{{transl|arz|ḥay sakani}}'', plural: {{lang|arz|أحياء سكنية  }} ''{{transl|arz|aḥya' sakaniya}}'') in urban areas.&lt;ref name="third-level"&gt;{{cite book|title=Broadband Networks in the Middle East and North Africa: Accelerating High-Speed Internet Access|date=February 11, 2014|publisher=World Bank Publication|page=33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sF3bAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=Sheyakha&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq2Lb-g-bPAhWLGB4KHYIlB7IQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sheyakha&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171126024732/https://books.google.com/books?id=sF3bAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=Sheyakha&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq2Lb-g-bPAhWLGB4KHYIlB7IQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sheyakha&amp;f=false|archivedate=26 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All phone numbers in [[Morocco]] are 9 digits in length (excluding the leading 0).

Morocco uses a closed numbering plan, i.e. the area code is not omitted for local calls. This is necessary because Morocco makes heavy use of overlay codes, i. e. the same geographic area can be served by several area codes. [[Casablanca]], for instance, has 10 area codes.

Fixed and mobile area codes belong exclusively to one phone company. On the following list, fixed networks are indicated by the following letters:
I = Itissalat Al-Maghrib (fixed), M = Médi Telecom (NGN), W = WANA (Maroc Connect) (fixed NGN), X = WANA (Maroc Connect) (fixed GSM(?))

==History==
===1990 - Transition to 6-digit numbers===
In 1990, 6-digit phone numbers were introduced.

===199x - Transition from 6-digit to 7-digit numbers===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===2000 - Transition from 7-digit to 8-digit numbers===
On 2000-10-13 at 23:00 UTC, the numbering area in Morocco was split into 5 parts by adding another digit to all area codes in Morocco.

===2006 - Merger of 04 into 02 and 05 into 03===
Six years later (2006-03-24 23:00 UTC), part of this split was reverted in order to make room for cellular networks. The 04 numbering area was merged into 02 and 05 was merged into 03, which caused 02 to cover the South while 03 covered the North. This could be done easily because there were no conflicts.

===2009 - Transition from 8-digit to 9-digit numbers===
On 2009-03-07 at 02:00 UTC, phone numbers in Morocco got another additional digit. A 5 was prepended to all fixed numbers while a 6 was prepended to mobile numbers. The 08 numbers became 080 and 09 became 089.

'''Vibjörn (Wibjörn) Karlén''' (born 26 August 1937 in [[Kristine, Sweden|Kristine]], [[Kopparberg County]], [[Sweden]]), [[Ph.D.]], is a [[professor emeritus]] of [[physical geography]] and [[quaternary geology]] at [[Stockholm University]], [[Sweden]].

In an article which describes Karlén as a paleoclimatologist, he is quoted as saying: "One of the big problems with trying to determine long-term temperature changes, is that weather records only go back to about 1860. By relying on statistical reconstruction of the last 1000 years, using only the temperature patterns of the last 140 years instead of actual temperature readings, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] report and Summary missed both a major cooling period as well as a significant warming trend during that millennium."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Karlen| first = Wibjorn | title =  Kyoto's Fatal Flaws Revealed| publisher =  sepp.org| date =30 May 2000 | url = http://www.sepp.org/Archive/NewSEPP/BriefingMay30.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Karlén has also criticized the mainstream media for "spreading the exaggerated views of a human impact on climate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocregister.com/opinion/global-gore-warming-1951764-consensus-carbon Opinion: Editorial: Global warming 'consensus' a fiction - OCRegister.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named in a 2007 minority report of the [[U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee]] as one of 400 "prominent scientists" who were said to dispute global warming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.SenateReport : U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works :: Minority Page :&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he predicted that natural climate changes, caused to a large degree by the sun's activity, would more likely make the climate colder than warmer in the next decades.&lt;ref name=exp&gt;Wibjörn Karlén (7 January 2010) [http://www.expressen.se/debatt/lilla-istiden-kan-redan-vara-har/ Lilla istiden kan redan vara här] Expressen. Retrieved 16 January 2014 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a contributing author to the [[Fraser Institute]] 2007 Independent Summary for Policymakers.

Karlén is a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.kva.se/en/contact/Kontakt-sida/?personId=121 Wibjörn Karlén] Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien. Retrieved 16 January 2014 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=exp/&gt;

The '''World Road Association''' ('''WRA''') is an [[international]] [[:wikt:forum|forum]] for the discussion of all aspects of [[road]]s and [[road network]]s.

== Overview ==
Though established principally for [[professional]]s in its 122 member countries round the world, it also provides an overview of the policies and trends that affect all road users. The Association was founded in 1909&lt;ref name=WRA1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.piarc.org/en/|title=The World Road Association-PIARC |quote=The World Road Association-PIARC was established in 1909. It brings together the road administrations of 121 governments and has members -individuals, companies, authorities and organizations- in over 140 countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;, following the first international road [[congress]] held in [[Paris]] when it was the called the '''Association Internationale Permanente des Congrès de la Route''' (AIPCR), or in English, the '''Permanent International Association of Road Congresses''' (PIARC). Although the name has changed, the association still retains the original abbreviations in its logo and texts.

Its head office is located in Paris. Where its origins began in 1908.

==Terminology==

In 1931, the first edition of the "Road Dictionary" was published in six languages (Danish, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish). The World Road Association has continued working on terminology ever since. In 2007, the eight edition was released in five languages (English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish).

The '''Zuidplaspolder''' is a [[polder]] in the western [[Netherlands]], located northeast of [[Rotterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.geschiedenisvanzuidholland.nl/locatie/geschiedenis-van-nieuwerkerk-aan-den-ijssel|title = Geschiedenis van Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Erfgoedhuis Zuid-Holland|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It reaches a depth of {{Convert|6.76|m|ft|1}} [[Amsterdam Ordnance Datum|below average sea level]]. This makes it, along with [[Lammefjord]] in [[Denmark]], the lowest point of [[Western Europe]] and the [[European Union]].
