'''Abraham of Egypt''' or '''Abraham of Minuf''' was a fourth-century monk and hermit of [[Egypt]], is known only from the [[Synaxarium|Synaxarion]].&lt;ref&gt;Basset, Synaxarion, 1904, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a native of [[List of towns and villages in Egypt|Minuf]] in the Delta, born of Christian parents who held an important position in the world. We do not know at what age he joined the monastic life. From the [[Synaxarium|ancient text]] we know only that "when he grew up, he went off to the land of [[Akhmim]], to join the great [[Pachomius the Great|Pachomius]], who gave him the religious habit." He remained there for twenty-three years.

Then he asked the permission to leave and live as a hermit in a cavern, where he stayed for sixteen years, leaving it only to receive communion every two or three years. He had at his service only a secular brother who was making fishing nets, and selling them to buy beans for him, giving alms with the rest of the money.

When Abraham felt his death coming, he sent for [[Theodorus of Tabennese|Abba Theodore]], disciple of Pachomius, then he lay down facing the east. He was buried by the monks in the cemetery of the monastery. The mention of Theodore indicates that Abraham lived at the end of the fourth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/search/collection/cce/page/2/ Abraham of Minuf, Saint] Retrieved on 5 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is considered a [[saint]] in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]], who hold his [[feast day]] on May 21.

'''Alexander Comfort''' (10 February 1920&amp;nbsp;– 26 March 2000) was a British scientist and physician known best for his [[Sexual revolution#Nonfiction sex manuals|nonfiction sex manual]], ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' (1972). He was an author of both fiction and nonfiction, as well as a [[gerontologist]], [[anarchist]], [[pacifist]], and [[conscientious objector]].&lt;ref name="dg"&gt;[[David Goodway]], "Introduction" to ''Writings Against power and death: the anarchist articles and pamphlets of Alex Comfort''. London : Freedom Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0900384719}} (pp. 7–30)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Comfort was educated at [[Highgate School]] in London. While a student there, he attempted to develop a superior concoction of [[gunpowder]]. During his experiments he inadvertently exploded his left hand, of which only the thumb remained. (Later in life, he claimed that his left hand proved "very useful for performing [[uterine inversion]]s".) This story is used as evidence of his single-mindedness.&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite news|last=Levy|first=Ariel|title=Doing It: A new edition of "The Joy of Sex."|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/01/05/090105crbo_books_levy?currentPage=all|accessdate=2 July 2012|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=5 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He matriculated at [[Cambridge University]]'s [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] to study medicine, qualifying during 1944 with both the [[Conjoint]] diplomas of Licentiate of the [[Royal College of Physicians]]&amp;nbsp;(LRCP) London, [[Member of the Royal College of Surgeons]]&amp;nbsp;(MRCS) England and the Cambridge Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery or [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MB BChir]] degrees.&lt;ref name="dg" /&gt; All in all, he accrued six degrees.

Comfort had a passion for [[Mollusca|molluscs]] and joined the [[Conchological Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland]] when he was eighteen years old and made many contributions to the literature.&lt;ref name=Dance&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dance|first1=S Peter|title=Comfort and joy among the snails of Chaldon|journal=Mollusc World|date=2010|issue=24|page=12|url=http://www.conchsoc.org/MolluscWorld24/6|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Comfort served as a House Physician for the [[London Hospital]] and later became a lecturer in physiology at the London Hospital Medical College. During 1945 he obtained the Conjoint Board's Diploma in Child Health, and progressed to a PhD during 1950 and a DSc of [[University College, London]] during 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = The Medical Directory 1969 |publisher = J &amp; A Churchill | year = 1969 | location = London | edition = 125 | page = 356 | isbn =978-0-7000-1400-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pacifist, Comfort considered himself "an aggressive anti-militarist", and he believed that pacifism rested "solely upon the historical theory of anarchism".&lt;ref name="Obituaries"&gt;{{cite news | last = Rayner | first = Claire | title = News: Obituaries: Alex Comfort | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date = 28 March 2000 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/mar/28/guardianobituaries | accessdate = 23 August 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080918054049/http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2000/mar/28/guardianobituaries| archivedate= 18 September 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For discussions of Comfort's political views, see ''[[Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism]]'' (1992) by [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]], and ''[[Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow]]'' (2006) by [[David Goodway]].&lt;/ref&gt; During World War Two, Comfort wrote a letter to the ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' magazine (2 April 1943) denouncing the Allied bombing of civilians:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The bombardment of Europe is not the work of soldiers nor of responsible statesmen. It is the work of bloodthirsty fools.... Night after night those Europeans who risk their liberty to listen can hear the emetic threatenings and boastings of bloody-minded and reactionary civilians. They contrast the alacrity and satisfaction which attend each contemptible operation with the subterfuge and sloth which we have displayed in such tasks of constructive policy as the admission to sanctuary of the Jewish refugees.&lt;ref name="dg" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a letter to ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'', Comfort claimed that a Nazi victory over the United Kingdom would lead to a literary renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/pacifism/english/e_patw&lt;/ref&gt; He was an active member of the [[Peace Pledge Union]]&amp;nbsp;(PPU) and [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and a [[conscientious objector]] in [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. In 1951 Comfort was a signatory of the [[Authors' World Peace Appeal]], but later resigned from its committee, claiming the AWPA had become dominated by Soviet sympathisers.&lt;ref&gt;Carissa Honeywell, ''A British Anarchist Tradition: Herbert Read, Alex Comfort and Colin Ward'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2011 {{ISBN|1441190171}} (p. 112).&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the decade he actively endorsed both the [[Direct Action Committee against Nuclear War]], 1957, and the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]], 1960. Comfort was imprisoned for a month, with [[Bertrand Russell]] and other leading members of the Committee of 100, for refusing to be bound not to continue organising the Parliament Square/Trafalgar Square protest of 17 September 1961.

Among the publications by Comfort concerning anarchism is ''Peace and Disobedience'' (1946), one of many pamphlets he wrote for ''[[Peace News]]'' and PPU, and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100522053611/http://alexcomfort.com/Authority.html ''Authority and Delinquency in the Modern State''] (1950).&lt;ref name="Obituaries"/&gt; He exchanged public correspondence with [[George Orwell]] defending pacifism in the open letter/poem, "Letter to an American Visitor", under the pseudonym "Obadiah Hornbrooke".&lt;ref name="obadiah"&gt;''Complete Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'' volume II, pg. 294–303&lt;/ref&gt;

Comfort's book ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' (1972) earned him worldwide fame and $3&amp;nbsp;million. But he was unhappy to become known as "Dr.&amp;nbsp;Sex" and to have his other works given so little attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Martin | first = Douglas | title = Alex Comfort, 80, Dies; a Multifaceted Man Best Known for Writing 'The Joy of Sex' | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | date = 20 March 2000 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E4DD173CF93AA15750C0A9669C8B63 | accessdate = 23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comfort devoted much of the 1950s and 1960s studying the biology of ageing ([[Gerontology#Biogerontology|biogerontology]]) and popularised the subject. He could be termed an early biomedical gerontologist ([[life extension]]ist) on the basis of his opinion that science could extend human lifespan. During 1969 he suggested that [[life expectancy]] (not simply [[maximum life span]]) could be extended to 120 years of age within the next 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="Obituaries"/&gt; Although Comfort believed that ageing could be postponed, he did not believe that it could be eliminated, and he did not write about [[Rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Gerontology A Good Age by Alex Comfort | publisher = Trivia-Library.com  | date = 1975–1981 | url = http://www.trivia-library.com/b/gerontology-a-good-age-by-alex-comfort.htm | accessdate = 23 August 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080720020906/http://www.trivia-library.com/b/gerontology-a-good-age-by-alex-comfort.htm| archivedate= 20 July 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Comfort's final letters was to ''[[The Guardian]]'' during 1989, protesting against the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] government's introduction of the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].&lt;ref name="dg" /&gt;

==Personal life==
''The Joy of Sex'' made Comfort known internationally as "Dr.&amp;nbsp;Sex" and soon thereafter he and his wife of thirty years divorced. A few months later, during 1973, Comfort married his mistress (and ex-wife's best friend) Jane Henderson, with whom he had been having an affair for more than a decade. (The illustrations in ''The Joy of Sex'' were based on [[Instant film|Polaroids]] that Comfort and Henderson had taken and given to the publisher.) The [[Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions]], a liberal [[think tank|research institute]], offered Comfort a job, and so, during 1973, the couple relocated to [[Santa Barbara, California]], where it was located.&lt;ref name=newyorker /&gt;

They frequented the [[Sandstone Retreat]], a [[clothing-optional community]] in California espousing "open sexuality", or swinging. In his 1981 nonfiction publication concerning sexuality in America, ''[[Thy Neighbor's Wife]]'', [[Gay Talese]] noted, "Often the nude biologist Dr.&amp;nbsp;Alex Comfort, brandishing a cigar, traipsed through the room between the prone bodies with the professional air of a [[lepidopterist]] strolling through the fields waving a butterfly net".&lt;ref name=newyorker /&gt;

Jane Henderson, however, eventually became tired of the "open love" community and Comfort became involved in lawsuits with his employer concerning a claimed [[breach of contract]]. During 1985, the couple returned to England, where they lived the remainder of their lives in [[Kent]]. During 1991, Comfort suffered a severe [[cerebral haemorrhage]], after which his son from his first marriage acted as his caretaker and business manager. His second wife Jane Henderson died soon after the haemorrhage. He died on 26 March 2000; he was eighty years old.&lt;ref name=newyorker /&gt;

}}'''Almigdad Mojalli''' (ca. 1981 – 17 January 2016) was a [[Yemen]]i [[freelance journalist]] working for the [[United States]] media service [[Voice of America]]. On 17 January 2016 Mojalli was killed by a Saudi airstrike in a village near [[Sana'a]] while attempting to report on the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]].&lt;ref name=nytimes2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/01/22/world/middleeast/ap-ml-yemen-airstrikes.html|title=Dozens Killed in Yemen Airstrikes by Saudi-Led Coalition|date=22 January 2016|work=AP|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal ==
Almigdad Mojalli was born 1981 in Sana'a, Yemen. Mojalli was a student at [[Sana'a University]] from 2002 to 2005, at which time he graduated with a bachelor's degree of English Language.&lt;ref name=rorypecktrust&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rorypecktrust.org/rpt-live/January-2016-(1)/Remembering-Almigdad-Mojalli,-RPT-friend-and-bene|title=Remembering Almigdad Mojalli|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was married at the time of his death and has a son, Abdelaziz.&lt;ref name="voanews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/airstrike-in-yemen-kills-freelance-journalist-working-for-voa/3149762.html|title=Airstrike in Yemen Kills Freelance Journalist Working for VOA|work=VOA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Mojalli was a freelance journalist who wrote for many different companies, such as Voice of America radio, ''The Daily Telegraph'' ([[United Kingdom]]) newspaper, [[Al Jazeera]] ([[Qatar]]) and the [[IRIN]] news agency for the [[United Nations]]. Since October 2006, Mojalli had been working for Voice of America.&lt;ref name=voanews /&gt; Before his death, he had been reporting mainly about the humanitarian crisis of the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)'s]] victims and the impact of the intervention on Yemen.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/18/world/middleeast/covering-war-at-home-costs-a-yemeni-his-life.html|title=Covering War at Home Costs a Yemeni His Life|date=18 January 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cpjarticle&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/2016/01/freelance-journalist-killed-by-saudi-coalition-air.php|title=Freelance journalist killed by Saudi coalition airstrike in Yemen|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}Almigdad Mojalli received threats from Houthi government officials before his death in 2016.&lt;ref name=cpjarticle /&gt; He was threatened with confinement several times and was accused of being a spy for [[Saudi Arabia]] and the United States. He also avoided arrest and kidnap numerous times while on assignments.&lt;ref name=rorypecktrust /&gt;

Almigdad Mojalli was killed by a Saudi airstrike Sunday morning, January 17, 2016 in Hamam Jarif, Yemen. While on an assignment for Voice of America, the Saudi-led coalition conducted an air raid that struck Mojalli, while he was on assignment to find and interview witnesses of an airstrike that had killed 15 civilians the week before outside Sana'a.&lt;ref name=voanews /&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; Mojalli and his colleagues, who were traveling by car, arrived in the eastern village Hamam Jarif, they observed coalition jets circling above them.&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35348018|title=Yemen crisis: Deadly air strike on Sanaa police HQ|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airstrike injured Mojalli, causing severe wounds to his stomach, neck and face. While Mojalli was covered in blood, his colleagues Bahir Hameed and the driver Al-Sumaei bandaged him by wrapping a scarf around his injuries.&lt;ref name=albawaba1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albawaba.com/news/yemeni-journalist-killed-saudi-led-airstrike-witness-794262|title=Yemeni journalist killed in Saudi-led airstrike: witness|work=Al Bawaba}}&lt;/ref&gt; His colleagues then carried him to the car and laid him in the back.&lt;ref name=cpjarticle /&gt; Al-Sumaei, the driver, asked Hameed to drive as he was also injured. Hammed couldn't drive for more than 10 meters because he was in shock and stopped. Sumaei took over and after 10 minutes they arrived at a small clinic, which was poorly stocked and unable to treat Mojalli's wounds. The man in the clinic told them to go to the town of Belad al-Roos.&lt;ref name=theintercept&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/02/02/bandage-me-quickly-the-death-of-a-journalist-in-yemen/|title="Bandage Me Quickly!"

== Context ==
Yemen has been in a [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|civil war]] since 2015 in which dozens of schools and hospitals have been bombed by deadly airstrikes.&lt;ref name=ifex&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ifex.org/yemen/2016/01/18/killed_in_indiscriminate_airstrike/|title=Leading Yemeni journalist Almigdad Mojalli killed in Saudi-led airstrike|work=IFEX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intervention was initiated after the [[Houthi rebellion]], which is a [[Shia Islam]] group led by [[Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi]], and the takeover of Sana'a. The Houthis are known to be sponsored by [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=cpj&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/killed/2016/almigdad-mojalli.php|title=Almigdad Mojalli|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|date=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia began its air raids on the country in support of Hadi's government.&lt;ref name=un&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53049#.VqTNBCorJaQ|title=United Nations News Centre|date=20 January 2016|work=UN News Service Section}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacks started hitting civilian targets. Several civilians were killed by Saudi strikes while sleeping in their homes and the media has been silent on these attacks.&lt;ref name=ifj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifj.org/nc/news-single-view/backpid/1/article/yemen-journalist-killed-in-an-air-raid-by-the-saudi-led-coalition/|title=Yemen: journalist killed in an air raid by the Saudi-led coalition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newsonnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsonnews.com/story/190116-2103|title=VOA Honour Freelance Journalist Killed in Yemen|author=NewsOnRadio|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 8,100 civilians have been wounded and killed since the start of this war in early 2015.&lt;ref name=cnn2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/25/world/yemen-judge-killed-airstrike/|title=Airstrikes in Yemen|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=CNN|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
Almigdad Mojalli wrote humanitarian stories because he did not believe in fighting.&lt;ref name=voanews /&gt;&lt;ref name=washingtonpost&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2016/01/20/voa-journalist-killed-in-yemen/|title=VOA journalist killed in Yemen|author=Joe Davidson|date=20 January 2016|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; His stories often focused on international events and bringing awareness to the poverty, gender inequality and challenges.&lt;ref name=aljazeera&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/witness/2009/09/20099715835576637.html|title=The peacemaker|author=Mike Healy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yemenpeaceproject&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yemenpeaceproject.org/blogpost/remembrance/almigdad/|title=Almigdad Mojalli, 1980-2016|author=The Yemen Peace Project|work=The Yemen Peace Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 5,600 people have been reported killed in Yemen's conflict and over 26,000 have been injured. There have been urges toward the Government to bring an end to this conflict. There are greater urges to offer better protection to international aid workers, civilians and journalists.&lt;ref name="parliament"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2015-16/994|title=Early day motion 994|work=UK Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
[[Irina Bokova]], director-general of [[UNESCO]], said "I call on all parties to make sure that journalists are bale to carry out their work in the safest possible conditions, in keeping with the Geneva Conventions and UN Security Council resolution 2222, which was adopted last year to improve the safety of journalists in conflict situations."&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.unesco.org/news/director-general-deplores-death-journalist-almigdad-mojalli-yemen|title=Director-General deplores death of journalist Almigdad Mojalli in Yemen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack was condemned by [[Reporters Without Borders]], which released the following statement: "RSF reminds all the parties to the armed conflict in Yemen that they are required to respect journalists by [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] Resolution 2222, adopted in 2015, and by the [[Geneva Conventions]]."&lt;ref name=ifex /&gt;

A spokesperson for the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] said, "Almigdad Mojalli's terrible death highlights the extreme risks reporters face as they cover the fighting in Yemen. All Parties to this conflict must take every possible step to protect journalists trying to of their job."&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt;

BBG CEO and Director John Lansing said, "Almigdad Mojalli was a committed and talented journalist who made the ultimate sacrifice to report on the difficult, but important, stories coming out of Yemen."&lt;ref name=bbg2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbg.gov/blog/2016/01/18/bbg-voa-honor-freelance-journalist-killed-in-yemen/|title=BBG, VOA Honor Freelance Journalist Killed in Yemen|work=BBG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VOA Director Kelu Chao said, "Truth telling on the ground in the midst of conflict is a serious endeavor. Reporting on the tragic nature of war requires fortitude and a willingness to take risks. Mr. Mojalli was a fine journalist and an example of us all. We mourn the loss of this courageous man."&lt;ref name="parliament"/&gt;

{{Ancient Egyptian religion}}
The '''offering formula''', also known under transliterated forms of its [[incipit]] as the '''''ḥtp-ḏỉ-nsw''''' or '''''ḥtp-ḏj-nswt'' formula''' was a conventional dedicatory formula found on ancient Egyptian funerary objects, believed to allow the deceased to partake in offerings presented to the major deities in the name of the king, or in offerings presented directly to the deceased by family members.&lt;ref name=Collier&gt;{{cite book | author= Collier M | title = [[How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs]] | location = London, England | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1998 | pages = 35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JPAllen&gt;{{cite book | author= Allen, James P. | authorlink= James Peter Allen | title = Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs | edition= revised second | location = Cambridge, UK | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2010 | pages = 365–367}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is among the most common of all Middle Egyptian texts.&lt;ref name=JPAllen/&gt;

Its incipit [[wikt:ḥtp-ḏj-nswt|ḥtp-ḏj-nswt]] "an offering given by the king" is followed by the name of a deity and a list of offerings given. The offering formula is usually found carved or painted onto funerary stelae, [[false door]]s, coffins, and sometimes other funerary objects. Each person had their own name and titles put into the formula. The offering formula was not a royal prerogative like some of the other religious texts such as the [[Litany of Re]], and was used by anyone who could afford to have one made.&lt;ref name=Collier/&gt;

==Text==
All ancient Egyptian offering formulas share the same basic structure, but there is a great deal of variety in which deities and offerings are mentioned, and which epithets and titles are used. Below is an example of a typical offering formula:

::&lt;hiero&gt;M23 t:R4 X8 Q1 D4 nb R11 w O49:t Z1 nTr aA nb U23 b N26:O49&lt;/hiero&gt;
::&lt;hiero&gt;D37:f O3 F1:H1 V6 S27 x:t nb:t nfr:t wab:t S34:t nTr i m&lt;/hiero&gt;
::&lt;hiero&gt; n:D28:n i F39:x i i F12 s r:t:z:n A1 Aa11:P8 &lt;/hiero&gt;

::''ḥtp dỉ nsw wsỉr nb ḏdw, nṯr ꜥꜣ, nb ꜣbḏw''
::''dỉ=f prt-ḫrw t ḥnqt, kꜣw ꜣpdw, šs mnḥt ḫt nbt nfrt wꜥbt ꜥnḫt nṯr ỉm'' 
::''n kꜣ n ỉmꜣḫy s-n-wsrt, mꜣꜥ-ḫrw''

::"An offering given by the king (to) Osiris, the lord of [[Busiris (Lower Egypt)|Busiris]], the great god, the lord of [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]."
::"That he may give an invocation offering of bread, beer, oxen, birds, alabaster, clothing, and every good and pure thing upon which a god lives."
::"For the [[Egyptian soul|ka]] of the revered [[Sesostris|Senwosret]], True of Voice."

The offering formula always begins with the phrase:
::&lt;hiero&gt;M23 t:R4 X8&lt;/hiero&gt; 
::''ḥtp dỉ nsw'' 
This phrase was in use since [[Old Egyptian]], and literally means "an offering given by the king." This dedication does not indicate that the gift was personally given by the [[Pharaoh|king]]; rather, it identifies the funerary offering as being royally authorized.&lt;ref name=JPAllen/&gt; Because the king was seen as an intermediary between the people of Egypt and the gods, the offering was made in his name.&lt;ref name=Collier/&gt;

Next the formula names a god of the dead and several of his epithets. Usually the god is [[Osiris]], [[Anubis]], or (rarely) [[Geb]], [[Wepwawet]], or another deity. This part of the formula identifies the local funerary establishment that actually provided the offering; the offering is seen as being under the auspices of that establishment’s patron deity.&lt;ref name=JPAllen/&gt; The following phrase is a typical invocation of Osiris:
::&lt;hiero&gt;Q1 D4 nb R11 w O49:t Z1 nTr aA nb U23 b N26:O49&lt;/hiero&gt;
::''wsỉr nb ḏdw, nṯr ꜥꜣ, nb ꜣbḏw''
which means "Osiris, the lord of [[Busiris (Lower Egypt)|Busiris]], the great god, the lord of [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]." There was apparently no set rule about what epithets were used; however, "Lord of Busiris," "Great God," and "Lord of Abydos" were very common. Also frequent were:
::&lt;hiero&gt;nb H6 nb G21 H H N5&lt;/hiero&gt;
::''[[nb (hieroglyph)|nb]] ỉmnt [[nb (hieroglyph)|nb]] nḥḥ''
meaning "[[basket (hieroglyph)|Lord]] of the West, [[basket (hieroglyph)|Lord]] of Eternity"&lt;br&gt;
Anubis is seen less frequently than Osiris, and usually read,
::&lt;hiero&gt;E15:R4 W17 t nTr O21 D1 N26:f&lt;/hiero&gt;
::''ỉnpw, ḫnty sḥ nṯr tpy ḏw=f''
meaning "Anubis, he who is in front of his divine booth, he who is on his mountain."

After the list of deities and their titles, the formula proceeds with a list of the ''[[wikt:prt-ḫrw|prt-ḫrw]]'', or "invocation offerings," of which the spirit of the deceased is called to partake.&lt;ref name=JPAllen/&gt; The list is always preceded by the phrase:
::&lt;hiero&gt;D37:f O3&lt;/hiero&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;hiero&gt;X8 s:n O3&lt;/hiero&gt;
::''dỉ=f prt-ḫrw''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''dỉ=sn prt-ḫrw''
which means "He (or they, in the second example) give(s) invocation offerings." After this phrase, the list of offerings follows; for example:
::&lt;hiero&gt;D37:f O3 F1:H1 V6 S27 x:t nb:t nfr:t wab:t S34:t nTr i m&lt;/hiero&gt;
::''dỉ=f prt-ḫrw t ḥnqt, kꜣw ꜣpdw, šs mnḥt ḫt nbt nfrt wꜥbt ꜥnḫt nṯr ỉm'' 
meaning "He gives invocation offerings of bread, beer, oxen, birds, alabaster, clothing, and every good and pure thing upon which a god lives." Sometimes the text at the end of the list is replaced with the phrase:
::&lt;hiero&gt;x:t nb:t nfr:t wab:t D37:t:D37 p*t:N1 T14 G1 N16:N21*Z1 W25 n:n:t V28 D36:p:N36 S34:t nTr i m&lt;/hiero&gt;
::''ḫt nbt nfrt wꜥbt ddt pt qmꜣ(t) tꜣ ỉnnt ḥꜥp(ỉ) ꜥnḫt nṯr ỉm''
Meaning "Every good and pure thing that the [[sky (hieroglyph)|sky]] gives, the earth creates, the inundation brings, on which the god lives."&lt;ref name=JPAllen/&gt; 

The last part of the offering formula lists the name and titles of the recipient of the invocation offerings. For example:
::&lt;hiero&gt; n:D28:n i F39:x i i F12 s r:t:z:n A1 Aa11:P8 &lt;/hiero&gt;
::''n kꜣ n ỉmꜣḫy s-n-wsrt, mꜣꜥ-ḫrw'' 
which means "for the [[Egyptian soul|ka]] of the revered [[Sesostris|Senwosret]], True of Voice."

'''Archduchess Maria Anna Eleanor Wilhelmina Josepha of Austria''' (18 September 1718 in [[Vienna]] – 16 December 1744 in [[Brussels]]) was an Archduchess of Austria and a Princess of [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], the younger sister of Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], and a Governor of the Austrian Netherlands. 

== Life ==
Maria Anna was born at the [[Hofburg Imperial Palace]] in [[Vienna]]. Her birth was not well received by her father. She and her sister [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] were the only children of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] to survive into adulthood. The two sisters were raised in the [[Kaiserhof]] in [[Vienna]]. During her youth she met her future brother in law, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen of Lorraine]] and his younger brother [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine|Charles Alexander of Lorraine]]. The two princes were staying in Austria having a good education; their mother [[Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans]] was in France.

The flowers which she carries in the uplifted folds of her dress represent her fertility and expectations to bear children in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Allison Mary: ''Widowhood and visual culture in early modern Europe, Issue 7630'' Ashgate Publishing Ltd. 2003 {{ISBN|0-7546-0731-3}}, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1725, negotiations with the Queen of Spain, [[Elisabeth Farnese]] had Maria Anna as a possible wife of [[Philip, Duke of Parma]], who was just five. This match was supposed to smooth over relations with Spain. An alliance of Spain and Austria was signed on 30 April 1725 and thus guaranteed the Pragmatic Sanction of the Habsburgs [allowing Maria Theresa right of her father's lands being his eldest daughter], which was first declared in 1713. Based on the terms of the treaty, the Austrian Empire relinquished all claims to the Spanish throne. It also agreed that Spain would invade Gibraltar with the help of the Austrians. Despite this, the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1727)|Anglo-Spanish War]] stopped the ambitions of Elisabeth of Parma and with the signing of the Treaty of Seville (9 November 1729) saw the abandonment of the Austro-Spanish marriage plans.

She fell in love with [[Charles Alexander of Lorraine]], the younger brother of Maria Theresa's husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen]]. There was considerable resistance to their marriage, not least the wish of her father for a politically more important son-in-law.

Maria Anna's husband-to-be was a [[cousin|half-second-cousin-once-removed]], being a third generation descendant of [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor]], through two of Ferdinand III's children, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his half-sister [[Eleonora Maria of Austria]].

=== Governor of the Austrian Netherlands ===
It was only after their father's death that Elizabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel gave the approval for the marriage, which was concluded in St Augustine's Church (''Augustinerkirche'') in Vienna on 7 January 1744. The marriage was recognised by [[Letters Patent]] signed on 8 January.

Weeks after the marriage, the couple were appointed governors of the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Austrian Netherlands]] in succession of their aunt [[Archduchess Maria Elisabeth of Austria (1680–1741)|Archduchess Maria Elisabeth of Austria]], who had died in 1741. The couple left Vienna on 3 February and arrived in [[Westwezel]], a town in the Austrian Netherlands, on 24 March where they were met by Karl Ferdinand von Königsegg-Erps. Karl Ferdinand was a member of the Supreme council of the Netherlands and had to receive Prince Charles and Maria Anna due to etiquette. Their arrival was greeted with much celebration. A ceremony had been organised for their arrival; this included a [[Te Deum]] and a collection of balls and banquets.

The couple only had two months of time together in the Netherlands, as Charles had to leave to participate in the [[War of the Austrian Succession|war against Prussia]], while Maria Anna, pregnant with their first child, remained in Brussels. Charles left officially on 4 May. 

While alone in Brussels, Maria Anna was assisted in governing by the Austrian statesman [[Count Wenzel Anton Kaunitz-Rietberg]].

=== Death ===
In December 1744 Maria Anna went into labour and gave birth to a stillborn child; she never recovered and died on 16 December 1744 due to the difficult childbirth. Both were buried in the [[Imperial Crypt, Vienna|Imperial Crypt]] in [[Vienna]]. Charles Alexander never remarried.

Charles would remain the Governor until his death in 1780. He was a very popular governor and died in [[Brussels]] like his wife.

'''Artificial creation''' is a field of research that studies the primary synthesis of complex lifelike structures from primordial lifeless origins.  

The field bears some similarity to [[artificial life]], but unlike artificial life, artificial creation focuses on the primary emergence of complex structures and processes of abiogenesis.  Artificial creation does not rely exclusively on the application of [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithms]] to optimize artificial creatures or grow synthetic life forms.  Artificial creation instead studies systems of rules of interaction, initial conditions and  primordial building blocks that can generate complex lifelike structures, based exclusively on repeated application of rules of interaction.
   
An essential difference that distinguishes artificial creation from other related fields is that no explicit [[fitness function]] is used to select for fit structures. Structures exist based only on their ability to persist as entities that do not violate the system's rules of interaction. Artificial creation studies the way in which complex [[emergent properties]] can arise to form a [[self-organizing system]].

==Origins==

Although concepts and elements of artificial creation are represented to some degree in many areas, the field itself is less than a decade old. There are models of self-organizing systems that produce emergent properties in [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[engineering]] and other fields. Artificial creation differs from these in that it focuses on underlying properties of systems that can generate the endless environmentally interactive complexity of living systems.  

One of the primary impetuses for the exploration of artificial creation comes from the realization in the [[artificial life]] and [[evolutionary computing]] fields that some basic assumptions common in these fields represent subtle mischaracterizations of natural [[evolution]].  These fall into two general classes: 1) there are fundamental problems with the use of [[fitness functions]] for the primary synthesis of complex systems, and 2)  the process of [[self-replication]] used in almost all artificial life research is not a fundamental property of [[self-organizing systems]].

==Issues==

The concept of a [[fitness function]] (or [[objective function]]) is central to [[artificial life]] systems. The [[fitness function]] is used to drive a given [[artificial evolution]] process to create [[synthetic organisms]] capable of performing a given task.  However, [[fitness functions]], even aggregate high-level ones, drive evolving systems to particular solutions and place a ceiling on innovation and complexity.  Natural [[evolution]] does not drive organisms toward particular solutions to problems.  There is no motive force for [[evolution]] in our universe beyond that of adherence to physical law.  This is a subtle point: when modern organisms are viewed in a local context it does appear that they are evolving to optimize particular abilities that will help them survive.  This is not the case in a global sense.  In fact, the pressure to optimize a given ability comes from the current state of a given population.  The only fundamental selective pressure is the ability of structures to adhere to physical law.  [[Stochastic]] events initiated the appearance of features that we might view as adaptive traits, and it is the local evolution of these traits that much of evolutionary theory is based upon.  

The universe maintains its own consistency.  However, when trying to model the universe, or create [[artificial organisms]] by mimicking natural evolution, the application of [[fitness functions]] that select for particular abilities force an unnatural bias onto the evolving organisms. 

In [[evolutionary biology]], it is well understood that all properties of organisms and [[ecosystems]] are [[emergent properties]] of fundamental physical law. The conceptual problems related to generations, offspring and populations that occur in [[artificial life]] systems stem from the fact that self-replication is itself an innovation of life on Earth.  The dynamics observed in modern self-replicating life forms on Earth are extremely complex [[emergent properties]] of the organisms themselves, not driving forces imposed by an external controlling entity.

'''Biosatellite 3''', also known as abbreviated '''Biosat 3''' and as '''Biosatellite D'''&lt;ref&gt;Antonín Vítek [https://www.lib.cas.cz/space.40/1957/INDEX1.HTM 1969-056A - Biosatellite 3]. ''Katalog družic'' {{cz}}. Retrieved 14 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;, was a third and last [[artificial satellite]] unmanned [[U.S.]] belonging to [[Biosatellite program]] for [[biological research]].

The intent had been to fly a 6&amp;nbsp;kg male pig-tailed [[monkey]] (''Macaca nemestrina'') named "Bonny" in [[Earth]]-orbit for 30 days. However, after only 8.8 days in orbit, the mission was terminated because of the subject's deteriorating health. High development costs were a strong incentive for maximising the scientific return from the mission. Because of this, the scientific goals had become exceedingly ambitious over time, and a great many measurements were conducted on the single research subject flown. Although the mission was highly successful from a technical standpoint, the science results were apparently compromised.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wade [https://web.archive.org/web/20100228031900/http://www.astronautix.com/details/bio31015.htm Biosatellite 3]. ''Encyclopedia Astronautica''. Retrieved 14 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bonny, dubbed an "astromonk" by the American press (as opposed to the chimpanzees from earlier American missions who were nicknamed "chimponauts") died on 8 July, one day after the biological capsule's successful recovery from the Pacific &lt;ref&gt; [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=djft3U1LymYC&amp;dat=19690708&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en "Astromonk Dies After Return"], ''Pittsburgh Press'', July 8, 1969, p1 &lt;/ref&gt;.  

Despite the seeming failure of the mission's scientific agenda, Biosatellite 3 was influential in shaping the life sciences flight experiment program, pointing to the need for centralised management, realistic goals and substantial pre-flight experiment verification testing. The mission objective was to investigate the effect of space flight on [[brain]] states, behavioural performance, cardiovascular status, fluid and [[electrolyte]] balance, and metabolic state.&lt;ref name="nssdc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/mission/miss.aspx?mis_index=56|title=Mission information:  Biosatellite III|work=[[NASA]]|accessdate=25 May 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biosophy''', meaning ''wisdom of life'', is a [[humanism|humanist]] movement heavily influenced by the [[17th-century philosophy|17th-century philosopher]] [[Baruch Spinoza]].  It is "the science and art of intelligent living based on the awareness and practice of spiritual values, ethical-social principles and character qualities essential to individual freedom and social harmony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biosophicalinstitute.tripod.com/objectives.htm |title=Objectives of Biosophy |publisher=Biosophicalinstitute.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stands in relation to [[biology]], which can be broadly described as the ''understanding of life''.

==History==
The term Biosophy was probably first used in 1806 by [[Ignaz Paul Vitalis Troxler]], a Swiss philosopher whose early works followed [[F. W. J. Schelling]]. It was later used by other philosophers like [[Peter Wessel Zapffe]] (1899–1990), who used [[biology]] as the foundation of his [[philosophy]]. Zapffe first set out his ideas in ''Den sidste Messias'' (en. ''[[The Last Messiah]]'') (1933). Later Zapffe gave a more systematic defence in his philosophical treatise ''[[Om det tragiske]]'' (en. ''[[On the tragic]]'') (1941).  The Biosophical Institute claims that Dr. [[Frederick Kettner]] (1886-1957) was the founder of biosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biosophicalinstitute.tripod.com/kettner.htm |title=Dr. Frederick Kettner |publisher=Biosophicalinstitute.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kettner was himself originally inspired by the [[organicism]] of [[Constantin Brunner]].

Contemporary 'biosophers' include [[Jong Bhak]], who defines Biosophy as a "new way of performing philosophy generated from scientific and biological awareness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biosophy.org/index.php/Main_Page |title=Main Page - Biosophy_org |publisher=Biosophy.org |date=2015-02-28 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhak developed his theory of Biosophy while studying at Cambridge university in 1995 and afterwards. The main difference of Bhak's biosophy from other philosophy is that his biosophy is a computable philosophy. It borrows [[Bertrand Russell|Russell's]] logicism and extends it to a computational set of ideas and knowledge. One ultimate aim of biosophy is to construct a logical thinking machine that can do philosophy for human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biosophy.org |title=Main Page - Biosophy_org |publisher=Biosophy.org |date=2015-02-28 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosophy Program==
The Biosophy Program was presented on the Internet by Anna Öhman &amp; Svenolov Lindgren in January 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/biosophy/ |title=BIOSOPHY [Lundsbergs skola, Sweden&amp;#93; |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026234617/http://geocities.com/biosophy/ |archivedate=October 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They noted that "the term biosophy was previously used by Zapffe (1941) in a literary context for the analysis of human social life based on philosophy of existence and biological facts. Such a narrow circumscription of biosophy is in our opinion no obstacle to widen the definition to encompass all systematic thinking on biological issues."

The Biosophy Program was intended to circumscribe and systemize biological studies in a philosophical framework to support teaching at courses on philosophy and courses on biology. The biosophical thinking is defined by Öhman &amp; Lindgren in five philosophical fields and discriminated from Næss’ ecosophy.

==Objectives==
* To create biosophical groups for character and peace education where the individual has opportunities of self-improvement.
* To encourage integration among individuals based on their mutual interest in a spiritual purpose in life.
* To network with other groups and organizations interested in character and peace education working cooperatively with them.
* To replace the blind acceptance of theological beliefs, [[superstition]]s and [[dogma]]s with the cultivation of spiritual intelligence as the basis for the Religion of Freedom and Friendship.
* To create a world-fellowship of [[peace]]-loving human beings who have overcome religious, national, racial and social [[prejudice]]s who can work creatively for the growth of democracy, spiritual personal growth and world peace.
* To work for the synthesis of religion, philosophy, science, education and art.
* To perpetuate and advance Dr. Frederick Kettner's principles and work for the development and cultivation of the character and peace nature in young people.
* To create a Peace Department in national governments headed by a Secretary of Peace, and to establish peace universities.
* To establish a world-fellowship of thinking human beings who can work creatively for the growth of spiritual [[democracy]] and world peace.
* To cooperate in the advancement of humanity from civilization to the age of soulization.

==History==
An evolution of the [[phytotron]], the development of the facility had its roots in the late 1950s as a campaign established by the [[Botanical Society of America]] in search of a national phytotron.&lt;ref name=munns&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Engineering_the_Environment.html?id=kdssDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=biotron|last1=Munns|first1=David P. D.|title=Engineering the Environment: Phytotrons and the Quest for Climate Control in the Cold War|date=2017-05-30|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=9780822982760|language=en|pages=196-224}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|196}} With additional funding and support by the [[National Science Foundation]] the Biotron was eventually envisioned as a combination facility that would allow both plant and animal tests to be conducted.

Plant physiologist [[Folke Skoog]] would be instrumental in bringing the Biotron to the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. A colleague of [[Frits Went]] at Caltech, Skoog oversaw the two proposals the university submitted to the Botanical Society in 1959.&lt;ref name=munns /&gt;{{rp|203}} The interdisciplinary nature and scope of the project quickly led it to becoming Madison's most expensive facility at around 4.2 million dollars.&lt;ref name=munns /&gt;{{rp|202}} It was up to Harold Senn, appointed director of the Biotron to concentrate on assembling funding, which he was able to accomplish by January 1963, with the [[Ford Foundation]] and [[National Institute of Health]] contributing to the project.&lt;ref name=munns /&gt;{{rp|210}}

The Biotron was officially dedicated on September 18, 1970 with many experiments under precise controlled environmental conditions already under study, such as a lizard in the Palm Springs desert or black-eyed peas growing in hot and humid Nigeria.&lt;ref name=times1970&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/19/archives/environment-center-dedicated-wisconsins-biotron-permits-research-in.html|title=Environment Center Dedicated|last=Wilford|first=John Noble|date=1970-09-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When finally completed in 1971, the Biotron contained over fifty rooms with many able to variate temperature from as low as -25C to as high as 50C with humidity adjustable anywhere from 1%-100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biotron manual for investigators|last=Senn|first=H.

Senn supposedly spent an additional $3,000 of the Biotron budget on increasing the computer's memory an extra 4 [[kilobytes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biotron|url=http://www.worldoftrons.com/blog/2017/2/22/biotron|website=World of Trons|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Biotron went through a period of decline in the 1980s, unlike other facilities it never closed. In 1986, the first experiments using [[LED]]s to grow plants were developed with [[NASA]] and tests were performed for the [[Galileo probe]] before its 1989 launch.&lt;ref name=isthmus&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://isthmus.com/news/news/uw-madison-biotron-climate-simulation/|title=Field stations in a box|last=Merfeld|first=Liz|date=March 2, 2016|work=Isthmus|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of its work in the 1990s partnered with NASA in the [[Controlled Ecological Life Support System]] (CELSS) and its goal in researching the viability of certain vegetables for space travel, in particular the [[potato]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/206266590/|title= Invention may lead to space salads|date=June 13, 1992|page=6|work=Iowa City Press-Citizen from Iowa City, Iowa|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="munns" /&gt;{{rp|224}} Study of animal hibernation were done by [[ESA]] for human space exploration.&lt;ref name=isthmus /&gt;

==Rooms==

'''Blue Zones''' are regions of the world where [[Dan Buettner]] claims people live much longer than average. The term first appeared in the November 2005 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine cover story "The Secrets of a Long Life" by Buettner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0511/feature1/|title=Longevity, The Secrets of Long Life - National Geographic Magazine|website=ngm.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified five areas where: [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] ([[Japan]]); [[Sardinia]] ([[Italy]]); [[Nicoya Peninsula|Nicoya]] ([[Costa Rica]]); [[Icaria]] ([[Greece]]) and among the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] in [[Loma Linda, California]]. He offers an explanation, based on data and first hand observations, as to why these populations live healthier and longer lives. The term "Blue Zones" is [[trademarked]] by Dan Buettner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=This Adventurer Discovered The Secrets To Long Life — And It Could Save Iowa $16 Billion By 2016 |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/dan-buettner-blue-zone-iowa-2012-8 |accessdate=5 November 2018 |work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept grew out of demographic work done by Gianni Pes and [[Michel Poulain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As the two men zeroed in on the cluster of villages with the highest longevity, they drew concentric blue circles on the map and began referring to the area inside the circle as the Blue Zone. Together with demographers Pes and [[Michel Poulain|Poulain]], Buettner broadened the term, applying it to validated longevity areas of Okinawa, Japan and among the Seventh-day Adventists in Loma Linda, California.  Buettner and [[Michel Poulain|Poulain]], under the aegis of National Geographic, then identified and validated longevity hotspots in Nicoya, Costa Rica and Icaria, Greece.

'''Body capacitance''' is the physical property of the [[human body]] that has it act as a [[capacitor]]. Like any other electrically-conductive object, a human body can store electric charge if insulated. The actual amount of capacitance varies with the surroundings; it would be low when standing on top of a pole with nothing nearby, but high when leaning against an insulated, but grounded large metal surface, such as a household refrigerator, or a metal wall in a factory.

Synthetic fabrics and friction can charge a human body to about 3 kV. &lt;!-- Hewlett-Packard Bench Briefs, decades ago --&gt; Low potentials may not have any notable effect, but some electronic devices can be damaged by modest voltages of 100 volts. Electronics factories are very careful to prevent people from becoming charged up. A whole branch of the electronics industry deals with preventing static charge build-up and protecting products against [[electrostatic discharge]].

Notably, a combination of footwear with some sole materials, low humidity, and a dry carpet ([[synthetic fiber]] in particular) can cause footsteps to charge a person's body capacitance to as much as a few tens of kilovolts with respect to the earth. The human and surroundings then constitute a highly charged capacitor. A close approach to any conductive object connected to earth (ground) can create a shock, even a visible spark.

Body capacitance was a significant nuisance when tuning the earliest radios; touching a tuning knob would couple the body capacitance into the tuning circuit, slightly changing its resonant frequency. However, body capacitance is very useful in the [[Theremin]], a musical instrument in which it causes slight frequency shifts of the instrument's internal oscillators. One of them changes pitch, and the other causes loudness (volume) to change smoothly between silence and full amount.

Capacitance of a human body in normal surroundings is typically in the tens to low hundreds of picofarads, which is small by typical electronic standards. While humans are much larger than typical electronic components, they are also mostly separated by significant distance from other conductive objects. Although the occasional static shock can be startling and even unpleasant, the amount of stored energy is relatively low, and won't harm a healthy person.
The Human Body Model for capacitance, as defined by the Electrostatic Discharge Association (ESDA) is a 100pF capacitor in series with a 1.5[[ohm|kΩ]] resistor&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.esda.org/assets/Uploads/documents/FundamentalsPart5.pdf ESDA Fundamentals, Part 5] Retrieved 18 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Touch sensors==
The body capacitance can be used to operate pushbutton switches, elevators, or faucets. Certain [[voltage tester]] probes rely on body capacitance. 
A capacitive touch sensor responds to close approach (but not force of touch) of a part of a human body, usually a fingertip. The capacitance between the device itself and the fingertip is sensed.  Capacitive [[touch screen]]s don't require applying any force to their surfaces, which makes them easier to use and design in some respects. Furthermore, because of body capacitance, people act as good [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]], and some small televisions use people to enhance reception. {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[File:2005-Draco-dussumieri.jpg|thumb|A ''[[Draco (genus)|Draco]]'' lizard showing [[List of camouflage methods|camouflage methods]] including background matching, [[disruptive coloration]], reduction of shadow, and cryptic behavior in [[Bandipur National Park]]]]

In [[ecology]], '''crypsis''' is the ability of an animal to avoid observation or detection by other animals. It may be a [[aggressive mimicry|predation strategy]] or an [[antipredator adaptation]]. Methods include [[camouflage]], [[nocturnality]], [[wiktionary:subterranean|subterranean]] lifestyle and [[Batesian mimicry|mimicry]]. Crypsis can involve visual, olfactory (with [[pheromone]]s), or auditory concealment. When it is visual, the term '''cryptic coloration''', effectively a synonym for animal camouflage,{{efn|[[Military camouflage]] has multiple purposes, including not only concealment but also [[esprit de corps]] and recognition of friend and foe.}} is sometimes used, but many different [[list of camouflage methods|methods of camouflage]] are employed by animals.

==Overview==
There is a strong [[evolution]]ary pressure for animals to blend into their environment or conceal their shape, for prey animals to avoid predators and for predators to be able to avoid detection by prey. Exceptions include large [[herbivore]]s without natural enemies, brilliantly-colored birds that rely on flight to escape predators, and [[venomous]] or otherwise powerfully armed animals with [[aposematism|warning coloration]]. Cryptic animals include the [[tawny frogmouth]] (feather patterning resembles bark), the [[tuatara]] (hides in burrows all day; nocturnal), some [[jellyfish]] (transparent), the [[leafy sea dragon]], and the [[flounder]] (covers itself in sediment).

==Methods==
{{further information|List of camouflage methods}}

Methods of crypsis include (visual) camouflage, [[nocturnality]], and subterranean lifestyle. Camouflage can be achieved by a [[List of camouflage methods|wide variety of methods]], from [[disruptive coloration]] to [[transparency and translucency|transparency]] and some forms of [[mimicry]], even in habitats like the open sea where there is no background.&lt;ref name=zuanon&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zuanon |first=J.|author2=I.

===Visual===
{{main article|Camouflage}}
[[File:Jumping spider with prey.jpg|thumb|left|[[Camouflage]] allows animals like this [[Disruptive coloration|disruptively-patterned]] spider to capture prey more easily.]]

Many animals have evolved so that they visually resemble their surroundings by using any of the [[List of camouflage methods|many methods of natural camouflage]] that may match the color and texture of the surroundings (cryptic coloration) and/or break up the visual outline of the animal itself ([[disruptive coloration]]). Such animals may resemble rocks, sand, twigs, leaves, and even bird droppings ([[mimesis]]). Other methods including transparency and silvering are widely used [[underwater camouflage|by marine animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.morning-earth.org/graphic-E/Transf-Mimic.html |title=All Lives Transform:Adaptation- Mimicry |publisher=Morning-earth.org |date=February 14, 2007 |accessdate=January 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218081452/http://www.morning-earth.org/graphic-E/Transf-Mimic.html |archivedate=February 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some animals change color in changing environments seasonally, as in [[ermine]] and [[snowshoe hare]], or far more rapidly with [[chromatophore]]s in their integuments, as in [[chameleon]] and [[cephalopod]]s such as [[squid]].

[[Countershading]], the use of different colors on upper and lower surfaces in graduating tones from a light belly to a darker back, is common in the sea and on land. It is sometimes called Thayer's law, after the American artist [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]], who published a paper on the form in 1896 that explained that countershading paints out shadows to make solid objects appear flat, reversing the way that artists use paint to make flat paintings contain solid objects. Where the background is brighter than is possible even with white pigment, [[counter-illumination]] in marine animals, such as squid, can use light to match the background.

Some animals actively camouflage themselves with local materials. The [[decorator crab]]s attach plants, animals, small stones, or shell fragments to their carapaces to provide camouflage that matches the local environment. Some species preferentially select stinging animals such as [[sea anemones]] or noxious plants, benefiting from [[aposematism]] as well as or instead of crypsis.&lt;ref name=Hultgren&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/stachowicz/papers/Hultgren_Stachowicz_2011_BookChapter.pdf |title=Animal Camouflage |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |work=Camouflage in decorator crabs: Camouflage in decorator crabs |year=2011 |accessdate=December 13, 2012 |author=Hultgren, Kristin; Stachowicz, Jay in Stevens, M. and Merilaita, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olfactory===
Some animals, in both terrestrial and aquatic environments, appear to camouflage their odor, which might otherwise attract predators.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Conover. Predator-Prey Dynamics: the role of olfaction. CRC Press. 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-8493-9270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous arthropods, both insects and spiders, mimic ants, whether to avoid predation, to hunt ants, or (for example in the [[large blue butterfly]] caterpillar) to trick the ants into feeding them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Horace |last=Donisthorpe |title=Mimicry of Ants by Other Arthropods |volume=69 |issue =3–4 |pages=307–311 |date=January 1922 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2311.1922.tb02812.x/abstract |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.1922.tb02812.x |journal=Transactions of the Royal Entomological Society of London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pirate perch]] (''Aphredoderus sayanus'') may exhibit chemical crypsis, making them undetectable to frogs and insects colonizing ponds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=William J. |last1=Resetarits, Jr. |first2=Christopher A. |last2=Binckley |title=Is the pirate really a ghost?

===Auditory===
Some insects, notably some [[Noctuidae|Noctuid moths]], (such as the [[large yellow underwing]]), and some [[Arctiidae|tiger moths]], (such as the [[garden tiger]]), were originally theorized to defend themselves against predation by [[animal echolocation|echolocating]] bats, both by passively absorbing sound with soft, fur-like body coverings and by actively creating sounds to mimic echoes from other locations or objects.  The active strategy was described as a "phantom echo" that might therefore represent "auditory crypsis", with alternative theories about interfering with the bats' echolocation ("jamming").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Lee A. |last2=Surlykke |first2=Annemarie |title=How Some Insects Detect and Avoid Being Eaten by Bats: Tactics and Countertactics of Prey and Predator |journal=BioScience |volume=51 |issue=7 |pages=570–581 |date=July 2001 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0570:HSIDAA]2.0.CO;2 |url=http://www.life.umd.edu/faculty/wilkinson/honr278c/PDF/Miller01.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=10.1641/0006-3568%282001%29051%5B0555%3ARTTMWE%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |title=Full Access Return to the Magic Well: Echolocation Behavior of Bats and Responses of Insect Prey |author=Griffin, Donald R. |journal=BioScience |date=July 2001 |volume=51 |issue=7 |pages=555–556 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0555:RTTMWE]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Subsequent research has provided evidence for only two functions of moth sounds, neither of which involve "auditory crypsis". Tiger moth species appear to cluster into two distinct groups. One type produces sounds as acoustic [[aposematism]], warning the bats that the moths are unpalatable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hristov |first1=N. I. |last2=Conner |first2=W.E. |year=2005 |title=Sound strategy: acoustic aposematism in the bat–tiger moth arms race |journal=[[Naturwissenschaften]] |volume=92 |issue=|pages=164–169 |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0611-7 |pmid=15772807}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at least performing as acoustic [[mimicry|mimic]]s of unpalatable moths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barber |first=J. R. |last2=Conner |first2=W. E. |year=2007 |title=Acoustic mimicry in a predator–prey interaction |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=104 |pages=9331–9334 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0703627104 |pmid=17517637 |pmc=1890494}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other type uses sonar jamming. In the latter type of moth, detailed analyses failed to support a "phantom echo" mechanism underlying sonar jamming, but instead pointed towards echo interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corcoran |first1=A.J. |last2=Conner |first2=W.E. |last3=Barber |first3=J.R. |year=2010 |title=Anti-bat tiger moth sounds: Form and function | journal=Current Zoology |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=358–369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
There is often a self-perpetuating co-evolution, or [[evolutionary arms race]], between the perceptive abilities of animals attempting to detect the cryptic animal and the cryptic characteristics of the hiding species.&lt;ref name="FranksNoble2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Franks |first1=D. W. |last2=Noble |first2=J. |title=Warning signals and predator-prey coevolution |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=271 |issue=1550 |year=2004 |pages=1859–1865 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2795|pmc=1691800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different aspects of crypsis and sensory abilities may be more or less pronounced in given predator-prey species pairs.

Zoologists need special methods to study cryptic animals, including [[biotelemetry]] techniques such as [[tracking transmitter |radio tracking]], [[mark and recapture]], and enclosures or exclosures. Cryptic animals tend to be overlooked in studies of [[biodiversity]] and [[ecological extinction |ecological risk assessment]].

== Appearances ==
The very first Cyber-Scouts infiltrated the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] holding the [[Dart (Doctor Who)|Dart]], a rocket-powered fighter plane. At least two Scouts were identified in the comic, as they shared no distinguishable markings to that of the standard [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] also in the comic strip, [[Test Flight (Comic)|Test Flight]].

Later, when a squadron of [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] were [[Time Scoop|time scooped]] to the Death Zone on [[Gallifrey]] by [[Borusa]], Cyber-Scouts were present when Cyber-Bombs were placed around the [[TARDIS|Doctor's TARDIS]], in an effort to destroy it, in the television serial, [[The Five Doctors]]).

When the [[Sixth Doctor]] was caught up in the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] invasion of [[Earth]], Cyber-Scouts were shown painted metallic black for camouflage purposes in the [[London Underground]] sewers. Other Cyber-Scouts stationed in the [[Telos (Doctor Who)|Telos]] Cyber base took direct orders from the [[Cyber Controller]] and one Scout even made it into the [[TARDIS|Doctor's TARDIS]], when the Cyber Controller ambushed the [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]]. Other Scouts shown on Telos had again no distinguishable features and patrolled a set route, where some were attacked by Stratton and Bates in the television serial, [[Attack of the Cybermen|Attack Of The Cybermen]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cyber-Scout|last=|first=|date=|work=Tardis|access-date=2017-03-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Weapons ==
The first Cyber-Scouts of [[Mondas|Mondasian origin]] used their laser weapons, which were mounted onto their lower torso, as seen in the comic, [[Test Flight (Comic)|Test Flight]]).

In the Death Zone, Cyber-Scouts contributed in setting up the Cyber-Bombs to destroy the [[TARDIS|Doctor's TARDIS]] in the television serial, [[The Five Doctors]].

Later, the black painted Cyber-Scouts were armed with modified standard Cybermen weapons. These new weapons were bigger and more brightly coloured than their standard counterparts as seen in the television serial, [[Attack of the Cybermen|Attack Of The Cybermen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedoctorwhosite.co.uk/cybermen/cybermen-designs/11-attack-stealth-cyberman/|title=Stealth Cyberman - Cybermen Design and Hierarchy - The Doctor Who Site|website=www.thedoctorwhosite.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trivia ==
Cyber-Scouts originated from the [[TV Comic]] Annual 1970 strip '[[Test Flight (Doctor Who Comic)|Test Flight]],' in an adventure with the [[Second Doctor]], although this most likely did not have any impact on their appearance in the television series of [[Doctor Who]].  

The Cyber-Scouts found in [[Peter Davison|Peter Davison's]] era as the doctor were only distinguishable by the end credits mentioning who played the Cyber-Scouts.  Later, with [[Colin Baker]] as the doctor, the scouts were painted black, to be better distinguished from other [[Cyberman]] variants.  The Cyber-Scouts have never since made an appearance in the [[Doctor Who (series 1)|revival Doctor Who]] series.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Doctor_Who_-_In-Vision_079_-_Attack_of_the_Cybermen.PDF/Doctor%20Who%20-%20In-Vision%20079%20-%20Attack%20of%20the%20Cybermen_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Doctor Who In Vision 079 Attack Of The Cybermen"|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EN 15038''' is a [[quality standard]] developed especially for translation services providers. The EN 15038 standard ensures the consistent quality of the service. It requires regular audits by the certification body, and if any discrepancy is found, the certification shall be revoked. 

Many European translation companies have long felt the need for a reliable method of demonstrating the quality of the services they provide to their customers. Many sought [[ISO 9001]] certification as a demonstration of their commitment to quality management systems. However, as the ISO 9001 standard does not address the sort of translation-specific processes which many translators consider important in determining quality outcomes, this standard did not become widely accepted as a "guarantee of quality" in the industry. In 2006, a quality standard, specifically written for the translation industry, EN 15038, was published by CEN, the [[European Committee for Standardization]]. This was a serious attempt to provide certification of translation-specific quality management using independent, on-site audits by recognized certification bodies. This standard is gaining acceptance worldwide and the European Union has begun including it as a benchmark in its tender specifications.

==Background==
{{refimprove|date=September 2017}}
There have been a number of initiatives in Europe to create a universal quality standard that could benchmark the quality of the translation services and gain recognition through independent audit certification. This includes the Italian UNI 10574 Standard, the Austrian Önorm D 1200 and Önorm D 1201 Standards, the Dutch Taalmerk Standard and the German DIN 2345 Standard. In 1999 the EUATC (European Union of Associations of Translation Companies) saw the need to develop an industry specific quality standard. This initiative built on previous standards which had been established by some national associations of translation companies. This standard was the first European wide initiative. In 2003 the EUATC took this standard to the next level. They started working with CEN, the European standards body, in April 2003 with the aim of creating a certifiable quality process standard for translation. The public consultation period started in September 2004 and EN 15038 was published by May 2006. The EUATC is made up of national associations of translation companies throughout Europe and these national associations have been translating the standard into their own language and cooperating with their national standardisation bodies for publication and certification by independent third party auditors.

==Scope and definitions==
{{refimprove|date=September 2017}}
An area not covered by EN 15038 is the interpreting and service matrix. While the committee developing the standard recognised the value of including Interpretation within the scope of the standard, it was felt that managing interpreting quality would make developing the standard more difficult and it would extend the process.

Within the translation industry many words are used to describe different processes from one company to another. It is very important for anyone who intends to implement EN 15038 that they understand the meaning of the terms and definitions used in the standard. The standard also uses the terms ‘should’ and ‘shall’. When the word ‘shall’ is used, it is obligatory while ‘should’ is used for recommended.

The following are some of the terms which are defined in the standard:
* Translation Service Provider (TSP) – An organisation or person who supplies translation services. Also known as Language Service Provider (LSP).
* Added value service – Services which can be provided by a TSP in addition to translation.
* Competence – Demonstrated ability to apply knowledge and skill
* [[Language interpretation|Interpreting]] – Rendering of spoken information in the source language into the target language in spoken form.
* [[Translation]] – Rendering of written text in the source language into the target language.
* Translator – Person who translates.
* [[Source text]] – The original text. The text which is being translated.
* [[Target text]] – The translated text.
* [[Locale (computer software)|Locale]] – The linguistic, cultural, technical and geographical conventions of the target audience
* Revise – Examine a translation for its suitability for the agreed purpose, compare the source and target texts, and recommend corrective measures.
* Reviser – Person who revises.
* Review – Examine a target text for its suitability for the agreed purpose and respect for the conventions of the domain to which it belongs and recommend corrective measures.
* Reviewer – Person who reviews.
* [[Proofreading]] – Checking of proofs before publication.

==Main provisions==
The EN 15038 standard set out the: 
* Basic requirements for the human resources and process used in the provision of translation services
* Client – TSP relationship
* Procedures for translation services
The appendices provide additional information on project registration, technical pre-translation process, source text analysis, style guides and a non exhaustive list of added value services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lics-certification.org/downloads/04_CertScheme-LICS-EN15038v40_2011-09-01-EN.pdf LICS Certification Scheme EN 15038]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic requirements for the human resources and process used===

This section outlines the level of competence required by translators and others working on the project, the need for the right technology and communication equipment and the need for a documented quality management system.

===Client – TSP relation===

The standard sets out steps in the Client – TSP relationship. These include: 
* Enquiry &amp; feasibility
* Quotation
* Client – TSP agreement
* Handling of project related client information
* Project conclusion

===Procedures in translation services===
This section of the standard is divided in three subsections which deal with Project Management, Preparation and Translation. 

The standard states the TSP shall have documented procedures in place for handling translation projects, contact with the client, quality assurance and compliance with the client – TSP agreement. 

The sub-section on preparation deals with project registration, project assignment, technical resources, pre-translating process, source text analysis, terminology work and the style guide.

The standard specifies the following steps in the translation process: translation, checking, revision, review, proofreading and final verification.

===Added value services===
If a TSP offers any added value services, it should make every effort to apply the same level of quality to those services as to the services covered by the standard.

==National standards==
EN 15038 is published as the following national standards.
* PN-EN 15038 Poland
* BS EN 15038 Great Britain
* DIN EN 15038 Germany
* NF X50-670 France
* ÖNORM EN 15038 Austria
* SN EN 15038 Switzerland
* UNE-EN 15038 Spain
* SFS EN 15038 Finland
* UNI EN 15038 Italy
* EVS-EN 15038 Estonia
* MSZ EN 15038 Hungary
* SS-EN 15038:2006 Sweden
* SR-EN 15038 Romania
* BDS EN 15038 Bulgaria
* LST EN 15038 Lithuania

== EN 15038 and ISO 9001 ==
The EN 15038 standard not only introduces requirements for compliance with certain common procedures, as is the case with [[ISO 9000|ISO 9001]], but also [[wikt:monitor|monitor]]s the processes especially developed for the overall execution of the translation – from acceptance of the order to delivery. Also, EN 15038 certifies the translation service and not the process management, as is the case with ISO 9001.

{{hatnote|This article is on evolutionary acquisition of artificial neural topologies, not of natural ones.}}

'''Evolutionary acquisition of neural topologies''' ('''EANT'''/'''EANT2''') is an [[Evolutionary computation|evolutionary]] [[reinforcement learning]] method that evolves both the topology and weights of [[artificial neural network]]s. It is closely related to the works of Angeline et al.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J Angeline, Gregory M Saunders, and Jordan B Pollack. An evolutionary algorithm that constructs recurrent neural networks. IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 5:54–65, 1994. [http://demo.cs.brandeis.edu/papers/ieeenn.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and Stanley and Miikkulainen.&lt;ref&gt;NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies (NEAT) by Stanley and Miikkulainen, 2005 [http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ieeetec05.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the work of Angeline et al., the method uses a type of parametric mutation that comes from [[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]] and [[evolutionary programming]] (now using the most advanced form of the evolution strategies [[CMA-ES]] in EANT2), in which adaptive step sizes are used for optimizing the weights of the neural networks.  Similar to the work of Stanley ([[Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies|NEAT]]), the method starts with minimal structures which gain complexity along the evolution path.

==Contribution of EANT to neuroevolution==

Despite sharing these two properties, the method has the following important features which distinguish it from previous works in [[neuroevolution]].

It introduces a genetic encoding called '''common genetic encoding''' (CGE) that handles both direct and indirect encoding of neural networks within the same theoretical framework. The encoding has important properties that makes it suitable for evolving neural networks: 
# It is ''complete'' in that it is able to represent all types of valid phenotype networks.
# It is ''closed'', i.e. every valid genotype represents a valid phenotype. (Similarly, the encoding is ''closed under genetic operators'' such as structural mutation and crossover.)

These properties have been formally proven in.&lt;ref&gt;Yohannes Kassahun, Mark Edgington, Jan Hendrik Metzen, Gerald Sommer and Frank Kirchner.  Common Genetic Encoding for Both Direct and Indirect Encodings of Networks. In Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2007), London, UK, 1029–1036, 2007.[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1277162]&lt;/ref&gt;

For evolving the structure and weights of neural networks, an evolutionary process is used, where the ''exploration'' of structures is executed at a larger timescale (structural exploration), and the ''exploitation'' of existing structures is done at a smaller timescale (structural exploitation). In the structural exploration phase, new neural structures are developed by gradually adding new structures to an initially minimal network that is used as a starting point. In the structural exploitation phase, the weights of the currently available structures are optimized using an [[evolution strategy]].

==Performance==

EANT has been tested on some benchmark problems such as the double-pole balancing problem,&lt;ref&gt;Yohannes Kassahun and Gerald Sommer. Efficient reinforcement learning through evolutionary acquisition of neural topologies. In Proceedings of the 13th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks (ESANN 2005), pages 259–266, Bruges, Belgium, April 2005. {{cite web |url=http://www.ks.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~yk/ESANN2005EANT.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613093500/http://www.ks.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~yk/ESANN2005EANT.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[RoboCup]] keepaway benchmark.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Hendrik Metzen, Mark Edgington, Yohannes Kassahun and Frank Kirchner. Performance Evaluation of EANT in the RoboCup Keepaway Benchmark.

Moreover, a newer version of EANT, called EANT2, was tested on a visual servoing task and found to outperform [[Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies|NEAT]] and the traditional iterative [[Gauss–Newton algorithm|Gauss–Newton]] method.&lt;ref&gt;Nils T Siebel and Gerald Sommer.

A '''gametangium''' (plural: gametangia) is an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] or [[cell (biology)|cell]] in which [[gamete]]s are produced that is found in many multicellular [[protist]]s, [[algae]], [[Fungus|fungi]], and the [[gametophyte]]s of [[plant]]s. In contrast to [[gametogenesis]] in [[animal]]s, a gametangium is a [[haploid]] structure and formation of gametes does not involve [[meiosis]].

==Types of gametangia==
Depending on the type of gamete produced in a gametangium, several types can be distinguished.

===Female===
{{Main|Archegonium|Oogonium}}
Female gametangia are most commonly called '''[[Archegonium|archegonia]]'''. They produce [[egg cell]]s and are the sites for [[fertilization]]. Archegonia are common in algae and primitive plants as well as [[gymnosperm]]s. In [[flowering plant]]s, they are replaced by the [[embryo sac]] inside the [[ovule]].

===Male===
{{Main|Antheridium}}
The male gametangia are most commonly called '''[[Antheridium|antheridia]]'''. They produce [[Sperm|sperm cells]] that they release for fertilization. Antheridia producing non-motile sperm (spermatia) are called '''spermatangia'''. Some antheridia do not release their sperm. For example, the [[oomycete]] antheridium is a [[syncytium]] with many sperm [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] and fertilization occurs via fertilization tubes growing from the antheridium and making contact with the egg cells. Antheridia are common in the gametophytes in "lower" plants such as [[bryophyte]]s, [[fern]]s, [[cycad]]s and [[ginkgo]]. In "higher" plants such as [[conifer]]s and flowering plants, they are replaced by [[pollen grain]]s.

===Isogamous===
In [[isogamy]], the gametes look alike and cannot be classified into "male" or "female." For example, in [[zygomycete]]s, two gametangia (single [[multinucleate]] cells at the end of [[hypha]]e) form good contact with each other and fuse into a zygosporangium. Inside the zygosporangium, the nuclei from each of the original two gametangia pair up.

But because G before E in English is ambiguous (cf. "get" vs. "gel"), this leads to the common mispronunciation of {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɛ|ŋ|ɡ|ɪ|s|_|ˈ|k|ɑː|n}}, with both G's hard, which has led to an alternate spelling "Jenghis Khan" to try to prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;Pronunciation references:

He came to power by uniting many of the [[nomadic tribe]]s of [[Northeast Asia]]. After founding the Empire and being proclaimed "Genghis Khan", he launched the [[Mongol invasions]] that [[Mongol invasions and conquests|conquered]] most of [[Eurasia]]. Campaigns initiated in his lifetime include those against the [[Mongol conquest of the Qara Khitai|Qara Khitai]], [[Caucasus]], and [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|Khwarazmian]], [[Mongol conquest of Western Xia|Western Xia]] and [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|Jin]] dynasties. These campaigns were often accompanied by large-scale massacres of the civilian populations – especially in the Khwarazmian and Western Xia controlled lands. By the end of his life, the Mongol Empire occupied a substantial portion of [[Central Asia]] and [[Song dynasty|China]].

Before Genghis Khan died he assigned [[Ögedei Khan]] as his successor.

Many of these invasions repeated the earlier large-scale slaughters of local populations. As a result, Genghis Khan and his empire have a fearsome reputation in local histories.&lt;ref name="mongolia"&gt;Ian Jeffries (2007).

Beyond his military accomplishments, Genghis Khan also advanced the [[Mongol Empire]] in other ways. He decreed the adoption of the [[Old Uyghur alphabet|Uyghur script]] as the Mongol Empire's writing system. He also practiced [[meritocracy]] and encouraged [[religious tolerance]] in the Mongol Empire, and unified the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia. Present-day [[Mongols|Mongolians]] regard him as the founding father of [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=January 26, 2010 |url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/history/keller/mongols/empsub1.html |title=Genghis Khan |publisher=[[North Georgia College and State University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306053246/http://www.accd.edu/sac/history/keller/mongols/empsub1.html |archivedate=March 6, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genghis Khan was known for the brutality of his campaigns, and is considered by many to have been a [[Genocide|genocidal]] ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Richest Terror Army|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02rhxgr|publisher=BBC|author1=Peter Taylor|authorlink1=Peter Taylor (journalist)|date=May 27, 2015|quote=Beheadings and mass slaughter are the hallmark of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|IS]] – whole villages massacred, women cast into slavery. But this butchery is not random. It is callous and calculated, as former British intelligence officer [[Alastair Crooke]] points out: 'They in fact in some ways copy Genghis Khan and the Mongol approach to military conquest. You create an absolute fear deliberately in your enemies, and the first time you come to a village you kill everyone, the dogs, the cats, everything. Destroy it down to the ground.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he is also credited with bringing the [[Silk Road]] under one cohesive political environment. This brought relatively easy communication and trade between Northeast Asia, [[Muslim]] Southwest Asia, and Christian [[Europe#High and Late Middle Ages|Europe]], expanding the cultural horizons of all three areas.

== Early life ==

=== Lineage ===
{{Main|Family tree of Genghis Khan}}

[[File:Bust of Genghis Khan in Mongolia.jpg|thumb|A bust of Genghis Khan adorns a wall in the presidential palace in [[Ulaanbaatar]], [[Mongolia]].]]

Temüjin was related on his father's side to [[Khabul Khan]], [[Ambaghai]], and [[Hotula Khan]], who had headed the [[Khamag Mongol]] confederation and were descendants of [[Bodonchar Munkhag]] (c. 900). When the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] switched support from the Mongols to the [[Tatar confederation|Tatars]] in 1161, they destroyed [[Khabul Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Ratchnevsky|title=Genghis Khan: His Life and Legacy|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1991|isbn= 0-631-16785-4|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2017}}

Temüjin's father, [[Yesügei]] (leader of the [[Borjigin]] clan and nephew to [[Ambaghai]] and [[Hotula Khan]]), emerged as the head of the ruling Mongol clan. This position was contested by the rival [[Tayichiud|Tayichi'ud]] clan, who descended directly from [[Ambaghai]]. When the Tatars grew too powerful after 1161, the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] switched their support from the [[Tatars]] to the [[Keraites]].

=== Birth ===
[[File:onon.jpg|thumb|Autumn at the [[Onon River]], Mongolia, the region where Temüjin was born and grew up.]]

Little is known about Temüjin's early life, due to the lack of contemporary written records. The few sources that give insight into this period often contradict.

Temüjin's name was derived from the Mongol word ''temür'' meaning "of iron", while ''jin'' denotes agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/temujin|title=Meaning, origin and history of the name Temujin|last=Campbell|first=Mike|website=Behind the Name|access-date=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Temüjin'' thus means "[[blacksmith]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glasse|first1=Cyril|last2=Smith|first2=Huston|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|isbn=978-0-7591-0190-6|page=313|url=https://books.google.com/?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;pg=PA313&amp;lpg=PA313&amp;q=Tem%C3%BCjin%20means%20%22blacksmith%22.|date=January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temüjin was probably born in 1162&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;Rashid al-Din asserts that Genghis Khan was born in 1155, while the ''Yuanshi'' (元史, ''History of the [[Yuan dynasty]]'') records his year of birth as 1162.  According to Ratchnevsky, accepting a birth in 1155 would render Genghis Khan a father at the age of 30 and would imply that he personally commanded the expedition against the [[Tangut people|Tanguts]] at the age of 72.  Also, according to the ''[[Altan Tobci]],'' Genghis Khan's sister, Temülin, was nine years younger than he; but the ''Secret History'' relates that Temülin was an infant during the attack by the [[Merkits]], during which Genghis Khan would have been 18, had he been born in 1155.  Zhao Hong reports in his travelogue that the Mongols he questioned did not know and had never known their ages.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Delüün Boldog]], near the mountain [[Burkhan Khaldun]] and the rivers [[Onon River|Onon]] and [[Kherlen River|Kherlen]] in modern-day northern [[Mongolia]], close to the current capital [[Ulaanbaatar]]. ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'' reports that Temüjin was born grasping a blood clot in his fist, a traditional sign that he was destined to become a great leader. He was the second son of his father [[Yesügei]] who was a [[List of medieval Mongolian tribes and clans|Kiyad]] chief prominent in the [[Khamag Mongol]] confederation and an ally of [[Toghrul]] of the Keraite tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Morgan, David|title=The Mongols (Peoples of Europe)|year=1990|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temüjin was the first son of his mother [[Hoelun]]. According to the ''Secret History'', Temüjin was named after the [[Tatars|Tatar]] chief Temüjin-üge whom his father had just captured.

[[Yesugei|Yesukhei's]] clan was [[Borjigin]] (Боржигин), and [[Hoelun]] was from the [[Olkhunut]] sub-lineage of the [[Khongirad]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Guida Myrl Jackson-Laufer, Guida M.

Temüjin's noble background made it easier for him to solicit help from and eventually consolidate the other Mongol tribes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

=== Early life and family ===

[[File:Sukhbaatar Square - Ulan Bator-Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia - Улаанбаатар.jpg|thumb|Statue of Genghis Khan in Ulaanbaatar]]

Temüjin had three brothers [[Hasar]], [[Hachiun]], and [[Temüge]], one sister [[Temülen]], and two half-brothers [[Behter|Begter]] and [[Belgutei]].  Like many of the [[nomad]]s of Mongolia, Temüjin's early life was difficult. His father [[arranged marriage|arranged a marriage]] for him and delivered him at age nine to the family of his future wife [[Börte]] of the tribe [[Khongirad]]. Temüjin was to live there serving the head of the household Dai Setsen until the [[child marriage|marriageable age]] of 12.

While heading home, his father ran into the neighboring [[Tatars]], who had long been Mongol enemies, and they offered him food that poisoned him. Upon learning this, Temüjin returned home to claim his father's position as chief. But the tribe refused this and abandoned the family, leaving it without protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 29, 2018 |url=https://manof300.com/genghis-khan-redefine-your-circumstances |title=Redefining Your Circumstances: Genghis Khan’s Rise to Ruler of the World |publisher= Man of 300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next several years, the family lived in poverty, surviving mostly on wild fruits, ox [[Carrion|carcasses]], [[marmot]]s, and other small game killed by Temüjin and his brothers. Temujin's older half-brother [[Behter|Begter]] began to exercise power as the eldest male in the family and would eventually have the right to claim Hoelun (who was not his own mother) as wife.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weatherford|first1=Jack|title=Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5HCaqYbD5t0C&amp;lpg=PR3&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20Making%20of%20the%20Modern%20World|accessdate=December 16, 2014|isbn=978-0-307-23781-1|date=March 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temujin's resentment erupted during one hunting excursion when Temüjin and his brother [[Qasar|Khasar]] killed [[Behter|Begter]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt;

In a raid around 1177, Temujin was captured by his father's former allies, the [[Tayichi'ud]], and enslaved, reportedly with a [[cangue]] (a sort of portable stocks). With the help of a sympathetic guard, he escaped from the [[Yurt|ger]] (yurt) at night by hiding in a river crevice.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The escape earned Temüjin a reputation. Soon, [[Jelme]] and [[Bo'orchu]] joined forces with him. They and the guard's son [[Chilaun]] eventually became generals of Genghis Khan.

At this time, none of the tribal [[confederation]]s of Mongolia were united politically, and arranged marriages were often used to solidify temporary alliances. Temüjin grew up observing the tough political climate, which included [[Endemic warfare|tribal warfare]], [[theft|thievery]], [[Raid (military)|raids]], corruption, and revenge between confederations, compounded by interference from abroad such as from China to the south. Temüjin's mother Hoelun taught him many lessons, especially the need for strong [[military alliance|alliances]] to ensure stability in Mongolia.

==== Wives and children ====
As previously arranged by his father, Temüjin married [[Börte]] of the [[Onggirat]] tribe when he was around 16 in order to cement alliances between their two tribes. Soon after the marriage, Börte was kidnapped by the [[Merkit]]s and reportedly given away as a wife. Temüjin rescued her with the help of his friend and future rival, [[Jamukha]], and his protector, [[Toghrul]] of the [[Keraites|Keraite]] tribe. She gave birth to a son, [[Jochi]] (1185–1226), nine months later, clouding the issue of his parentage. Despite speculation over Jochi, Börte would be Temüjin's only empress, though he did follow tradition by taking several [[Morganatic marriage|morganatic]] wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008 |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9308634 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090716141323/http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9308634 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 16, 2009 |title=Genghis Khan Biography (1162/7) |publisher=[[The Biography Channel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Börte]] had three more sons, [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]] (1187–1241), [[Ögedei Khan|Ögedei]] (1189–1241), and [[Tolui]] (1190–1232). Genghis later took about 500 secondary wives and "consorts", but Börte continued to be his life companion. He had many other children with those other wives, but they were excluded from succession, only Börte's sons being considered to be his heirs. However, a Tatar woman named Yisui, taken as a wife when her people were conquered by the Mongols, eventually came to be given almost as much prominence as Börte, despite originally being only one of his minor wives.&lt;ref&gt;"Genghis Khan: A Biography", Zofia Stone&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Leadership Secrets of Genghis Khan", John Man, Random House, 31 Oct 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The names of at least six daughters are known, and while they played significant roles behind the scenes during his lifetime, no documents have survived that definitively provide the number or names of daughters born to the consorts of Genghis Khan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Weatherford|first= Jack| authorlink =Jack Weatherford| title= [[The Secret History of the Mongol Queens: How the Daughters of Genghis Khan Rescued His Empire]] |year=2010 |publisher=Crown Publishing Group |place= New York |pages= xiii, 2   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uniting the Mongol confederations ==
{{See also|Proto-Mongols|List of medieval Mongol tribes and clans}}
[[File:Mongolia XI.jpg|thumb|The locations of the Mongolian tribes during the Khitan [[Liao dynasty]] (907–1125)]]
In the early 12th century, the Central Asian plateau north of China was divided into several tribes of [[confederation]], including [[Naimans]], [[Merkit]]s, [[Tatar]]s, [[Khamag Mongol]]s, and [[Keraites]], that were all prominent and often unfriendly toward each other, as evidenced by random raids, revenge attacks, and [[Looting|plundering]].

=== Early attempts at power ===
Temüjin began his ascent to power by offering himself as an ally (or, according to other sources, a [[vassal]]) to his father's ''anda'' (sworn brother or [[blood brother]]) [[Toghrul]], who was [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Keraites]], and is better known by the Chinese title "[[Wang Khan]]", which the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] granted him in 1197. This relationship was first reinforced when [[Börte]] was captured by the Merkits. Temüjin turned to Toghrul for support, and Toghrul offered 20,000 of his Keraite warriors and suggested that Temüjin involve his childhood friend [[Jamukha]], who had himself become Khan of his own tribe, the [[Jadaran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Grousset, Rene|title=Conqueror of the World: The Life of Chingis-khagan|location=New York|publisher=[[Viking Press]]|year=1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the campaign recaptured [[Börte]] and utterly defeated the [[Merkit]]s, it also paved the way for the split between Temüjin and Jamukha. Before this, they were blood brothers (''anda'') vowing to remain eternally faithful.

=== Rift with Jamukha and defeat at Dalan Balzhut ===
As [[Jamukha]] and Temüjin drifted apart in their friendship, each began consolidating power, and they became rivals. Jamukha supported the traditional [[Mongolian nobility|Mongolian aristocracy]], while Temüjin followed a [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] method, and attracted a broader range and lower class of followers.&lt;ref&gt;Hildinger 1997, pg. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his earlier defeat of the Merkits, and a proclamation by the [[Shamanism|shaman]] [[Kokochu]] that the [[Tengrism|Eternal Blue Sky]] had set aside the world for Temüjin, Temüjin began rising to power.&lt;ref name=Hildinger&gt;Hildinger 1997, pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt; In 1186, Temüjin was elected khan of the [[Mongols]]. Threatened by this rise, Jamukha attacked Temujin in 1187 with an army of 30,000 troops. Temüjin gathered his followers to defend against the attack, but was decisively beaten in the Battle of Dalan Balzhut.&lt;ref name=Hildinger /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lane1&gt;Lane 2004, pg. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jamukha horrified and alienated potential followers by boiling 70 young male captives alive in cauldrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jack|last=Weatherford|title=Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World|date=2005|publisher=Crown|isbn=978-0-307-23781-1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=January 28, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Toghrul, as Temüjin's patron, was exiled to the [[Qara Khitai]].&lt;ref name=Lane2&gt;Lane 2004, pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The life of Temüjin for the next 10 years is unclear, as historical records are mostly silent on that period.&lt;ref name=Lane2 /&gt;

=== Return to power ===
Around the year 1197, the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] initiated an attack against their formal vassal, the [[Tatars]], with help from the [[Keraites]] and [[Mongols]]. Temüjin commanded part of this attack, and after victory, he and Toghrul were restored by the Jin to positions of power.&lt;ref name=Lane2 /&gt; The Jin bestowed Toghrul with the honorable title of Ong Khan, and Temüjin with a lesser title of ''j'aut quri''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biran|first1=Michal|title=Genghis Khan|date=2012|publisher=[[Oneworld Publications]]|location=London|isbn=978-1-78074-204-5|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ndPZAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1200, the main rivals of the [[Khamag Mongol|Mongol confederation]] (traditionally the "Mongols") were the [[Naimans]] to the west, the [[Merkit]]s to the north, the [[Tanguts]] to the south, and the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] to the east.

[[File:Serven Khaalga Jurchen inscription.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jurchen script|Jurchen]] inscription (1196) in Mongolia relating to Genghis Khan's alliance with the Jin against the Tatars.]]

In his rule and his conquest of rival tribes, Temüjin broke with Mongol tradition in a few crucial ways. He delegated authority based on merit and loyalty, rather than family ties.&lt;ref name="Weatherford, Jack 2004 44"&gt;{{cite book|author = Weatherford, Jack|title = [[Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World]]|page = 44|publisher = [[Three Rivers Press]]|year = 2004|isbn = 0-609-80964-4|chapter = 2: Tale of Three Rivers}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an incentive for absolute obedience and the [[Yassa]] code of law, Temüjin promised civilians and soldiers wealth from future war spoils. When he defeated rival tribes, he did not drive away their soldiers and abandon their civilians. Instead, he took the conquered tribe under his protection and integrated its members into his own tribe. He would even have his mother adopt orphans from the conquered tribe, bringing them into his family. These political innovations inspired great loyalty among the conquered people, making Temüjin stronger with each victory.&lt;ref name="Weatherford, Jack 2004 44" /&gt;

=== Rift with Toghrul ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
[[Senggum]], son of Toghrul (Wang Khan), envied Temüjin's growing power and affinity with his father. He allegedly planned to assassinate Temüjin. Although Toghrul was allegedly saved on multiple occasions by Temüjin, he gave in to his son&lt;ref name="resurrection"&gt;{{cite book|author=Man, John|title=Genghis Khan: Life, Death and Resurrection|location=London; New York|publisher=[[Bantam Press]]|year=2004|isbn= 0-593-05044-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became uncooperative with Temüjin. Temüjin learned of Senggum's intentions and eventually defeated him and his loyalists.

[[File:Djengiz Khân et Toghril Ong Khan.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Genghis Khan and Toghrul Khan, illustration from a 15th-century [[Jami' al-tawarikh]] manuscript]]

One of the later ruptures between Temüjin and Toghrul was Toghrul's refusal to give his daughter in marriage to [[Jochi]], Temüjin's first son. This was disrespectful in Mongolian culture and led to a war. Toghrul allied with [[Jamukha]], who already opposed Temüjin's forces. However, the dispute between Toghrul and Jamukha, plus the desertion of a number of their allies to Temüjin, led to Toghrul's defeat. Jamukha escaped during the conflict. This defeat was a catalyst for the fall and eventual dissolution of the [[Keraites|Keraite]] tribe.

The next direct threat to Temüjin was the [[Naimans]] (Naiman Mongols), with whom Jamukha and his followers took refuge. The [[Naimans]] did not surrender, although enough sectors again voluntarily sided with Temüjin. In 1201, a [[kurultai|khuruldai]] elected [[Jamukha]] as [[Khan (title)|Gür Khan]], "universal ruler", a title used by the rulers of the [[Qara Khitai]]. Jamukha's assumption of this title was the final breach with Temüjin, and Jamukha formed a coalition of tribes to oppose him. Before the conflict, several generals abandoned Jamukha, including [[Subutai]], [[Jelme]]'s well-known younger brother. After several battles, Jamukha was turned over to Temüjin by his own men in 1206.

According to the ''Secret History'', Temüjin again offered his friendship to [[Jamukha]]. Temüjin had killed the men who betrayed Jamukha, stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army. Jamukha refused the offer, saying that there can only be one sun in the sky, and he asked for a noble death. The custom was to die without spilling blood, specifically by having one's back broken. Jamukha requested this form of death, although he was known to have boiled his opponents' generals alive.

=== Sole ruler of the Mongol plains (1206) ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Genghis Khan's enthronement in 1206.jpg|thumb|250px|Genghis Khan proclaimed Khagan of all Mongols. Illustration from a 15th-century [[Jami' al-tawarikh]] manuscript.]]
[[File:Mongol Empire c.1207.png|thumb|Mongol Empire c. 1207]]
The part of the [[Merkit]] clan that sided with the [[Naimans]] were defeated by [[Subutai]], who was by then a member of Temüjin's personal guard and later became one of Genghis Khan's most successful [[commander]]s. The Naimans' defeat left Temüjin as the sole ruler of the [[Eurasian Steppe|Mongol steppe]] – all the prominent confederations fell or united under his Mongol confederation.

Accounts of Genghis Khan's life are marked by claims of a series of betrayals and conspiracies. These include rifts with his early allies such as Jamukha (who also wanted to be a ruler of Mongol tribes) and Wang Khan (his and his father's ally), his son [[Jochi]], and problems with the most important [[shaman]], who allegedly tried to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother [[Qasar|Khasar]]. His [[military strategy|military strategies]] showed a deep interest in gathering [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and understanding the [[motivation]]s of his rivals, exemplified by his extensive spy network and [[Yam (route)|Yam]] route systems. He seemed to be a quick student, adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered, such as [[siege warfare]] from the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|Chinese]]. He was also ruthless, demonstrated by his tactic of [[measuring against the linchpin]], used against the tribes led by Jamukha.

As a result, by 1206, Temüjin had managed to unite or subdue the [[Merkit]]s, [[Naimans]], [[Mongols]], Keraites, [[Tatars]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule. This was a monumental feat. It resulted in peace between previously warring tribes, and a single political and military force. The union became known as the Mongols. At a ''[[Kurultai|Khuruldai]]'', a council of Mongol chiefs, Temüjin was acknowledged as [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the consolidated tribes and took the new [[#Name and title|title]] "Genghis Khan". The title [[Khagan]] was conferred posthumously by his son and successor Ögedei who took the title for himself (as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]]).

== Religion ==
Genghis Khan was a [[Tengrist]], but was [[Religious tolerance|religiously tolerant]] and interested in learning philosophical and moral lessons from other religions. He consulted [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks (including the Zen monk Haiyun), [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries, and the [[Taoism|Taoist]] monk [[Qiu Chuji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Teachings and Practices of the Early Quanzhen Taoist Masters |first=Stephen |last=Eskildsen |year=2004 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |page=17 |isbn=978-0-7914-6045-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Fozu Lidai Tongzai'' written by Nian Chang (b. 1282) Genghis Khan's viceroy [[Muqali]] was pacifying Shanxi in 1219, the homeland of Zen Buddhist monk Haiyun (海雲, 1203-1257), when one of Muqali's Chinese generals, impressed with Haiyun and his master Zhongguan's demeanor, recommended them to Muqali. Muqali then reported on the two to Genghis Khan who issued the following decree on their behalf: "They truly are men who pray to Heaven. I should like to support them with clothes and food and make them chiefs. I'm planning on gathering many of this kind of people. While praying to Heaven, they should not have difficulties imposed on them. To forbid any mistreatment, they will be authorized to act as ''darqan'' (possessor of immunity)." Genghis Khan had already met Haiyun in 1214 and been impressed by his reply refusing to grow his hair in the Mongol hairstyle and allowed him to keep his head shaven.&lt;ref&gt;Page 245, Validation by Holiness or Sovereignty: Religious Toleration as Political Theology in the Mongol World Empire of the Thirteenth Century, Christopher P. Atwood, The International History Review, Vol.26, No.2 (June 2004), [http://globalmiddleages.org/sites/default/files/pdf-files/atwood.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of his master Zhongguan in 1220, Haiyun became the head of the Chan (Chinese Zen) school during Genghis Khan's rule and was repeatedly recognized as the chief monk in Chinese Buddhism by subsequent Khans until 1257 when he was succeeded as chief monk by another Chan master [[Xueting Fuyu]] the Mongol-appointed abbot of Shaolin monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Page 216-217, Not Quite a Hybrid System: Khubilai's Buddhist Administration in Southeastern China, Feifei Wang, National University of Singapore, [http://www.kuasu.cpier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/6-2.Feifei-Wang-.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Genghis Khan summoned and met the Daoist master Qiu Chuji (1148-1227) in Afghanistan in 1222. He thanked Qiu Chuji for accepting his invitation and asked if Qiu Chuji had brought the medicine of immortality with him. Qiu Chuji said there was no such thing as a medicine of immortality but that life can be extended through abstinence. Genghis Khan appreciated his honest reply and asked Qiu Chuji who it is that calls him eternal heavenly man, he himself or others.&lt;ref&gt;Page 12, The Mongol Khans and Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, Sechin Jagchid, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol.2, No.1, 1979, [http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8475/2382 here]&lt;/ref&gt;  After Qiu Chuji replied that others call him by that name Genghis Khan decreed that from thenceforth Qiu Chuji should be called "Immortal" and appointed him master of all monks in China, noting that heaven had sent Qiu Chuji to him. Qiu Chuji died in Beijing the same year as Genghis Khan and his shrine became the [[White Cloud Temple]]. Following Khans continued appointing Daoist masters of the [[Quanzhen School]] at White Cloud Temple. The Daoists lost their privilege in 1258 after the Great Debate organized by Genghis Khan's grandson [[Mongke Khan]] when Chinese Buddhists (led by the Mongol-appointed abbot or ''shaolim zhanglao'' of Shaolin monastery), Confucians and Tibetan Buddhists allied against the Daoists. [[Kublai Khan]] was appointed to preside over this debate (in [[Shangdu]]/Xanadu, the third meeting after two debates in Karakorum in 1255 and 1256) in which 700 dignitaries were present. Kublai Khan had already met Haiyun in 1242 and been swayed towards Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Page 14-19, The Mongol Khans and Chinese Buddhism and Taoism, Sechin Jagchid, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol.2, No.1, 1979, [http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8475/2382 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Genghis Khan's decree exempting Daoists (''xiansheng''), Buddhists (''toyin''), Christians (''erke'üd'') and Muslims (''dashmad'') from tax duties were continued by his successors until the end of the Yuan dynasty in 1368. All the decrees use the same formula and state that Genghis Khan first gave the decree of exemption.&lt;ref&gt;Page 239, Validation by Holiness or Sovereignty: Religious Toleration as Political Theology in the Mongol World Empire of the Thirteenth Century, Christopher P. Atwood, The International History Review, Vol.26, No.2 (June 2004), [http://globalmiddleages.org/sites/default/files/pdf-files/atwood.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;  Kublai Khan's 1261 decree in Mongolian appointing the elder of the Shaolin monastery uses the same formula and states "''Činggis qan-u jrlg-tur toyid erkegü:d šingšingü:d dašmad aliba alba gubčiri ülü üjen tngri-yi jalbariju bidan-a irüge:r ögün atugai keme:gsen jrlg-un yosuga:r...ene Šaolim janglau-da bariju yabuga:i jrlg ögbei''" (''According to the decree of Genghis Khan which says may the Buddhists, Christians, Daoists and Muslims be exempt from all taxation and may they pray to God and continue offering us blessings...I have given this decree to the Shaolin elder to carry it''). According to Juvaini, Genghis Khan allowed religious freedom to Muslims during his conquest of Khwarezmia "permitting the recitation of the ''takbir'' and the ''azan''". However, Rashid-al-Din states there were occasions when Genghis Khan forbade Halal butchering. Kublai Khan revived the decree in 1280 after Muslims refused to eat at a banquet. He forbade Halal butchering and circumcision. The decree of Kublai Khan was revoked after a decade. Genghis Khan met Wahid-ud-Din in Afghanistan in 1221 and asked him if the prophet Muhammad predicted a Mongol conqueror. He was initially pleased with Wahid-ud-Din but then dismissed him from his service saying "I used to consider you a wise and prudent man, but from this speech of yours, it has become evident to me that you do not possess complete understanding and that your comprehension is but small".&lt;ref&gt;Page 246-248, Validation by Holiness or Sovereignty: Religious Toleration as Political Theology in the Mongol World Empire of the Thirteenth Century, Christopher P.

=== Western Xia Dynasty ===
{{Main|Mongol conquest of Western Xia}}
During the 1206 political rise of Genghis Khan, the Mongol Empire created by Genghis Khan and his allies shared its western borders with the [[Western Xia]] dynasty of the [[Tangut people|Tanguts]]. To the east and south was the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]], founded by the [[Manchu]]rian [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]], who ruled northern China as well as being the traditional overlords of the Mongolian tribes for centuries.

[[File:Siège de Beijing (1213-1214).jpeg|thumb|Genghis Khan entering [[Beijing]].]]

Genghis Khan organized his people, army, and his state to first prepare for war with Western Xia, or Xi Xia, which was close to the Mongolian lands. He correctly believed that the more powerful young ruler of the Jin dynasty would not come to the aid of Xi Xia. When the Tanguts requested help from the Jin dynasty, they were refused.&lt;ref name="resurrection" /&gt; Despite initial difficulties in capturing its well-defended cities, Genghis Khan managed to force the emperor of Xi Xia to submit to vassal status.

=== Jin dynasty ===
{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty}}
In 1211, after the conquest of Western Xia, Genghis Khan planned again to conquer the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]]. Wanyan Jiujin, the field commander of the Jin army, made a tactical mistake in not attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity. Instead, the Jin commander sent a messenger, [[Shimo Ming'an|Ming'an]], to the Mongol side, who defected and told the Mongols that the Jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass. At [[Battle of Yehuling|this engagement fought at Yehuling]], the Mongols massacred hundreds of thousands of Jin troops. &lt;!--Decades later, when the [[Taoism|Taoist]] sage [[Qiu Chuji]] was passing through this pass to meet Genghis Khan, he was stunned to still see the bones of so many people scattered in the pass. On his way back, he camped close to this pass for three days and prayed for the departed souls. --&gt; In 1215, Genghis besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day [[Beijing]]). This forced the Jin ruler, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin|Emperor Xuanzong]], to move his capital south to [[Kaifeng]], abandoning the northern half of his empire to the Mongols. Between 1232 and 1233, [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|Kaifeng fell to the Mongols]] under the reign of Genghis's third son, Ögedei Khan. The Jin dynasty collapsed in 1234, after the [[siege of Caizhou]].

[[Kuchlug]], the deposed [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Naimans|Naiman]] confederation that Temüjin defeated and folded into his Mongol Empire, fled west and usurped the [[khanate]] of [[Qara Khitai]] (also known as the Western Liao, as it was originally established as remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]]). Genghis Khan decided to conquer the Qara Khitai and defeat Kuchlug, possibly to take him out of power. By this time the Mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in China against the Western Xia and Jin dynasty. Therefore, Genghis sent only two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] (20,000 soldiers) against Kuchlug, under his younger general, [[Jebe]], known as "The Arrow".

With such a small force, the invading Mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters, leaving the Qara Khitai more vulnerable to Mongol conquest. As a result, Kuchlug's army was defeated west of [[Kashgar]]. Kuchlug fled again, but was soon hunted down by Jebe's army and executed. By 1218, as a result of the defeat of Qara Khitai, the Mongol Empire and its control extended as far west as [[Lake Balkhash]], which bordered  [[Khwarezmia|Khwarazmia]], a Muslim state that reached the [[Caspian Sea]] to the west and [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south.

=== Khwarazmian Empire ===
{{Main|Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia}}

In the early 13th century, the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] was governed by [[Shah]] [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Ala ad-Din Muhammad]]. Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarazmia as a commercial trading partner using the [[Silk Road]], and he initially sent a 500-man [[camel train|caravan]] to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, [[Inalchuq]], the governor of the Khwarazmian city of [[Otrar]], attacked the caravan, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarazmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and hand over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself, instead of the governor Inalchuq. The [[Shah]] had all the men shaved and the Muslim [[decapitation|beheaded]] and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]]), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed [[Ögedei]] to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarazmia.

[[File:During the battle of Indus.jpg|thumb|left|Genghis Khan watches in amazement as the [[Khwarezm]]i [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu|Jalal ad-Din]] prepares to ford the [[Indus]].]]

The Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons crossed the [[Tian Shan|Tien Shan]] mountains by entering the area controlled by the [[Khwarezmian Empire|Khwarazmian Empire]]. After compiling intelligence from many sources Genghis Khan carefully prepared his army, which was divided into three groups. His son [[Jochi]] led the first division into the northeast of Khwarazmia. The second division under [[Jebe]] marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarazmia to form, with the first division, a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] on [[Samarkand]]. The third division under Genghis Khan and [[Tolui]] marched to the northwest and attacked Khwarazmia from that direction.

The Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarazmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarazmian forces instead of facing a unified defense. The Mongol army quickly seized the town of [[Otrar]], relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions. Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan ordered [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] to hunt him down, giving them  20,000 men and two years to do this. The Shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire.

The Mongols' conquest, even by their own standards, was brutal. After the capital [[Samarkand]] fell, the capital was moved to [[Bukhara]] by the remaining men, while Genghis Khan ordered two of his generals and their forces to completely destroy the remnants of the Khwarazmian Empire, including not only royal buildings, but entire towns, populations, and even vast swaths of farmland.

[[File:Genghis Khan empire-en.svg|400px|thumb|Significant conquests and movements of Genghis Khan and his generals]]

The Mongols attacked [[Samarkand]] using captured enemies as body shields. After several days only a few remaining soldiers, loyal supporters of the [[Shah]], held out in the citadel. After the fortress fell, Genghis supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at Samarkand. The people of Samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city, where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory.&lt;ref name="Juvayni"&gt;"[https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118121401/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |date=January 18, 2012 }}", University of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]], a high official in the service of the Mongol empire, wrote that in [[Termez]], on the [[Oxus]], "all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain".&lt;ref name="Juvayni" /&gt;

The city of Bukhara was not heavily fortified, with a moat and a single wall, and the citadel typical of Khwarazmian cities. The city leaders opened the gates to the Mongols, though a unit of Turkish defenders held the city's citadel for another twelve days. Survivors from the citadel were executed, artisans and craftsmen were sent back to Mongolia, young men who had not fought were drafted into the Mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery. As the Mongol soldiers looted the city, a fire broke out, razing most of the city to the ground.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genghis Khan had the city's surviving population assemble in the main mosque of the town, where he declared that he was the flail of God, sent to punish them for their sins.

Meanwhile, the wealthy trading city of [[Konya-Urgench|Urgench]] was still in the hands of Khwarazmian forces. The assault on Urgench proved to be the most difficult battle of the Mongol invasion and the city fell only after the defenders put up a stout defense, fighting block for block. Mongolian casualties were higher than normal, due to the unaccustomed difficulty of adapting Mongolian tactics to city fighting.

As usual, the artisans were sent back to Mongolia, young women and children were given to the Mongol soldiers as slaves, and the rest of the population was massacred. The Persian scholar [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Juvayni]] states that 50,000 Mongol soldiers were given the task of executing twenty-four Urgench citizens each, which would mean that 1.2&amp;nbsp;million people were killed. The sacking of Urgench is considered one of the [[List of wars and disasters by death toll#Individual battles and sieges|bloodiest massacres in human history]].

In the meantime, Genghis Khan selected his third son [[Ögedei Khan|Ögedei]] as his successor before his army set out, and specified that subsequent Khans should be his direct descendants. Genghis Khan had left [[Muqali]], one of his most trusted generals, in command of all Mongol forces in Jin China while he battled the Khwarezmid Empire to the west.

=== Georgia, Crimea, Kievan Rus and Volga Bulgaria ===
{{Main|Mongol invasions of Georgia and Armenia|Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria}}
[[File:Mongol Great Khans coin minted at Balk Afghanistan AH 618 AD 1221.jpg|thumb|Mongol "Great Khans" coin, minted in 1221 at [[Balkh|Balk, Afghanistan]], AH 618]]

After the defeat of the Khwarazmian Empire in 1220, Genghis Khan gathered his forces in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Armenia]] to return to the Mongolian steppes. Under the suggestion of [[Subutai]], the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through [[Afghanistan]] and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]) contingent marched through the [[Caucasus]] and into Russia under generals [[Jebe]] and Subutai. They pushed deep into [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. The Mongols defeated the [[kingdom of Georgia]], sacked the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] trade-fortress of [[Caffa]] in [[Crimea]] and overwintered near the [[Black Sea]]. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the [[Cuman]]–[[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]] and the poorly coordinated 80,000 [[Kievan Rus']] troops led by [[Mstislav the Bold]] of [[Halych]] and [[Mstislav III of Kiev]] who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. [[Subutai]] sent emissaries to the [[Slavs|Slavic]] princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the [[Battle of Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They may have been defeated by the neighbouring [[Volga Bulgars]] at the [[Battle of Samara Bend]]. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event.&lt;ref name="Chambers31"&gt;John Chambers, ''The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe'', Atheneum, 1979. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Various historical secondary sources – Morgan, Chambers, Grousset – state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory.&lt;ref name="Chambers31" /&gt; The Russian princes then sued for peace. [[Subutai]] agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals. Six Russian princes, including [[Mstislav III of Kiev]], were put under this platform and crushed to death.

The Mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the Bulgar territory, allowing for the planning for [[Mongol invasion of Europe|conquest of Hungary and Europe]]. Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards, and Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia. These invasions added [[Transoxiana]] and [[Iran|Persia]] to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way. Later under Genghis Khan's grandson [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and the [[Golden Horde]], the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240.

=== Western Xia and Jin Dynasty ===
{{Main|Mongol invasion of China}}
[[File:China 11b.jpg|thumb|[[Western Xia]] dynasty, [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin/Jurchen dynasty]], [[Song dynasty]] and [[Kingdom of Dali]] in 1142]]
The vassal emperor of the Tanguts (Western Xia) had earlier refused to take part in the Mongol war against the Khwarezmid Empire. Western Xia and the defeated Jin dynasty formed a coalition to resist the Mongols, counting on the campaign against the Khwarazmians to preclude the Mongols from responding effectively.

In 1226, immediately after returning from the west, Genghis Khan began a retaliatory attack on the Tanguts. His armies quickly took Heisui, [[Ganzhou]], and Suzhou (not the Suzhou in Jiangsu province), and in the autumn he took [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Xiliang]]-fu. One of the Tangut generals challenged the Mongols to a battle near [[Helan Mountains]] but was defeated. In November, Genghis laid [[siege]] to the Tangut city [[Lingwu|Lingzhou]] and crossed the [[Yellow River]], defeating the Tangut relief army. According to legend, it was here that Genghis Khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory.

In 1227, Genghis Khan's army attacked and destroyed the Tangut capital of Ning Hia and continued to advance, seizing [[Lintiao]]-fu, [[Xining]] province, [[Xindu]]-fu, and [[Deshun]] province in quick succession in the spring. At Deshun, the Tangut general Ma Jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate. Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle. Genghis Khan, after conquering Deshun, went to [[Liupanshan]] ([[Qingshui County|Qingshui]] County, [[Gansu]] Province) to escape the severe summer. The new Tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the Mongols, and the rest of the Tanguts officially surrendered soon after. Not happy with their betrayal and resistance, Genghis Khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed, effectively ending the Tangut lineage.

== Succession ==
[[File:Genghis Khan and three of his four sons.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Genghis Khan and three of his four sons. Illustration from a 15th-century [[Jami' al-tawarikh]] manuscript]]
The succession of Genghis Khan was already a significant topic during the later years of his reign, as he reached old age. The long running paternity discussion about Genghis's oldest son Jochi was particularly contentious because of the seniority of Jochi among the brothers. According to traditional historical accounts, the issue over Jochi's paternity was voiced most strongly by Chagatai. In ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', just before the invasion of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] by Genghis Khan, Chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor. In response to this tension,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly for other reasons, Ögedei was appointed as successor.

=== Ögedei ===
{{Main|Ögedei Khan}}

Ögedei Khan, born Ögedei (c. 1185&lt;ref name="Societies, Networks , and Transitions: A Global History"&gt;"when Genghis Khan's successor, his son Ogedei (1185–1241), died"&lt;/ref&gt; – December 11, 1241) was the third son of Genghis Khan and second Great Khan ([[Khagan]]) of the Mongol Empire. He continued the expansion that his father had begun and was a world figure when the Mongol Empire reached its farthest extent west and south during the invasions of Europe and Asia.

=== Jochi ===
{{Main|Jochi}}

Genghis Khan was aware of the friction between his sons (particularly between Chagatai and Jochi) and worried of possible conflict between them if he died. He therefore decided to divide his empire among his sons and make all of them Khan in their own right, while appointing one of his sons as his successor. Chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior, because of statements he made that he would not follow Jochi if he were to become his father's successor. [[Tolui]], Genghis Khan's youngest son, was not suitable since in Mongol culture, youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age. If Jochi were to become successor, it was likely that Chagatai would engage in warfare with him and collapse the empire. Therefore, Genghis Khan decided to give the throne to Ögedei. Ögedei was seen by Genghis Khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate that might defuse the situation between his brothers.

Jochi died in 1226, during his father's lifetime. Some scholars, notably Ratchnevsky, have commented on the possibility that Jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from Genghis Khan. Rashid al-Din reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, and while his brothers heeded the order, Jochi remained in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]]. Jochi had attempted to protect Urgench from destruction, as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief. He concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by Jochi: "Genghis Khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands. I would be doing a service if I killed my father when he is hunting, made an alliance with Sultan Muhammad, brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the Muslims." Juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that Genghis Khan ordered his son secretly poisoned; however, as Sultan Muhammad was already dead by 1223, the accuracy of this story is questionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ratchnevsky|1991|pp=136–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and burial ==
{{Main|Tomb of Genghis Khan}}
[[File:Genghis khan empire at his death.png|thumb|Mongol Empire in 1227 at Genghis Khan's death]]
Genghis Khan died in August 1227, during the fall of [[Yinchuan]], which is the capital of [[Western Xia]]. The exact cause of his death remains a mystery, and is variously attributed to being killed in action against the Western Xia, illness, falling from his horse, or wounds sustained in hunting or battle.&lt;ref name="china at war"&gt;{{cite book|title=Genghis Khan|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jhPyvsdymU8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|accessdate=August 21, 2013|editor=Li, Xiaobing|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|location=[[Santa Barbara, California]]|isbn=978-1-59884-415-3|page=139|last = Emmons|first = James B.|work = China at War: An Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart-Davis|first=Adam|title=History: From the Dawn of Civilization to the Present Day|year=2007|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|location=London|isbn=1-4053-1809-0|page=165|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCouMhrlDzYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|authorlink=Adam Hart-Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Man|first=John|authorlink=John Man (author)|title=Genghis Khan: Life, Death, and Resurrection|year=2004|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-312-36624-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXTv9a0HZakC&amp;printsec=frontcover|pages=239–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', Genghis Khan fell from his horse while hunting and died because of the injury. He was already old and tired from his journeys. The ''[[Galician–Volhynian Chronicle]]'' alleges he was killed by the Western Xia in battle, while [[Marco Polo]] wrote that he died after the infection of an arrow wound he received during his final campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Genghis Khan|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Yclu5Rw-3WUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|last = Lange|first = Brenda|publisher = [[Infobase Publishing]]|year = 2003|isbn = 978-0-7910-7222-6|location = New York City|page = 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Mongol chronicles connect Genghis's death with a Western Xia princess taken as war booty. One chronicle from the early 17th century even relates the legend that the princess hid a small dagger and stabbed him, though some Mongol authors have doubted this version and suspected it to be an invention by the rival [[Oirats|Oirads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heissig, Walther|title=Die Mongolen. Ein Volk sucht seine Geschichte|location=Düsseldorf|year= 1964|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years before his death, Genghis Khan asked to be buried without markings, according to the customs of his tribe. After he died, his body was returned to [[Mongolia]] and presumably to his birthplace in [[Khentii Province|Khentii Aimag]], where many assume he is buried somewhere close to the [[Onon River]] and the [[Burkhan Khaldun]] mountain (part of the Kentii mountain range). According to legend, the funeral escort killed anyone and anything across their path to conceal where he was finally buried. The [[Genghis Khan Mausoleum]], constructed many years after his death, is his memorial, but not his burial site.

[[File:GhinggisKhanMausoleum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mausoleum of Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan Mausoleum]] in the town of [[Ejin Horo Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]

In 1939 [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] soldiers took the mausoleum from its position at the 'Lord's Enclosure' (Mongolian: ''Edsen Khoroo'') in Mongolia to protect it from Japanese troops. It was taken through Communist-held territory in [[Yan'an]] some {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on}} on carts to safety at a Buddhist monastery, the Dongshan Dafo Dian, where it remained for ten years. In 1949, as Communist troops advanced, the Nationalist soldiers moved it another {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} farther west to the famous Tibetan monastery of [[Kumbum Monastery]] or Ta'er Shi near [[Xining]], which soon fell under Communist control. In early 1954, Genghis Khan's bier and relics were returned to the Lord's Enclosure in Mongolia. By 1956 a new temple was erected there to house them.&lt;ref&gt;Man (2004), pp. 329–333.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 during the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Red Guards (People's Republic of China)|Red Guards]] destroyed almost everything of value. The "relics" were remade in the 1970s and a great marble statue of Genghis was completed in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Man (2004), p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2004, a joint Japanese-Mongolian archaeological dig uncovered what is believed to be Genghis Khan's palace in rural Mongolia, which raises the possibility of actually locating the ruler's long-lost burial site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3723218.stm|title=Palace of Genghis Khan unearthed|publisher=BBC   |date=October 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folklore says that a river was diverted over his grave to make it impossible to find (the same manner of burial as the Sumerian King [[Gilgamesh]] of Uruk and [[Atilla the Hun]]). Other tales state that his grave was stampeded over by many horses, and that trees were then planted over the site, and the permafrost also did its part in hiding the burial site.

Genghis Khan left behind an army of more than 129,000 men; 28,000 were given to his various brothers and his sons. Tolui, his youngest son, inherited more than 100,000 men. This force contained the bulk of the elite Mongolian [[cavalry]]. By tradition, the youngest son inherits his father's property. [[Jochi]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[Ögedei Khan]], and Kulan's son Gelejian received armies of 4,000 men each. His mother and the descendants of his three brothers received 3,000 men each.

{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}&lt;!--very few citations here, see [[WP:SUMMARY]]--&gt;
{{Main|Mongol Empire}}

=== Politics and economics ===
{{Main|Organization of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan}}
[[File:Mongol Empire map.gif|thumb|300px|[[Mongol Empire]]]]

The Mongol Empire was governed by a civilian and military [[code (law)|code]], called the [[Yassa]], created by Genghis Khan. The Mongol Empire did not emphasize the importance of [[ethnicity]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] in the administrative realm, instead adopting an approach grounded in [[meritocracy]]. The exception was the role of Genghis Khan and his family. The Mongol Empire was one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse empires in history, as befitted its size. Many of the empire's nomadic inhabitants considered themselves ''Mongols'' in military and civilian life, including [[Mongols]], [[Turkic people|Turks]] and others and included many diverse [[Khan (title)|Khans]] of various ethnicities as part of the Mongol Empire such as [[Muhammad Khan (Ilkhan)|Muhammad Khan]].

There were tax exemptions for religious figures and, to some extent, teachers and doctors. The Mongol Empire practiced [[religious tolerance]] because Mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept, and not subject to law or interference.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Sometime before the rise of Genghis Khan, Ong Khan, his mentor and eventual rival, had converted to [[Nestorian Christianity]]. Various Mongol tribes were Shamanist, Buddhist or Christian. Religious tolerance was thus a well established concept on the Asian steppe.

Modern Mongolian historians say that towards the end of his life, Genghis Khan attempted to create a [[civilian|civil state]] under the Great Yassa that would have established the legal equality of all individuals, including [[women's rights|women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/09/news/mongol.php|title=Mongolia sees Genghis Khan's good side|work=International Herald Tribune|date=May 10, 2005|author=Pocha, Jehangir S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence of this, or of the lifting of discriminatory policies towards sedentary peoples such as the Chinese. Women played a relatively important role in the Mongol Empire and in the family, for example [[Töregene Khatun]] was briefly in charge of the Mongol Empire while the next male leader [[Khagan]] was being chosen. Modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the [[Pax Mongolica]] ([[Mongol]] Peace).

Genghis Khan realised that he needed people who could govern cities and states conquered by him. He also realised that such administrators could not be found among his Mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities. For this purpose Genghis Khan invited a [[Khitan people|Khitan]] prince, [[Yelü Chucai|Chu'Tsai]], who worked for the Jin and had been captured by the Mongol army after the Jin dynasty was defeated. Jin had captured power by displacing Khitan. Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers. Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply. This reply impressed Genghis Khan. Chu'Tsai administered parts of the Mongol Empire and became a confidant of the successive Mongol Khans.

=== Military ===
{{Main|Mongol military tactics and organization}}

[[File:Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit, Tech Museum San Jose, 2010.jpg|thumb|Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit in San Jose, California, US]]

[[File:Mock Mongolian battle at Khaan Quest 07.jpg|thumb|Reenactment of Mongol battle]]
Genghis Khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as [[Muqali]], [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]], and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members. He allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the Mongol Empire capital [[Karakorum]]. Muqali, a trusted lieutenant, was given command of the Mongol forces against the Jin dynasty while Genghis Khan was fighting in Central Asia, and [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] were allowed to pursue the Great Raid into the Caucasus and [[Kievan Rus']], an idea they had presented to the Khagan on their own initiative. While granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions, Genghis Khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them.

The Mongol military was also successful in [[siege warfare]], cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers, taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army, &lt;!--Ratchnevsky, Grousset, Hartog, Morgan, will add ref--&gt; and adopting new ideas, techniques and tools from the people they conquered, particularly in employing Muslim and Chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the Mongol cavalry in capturing cities. Another standard [[military tactics|tactic]] of the Mongol military was the commonly practiced [[Withdrawal (military)|feigned retreat]] to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for [[ambush]] and [[counterattack]].

Another important aspect of the military organization of Genghis Khan was the [[transport|communications]] and [[Materiel|supply]] route or ''[[Yam (route)|Yam]]'', adapted from previous Chinese models. Genghis Khan dedicated special attention to this in order to speed up the gathering of [[military intelligence]] and official communications. To this end, Yam waystations were established all over the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Weatherford, Genghis Khan: War of the Khans (New York: Random House, Inc., 2004), 58&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Khanates ===
Several years before his death, Genghis Khan divided his empire among his sons [[Ögedei Khan|Ögedei]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[Tolui]], and [[Jochi]] (Jochi's death several months before Genghis Khan's meant that his lands were instead split between his sons, [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and [[Orda Khan|Orda]]) into several Khanates designed as sub-territories: their [[Khan (title)|Khans]] were expected to follow the [[Great Khan]], who was, initially, Ögedei.

[[File:Harhorin.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern-day location of capital [[Kharakhorum]]]]
Following are the [[Khanate]]s as Genghis Khan assigned them:
*'''[[Yuan dynasty|Empire of the Great Khan]]''': [[Ögedei Khan]], as ''Great Khan'', took most of Eastern Asia, including China; this territory later to comprise the [[Yuan dynasty]] under [[Kublai Khan]].
*'''[[Mongol]] homeland''' (present day [[Mongolia]], including [[Karakorum]]): [[Tolui]] Khan, being the youngest son, received a small territory near the Mongol homeland, following Mongol custom.
*'''[[Chagatai Khanate]]''': [[Chagatai Khan]], Genghis Khan's second son, was given Central Asia and northern [[Iran]].
*'''[[Blue Horde]]''' to Batu Khan, and '''[[White Horde]]''' to Orda Khan, both were later combined into the [[Kipchak Khanate]], or [[Golden Horde|Khanate of the Golden Horde]], under [[Toqtamysh]]. Genghis Khan's eldest son, Jochi, had received most of the distant Russia and [[Ruthenia]]. Because Jochi died before Genghis Khan, his territory was further split up between his sons. Batu Khan launched an invasion of Russia, and later Hungary and Poland, and crushed several armies before being summoned back by the news of Ögedei's death.

=== After Genghis Khan ===
{{See also|List of Mongol rulers}}
[[File:Ogadai Khan.jpg|thumb|upright|Genghis Khan's son and successor, [[Ögedei Khan]]]]
Contrary to popular belief, Genghis Khan did not conquer the whole area of the eventual Mongol Empire. At the time of his death in 1227, the empire stretched from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Sea of Japan]]. Its expansion continued for one or more generations. Under Genghis's successor [[Ögedei Khan]] the speed of expansion reached its peak. Mongol armies pushed into Persia, finished off the [[Western Xia]] and the remnants of the Khwarezmids, clashed with the imperial [[Song dynasty]] of China, and eventually took control of all of China in 1279. They also pushed further into Russia and eastern Europe.

== Perceptions ==
Like other notable conquerors, Genghis Khan is portrayed differently by conquered peoples than those who conquered with him. Negative views persist in histories written by many cultures from different geographical regions. They often cite the systematic slaughter of civilians in conquered regions, cruelties and destruction by Mongol armies. Other authors also cite positive aspects of Genghis Khan's conquests.

=== Positive ===

Genghis Khan is credited with bringing the [[Silk Road]] under one cohesive political environment. This allowed increased communication and trade between the West, Middle East and Asia, thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas. Some historians have noted that Genghis Khan instituted certain levels of [[meritocracy]] in his rule, was tolerant of religions and explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Foss, ''The Tyrants'', page 57, Quercus, London, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In Mongolia ====
Genghis Khan had been revered for centuries by Mongols and certain other ethnic groups such as [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], largely because of his association with Mongol statehood, political and military organization, and his victories in war. He eventually evolved into a larger-than-life figure chiefly among the Mongols and is still considered the symbol of [[Mongolian culture]].

During the communist period in Mongolia, Genghis was often described as a reactionary, and positive statements about him were avoided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chriskaplonski.com/downloads/Disappearing.pdf Christopher Kaplonski: ''The case of the disappearing Chinggis Khaan].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, the erection of a monument at his birthplace and a conference held in commemoration of his 800th birthday led to criticism from the Soviet Union and the dismissal of secretary Tömör-Ochir of the ruling [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] [[Central Committee]].

[[File:Chinggis Khan hillside portrait.JPG|thumb|left|Portrait on a hillside in Ulaanbaatar, 2006]]

In the early 1990s, the memory of Genghis Khan underwent a powerful revival, partly in reaction to its suppression during the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] period. Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity. He is considered positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes. For example, Mongolians often refer to their country as "Genghis Khan's Mongolia", to themselves as "Genghis Khan's children", and to Genghis Khan as the "father of the Mongols" especially among the younger generation. However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality. Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Griffiths |first=Daniel |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6252741.stm?lsf |title=Asia-Pacific &amp;#124; Post-communist Mongolia's struggle. |publisher=BBC News   |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mongolia today, Genghis Khan's name and likeness appear on products, streets, buildings, and other places. His face can be found on everyday commodities, from liquor bottles to candy, and on the largest denominations of 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 [[Mongolian tögrög]] (₮).

He reinforced many Mongol traditions and provided stability and unity during a time of almost [[endemic warfare]] between tribes. He is also credited for introducing the traditional [[Mongolian script]] and creating the first written Mongolian code of law, the [[Yassa|Ikh Zasag]] ("Great Administration").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Yasa of Chingis Khan|url=http://www.coldsiberia.org/webdoc9.htm|accessdate=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mongolian President [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]] has noted that the Ikh Zasag heavily punished corruption and bribery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech of President Elbegdorj at introduction of Partnering Against Corruption Initiative|publisher=Office of the President of Mongolia|url=http://president.mn/eng/newsCenter/viewNews.php?newsId=492|accessdate=August 1, 2013|date=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he considers Genghis Khan a teacher for anti-corruption efforts who sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. On the 850th anniversary of Genghis's birth, the President stated "Chinggis&amp;nbsp;... was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech by Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, President of Mongolia at a solemn assembly, dedicated to the 850th anniversary of birth of Chinggis Khaan|publisher=Office of the President of Mongolia|url=http://www.president.mn/eng/newsCenter/viewNews.php?newsId=848|accessdate=June 21, 2013|date=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, Mongolians see him as the fundamental figure in the founding of the Mongol Empire and therefore the basis for [[Mongolia]] as a country.

There are conflicting views of Genghis Khan in the People's Republic of China. The legacy of Genghis and his successors, who completed the conquest of China after 65 years of struggle, remains a mixed topic.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} China suffered a drastic [[Population decline|decline in population]].&lt;ref name="china"&gt;William Bonner, Addison Wiggin (2006).

In [[Inner Mongolia]] there are a monument and buildings dedicated to him and considerable number of ethnic Mongols in the area with a population of around 5 million, almost twice the population of [[Mongolia]]. While Genghis never conquered all of China, his grandson [[Kublai Khan]] completed that conquest and established the [[Yuan dynasty]] that is often credited with re-uniting China. There has been much artwork and literature praising Genghis as a military leader and political genius. The Mongol-established [[Yuan dynasty]] left an indelible imprint on Chinese political and social structures for subsequent generations with literature during the preceding [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] relatively fewer.

Genghis Khan supported the Chinese Daoist sect leader [[Qiu Chuji]] and after personally meeting him in what is now Afghanistan, gave him control of all religious affairs in northern China.

In the Middle East, and particularly in [[Iran]], Genghis Khan is almost universally condemned as a destructive and [[genocide|genocidal]] warlord who caused enormous destruction to the population of these areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/03/jun/1074.html "The Legacy of Genghis Khan" at Los Angeles County Museum of Art—again].&lt;/ref&gt; Steven R. Ward wrote that "Overall, the Mongol violence and depredations killed up to three-fourths of the population of the Iranian Plateau, possibly 10 to 15 million people.

In [[Afghanistan]] (along with other non-Turkic Muslim countries), he is generally viewed unfavorably, though some groups display ambivalence as it is believed that the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] of Afghanistan are descendants of a large Mongol garrison stationed there.&lt;ref name="Zerjal2003"&gt;{{cite journal |year = 2003|title = The Genetic Legacy of the Mongols|journal = The American Journal of Human Genetics|volume = 72|issue = 3|pages = 717–721|doi = 10.1086/367774|pmid = 12592608|last2 = Xue|first2 = Y|last3 = Bertorelle|first3 = G|last4 = Wells|first4 = RS|last5 = Bao|first5 = W|last6 = Zhu|first6 = S|last7 = Qamar|first7 = R|last8 = Ayub|first8 = Q|last9 = Mohyuddin|first9 = A|pmc = 1180246|last = Zerjal|first = T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Genetics: Analysis Of Genes And Genomes'' by Daniel L.

The invasions of [[Merv]], [[Samarkand]], [[Köneürgenç|Urgench]], [[Nishapur]], [[Bamyan]], [[Balkh]] and [[Herat]] among others caused mass murders, such as when large portions of [[Khorasan Province]] were completely destroyed. His descendant [[Hulagu Khan]] destroyed much of Iran's north and sacked Baghdad, although his forces were halted by the [[Mamluk]]s of [[Egypt]]. Hulagu's descendant Ghazan Khan once returned to beat the Mamluks and briefly gain the control of Syria, but were eventually defeated. According to the works of the Persian historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]], the Mongols killed more than 70,000 people in [[Merv]] and more than 190,000 in [[Nishapur]]. In 1237, [[Batu Khan]], a grandson of Genghis Khan, launched an invasion into Kievan Rus'. Over the course of three years, the Mongols annihilated all of the major cities of Eastern Europe with the exception of [[Novgorod]] and [[Pskov]].&lt;ref name="parallelsixty.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parallelsixty.com/history-russia.shtml|title=History of Russia|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121024544/http://www.parallelsixty.com/history-russia.shtml|archivedate=January 21, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the famous [[Mughal emperors]] were proud descendants of Genghis Khan and particularly [[Timur]], they clearly distanced themselves from the Mongol atrocities committed against the Khwarizim Shahs, [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Persian people|Persians]], the citizens of [[Baghdad]] and [[Damascus]], [[Nishapur]], [[Bukhara]] and historical figures such as [[Attar of Nishapur]] and many other notable [[Muslim]]s. However, Mughal Emperors directly patronized the legacies of Genghis Khan and Timur; together their names were synonymous with the names of other distinguished personalities particularly among the Muslim populations of South Asia.

In addition to most of the Mongol nobility up to the 20th century, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Babur]]'s mother was a descendant.

== Name and title ==
There are many theories about the origins of Temüjin's title. Since people of the Mongol nation later associated the name with ''ching'' (Mongolian for strength), such confusion is obvious, though it does not follow etymology.
[[File:GhinggisKhanMausoleumGate.jpg|right|thumb|The gate of Genghis Khan Mausoleum, [[Ordos (city)|Ordos]], [[Inner Mongolia]]]]
One theory suggests the name stems from a palatalised version of the Mongolian and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] word ''tenggis'', meaning "ocean", "oceanic" or "wide-spreading". ([[Lake Baikal]] and ocean were called ''tenggis'' by the Mongols. However, it seems that if they had meant to call Genghis ''tenggis'' they could have said, and written, "Tenggis Khan", which they did not.) Zhèng (Chinese: 正) meaning "right", "just", or "true", would have received the Mongolian adjectival modifier ''-s'', creating "Jenggis", which in medieval romanization would be written "Genghis". It is likely that the 13th-century Mongolian pronunciation would have closely matched "Chinggis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Lister|first = R.

The English spelling "Genghis" is of unclear origin. [[Jack Weatherford|Weatherford]] claims it derives from a spelling used in original Persian reports. Even at this time some Iranians pronounce his name as "Ghengiss". However, review of historical Persian sources does not confirm this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to the ''[[Secret History of the Mongols]]'', Temüjin was named after a powerful warrior of the Tatar tribe that his father Yesügei had taken prisoner. The name "Temüjin" is believed to derive from the word ''temür'', Turkic for iron (modern Mongolian: {{lang|mn|төмөр}}, ''tömör''). The name would imply a blacksmith or a man strong like iron.

No evidence has survived to indicate that Genghis Khan had any exceptional training or reputation as a blacksmith. But the latter interpretation (a man strong like iron) is supported by the names of Genghis Khan's siblings, Temülin and Temüge, which are derived from the same root word.

=== Name and spelling variations ===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from 'Genghis Khan' --&gt;
Genghis Khan is spelled in variety of ways in different languages such as [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] Chinggis Khaan, English ''Chinghiz'', ''Chinghis'', and ''Chingiz'', {{zh|c=成吉思汗|p=Chéngjísī Hán}}, [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]: ''Cengiz Han'', ''Çingiz Xan'', ''Çingiz Han'', ''Chingizxon'', ''Çıñğız Xan'', ''Chengez Khan'', ''Chinggis Khan'', ''Chinggis Xaan'', ''Chingis Khan'', ''Jenghis Khan'', ''Chinggis Qan'', ''Djingis Kahn'', [[Russian languages|Russian]]: Чингисхан (''Čingiskhan'') or Чингиз-хан (''Čingiz-khan''), etc. Temüjin is written in Chinese as {{zh|s=铁木真|t=鐵木眞|p=Tiěmùzhēn}}.

When [[Kublai Khan]] established the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1271, he had his grandfather Genghis Khan placed on the official record as the founder of the dynasty or ''Taizu'' ({{zh|太祖|Tàizǔ}}). Thus, Genghis Khan is also referred to as ''Yuan Taizu'' (Emperor Taizu of Yuan, {{zh|元太祖|Yuán Tàizǔ}}) in [[Chinese historiography]].

* Probably 1155, 1162, or 1167: Temüjin was born in the [[Khentii mountains]].
* When Temüjin was nine, his father [[Yesükhei]] was poisoned by [[Tatars]], leaving Temüjin and his family destitute.
* c. 1184: Temüjin's wife [[Börte]] was kidnapped by [[Merkit]]s; he called on blood brother [[Jamukha]] and [[Wang Khan]] for aid, and they rescued her.
* c. 1185: First son [[Jochi]] was born; leading to doubt about his paternity later among Genghis's children, because he was born shortly after Börte's rescue from the Merkits.
* 1190: Temüjin united the Mongol tribes, became leader, and devised code of law [[Yassa]].
* 1201: Victory over [[Jamukha]]'s [[Jadaran]]s.
* 1202: Adopted as Wang Khan's heir after successful campaigns against [[Tatars]].
* 1203: Victory over Wang Khan's [[Keraites]]. Wang Khan himself killed by accident by allied Naimans.

'''Hemanta Mukherjee''' (16 June 1920 – 26 September 1989); often credited as '''Hemant Kumar'''  outside [[West Bengal|Bengal]]) was an Indian [[music director]], [[composer]] and [[playback singer]],who sang in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Hindi]] and other [[Languages of India|Indian languages]]. He is also one of the known artists of [[Rabindra Sangeet]]. He won two [[National Film Awards|National awards]] for the category [[National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer|best male playback singer]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Early life==
Hemanta was born in [[Varanasi]], in the house of his maternal grandfather who was a leading physician. From the paternal side his family originated from Baharu of [[Jaynagar]]. They migrated to [[Kolkata]] in the early 1900s. Hemanta grew up there and attended Nasiruddin School and later [[Mitra Institution]] school of [[Bhawanipore]] area. There he met his longtime friend [[Subhash Mukhopadhyay (poet)|Subhas Mukhopadhyay]] who later became a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] poet. During this time, he developed a friendship with the noted writer [[Santosh Kumar Ghosh]]. At that time, Hemanta wrote short stories, Santosh Kumar wrote poems and Subhash Mukhopadhyay sang songs.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

After passing the intermediate examinations (12th grade), Hemanta joined [[Jadavpur University|Bengal Technical Institute]] at [[Jadavpur]] to pursue Engineering. However, he quit academics to pursue a career in music, despite objection from his father. He briefly tried literature and published a short story in the prestigious Bengali magazine called ''[[Desh (magazine)|Desh]]'', but by the late-1930s he was committed entirely to music.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Early music career==
Under the influence of his friend Subhas Mukhopadhyay, Hemanta recorded his first song for [[All India Radio]] in 1935. The first line of the song was "Amar Ganete Ele Nabarupi Chirantanii." Hemanta's music career was primarily mentored by the Bengali musician, [[Sailesh Duttagupta]]. In his early life Hemanta used to follow the famous Bengali singer [[Pankaj Mullick]]. For this he was nicknamed as "Chhoto Pankaj". In an interview on television in the early 1980s, Hemanta had mentioned that he had also received classical music training from [[Ustad Faiyaz Khan]]'s student [[Phanibhusan Banerjee]], but his tutelage was cut short by the Ustad's untimely death.

In 1937, Hemanta cut his first gramophone disc under the Columbia label. The songs (non-film) on this disc were "Janite Jadi Go Tumi" and "Balo Go Balo More" whose lyrics were by Naresh Bhattacharya and music was composed by Sailesh Duttagupta. Thereafter, every year Hemanta continued to record non-film discs for the [[Gramophone Company of India]] (GCI) till 1984. His first Hindi songs were "Kitana Dukh Bhulaya Tumne" and "O Preet Nibhanewali", released in 1940 under GCI's Columbia label. Music for these songs were composed by [[Kamal Dasgupta]]; lyrics were by [[Faiyaz Hashmi]].

Hemanta's first film song was in the [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film]] ''[[Nimai Sanyas]]'' released in 1941. Music was scored by Hariprasanna Das. Hemanta's first compositions for himself were the Bengali non-film songs "Katha Kayonako Shudhu Shono" and "Amar Biraha Akashe Priya" in 1944. Lyrics were by Amiya Bagchi.His first Hindi film songs were in ''[[Irada (1944 film)]]'' in 1944 under Pt. Amarnath's music direction. 
Hemanta is considered the foremost exponent of [[Rabindra Sangeet]]. His first recorded Rabindra Sangeet was in the Bengali film ''[[Priya Bandhabi]]'' (1944).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171205182037/http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu:80/pdasgupta/hemanta/discography/tagore.html Tagore Songs by Hemanta Mukherjee]. faculty.ist.unomaha.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The song was "Pather Sesh Kothaye". He recorded his first non-film Rabindra Sangeet disc in 1944 under the Columbia label. The songs were "Aamar Aar Habe Na Deri" and "Keno Pantha E Chanchalata". Prior to that he had recorded the song " '' Aamaar mallikabone '' " in All India Radio/Akashvani but, unfortunately, the record has passed into oblivion.&lt;ref&gt;Debashis Dasgupta, ''Desh'', Bengali weekly magazine from [[Anandabazar Patrika]] Ltd., Calcutta, 11 November 1989. P. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The songs were ''prangane mor shirishh shakhay'' and ''he nirupama''.]] {{fact|date=June 2009}} --&gt;

His first movie as a [[music director]] was the Bengali film ''[[Abhiyatri]]'' in 1947. Although many of the songs Hemanta recorded during this time received critical acclaim, major commercial success eluded him until 1947. Some contemporary male singers of Hemanta in Bengali were [[Jaganmay Mitra]], [[Robin Majumdar]], [[Satya Chowdhury]], [[Dhananjay Bhattacharya]], [[Sudhirlal Chakraborty]], [[Bechu Dutta]]&lt;ref&gt;S. Bhattacharya, ''Amar gaaner swaralipi'', A. Mukherjee Press, Calcutta, 1988. Pp. 82,83,84&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Talat Mahmood]].&lt;!-- {{fact|date=June 2009}} --&gt;

==Family==
Hemanta had three brothers and a sister, Nilima. His elder brother, Tarajyoti, was a short-story writer in Bengali. The youngest brother, [[Amal Mukherjee]], composed music as well as sang (Ehy Prithibithey Sharita Jibon) for some Bengali movies, most notably ''Hospital'' and ''[[Abak Prithibi]]''. He recorded a few Bengali songs in the 1960s and also composed music for one of the most memorable renditions – " ''Jiboner Anekta Path Eklai..''" – of Hemanta&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu/pdasgupta/hemanta/discography/filmlist1.html Mostly complete discography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- {{fact|date=June 2009}} --&gt;

In 1945, Hemanta married [[Bela Mukherjee]] (died 25 June 2009),&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Singer passes away |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-26/kolkata/28201327_1_hunger-strike-sourav-school-school-project|work=[[The Times of India]]|publisher=|date=26 June 2009 |accessdate=21 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a singer from [[Bengal]]. Although Bela had sung some popular songs in the movie, ''Kashinath'' (1943), with music by [[Pankaj Mullick]], she did not actively pursue her musical career after marriage. They had two children: a son, Jayant, and a daughter, Ranu. Ranu as [[Ranu Mukhopadhyay]] pursued a music career in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with somewhat limited success. Jayant is married to [[Moushumi Chatterjee]], an Indian film actress who was popular in the 1970s.

==Success and migration to Mumbai==
In the mid-1940s, Hemanta became an active member of the [[Indian People's Theatre Association]] (IPTA) and started an association with another active IPTA member — songwriter and composer [[Salil Chowdhury]]. One of the main driving forces behind the establishment of IPTA was the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] and the inaction of the British administration and wealthy Indians to prevent it.

In 1947, Hemanta recorded a non-film song called "Ganyer badhu" ("The rural bride") that had music and lyrics by Salil Chowdhury. The six-minute song recorded on two sides of a 78 rpm disc was sung at a varying pace and lacked the conventional structure and romantic theme of a Bengali song. It depicted an idyllic, prosperous and caring rural woman's life and family and how it gets ravaged by the demons of famine and ensuing poverty. This song generated an unforeseen popularity for Hemanta and Salil in eastern India and, in a way, established Hemanta ahead of his male contemporaries. Hemanta and Salil paired again in several songs over the next few years. Almost all these songs proved to be very popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu/pdasgupta/hemanta/articles/salilobi.html Salil Chowdhury's obituary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same period, Hemanta started receiving more assignments for music composition for Bengali films. Some were for director [[Hemen Gupta]]. When Hemen moved to [[Mumbai]] a few years later, he called upon Hemanta to compose music for his first directorial venture in Hindi titled ''Anandmath'' under the [[Filmistan]] banner. Responding to this call, Hemanta migrated to Mumbai in 1951 and joined Filmistan Studios. The music of ''[[Anand Math]]'' (1952) was a moderate success. Perhaps, the most notable songs from this movie is 'Vande mataram' sung by [[Lata Mangeshkar]], which Hemanta set to a marching tune. Following ''Anandamath'', Hemanta scored music for a few Filmistan movies like ''Shart'' in subsequent years, the songs of which received moderate popularity. Simultaneously, Hemanta gained popularity in Mumbai as a [[playback singer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenindia.com/old/fullstory.php?content_id=17266 Hemant Kumar: That velvet touch ]&lt;/ref&gt; His songs playbacked for actor [[Dev Anand]] under music director [[Sachin Dev Burman]] in movies like ''[[Jaal (1952 film)|Jaal]]'' ("''Yeh raat, yeh chandni phir kahan ... ''"), ''House No. 44'' ("''Chup hai dharti, chup hai chand sitare... ''"), ''[[Solva Saal]]'' ("''Hai apna dil to awara ..... ''"),  '' Funtoosh '' ("''Teri duniya mein jeene se ... ''"), and ''Baat ek raat ki'' ("''Na tum hame jaano ..... ''"),  became very popular and continues to be so. In the 1950s, he also play-backed for other heroes of Hindi films like Pradip Kumar (''Nagin'', ''Detective'') and Sunil Dutt (''Duniya Jhukti Hain'') and later in the 1960s for Biswajeet (''Bees saal Baad'', ''Bin Badal Barsat'', ''Kohra'') and Dharmandra (''Anupama''); he was the music composer for all these films.

==Career rise==

By the mid-1950s, Hemanta had consolidated his position as a prominent singer and composer. In Bengal, he was one of the foremost exponents of [[Rabindra Sangeet]] and perhaps the most sought-after male singer. In a ceremony organised by Hemanta Mukherjee to honour Debabrata Biswas (1911–1980), the legendary Rabindra Sangeet exponent, in Calcutta in March 1980, Debabrata Biswas unhesitatingly mentioned Hemanta as "the second hero" to popularise Rabindra Sangeet, the first being the legendary Pankaj Kumar Mallick. In Mumbai, along with playback singing, Hemanta carved a niche as a composer. He composed music for a Hindi film called ''[[Nagin (1954 film)|Nagin]]'' (1954) which became a major success owing largely to its music. Songs of Nagin remained chart-toppers continuously for two years and culminated in Hemant receiving the prestigious [[Filmfare Best Music Director Award]] in 1955. The very same year, he scored music for a Bengali movie called ''Shapmochan'' in which he played back four songs for the Bengali actor [[Uttam Kumar]]. This started a long partnership between Hemant and Uttam as a playback singer-actor pair. They were the most popular singer-actor duo in [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali cinema]] over the next decade.

In the latter part of the 1950s, Hemanta composed music and sang for several Bengali and Hindi films, recorded several Rabindra Sangeet and Bengali non-film songs. Almost all of these, especially his Bengali songs, became very popular. This period can be seen as the zenith of his career and lasted for almost a decade. He sang songs composed by the major music directors in Bengal such as [[Nachiketa Ghosh]], [[Robin Chatterjee]] and [[Salil Chowdhury]]. Some of the notable films Hemanta himself composed music for during this period include ''[[Harano Sur]]'', ''[[Marutirtha Hinglaj]]'', ''[[Neel Akasher Neechey]]'', ''[[Lukochuri]]'', ''Swaralipi'', ''[[Deep Jwele Jaai]]'', ''[[Shesh Parjanta]]'', ''Kuhak'', ''Dui Bhai'', and ''[[Saptapadi (1961 film)|Saptapadi]]'' in Bengali, and, ''[[Jagriti]]'' and ''[[Ek Hi Raasta (1956 film)|Ek Hi Raasta]]'' in Hindi.

==Movie production==

In the late 1950s, Hemanta ventured into [[movie production]] under his own banner: Hemanta-Bela productions. The first movie under this banner was a Bengali film directed by [[Mrinal Sen]], titled ''[[Neel Akasher Neechey]]'' (1959). The story was based on the travails of a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] street hawker in Calcutta in the backdrop of [[India's freedom struggle]]. The movie went on to win the [[President's Gold Medal]] — the highest honour for a movie from [[Government of India]]. In the next decade, Hemanta's production company was renamed Geetanjali productions and it produced several Hindi movies such as ''[[Bees Saal Baad (1962 film)|Bees Saal Baad]]'', ''Kohraa'', ''Biwi Aur Makaan'', ''Faraar'', ''Rahgir'' and ''[[Khamoshi]]'' — all of which had music by Hemanta. Only ''Bees Saal Baad'' and ''Khamoshi'' were major commercial successes.

Back in Bengal, Hemanta scored music for a movie titled ''Palatak'' in 1963 where he experimented with merging [[Bengal folk music]] and light music. This proved to be a major success and Hemanta's composition style changed noticeably for many of his future films in Bengal such as ''Baghini'', and ''[[Balika Badhu (1967 film)|Balika Badhu]]''. In Bengali films ''Manihar'' and ''Adwitiya'', both of which were major musical as well as commercial successes, his compositions had a light classical tinge. In 1961, for commemorating [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s birth centenary, Gramophone company of India featured Rabindrasangeet by Hemanta in a large portion of its commemorative output. This too proved to be a major commercial success. Hemanta went on several overseas concert tours including his trip to the [[West Indies]]. Overall, in the 1960s decade he retained his position as the major male singer in Bengal and as a composer and singer to be reckoned with in Hindi films.

In the 1960s he was the predominant and lead male voice in many of Tagore's musical dramas like ''Valmiki Pratibha'', ''Shyama'', ''Sapmochan'', ''Chitrangada'' and ''Chandalika''. With Kanika Bandopadhyay (1924–2000) and Suchitra Mitra (1924–2010), who were the lead female voices in these, he was part of the [[Rabindra Sangeet]] triumvirate that was popular and respected. It was referred as 'Hemanta-Kanika-Suchitra' and, with Debabrata Biswas, this quartet was and continues to be the mostly heard exponents of Tagore compositions. Asoktaru Bandopadhyay, [[Chinmoy Chattopadhyay]], [[Sagar Sen]], Sumitra Sen and Ritu Guha were the other leading exponents of Rabindra Sangeet at that time.

==Later career==

In the 1970s, Hemanta's contribution in Hindi films was nominal. He scored music for a handful of his home productions, but none of these movies were successful nor their music. In Bengal, however, he remained the foremost exponent of Rabindra Sangeet, film and non-film songs. His output continued to be popular for most of the decade. Some of them are '' Jodi jante chao tumi...'' (1972), '' Ek gochha rajanigandha '', '' Aamay prasno kore nil dhrubatara...'', Sedin tomay dekhechilam...'' (1974), ''Khirki theke singho duar...'' (''Stree'', 1971), ''Ke jane ko ghonta...'' (''Sonar Khancha, 1974), '' Jeona daraon bandhu...'' (''Phuleswari'', 1975 ) and popularised Rabindra sangeet using  them beautifully in films as per situations. A very popular and classic example is the song  ''Chorono dhorite diyogo amare..'' in ''Dadar Kirti'' (1980). In 1971, Hemanta debuted as a [[film director]] in for his self-produced Bengali movie ''Anindita''. It didn't fare exceedingly well at the box office. However, his rendition ''Diner seshe ghumer deshe..'' was one of his best and popular Rabindra Sangeet renditions . In the same year Hemanta went to Hollywood by responding to famous film director Conrad Rooks and score the music of Conrad's ''Siddhartha'' and played back [ ''O Nadire...'' ( composed and sang by him earlier in '' Neel Aakaser Niche '')] in that film. He was the first Indian singer to play back in Hollywood. The US government honoured Hemanta by conferring him with the citizenship of Baltimore, Maryland; the first ever singer of India to get USA citizenship. In the early to mid-1970s, two major music composers in Bengal, [[Nachiketa Ghosh]]  and [[Robin Chatterjee]], who had worked closely with Hemanta, since the early 1950s, died. Simultaneously, music composed by Hemanta for Bengali films like ''Phuleswari'', ''Raag Anurag'', " Ganadebata " and ''[[Dadar Kirti]]'' established him as the major film music composer in the Bengal movie scene. In 1979, Hemanta re-recorded some of his earlier works with composer [[Salil Chowdhury]] from the 1940s and 1950s. This album, titled ''Legend of Glory, vol. 2'' was a major commercial success, despite Hemanta's aged and slightly tired voice.

In 1980, Hemanta had a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] that severely affected his vocal capabilities, especially his breath control. He continued to record songs in the early eighties, but his voice was a shade of its rich [[baritone]] past. In 1984, Hemanta was felicitated by different organizations, most notably by the Gramophone Company of India, for completing 50 years in music. That very year Hemanta released his last album with Gramophone Company of India — a 45 rpm extended play disc with four non-film songs. Over the next few years, Hemanta released few non-film songs for small-time companies that had cropped up in the nascent cassette-based music industry. Only a few of these were commercially successful. He composed music for a handful of Bengali movies and one Bengali and one Hindi tele-series. However, by this time he had become an institution, a beloved and revered personality who was a courteous and friendly gentleman. His philanthropic activities included running a homeopathic hospital in memory of his late father in their native village in Baharu, in the South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. He continued to feature regularly on [[All India Radio]], [[Doordarshan]] (TV) and live programmes/concerts during this period.

In a television interview, recorded in early 1990s, to noted elocutionist Gauri Ghosh, his wife Bela Mukherjee recalled that she never knew during his lifetime the number of families and persons he helped to put up financially or otherwise; only after his departure that this truth gradually unveiled.
 
In 1987, he was nominated for Padmabhushan which he refused politely, having already turned down  a previous offer to receive Padmashree in the 1970s. In this year, he was publicly felicitated in Netaji Indoor Stadium in Calcutta for completing 50 years in musical journey, where, Lata Mangeshkar presented him with the memento on behalf of his fans and admirers.Despite his ageing voice, he became the Best Male Singer in 1988 for his rendition in the film "Lalan Fakir".

In September 1989 he travelled to [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] to receive the [[Michael Madhusudan Award]], as well as to perform a concert. Immediately after returning from this trip he suffered another heart attack on 26 September and died at 11:15 pm in a nursing home in South Calcutta.

==Legacy==
Nearly two decades after his death the Gramophone Company of India releases at least one album by Hemanta Mukhopadhyay every year, repackaging his older songs, because of the commercial viability of his songs. His legacy still lives on through the songs he has recorded, music he has composed, and through many male singers in Bengal and the rest of India who continue to imitate/emulate his singing style.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3021">'''International Overdose Awareness Day''' is a global event held on 31 August each year.  Its purpose is to raise awareness of overdoses, reduce the stigma of drug-related deaths and acknowledge the grief felt by families and friends. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scotland’s drug death toll could exceed 1,000 in 2018, group warns |url=https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/news/scotland/scotlands-drug-death-toll-could-exceed-1000-in-2018-group-warns/ |accessdate=17 September 2018 |publisher=Evening Express |date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was initiated by the [[Penington Institute]].

The '''submarine I-12''' was a Japanese [[Type A2 submarine|A2 type]] long-range fleet submarine. She was built at the Kawasaki's shipyard in Kobe.

==Wartime service==
The I-12 sailed from the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]] on 4 October 1944 to disrupt American shipping between the west coast and the [[Hawaiian Islands]].

The I-12 torpedoed and sank the [[Liberty ship]] ''[[SS John A. Johnson]]'', on 30 October 1944.  I-12, after ramming and sinking the lifeboats and rafts, then machine-gunned the 70 survivors in the water, killing 10. A [[Pan American Airways]] plane spotted the ''John A. Johnson's'' remaining men soon thereafter, and the [[USS Argus (PY-14)|USS Argus]] recovered them at 21:35 on 30 October. The ''Argus'' disembarked the men at San Francisco on 3 November.

==Sinking==
{{Main|USS Ardent (AM-340)}}
''I-12'' was sunk by the US minesweeper ''[[USS Ardent (AM-340)|Ardent]]'' and the USCG cutter ''[[USS Rockford (PF-48)|Rockford]]'' on 13 November 1944, 10 days after the sinking of the ''[[SS John A. Johnson]]'', near [[Kauai]] in the [[Hawaii]]an Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Yoshida p209&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ardent'' and the frigate ''Rockford'' were escorting a six-ship convoy midway between [[Honolulu]] and the United States. At 12:32, ''Ardent's'' [[sonar]] picked up a [[submarine]] contact. ''Ardent'' attacked first at 12:41, firing a 24-charge "[[hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]]" pattern, and again at 12:46 with a second "hedgehog" pattern. ''Rockford'' left her escort station to assist, and fired her first barrage of [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]] from her "hedgehog" at 13:08; two explosions followed, before an underwater detonation rocked the ship. ''Ardent'' carried out two more attacks and the [[frigate]] dropped 13 [[depth charges]] to administer the ''coup de grace''. The resulting explosions caused a loss of all contact with the I-12.

Wreckage recovered on the scene—deck planks, ground [[cork (material)|cork]] covered with [[diesel oil]], a wooden slat from a vegetable crate with Japanese writing and advertisements on it, pieces of varnished [[mahogany]] inscribed in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and a piece of deck planking containing Japanese builders' inscriptions—indicated a definite "kill".

'''Jeong Jung-bu''' (1106 – 18 October 1179) was a medieval [[Korean people|Korean]] soldier and military dictator during the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty (918–1392). He was a career soldier, qualified on military part of civil service examination. He was most noted for leading a [[coup d'état]] in 1170 (''Revolt of military officers''), dethroning the king and beginning of 100-year military reign in Korea.

==Early career==
Jeong was born in 1106; he learned [[martial arts]] and military [[Military tactics|tactics]] in his early days. He was often reported to be 7-foot-tall giant with great confidence and intelligence. He was a diligent soldier, and his loyalty earned him the trust from the king. He went through a slow promotion and later became Chief of General Staff.

At the time he became a soldier, the Goryeo Dynasty had a policy that put the civilian power over military. The policy benefited the dynasty well during its early days, and many civilian officials were also able military commanders, such as [[Gang Gam-chan]] and [[Yoon Gwan]]. However, the civilian rule made many side-effects as time passed on; the military generals was seen as servants, or even slaves of the civilian officials, and treated as slaves by many government officials and advisers to the king. In 998, [[Mokjong of Goryeo|King Mokjong]] put military under civilian command, causing the coup d'état of General [[Gang Jo]]. In 1014, military officers were not paid because the government had to pay civilian officials first, causing the anger of Generals [[Choi Jil]] and [[Kim Hoon]] to attempt a failed military rebellion; and later the government even closed the military academy. The grief of army officers became greater and greater as the treatment and view toward them got harsher.

==Coup==
In 1167, during the royal banquet of [[Uijong of Goryeo|King Uijong]], [[Kim Don-jung]], son of powerful aristocrat [[Kim Bu-sik]] (author of [[Samguk Sagi]]), burned Jeong's long beard with a candle, and made fun of him and also mocked the whole military. The incident caused Jeong to have a strong animosity toward aristocrats and civilian officials.

In 1170, King Uijong went to his royal villa to rest and to hold another feast, and he also held a martial arts competition. A young soldier won the event, and was praised by the king. Then, many of king's advisers to the court and eunuchs forced General [[Yi So-eung]], who was at his late fifties, to face the champion, who was about 20. The old general, of course, was not able to fight the young champion and fell down to the ground. Then, a young civilian official named [[Han Roe]], insulted the general and even slapped him across his face in front of the king and many fellow soldiers. General Jeong, who could not stand the advisers' attitude anymore, knocked Han out and insulted him. The incident caused the long grievances of military to explode; young soldiers, notably Colonels [[Yi Ui-bang]], [[Yi Go]] and [[Chae Won]], urged Jeong to launch a coup d'état against the entire government and the king, who favored civilian officials over army. Jeong first ignored their opinion but later agreed to revolt against the government. With his order, in the name of commander-in-chief, the whole army rebelled against the king and his advisers. Almost all of advisers, including Kim Don-jung and Han Roe, were killed and King Uijong was overthrown. Jeong then set up a puppet king, [[Myeongjong of Goryeo|King Myeongjong]], beginning the 100-year military rule of Korea.

==Post coup==
However, after the coup d'état in 1170, the leaders of the revolution began to feud with each other. Generals Yi Go and Chae Won were killed by General Yi Ui-bang for [[treason]]. Then Yi visited Jeong, who adopted him as a son, only for a while. In 1173, a surviving civilian official [[Kim Bodang]] rebelled in northeastern border, trying to restore the civilian order under deposed King Uijong. Yi Ui-bang decided to assassinate Uijong; and after he killed the ex-king, Yi put down the rebellion, which put Yi on the peak of the power. Then Yi began to oppress [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]], executed many civilian administrators and scholars, raped royal family members and forced the Crown Prince to marry his daughter. His despotic reign caused the grief of many people, and finally in 1174, a chain of rebellion that lasted for 50 years began in [[Pyongyang]] by [[Jo Wi-chong]]. Yi Ui-bang sent massive troops to put down the rebellion.

General Jeong, who promoted himself as Prime Minister, decided to put an end to Yi's reign of terror.  He ordered his son, [[Jeong Gyun]], and his son-in-law, General [[Song Yuin]], to kill Yi Ui-bang. Yi was finally murdered by Jeong Gyun, and the power passed to Jeong Jung-bu. Jeong continued to fight against rebels in Pyongyang; however, slaves and people of lowest class of present-day [[Gongju]] rebelled against the government. Jeong managed to crush the uprising of Jo, and entered negotiation with outcast rebellion leaders [[Mangyi]] and [[Mangsoyi]], but as the official army continued its campaign against the uprising, Mang brothers revolted again. They were executed in 1177, ending the rebellion; but many other impoverished people continued to revolt against the government.

With the law and order crumbling over the whole nation, Jeong decided not to retire from politics even though he was at his late 70's. His son Jeong Gyun, backed by his powerful father, accepted [[bribery|bribes]] from many officials who tried to gain more power and support from the reigning family; even Jeong's servants and slaves took bribes from politicians and brawled with some of them on the street. Politics drifted toward iniquity, and many people thought another coup d'état was necessary to put an end on Jeong's unjust rule.  In the end, General [[Gyeong Dae-seung]], the youngest general of Goryeo army, revolted against Jeong in October 1179, murdering Jeong Gyun and Song Yuin. Jeong Jung-bu was arrested for corruption and treason, and executed in public few days later.

'''John Hartley Brodie''' (1970 – January 28, 2006), was an American theoretical [[physicist]] specializing in [[string theory]]. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a psychotic episode in 2002, he left academia in 2004.

== Early life and education ==
 
Brodie was born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] to the British born [[Quakers|Quaker]] biochemists [[Angela Hartley Brodie]] and [[Harry Brodie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=John Hartley Brodie|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/109824702|accessdate=23 January 2016|publisher=Find a Grave}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather [[Herbert Hartley]] had also been a biochemist. He was raised in [[Columbia, Maryland]], where he graduated from [[Atholton High School]]. 
Brodie received [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] and [[master's degrees]] in physics from [[Cornell University]] in 1991 and 1992, respectively. He took one year off to travel the world, mainly in the [[Far East]], where he developed an interest in [[Eastern philosophies]] and [[Eastern religion|religions]].&lt;ref name=wp&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/washingtonpost/obituary.aspx?n=john-hartley-brodie&amp;pid=16647696#fbLoggedOut Obituary] The Washington Post, Feb. 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 
He returned to doctoral studies at [[Princeton University]], receiving a [[Ph.D.]] in [[theoretical physics]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

== Scientific career, 1998-2004==
Brodie accepted post-doctorate offers first at the [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory|Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]], and in 2001 at the [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]] in [[Waterloo, Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;
One of the first postdoctoral researchers at Perimeter institute, Brodie's work was notable for its breadth, ranging from [[non-perturbative]] effects in [[Supersymmetric gauge theory|supersymmetric gauge theories]] to string theoretic descriptions of [[Quantum Hall effect|quantum Hall]] fluids and of [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflationary cosmology]].&lt;ref name=peri&gt;[http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/news/alumni-wins-pis-john-brodie-memorial-award ALUMNI WINS PI'S JOHN BRODIE MEMORIAL AWARD]&lt;/ref&gt; During his short career, he published fifteen articles in peer-review journals, many of which have proven to be influential.&lt;ref name=peri/&gt;
In 2002, Brodie had a psychotic episode and was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]]. He tried taking medication, but searched for an alternative to [[mainstream medicine]].&lt;ref name=ref/&gt; 

== Humanistic life ==
In 2004, Brodie took a leave of absence from research and publication in disciplinary journals to teach at the [[Monteverde#Education|Monteverde Friends School]] in [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; Traveling to [[Nicaragua]], he helped construct housing for the poor with [[Habitat for Humanity]].&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; After his ID was stolen in Panama authorities stopped him on a bus and Brodie was held in jail.&lt;ref name=ref&gt;K. Ceccarossi [https://archive.is/20130216075709/http://kceccarossi.com/2011/03/a-troubling-intersection-police-and-the-death-of-john-brodie/ "The Death of John Brodie"] March 11, 2006. Brattleboro Reformer&lt;/ref&gt;    

In September 2005, after hiking much of the Appalachian Trail, he stopped in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]] and settled there.&lt;ref name=ref/&gt;
In Brattleboro, he worked packing grocery bags at the local Price Chopper supermarket and attended Quaker worship at nearby Putney Friends Meeting.{{cn|date=August 2017}} 

==Personal life and death ==
Brodie was "a sharp intellect, a free spirit and a gentle person".&lt;ref name=peri/&gt; Friends and family have compared him to the mathematician John Nash.&lt;ref name=ref/&gt;

On January 28, 2006, Brodie had been soliciting homes in [[Hinsdale, New Hampshire]], that he was running for President. Police responded to a call and confronted him, after which he fled into the [[Connecticut River]]. His body was found five days later "not far from where he entered the river, about 150 feet from shore".&lt;ref name=ref/&gt;

== Eponymous award ==
The [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]] has been awarding an annual prize in Brodie's memory to celebrate independence and creativity in theoretical research.&lt;ref name=peri/&gt; His work was notable for its breadth, ranging from nonperturbative effects in supersymmetric gauge theories to string theoretic descriptions of quantum Hall fluids and of inflationary cosmology.

'''Jonathan Cilley''' (July 2, 1802 – February 24, 1838) was a member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[Maine]].  He served part of one term in the [[25th United States Congress|25th Congress]], and died as the result of a wound sustained in a duel with another Congressman, [[William J. Graves]] of [[Kentucky]].

Cilley was a native of [[Nottingham, New Hampshire]], and was educated at [[Atkinson Academy]] and [[Bowdoin College]].  He settled in [[Thomaston, Maine]], where he studied law and attained admission to the bar in addition to editing the ''Thomaston Register'' newspaper.  A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Cilley served in the [[Maine House of Representatives]] from 1831 to 1836, and was [[List of Speakers of the Maine House of Representatives|Speaker]] in 1835 and 1836.

In 1836, Cilley was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]].  He served part of one term, and died as the result of a gunshot wound caused when he engaged in a [[duel]] with Representative William J. Graves.  They fired at each other with rifles three times, and on the third shot, Graves hit Cilley's [[femoral artery]], causing blood loss which resulted in Cilley's death.  He was temporarily interred at [[Congressional Cemetery]], and later reinterred at Elm Grove Cemetery in Thomaston.

==Early life==
Jonathan Cilley was born in [[Nottingham, New Hampshire]], and was the son of Jane (Nealley) Cilley and Greenleaf Cilley.{{sfn|''The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography''|page=109}}  He was the brother of [[Joseph Cilley (senator)|Joseph Cilley]], grandson of Major General [[Joseph Cilley (state senator)|Joseph Cilley]], and nephew of [[Bradbury Cilley]].{{sfn|''The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography''|page=109}}

Cilley attended [[Atkinson Academy]] and [[Bowdoin College]].{{sfn|''The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography''|page=109}}  He was a member of Bowdoin's famed class of 1825, which included [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].{{sfn|''The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography''|page=109}}  While at Bowdoin, Cilley also became close friends with future U.S. President [[Franklin Pierce]], a member of the class of 1824.{{sfn|''New England Must Not Be Trampled On''|page=79}} Deciding to stay in Maine after graduating from Bowdoin, Cilley [[reading law|studied law]] with [[John Ruggles]], was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in 1828, and practiced in [[Thomaston, Maine|Thomaston]].{{sfn|''The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography''|page=109}}

==Marriage and political career==
In 1829, Jonathan Cilley married Deborah Prince, the daughter of local businessman Hezekiah Prince.{{sfn|''The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography''|page=109}} Jonathan and Deborah had five children, two of whom died very young. Their surviving children were Greenleaf (b. 1829), Jonathan Prince (b. 1835), and Julia (b. 1837).{{sfn|''New England Must Not Be Trampled On''|page=219}}  Jonathan Prince Cilley became a [[Brigadier General]] by [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].{{sfn|''New England Must Not Be Trampled On''|page=219}} Greenleaf was a career officer in the [[United States Navy]].{{sfn|''New England Must Not Be Trampled On''|page=220}}  He married the daughter of a former Argentinian governor of the [[Falkland Islands]], and died there in 1898.{{sfn|''New England Must Not Be Trampled On''|page=220}} Julia was the wife of Ellis Draper Lazell (1832-1875).{{sfn|''John Lazell of Hingham And Some Of His Descendants''|page=104}}

==Fatal duel==
Cilley died in office after sustaining a fatal wound in a duel with Congressman [[William J. Graves]] of [[Kentucky]].{{sfn|''Ancient American Politics''|page=136}}  The climate surrounding the [[25th United States Congress|Twenty-fifth U.S. Congress]] was one of increasing [[partisan (political)|political partisanship]].{{sfn|''Ancient American Politics''|page=136}}  Majority [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] fought with minority [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] over the response to the [[Panic of 1837]], which was generally blamed on the policies of Democratic President [[Martin Van Buren]].{{sfn|''Ancient American Politics''|page=136}}  Underlying this conflict was lingering bitterness over the decision of Van Buren's predecessor, Democrat [[Andrew Jackson]], not to re-charter the [[Second Bank of the United States]].{{sfn|''Ancient American Politics''|page=136}}  One of the pillars of the Whig press was the ''[[New York Courier and Enquirer]]'', a newspaper edited by [[James Watson Webb]].{{sfn|''Ancient American Politics''|page=136}}

Democrats, including Jonathan Cilley, considered Webb's coverage of Congress to be biased and unfair; Cilley vented some of his party's bitterness in remarks made on the [[National Statuary Hall|House floor]], and suggested that Webb's change from opposing to supporting the re-chartering of the bank came about because Webb received loans from the bank totaling $52,000.{{sfn|''Ancient American Politics''|page=136}}  Webb, who considered himself insulted by Cilley's suggestion of ''[[quid pro quo]]'' corruption, persuaded a Whig friend, Congressman [[William J. Graves]], to deliver Webb's challenge to a duel.{{sfn|''Ancient American Politics''|page=136}}  Cilley refused to accept the letter, in terms which Graves decided were an insult to ''his'' honor; Graves then challenged Cilley, and Cilley felt honor bound to accept.{{sfn|''Ancient American Politics''|page=136}}  Dueling was prohibited within the boundaries of the [[District of Columbia]], so the participants and their seconds – [[George Wallace Jones]] for Cilley and [[Henry A. Wise]] for Graves – arranged to meet on February 24, 1838, at the [[Bladensburg Dueling Grounds]], just outside the city limits and inside the [[Maryland]] border.{{sfn|''Ancient American Politics''|page=136}}

As the challenged party, Cilley had the choice of weapons.{{sfn|''Ancient American Politics''|page=136}}  Because of Graves' reputation as an expert pistol shot, Cilley selected rifles, with the distance between the duelists to be 80 yards, a distance far enough apart to negate Graves' supposed shooting skill; in actuality, the marked off distance was 94 yards.{{sfn|''Ancient American Politics''|page=136}}  After their first fire missed, the participants shortened the distance and fired again, but again both shots missed.{{sfn|''Ancient American Politics''|page=136}}  On the third exchange of shots, Graves fatally wounded Cilley by shooting him through the [[femoral artery]].{{sfn|''Ancient American Politics''|page=136}}  Cilley bled to death on the dueling ground within a matter of minutes.{{sfn|''Ancient American Politics''|page=136}}  He was buried at [[Congressional Cemetery]],{{sfn|''Crime Buff's Guide to Outlaw Washington, DC''|page=37}} and re-interred at Elm Grove Cemetery in [[Thomaston, Maine]].{{sfn|''New England Must Not Be Trampled On''|page=1}}

==Legacy==
There is a [[cenotaph]] to Cilley's memory located at Congressional Cemetery.{{sfn|''Crime Buff's Guide to Outlaw Washington, DC''|page=37}}

After Cilley's death, longtime friend [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] published two biographical sketches of him.{{sfn|''The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography''|page=110}}  His colleagues paid tribute to him by passing a federal law on February 20, 1839, which strengthened the strict prohibition against dueling in Washington, D.C. by making it a crime to issue or accept a challenge within district limits, even if the actual duel was to take place outside the district.{{sfn|''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 1774-2005''|page=1148}}

'''Dr José Tomás de Sousa Martins''' (7 March 1843 – 18 August 1897) was a doctor renowned for his work amongst the poor in [[Lisbon]], Portugal. After his death, a secular cult arose around his personality, in which he is thanked for "miraculous" cures.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Sousa Martins was born in [[Alhandra,_Portugal|Alhandra]] (near [[Vila Franca de Xira]]) on 7 March 1843, the son of Caetano Martins, a [[carpenter]], and Maria das Dores de Sousa Martins. The household was a poor one, and became poorer still after Caetano's death in 1851, when José was seven years old. He spent his childhood and completed his primary education in Alhandra. At the age of 12, his mother advised him to leave for Lisbon where his maternal uncle, Lázaro Joaquim de Sousa Pereira, had established himself as a [[pharmacy|pharmacist]].

He worked as an apprentice and later a "praticante" in his uncle's pharmacy, while simultaneously attending the National Lyceum in Lisbon. He became adept at manipulating natural products and so acquired an experience that he would later come to value in his medical work.

===Studies in Lisbon===
After completing his secondary education, he continued with preparatory studies at the [[University_of_Lisbon_(1911–2013)|Escola Politécnica de Lisboa (Lisbon Polytechnic School)]] in 1861, and then entered the [[FacultyofPharmacy,UniversityofLisbon|Medical-Surgical School of Lisbon]] The knowledge he had acquired as a pharmacy practitioner helped him to graduate as a pharmacist in 1864, at the age of 21. After completing the course in pharmacy, Sousa Martins decided to continue his studies. In 1866 he completed the course in medicine as well, with a thesis dedicated to the musculature of the heart.

===Medical career===
In 1868 he was appointed, after a public competition, to the position of lecturer of the Medical Section of the Medical and Surgical School of Lisbon (today the medical faculty of the [[University of Lisbon]]). That same year, he was also elected member of the Society of Medical Sciences of Lisbon, beginning a career linked to teaching and research in the area of Medicine.

He had already been admitted to the Sociedade Farmacêutica Lusitana (Lusitanian Pharmaceutal Society) on 13 July 1864, and quickly assumed a pivotal role in the life of the society, authoring multiple reports and opinions over the next decade, and publishing several articles in its journal. As a long-standing member of the society's Public Health Commission, he played an important role in drawing attention to, and eventually regulating, various hazardous pharmaceutical practices. In 1867, he became a corresponding member of the [[Lisbon_Academy_of_Sciences|Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon]]. He became an honorary member of the Pharmaceutical Society in appreciation of his role as the Portuguese representative at the [[International_Sanitary_Conferences|International Sanitary Conference]] in Vienna in 1874.

Meanwhile his career inside the Medical-Surgical School progressed, with appointments as senior lecturer in 1872, and extraordinary doctor of the Hospital of San José in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Hospital de São José|Portuguese Wikipedia page on the São José hospital in Lisbon]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}

By this time, Sousa Martins had earned himself a place among the intelligentsia of Lisbon. As a doctor and teacher, he attached great importance to the psychological and human component of medical practice, and included the following advice in his lectures:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When you enter a hospital at night and you hear a patient groan, go to his bed, see what the poor sick man needs, and if you have nothing else to give him, give him a smile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seleccoes.pt/1/sousa_martins_o_santo_que_nao_acreditava_em_deus_2281383.html Carla Jesus, Sousa Martins, o santo que não acreditava em Deus. Selecções.pt, accessed 24 January 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Serra da Estrela and campaign against tuberculosis===
His activity in the Hospital de San José, and in particular his efforts on behalf of the poorest patients, affirmed him as one of the highest regarded physicians in Portugal. He gained enormous prestige because of his fight against tuberculosis, which had reached epidemic proportions in Lisbon. Leading a scientific expedition to the [[Serra da Estrela]] mountain range, he advocated the construction in those mountains of sanatoriums intended for the combat of the disease. 

In particular, Sousa Martins considered the Penhas Douradas formation near [[Manteigas]] to be the healthiest place in the country, thanks to its fresh and clean air. The scientific expedition to the Serra da Estrela had been organized under the aegis of the [[Lisbon Geographic Society]], of which Sousa Martins was a founding member and member of the Central Council. Gathering in August 1881, a plethora of scientists and intellectuals came together to study the geographical, meteorological and anthropological aspects of the region in an unprecedented effort aimed at systematically exploring the Portuguese territory.

Following the expedition, Sousa Martins defended the implementation of [[sanatorium]]s in the mountain region, and was one of the founders of the foundation of Club Hermínio, a humanitarian association created in 1888 and active until at least 1892. Club Hermínio had the purpose of promoting the improvement of the natural conditions of the Serra da Estrela, through the establishment of health homes under medical supervision, the relief of poor patients and the exercise of hygienic control in the homes that were used by the patients.

Sousa Martins’ main objective was the construction of a sanatorium in Serra da Estrela that could permanently host and treat patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. In spite of his efforts and influence with the Crown (he was a honorary doctor of the Royal House since 1888) and with the Government, the initiative, although universally supported, was slow to materialize, and the sanatorium he had proposed would not be built until after his death.

===Illness and death===
In 1897, Sousa Martins was delegated to the [[International_Sanitary_Conferences|International Sanitary Conference]], held in [[Venice]], where he was elected vice president. Having already gotten ill in Venice, he returned to Lisbon very weak. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis and left for the Serra da Estrela for relief. Apparently convalescing, he retired to Alhandra, where he stayed in a farm that was owned by some of his friends, in an effort to convalesce.

However, the disease worsened and after he contracted cardiac problems in addition to what now seemed to be terminal tuberculosis, Sousa Martins committed suicide on 18 August 1897 using a large injection of morphine. Shortly before, he had confided to a friend: "Death is not stronger than I am" and "A doctor threatened with death by two diseases, both fatal, should be eliminated by himself."

In his eulogy of Sousa Martins, King [[Carlos_I_of_Portugal|Carlos I]] of Portugal said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;When he left the world, all the land that knew him wept. It was an irreparable loss, a national loss, with the greatest light of my kingdom fading away.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy and cult==
In 1904, a statue of Sousa Martins was erected in the [[Campo dos Mártires da Pátria]] in Lisbon, outside the current Faculty of Medicinal Sciences ([[New University of Lisbon]]). This statue has become the centre of a quasi-religious cult in which the spirit of Dr Sousa Martins is believed able to assist in cures. The foot of the statue is surrounded by marble plaques giving thanks to him for unexpected cures, some calling him "Brother", candles burn all around it and flowers are placed there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thelisbonconnection.com/the-miraculous-cures-of-dr-sousa-martins-once-a-doctor-now-a-saint-memorial-statue-lisbon-in-front-of-the-faculty-of-medicine/ "The ‘miraculous’ cures of Dr. Sousa Martins: once a doctor now a Saint &amp; Memorial Statue Lisbon in front of the Faculty of Medicine". The Lisbon Connection. Accessed 1 October 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other sites of veneration too: the Cemetery of Alhandra, where he is buried; The Dr. Sousa Martins House Museum in Alhandra, and his bust in Largo 7 de Março, in downtown Alhandrense. On 7 March and 18 August of each year, the anniversaries of his birth and death, thousands of devotees visit and pray at his tomb and other places where he is represented.

Adherents of [[spiritism]] have claimed Sousa Martins as one of their own, although there is no evidence he ever showed any interest in the movement. However, followers have ascribed miraculous healings to their psychic communications with him.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Dacosta, ''Os Mal Amados'', Casa das Letras, Lisboa, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite (or because) of its religious overtones, his veneration was never recognized by the Catholic Church but it remains until today.

'''''Latimeria''''' is a rare genus of [[fish]] that includes two [[Extant taxon|extant]] species: [[West Indian Ocean coelacanth]] (''Latimeria chalumnae'') and the [[Indonesian coelacanth]] (''Latimeria menadoensis''). They follow the oldest known living [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] of [[Sarcopterygii]] (lobe-finned fish and [[tetrapod]]s), which means they are more closely related to [[lungfish]], [[reptiles]] and [[mammals]] than to the common [[ray-finned fishes]].

They are found along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean and Indonesia.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1999PNAS...9612616H |title=Two Living Species of Coelacanths? |author1=Holder |first1=Mark T. |last2=Erdmann |first2=Mark V. |last3=Wilcox |first3=Thomas P. |last4=Caldwell |first4=Roy L. |last5=Hillis |first5=David M. |volume=96 |year=1999 |pages=12616–20 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.22.12616 |pmid=10535971 |issue=22 |pmc=23015 |jstor=49396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref10"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Butler |first=Carolyn |title=Living Fossil Fish |journal=National Geographic |date=March 2011 |pages=86–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since there are only two species of coelacanth and both are threatened, it is one of the most endangered genus of animals in the world. The West Indian Ocean coelacanth is a [[critically endangered species]].&lt;ref name=IUCN&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Musick, J.

==Biological characteristics==
[[Image:Latimeria.jpg|thumb|left|''Latimeria chalumnae'' specimen, Zoologisk Museum, Copenhagen]] 
Based on growth rings in the creatures' ear bones ([[otoliths]]), scientists infer that individual coelacanths may live as long as 80 to 100 years. Coelacanths live as deep as 700&amp;nbsp;m (2300&amp;nbsp;ft) below [[sea level]], but are more commonly found at depths of 90 to 200 m.

Living examples of ''[[Latimeria chalumnae]]'' have a deep blue color which probably camouflages them from prey species; however, the Indonesian species (''[[Latimeria menadoensis|L.&amp;nbsp;menadoensis]]'') is brown.

Coelacanth eyes are very sensitive, and have a ''[[tapetum lucidum]]''. Coelacanths are almost never caught in the daytime, but have been caught at all phases of the moon. Coelacanth eyes have many [[rod cell|rods]], receptors in the retina that help animals see in dim light. Together, the rods and [[tapetum lucidum|tapetum]] help the fish see better in dark water.

Coelacanths are opportunistic feeders, hunting [[cuttlefish]], [[squid]], [[snipe eel]]s, small [[shark]]s, and other fish found in their deep reef and volcanic slope [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s. Coelacanths are also known to swim head down, backwards or belly up to locate their prey, presumably using their [[Rostral organ|rostral gland]]s.

Scientists suspect that one reason this fish has been so successful is that specimens are able to slow down their [[metabolism]]s at will, sinking into the less-inhabited depths and minimizing their nutritional requirements in a sort of [[hibernation]] mode.
[[Image:Coelacanth1.JPG|thumb|''Latimeria chalumnae'' model in the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], showing the coloration in life]]
The coelacanths which live near [[Sodwana Bay]], [[South Africa]], rest in caves at depths of 90 to 150 m during daylight hours, but disperse and swim to depths as shallow as 55 m when hunting at night. The depth is not as important as their need for very dim light and, more importantly, for water which has a temperature of 14 to 22&amp;nbsp;°C.  They will rise or sink to find these conditions. The amount of [[oxygen]] their blood can absorb from the water through the gills is dependent on water temperature.

Scientific research suggests the coelacanth must stay in cold, well-oxygenated water or else its blood cannot absorb enough oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;page 200, Weinberg, Samantha. 2006. A Fish Caught in Time: the Search for the Coelacanth. HarperCollins Publishers, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; The fish seems to be very well adapted to its environment, which is seen as one of the reasons why it has the slowest evolving genome of all known vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/the-living-fossil-coelacanth-fish-left-behind-by-evolution-8577129.html The 'living fossil' coelacanth fish left behind by evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
Female coelacanths [[ovoviviparity|give birth to live young]], called "pups", in groups of between five and 25 [[spawn (biology)#Fry|fry]] at a time; the pups are capable of surviving on their own immediately after birth. Their reproductive behaviors are not well known, but it is believed that they are not [[Sexual maturity|sexually mature]] until after 20 years of age. Gestation time is estimated to be 13 to 15 months.

===First find in South Africa===
[[File:Daily Dispatch.jpg|thumb|The discovery was covered in a 1939 ''[[Daily Dispatch]]'' article]]
On December 23, 1938, Hendrik Goosen, the captain of the [[Commercial trawler|trawler]] ''Nerine'', returned to the harbour at [[East London, South Africa]], after a trawl between the [[Chalumna River|Chalumna]] and Ncera Rivers. As he frequently did, he telephoned his friend, [[Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer]], curator at East London's small museum, to see if she wanted to look over the contents of the catch for anything interesting, and told her of the strange fish he has set aside for her.

Correspondence in the archives of the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (SAIAB, formerly the JLB Smith Institute of Ichthyology) show that Goosen went to great lengths to avoid any damage to this fish and ordered his crew to set it aside for the East London Museum.  Goosen later told how the fish was steely blue when first seen, but by the time the 'Nerine' entered East London harbour many hours later, the fish had become dark grey.

Failing to find a description of the creature in any of her books, she attempted to contact her friend, Professor [[James Leonard Brierley Smith]], but he was away for Christmas.  Unable to preserve the fish, she reluctantly sent it to a [[taxidermy|taxidermist]].  When Smith returned, he immediately recognized it as a type of coelacanth, a group of fish previously known only from fossils. Smith named the new coelacanth ''Latimeria chalumnae'' in honor of [[Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer]] and the waters in which it was found.  The two discoverers received immediate recognition, and the fish became known as a "[[living fossil]]". The 1938 coelacanth is still on display in the [[East London, South Africa]], museum.

However, as the specimen had been stuffed, the [[gill]]s and [[skeleton]] were not available for examination, and some doubt therefore remained as to whether it was truly the same species. Smith began a hunt for a second specimen that would take more than a decade.

===Comoros===
[[Image:Latimeria Chalumnae - Coelacanth - NHMW.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Preserved specimen of ''Latimeria chalumnae'' in the [[Naturhistorisches Museum|Natural History Museum]], Vienna, Austria (length: 170 cm - weight: 60 kg). This specimen was caught on 18 October 1974, next to Salimani/Selimani (Grand Comoro, Comoro Islands) {{Coord|11|48|40.7|S|43|16|3.3|E}}.]]

Smith distributed thousands of flyers with a photograph of the fish, description, and reward, but World War II interrupted the search. He also did not not know that the 1938 specimen near South Africa was about {{convert|1800|mi}} south of its normal habitat.&lt;ref name="ley196510"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 100 [[Pound sterling]] reward was a very substantial sum to the average subsistence fisherman of the time. Fourteen years later, one specimen was found in the [[Comoros]], but the fish was no stranger to the locals; in the port of Domoni on the Comoran island of [[Anjouan]], the Comorians were puzzled to be so rewarded for a "gombessa" or "mame", their names for the nearly inedible fish that their fishermen occasionally caught by mistake.

The second specimen, found just before Christmas 1952{{r|ley196510}} by Comoran fisherman Ahamadi Abdallah, was described as a different species, first as ''Malania hunti'' and later as ''Malania anjounae'', after [[Daniel François Malan]], the [[South African Prime Minister]] who had dispatched an [[South African Air Force|SAAF]] [[C-47 Skytrain|Dakota]] at the behest of Professor Smith to fetch the specimen. It was later discovered that the lack of a first [[dorsal fin]], at first thought to be significant, was caused by an injury early in the specimen's life. Malan was a staunch [[creationism|creationist]]; when he was first shown the primitive creature, he exclaimed, with a twinkle, "My, it is ugly. Do you mean to say we once looked like that?"&lt;ref&gt;page 73, Weinberg, Samantha. 2006. A Fish Caught in Time: the Search for the Coelacanth. HarperCollins Publishers, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; The specimen retrieved by Smith is on display at the [[SAIAB]] in [[Grahamstown]], [[South Africa]] where he worked.

A third specimen was caught in September 1953 and a fourth in January 1954.{{r|ley196510}} The Comorans are now aware of the significance of the [[endangered species]], and have established a program to return accidentally-caught coelacanth to deep water.

As for Smith, who died in 1968, his account of the coelacanth story appeared in the book ''Old Fourlegs'', first published in 1956.  His book ''Sea Fishes of the Indian Ocean'', illustrated and co-authored by his wife Margaret, remains the standard [[Ichthyology|ichthyological]] reference for the region.

In 1988, marine biologist [[Hans Fricke]] was the first to photograph the species in its natural habitat, {{convert|180|m|ft|-1}} off [[Grand Comoro]]'s west coast.&lt;ref name="NatlGeo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fricke|first=Hans|title=Coelacanths:The fish that time forgot|journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|pages=824–828|volume=173|issue=6|date=June 1988|doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second species in Indonesia===
[[Image:Latimeria menadoensis.jpg|thumb|''Latimeria menadoensis'', Tokyo Sea Life Park (Kasai Rinkai Suizokuen), Japan]] 
On September 18, 1997, Arnaz and [[Mark V. Erdmann|Mark Erdmann]], traveling in [[Indonesia]] on their [[honeymoon]], saw a strange fish enter the market at [[Manado Tua]], on the island of [[Sulawesi]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt; Mark thought it was a ''gombessa'' (Comoro coelacanth), although it was brown, not blue. An expert noticed their pictures on the [[Internet]] and realized its significance. Subsequently, the Erdmanns contacted local fishermen and asked for any future catches of the fish to be brought to them.

A second Indonesian specimen, 1.2 m in length and weighing 29&amp;nbsp;kg, was captured alive on July 30, 1998.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt; It lived for six hours, allowing scientists to photographically document its coloration, fin movements and general behavior. The specimen was preserved and donated to the ''Museum Zoologicum [[Bogor]]iense (MZB)'', part of the ''[[Indonesian Institute of Sciences]] (LIPI)''.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;Jewett, Susan L., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/horizon/nov98/fishstory.htm "On the Trail of the Coelacanth, a Living Fossil"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 1998-11-11, Retrieved on 2007-06-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DNA]] testing revealed this specimen differed genetically from the Comorian population.&lt;ref name = Erdmann2&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Erdmann  | first = Mark V.  | title = An Account of the First Living Coelacanth known to Scientists from Indonesian Waters  | journal = Environmental Biology of Fishes  | volume =  54   | issue = #4  | pages = 439–443  | publisher = Springer Netherlands  |date=April 1999  | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/u5143r02v5u7133j/  | doi = 10.1023/A:1007584227315  | id = 0378-1909 (Print) 1573-5133 (Online) | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holder&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holder, Mark T. | author2 = Mark V.

On May 19, 2007, Justinus Lahama, an Indonesian fisherman, caught a 1.3-metre-long, 50&amp;nbsp;kg/110 pound coelacanth off the coast near Manado, on northern Sulawesi Island near Bunaken National Marine Park. After spending 30 minutes out of water, the fish, still alive, was placed in a netted pool in front of a restaurant at the edge of the sea. It survived for 17 hours. Coelacanths usually live at depths of 200-1,000 metres. The fish was filmed by local authorities swimming in the metre-deep pool, then frozen after it died. AFP claim French, Japanese and Indonesian scientists working with the French Institute for Development and Research carried out a [[necropsy]] on the coelacanth with genetic analysis to follow.
The local university is now studying the carcass.&lt;ref name="CNN1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/1504 "Ancient Indonesian fish is 'living fossil'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205005414/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/1504 |date=2008-12-05 }}, ''Cosmos Online'', 2007-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===iSimangaliso Wetland Park in South Africa===
In [[South Africa]], the search continued on and off over the years.  A 46-year-old diver, Rehan Bouwer, lost his life searching for coelacanths in June 1998.

On 28 October 2000, just south of the [[Mozambique]] border in [[Sodwana Bay]] in the [[Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park|St. Lucia Marine Protected Area]], three deep-water divers, Pieter Venter, Peter Timm, and Etienne le Roux, made a dive to 104 metres and unexpectedly spotted a coelacanth.

Calling themselves "SA Coelacanth Expedition 2000", the group returned with photographic equipment and several additional members.  On 27 November, after an unsuccessful initial dive the previous day, four members of the group, Pieter Venter, Gilbert Gunn, Christo Serfontein, and Dennis Harding, found three coelacanths.  The largest was between 1.5 and 1.8 metres in length; the other two were from 1.0 to 1.2 metres.  The fish swam head-down and appeared to be feeding from the cavern ledges.  The group returned with video footage and photographs of the coelacanths.

During the dive, however, Serfontein lost consciousness, and 34-year-old Dennis Harding rose to the surface with him in an uncontrolled ascent.  Harding complained of neck pains and died from a [[cerebral embolism]] while on the boat.  Serfontein recovered after being taken underwater for [[decompression sickness]] treatment.

In March–April 2002, the Jago Submersible and Fricke Dive Team descended into the depths off Sodwana and observed 15 coelacanths.  A [[dart probe]] was used to collect tissue samples.

===Tanzania===
Coelacanths have been caught off the coast of [[Tanzania]] since 2004. Two coelacanths were initially reported captured off Songa Mnara, a small island off the edge of the [[Indian Ocean]] in August 2003. A spate of 19 more specimens of these extremely rare fishes weighing between 25 and 80&amp;nbsp;kg were reported netted in the space of the next five months, with another specimen captured in January 2005. A coelacanth weighing as much as 110&amp;nbsp;kg was reported by [[the Observer]] newspaper in 2006.

Officials of the Tanga Coastal Zone Conservation and Development Programme, which has a long-term strategy for protecting the species, see a connection with the timing of the captures with [[trawling]] - especially by  [[Japan]]ese vessels - near the coelacanth's habitat, as within a couple of days of [[Commercial trawler|trawlers]] casting their nets, coelacanths have turned up in deep-water [[gill net]]s intended for [[shark]]s. The sudden appearance of the coelacanths off Tanzania has raised real worries about its future due to damage done to the coelacanth population by the effects of indiscriminate trawling methods and habitat damage.&lt;ref name="tanzania1"&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,16937,1681745,00.html "Dinosaur fish pushed to the brink by deep-sea trawlers"], ''[[The Observer]]'', 2006-01-08, Retrieved on 2007-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hassan Kolombo, a programme co-ordinator, said, "Once we do not have trawlers, we don't get the coelacanths, it's as simple as that." His colleague, Solomon Makoloweka, said they had been pressuring the Tanzanian government to limit trawlers' activities. He said, "I suppose we should be grateful to these trawlers, because they have revealed this amazing and unique fish population. But we are concerned they could destroy these precious things. We want the government to limit their activity and to help fund a proper research program so that we can learn more about the coelacanths and protect them."&lt;ref name="tanzania1"/&gt;

In a March 2008 report,&lt;ref name="tanzania2"&gt;[http://www.tnrf.org/node/7066 "Does Tanga need a new harbour at Mwambani Bay?"], ''[[Tanzania Natural Resource Forum]]'', 2008-03-05, Retrieved on 2009-02-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  the Tanzania Natural Resource Forum, a local environmental nongovernmental organization, warned that a proposed port project at [[Mwambani Bay]] could threaten a coastal population of coelacanth.&lt;ref name="tanzania3"&gt;[http://news.mongabay.com/2009/0225-coelacanth.html "Population of prehistoric deep-ocean coelacanth may go the way of the dinosaurs"], ''[[mongabay.com]]'', 2009-02-25, Retrieved on 2009-02-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lopo Soares de Albergaria''' (c. 1460 in [[Lisbon]] – c. 1520 in [[Torres Vedras]]) was the second [[List of colonial heads of Portuguese India|Governor]] of [[Portuguese India]], having reached India in 1515 to supersede governor [[Afonso de Albuquerque]].

Lopo Soares de Albergaria (sometimes called Lopo Soares de Alvarenga, or simply Lopo Soares) was a middling noble, well-connected to the powerful [[Count of Abrantes|Almeida family]].  Lopo Soares had served a successful term (1495–99) as captain-general of [[Elmina|São Jorge da Mina]] in the [[Portuguese Gold Coast]] (West Africa).

In 1504, Lopo Soares commanded the [[6th Portuguese India Armada (Albergaria, 1504)|6th Portuguese India Armada]]. Regarded as  one of the more successful early India armadas, Lopo Soares brought the fleet back in 1505 nearly intact, with one of the best cargos yet received by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].  This placed him in a good position for future preferment and appointments.

In March 1515 Lopo Soares de Albergaria was chosen by king [[Manuel I of Portugal]] to supersede governor [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], and departed from Lisbon to India on 7 April. The seventeen ship fleet transported also an embassy to the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] with Portuguese ambassador Duarte Galvão, Ethiopian ambassador [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Mateus (also known as Matthew the Armenian)]] and father [[Francisco Álvares]]. In August, having  learned through contacts in Venice that the Mamluk Sultan of Cairo had prepared a fleet at Suez to fight the Portuguese,  king Manuel repented to have replaced Albuquerque, and immediately wrote to Albergaria to return the command of all operations to Albuquerque, and provide him with resources to fight. However, when the letter arrived, Albuquerque had already died.&lt;ref&gt;Albuquerque, Brás de (1774). [https://books.google.com/books?id=R2YWhpecZEQC&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=king%20manuel%20repent%20Albuquerque&amp;pg=PA200#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Commentarios do grande Afonso Dalboquerque, parte IV"], p.200-206&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portuguese attack on Jiddah 1517.jpg|thumb|left|The Ottoman admiral [[Selman Reis]] defended [[Jeddah]] against the Portuguese attack in 1517.]]
As governor in India Albergaria made a naval expedition into the [[Red Sea]] in 1517 taking on board the embassy to emperor [[Dawit II of Ethiopia]], including Mateus,  Duarte Galvão and Francisco Álvares, with the intent of landing them on the coast. First Albergaria reached [[Aden]], which offered to surrender but he felt he could not spare the men to garrison the port.&lt;ref&gt;E. Denison Ross, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/715368 "Early Travellers in Abyssinia: Part I", ''Journal of the Royal African Society'', 21 (1922), p.276]&lt;/ref&gt; The attempt to land the embassy by reaching the port of [[Massawa]] failed, with Albergaria getting no closer than the [[Dahlak Archipelago]], and was aborted after the death of old Duarte Galvão at [[Kamaran]]. Álvares and Mateus were forced to wait until Albergaria's replacement, [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]], successfully sent the embassy under D. [[Rodrigo de Lima]] in 1520.

In 1518 Lopo Soares de Albergaria captured [[Portuguese Ceylon|Ceylon]] for his king, having landed at [[Colombo]] with a large fleet. Here he ordered the construction of a small fort named "Nossa Senhora das Virtudes" or "Santa Bárbara".

'''Shaban ul millat Ali Murtaza bayabani ''' was also known as  Mahi-Shaban i Bayabani,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=qjJmzdJFOHwC&amp;pg=PA548&amp;lpg=PA548&amp;dq=shaykh+Taqi+jhusi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XgnT-YYpSv&amp;sig=4xsFyl4zRW26huIdTggvwahzdmo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB_cDy47fSAhXIU7wKHa3UARw4ChDoAQg3MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=shaykh%20Taqi%20jhusi&amp;f=false Dictionary of Indo-Persian Literature Page 548]&lt;/ref&gt; was a Sufi born at Bhakkar, Sind, on '''24 Shaban 630 H''' [in 660/1261 AD according to the Tahrir al mu'taqid].&lt;ref&gt;[Persian Literature: A Bio-Bibliographical Survey, Volume 1, Part 2 page 946]&lt;/ref&gt; He was Bhaakri Syed and wali (Friend of Allah by birth) and appointed as Abdal by his father in his early age. He traveled at the age of thirty to Multan, whence he moved successively to Bihar, Shaikhpura (India) and finally to the neighbourhood of Allahabad, (India) where large numbers of people became his followers and accepted the Islam. He stayed there and made it the seat of spirituality and knowledge.

He died on 3 or 13 Dhul Hijjah 760/ 26 October or 5 Nov 1359 AD [at jhunsi according to tahrir al mutaqid] and His Shrine was located in Jhunsi Allahabad.

==Early life==
Shaban ul millat Ali Murtaza was born on 24 Shaban 630 H  660/1261 AD at bhakkar and his father name is Sayyid Shah Badruddin badr e-alam [according to the Tahrir al mu'taqid]. He was descendant of Ali. In his late twenties he started his journey in search of spiritual master and went to many places including Multan where he met with Shams-uddin[detail] and requested to make him his disciple. On hearing this Shamsuddin replied that i don't have your destiny i teaches jazb where as in your destiny there a Wilaya. He instructed shaban ul millat to go and meet [[Rukn-e-Alam|Makhdoom Ruknuddin abu al fatah]].&lt;ref&gt;Manba Al ansab Urdu Translation by Allama Dr. Sahil on page 318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Manba Al-Ansab]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.slideshare.net/syedshibli11/mamba-ul-ansab-urdu-high-quality-pdf Manba al Ansab-pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manba Al-Ansab|Manba Al-ansab]]

Shaban ul millat presented himself in the service of Makhdoom Ruknuddin abu al-fatah and stayed there with makhdoom Ruknuddin abu al fatah bin shah sadr-uddin bin [[Baha-ud-din Zakariya|Makhdoom Bahauddin Zakariya Multani]]&lt;ref&gt;[Baran-e-Rahmat - The Rain of Mercy Part 2 page 163]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=BnQCDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=bahauddin+zakariya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT58z85brSAhWJr48KHSfHB6QQ6AEIMjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=bahauddin%20zakariya&amp;f=false Baran-e-Rahmat google books]&lt;/ref&gt; for two years. He wanted from makhdoom Ruknuddin to takes is bayt (oath) but makhdomm Ruknuddin replied that your destiny is in Bihar (India) go there and give the bayt to Makhdoom minhajuddin Haji harmain.&lt;ref&gt;Patna University Journal - Volume 8 - Page 14&lt;/ref&gt;
Shaban ul millat ali murtaza departed from multan and went bihar where he gives his bayt to Makhdoom haji harmain and became the Sufi of Soharwardi order. He passed on 3 or 13 Dhul Hijjah 760/ 26 October or 5 Nov 1359[at jhunsi according to tahrir al mutaqid]. His Shrine was located in [[Jhusi|Jhunsi]] Allahabad.

'''March Kong Fong Eu''' ({{zh|c=余江月桂|j=Jyu4 Gong1 Jyut6 Gwai3|p=Yú Jiāng Yuèguì}}; March 29, 1922 – December 21, 2017) was a Chinese-American politician. She was a member of the [[California State Assembly]] and went on to serve as [[Secretary of State of California]].

==Early life and education==
Eu was born in [[Oakdale, California]] in the [[San Joaquin Valley]], where her Chinese immigrant parents ran a hand-wash laundry. The family later moved to [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-march-fong-eu-20171222-story.html|title=March Fong Eu, pioneering Asian American politician who was longtime California secretary of state, dies at 95|last=Luther|first=Claudia|date=December 22, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eu earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[dentistry]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1943 and a [[Master of Arts]] from [[Mills College]]. She earned a [[Doctor of Education|Ed.D.]] from the [[Stanford Graduate School of Education]] in 1954.

==Career==
She became a [[dental hygienist]] and served a term as president of the American Dental Hygienist Association. In the 1950s she served on the Alameda County School Board.&lt;ref name = "LAT"/&gt;

===California Assembly===
In 1966 Eu was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[California State Assembly]] from the 15th District, representing [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Castro Valley, California|Castro Valley]]. She served four terms. She is best known for her successful campaign to ban pay toilets, arguing that they discriminated against women since urinals were free.&lt;ref name = "info" /&gt;

===California Secretary of State===
Eu was elected [[Secretary of State of California]] in 1974, becoming the first [[Asian American]] woman ever elected to a [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutional]] office in the United States.&lt;ref name = "info" /&gt; She remained the only woman to serve as California Secretary of State until 2006, when voters elected [[Debra Bowen]]. Eu was elected Secretary of State five times.  In 1978 she won every county in the state, even heavily [[Republican (United States)|Republican]] [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], making her one of only five  Democrats to win the county in a statewide race in the last half century. She resigned in 1994 when President Bill Clinton nominated her for an ambassadorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-11/news/mn-21734_1_march-fong-eu|title=March Fong Eu Quits as Secretary of State|last=Gillam|first=Jerry|date=February 11, 1994|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovations she introduced during her 20 years as Secretary of State included voter registration by mail; providing absentee ballots to anyone who requested them; posting results on the Internet; and including candidate statements in ballot pamphlets.&lt;ref name = "ocr"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/mail-45569-election-results.html|title=O.C. resident March Fong Eu left legacy of change for elections|last=Giasone|first=Barbara|date=November 4, 2006|work=Orange County Register|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, she became the first woman to serve as [[Governor of California]], serving as acting governor while Governor [[Jerry Brown]] was out of the state.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5634411&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other political activities===
In 1987 Eu was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate, running against [[Leo McCarthy]] for the right to challenge the Republican incumbent, [[Pete Wilson]]. Amid poor fund-raising totals and her husband's unwillingness to release details of his business interests, Eu dropped out later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-29/news/mn-17495_1_senate-race | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Eu Drops Out of Senate Race | date=29 October 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] appointed Eu as [[United States Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia]] in 1994. She served in that post until 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/eu-march-fong|title=Office of the Historian|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Eu, then age 79, ran again for Secretary of State, saying she was doing so because "Florida made me mad", referring to the [[Florida election recount|voting problems in Florida]] during the [[United States presidential election, 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Florida-Made-Her-Mad-At-79-March-Fong-Eu-wants-2942518.php|title=Florida Made Her Mad / At 79, March Fong Eu wants to run California elections again|last=Salladay|first=Robert|date=March 14, 2001|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She narrowly lost in the Democratic [[Primary election|primary]] to [[Kevin Shelley]], who went on to win the election. In 2003 she filed a statement of intention to run for [[governor of California]] in the [[California gubernatorial recall election, 2003|gubernatorial recall election]] of [[Gray Davis]], but later withdrew.

==Later life and family==
Eu resided both in California and Singapore with her second husband Henry Eu, a multimillionaire industrialist.&lt;ref name = "LAT"/&gt; Her adopted son, [[Matt Fong]], was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] activist who served as [[California State Treasurer]] for a four-year term that began January 1995.&lt;ref name = "info"&gt;{{cite web|title=March Fong Eu|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0880736.html|work=infoplease.com|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also had a daughter, Suyin. Her hobbies in retirement included Chinese brush painting and calligraphy.&lt;ref name = "ocr" /&gt; Eu died on December 21, 2017, at age 95, following a fall.&lt;ref name = "LAT"/&gt;

==Recognition==
The [[National Notary Association]] gives an annual March Fong Eu Award to "the individual who or organization that, in the judgment of the Association’s Executive Committee, has done the most to improve the standards, image and quality of the office of Notary Public." Eu was the first recipient of the award in 1979, named after her "for her extraordinary leadership in spearheading enactment of progressive Notary reform legislation, despite opposition from powerful lobbies who preferred lower notarial standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalnotary.org/about-the-nna/award-programs|title=Award Programs|work=National Notary Association|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Number Six''' is a family of [[fictional character]]s from the reimagined [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. She is portrayed by Canadian actress and model [[Tricia Helfer]]. Of the twelve known [[Cylon (re-imagining)|Cylon]] models, she is the sixth of the "Significant Seven". Like the others of the "Significant Seven", there are several versions of her, including Caprica-Six, Shelly Godfrey, [[Gina Inviere]], Natalie Faust, Lida, and Sonja. She is the only model that does not use one particular human alias for all copies.&lt;ref&gt;Although two of the Number Eights have been individuated by different military callsigns, and the marriage of one of them, they began with the same alias, Sharon Valerii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The character was named after [[Number Six (The Prisoner)|Number Six]], [[Patrick McGoohan]]'s character from the show ''[[The Prisoner]]''.&lt;ref name="Companion"&gt;''Battlestar Galactica: The Official Companion''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and personality traits==
Six is a seductive, statuesque Cylon infiltrator. She was the first example shown of a new generation of Cylons capable of adapting to human form and emotions. Little else is known of her earlier years. She can, like other Cylons, retain memories which can be downloaded into another body if the original body is killed. Like her counterparts, her body was designed to mimic the human body at the cellular level, making her almost undetectable to testing procedures, and there are many copies of her in existence. Sixes and [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Eight]]s are the Humanoid Cylon models shown most frequently. Sixes tend to have individualistic traits, and are considerably susceptible to the full array of human emotions. Although extremely effective and adaptive, Sixes always show certain disdain for their given chores and dislike being treated as expendable. Most versions of Six have platinum-blonde hair, including Caprica-Six, Shelly Godfrey and Sonja. Others such as Gina Inviere, Natalie Faust and Lida have honey-blonde hair, and one Six with black hair has been observed.

It was stated by ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'' showrunner [[Kevin Murphy (screenwriter)|Kevin Murphy]] that had the prequel series ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'' continued, it would be revealed that the Sixes' default personality was modeled after that of [[Zoe Graystone]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Murphy (screenwriter)|Kevin Murphy]] in [http://www.capricatimes.com/the-caprica-times-exclusive-interview-kevin-murphy ''The Caprica Times Exclusive Interview: Kevin Murphy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504135715/http://www.capricatimes.com:80/the-caprica-times-exclusive-interview-kevin-murphy |date=2011-05-04 }} 2011-04-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Since her debut in the mini-series, a [[leitmotif]] has been used in scenes featuring Tricia Helfer as Six. This simple 9-note motif was composed by [[Richard Gibbs]]. The [[time signature|9/8]] figure is divided unevenly into a group of 3 notes, followed by 3 groups of 2. It is almost always performed on a [[gamelan]], and also plays over the introduction to each episode of the series. On the published series soundtrack, the melody is listed as ''The Sense of Six''.

==Versions==
Copies of Number Six appear regularly, mostly within Cylon society. Several notable versions have had more prominent roles:

===Caprica Six===
At the beginning of the miniseries, a Six copy&lt;ref&gt;The name of this copy is never given. While the novelization of the miniseries gives her name as Natasi, the book is not considered [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. No name was ever given by the producers. [[Ronald D. Moore]] stated in a [http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Podcast:The_Battlestar_Roundtable special podcast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223732/http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Podcast:The_Battlestar_Roundtable |date=2007-09-26 }} that the idea is that Baltar simply never bothered to learn her name, which is supported by [[David Eick]] {{cite web |url=http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Ausiello-Report/Galactica-Exec-Spills/700002601 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016163558/http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Ausiello-Report/Galactica-Exec-Spills/700002601 |archivedate=2007-10-16 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; is involved in an intense affair with Dr. [[Gaius Baltar]]. Pretending to be an employee of a computer corporation, Six seduces Baltar while helping him with his work on the Colonial Defense System. After infiltrating the mainframe, Six  reveals her true nature to Baltar. Just a few hours before the intended Cylon attack, she  informs him that the Cylons will use the computer [[Password|access code]] that he has given her to infiltrate the highest levels of Colonial defense systems; thereby disabling the Colonial military, and attacking the Twelve Colonies. That same day, the Cylons launch their multi-targeted attack and destroy most of humanity. Six uses her body to shield Baltar from a nuclear blast during the attack, saving his life and sacrificing hers.&lt;ref name="lat090319"&gt;{{cite news | author = Phillips, Jevon | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/03/battlestar-ga-4.html | title = 'Battlestar Galactica' finale: interview with Ron Moore | date = 2009-03-19 | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode "[[Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)|Downloaded]]", this Six copy is downloaded into a new body. Nicknamed "Caprica Six" by fellow Cylons, she is viewed as a [[hero]] within the Cylon [[civilization]] for her complete success in her mission to compromise the colonies' defenses. She is surprised to discover she has 'emotions' and expresses a degree of [[regret]] at her actions, as evidenced by her constant visions of Baltar. This "Head Baltar" acts as a critical counselor and manipulator to her in the same way Head Six does for the real Baltar. Caprica Six is enlisted to motivate the resurrected ''Galactica'' copy of [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Sharon "Boomer" Valerii]] to move out of her apartment and reintegrate into Cylon society. However, in defiance of their superiors, both Caprica Six and Sharon opt instead to aid [[Samuel Anders]], to the extent that Caprica Six murders a [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Three]] to save him. Allowed by the ''[[John Cavil|Caprica]]'' Cavil, Caprica Six and Sharon then begin preaching peace with the humans as the way of God. This leads them to take over Cylon culture and to resume the hunt for humanity, leading them to the colony of New Caprica, which they take over in a bloodless coup facilitated by Baltar, who surrenders to Caprica Six as soon as the Cylons arrive.

After the Cylon occupation of New Caprica, Caprica Six alienates the other Cylons with her desire for peaceful coexistence with humans. Her reunion with the real Baltar, however, shatters her illusions about her former pawn, as Baltar impotently allows the Cylons to bully him into enacting their oppressive tyranny upon New Caprica. The other Cylons insist Baltar must sign an execution order for 200 insurgents in response to two suicide bombings by the human resistance movement. Baltar initially refuses and Caprica Six alone objects strongly to her fellow Cylons' desire for mortal retribution. These objections result in her being shot in the head by fellow Cylon, [[Number Five (Battlestar Galactica)|Aaron Doral]]. Her death and an immediate threat to shoot Baltar force him to sign the order. Caprica Six is reborn and helps Baltar escape onto a Cylon Basestar when New Caprica is ultimately abandoned by its population.

After settling on the basestar, Caprica Six becomes involved in a [[ménage à trois]] with Baltar and [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Biers]] and explicitly states she loves both of them. She was also instrumental in rescuing an inexplicably sick [[Hera Agathon|Hera]] from the Basestar. She assists in Athena's download and witnesses the obvious bond between Athena and Hera. Caprica subsequently disables and then kills Boomer who threatens to throttle Hera despite Athena's anguished pleas. She leads Athena and her child to a captured Raptor and returns with them to ''Galactica'', where she is promptly imprisoned. In this situation she is frequently used as a source of information about and means of understanding the Cylon's motivations.

[[Saul Tigh|Colonel Saul Tigh]] begins to make more frequent stops to her cell, questioning her about what it's like to exist as a Cylon. He confronts her about being responsible for the deaths of billions and whether she feels any remorse or if she can just 'flip a switch' and shut out the pain. Caprica Six questions Tigh's reasons for the line of questioning, unaware Tigh is one of the Five Unrevealed Cylon Models. When she goads him about needing to feel pain, he turns to leave but she assaults him and bludgeons him. To her surprise he cries and begs for more pain, but in response she abruptly aborts her assault, shakes her head and replies he doesn't need any more pain. She then kisses him passionately.

[[Dr. Cottle]] later reveals Caprica Six is pregnant.  It is revealed Tigh is the father of the baby. After it is revealed Tigh is one of the 'Final Five' Cylons, Caprica Six's relationship with Tigh changes. The significance of her pregnancy increases as the child will not be a human-Cylon hybrid, but will be a pure Cylon offspring. Caprica Six begins to live with Tigh in his quarters on Galactica and the two now share a very intimate and caring relationship. However, when [[Ellen Tigh]] returns, she, Tigh and Caprica Six fight about whom Tigh really loves, and Caprica Six loses the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title =Deadlock | episodelink =Deadlock (Battlestar Galactica) | series =Battlestar Galactica | serieslink =Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) | airdate =2009-02-20 | season =4 | number =18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She joins the rescue mission for Hera and is finally proud of Baltar, something she had always wanted and feels was the one thing missing between the two of them. They both see Head Six and Head Baltar and are shocked the other sees them. The two defend ''Galactica'' against Cylon boarders and take Hera when they find her wandering alone. Caprica Six holds a gun on Cavil during the standoff over Hera and hands him the phone when the deal is made. Later, on Earth, she and Baltar are visited one last time by Head Six and Head Baltar, who explain their destiny was to protect Hera and while God's plan is never over, their lives will be much less eventful. Caprica Six and Baltar then go off to start new lives as farmers together.

Ronald D. Moore has stated that Baltar never bothered to learn her name. In season two she is, in one scene, called "Sara". In the season finale, there's a flashback scene on Caprica in which Gaius tells her "he has forgotten her name." The non-canon novelization of the miniseries by Jeffrey A. Carver suggests Caprica Six went by the name Natasi.

===Head/Inner/Messenger Six===
A distinct copy derived from Caprica Six residing in Baltar's head since the destruction of the colonies, "Head Six" appears as a figment of his imagination, invisible to everyone else. She suggests this phenomenon might be caused by either a computer chip implant or insanity over his guilt. When Baltar undergoes an [[MRI]]-like "brain scan", it reveals no sign of a computer chip or any other foreign object in his brain. While this briefly leads Baltar to think he has truly gone insane, he concludes this is impossible, given Six's knowledge of events unknown to him (for example, the prediction of the birth of the Human/Cylon Hybrid to [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Sharon Agathon]] while a prisoner aboard ''Galactica''). Confronted with this in Part II of "[[Home (Battlestar Galactica)|Home]]", Six declares that she is neither a computer chip ''nor'' a hallucination produced by mental instability. When Baltar then asks just who or what she is, she simply replies she is "an angel of God sent here to protect you, to guide you and to love you." She repeats this claim in the episode "[[Torn (Battlestar Galactica)|Torn]]".

This Six often appears suddenly, without warning. She often advises and gives instructions to Baltar. While she usually appears to him as part of the real world, occasionally he interacts with her in an imagined but persistent dream-like setting within his mind.

While Six can physically interact with Baltar in his imagination, it is for most of the series unclear if she is able to physically affect him in the real world — this is finally resolved in the episode "[[Escape Velocity (Battlestar Galactica)|Escape Velocity]]", where Head Six is shown lifting Baltar from the floor to a standing position after he endured repeated blows from a ''Galactica'' marine.

This manifestation of Six in particular is extremely religious. In contrast to the colonists, and like the other Cylons, she believes in a singular [[monotheism|god]], whom she identifies as Love. She constantly attempts to convince Baltar to believe in the Cylon god, and to accept his part in God's plan or will.

Her motivations are unclear. While some of her advice appears to benefit humanity, for example, pointing out a Cylon device to Baltar on ''Galactica'' and helping him build a Cylon detector, it more often serves only Baltar's needs, and she expresses enjoyment over what she considers the inevitable extinction of the human race, constantly saying humanity is naturally violent and would have destroyed itself without the Cylons' intervention.

Head Six appears to be somehow related to Caprica Six, which is the Six model who seduced Baltar on the planet Caprica and encouraged him to give her access to the Colonial Defense mainframe. This belief is supported by the fact that Caprica Six has her own Head Baltar, implying some sort of transcendental connection between those two specific characters. Nonetheless, once the audience is re-introduced to Caprica Six, it becomes clear that something more unusual is going on, since Caprica Six and Baltar bear little resemblance in personality to their internal counterparts.

Head Six is seen less frequently following the departure from New Caprica. In her brief appearances in the first part of season 4, Baltar begins to refer to her as an angel.

In the final episode of the series, it is made clear that, like the [[Kara Thrace|Starbuck]] [[Avatar]], Head Six is indeed an agent of a higher power as she claims, not a chip or a delusion inside Baltar's head. She and Head Baltar are the last-seen characters in the final moment of the episode, which takes place 150,000 years after the rest of the series.  Their role as angel-like beings was to guide Baltar and Caprica Six in protecting Hera, and once that task is done, they leave them alone.  She and Head Baltar speculate on whether the cycle will continue (recalling the theme of "all of this has happened before and all of this will happen again"); Head Six reveals that her excitement over humanity's potential extinction was a ruse and states her belief that  the cycle has finally been broken.

Although the name is not used by characters in the context of the story, Executive Producer Ronald D. Moore revealed in his official SciFi BSG podcasts "Head Six" is the designation given to the character in scripts and production documents.  In discussions of the final episode, Moore also calls this version Inner Six who, along with Inner Baltar, are "... messenger(s) of a higher power",&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald D. Moore]] in [http://video.scifi.com/player/?id=1063661#videoid=1063714 ''Battlestar Galactica: The Last Frakkin' Special''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322022716/http://video.scifi.com/player/?id=1063661 |date=2009-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reinforcing the variations "Head Six", "Inner Six" and "Messenger Six" (or Head/Inner/Messenger Baltar) used by fans to describe these characters.

Although in Season 2 Episode 6 "Home" Gaius Baltar refers to Head Six as "Sara" when in the holding cell designed for Sharon Valerii earlier in the season. Whether this was an unauthorized ad lib by the actor or perhaps it was what he calls her is unclear as she is never referred to by name again &lt;ref&gt;closed caption text during episode http://forums.syfy.com/index.php?app=core&amp;module=attach&amp;section=attach&amp;attach_rel_module=post&amp;attach_id=9439&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shelly Godfrey===
In the episode "Six Degrees of Separation", a copy of Number Six in the fleet using the name "Shelly Godfrey" appears. Godfrey attempts to frame Baltar for betraying the human race with supposed photographic evidence. In addition, she attempts to seduce [[William Adama|Commander Adama]]. She disappears abruptly after her "photographic evidence" is proven to be fake. This leads the people of the fleet to conclude she was a Cylon agent trying to discredit Dr. Baltar because of his Cylon detector research. Baltar's popularity increases as a result. [[Felix Gaeta]] notes that once the photo was resolved, identifying it as a fake was almost too easy, "like she wanted to be found out." As her appearance coincided with the temporary disappearance of Head Six, it is often wondered (and indeed voiced by Baltar himself) whether she was a physical manifestation of Head Six posing in a dual identity.

The episode does cause the audience (and Baltar) to think Shelly Godfrey is related to Head Six, however this is demonstrated to be a deliberate red herring in subsequent episodes of ''Battlestar Galactica.'' The telemovie ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan]]'' reveals that, Godfrey is indeed an actual Six. After the photo was discovered to be fake, the Number One on board Galactica who was coordinating Cylon efforts made her enter an airlock and be killed so she could download and give Galactica's coordinates to the Cylon fleet. Another Six donned a wig and clothing identical to Godfrey's in order to confuse the guards and allow Godfrey to get away from them. In the hallway, Cavil intimates that Godfrey has failed to produce convincing fake evidence because she is attracted to Baltar, and her statement that Baltar is "a brilliant man" who helped them so much on Caprica supports this, despite her protestation that Cavil should have seen her with him because "I was brutal with him. I pushed him." Later, on Cavil's bed, the other Six also notes her sister's complete destruction of the Sixes' cover and her utter failure to discredit Baltar and "his dreamy hair".

===Gina Inviere===
[[Image:Battlestar Galactica - Number Six (Gina).jpg|thumb|Gina, as she appears in Razor]]
In the episode "[[Pegasus (Battlestar Galactica)|Pegasus]]" and the telemovie ''[[Battlestar Galactica: Razor]]'', it is revealed a copy of Six had hidden aboard the [[Battlestar Pegasus|''Pegasus'']], posing as a [[civilian]] [[network administrator]] and using the name Gina Inviere (supposedly Old Gemenese for "resurrection"; in reality, ''înviere'' is [[Romanian language|Romanian]] for "resurrection".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Resurrection Resurrection - Definitions from Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) This Number Six gains the confidence of [[Helena Cain|Rear Admiral Helena Cain]], with whom she has a romantic relationship, and then-Lieutenant [[List of Battlestar Galactica characters#Kendra Shaw|Kendra Shaw]], who gives Gina the administrator codes for the ''Pegasus'' mainframe. Gina uses Shaw's password in order to disable the ''Pegasus'' during a Cylon attack, enabling the ship to be boarded by centurions. Shaw sees another Six with the centurions thereby exposing Gina as a Cylon. Gina manages to get her hands on a gun, but hesitates to shoot Cain, indicating that Gina's relationship with Cain was not an act. Gina's hesitation enables Shaw to knock her unconscious before Gina can make a decision. Cain orders her former lover's imprisonment, condemning her as a thing, and allows Gina to be subjected to [[torture]] and [[gang rape]] by members of the ''Pegasus''{{'}} crew. By the time of the events of "Pegasus", Gina appears to be [[catatonia|catatonic]] from the severe trauma of her abuse.

In "Pegasus", Baltar treats Gina's injuries and transfers his love of Caprica Six to her, causing Gina to finally start responding. In the two-part episode "[[Resurrection Ship]]," Gina comes out of her catatonic state completely and is so traumatized from her ordeal that she wishes to truly die. To this end, Gina supplies Baltar with vital intelligence on the Cylon Resurrection Ship so that the fleet can destroy it. Once the Resurrection Ship has been destroyed, Gina kills her guard and begs Baltar to kill her. Instead, Baltar releases Gina to seek justice for her torment. Gina corners her former lover Admiral Cain in her quarters and kills her in revenge before escaping from the ''Pegasus''. She then joins a group of Cylon sympathizers, who want humanity to make peace with the Cylons. The extensive sexual abuse she has suffered renders Gina psychologically unable to be intimate with Baltar until shortly before her death.

In the finale of the second season, Gina detonates a nuclear weapon she had received from Dr. Baltar, killing herself, signaling the location of the human settlement to the Cylons, and destroying the ''[[Cloud 9 (Battlestar Galactica)|Cloud 9]]'' and several other ships in the human fleet. While the destruction of the Resurrection Ship in ''Resurrection Ship Part 2'' initially indicates Gina's death to be final, ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan|The Plan]]'' reveals that there was another Resurrection Ship in range shortly before Gina's death as stated by the fleet's copy of John Cavil. However, Gina does not appear to have been downloaded with the Cylons only finding New Caprica by way of detecting the signature of her nuclear detonation a year later. Presumably this second Resurrection Ship was out of range as the Cylons had chosen to stop chasing the fleet at the time due to the efforts of Boomer and Caprica Six.

Gina has honey-blonde hair, actress Tricia Helfer's natural hair color, instead of the platinum-blonde of most Sixes. Like Shelly Godfrey, she sometimes wears glasses.

Series creator Ron Moore says in the DVD commentary for "Pegasus", the name "Gina" is directly meant as a jab against critics of the reimagined series who use the derogatory term "GINO" ('''''G'''alactica'' '''''I'''''n '''''N'''''ame '''''O'''''nly) to describe it.

Gina appears briefly in one of [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon "Boomer" Valerii|Boomer]]'s flashbacks in ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan|The Plan]].'' Gina helped prep Boomer for her upcoming transition to a sleeper agent and provided IT support for her cover identity.

===Natalie Faust===
[[Image:Battlestar Galactica - Number Six (Natalie).jpg|thumb|Natalie]]
An assertive and authoritative version of Number Six named Natalie appears in the episode "[[Six of One (Battlestar Galactica)|Six of One]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Starpulse Magazine | url=http://scifipulse.net/battlestarnews/RDM_Dec_07.html | date=2007-11-06 | accessdate=2008-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a vote to lobotomize Cylon raiders in which a single copy of Number Eight (Boomer) gave the swing vote in favor of lobotomy by siding against the rest of her model, Natalie, along with the remaining Number Sixes, Eights and [[Number Two (Battlestar Galactica)|Two]]s, leads a coup against the other models. They decide to give sentience to the Cylon Centurions, making them self-aware and capable of feeling for the first time. The other models, led by Cavil, are dumbstruck by this decision and attempt to destroy Natalie and her followers permanently in the episode titled "[[The Ties That Bind (Battlestar Galactica)|The Ties That Bind]]", luring them into an ambush by pretending to acquiesce to their demands that they stop lobotomizing the Raiders, unbox the entire [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Three]] model, and use the knowledge gained by the Three known as D'Anna at the [[Temple of Five]] to identify and join with the lost "[[Final Five Cylons|Final Five]]" humanoid Cylon models. The Resurrection Ship is jumped out of range during this ambush so that the deaths suffered by the rebels are permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Ties That Bind |episodelink=The Ties That Bind (Battlestar Galactica) |series=Battlestar Galactica |serieslink=Battlestar Galactica (re-imagined)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Number Two from their damaged Baseship, [[Leoben Conoy]], takes a Heavy Raider and manages to make contact with Lieutenant [[Kara Thrace|Kara "Starbuck" Thrace]] and her crew on the ''Demetrius,'' a sewage processing vessel repurposed for long-range exploration in the episode "[[The Road Less Traveled (Battlestar Galactica)|The Road Less Traveled]]". Conoy offers an alliance between the rebel Cylons and the Colonials. In the episode "[[Faith (Battlestar Galactica)|Faith]]", Conoy, Thrace and some of the ''Demetrius'' crew take a [[Colonial Raptor]] to the rebel Basestar and make repairs, allowing the Baseship – the ''Demetrius'' following behind – to jump to the Colonial fleet in the episode "[[Guess What's Coming to Dinner]]", in which Natalie makes a deal with Rear Admiral Adama on the ''Galactica'' to reveal the location of the main Cylon Resurrection Hub and help the Colonials destroy it, ending resurrection for the enemy Cylons, as long as she can bring the "Final Five" with her off the ''Galactica'' after Earth is located. And so a tenuous alliance is formed. Natalie is on her way to speak to Adama again when she encounters the human-Cylon hybrid infant Hera Agathon in the corridor and bends down to talk to her. Natalie is then confronted and shot by Hera's mother [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon "Athena" Agathon|Sharon "Athena" Agathon]], the Number Eight who left the Cylons, married [[Karl Agathon|Karl "Helo" Agathon]] and joined ''Galactica'''s crew, because of a dream Athena had in which a Number Six took her daughter. Somehow the rebel Basestar's hybrid detects her shooting and panics, causing the ship to jump away. Near the beginning of the episode "[[Sine Qua Non (Battlestar Galactica)|Sine Qua Non]]", Natalie is taken to the ''Galactica'' infirmary for treatment where she dies of her injuries. As Natalie dies, she projects a forest scene, a favorite projection of Number Six model. Doctor Cottle also holds Natalie's hand as she dies in an act of kindness for the mortally wounded woman. With no Resurrection Ship in range, her death is permanent.

Her surname is not used onscreen and her first name is only used once, by a Number Eight in the episode "[[The Hub (Battlestar Galactica)|The Hub]]", who notes that the Hybrid of their Baseship has reacted to Natalie being killed or injured on ''Galactica.'' Nor is her backstory elaborated on. [[Michael Angeli]]'s original version of the script for the episode "Six of One" has John Cavil refer to Natalie Faust by her full name and mention that she infiltrated Gemenon posing as a political reform advocate. During the Cylon attack, she was responsible for relaying the coordinates of all the Gemenese leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leethomson.myzen.co.uk/Battlestar_Galactica/Battlestar_Galactica_4x04_-_Six_of_One.pdf Original script for "Six of One" by Michael Angeli]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sonja===

A copy named Sonja who has been elected to represent the Cylons in the Quorum. Sonja has taken over Natalie's place as the leader of the rebel faction of cyclons. Sonja's appearance is that of a typical Six. In her first act as the cyclon leader she requests that Roslin and Adama hand over [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon .22Boomer.22 Valerii|Boomer]] in order to try her for treason against the Cylons.&lt;ref name=sonia&gt;{{cite news | author = Alan Sepinwall | url = http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/02/battlestar_galactica_someone_t.html | title = Battlestar Galactica, "Someone to Watch Over Me": Shoot the piano player | date = 2009-02-28 | work = [[The Star-Ledger]] | accessdate = 2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is later seen at a meeting of the new Quorum of Ships' Captains, representing the rebel Basestar, as they discuss the impending transfer of Admiral William Adama's command from the aging Galactica to the Basestar. And in the series finale she is seen along with a two and an eight discussing their plan with Adama on how to populate the new Earth saying that they'll stay alongside the humans in their new home until their own deaths come.

==="Tough Six"===
A brunette Six with blonde streaks appears in ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan]]''.  She had been a [[prostitute]] on the Colonies, and eventually drunkenly mocks [[John Cavil]]'s schemes while sharing a bed with him, following the not-quite-fatal shooting of Commander Adama by Cylon sleeper agent [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon "Boomer" Valerii|Boomer]] and the suicide of their fellow infiltrator [[Number Four (Battlestar Galactica)#The Fleet|Simon O'Neill]], a Number Four. She points out that most of the Cylons' failings, including those mentioned above, along with Number Two [[Leoben Conoy]]'s interaction with Lieutenant [[Kara Thrace|Kara "Starbuck" Thrace]] and Shelly Godfrey's failure to ruin Gaius Baltar, have been due to love, and leaves the room telling Cavil that "you can't declare war on love". She typically wears chains-and-leather clothing and has been seen to chew bubblegum during a Cylon meeting in Cavil's chapel, sitting next to Godfrey, who has platinum hair and wears glasses and a sensible blouse and skirt. Cavil notes that the Sixes have done a good job of distinguishing themselves and praises Godfrey for it, in contrast to the Number Five/Aaron Doral copy who has individuated himself from the copy abandoned on Ragnar only by wearing a teal suit instead of a burgundy one, in the same cut.

This Six, not given a name onscreen but referred to as "Tough Six" in the shooting script, was instrumental in the mysterious disappearance of Ms. Shelly Godfrey from ''Galactica'', using a wig and a change of clothes to imitate Godfrey's appearance and confuse the marines who were tailing her, making them think that Godfrey had gotten further ahead of them when the real Godfrey was pulled into another corridor by John Cavil. Godfrey and Cavil then slipped away and Cavil airlocked Godfrey, while the marines were chasing Tough Six, who evaded them. The ultimate fate of Tough Six is unknown, whether she was captured and executed or remained in the fleet until New Caprica, as she is not seen in ''The Plan'' following her exit from Cavil's bedroom and did not appear in regular episodes.

===Other versions===
Number Sixes have been shown in a variety of roles, including repairing the Galactica ("[[Deadlock (Battlestar Galactica)|Deadlock]]" and "[[Someone to Watch Over Me (Battlestar Galactica)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]"), hospital administration ("[[The Farm (Battlestar Galactica)|The Farm]]"), serving as Heavy Raider pilots, and as rebel Cylon leaders (Natalie and Sonja). Other versions include:

*A copy in a red tunic, who arrives aboard the Armistice Station and seduces the Colonial representative (otherwise known as Boxey's father) shortly before the station is destroyed. Similar copies are part of the group that board Ragnar Anchorage to rescue and debrief [[Aaron Doral]].
*A copy, wearing a white overcoat, who captures and kisses Helo before being shot by Sharon Agathon. Another white coat-wearing Six observes their escape, and another (possibly one of these two) later leads Centurion troops in pursuit of them. In "Razor", a copy in a white coat is the one seen and shot by Kendra Shaw during a Cylon boarding raid on the ''Pegasus.'' In "The Plan", another white coat wearing copy appears to be overseeing the Centurions pinning down the Colonial forces during the events of "[[Lay Down Your Burdens (Battlestar Galactica)|Lay Down Your Burdens]]." This copy communicates the Cylon-Colonial truce to the Caprica copy of John Cavil who agrees to let the human fleet know despite his model voting against it.
*A copy of Six in a black suit, who acts as "overseer" to the breeding experiment concerning [[Karl Agathon|Helo]] and [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Sharon Agathon]]. This copy or a similar one is killed by [[Kara Thrace|Starbuck]] in the Delphi Museum while retrieving the Arrow of Apollo. The copy of number Eight that would eventually become known as Sharon Agathon warned that she would soon download into a new body and lead the Cylons to their position. A copy of this type is also killed by Starbuck while escaping the Cylon farm
*Copies, clad in gold tunics, who act as "nurses" or "midwives", helping Caprica Six and Boomer through their respective resurrections.
*Two copies that take part in a meeting aboard ''Colonial One'' on New Caprica, and agree with the proposal to execute over 200 human detainees. They vote on behalf of the majority of the Number Six model (Caprica Six dissents).
*A raven-haired copy, dying from a disease aboard a basestar, whom [[Gaius Baltar|Baltar]] strangles after she hysterically accuses him of deliberately leading them to the disease-carrying beacon (perhaps in an effort to get him to kill her).
*Copies from the infected basestar that are brought aboard ''Galactica''. Along with the other captured infected Cylons, they are suffocated by Helo before the ''Galactica'' enters Cylon resurrection range to prevent the Colonials from committing genocide.
*A copy from "[[Faith (Battlestar Galactica)|Faith]]" aboard the damaged Basestar. She recognizes crew-member [[List of minor characters in Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)#Barolay.2C Jean|Jean Barolay]] as a resistance fighter from New Caprica who gagged her, threw her into a septic tank and watched her drown, an event that has left her emotionally traumatized. After Barolay tells her she'd be happy to do it again, the copy attacks and kills her. Shortly afterwards she is shot and killed by another Six copy, Natalie who does it to give the Colonials "justice" since there is no Resurrection Ship in range.
*A copy named Lida, with long brown hair, who comforts Gaius Baltar in [[Blood on the Scales]].&lt;ref name=lida&gt;{{cite news | author = Maureen Ryan | url = http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/02/battlestar-galactica-gaeta-blood-scales-angeli.html | title = Talking about 'Battlestar Galactica's' 'Blood on the Scales' with writer Michael Angeli | date = 2009-02-06 | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | accessdate = 2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Multiple Sixes are seen as pilots of [[Cylon Heavy Raider]]s working alongside Galactica pilots in [[Faith (Battlestar Galactica)|Faith]] and [[Someone to Watch Over Me (Battlestar Galactica)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]. They use "Six" as their ''de facto'' surname.&lt;ref&gt;Starbuck refers to one of her pilots as "Six" (not "''a'' Six" or "''this'' Six"), and Helo addresses one as "Six".&lt;/ref&gt;
*The "Cylon Prototype" voiced by Helfer in the last episode of ''[[Blood and Chrome]]''.

==Casting==
Tricia Helfer was cast after a strong audition, despite some initial concerns over her lack of acting experience. Director [[Michael Rymer]] explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It wasn't just the way she looked; she just has this vibe about her. Nobody gets how hard that role is, to bring the depth, the vulnerability and the mystery to essentially a robot chick."&lt;ref name="beginningoftheend"&gt;{{cite news | author = Adam B.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the other actresses who auditioned for the role were [[Melinda Clarke]]&lt;ref name="Companion" /&gt; and [[Leah Cairns]], who went on to play [[Margaret Edmondson|Racetrack]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/leahcairns/status/954906811806568451?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{Expand section|date=February 2009}}
In 2006, Tricia Helfer was awarded the [[Leo Award]] for "Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series" for her role as Number Six in the episode "[[Pegasus (Battlestar Galactica)|Pegasus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leoawards.com/2006_winners.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708014438/http://www.leoawards.com/governance.html |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on the fetus==

===Defects/ impairments===
{{globalize|section|date=December 2010}}

Between 18 and 38% of pregnant women of American women are classified as obese. However, little is known about the link between maternal obesity and [[Diabetes|diabetic]] effects in offspring. Maternal obesity is associated with increased odds of pregnancies affected by [[Congenital defect|congenital anomalies]], including [[neural tube defect]]s and [[spina bifida]].&lt;ref name=medscape&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/588085 medscape.com&gt; Maternal Obesity Increases Risk for Congenital Anomalies] By Alice Goodman. February 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The chances of having neural tube defects in the newborn of an obese woman has been shown to be twice that of a non-obese pregnant female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20060203/obesity-increases-risks-in-pregnancy|title=Obesity Increases Risks in Pregnancy|publisher=|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other anomalies that were increased among mothers with obesity included [[septal]] anomalies, [[cleft palate]], cleft lip and palate, [[anorectal atresia]], [[hydrocephaly]], and limb reduction anomalies. Babies are also more likely to be admitted to [[neonatal intensive care unit]]s because of effects from the obese mother. Each year, nearly 2,500 babies are born{{Where|date=July 2011}} with these defects, and many other affected pregnancies end in [[miscarriage]] and [[stillbirth]].&lt;ref name=medscape/&gt;

===Mental or physical effects on the fetus===
Maternal obesity is linked with [[elective preterm delivery]], [[Infant mortality|neonatal death]], and delivery of an extremely low birth weight infant. In follow-up studies of babies whose birth weights were below 1000g, it was shown that 40% to 45% of the survivors had severe neurodevelopmental impairments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/AJPH.2005.074294v1.pd|title=American Public Health Association - American Journal of Public Health|publisher=|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been demonstrated through a study on rats that when a pregnant mother ate a diet rich in fat, sugar, and salt, that mother's offspring was more likely to overeat and have a preference for [[junk food]]. Even when the offspring were not given the option of junk food, their bodies metabolized food differently from offspring whose mother ate healthier. Offspring of mothers who ate badly had higher levels of [[cholesterol]] and [[triglyceride]]s in their bloodstream and higher risk of heart disease. In addition, these offspring had higher levels of glucose and insulin, which indicate development of [[type 2 diabetes]]. The rats were studied through adulthood and were found to be fatter than the offspring whose mothers ate healthier. This study showed that the diet of mothers not only affects the offspring's chemical physiology but also their likelihood of becoming even more unhealthy through their natural preference to bad habits.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/06/080630200951.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paternal obesity effects on the fetus===
Researchers from the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]]'s [[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]] (NIDDK) conducted a study and found that early-onset paternal obesity is connected with an increased risk of [[liver disease]] in their kin.  Researchers found that obese fathers had an elevated level of [[serum alanine aminotransferase]] (ALT), a liver enzyme, compared to fathers who were not obese.  They did a secondary analysis that excluded obese offspring.  Children who were a normal weight but had obese fathers still had elevated ALT levels, which indicated that a child's ALT levels are not dependent upon the child's own BMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/health/early-onset-paternal-obesity-linked-to-increased-risk-for-liver-disease-in-child_10033634.html|title=Early-onset paternal obesity linked to increased risk for liver disease in child|publisher=|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obesity effects on the mother==

===Disease===
Obese women have an increased risk of pregnancy-related complications, including [[hypertension]], [[gestational diabetes]], and [[blood clot]]s. Also, the mother is at risk of going into preterm labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Konkel|first1=Lindsey|title=7 Ways Pregnant Women affect babies|url=http://www.livescience.com/36908-ways-pregnant-women-affect-babies.html|website=Livescience|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=webmd/&gt;  Maternal obesity is also known to be associated with increased rates of complications in late pregnancy such as [[Cesarean section|cesarean delivery]], and [[shoulder dystocia]].&lt;ref name=medscape2&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/550451 Maternal Obesity in Early Pregnancy and Risk of Spontaneous and Elective Preterm Delivery: A Retrospective Cohort Study] Gordon C.S. Smith, MD, PhD; Imran Shah, MSc; Jill P. Pell, MD; Jennifer A. Crossley, PhD; Richard Dobbie, BSc. Posted: 01/19/2007; American Journal of Public Health. 2007;97(1):157–162.&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[meta-analysis]] estimated that [[Cesarean section|Cesarean delivery]] rates increased with [[odds ratio]]s of 1.5 among overweight, 2 among obese, and 3 among severely obese women, compared with normal weight pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Chu SY, Kim SY, Schmid CH, etal |title=Maternal obesity and risk of cesarean delivery: a meta-analysis |journal=Obes Rev |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=385–94 |date=September 2007  |pmid=17716296 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00397.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[morbidly obese]] women who have not had children before are at increased risk of [[all–cause preterm deliveries]].  It is well recognized that obese women are at increased risk of [[preeclampsia]] and that women who have never been pregnant are at higher risk of preeclampsia than women who have had children in the past.&lt;ref name=medscape2/&gt;

===Effects of negative diets===
Poor [[glycemic]] control can lead to [[neural tube defects]].  The usual increase in [[insulin resistance]] seen in late pregnancy is enhanced in obese mothers, causing an [[postprandial]] increase in glucose, [[lipid]]s, and amino acids, as well as excessive fetal exposure to fuel sources.{{clarify|date=October 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  This, in turn, increases fetal size, fat storage, and potential risk for disease. For mothers, impaired glucose tolerance and [[hyperlipidemia]] are more common among obese mothers.

==Modifying the risks==
There are many options available in treating obesity, such as: altering one's diet and exercising regularly.  Moderate forms of exercise, such as [[walking]], can lead to healthy [[weight loss]].  Some people who are obese turn to [[Gastric bypass|gastric bypass surgery]] in order to reduce their appetites.  It is always advised to consult a physician regarding any obesity treatment.

It is recommended that obese women should try to lose weight before becoming pregnant, yet women should not diet during pregnancy because [[Nutrition in pregnancy|sufficient nutrition]] is important for pregnant women and women planning pregnancy.  Women with gastric banding can have normal pregnancies and better outcomes than women who do not have the surgery, but in most cases, doctors have agreed that pregnancy should wait until surgery-related weight loss has stabilized. Clinicians have been encouraged to talk to women who are pregnant or may become pregnant about getting enough folic acid, quitting smoking, and avoiding alcohol.  Women are also recommended to have appropriate calorie intake and exercise adequately.

==Nutrition recommendations==
{{Main|Nutrition in pregnancy|Prenatal nutrition#Overweight and Obese Women}}

Pregnant women who ate more sweets, such as candy and processed juices, in early pregnancy were at higher risk of gaining excessive weight.  A healthy, well-balanced diet during pregnancy can also help to minimize some pregnancy symptoms such as nausea and constipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/patientcare/healthcare_services/pregnancy_childbirth/care/the_pregnant_mother/Pages/index.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404053449/http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/patientcare/healthcare_services/pregnancy_childbirth/care/the_pregnant_mother/Pages/index.aspx |archivedate=2009-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exercise recommendations==
{{Further|Pregnancy#Exercise}}
During pregnancy, doctors recommend light exercise.  Doctors state that exercise can help the comfort of the mother and the well-being of the unborn child.  Some benefits include, but are not limited to: reduced [[back pain]], decrease in [[constipation]], less likely to gain excess weight, decreased chance of gestational diabetes, easier [[Childbirth|labor]], quicker recovery, and better physical and emotional health of the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pregnancy.about.com/od/stayinghealthy/a/morepgexercise.htm|title=Pregnant Women Need More Exercise|publisher=|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If negative signs and symptoms occur after exercising, pregnant females should stop immediately. Some signs include: dizziness, faintness, headache, shortness of breath, uterine contractions, vaginal bleeding, fluid leaking, or heart palpitations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7849">[[File:Watermelon seedless.jpg|right|thumb|Seedless watermelon]]
In [[botany]] and [[horticulture]], '''parthenocarpy''' (literally meaning "virgin fruit") is the natural or artificially induced production of fruit without [[Fertilisation|fertilization]] of [[ovule]]s, which makes the fruit seedless. [[Stenospermocarpy]] may also produce apparently [[seedless fruit]], but the seeds are actually aborted while they are still small. Parthenocarpy (or stenospermocarpy) occasionally occurs as a mutation in nature; if it affects every flower the plant can no longer [[sexual reproduction of plants|sexually reproduce]] but might be able to propagate by [[apomixis]] or by [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative]] means.

However, parthenocarpy of some fruits on a plant may be of value. Up to 20% of the fruits of wild [[parsnip]] are parthenocarpic. The seedless wild parsnip fruit are preferred by certain herbivores and so serve as a "decoy defense" against [[seed predation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zangerl AR, Nitao JK, Berenbaum MR |title=Parthenocarpic fruits in wild parsnip: decoy defence against a specialist herbivore |journal=Evolutionary Ecology |volume=5 |pages=136–45 |year=1991 |doi=10.1007/BF02270830 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juniperus osteosperma|Utah juniper]] has a similar defense against bird feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fuentes M, Schupp EW |title=Empty seeds reduce seed predation by birds in ''Juniperus osteosperma'' |journal=Evolutionary Ecology |volume=12 |pages=823–7 |year=1998 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1006594532392#|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110115906/http://www.udc.es/dep/bave/marcelino/FuentesSchupp1998.pdf |archivedate=2006-11-10 |doi=10.1023/A:1006594532392 |format= |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to produce seedless fruit when [[pollination]] is unsuccessful may be an advantage to a plant because it provides food for the plant's seed dispersers. Without a fruit crop, the seed dispersing animals may starve or migrate.

In some plants, pollination or another stimulation is required for parthenocarpy, termed '''stimulative parthenocarpy'''. Plants that do not require pollination or other stimulation to produce parthenocarpic fruit have '''[[vegetative reproduction|vegetative]] parthenocarpy'''. Seedless [[cucumber]]s are an example of vegetative parthenocarpy, seedfull [[watermelon]] is an example of [[stenospermocarpy]].As they are immature seeds.(aborted ones)

Plants that moved from one area of the world to another may not always be accompanied by their pollinating partner, and the lack of [[pollinator]]s has spurred human cultivation of parthenocarpic varieties. Some parthenocarpic varieties have been developed as [[genetically modified organism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Acciarri | first1 = N. | last2 = Restaino | first2 = F. | last3 = Vitelli | first3 = G. | last4 = Perrone | first4 = D. | last5 = Zottini | first5 = M. | last6 = Pandolfini | first6 = T. | last7 = Spena | first7 = A. | last8 = Rotino | first8 = G. | title = Genetically modified parthenocarpic eggplants: Improved fruit productivity under both greenhouse and open field cultivation | journal = BMC Biotechnology | volume = 2 | pages = 4 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6750-2-4 | pmid =  11934354| pmc =101493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial importance ==
Seedlessness is seen as a desirable trait in edible fruit with hard seeds such as [[banana]], [[pineapple]],  [[orange (fruit)|orange]] and [[grapefruit]]. Parthenocarpy is also desirable in fruit crops that may be difficult to pollinate or fertilize, such as [[Ficus carica|fig]], [[tomato]] and summer [[Squash (fruit)|squash]]. In [[dioecious]] species, such as [[persimmon]], parthenocarpy increases fruit production because staminate trees do not need to be planted to provide pollen. Parthenocarpy is undesirable in nut crops, such as [[pistachio]], for which the seed is the edible part. Horticulturists have selected and propagated parthenocarpic [[cultivar]]s of many plants, including [[banana]], [[Common fig|fig]], cactus pear ([[Opuntia]]), [[breadfruit]] and [[eggplant]]. Some plants, such as pineapple, produce seedless fruits when a single cultivar is grown because they are self-infertile. Some [[cucumber]]s produce seedless fruit if [[pollinator]]s are excluded. Strange as it seems, seedless watermelon plants are grown from seeds. The seeds are produced by crossing a diploid parent with a tetraploid parent to produce [[triploid]] seeds.

When sprayed on flowers, any of the [[plant hormone]]s [[gibberellin]], [[auxin]] and [[cytokinin]] could stimulate the development of parthenocarpic fruit. That is termed '''artificial parthenocarpy'''. Plant hormones are seldom used commercially to produce parthenocarpic fruit. Home gardeners sometimes spray their tomatoes with an auxin to assure fruit production.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Some parthenocarpic cultivars have been developed as [[genetically modified organism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pandolfini T, Rotino GL, Camerini S, Defez R, Spena A |title=Optimisation of transgene action at the post-transcriptional level: high quality parthenocarpic fruits in industrial tomatoes |journal=BMC Biotechnol. |volume=2 |page=1 |year=2002 |pmid=11818033 |pmc=65046 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/2/1 |doi=10.1186/1472-6750-2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parthenocarpic cultivars are of ancient origin. The oldest known cultivated plant is a parthenocarpic fig first that was grown at least 11,200 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kislev ME, Hartmann A, Bar-Yosef O |title=Early domesticated fig in the Jordan Valley |journal=Science |volume=312 |issue=5778 |pages=1372–4 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16741119 |doi=10.1126/science.1125910 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;312/5778/1372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some climates, normally-seeded [[pear]] cultivars produce mainly seedless fruit for lack of pollination.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071121043502/http://extension.oregonstate.edu/catalog/html/ec/ec986/ R.L. Stebbins, W.M. Mellenthin, and P.B. Lombard (1981) ''Pollination &amp; Commercial Varieties of Pears in Oregon'' Oregon State University Extension Service.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misconceptions ==
* Most commercial seedless grape cultivars, such as 'Thompson Seedless', are seedless because of not parthenocarpy but [[stenospermocarpy]].&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, M., Bouquet, A., Edward, L. (1992). {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wnNvmRjfxgQC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=viticulture%20stenospermocarpy&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=viticulture%20stenospermocarpy&amp;f=false|title=''Biology of the grapevine''|isbn=9780521305075|last1=Mullins|first1=Michael G.|last2=Bouquet|first2=Alain|last3=Williams|first3=Larry E.|date=1992-07-16}}. Cambridge University Press, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parthenocarpy is sometimes claimed to be the equivalent of [[parthenogenesis]] in animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/pa/partheno.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628154204/http://www.bartleby.com/65/pa/partheno.html|title=parthenogenesis. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-07|archivedate=28 June 2008|work=bartleby.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is incorrect because parthenogenesis is a method of asexual reproduction, with embryo formation without fertilization, and parthenocarpy involves fruit formation, without seed formation. The plant equivalent of parthenogenesis is [[apomixis]].

'''Pelagia''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Πελαγία}}), distinguished as '''Pelagia of Antioch''', '''Pelagia the Penitent''', and '''Pelagia the Harlot''', was a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Christian saint|saint]] and [[hermetism|hermit]] in the 4th or 5th century. Her [[feast day]] was celebrated on 8 October, originally in common with Saints [[Pelagia the Virgin]] and [[Pelagia of Tarsus]].&lt;ref&gt;Greek [[Synaxarion]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Kirsch|1911}}{{refn|group=n|The [[Roman Martyrology]] eventually distinguished the dates of the other Pelagias, removing them to other months.{{sfnp|Kirsch|1911}}}}

Pelagia's [[hagiography]], attributed to James{{sfnp|Coon|1997|p=[https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=w_1-t_K2ZuMC&amp;pg=PA78 78]}}{{sfn|James the Deacon}} or Jacob{{sfnp|Cameron|2016|p=85}}{{sfn|James the Deacon}} ({{lang-la|Jacobus}}), [[deacon]] of the church of [[Heliopolis (Syria)|Heliopolis]] (modern [[Baalbek]]),{{sfnp|Bunson &amp; al.|2003}} states that '''Margarita''' was the "foremost actress" and a prominent [[prostitution in ancient Rome|harlot]] in [[Antioch]].{{sfn|James the Deacon}} During one of the [[Synods of Antioch|city's church councils]], she passed by on a donkey surrounded by her entourage and a "worldly crowd".{{sfn|James the Deacon}} Perfumed and "immodestly" bareheaded, the outlines of her body were "clearly visible" beneath her [[gold cloth]], [[pearl]]s, and precious stones, which ran from her bare shoulders to her feet.{{sfn|James the Deacon}} Most of the fathers were shamed into looking away, but the bishop [[Saint Nonnus|Nonnus]] stared openly and confessed himself "delighted".{{sfn|James the Deacon}} Mocking his fellows, he condemned both them and himself for taking less care of their [[soul]]s than she had of her body.{{sfn|James the Deacon}} 

She appeared at his next [[Sunday service|Sunday]] [[sermon]] and Nonnus's sermon on [[hell]]{{sfn|James the Deacon}} and the goodness of [[Christian Heaven|paradise]]{{sfn|James the Deacon}} prompted her to [[repentance|repent]]. She had two of her [[Roman slavery|slaves]] trail Nonnus to his residence and then wrote him on [[wax tablet]]s, calling herself "sinful" and a "servant of the [[devil]]" but seeking mercy from God, who "came down to earth not for the sake of the righteous but to save sinners".{{sfn|James the Deacon}} Nonnus replied to the anonymous request that God knew her and her past and that he would receive her, but only in the presence of the other bishops.{{sfn|James the Deacon}}

She went to the [[basilica]] of [[Julian of Antioch|Saint Julian]] to see them; when Nonnus demanded surety that she would not return to her former life, she fell to the ground and threatened that if she were refused admission to the Church, all her future sins would be held against him at his judgment.{{sfn|James the Deacon}} The archbishop was informed and sent the [[deaconess]] Romana to clothe her in the [[baptismal gown]].{{sfn|James the Deacon}} Nonnus took her confession and baptized "Margarita" under her birth name Pelagia, with Romana serving as her [[godparent|godmother]].{{sfn|James the Deacon}} The [[devil]] shortly afterward arrived to complain, but was driven off when Pelagia made the [[Sign of the Cross]] and breathed upon him.{{sfn|James the Deacon}} He returned the next night to renew his complaints and was driven off the same way.{{sfn|James the Deacon}} On the third day, Pelagia directed her slave [[steward (office)|steward]] to inventory her possessions. She then turned them over to Nonnus, who disbursed them to the widows, orphans, and poor of the city.{{sfn|James the Deacon}} She further [[manumission|freed her slaves]], male and female, "taking their golden [[torc]]s off with her own hands".{{sfn|James the Deacon}} She then began living with Romana.{{sfn|James the Deacon}} 

The night before it came time to remove her baptismal gown, she stole out in the dark wearing one of Nonnus's [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]]s. She headed for [[Jerusalem]], where she built a [[cell (monk)|cell]] on the [[Mount of Olives]].{{sfn|James the Deacon}} She lived there for three or four years, disguising herself as a male [[hermit|recluse]] and [[eunuch]] under the name '''Pelagi&lt;u&gt;us&lt;/u&gt;'''.{{sfn|James the Deacon}} She then died, apparently as a result of extreme [[asceticism]], which had emaciated her to the point she could no longer be recognized.{{sfn|James the Deacon}} Upon the discovery that the renowned monk had been a woman, the "holy fathers" tried to keep it a secret, but the gossip spread and her relics drew pilgrims from as far off as [[Jericho]] and the [[Jordan River|Jordan valley]].{{sfn|James the Deacon}}

The [[Pelagia the Virgin|historical St&amp;nbsp;Pelagia]], mentioned by [[St&amp;nbsp;Ambrose]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ambrose]], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf210.iv.vii.iv.vii.html ''De Virg.'', III, 7, 33].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ambrose]], ''Ep.'' xxxvii. ''ad Simplic.''&lt;/ref&gt; and in two sermons by [[John Chrysostom]],&lt;ref name=chrys&gt;[[Chrysostom]], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf110.iii.LXIV.html ''Hom. in Matth.'' lxvii.] {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Antioch]]ene [[holy virgin|virgin]] who [[Christian martyrdom|committed suicide]] to avoid being forced to offer [[ancient Roman religion|pagan]] [[sacrifice]] during the [[Diocletianic Persecution]]. [[Marina the Monk|Saint Marina]], the Latin equivalent of "Pelagia", was another bride who became a transvestite monk, in her case to escape an unwanted marriage.{{sfnp|Cameron|2016|p=87}}{{refn|group=n|A third St&amp;nbsp;Pelagia of Antioch was [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret]], whose name derives from its earlier form "Margarita".}} Aspects of their stories were apparently combined with [[New Testament apocrypha|apocrypha]]l accounts of [[Mary Magdalene]],{{sfnp|Coon|1997|p=[https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=w_1-t_K2ZuMC&amp;pg=PA77 77–78]}} [[Bible|Biblical]] accounts of [[Solomon]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]] and of [[Jesus]] and various women in the [[New Testament]],{{sfnp|Coon|1997|pp=[https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=w_1-t_K2ZuMC&amp;pg=PA80 80–82]}} and even with [[Greek myth]]s regarding [[Aphrodite]]{{sfnp|Usener|1879}}{{refn|group=n|[[Johann Peter Kirsch|Kirsch]],{{sfnp|Kirsch|1911}} however, considers [[Hermann Usener|Usener]]'s arguments associating the saints Pelagia with the pagan Aphrodite{{sfnp|Usener|1879}} to have been "completely disproved" by Delehaye.{{who|date=September 2015}}{{where?|date=September 2015}}{{why?|date=September 2015}}}} to create the story of the harlot Pelagia. [[John Chrysostom|Chrysostom]]'s {{circa|lk=no|390}} sermon also mentions an anonymous (but apparently famous) actress and prostitute "from a wicked city in [[Phoenice]]" (possibly [[Baalbek#History|Heliopolis]]) who seduced "the empress's brother" but converted "in our own day".{{sfnp|Cameron|2016|p=86–87}} [[Constantius II]]'s wife [[Eusebia (empress)|Eusebia]] had two brothers, [[Eusebius]] and [[Hypatius (consul 359)|Hypatius]], joint [[Roman consul|consuls]] in 359, who both lived for many years in Antioch.{{sfnp|Cameron|2016|p=87–88}} In his account, attempts were made to lure her back to her former life by the Roman prefect and some of his soldiers,&lt;ref name=chrys/&gt; a role played by Satan in the hagiography.{{sfnp|Cameron|2016|p=86}} The mention of a meeting of the Syrian bishops is unhelpful for dating, as more than thirty [[Synods of Antioch]] were conducted in late antiquity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4073">[[File:XPeterArtediMaryPinzon.jpg|thumb|right|Peter Artedi, a painting by the artist Mary Pinzón, how he might have looked like.]]

'''Peter Artedi''' or '''Petrus Arctaedius''' (27 February 1705{{snd}}28 September 1735) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[natural history|naturalist]] and is known as the [[List of people known as the father or mother of something|"father of]] [[Ichthyology]]."

Artedi was born in [[Anundsjö]] in the province of [[Ångermanland]]. Intending to become a [[clergyman]], he went, in 1724, to study [[theology]] at [[Uppsala University]], but he turned his attention to [[medicine]] and [[natural history]], especially [[ichthyology]], a science that he influenced greatly. In 1728 his countryman [[Carl Linnaeus]] arrived in Uppsala, and a lasting friendship was formed between the two. In 1732 both left Uppsala, Artedi for [[England]], and Linnaeus for [[Lapland, Sweden|Lappland]]; before parting they reciprocally bequeathed to each other their manuscripts and books in the event of death.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Artedi, Peter|volume=2|page=663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artedi accidentally drowned at [[Amsterdam]], where he was engaged in cataloguing the collections of [[Albertus Seba]], a wealthy [[Netherlands|Dutchman]], who had formed what was perhaps the richest museum of his time. According to agreement, his manuscripts came into the hands of Linnaeus, and his ''Bibliotheca Ichthyologica'' and ''Philosophia Ichthyologica'', together with a life of the author, were published at [[Leiden]] in 1738&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; under the title "Ichthyologia sive opera omnia de piscibus ..." .

Artedi was buried in a pauper's grave in St Anthony's churchyard in Amsterdam on 2 October 1735. His grave was never marked and the churchyard site has since been appropriated for other purposes.
An [[epitaph]], written in Latin by [[Anders Celsius]], and translated into English by [[George Shaw]], is known because it was inscribed on the back flyleaf of Linnaeus's own copy of "Ichthyologia":

:Here lies poor Artedi, in foreign land pyx'd
:Not a man nor a fish, but something betwixt,
:Not a man, for his life among fishes he past,
:Not a fish, for he perished by water at last.

A memorial stone to Peter Artedi was erected in Amsterdam Zoological Gardens and unveiled on 28 June 1905; it is inscribed in Latin. Other stone memorials are in [[Anundsjö]] and Nordmaling in Sweden.

Linnaeus named ''[[Artedia]]''&lt;ref&gt;Hortus cliffortianus (1738): p. 89; Species plantarum (1753): 242&lt;/ref&gt; (Apiaceae), a monotypic genus from the eastern Mediterranean, after his friend.

A '''promise''' is a commitment by someone to do or not do something. As a [[noun]] ''promise'' means a declaration assuring that one will or will not do something. As a [[verb]] it means to commit oneself by a promise to do or give.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/promise|title=promise|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also mean a capacity for good, similar to a value that is to be realized in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, DorisJOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL SCIENCE, V. 19 (4), 09/2012, p. 298-311&lt;/ref&gt;

In the law of [[contract]], an exchange of promises is usually held to be legally enforceable, according to the Latin maxim ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]''.

== Types ==
There are lots of types of promises. There are solemn promises, such as marriage vows or military oaths. There are legal contracts, enforceable by law. Or, there are fairy tale promises, regrettable and problematic at the time they must be honored. And lastly, there are election promises, commitments that most people realize will later be shaped by politics and compromise.

Both an [[oath]] and an [[affirmation in law|affirmation]] can be a promise.  One special kind of promise is the [[vow]].

A notable type of promise is an [[election promise]]. Election promises are pledges that will be later shaped by politics and the cooperation of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce D.Promise.Journal of Occupational Science(2012), 19 (4):298-311&lt;/ref&gt;

A promise is a manifestation of intent to act or refrain from acting in a specified way at some point in the future.&lt;ref name="Hogg 2011"&gt;{{cite book | title=Promises and Contract Law | last=Hogg | first=Martin | year=2011 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0-521-19338-2 | pages=1–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's communicated by one party, to at least one additional party, to signify a commitment has been made. The person manifesting intent is the Promisor. The person to whom the manifestation is addressed is the Promisee.

In law, contracts are created by a process of offer and acceptance. An offer to enter into a binding contract consists of an indication by the Oferror to be legally bound by the terms indicated in the offer once the person to whom the offer is addressed, the Offeree, has accepted the offer in the manner indicated in the offer (if any). Once acceptance has taken place, a binding contract has come into existence and both parties are legally bound by its terms. A contract is therefore a voluntarily assumed legal obligation. A party who fails to perform his obligations under the contract is said to be in breach of contract and is liable to compensate the other party. Compensation normally takes the form of payment of a sum of money sufficient to place the party entitled to damages in the same position as in which that party would have been if the contract had been performed. For instance, if A agrees to sell a car to B for $10,000 and B agrees to pay, then if A fails to deliver the car, B would be entitled to compensation sufficient to enable B to purchase a similar car without having to spend more than the agreed price. Therefore, if by the time of the breach the price of the car has increased by 10%, A would be liable to pay B $1,000, assuming that B has not paid anything yet. If B has paid a deposit of $5,000, then B would be entitled to restitution of his deposit plus the $1,000. A contract may consist of mutual undertakings, as in the example just given, where A agreed to deliver a car and B agrees to pay for it. Such contracts are known as bilateral contracts. But a contract may only give rise to an undertaking  by one party, as where A agrees to pay B if B finds a particular car which A has been trying to acquire. B is under no duty to search but would be entitled to payment if she finds the car.

Oath:
Individuals that take oaths should be honest and sincere about their statement or goal and be committed to fulfil a specified oath.&lt;ref name="pmid20056339"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buetow SA, Adams P |title=Oath-taking: a divine prescription for health-related behaviour change? |journal=[[Medical Hypotheses]] |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=422–7 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20056339 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2009.06.035 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306-9877(09)00466-6 |accessdate=2011-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426140454/https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306-9877(09)00466-6 |archivedate=2018-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of promises would include solemn promises which includes marriage vows and military oaths. People also make fairy tale promises which are regrettable and difficult at the time the promise is made.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, Doris, Promise - Journal of Occupational Science,  http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/14427591/v19i0004/298_p&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditional commitment==
In [[loan guarantee]]s, a commitment requires to meet an [[equity commitment]], as well as other conditions, before the loan guarantee is closed.

==Religion==
Religions have similar attitudes towards promises.

===Christianity===
{{Main article|Oath}}
In [[Christianity]], a distinction is made between simple promises and oaths or vows.  An oath is a promise invoking [[God]] as a witness.&lt;ref name="bunson2010"&gt;{{cite book | title=Catholic Almanac 2010 | last=Bunson | first=Matthew | year=2010 | publisher=[[Our Sunday Visitor]] | isbn=978-1-59276-614-7 | page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vow is a solemn form of a promise typically made to commit oneself to a moral good with God as witness, and binds oneself to its fulfillment over time.&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, op. cit. p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups of Christians, such as the [[Religious Society of Friends]] and the [[Mennonite]]s, object to the taking of both oaths and affirmations, basing their objections upon a commandment given in the [[Sermon on the Mount]], and regard all promises to be witnessed by God.

See also [[Covenant (biblical)|biblical covenants]].

===Islam===
In [[An-Nahl]], God forbids [[Muslim]]s to break their promises after they have confirmed them.  All promises are regarded as having Allah as their witness and guarantor. In the [[hadith]], Muhammad states that a Muslim who made a promise and then saw a better thing to do, should do the better thing and then make an act of [[atonement]] for breaking the promise.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It is forbidden to break an oath in Islam. However, when someone does break an oath, they are required to beg for forgiveness and make up for the sin by feeding/clothing 10 poor people or freeing a slave(which is nearly impossible today), or, if unable to do these, to fast for three days. One of the four types of promises that are punished quickly is when you want to harm a relationship when the other person wants to keep it.&lt;ref&gt;"Greater Sins." Al-Islam.org by the Ahlul Bayt DILP - Home. N.p., n.d. Web. 5 Dec. 2011. &lt;http://www.al-islam.org/greater_sins_complete/26.ht{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Philosophers have tried to establish rules for promises.  [[Immanuel Kant]] suggested promises should always be kept, while some [[Consequentialism|consequentialists]] argue that promises should be broken whenever doing so would yield benefits.  In ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', [[Iain King]] tried to reconcile these positions, suggesting that promises should be kept 'unless they are worth less to others than a new option is to you,'&lt;ref&gt;''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong'' (2008), p.142&lt;/ref&gt; and that this requires a relevant, unforeseen and reasonably unforeseeable change in the situation more important than the promise itself arising after the promise is made.&lt;ref&gt;''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong]]'' (2008), p.143&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to Kant, some Rossian pluralists believe that morality with regards to right and wrong cannot be formalized in writing.&lt;ref&gt;''Moral Rules and Principles.'' (2006), p.384&lt;/ref&gt; In certain circumstances, breaking one’s promise may be more beneficial than the cost of keeping it.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} These moral principles need guidance and good judgments to maximize the benefits of people involved.

==Politics==
{{main|Election promise}}
In [[democracy]] promises are made to offer assurance, especially during election. Political tactic to offer promise that would guarantee a better future to lure voters. In Western democracies, election promises are more often fulfilled than not{{fact|date=March 2018}}. However, certain promises are famously [[Election_promise#Examples_of_broken_promises|broken]]

==Society==

The "promise", in [[sociology]] and society, as discussed by [[C. Wright Mills]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialsciences.nsula.edu/assets/Site-Files/The-Promise.pdf|title=Home|author=|date=|website=nsula.edu|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913204310/http://socialsciences.nsula.edu/assets/Site-Files/The-Promise.pdf|archivedate=13 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others is the ideological impression or commitment our society makes to us, and the commitment we make to our society in return for [[prosperity]]. The best or most popular example of this is [[The American Dream]].

==Psychology==

Promises are compared with threats by [[Verbrugge]], [[Dieussaert]], [[Schaeken]] and William.&lt;ref&gt;Promise is debt, threat another matter: the effect of credibility on the interpretation of conditional promises and threats. Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology, 58(2), 106-12. http://search.proquest.com/docview/200348761&lt;/ref&gt; When a threat or promise is conditional, it tends to receive biconditional interpretation. Also, both threats and promises are highly controlled by the speaker. The fundamental difference is the valence of the prospective action on the speaker's part. In the case of a promise it is generally positive while in the case of a threat it is negative. There is some evidence to suggest that threats are perceived simply as negative promises&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wray|first=Helen|last2=Wood|first2=Jeffrey S.|last3=Haigh|first3=Matthew|last4=Stewart|first4=Andrew J.|date=2016-07-03|title=Threats may be negative promises (but warnings are more than negative tips)|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20445911.2016.1152972|journal=Journal of Cognitive Psychology|volume=28|issue=5|pages=593–600|doi=10.1080/20445911.2016.1152972|issn=2044-5911}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, promises are often made with an intent on the speaker's part to convince a hearer to do something by holding out the prospect of a reward; threats by contrasts are often made with an intent to influence a hearer's behavior by holding out the prospect of a punishment.   In addition, certain characteristics of promises and threats, such as "magnitude" and "credibility", affect the probability that the target will gain compliance or failure.&lt;ref&gt;[[DeLamater John D.]] &amp; Meyers J. Daniels. Social Psychology. Wadsworth Publishing; 7 edition, 2010, p.212&lt;/ref&gt;
Promises can fall under many different categories, however they will have two key components. The type of activity that the promises undertakes to do, and the content of the promise. Promises can give us both the security that something is being fully guaranteed and the stress that you are guaranteeing something that cannot be verified at that given moment. This can create both a positive and a negative effect on our minds.&lt;ref name = PsychologyToday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-the-name-love/201102/promise-me-youll-try|title=Promise me you'll try|author=|date=|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RINA''' was founded in [[Genoa]] in 1861 under the name '''REGISTRO ITALIANO NAVALE''', by the "Associazione della Mutua Assicurazione Marittima" (Mutual Marine Insurance Association) [established in Genoa in 1857 by ship managers and shipowners (or "ship shareholders"), to cover risks related to loss and/or damage of the hull and rigging of sailing ships], to meet the needs of Italian maritime operators, as had already occurred in Great Britain and France.
Since its foundation, Registro Italiano Navale has been an instrument of support for economic development in the areas where it operates.
Over 150 years later, the role of RINA has not changed but it has expanded to meet the needs of a constantly evolving international economy.

== The RINA Group ==
RINA S.p.A. is an operational company created by Registro Italiano Navale, a private body founded in [[Genoa]] in 1861 by a number of economic concerns involved in the maritime transport sector.
RINA is one of the founding members of [[International Association of Classification Societies|IACS]] and actively participates in technical, research and rule-making groups in different institutional contexts at national and international level.
RINA S.p.A. operates competitively in the market and offers assessment, control, certification and research services, in compliance with national and international rules, related to materials, design, technology, products and plants, as well as undertaking tasks entrusted by governmental bodies and other authorities.

== Organisation and structure ==
The organisational structure of the RINA Group consists of the parent company RINA S.p.A. and other associated or subsidiary companies.
The RINA Group has offices in 42 countries worldwide; the Head Office is in [[Genoa]] and it has about 120 branch offices, 40 of which in Italy, and a workforce of over 1600 people.
Particular attention is given to the development of human resources and to investment in Information Technology.

===Classification rules===
{{Expand section|additional information on RINA's actual marine classification rules and standards|date=September 2008}}

RINA provides quality assurance and certification for important [[ship]]'s components and accessories, including life-saving appliances, marine pollution prevention, fire protection, navigation, [[radio]] communication equipment, deck gear, cables, rodes, and [[anchor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petersmith.net.nz/boat-anchors/classification.php Anchor Certification, HHP &amp; SHHP Classification, and Type Approval]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In December 1999 the tanker [[MV Erika]] sank off the coast of Brittany, causing a major oil spill. RINA was the certification society responsible for issuing all the safety certificates for Erika. Because of this the French oil company Total, who was eventually told to pay damages for the incident, claimed that RINA should be held responsible.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.english.rfi.fr/environment/20100330-total-loses-erika-oil-spill-appeal&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Space medicine''' is the practice of [[medicine]] on [[astronauts]] in [[outer space]] whereas [[astronautical hygiene]] is the application of science and technology to the prevention or control of exposure to the hazards that may cause astronaut ill health.  Both these sciences work together to ensure that astronauts work in a safe environment. The main objective is to discover how well and for how long people can survive the extreme conditions in space, and how fast they can adapt to the Earth's environment after returning from their voyage.  Medical consequences such as possible [[blindness]] and [[Osteoporosis|bone loss]] have been associated with [[human spaceflight]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20140127"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Beings Not Made for Space |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/science/bodies-not-made-for-space.html |date=January 27, 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=January 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired-20120723"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mann |first=Adam |title=Blindness, Bone Loss, and Space Farts: Astronaut Medical Oddities |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/07/medicine-psychology-space/ |date=July 23, 2012 |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=July 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Hubertus Strughold]] (1898–1987), a former [[Nazi]] physician and physiologist, was brought to the [[United States]] after [[World War II]] as part of [[Operation Paperclip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4443934.stm |title=Project Paperclip: Dark side of the Moon |date=21 November 2005 |author=Andrew Walker |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He first coined the term "space medicine" in 1948 and was the first and only Professor of Space Medicine at the [[School of Aviation Medicine]] (SAM) at [[Randolph Air Force Base]], [[Texas]]. In 1949 Strughold was made director of the [[Department of Space Medicine]] at the SAM (which is now the [[United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine|US Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine]] (USAFSAM) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. He played an important role in developing the [[pressure suit]] worn by early American astronauts. He was a co-founder of the Space Medicine Branch of the [[Aerospace Medical Association]] in 1950. The aeromedical library at Brooks AFB was named after him in 1977, but later renamed because documents from the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal]] linked Strughold to medical experiments in which inmates of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] were tortured and killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency=Associated Press | authorlink=Associated Press | date=2006-05-19 | url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12869190/ | title=Former Nazi removed from Space Hall of Fame | publisher=MSNBC | accessdate=2006-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical investigations in space ==
Astronauts are not the only ones who benefit from space medicine research. Several medical products have been developed that are [[space spinoffs]], that is practical applications for the field of medicine arising out of the space program. Because of joint research efforts between NASA, the National Institutes on Aging (a part of the National Institutes of Health), and other aging-related organizations, space exploration has benefited a particular segment of society, seniors. Evidence of aging related medical research conducted in space was most publicly noticeable during STS-95 (See below).

=== Pre-Mercury through Apollo ===
* [[Radiation therapy]] for the treatment of cancer: In conjunction with the [[Cleveland Clinic]], the cyclotron at [[Glenn Research Center]] in Cleveland, Ohio was used in the first clinical trials for the treatment and evaluation of [[neutron therapy]] for cancer patients.&lt;ref&gt;Gahbauer, R., Koh, K. Y., Rodriguez-Antunez, A., Jelden, G. L., Turco, R. F., Horton, J., ... &amp; Roberts, W. (1980). Preliminary results of fast neutron treatments in carcinoma of the pancreas.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Foldable [[Walker (mobility)|walkers]]: Made from a lightweight metal material developed by NASA for aircraft and spacecraft, foldable walkers are portable and easy to manage.
* Personal alert systems: These are emergency alert devices that can be worn by individuals who may require emergency medical or safety assistance. When a button is pushed, the device sends a signal to a remote location for help. To send the signal, the device relies on telemetry technology developed at NASA.
* [[Computed axial tomography|CAT]] and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scans: These devices are used by hospitals to see inside the [[human body]]. Their development would not have been possible without the technology provided by NASA after it found a way to take better pictures of the Earth’s moon.&lt;ref&gt;Goldin, D. S. (1995). Keynote address: Second NASA/Uniformed Services University of Health Science International Conference on Telemedicine, Bethesda, Maryland. Journal of medical systems, 19(1), 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Muscle stimulator device: This device is used for ½ hour per day to prevent muscle atrophy in paralyzed individuals. It provides electrical stimulation to muscles which is equal to jogging three miles per week. Christopher Reeve used these in his therapy.
* Orthopedic evaluation tools: Equipment to evaluate posture, gait and balance disturbances was developed at NASA, along with a radiation-free way to measure bone flexibility using vibration.
* [[Diabetes|Diabetic]] foot mapping: This technique was developed at NASA’s center in Cleveland, Ohio to help monitor the effects of diabetes in feet.
* Foam cushioning: Special foam used for cushioning astronauts during liftoff is used in pillows and mattresses at many nursing homes and hospitals to help prevent ulcers, relieve pressure, and provide a better night’s sleep.
* Kidney dialysis machines: These machines rely on technology developed by NASA in order to process and remove toxic waste from used dialysis fluid.
* Talking [[wheelchair]]s: Paralyzed individuals who have difficulty speaking may use a talking feature on their wheelchairs which was developed by NASA to create synthesized speech for aircraft.
* Collapsible, lightweight wheelchairs: These wheelchairs are designed for portability and can be folded and put into trunks of cars. They rely on synthetic materials that NASA developed for its air and space craft
* Surgically implantable heart [[pacemaker]]: These devices depend on technologies developed by NASA for use with satellites. They communicate information about the activity of the pacemaker, such as how much time remains before the batteries need to be replaced.
* Implantable heart [[defibrillator]]: This tool continuously monitors heart activity and can deliver an electric shock to restore heartbeat regularity.
* EMS communications: Technology used to communicate telemetry between Earth and space was developed by NASA to monitor the health of astronauts in space from the ground. Ambulances use this same technology to send information—like [[EKG]] readings—from patients in transport to hospitals. This allows faster and better treatment.
* [[Weightlessness]] therapy: The weightlessness of space can allow some individuals with limited mobility on Earth—even those normally confined to wheelchairs—the freedom to move about with ease. Physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] took advantage of weightlessness in NASA's [[Vomit Comet]] aircraft in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6594821.stm |title=Hawking takes zero-gravity flight |date=2007-04-27 |work=BBC |access-date=2018-02-03 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea also led to the development of the [[Anti-Gravity Treadmill]] from NASA technology.
'''Feasibility of Long Duration Space Flights''' In the interest of creating the possibility of longer duration space flight, NASA has invested in the research and application of preventative space medicine, not only for medically preventable pathologies, but trauma as well. Although trauma constitutes more of a life-threatening situation, medically preventable pathologies pose more of a threat to astronauts. "The involved crewmember is endangered because of mission stress and the lack of complete treatment capabilities on board the spacecraft, which could result in the manifestation of more severe symptoms than those usually associated with the same disease in the terrestrial environment. Also, the situation is potentially hazardous for the other crewmembers because the small, closed, ecological system of the spacecraft is conducive to disease transmission. Even if the disease is not transmitted, the safety of the other crewmembers may be jeopardized by the loss of the capabilities of the crewmember who is ill. Such an occurrence will be more serious and potentially hazardous as the durations of manned missions increase and as operational procedures become more complex. Not only do the health and safety of the crewmembers become critical, but the probability of mission success is lessened if the illness occurs during flight. Aborting a mission to return an ill crewmember before mission goals are completed is costly and potentially dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wooley|first1=Bennie|title=Apollo Experience Report- Protection of Life and Health|journal=NASA Technical note|date=1972|page=20|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19720017450.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Space Shuttle era ===
With the additional lifting capability presented by the Space Shuttle program, NASA designers were able to create a more comprehensive medical readiness kit.  The SOMS consists of two separate packages: the Medications and Bandage Kit (MBK) and the Emergency Medical Kit (EMK). While the MBK contained capsulate medications (tablets, capsules, and suppositories), bandage materials, and topical medication, the EMK had medications to be administered by injection, items for performing minor surgeries, diagnostic/therapeutic items, and a microbiological test kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Emanuelli|first1=Matteo|title=Evolution of NASA Medical Kits: From Mercury to ISS|url=http://www.spacesafetymagazine.com/spaceflight/space-medicine/evolution-medical-kits-mercury-iss/|publisher=Space Safety Magazine|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Glenn]], the first American astronaut to orbit the Earth, returned with much fanfare to space once again on [[STS-95]] at 77 years of age to confront the physiological challenges preventing long-term space travel for astronauts—loss of bone density, loss of muscle mass, balance disorders, sleep disturbances, cardiovascular changes, and immune system depression—all of which are problems confronting aging people as well as astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/40thmerc7/glenn.htm|title=John H.

== Effects of space-travel ==
[[File:Space body fluid.svg|thumb|400px|The effects of microgravity on fluid distribution around the body (greatly exaggerated) ''(NASA)'']]
{{Main|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}
In October 2018, [[NASA]]-funded researchers found that lengthy journeys into [[outer space]], including travel to the [[Mars|planet Mars]], may substantially damage the  [[Gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tissues]] of astronauts. The studies support earlier work that found such journeys could significantly damage the [[brain]]s of [[astronaut]]s, and age them prematurely.&lt;ref name="TI-20181002"&gt;{{cite news |last=Griffin |first=Andrew |title=Travelling to Mars and deep into space could kill astronauts by destroying their guts, finds Nasa-funded study - Previous work has shown that astronauts could age prematurely and have damaged brain tissue after long journeys |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/nasa-mars-deep-space-journey-guts-gi-digestive-animal-study-gastrointestinal-health-a8563926.html |date=2 October 2018 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cardiac rhythms ===
{{Main|Cardiac rhythm problems during space flight}}
[[Cardiac dysrhythmia|Heart rhythm disturbances]] have been seen among astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;Platts, S. H., Stenger, M. B., Phillips, T. R., Brown, A. K., Arzeno, N. M., Levine, B., &amp; Summers, R. (2009). Evidence Based Review: Risk of Cardiac Rhythm Problems During Spaceflight.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these have been related to [[cardiovascular disease]], but it is not clear whether this was due to [[pre-existing condition]]s or [[Effect of spaceflight on the human body|effects of space flight]]. It is hoped that advanced screening for [[coronary disease]] has greatly mitigated this risk. Other heart rhythm problems, such as [[atrial fibrillation]], can develop over time, necessitating periodic screening of crewmembers’ heart rhythms. Beyond these terrestrial heart risks, some concern exists that prolonged exposure to [[microgravity]] may lead to heart rhythm disturbances. Although this has not been observed to date, further surveillance is warranted.

=== Decompression illness in spaceflight ===
In space, astronauts use a [[space suit]], essentially a self-contained individual spacecraft, to do spacewalks, or [[extra-vehicular activity|extra-vehicular activities]] (EVAs). Spacesuits are generally inflated with 100% [[oxygen]] at a total pressure that is less than a third of normal [[atmospheric pressure]].  Eliminating inert atmospheric components such as [[nitrogen]] allows the astronaut to breathe comfortably, but also have the mobility to use their hands, arms, and legs to complete required work, which would be more difficult in a higher pressure suit.

After the astronaut dons the spacesuit, air is replaced by 100% oxygen in a process called a "nitrogen purge". In order to reduce the risk of [[decompression sickness]], the astronaut must spend several hours "pre-breathing" at an intermediate nitrogen [[partial pressure]], in order to let their body tissues [[outgassing|outgas]] nitrogen slowly enough that bubbles are not formed. When the astronaut returns to the "shirt sleeve" environment of the spacecraft after an EVA, pressure is restored to whatever the operating pressure of that spacecraft may be, generally normal atmospheric pressure. [[Decompression illness]] in spaceflight consists of decompression sickness (DCS) and other injuries due to uncompensated changes in pressure, or [[barotrauma]].

==== Decompression sickness ====
[[Decompression sickness]] is the injury to the tissues of the body resulting from the presence of nitrogen bubbles in the tissues and blood. This occurs due to a rapid reduction in ambient pressure causing the dissolved nitrogen to come out of solution as gas bubbles within the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ackles | first = KN | title = Blood-Bubble Interaction in Decompression Sickness | journal = Defence R&amp;D Canada (DRDC) Technical Report | volume = DCIEM-73-CP-960 | year = 1973 | url = http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3867 | accessdate =23 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In space the risk of DCS is significantly reduced by using a technique to wash out the nitrogen in the body’s tissues. This is achieved by breathing 100% oxygen for a specified period of time before donning the spacesuit, and is continued after a nitrogen purge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts115/interview_tanner.html | title = Preflight Interview: Joe Tanner | first = Amiko | last = Nevills | publisher = NASA | year = 2006 | accessdate =26 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Webb | first1 = James T | last2 = Olson | first2 = RM | last3 = Krutz | first3 = RW | last4 = Dixon | first4 = G | last5 = Barnicott | first5 = PT | title = Human tolerance to 100% oxygen at 9.5 psia during five daily simulated 8-hour EVA exposures | journal = Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 415–21 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2730484 | doi=10.4271/881071}}&lt;/ref&gt; DCS may result from inadequate or interrupted pre-oxygenation time, or other factors including the astronaut’s level of hydration, physical conditioning, prior injuries and age. Other risks of DCS include inadequate nitrogen purge in the EMU, a strenuous or excessively prolonged EVA, or a loss of suit pressure. Non-EVA crewmembers may also be at risk for DCS if there is a loss of spacecraft cabin pressure.

Symptoms of DCS in space may include chest pain, shortness of breath, cough or pain with a deep breath, unusual fatigue, lightheadedness, dizziness, headache, unexplained musculoskeletal pain, tingling or numbness, extremities weakness, or visual abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Francis  | first1 = T James R  | last2 = Mitchell  | first2 = Simon J  | author2-link = Simon Mitchell  | year = 2003  | chapter = 10.6: Manifestations of Decompression Disorders  | pages = 578–584  | editor1-last = Brubakk  | editor1-first = Alf O  | editor2-last = Neuman  | editor2-first = Tom S  | title = Bennett and Elliott's physiology and medicine of diving  | edition = 5th Revised  | publisher = Saunders  | location = United States  | oclc = 51607923  | isbn = 978-0-7020-2571-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Barotrauma ====
[[Barotrauma]] is the injury to the tissues of air filled spaces in the body as a result of differences in pressure between the body spaces and the ambient atmospheric pressure. Air filled spaces include the middle ears, paranasal sinuses, lungs and gastrointestinal tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=US Navy Diving Manual, 6th revision |year=2006 |publisher=US Naval Sea Systems Command |location=United States |url=http://www.supsalv.org/00c3_publications.asp?destPage=00c3&amp;pageID=3.9 |accessdate=2008-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usn"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bennett and Elliott's physiology and medicine of diving, 5th Rev ed. |last=Brubakk |first=A.

=== Ultrasound and space ===
[[Ultrasound]] is the main diagnostic imaging tool on ISS and for the foreseeable future missions.  X-rays and [[CT scan]]s involve radiation which is unacceptable in the space environment.  Though [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] uses magnetics to create images, it is too large at present to consider as a viable option.  Ultrasound, which uses sound waves to create images and comes in laptop size packages, provides imaging of a wide variety of tissues and organs.  It is currently being used to look at the eyeball and the optic nerve to help determine the cause(s) of changes that NASA has noted mostly in long duration astronauts.  NASA is also pushing the limits of ultrasound use regarding musculoskeletal problems as these are some of the most common and most likely problems to occur.  Significant challenges to using ultrasounds on space missions is training the astronaut to use the equipment (ultrasound technicians spend years in training and developing the skills necessary to be "good" at their job) as well as interpreting the images that are captured.  Much of ultrasound interpretation is done real-time but it is impractical to train astronauts to actually read/interpret ultrasounds.  Thus, the data is currently being sent back to [[mission control]] and forwarded to medical personnel to read and interpret.  Future exploration class missions will need to be autonomous due to transmission times taking too long for urgent/emergent medical conditions.  The ability to be autonomous, or to use other equipment such as MRIs, is currently being researched.

=== Medicine in space ===
{{further|Medical treatment during spaceflight}}
The  [[Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity]] Study is funded by the [[National Space Biomedical Research Institute]] and involves the use of ultrasound among Astronauts including former ISS Commanders [[Leroy Chiao]] and [[Gennady Padalka]] who are guided by remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space. This study has a widespread impact and has been extended to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as medical students. It is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations. Findings from this study were submitted for publication to the journal [[Radiology]] aboard the International Space Station; the first article submitted in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html |title=Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM) |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2011-11-08 |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sishir Rao, BA, Lodewijk van Holsbeeck, BA, Joseph L.

=== Decreased immune system functioning ===
Astronauts in space have weakened immune systems, which means that in addition to increased vulnerability to new exposures, viruses already present in the body—which would normally be suppressed—become active.&lt;ref&gt;Pierson, D.L., Stowe, R.P., Phillips, T.M., Lugg, D.J. and Mehta, S.K., 2005. Epstein–Barr virus shedding by astronauts during space flight. Brain, behavior, and immunity, 19(3), pp.235-242.
&lt;/ref&gt; In space, [[T-cells]] do not reproduce properly, and the cells that do exist are less able to
fight off infection.&lt;ref&gt;Cogoli, A., 1996. Gravitational physiology of human immune cells: a review of in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro studies. Journal of gravitational physiology: a journal of the International Society for Gravitational Physiology, 3(1), pp.1-9.
&lt;/ref&gt; NASA research is measuring the change in the immune systems of its astronauts as well as performing experiments with T-cells in space.

On April 29, 2013, scientists in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, funded by [[NASA]], reported that, during [[spaceflight]] on the [[International Space Station]], [[microbes]] seem to adapt to the [[space environment]] in ways "not observed on Earth" and in ways that "can lead to increases in growth and [[virulence]]".&lt;ref name="PLos-20130429"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kim W, etal |title=Spaceflight Promotes Biofilm Formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0062437 |date=April 29, 2013 |journal=[[PLOS ONE]] |volume=8 |issue=4 |page=e6237 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0062437 |accessdate=July 5, 2013 |bibcode = 2013PLoSO...862437K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of fatigue ===
{{further|Fatigue and sleep loss during spaceflight}}

Astronauts and ground crews frequently suffer from the effects of [[sleep deprivation]] and [[Circadian rhythm#Disruption|circadian rhythm disruption]].  Fatigue due to sleep loss, sleep shifting and [[Occupational stress|work overload]] could cause performance errors that put space flight participants at risk of compromising mission objectives as well as the health and safety of those on board.

=== Loss of balance ===
Leaving and returning to Earth’s gravity causes “space sickness,” dizziness, and loss of balance in astronauts. By studying how changes can affect balance in the human body—involving the senses, the brain, the inner ear, and blood pressure—NASA hopes to develop treatments that can be used on Earth and in space to correct balance disorders. Until then, NASA’s astronauts must rely on a medication called [[Midodrine]] (an “anti-dizzy” pill that temporarily increases blood pressure), and/or [[promethazine]] to help carry out the tasks they need to do to return home safely.&lt;ref&gt;Shi, S. J., Platts, S. H., Ziegler, M. G., &amp; Meck, J. V. (2011). Effects of promethazine and midodrine on orthostatic tolerance. Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine, 82(1), 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spaceflight osteopenia]] is the [[Bone Loss|bone loss]] associated with [[human spaceflight]].&lt;ref name="Wired-20120723" /&gt; After a 3—4 month trip into space, it takes about 2–3 years to regain lost bone density.&lt;ref&gt;Sibonga, J.

Canadian Medical Association Journal, 180(13), 1317-1323.&lt;/ref&gt; New techniques are being developed to help astronauts recover faster. Research in the following areas holds the potential to aid the process of growing new bone:
* Diet and Exercise changes may reduce osteoporosis.
* Vibration Therapy  may stimulate bone growth.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkey, A. (2007). Low magnitude, high frequency signals could reduce bone loss during spaceflight. Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, 60, 278-284.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Medication could trigger the body to produce more of the protein responsible for bone growth and formation.

=== Loss of muscle mass ===
{{Main|Reduced muscle mass, strength and performance in space}}
In space, muscles in the legs, back, spine, and heart weaken and waste away because they no longer are needed to overcome gravity, just as people lose muscle when they age due to reduced physical activity.&lt;ref name="Wired-20120723" /&gt; Astronauts rely on research in the following areas to build muscle and maintain body mass:
* Exercise may build muscle if at least two hours a day is spent doing resistance training routines.
* Hormone supplements (hGH) may be a way to tap into the body’s natural growth signals.
* Medication may trigger the body into producing muscle growth proteins.

=== Orthostatic intolerance ===
In space, astronauts lose fluid volume—including up to 22% of their blood volume. Because it has
less blood to pump, the heart will [[atrophy]]. A weakened heart results in low blood pressure
and can produce a problem with “orthostatic tolerance,” or the body’s ability to send enough
oxygen to the brain without fainting or becoming dizzy. "Under the effects of the earth's [[gravity]], blood and other body fluids are pulled towards the lower body. When gravity is taken away or reduced during space exploration, the blood tends to collect in the upper body instead, resulting in facial [[edema]] and other unwelcome side effects. Upon return to earth, the blood begins to pool in the lower extremities again, resulting in [[orthostatic hypotension]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/25mar_dizzy.htm |title=When Space Makes You Dizzy |date=2002 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826230313/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/25mar_dizzy.htm |archivedate=2009-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sleep disorders ===

{{further|Performance Errors due to Fatigue and Sleep Loss}}
Fifty percent of space shuttle astronauts take sleeping pills and still get two hours or less of sleep. NASA is researching two areas which may provide the keys to a better night’s sleep, as
improved sleep decreases fatigue and increases daytime productivity.  A variety of methods for combating this phenomenon are constantly under discussion.  A partial list of remedies would include:
* Go to sleep at the same time each night. With practice, you will (almost) always be tired and ready for sleep.
*  [[Melatonin]], once thought to be an anti-aging wonder drug (this was due to the well-documented observation that as people age they gradually produce less and less of the hormone naturally). The amount of melatonin the body produces decreases linearly over a lifetime. Although the melatonin anti-aging fad was thoroughly debunked following a large number of randomized trials, it was soon in the spotlight once more due to the observation that a healthy person's normal melatonin levels varies widely throughout each day: usually, levels rise in the evening and fall in the morning. Ever since the discovery that melatonin levels are highest at bedtime, melatonin has been purported by some to be an effective sleep-aid – it is especially popular for jet-lag. Melatonin's efficacy in treating insomnia is hotly debated and therefore in the US it is sold as a dietary supplement. "These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA" is printed on the packaging even though melatonin has been studied very extensively.
* [[Ramelteon]], a melatonin receptor [[agonist]], is a relatively new drug designed by using the melatonin molecule and the shapes of melatonin receptors as starting points.  Ramelteon binds to the same M1 and M2 receptors in the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (the "biological clock" in the brain) as melatonin (M1 and M2 get their names from melatonin). It also may derive some of its properties from its three-times greater elimination half-life.  Ramelteon is not without detractors who claim that it is no more effective than melatonin, and melatonin is less expensive by orders of magnitude.  It is unclear whether Ramelteon causes its receptors to behave differently than they do when bound to melatonin, and Ramelteon may have a significantly greater [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for these receptors.  Better information on Ramelteon's effectiveness should be available soon, and despite questions of its efficacy, the general lack of side effects makes Ramelteon one of the very few sleep medications that could potentially be safely used by astronauts.
* [[Barbiturates]] and [[Benzodiazepines]] are both very strong sedatives.  While they certainly would work (at least short term) in helping astronauts sleep, they have side effects that could affect the astronaut's ability to perform his/her job, especially in the "morning."  This side effect renders barbiturates and benzodiazepines likely unfit as treatments for space insomnia.  Narcotics and most tranquilizers also fall into this category.
* [[Zolpidem]] and [[Zopiclone]] are sedative-hypnotics, better known by their trade names "Ambien" and "Lunesta".  These are extremely popular sleep-aids, due in large part to their effectiveness and significantly reduced side-effect profiles vis-a-vis benzodiazepines and barbiturates.  Although other drugs may be more effective in inducing sleep Zolpidem and Zopiclone essentially lack the sorts of side effects that disqualify other insomnia drugs for astronauts, for whom being able to wake up easily and quickly can be of paramount importance; astronauts who are not thinking clearly, are groggy, and are disoriented when a sudden emergency wakes them could end up trading their grogginess for the indifference of death in seconds.  Zolpidem, Zopiclone, and the like – in most people – are significantly less likely to cause drug-related daytime sleepiness, nor excessive drowsiness if woken abruptly.
* Practice good [[sleep hygiene]]. In other words, the bed is for sleeping only; get out of bed within a few moments of waking up.  ''Do not'' sit in bed watching TV or using a laptop.  When one is acclimated to spending many hours ''awake'' in bed, it can disrupt the body's natural set of daily cycles, called the [[circadian rhythm]].  While this is less of an issue for astronauts who have very limited entertainment options in their sleeping areas, another aspect of sleep hygiene is adhering to a specific pre-sleep routine (shower, brush teeth, fold up clothing, spend 20 minutes with a trashy novel, for example); observing this sort of routine regularly can significantly improve one's sleep quality.  Of course, sleep hygiene studies have all been conducted at 1G, but it seems possible (if not likely) that observing sleep hygiene would retain at least some efficacy in micro-gravity.
* [[Modafinil]] is a drug that is prescribed for narcolepsy and other disorders that involve excessive daytime exhaustion.  It has been approved in various military situations and for astronauts thanks to its ability to stave off fatigue.  It is unclear whether astronauts sometimes use the drug because they are sleep-deprived – it might only be used on spacewalks and in other high-risk situations.
* [[Dexedrine]] is an amphetamine which used to be the gold-standard for fighter pilots flying long and multiple sorties in a row, and therefore may have at some point been available if astronauts were in need of a strong stimulant. Today, Modafinil has largely – if not entirely – replaced Dexedrine; reaction time and reasoning among pilots who are sleep-deprived and on Dexedrine suffer, and get worse the longer the pilot stays awake.   In one study, helicopter pilots that were given six-hundred milligrams of Modafinil every three hours were able to perform with the same accuracy as they did at pre-deprivation levels for 40 hours without sleep; significant impairment would have been evident had the pilots been given Dexedrine instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA365558&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |title=The Effects of Modafinil on Aviator Performance During 40 Hours of Continuous Wakefulness |date=June 1999 |authors=John A.

== Spaceflight analogues ==
Biomedical research in space is expensive and logistically and technically complicated, and thus limited. Conducting medical research in space alone will not provide humans with the depth of knowledge needed to ensure the safety of inter-planetary travellers. Complimentary to research in space is the use of spaceflight analogues. Analogues are particularly useful for the study of immunity, sleep, psychological factors, human performance, habitability, and telemedicine. Examples of spaceflight analogues include confinement chambers ([[Mars-500]]), sub-aqua habitats ([[NEEMO]]), and Antarctic ([[Concordia Station]]) and Arctic ([[Haughton–Mars Project]]) stations.&lt;ref name="WIRED-20140212" /&gt;

'''''The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying''''', written by [[Sogyal Rinpoche]] in 1992, is a presentation of the teachings of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] based on the ''[[Bardo Thodol|Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'' or ''Bardo Thodol''. The author wrote, "I have written ''The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying'' as the quintessence of the heart-advice of all my masters, to be a new ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' and a ''Tibetan Book of Life''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rinpoche|first=Sogyal|title=The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying|year=2002|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-250834-2|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book explores: the message of impermanence; evolution, [[karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]; the nature of mind and how to train the mind through [[meditation]]; how to follow a spiritual path in this day and age; the practice of [[compassion]]; how to care for and show love to the dying, and spiritual practices for the moment of death.

In his foreword to the book, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] says: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In this timely book, Sogyal Rinpoche focuses on how to understand the true meaning of life, how to accept death, and how to help the dying, and the dead...Death and dying provide a meeting point between the Tibetan Buddhist and modern scientific traditions. I believe both have a great deal to contribute to each other on the level of understanding and practical benefit. Sogyal Rinpoche is particularly well placed to facilitate this meeting; having been born and brought up in the Tibetan tradition, he has received instructions from some of our greatest Lamas. Having also benefited from a modern education and lived and worked in the West, he has become well acquainted with Western ways of thought.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conception and writing==

===Background===
According to [[Daniel Goleman]], Rinpoche was already planning to write a book on living and dying in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel Goleman @ Garrison Institute, Meditation &amp; Science|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLCrFRGkijM|work=YouTube|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, he met [[Elizabeth Kübler-Ross]], [[Kenneth Ring]] and other figures in the caring professions and near-death research, and they encouraged him to develop his work in opening up the Tibetan teachings on death and helping the dying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=About_Rigpa Rigpa Wiki | About Rigpa]&lt;/ref&gt; Rinpoche continued to teach throughout the world. Then, in 1989 in Nepal, Rinpoche met [[Andrew Harvey (religious writer)|Andrew Harvey]] and invited him to help on the project.&lt;ref name="View"&gt;{{cite news |author=Patrick Gaffney |coauthors= |title=Finding the Voice |url= |quote= |work=View Magazine |date=Summer 1994 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing process===
Hundreds of hours of Sogyal Rinpoche's teachings on audio-cassettes were gathered and transcribed.&lt;ref name="View"/&gt;  In 1991, Andrew Harvey and [[Patrick Gaffney (Buddhist)|Patrick Gaffney]] moved into a small house in California, selected for the creative process, and close to Sogyal Rinpoche's residence. They began to draft the first chapters of the book based on Rinpoche’s oral teachings, regularly visiting Rinpoche, who would correct them and provide new ideas. More was done in London, but the most intense period of all began in Paris, at the end of 1991.&lt;ref name="View"/&gt;

Later, while Rinpoche was leading retreats in Germany and Australia, he would send through long faxes to Gaffney and Harvey full of corrections, changes and new paragraphs. He was testing the key chapters, for example on the Nature of Mind, the practice of meditation, compassion, Guru Yoga and [[Dzogchen]], by teaching them directly, again and again, all over the world in retreats and courses. Some parts were corrected and re-written twenty five times.&lt;ref name="View"/&gt;

The final changes were composed in July 1992, during the three-month retreat which Rinpoche conducted at his European retreat centre, [[Lerab Ling]], in France.  Of the process, Patrick Gaffney said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Probably, a book has never been written in such an unusual way. If it was difficult, it was because it presented so many challenges. One of the greatest was how to find Rinpoche's voice, that intimate, warm, clear and humorous voice that is so supremely eloquent when communicating live. Rinpoche is a master of the great oral tradition of Tibet, stretching back over centuries, the hallmark of which is the power to transmit directly, from heart to heart, mind to mind, in the medium of words, something which is beyond words.  There were other important issues. We implored Rinpoche to include his own personal experiences and memories from his life, which was an act of great daring for a Tibetan. Rinpoche wove in consciously, too, different layers of meaning which could be understood by people with different degrees of spiritual experience. Again, one of Rinpoche's greatest concerns was to ensure the authenticity of the teachings, and he fused into the book answers to questions about the teachings concerning death presented to His Holiness the Dalai Lama, [[Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]], and other great masters.”&lt;ref name="View"/&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Publication history==
''The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying'' was first launched in the United States in September 1992, where it received high acclaim and spent several weeks at the top of the bestseller lists.&lt;ref&gt;'Best Sellers'. ''The New York Times Book Review''. 3 January 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

It was subsequently released in the United Kingdom, Australia and India, and first translated into German and French. To date, more than two million copies have been printed in 30 languages and 56 countries.&lt;ref&gt;'''Translations:''' English, French, German, Chinese (Mainland China and Taiwan), Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Hebrew, Finnish, Turkish, Greek, Thai, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Croatian, Slovenian, Serbian, Hungarian, Estonian, Russian, Lithuanian, Czech, Bulgarian, Polish.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book’s success contributed to an expansion of the work of [[Rigpa]], the network of Buddhist centres and groups set up by [[Sogyal Rinpoche]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.rigpa.org/en/about-rigpa/history-of-rigpa/year-by-year-in-detail/1992-1996.html The History of Rigpa 1992-1996] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905060232/http://www.rigpa.org/en/about-rigpa/history-of-rigpa/year-by-year-in-detail/1992-1996.html |date=2011-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also prompted [[Rigpa]] to introduce a Spiritual Care Education and Training programme, providing for the needs of caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spcare.org/about History and Development of the Spiritual Care Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730123843/http://www.spcare.org/about/ |date=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major conference held at [[Germering]], near Munich in 1996 and involving several leading authorities on care for the dying, had a considerable influence on the emerging hospice movement in Germany.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

A revised edition was released in 2002 to celebrate the book's 10th anniversary. In 2012, a new and further revised edition was again, published.

==Criticism and reception==
[[Donald S. Lopez, Jr.]] characterized the book's many references to, and quotations from, prominent figures of Classical and European history as "cosmopolitan eclecticism",&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;{{cite book| last =Lopez Jr.| first =Donald S.| title =Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West| publisher =University Of Chicago Press| year =1998| page =79| url =| id = | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that Sogyal Rinpoche places Tibetan wisdom "in a global and ahistorical spiritual lineage of thinkers that no other Tibetan author has ever cited."&lt;ref name=Lopez /&gt; The religious studies scholar [[Huston Smith]] said, “I have encountered no book on the interplay of life and death that is more comprehensive, practical and wise. The perspective is forthrightly and profoundly Tibetan, but it is expounded so clearly that the reader has no trouble discerning on every page its universal import.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpercollins.com/book/index.aspx?isbn=9780062508348#CriticalPraise Harper Collins | Critical Praise]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has also received praise from a number of [[celebrity|celebrities]] and public figures, who have cited it as influential in their lives. Comedian [[John Cleese]] said the book was one of the most helpful he had ever read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tibetan Book Of Living And Dying|url=http://www.randomhouse.com.au/books/sogyal-rinpoche/tibetan-book-of-living-and-dying-9781846041051.aspx|work=Random House Books|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Musician [[Thom Yorke]] said, "It's the most extraordinary thing I've ever read" and "It felt like common sense from start to finish. I guess that's what wisdom is, really."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The View from the Stage|url=http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1957|work=Shambhala Sun|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish footballer [[Carles Puyol|Carles “Tarzan” Puyol]] is said to have taken a keen interest in [[Tibetan culture]] and Buddhism after reading ''The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying'' which helped him deal with the death of a family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spain's semi final hero fascinated by Buddhism, met Dalai Lama in 2007|url=http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=27719|work=Phayul|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

===Health care===
Since ''The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying'' was published, it has been adopted by institutions, centres and groups of various kinds, educational, medical and spiritual.&lt;ref name=TBLD&gt;{{cite book| last =Rinpoche| first =Sogyal| title =the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying| publisher =HarperCollins| year =2002| page =xii| url =| id = | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sogyal Rinpoche said in his introduction to the revised edition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Nurses, doctors, and those professionally involved with care for the dying have told me how they have integrated these methods in their daily work, and I have heard many accounts of ordinary people using these practices and finding that they transformed the death of a close friend or relative. Something I find especially moving is that this book has been read by people with different spiritual beliefs, and they have said that it has strengthened and deepened their faith in their own tradition. They seem to recognize the universality of its message, and understand that it aims not to persuade or convert, but simply to offer the wisdom of the ancient Buddhist teachings in order to bring the maximum possible benefit.”&lt;ref name=TBLD/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1993, an international programme of education and training called, Spiritual Care, was established by [[Christine Longaker]] and others in response to requests from healthcare professionals for practical ways to bring the compassion and wisdom of teachings in ''The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying'' into their work and lives. Over the past 17 years, they have worked with hospitals, hospices and universities, and trained more than 30,000 healthcare professionals and volunteers worldwide in all areas of healthcare and social services, and supported many people facing serious illness, death, or bereavement, and their families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spcare.org The Spiritual Care Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
*Director [[Stan Lai]], in his project with the Dharma Department of the National Institute of Arts, Taiwan, developed a 7-hour drama with as the starting point and central theme, a story that Rinpoche told in the book about “Patient Five” a woman who tells the story of her life as she faces imminent death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2000/05/18/0000036527 A Broader Canvas]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Australian composer, [[Nigel Westlake]]’s son was murdered just before the age of 21. Filled with grief he said, "When we lost Eli, I found myself obsessing about where he was and what we could do to help him," Westlake says. "I found great consolation in the Buddhist teachings of ''The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying''." When he could begin composing again, he started writing a [[requiem]] for his son. The text of the third movement, The Hymn of Compassion, contains excerpts of ''The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/composer-nigel-westlakes-requiem-for-murdered-son/story-e6frg8n6-1226007760677 Composer Nigel Westlake's requiem for murdered son]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[forensics|forensic investigation]], the '''time of occurrence''' of an event (such as time of death, time of incident) is one of the most important things to determine accurately as soon as possible. Sometimes this can only be estimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cienciaforense.com/pages/entomology/overview.htm#Estim|title = Forensic Entomology Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some indicators that investigators use are [[rigor mortis]], [[livor mortis]], [[algor mortis]], clouding of the [[cornea]]s, state of [[decomposition]], presence/absence of purged [[Bodily fluid|fluids]] and level of tissue [[desiccation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dplylemd.com/Articles/timelydeath.html|title=Timely Death|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515030306/http://www.dplylemd.com/Articles/timelydeath.html|archivedate=2007-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathologists can assume a time of death via analysing [[Carrion insects#Necrophagous species|necrophagous diptera]]. The odour from decaying flesh attracts different species as the stages of decomposition progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.inkling.com/read/fundamentals-of-forensic-science-houck-siegel-2nd/chapter-9/calculating-a-pmi|title = Fundamentals of Forensic Science|accessdate = September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Uterine rupture''' is a when the muscular wall of the [[uterus]] tears during [[pregnancy]] or [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name=Mur2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murphy |first1=DJ |title=Uterine rupture. |journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology |date=April 2006 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=135–40 |doi=10.1097/01.gco.0000192989.45589.57 |pmid=16601473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms while classically including increased pain, vaginal bleeding, or a change in [[uterine contraction|contractions]] are not always present.&lt;ref name=AFP2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lan2010&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lang |first1=CT |last2=Landon |first2=MB |title=Uterine rupture as a source of obstetrical hemorrhage. |journal=Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology |date=March 2010 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=237–51 |doi=10.1097/GRF.0b013e3181cc4538 |pmid=20142660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disability or death of the mother or baby may result.&lt;ref name=AFP2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mur2006/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Risk factors include [[vaginal birth after cesarean section]] (VBAC), other uterine scars, [[obstructed labor]], [[induction of labor]], [[Injury|trauma]], and [[cocaine]] use.&lt;ref name=AFP2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mir2009/&gt; While typically rupture occurs during [[Childbirth|labor]] it may occasionally happen earlier in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Mur2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP2002/&gt; Diagnosis may be suspected based on a rapid drop in the babies heart rate during labor.&lt;ref name=AFP2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mir2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mirza |first1=FG |last2=Gaddipati |first2=S |title=Obstetric emergencies. |journal=Seminars in Perinatology |date=April 2009 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=97–103 |doi=10.1053/j.semperi.2009.01.003 |pmid=19324238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uterine [[Wound dehiscence|dehiscence]] is a less severe condition in which there is only incomplete separation of the old scar.&lt;ref name=AFP2002/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Treatment involve rapid surgery to control bleeding and delivery the baby.&lt;ref name=AFP2002&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Toppenberg |first1=KS |last2=Block WA |first2=Jr |title=Uterine rupture: what family physicians need to know. |journal=American Family Physician |date=1 September 2002 |volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=823–8 |pmid=12322775}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[hysterectomy]] may be required to control the bleeding.&lt;ref name=AFP2002/&gt; [[Blood transfusion]]s may be given to replace blood loss.&lt;ref name=AFP2002/&gt; Women who have had a prior rupture are generally recommended to have [[C-section]]s in subsequent pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Larrea |first1=NA |last2=Metz |first2=TD |title=Pregnancy After Uterine Rupture. |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology |date=January 2018 |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=135–137 |doi=10.1097/AOG.0000000000002373 |pmid=29215521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of a rupture may be initially quite subtle. An old cesarean scar may undergo [[Wound dehiscence|dehiscence]];  but with further labor the woman may experience abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, though these signs are difficult to distinguish from normal labor. Often a deterioration of the fetal heart rate is a leading sign, but the cardinal sign of uterine rupture is loss of fetal station on manual vaginal exam. Intra-abdominal bleeding can lead to [[hypovolemic shock]] and death.   Although the associated maternal mortality is now less than one percent, the fetal mortality rate is between two and six percent when rupture occurs in the hospital.

In pregnancy uterine rupture may cause a viable [[abdominal pregnancy]]. This is what accounts for most abdominal pregnancy births.

* [[Abdominal pain]] and tenderness. The pain may not be severe; it may occur suddenly at the peak of a contraction. The woman may describe a feeling that something "gave way" or "ripped."
* [[Chest pain]], pain between the scapulae, or pain on inspiration—Pain occurs because of the irritation of blood below the woman's diaphragm
* [[Hypovolemic shock]] caused by haemorrhage— Falling blood pressure, [[tachycardia]], tachypnea, pallor, cool and clammy skin, and anxiety. The fall in blood pressure is often a late sign of haemorrhage
* Signs associated with fetal oxygenation, such as late deceleration, reduced variability, tachycardia, and bradycardia
* Absent fetal heart sounds with a large disruption of the placenta; absent fetal heart activity by ultrasound examination
* Cessation of uterine contractions
* [[Palpation]] of the fetus outside the uterus (usually occurs only with a large, complete rupture). The fetus is likely to be dead at this point.
* Signs of an abdominal pregnancy
* Post-term pregnancy

==Risk factors==
A uterine scar from a previous [[cesarean section]] is the most common risk factor. (In one review, 52% had previous cesarean scars.)&lt;ref name="pmid20230321"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chibber R, El-Saleh E, Fadhli RA, Jassar WA, Harmi JA |title=Uterine rupture and subsequent pregnancy outcome - how safe is it? A 25-year study |journal=J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med |volume= 23|issue= 5|pages= 421–4|date=March 2010 |pmid=20230321 |doi=10.3109/14767050903440489 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of uterine surgery that result in full-thickness incisions (such as a [[myomectomy]]), dysfunctional labor, labor augmentation by [[oxytocin]] or [[prostaglandins]], and high [[parity (medicine)|parity]] may also set the stage for uterine rupture.  In 2006, an extremely rare case of uterine rupture in a first pregnancy with no risk factors was reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walsh CA, O'Sullivan RJ, Foley ME |title=Unexplained prelabor uterine rupture in a term primigravida |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=108 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=725–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17018479 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000195065.38149.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
In an incomplete rupture the [[peritoneum]] is still intact. With a complete rupture the contents of the uterus spill into the peritoneal cavity or the [[broad ligament]].

==Treatment==
Emergency exploratory [[laparotomy]] with cesarean delivery accompanied by fluid and [[blood transfusion]] are indicated for the management of uterine rupture. Depending on the nature of the rupture and the condition of the patient, the uterus may be either repaired or removed (cesarean hysterectomy).  Delay in management places both mother and child at significant risk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1754">'''Validation therapy''' was developed by [[Naomi Feil]] for older people with [[cognitive impairment]]s and [[dementia]]. Feil's own approach classifies individuals with cognitive impairment as having one of four stages in a continuum of dementia. These stages are: 
*[[Orientation (mental)|Mal orientation]]
*[[Mental confusion|Time confusion]]
*[[Stereotypy|Repetitive motion]]
*[[Vegetative state]].

The basic principle of the therapy is the concept of [[Compliance (Psychology)|validation]] or the reciprocated communication of respect which communicates that the other's opinions are acknowledged, respected, heard, and (regardless whether or not the listener actually agrees with the content), they are being treated with genuine [[respect]] as a legitimate [[Emotional expression|expression of their feelings]], rather than marginalized or dismissed.

Validation therapy uses different specific techniques, and it has  attracted criticism from researchers who dispute the evidence for some of the beliefs and values of validation therapy, and the appropriateness of the techniques; as there are not enough quality evidences proving the [[efficacy]] of such method for people with dementia.&lt;ref name="pmid12917907"&gt;{{cite journal

'''William Marsh Rice''' (March 14, 1816 – September 23, 1900) was an American [[businessman]] who bequeathed his fortune to found [[Rice University]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]].

==Biography==
Rice was born in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Massachusetts]], the third of ten children of David and Patty (née Hall) Rice. His first job was as a grocery store clerk in Springfield, at the age of 15. By age 22, he had purchased the store from its owner. In 1838, Rice traveled to Texas in search of new business opportunities. Unfortunately, all the merchandise from his store was lost at sea, and Rice was forced to start anew in [[Houston]] as a clerk. He soon set up the Rice and Nichols general store with his business partner Ebenezer Nichols.&lt;ref name=tsha&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fri03 Rice, William Marsh] The Handbook of Texas History Online from the Texas State Historical Association website, Texas State Historical Association. Retrieved: 2013-06-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This business was the foundation for what would later become William M. Rice and Company.&lt;ref name=thresher72&gt;{{cite news|work=The Rice Thresher|date=April 27, 1972|page=3|last=McCants|first=J. T.|title=84 years of capitalism: the story of William M. Rice|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth245134/m1/3/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice made his fortune by investing in land, real estate, lumber, railroads, cotton, and other prospects in Texas and Louisiana. In 1860, his total property, which included fifteen slaves, was worth $750,000.&lt;ref name=tsha/&gt; He invested in business firms in Houston; in 1895 he was listed in the city directories as "Capitalist. Owner of [[Post Rice Lofts|Capitol Hotel]] and Capitol Hotel Annex Building, President of Houston Brick Works Company."&lt;ref name=thresher72/&gt; Rice was a member of the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows]].&lt;ref name=tsha/&gt;

Rice married Margaret Bremond, daughter of [[Paul Bremond]] ([[Houston and Texas Central Railway]]) and Harriet Martha Sprouls, in 1850 in Houston, Texas. The 1860 census places William and Margaret Rice in Houston's 2nd Ward. Clerks are also identified in the same census report; thus the location is most likely Rice's merchant business. Margaret was 16 years Rice's junior. She died, at age 31, in 1863 in Houston, Texas. Rice is also reported to have lived in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], Mexico in 1863. Whether there is a connection to the timing of Margaret's death to his living in Matamoros is not clear. By 1865, he was reported as living back in Houston.

He lived in Houston until around 1865, when he moved to New York (but did not own a home there). He built a house on a {{convert|160|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate in [[Dunellen, New Jersey]], and moved there in 1872. He became a resident of New York again in 1882.&lt;ref name=thresher72/&gt;

Rice married Julia E. Brown (nee Elizabeth Baldwin) on June 26, 1867. Baldwin was the sister of Charlotte Rice, the wife of William Rice's brother Frederick. The marriage was "stormy", and during the 1890s, she consulted an attorney regarding the possibility of a divorce. She died "hopelessly insane" in [[Waukesha, Wisconsin]], on July 24, 1896.&lt;ref name=thresher72/&gt;

On January 28, 1882, William Rice drafted a will, instructing the executors to pay over to the trustees, the Governor and the Judge, funds from his estate for the establishment of "The William M. Rice Orphans Institute." The next year, he began spending more time in Houston, reuniting with old acquaintances. After an 1886 or 1887 meeting with a C. Lombardi, Rice decided that the benefits of his wealth should be enjoyed by the children of the city where he made his fortune. In 1891, Rice decided that he would not establish an Orphans Institute at the Dunellen estate, but would instead found the William M. Rice Institute for the Advancement of Literature, Science and Art in Houston, Texas. The Institute's charter was signed by all the original trustees, except for Rice, on May 18, 1891, and certified by the State of Texas the following day.&lt;ref name=thresher72/&gt;

In 1893, Rice made a new will, naming as executors [[James A. Baker (born 1857)|James A. Baker Sr.]] (a lawyer who often worked for Rice), William M. Rice Jr. (his nephew), and John D. Bartine. The value of Rice's estate at the time was estimated at about $4 million. The new will instructed the executors to divide his property into two equal parts, one to be bequeathed to the Rice Institute, the other to be divided into shares and distributed to his wife Elizabeth Baldwin Rice and other legatees. After her death in 1896, a new will was drafted on September 26, providing bequests for several of Rice's relatives and leaving the remainder of the estate to the Rice Institute. The next four years saw a great deal of litigation by the will of Elizabeth Rice. Its executor was O. T. Holt, assisted by Albert T. Patrick, formerly an attorney in Houston, but working in New York at the time. Under a false identity, Patrick interviewed Rice, who would not otherwise have seen him due to his professional relationship with Elizabeth Rice. Patrick was attempting to establish Rice's domicile in Texas, and not in New York, which would have provided a more favorable bequest for Mrs. Rice. Despite revealing his identity in 1900, to Rice's anger, the two men continued to have dealings.&lt;ref name=thresher72/&gt;

Plotting to take control of Rice's estate and become the beneficiary of his fortune, Patrick prepared a fake will, forging Rice's signature on it. The fraudulent document named William Rice Jr. and James Baker Jr. as executors, but replaced John Bartine's name with Patrick's. He made bequests to a number of relatives and friends of Rice and of his own, hoping to involve as many interested parties as possible.&lt;ref name=thresher72/&gt; In the words of James A. Baker Sr.:

{{quote|...Mr. William M. Rice, Jr., the nephew of William Marsh Rice, and one of the attorneys of Mr. Rice (Captain Baker) were named as executors not only of the first, or genuine will of Mr. Rice, but in the second or so-called Patrick will; that each of them received greater benefits under the second will then {{sic}} under the first; and while he, Patrick, was named as residuary legatee under the second will, yet he was in fact a trustee, to take over the property of the estate and administer it in carrying out a number of secret trusts verbally declared by Mr. Rice.&lt;ref name=thresher72/&gt;}}

William Rice was living alone in his apartment at 500 Madison Avenue, New York. His valet, Charles F. Jones, had worked for him for a number of years.&lt;ref name=thresher72/&gt;

On September 24, 1900, James Baker received a telegram from the valet, Charles Jones, stating:

{{quote|Mr. Rice died last night under the care of a physician. Certificate of death old age, extreme nervousness. Funeral tomorrow morning at nine o'clock. Interment at Waukesha beside his wife. Wire when you are coming.&lt;ref name=thresher72/&gt;}}

Despite the contents of this telegram, a second communique, from Rice's bankers warned that the multi millionaire had died under peculiar circumstances, and that his body was to be [[cremation|cremated]].&lt;ref name=thresher72/&gt;

Court action would later prove that Jones and Patrick had conspired to murder Rice on September 23. The will was proved a forgery. Patrick was sentenced to death, spending four years on [[death row]] at [[Sing Sing Prison]] before having his sentence commuted by Governor [[Frank Higgins]] in 1906. He received a full pardon from Governor [[John Alden Dix|John A. Dix]] six years later. Patrick died in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] on February 11, 1940, aged 74.&lt;ref name=thresher72/&gt; Charles Jones was given freedom, and remained in seclusion until November 16, 1954. On that date, at age 79, he committed suicide in [[Baytown, Texas]], where he lived.&lt;ref name=thresher72/&gt;

Rice's body was eventually cremated, and the urn of his ashes was kept in the vault of the business office of the Trustees of the Institute until it was deposited beneath the monument erected in his memory on the campus of the Institute.&lt;ref name=thresher72/&gt; In 1930 [[John Angel (sculptor)|John Angel]] completed the Founder's Memorial at [[Rice University]] {{mdash}} depicting a seated William Marsh Rice {{mdash}} in line with specifications by architect [[Ralph Adams Cram]].&lt;ref name="Little"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/excerpts/exlitcom.html |title=A Comprehensive Guide to Outdoor Sculpture in Texas |first1=Carol Morris |last1=Little |publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] |year=1996 |page=248 |location=Austin, Texas |isbn=978-0-292-76034-9 |accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Rice was the victim of one of the earliest sensational crimes of the 1900s.  On September 23, 1900, Rice was found dead by his [[valet]], Charles F. Jones. He was presumed to have died in his sleep.  Shortly thereafter, a [[bank teller]] noticed a suspiciously large check bearing the late Rice's signature and made out to Rice's New York City lawyer, [[Albert T. Patrick]], but with Albert's name misspelled as "Abert".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exhibits.library.rice.edu/exhibits/show/founding/mistakes|title=Mistakes · William Marsh Rice and the Founding of Rice Institute · Woodson Research Center - Fondren Library -  Rice University|website=exhibits.library.rice.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon, Patrick made an announcement that Rice had changed his will right before his death, leaving the bulk of his fortune to Patrick rather than to his Institute. A subsequent investigation led by the District Attorney of New York resulted in the arrests of Patrick and of Rice's butler and valet Charles F. Jones, who had been persuaded to administer [[chloroform]] to Rice while he slept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Murdered Man's Estate Founds Great University |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1912/02/25/archives/article-14-no-title.html |quote=William Marsh Rice, an old Southern gentleman, died in a New York apartment on Sept. 23, 1900, several extraordinary consequences followed.

Patrick. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 25, 1912 |accessdate=2009-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Rice left the bulk of his estate to the founding of a free institute of higher education in [[Houston]], Texas. Opening in 1912 as ''William Marsh Rice Institute for the Advancement of Letters, Science, and Art'', it is known today as [[Rice University]].  In his will, Rice mandated that the university to bear his name would be for "whites only." This request was eventually overruled, and [[Raymond L. Johnson]] {{mdash}} Rice University's first black student {{mdash}} was admitted in 1969.

[[The Rice School]] in Houston is also named after William Marsh Rice.&lt;ref name="SchoolHistoriesHoustonISD"&gt;"[http://www.houstonisd.org/HISDConnectDS/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=0afe09c28afc3110VgnVCM10000028147fa6RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=2e2b2f796138c010VgnVCM10000052147fa6RCRD School Histories: the Stories Behind the Names]."
