An '''asset-backed commercial paper program''' ('''ABCP program''', '''ABCP Conduit''' or '''Conduit''') is a [[non-bank financial institution]] that issues short-term [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]], [[commercial paper]] called [[asset-backed commercial paper]] (ABCPs), to finance medium- to long-term [[asset]]s.&lt;ref name="swrt"&gt;Acharya, Viral, Philipp Schnabl and Gustavo Suarez (2010). Securitization Without Risk Transfer, September 2010, NBER Working Paper No. 15730&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like [[bank]]s, ABCP programs provide [[liquidity]] and maturity transformation services.&lt;ref name="efc"&gt;Covitz, Daniel, Nellie Liang and Gustavo Suarez (2009). The evolution of a financial crisis: Panic in the asset-backed commercial paper market. Division of Research &amp; Statistics and Monetary Affairs, Federal Reserve Board.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this structure, ABCP conduits are considered to be part of the [[Shadow banking system]].&lt;ref name="sb"&gt;Pozsar, Zoltan, Tobias Adrian, Adam Ashcraft and Hayley Boesky (2012). Shadow Banking. Staff Report No. 458. Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports&lt;/ref&gt; A common and prominent feature of many ABCP programs is that they were created by banks to fund bank assets in an off-[[balance sheet]] way, possibly to avoid regulatory [[capital requirement]]s.&lt;ref name="efc" /&gt; Due to this character, ABCP programs are cited as one of the reasons for the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008]].

In terms of terminology, ABCP usually refers to asset-backed commercial paper, while ABCP conduit (or conduit) the program. The [[Maturity (finance)|maturities]] of ABCP range up to 270 days but average about 30 days.&lt;ref name="efc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="frb"&gt;Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System. http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/cp/about.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ABCP programs first appeared in the mid-1980s. Initially, ABCP conduits were primarily sponsored by major [[commercial bank]]s as a means of providing [[trade receivable]] [[Finance|financing]] to their [[Corporation|corporate]] customers. Over the past decade, ABCP programs have grown to serve a wide variety of needs such as: asset-based financing for companies that cannot access the [[commercial paper]] market, warehousing assets prior to [[security]] issuance, investing in rated securities for arbitrage profit, providing leverage to [[mutual fund]]s, and off-[[balance sheet]] funding of bank [[asset]]s.&lt;ref name="imf"&gt;The Fundamentals of Asset-Backed Commercial Paper. Structured Finance Special Report. http://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2010/mcm/pdf/rutan1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Above all these service types, ABCP programs are commonly used by banks to free up their [[capital requirement|regulatory capitals]] by moving the seemingly safe assets off their balance sheet. Traditionally, banks keep everything on their balance sheet and owners of the bank have to hold a certain amount of [[equity (finance)|equity]] to meet the [[capital requirement]]. This means if a bank wants to [[investment|invest]] in a large new project, i.e. increase its asset largely, it has to increase owners' equity proportionality. Moving such project off bank's balance sheet eliminates the need of increasing equity. Through setting up ABCP conduits, banks can fund assets all by short-term [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]].

In general, any asset class that has been funded in the term market has been funded in a conduit, and there are a wide variety of assets that are unique to the conduit market, however, at the time of 2007, the major asset of most ABCP programs is [[asset-backed security]] backed by residential [[mortgage]]s.&lt;ref name="imf"/&gt;

As of September 2001, there were approximately 280 active ABCP programs, with more than $650 billion in outstanding.&lt;ref name="fr"&gt;Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Explained. Fitch Ratings. http://people.stern.nyu.edu/igiddy/ABS/fitchabcp.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-2000s, ABCP saw a steady rise in popularity because of their high ratings from the perspective of investors and the low borrowing rates from companies who need money. Gradually, even more conservative investors, such as [[Money market fund|money market mutual funds]] and retirement funds began purchasing ABCP. This optimism pushed the outstanding of ABCP to $1.3 trillion by the time of July 2007.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt; At that time, ABCP was the largest [[money market]] instrument in the United States, following by [[United States Treasury security|Treasury Bills]] with about $940 billion outstanding.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt; However, this trend came to an abrupt end in August 2007.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt;

During 2007, as negative information about U.S. residential mortgages spreads out, securities backed with mortgages, including [[sub-prime mortgage]]s, widely held by ABCP programs of financial firms globally, started to lose their value. ABCP investors started to worry about the value of the asset backing their ABCP and stopped rolling over their position. At the beginning, sponsor banks have enough liquid to pay off these liabilities, but lack of market confidence can create a  [[subprime mortgage crisis]].
 
On August 2007, the French bank [[BNP Paribas]] halted withdrawals from three funds invested in ABCP and suspended calculation of [[net asset value]]s. Even though [[Default (finance)|defaults]] on mortgages had been rising throughout 2007, the suspension of withdrawals by BNP Paribas has a profound effect on ABCP market. The interest rate spread of over-night ABCP and [[Federal funds rate]] increased from 10 [[basis point]]s to 150 basis points within one day of announcement.

Subsequently, the ABCP market experienced a modern-day [[bank run]]. Several ABCP conduits fall victims to liquidity crisis, and so are their sponsor [[financial institution]]s.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt; Since banks only need to keep regulatory capital for on-balance sheet assets, and none for the assets funded by ABCP conduits, they get into huge trouble paying back investors who refuse to roll over their ABCP. Several major financial institutions collapsed in the following year because of solvency issues and have to be bailed out by government.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt; See [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008]] for details on the crisis and see [[Great Recession]] for the recession triggered by the financial crisis.

In December 2007, ABCP outstanding dropped from $1.3 trillion to $833 billion.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt; By the end of 2008, there is no [[Structured investment vehicle|SIV]] left. As of March 2013, the outstanding of ABCP is about $300 billion.&lt;ref name="outstanding"&gt;Asset-backed Commercial Paper Outstanding. Federal Reserve Economic Data. http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/ABCOMP&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
An ABCP conduit is set up by a sponsoring [[financial institution]] (henceforth, sponsor). The sole purpose of a conduit is to purchase and hold [[financial asset]]s from a variety of asset sellers.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt; The conduit finances the assets by selling asset-backed commercial paper to outside investors such as [[money market fund]]s or other "safe asset" investors like retirement funds.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt;

Take the conduit Grampian as an example. Grampian is a conduit set up and managed by [[HBOS]]. HBOS's management responsibilities consist of selecting the assets (Airbus, mortgages, etc.) to be purchased by Grampian and issuing short-term ABCP in order to finance the assets. HBOS sells the ABCP to outside investors such as Fidelity and rolls over the ABCP at regular intervals.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt;

[[File:Structure of ABCP conduit.jpg|thumbnail|right|Structure of an ABCP conduit]]

As in banks, the [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] of assets in ABCP conduits generally is longer than the maturity of the [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]]. More than half of ABCP daily issuance has maturities of 1 to 4 days, referred to as "overnight", and the average maturity of outstanding paper is about 30 days.&lt;ref name="efc"/&gt; ABCP programs regularly roll over their liabilities and use proceeds from new issuances to pay off maturing [[commercial paper]]. [[Loan]] and lease receivables, which are assets commonly purchased by ABCP conduits, likely have terms of 30 days or more, and while relatively short, are still longer than most ABCP.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt; Most of the conduit assets are medium- to long-term assets with maturities of three to five years.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt;

===Financial institution (sponsor)===
The sponsors of the conduit play two roles: manage [[asset]]s and provide [[liquidity]]. Sponsor types range from large U.S. [[commercial bank]]s to non-bank institutions, like mortgage lenders and asset managers. Large U.S. banks have long sponsored ABCP programs, some smaller U.S. banks sponsor a very modest share. Foreign banks sponsor a substantial share of ABCP, about 40 percent in 2007. Non-bank institutions, such as mortgage lenders, finance companies, or [[Asset management|asset managers]], also sponsor a considerable share of the market. Programs sponsored by non-bank institutions grew more dramatically than other programs from 2004 to 2007, more than doubling in assets to $400 billion.&lt;ref name="efc"/&gt;
The ten largest sponsors as of January 2007 are:&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt;
#[[Citigroup]] (U.S.)
#[[ABN AMRO]] (Netherlands)
#[[Bank of America]] (U.S.)
#[[HBOS]] Pls (U.K.)
#[[JPMorgan Chase|JP Morgan]] (U.S.)
#[[HSBC]] (U.K.)
#[[Deutsche Bank|Deutsche Bank AG]] (Germany)
#[[Société Générale]] (France)
#[[Barclays]] Plc (U.K.)
#[[Rabobank]] (Netherlands)

Conduits can generate significant risks for the sponsor. The sponsor’s guarantee typically covers the conduit’s roll-over risk, which is the risk that a conduit cannot refinance maturing commercial paper, possibly because of a deterioration of conduit asset values. In that case, the sponsor has to assume the losses from lower asset values, because under the guarantee sponsors are required to repurchase assets [[Par value|at par]]. In exchange for assuming this risk, the sponsor receives the conduit profits.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt;

====Types of guarantees====
Conduit sponsors use four different types of guarantees which provide different levels of insurance to outside investors. The four types of guarantees, ranked from strongest to weakest, are full credit guarantees ("full credit"), full liquidity guarantees ("full liquidity"), extendible notes guarantees ("extendible notes"), and guarantees arranged via [[structured investment vehicle]]s (SIV).&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt;

;Full credit
Full credit guarantees are guarantees that require the sponsor to pay off maturing asset-backed commercial paper independent of the conduit's asset values. From a regulatory perspective, full credit guarantees are considered equivalent to on-[[balance sheet]] financing, because they expose banks to the same risks as assets on the balance sheet. Therefore, if the bank offer full credit guarantee, the backing assets will be on the balance sheet, thus are included in the calculation of [[Financial capital|capital]] needed to meet [[capital requirement]]. In practice, these guarantees are infrequently used by financial institutions that have to satisfy bank capital requirements.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt;

;Full liquidity
Full liquidity guarantees are similar to full credit guarantees with the main difference being that the sponsor only needs to pay off maturing asset-backed commercial paper if the conduit assets are not in [[default (finance)|default]]. Hence, there is a possibility that full liquidity guarantees expire before the asset-backed commercial paper matures. This form of guarantees is weaker than full credit, but from the bank's side, they can move these assets off the balance sheet.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt;

;Extendible notes
Extendible notes guarantees are similar to full liquidity guarantees with the main difference being that the conduit issuer has the discretion to extend maturing commercial paper for a limited period of time (usually 60 days or less). By extending the [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] of the commercial paper, it is more likely that the conduit's assets are in default before the commercial paper matures. From the viewpoint of an outside investor, extendible notes guarantees are therefore riskier than full liquidity guarantees. This guarantee was used by weaker financial institutions and by conduits with higher quality assets.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt;

;SIV
[[structured investment vehicle|SIV]] guarantees are also similar to full liquidity guarantees with the main difference being that SIV guarantees only cover a share of the conduit [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] (usually around 25%). Since SIV guarantees do not cover all conduit liabilities, they are considered partial insurance to outside investors. SIV guarantees were primarily used by commercial banks and other financial institutions to cover high quality assets.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt;

===Asset types===
The asset types that conduits invested in are mostly [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]] (ABS), [[Mortgage loan|residential mortgages]], [[Loan|commercial loans]] and [[Collateralized debt obligation|CDOs]]. Most of the assets are [[Bond credit rating|AAA-rated]], some holds un-rated assets generated by the sponsor financial institution.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt;  The asset origins are mostly United States (68%), Germany (15%) and United Kingdom (10%).&lt;ref name="gb"&gt;Acharya, Viral, Philipp Schnabl(2010). Do Global Banks Spread Global Imbalances&amp;quest; Asset-Backed Commercial Paper during the Financial Crisis of 2007–09. IMF Economic Review, 58(1), 37-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside investors===
The outside investors are mostly risk sensitive investors like [[money market fund]] and retirement funds.

==Benefits==
Originally, banks set up ABCP conduits to finance only safe assets off-balance sheet. Since these assets are considered safe, it is socially optimal for banks to invest more at a lower cost. ABCP conduit provides a way to free up regulatory capital, and thus achieve higher efficiency. At the same time, since safe assets are moved out of balance sheet, policy makers can target regulatory capital requirements only on the risky assets, which is what remains on the balance sheet.

==Costs==

However, due to no capital requirement for off-balance sheet assets, ABCP conduits also induce excessive risk taking. For example, banks may spread their capital very thin, and invest in highly risky projects that they would not have invested absent the mitigating effects of ABCP conduit on regulatory capital requirements. Especially when the sponsor bank is big, ABCP induces high [[moral hazard]]. When good state realized, the risky project will yield very high returns, but when bad state realized, the big bank expect government to [[bailout|bail it out]]. Therefore, banks optimally take on more risk because it does not care about the losses that occur in those states of nature when it goes [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]]. [[Creditor]]s will be bailed out and the [[interest rate]] at which the bank can borrow is therefore insensitive to bankruptcy risk. This is called "risk shifting"—shifting the risk from banks to the public. Most likely, policy makers find it optimal to bail out the bank, but needless to say, it is socially very costly.

==Risks==
Most conduits minimize their [[credit risk]] by holding a [[Diversification (finance)|diversified]] [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] of high quality assets. Typically, they are restricted to purchasing [[Bond credit rating|AAA-rated]] assets or unrated [[asset]]s of similar quality. Some conduits exclusively purchase unrated assets originated by their sponsoring financial institutions. Other conduits mostly purchase [[Securitization|securitized]] assets originated by other financial institutions. Many conduits combine the two strategies by purchasing both securitized and un-securitized assets from several financial institutions.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt;

Outside investors consider asset-backed commercial paper a safe investment for three reasons. First, the pool of conduit assets is used as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] to secure the asset-backed commercial paper. Second, the conduit's sponsor provides guarantees to the conduit, which ensures that the sponsor repays maturing ABCPs in case the conduit is unable to pay off the maturing paper itself. Third, ABCP is very short-term, so that investors can easily liquidate their investment by not rolling over maturing ABCPs.&lt;ref name="swrt"/&gt;

However, asset holdings of ABCP conduits, like at banks, are not transparent. While the vast majority of ABCP programs have credit ratings from the major [[Credit rating agency|rating agencies]], credit support mechanisms vary and the specific assets held in the programs are not widely known. For example, some ABCP programs viewed their holdings to be 'proprietary' investment strategies and deliberately did not disclose. Thus, random events or concerns about an economic downturn can create uncertainty about asset values. This uncertainty is greater when less information is available about the assets.&lt;ref name="efc"/&gt;

While ABCP programs are like banks, a key distinction, with important implications for financial stability, is that ABCP programs do not have explicit [[deposit insurance]] provided by the government. Most traditional ABCP programs are sponsored by commercial banks that provide explicit [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] support.&lt;ref name="efc"/&gt;

ABCP conduit induces regulatory arbitrage and excessive risk taking. With so few skin in the game, banks will increase their investments, and especially investments in risky projects with negative expected returns. The resulting high leverage and high risk will increase [[systemic risk]] of the [[financial system]], which further impose huge risk on the broader economy.

==Types==
There are five principal types of ABCP program:&lt;ref name="imf"/&gt;
*General purpose multi-seller
*Credit arbitrage
*[[Structured investment vehicle]] (SIV)
*Single-seller
*Loan-backed

===General purpose multi-seller===
The most traditional ABCP program is a multi-seller program, in which a conduit purchases [[Notes receivable|receivable]]s and [[loan]]s from multiple firms. The sponsor is typically a financial institution that provides the conduit with a committed [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] line, administers its daily operations, and sometimes also provides the conduit with credit enhancement through a letter of [[credit (finance)|credit]] that absorbs credit losses. At the end of July 2007, just before the widespread turmoil, there were 98 multi-seller programs in the U.S. ABCP market with outstanding of $525 billion, about 45 percent of total ABCP outstanding.&lt;ref name="efc"/&gt;

===Credit arbitrage===
These programs involve banks sponsoring conduits to finance long-term assets through a [[special purpose entity]] that has a lower [[Capital requirement|regulatory capital charge]] than if the assets were held on balance sheet. The sponsor banks typically provide full liquidity support. By using off-balance sheet funding, commercial banks exploit regulatory capital arbitrage opportunities. In July 2007, there were 35 programs that accounted for about 13 percent of the U.S. ABCP market.&lt;ref name="efc"/&gt;

===SIV===
SIVs fund highly rated [[Security (finance)|securities]]. But unlike the credit arbitrage programs, SIVs do not have explicit agreements with their sponsoring banks for committed back-stop [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] lines covering all their short-term [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]]. Instead SIVs relied on dynamic liquidity management strategies, which involved liquidating assets to pay investors if needed. At their peak in July 2007, there were 35 SIVs that accounted for $84 billion of U.S. ABCP. Some [[Asset-backed commercial paper|ABCP]] is issued by [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs), sometimes called SIV-lites. CDOs are similar to SIVs in structure, but are not actively managed and tend to rely on explicit but only partial liquidity support. There were 36 ABCP CDO programs in July 2007, with ABCP outstanding of $47 billion.&lt;ref name="efc"/&gt;

===Single-seller===
Single-seller programs involve a conduit that issues commercial paper backed by assets from only one originator, which frequently also sponsors the conduit. The majority of single-seller conduits mainly fund credit-card receivables, mortgages, [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]], or [[Loan|auto loans]]. Such programs tended not to have explicit liquidity support, but were thought to be implicitly supported by originators. In July 2007, there were 40 non-mortgage single-seller programs, about 11 percent of the U.S. ABCP market. There also were 11 mortgage single-seller programs that primarily warehoused mortgages prior to their [[securitization]].&lt;ref name="efc"/&gt;

===Loan-backed===
Loan-backed programs are bank-sponsored programs and fund direct loans to the bank's corporate customers. These loans are generally closely managed by the bank, and have a variety of covenants designed to reduce credit risk.&lt;ref name="imf"/&gt;

==Relation to 2008-09 global financial crises==
One feature of ABCP is that they provide the ability to fund bank [[asset]]s that do not appear on bank balance sheets. One result of keeping these assets off-balance sheet is that they do not factor in for regulatory [[capital requirements]].&lt;ref name="efc"/&gt; Thus the ABCP market may contribute to [[systemic risk]].&lt;ref name="efc"/&gt;

Before the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008-09 financial crises]], the [[global financial system]] "manufactured" risk-less assets, totaling over $1.2 trillion, by selling short-term ABCP to risk-averse investors, predominantly U.S. [[money market fund]]s, and investing the proceeds primarily in long-term U.S. assets.

As negative information about U.S. assets came to light in August 2007, banks experienced difficulties in rolling over ABCP and as a result several banks were [[Bailout|bailed out]] by the U.S. government.&lt;ref name="gb"/&gt; Reduced liquidity tightened credit, affecting production sectors. As a result, economic activity worldwide was slowed and international trade declined. Governments and [[central bank]]s responded with unprecedented [[fiscal stimulus]], [[monetary policy]] expansion and institutional bailouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somo.nl/publications-en/Publication_3588/at_download/fullfile |title=Kavaljit Singh, Fixing Global Finance:  A Developing Country Perspective on Global Financial Reforms, Stichting Onderzoek Multinationale Ondernemingen:  Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations,  at 14. |format=PDF |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420220424/http://www.somo.nl/publications-en/Publication_3588/at_download/fullfile |archivedate=April 20, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Astra Digital Radio Logo.svg|thumb|Astra Digital Radio]]
'''Astra Digital Radio''' ('''ADR''') was a system used by [[SES S.A.|SES]] for [[digital radio]] transmissions on the early [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellites, using the audio subcarrier frequencies of analogue television channels. It was introduced in 1995. As of February 2008, there were still 51 stations transmitting in this format.

==Details==
The format used one mono audio subcarrier, which was normally allocated to an additional audio track or radio station, or one channel of a stereo audio track/station. The carrier was digitally modulated and carried a 192&amp;nbsp;kbit/s, 48&amp;nbsp;kHz sampled [[MPEG-1 Layer II]] (MP2) encoded signal. 9.6&amp;nbsp;kbit/s was available for data.

Special receivers were required to listen to ADR stations, although some combined analogue/digital satellite boxes and later standard analogue boxes were equipped to decode it.

ADR was succeeded by [[DVB-S]], with which it is incompatible, despite both being transmitted using MP2 and generally at the same bitrates. As a result, when the final analogue switch-off on the Astra 1 satellites occurred, ADR became obsolete.

The majority of the channels to have been broadcast using ADR were in the [[German language]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} In some ways,{{which|date=July 2014}} the system is seen{{by whom|date=July 2014}} to have replaced the ''Digitales Satellitenradio'' system, dating from the 1980s, which used an entire satellite transponder to carry 16 [[NICAM]]&lt;ref&gt;Patent DE4234015A1 explicitly mentions DSR as an example for NICAM audio&lt;/ref&gt; encoded radio stations, and which closed in 1999.

The '''Bible of Kralice''', also called the '''Kralice Bible''' ({{lang-cs|Bible kralická}}), was the first complete translation of the [[Bible]] from the original languages into the [[Czech language]]. Translated by the [[Unity of the Brethren]] and printed in the town of [[Kralice nad Oslavou]], the first edition had six volumes and was published between the years 1579 and 1593. The third edition, from 1613, is classic and till this day the most widely known and used Czech translation. The [[New Testament]] had been translated from the Greek by [[Jan Blahoslav]] and published in 1564.

A '''Bosnian Muslim Republic''',{{Cref2|a}} that is, consolidation of Bosniak-inhabited territories into a [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] [[nation-state]], was proposed during the [[Bosnian War]] when plans for the [[partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] were made.

As noted by international relations expert Niels van Willigen: "Whereas the Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs could identify themselves with Croatia or Serbia respectively, the absence of a Bosniak state made the Bosniaks firmly committed to Bosnia as a single political entity."&lt;ref name="Willigen2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Niels van Willigen|title=Peacebuilding and International Administration: The Cases of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mt1fF1RbgngC&amp;pg=PP52|date=18 July 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-11725-3|pages=52–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Propaganda texts appeared in 1996, after the war, calling for a Bosniak state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=FBIS Daily Report: East Europe|issue=22–31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_e0TAQAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=The Service|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular Bosniaks have warned that a partition of the state would lead their people to Islamic fundamentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy Garton Ash|title=History of the present: essays, sketches and despatches from Europe in the 1990s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcktAQAAIAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-028318-1|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been [[Proposed secession of Republika Srpska|proposals of secession of RS]], as well as its abolition.

'''Castle Street''' (''Calle de la Cuesta'' or more popularly ''Calle Comedia'') is a road of the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. It runs to the east of the town, to the north of [[Flat Bastion Road]].

The street is also known as ''Calle Comedia'' as in the 19th century the street had a theatre in what had been a Real Tennis Court which was used for entertainment. This theatre was in use until the [[Theatre Royal, Gibraltar|Theatre Royal]] was built at [[Governor's Parade]].&lt;ref name="benady"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benady|first=Tito|title=The streets of Gibraltar : a short history|year=1996|publisher=Gibraltar Books|location=Grendon|isbn=0948466375|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3002">[[File:Thanaseff1933.jpg|thumb|''Les Histouères de Thanase Pèqueu'', published [[Rouen]] in 1933, a collection of stories in Cauchois by Gabriel Benoist.]]
'''Cauchois''' (Norman: ''Caucheis'') is one of the eastern dialects of the [[Norman language]], spoken in, and taking its name from, the [[Pays de Caux]] region of the [[Seine-Maritime]] départment.

==Status==

The Pays de Caux is one of the remaining strongholds of the Norman language outside the [[Cotentin]]. Statistics give a wide range of interpretations as to numbers of speakers: between 0.3%&lt;ref&gt;INSEE/INED, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and 19.1%&lt;ref&gt;''La Langue vivante'', Thierry Bulot, 2006 {{ISBN|2-296-01882-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; of residents of Seine-Maritime identify themselves as speakers of Cauchois.

==Phonology==
Among distinguishing features of Cauchois from other Norman dialects are:
*absence of /h/
*loss of [[:wiktionary:intervocalic|Intervocalic]] /r/
*a greater tendency to [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] than in western dialects; e.g. ''e(u)j'' instead of ''jé'' (English: ''I''), ''eud'' instead of ''dé'' (''of''), ''euq'' instead of ''qué'' (''that''), ''eul'' instead of ''lé'' (''the'')

==Literature==
[[File:Le Pucheux 2005.jpg|thumb|Literature in Norman is published in magazines, both in mainland Normandy and the Channel Islands, such as ''Le Pucheux'' from the Pays de Caux. This 2005 issue highlights language and literature from across the Norman-speaking regions.]]

The ''Purin'' literature of the 17th and 18th centuries, published in [[Rouen]], is the earliest Norman literature displaying Cauchois features.&lt;ref&gt;''La Normandie dialectale'', René Lepelley, Caen 1999, {{ISBN|2-84133-076-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Norman literary revival, which started in the Channel Islands and Cotentin in the 19th century, was not reflected in the Pays de Caux until the early years of the 20th century. From 1910 onwards a range of literature was produced; one of the features of Norman literature characteristic of Cauchois literature was the mixture of French and Norman. In Lower Normandy, Norman literature since the revival period has tended to be as exclusively Norman as possible. In the Pays de Caux, by contrast, alongside literature written exclusively in Cauchois, a genre of literature developed in which narrative is written in [[French language|French]] and dialogue in Cauchois, or else dialogue is written in French or Cauchois according to the language of the character.

Notable writers in Cauchois include [[Gabriel Benoist]] (author of the ''Thanase Pèqueu'' stories), Ernest Morel, Gaston Demongé, Maurice Le Sieutre and Marceau Rieul. Jehan Le Povremoyne (pseudonym of Ernest Coquin) wrote stories of the mixed dialogue genre, as did Raymond Mensire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3086">The '''Celtiberian confederacy''' was a tribal federation formed around the mid-3rd century BC, by the [[Arevaci]], [[Lusones]], [[Belli]] and [[Titii (Celtiberian)|Titii]], with the Arevacian city of [[Numantia]] as the federal capital. 

During the [[Second Punic War]] the confederacy kept itself neutral, though Celtiberian mercenaries are mentioned fighting for both sides on a number of occasions. The first Roman incursion into the celtiberian heartland occurred around 195 BC under [[Consul]] [[Cato the Elder]], who attacked unsuccessfully the towns of ''Seguntia Celtiberorum'' and Numantia,&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''Ab Urbe Condita'', 34: 19.&lt;/ref&gt; where he allegedly delivered a speech to the numantines.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Atticae'', 16: 1, 3. Though neither Livy or any other Greco-Roman sources make no reference to such a speech.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Upon the fall of Numantia in 134-133 BC, the Romans forcibly disbanded the Celtiberian confederacy and allowed the [[Pellendones]]’ and [[Uraci]] to regain their independence from the Arevaci, who were now technically submitted and absorbed into [[Hispania Citerior]] province.

[[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] are both members of the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. Both joined the EU simultaneously on 1 May 2004. They also both joined NATO  on 12 March 1999.

'''''Decadence: The Meaninglessness of Modern Life''''' is a six-part [[television]] [[documentary film|documentary]] series commissioned by [[SBS Independent]] and produced by Fork Films. The series is hosted by [[Pria Viswalingam]], who is best known for his work on the travel show ''[[A Fork in the Road]]''.&lt;ref name=smh/&gt; Decadence was originally broadcast on the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS) of Australia in 2006 in the form of six, thirty-minute-long episodes (including advertisements). It was re-screened again in 2007 as part of the SBS season on [[globalisation]].

The series examined the decadence and meaninglessness of modern, western life.&lt;ref name=galvin&gt;{{cite news |author=Galvin, Peter |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/review/decadence-review |title=Review: It's the end of the world as we know it |work=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=18 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also posed the question: 'If we live in such a great and prosperous world, and we are living longer, better, and healthier than before, why are we so unhappy?' There were interviews with prominent experts and leaders in their fields throughout the series including [[John Tirman]], Cardinal [[George Pell]], [[Avner Offer]], [[Susan Greenfield]], [[Phillip Knightley]], [[Kishore Mahbubani]], [[Noam Chomsky]],&lt;ref name=galvin/&gt; and [[John Spong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/fall-of-an-empire-this-is-as-good-as-it-gets-20111130-1o6t5.html|last=Viswalingam |first=Pria |subject-link=Pria Viswalingam |interviewer=Sacha Molitorisz |title=Fall of an empire: this is as good as it gets |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=1 December 2011 |access-date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viswalingam interviewed New South Wales Police Commissioner [[Ken Moroney]] about the extent to which many cases of rape have become particularly violent and gruesome, and asked why sex crimes are growing in number in society. The link between violent pornography and sex crimes was also examined in this episode. A medical ethicist Dr. Amin Abboud noted that sex had been trivialized and needed to be placed back into the context of emotional connections and intimacy and that sex should be rediscovered as part of love. In an interview, [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Rabbi]] [[Shmuley Boteach]]&lt;ref name=smh/&gt; stated that modern relationships collapse when people lose interest in the sex and that sex has become the sole measure and importance in a relationship.

'''Galaxy 27''' is a [[communications satellite]] owned by [[Intelsat]]. It was at first located at [[129th meridian west|129°&amp;nbsp;W]] [[longitude]], serving most of the [[North America]]n market.&lt;ref&gt;{{satbeams footprint|5712|Galaxy-27 Ku-band Beam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{satbeams footprint|5711|Galaxy-27 C-band Beam}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built by [[Space Systems/Loral]], as part of its [[LS-1300|FS-1300]] line.  Galaxy 27 was formerly known as '''Intelsat Americas 7''' and '''Telstar 7'''.

This satellite experienced a power failure of several days in 2004 and returned to service with reduced capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Gunter's Space Page - information on [http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/telstar-5.htm Galaxy 27]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, Galaxy 27 was redeployed to [[45th meridian east|45.1° E]] longitude in order to expand Intelsat's services in the Middle East and West Asia.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} In October 2013, Intelsat moved the satellite to an [[inclined orbit]] at [[66th meridian east|66° E]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=intelsat 17 66 East Satellite &amp; Digital TV Support forums|publisher=www.satellites.co.uk|date=October 2, 2013|url=https://www.satellites.co.uk/forums/threads/intelsat-17-66-east.155145/page-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its inclined orbit of 2.4° at 66°&amp;nbsp;E, Galaxy 27 is in a [[Co-location (satellite)|collocated]] orbit with [[Intelsat 17]].

'''''I Dreamed of Africa''''' is a memoir by [[Italy|Italian]] writer [[Kuki Gallmann]]. The book focuses on Gallmann's lifelong interest in [[Africa]]. 

==Plot==
The memoir ranges from her childhood's fascination with the continent (whence the title) to her 1972 decision to relocate to [[Kenya]] to run a farm in the [[Laikipia District|Laikipia]] plain with her husband and son. Gallmann published the book in 1991, twenty years after moving to Kenya, and she chose to write it in [[english language|English]] as this was by then her adoptive language.&lt;ref&gt;K. Gallman, preface to ''Sognavo l'Africa'' (italian edition of ''I dreamed of Africa'')&lt;/ref&gt; The book is often compared to [[Karen Blixen]]'s ''[[Out of Africa]]'', as the subject has several traits in common, and the setting is, in both cases, the [[savannah]]s of Kenya, in the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]] area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/I-Dreamed-Africa-Kuki-Gallmann/dp/0140287442 I Dreamed of Africa] data and reviews at Amazon.com (notice that "Isak Dinesen" is the pen name of K. Blixen).&lt;/ref&gt; The 2000 [[I Dreamed of Africa|movie of the same title]], starring [[Kim Basinger]] and directed by [[Hugh Hudson]], is based on the book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">'''John Barratier''' was an 18th-century [[child prodigy]]. The following note describing him appears in a letter to the [[British Royal Society]] November 28, 1769:

"John Barratier hath been most particularly distinguished, who is said to have understood [[Latin language|Latin]] when he was but four years old, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] when six, and three other [[languages]] at the age of nine.

This same prodigy of philosophical learning also translated the travels of [[Benjamin of Tudela|Rabbi Benjamin]] when eleven years old, accompanying his version with notes and dissertations. Before his death, which happened under the age of twenty, Barratier seems to have astonished [[Germany]] with his amazing extent of learning; and it need not be said, that its increase in such a soil, from year to year, is commonly amazing."

This comment was made as part of a longer letter submitted by the Honourable Daines Barrington describing "a very remarkable young musician" [[Mozart|Joannes Chrysostomus Wolgangus Theophilus Mozart]].

Barratier died before the age of 20.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, Stephen Jay]]. ''Eight Little Piggies: Reflections in Natural History''. New York: Norton, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leopoldo Alfonso "Leo" Villa''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (30 November 1899 – 18 January 1979) was the long-serving mechanic of [[Malcolm Campbell|Sir Malcolm Campbell]] and [[Donald Campbell]]. He was born in London, of Italian and Scottish parents.&lt;ref name="Villa, Life with the Speed King" &gt;[[#Villa, Life with the Speed King|Villa, Life with the Speed King]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and early career==
Villa was born in London to an Italian father and a Scottish mother. A gifted artist Villa drew many pictures of an automotive nature and through his uncle he found employment as a [[riding mechanic]] with the Italian racing driver [[Giulio Foresti]] who held the British franchise for the [[Italia]] automobile. Between 1915 and 1922 Villa and Foresti were lucky to escape serious injury after a number of serious incidents when motor racing, however during preparations for the French [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] at [[Strasbourg]] in which Foresti was to drive a French [[Ballot (automobile)|Ballot]] Villa's luck ran out when he was seriously burnt when a generator exploded. After a period of convalescence in England Villa found himself on the shelf after Foresti had taken on another mechanic in Villa's absence.&lt;ref name="man"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Donald Campbell: The Man Behind The Mask |first=David |last=Tremayne |publisher=Bantam Press |location=London |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-55381-511-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Record breaking==
Not so long after Villa had an offer that would set the path of his career for the rest of his life. The then Captain [[Malcolm Campbell]] owned the franchise for Ballot in England and raced one of its models at [[Brooklands]] and was considering buying a new model for a Grand Prix campaign so Foresti and Villa were despatched with the car that French star [[Jules Goux]] had driven in the Grand Prix Villa had missed. Campbell was so impressed with Villa's manner and ability he offered him a job and though he was very much so Campbell's employee Villa was to be a key part in Malcolm Campbell's nine land and four water world speed record attempts. Not long after Sir Malcolm's death on New Year's Eve 1948 Villa was approached by Sir Malcolm's son [[Donald Campbell]] with a proposition, the junior Campbell had heard that the Americans were planning an attempt on his fathers world water speed record and the fiercely patriotic Campbell wanted to push it out of their reach before they even got started. The older and wiser Villa wasn't against such an idea he did however advise that record breaking wasn't as easy as Campbell thought it was and once Campbell got started he would be addicted for life. The headstrong young Campbell wasn't to be dissuaded and so Villa found himself again playing chief mechanic to a Campbell's many record attempts. However this time round far from being just an employee Villa's relationship with the young Campbell was on a much more even keel having watched Campbell grow up and having covered for him on numerous occasions so as he didn't suffer the wrath of Sir Malcolm he was held in great affection by Donald who regularly referred to him as Unc. After a somewhat rocky start to record breaking with Sir Malcolm's old boat [[Blue Bird K4]] and a considerable investment by Campbell and others they managed to get their first world water speed record as a team on [[Ullswater]] in 1955 with a jet engined [[hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]] called Bluebird K7. Campbell proved to be as adept at record breaking as his father and he went on to set no fewer than 7 world water speed record and 1 world land speed record with Villa being instrumental in every one. It was a successful partnership that was only broken upon Campbell's death in 1967 whilst attempting his eighth world water speed record.&lt;ref name="man" /&gt;

==Later life and death==
After Campbell's death Villa spent his time at home in Reigate in Surrey with his wife Joan where he took up gardening. He received an OBE in June 1976 for services to land and water speed records, Villa was also granted [[The Freedom of the City]] of London and he went on to write three books about his record breaking career, two of them written with Kevin Desmond. Villa died in January 1979 from lung cancer eight months after the death of his wife Joan.&lt;ref name="leo"&gt;{{cite book |title=Leo Villa's Bluebird Photo Album |first=David |last=de Lara |location=Isleworth |publisher=Transport Bookman |year=2007 |isbn= 978-0-85184-071-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Libya–European Union relations''' are the foreign relations between the country of [[Libya]] and the [[European Union]]'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;Although there has been a large degree of [[European integration|integration]] between [[European Union]] [[Member state of the European Union|member states]], foreign relations is still a largely intergovernmental matter, with the 28 members controlling their own relations to a large degree.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} However, with the Union holding more weight as a single bloc, there are at times{{vague|date=June 2016}} attempts to speak with one voice, notably on trade and energy matters. The [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] personifies this role.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], the EU and Libya were negotiating a cooperation agreement which has now been frozen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eeas.europa.eu/libya/index_en.htm Libya], European Commission&lt;/ref&gt; The EU worked to apply sanctions over the Libyan conflict, provide aid and some members participated in military action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/news/external_relations/110310_1_en.htm Developments in Libya: an overview of the EU's response], European Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of European-Libyan Affairs==
Libya has had a long and tumultuous relationship with mainland Europe.

=== The Greek, Persian, Carthaginian, and Roman Empires ===
In 630 BCE, the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] colonized Eastern Libya and founded the city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]].&lt;ref&gt;Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress, (1987), [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ly0015) "Cyrenaica and the Greeks"], ''U.S. Library of Congress''. Retrieved 11 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Within 200 years, four more important Greek cities were established in the area that became known as [[Cyrenaica]]. The Greeks of the Pentapolis resisted encroachments by the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians from the East, as well as by the Carthaginians from the West, but in 525 BCE the Persian army of [[Cambyses II]] overran Cyrenaica, which for the next two centuries remained under Persian or Egyptian rule. [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] was greeted by the Greeks when he entered Cyrenaica in 331 BCE, and Eastern Libya again fell under the control of the Greeks, this time as part of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]].  [[Carthage|The Carthaginian Empire]] rose to power to hold sway over the coast of much of modern-day Libya, but was later enveloped into the [[Roman Empire]] after the [[Punic Wars]].

===The Ottoman Empire and Fascist Italy===
Libya was part of the Ottoman Empire, which fell apart following the events of [[WWI]].  From 1912 to 1943, Libya was controlled by [[Italy]].  Italy lost the land during the North African Campaign of WWII.  The United Kingdom and France administered the region until on 24 December 1951, Libya declared its independence as the [[United Kingdom of Libya]].

===The Second Libyan Civil War and the European Migrant Crisis===
Prior to the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], the EU and Libya were negotiating a cooperation agreement which has now been frozen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eeas.europa.eu/libya/index_en.htm Libya], European Commission&lt;/ref&gt; The EU worked to apply sanctions over the Libyan conflict, provide aid and some members participated in military action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/news/external_relations/110310_1_en.htm Developments in Libya: an overview of the EU's response], European Commission&lt;/ref&gt;  The ongoing Second Libyan Civil War and European Migrant Crisis are causing tensions on both sides of the Mediterranean.

==The Malta Declaration==
The [[Malta Declaration (EU)]] is a declaration made on 3 February 2017 during the [[European migrant crisis]] by leaders of the [[European Union]] in [[Malta]], which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union, that focuses on measures to stem the flow of [[immigration]] from [[Libya]] to [[Italy]] and the EU.&lt;ref name=consilium1&gt;{{cite web|title=Informal meeting of EU heads of state or government, 03/02/2017 - Consilium|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/european-council/2017/02/03-informal-meeting/|website=www.consilium.europa.eu|accessdate=4 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kanter|first1=James|title=E.U.

The EU is closely working with Libya on the safety of migrants with such actions as [[Operation Sophia]] and the training of Libyan Coast Guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euneighbours.eu/en/south/stay-informed/news/migration-mogherini-pushes-valletta-action-plan-forward-and-concludes|title=Migration: Mogherini pushes Valletta Action Plan forward and concludes first training of Libyan coastguards {{!}} EU Neighbours|website=www.euneighbours.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maakhir University''' ({{lang-so|Jaamacada Maakhir}}, {{lang-ar|جامعة ماخر}}) is a university in the northern [[Sanaag]] ([[Maakhir]]) region of [[Somalia]].

==Overview==
Situated in [[Badhan, Sanaag|Badhan]], the college was established in 2009 with the purpose of providing affordable higher education to residents of the province and elsewhere in the nation. According to the institution's website, Maakhir University offers undergraduate degrees with the ultimate goal of contributing to the development of Somali society.

The Sanaag/Maakhir diaspora community has been the university's main sponsor since the outbreak of Somalia's [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130127110910/http://lasqoraytimes.com/jaaliyada-reer-maakhir-ee-imaraadka-oo-ugu-deeqay-gaadhi-maakhir-university Jaaliyada Reer Maakhir ee Imaraadka Oo ugu Deeqay Gaadhi Maakhir University]&lt;/ref&gt; Members purchased equipment from abroad, which they then sent to the institution. The latter contributions include vehicles and office equipment. Expatriates from the region have also contributed to the construction of a new university campus, a project that has been in the works for the last couple of years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spr.fm/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1325:maakhir-university-a-guiding-light-in-a-maze-of-darkness&amp;Itemid=123 Maakhir University; a Guiding Light in a Maze of Darkness]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, through its representative to [[Kuwait]], [[Faisal Hawar]], the [[Puntland]] government signed an agreement in [[Dubai]] with a Kuwaiti company for the development of facilities at Maakhir University as well as the [[Garowe International Airport]]. The deal was valued at $10 million USD and was financed by the [[Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development]] (KFAED).&lt;ref name="Skctcauip"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: Kuwaiti Company to construct Airport, University in Puntland |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia-Kuwaiti-Company-to-construct-Airport-University-in-Puntland.shtml |accessdate=29 September 2014 |agency=Garowe Online |date=14 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416090203/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia-Kuwaiti-Company-to-construct-Airport-University-in-Puntland.shtml |archivedate=April 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2541">The '''Movement for Democracy in Liberia''' ('''MODEL''') was a rebel group in [[Liberia]] that became active in March 2003, launching attacks from [[Ivory Coast]]. MODEL was based on the Force Spéciale pour la Libération du Monde Africain (LIMA) militia formed in September 2002 to help [[Laurent Gbagbo]]'s government against insurgents backed by Liberia's president [[Charles G. Taylor|Charles Taylor]]. After fighting off the imminent threat, parts of LIMA crossed the border to Liberia to continue the war there. With Taylor's forces already pressed against the larger [[Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy]] (LURD), MODEL achieved rapid territorial gains. While it was initially thought that MODEL was a splinter group of LURD, this was not the case. While the initial leadership of MODEL came from LURD, the majority of MODEL fighters were mobilized from Ivorian and Ghanaian refugee camps to which many Liberians from the country's Southeast had fled to. The relationship between the rebel groups too was strained, with politicians from both movements trying to make certain that cooperation would remain difficult.&lt;ref name="Taylor Must Go"&gt;Ilmari Käihkö. ''Taylor must go' - The strategy of the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy'', Small Wars &amp; Insurgencies March 2015 vol. 26 no. 2 248-270, page 259. |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09592318.2015.1007561#abstract.&lt;/ref&gt; 

MODEL was backed by the Ivorian government as a way of staking a claim in Liberian politics during the turmoil of that country's civil war, or as retaliation for the Liberian government's alleged support for rebels in Ivory Coast. Its political leader, [[Thomas Nimely]], was named as Liberia's foreign minister in the transitional government that was appointed on October 14, 2003, following the resignation and exile of Taylor.  The group may have exported timber from regions of southern Liberia under its control, which would have been a violation of [[United Nations]] sanctions. By 2004 MODEL in effect ceased to exist.

The '''Măzărache Church''' ({{lang-ro|Biserica Măzărache}}) is a church in [[Chişinău]], [[Moldova]].

== Overview ==

The Măzărache Church is considered to be the oldest in Chişinău, erected by [[Vasile Măzărache]] in 1752. It is a monument built according to the typical indigenous medieval [[Moldavian architecture]] of the 15-16th centuries; the church was built on the place on a fortress destroyed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the 17th century. 

The stone block marking the location of the water spring that gave name to Chişinău is set at the foot of the hill upon which stands Măzărache Church. The name of the spring - "chisla noua" - is believed to be the archaic [[Romanian language|Romanian]] for "new spring".

The '''National Union PSD+PUR''' ({{lang-ro|Uniunea Națională PSD+PUR}}) was an [[electoral alliance]] in [[Romania]] in 2004.

==History==
The alliance was formed between the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) and the [[Humanist Party of Romania]] (PUR) as a counterpart to the [[Justice and Truth|Justice and Truth Alliance PNL-PD]], only for the [[Romanian legislative election, 2004|2004 legislative elections]] and [[Romanian presidential election, 2004|Romanian presidential election]].

The two parties - by then PSD and [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservative Party]] - also decided to form a political alliance for the [[Romanian legislative election, 2008|2008 general elections]], called [[Alliance PSD+PC]], reflecting the Humanist Party's change of name.

'''New Zealand''' ({{lang-mi|[[Aotearoa]]}} {{IPA-mi|aɔˈtɛaɾɔa|}}) is a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] [[island country]] in the southwestern [[Pacific Ocean]]. The country  geographically comprises two main landmasses—the [[North Island]] (''Te Ika-a-Māui''), and the [[South Island]] (''Te Waipounamu'')—and around 600 [[List of islands of New Zealand|smaller islands]]. New Zealand is situated some {{convert|1500|km|-2}} east of [[Australia]] across the [[Tasman Sea]] and roughly {{convert|1000|km|-2}} south of the [[Pacific Islands|Pacific island areas]] of [[New Caledonia]], [[Fiji]], and [[Tonga]]. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|biodiversity]] of animal, fungal, and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the [[Southern Alps]], owe much to the [[tectonic uplift]] of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's [[Capital of New Zealand|capital city]] is [[Wellington]], while its most populous city is [[Auckland]].

Sometime between 1250 and 1300, [[Polynesians]] settled in the islands that later were named New Zealand and developed a distinctive [[Māori culture]]. In 1642, Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]] became the first European to sight New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the United Kingdom and [[Māori people|Māori]] chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which declared British sovereignty over the islands. In 1841, New Zealand [[Colony of New Zealand|became a colony]] within the [[British Empire]] and in 1907 it [[Dominion of New Zealand|became a dominion]]; it gained [[Independence of New Zealand|full independence]] in 1947, but the British monarch remained the [[head of state]]. Today, the majority of [[New Zealanders|New Zealand's population]] of 4.8 million is of [[European New Zealanders|European descent]]; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by [[Asian New Zealanders|Asians]] and [[Pacific Islander]]s. Reflecting this, [[Culture of New Zealand|New Zealand's culture]] is mainly derived from Māori and early British settlers, with recent broadening arising from increased [[Immigration to New Zealand|immigration]]. The [[Languages of New Zealand|official languages]] are [[English language|English]], [[Māori language|Māori]], and [[New Zealand Sign Language|NZ Sign Language]], with English being very dominant.

New Zealand [[international rankings of New Zealand|ranks highly]] in international measurements of [[developed country|human development]], quality of life, education, government transparency, [[civil liberties]], and [[economic freedom]]. The country underwent [[Rogernomics|major economic changes]] during the 1980s, which transformed it from a [[protectionist]] to a [[economic liberalization|liberalised]] [[free-trade]] economy. The service sector dominates the [[Economy of New Zealand|national economy]], followed by the industrial sector, and [[Agriculture in New Zealand|agriculture]]. International [[tourism in New Zealand|tourism]] is a significant source of revenue.

Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], while executive political power is exercised by the [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]], led by the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]], who is currently [[Jacinda Ardern]].

'''Portugal''' was present at the '''Eurovision Song Contest 1986''', held in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]]. 

The Portuguese national final to select their entry, the ''Festival RTP da Canção 1986'', was held on 22 March at the [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal]] Studios in [[Lisbon]], and was hosted by [[Henrique Mendes]] and [[Maria Helena Fialho Gouveia]], who hosted the very first Portuguese Contest in 1964. 

Mendes and Fialho Gouveia introduced and made light commentary on the songs, which were taped in advance for the television audience. Each television region in Portugal ([[Ponta Delgada]], [[Funchal]], [[Porto]] and [[Lisbon]]) submitted three songs for this year's Festival. An "expert" jury decided the winner, and only the placement of the top three songs were made public.

The winning entry was one of the songs from Lisbon, "[[Não sejas mau para mim]]," performed by [[Dora (singer)|Dora]] and composed by [[Guilherme Inês]], [[Zé Da Ponte]], and [[Luís Manuel de Oliveira Fernandes]].

==At Eurovision==
Dora was the twentieth and last performer on the night of the contest, following [[Finland]]. At the close of the voting the song had received 28 points, placing 14th in a field of 20 competing countries. Despite its low placing, it would be the highest rank Portugal would receive in the Contest between 1985 and 1990.

'''Cape Verde''' was a [[colony]] of the [[Portuguese Empire]] from the initial settlement of the Cape Verde Islands in 1462 until the independence of [[Cape Verde]] in 1975.

==History==
{{main|History of Cape Verde#Portuguese discovery and colonisation}}

=== 15th century ===

The islands of Cape Verde were discovered between 1460 and 1462 by Portuguese and Genoese sailors in the service of the Portuguese Crown. The southeastern islands, including the largest island [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]], were discovered in 1460 by [[António de Noli]] and [[Diogo Gomes]]. The remaining northwestern islands [[São Nicolau, Cape Verde|São Nicolau]], [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|São Vicente]] and [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santo Antão]] were discovered in 1461 or 1462 by [[Diogo Afonso]].&lt;ref name=gomes&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/11328/594 Valor simbólico do centro histórico da Praia], Lourenço Conceição Gomes, Universidade Portucalense, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|73}} There is no evidence of human settlement on Cape Verde prior to the arrival of the Portuguese.&lt;ref name=gomes/&gt;{{rp|77}}

In 1462, the town of Ribeira Grande (now [[Cidade Velha]]) was founded on the south coast of Santiago.&lt;ref name=gomes/&gt;{{rp|77}} The settlement became a key port of call for Portuguese colonisation towards Africa and South America. In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was a centre of maritime trade between Africa, the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]], [[Brazil]] and the [[Caribbean]]. Due to its proximity to the African coast, it was an essential platform for the trade of enslaved persons.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Cidade Velha, Historic Centre of Ribeira Grande - UNESCO World Heritage Centre | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1310 | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 14 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early Portuguese settlements were [[São Filipe, Cape Verde|São Filipe]] on the island of [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]] (between 1470 and 1490),&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6104 Centre historique de São Filipe], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; [[Praia]] on Santiago (before 1516),&lt;ref name=gomes/&gt;{{rp|77}} [[Ribeira Grande, Cape Verde|Ribeira Grande]] on [[Santo Antão, Cape Verde|Santo Antão]] (mid 16th century)&lt;ref name=gomes/&gt;{{rp|82}} and [[Ribeira Brava, Cape Verde|Ribeira Brava]] on [[São Nicolau, Cape Verde|São Nicolau]] (1653).&lt;ref name=dgt&gt;[http://www.portaldoconhecimento.gov.cv/bitstream/10961/4125/1/IRTUR2_RBSN_Actual.pdf Inventário dos recursos turísticos do município de Ribeira Brava de São Nicolau], Direcção Geral do Turismo, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1492 the [[Spanish Inquisition]] emerged in its fullest expression of [[anti-Semitism]]. It spread to neighboring [[Portugal]] where [[John II of Portugal|King João II]] and especially [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] in 1496, decided to [[Persecution of Jews and Muslims by Manuel I of Portugal|exile thousands of Jews]] to [[São Tomé Island|São Tomé]], [[Príncipe]], and Cape Verde. They were allowed to engage in trade. Free-lance traders were referred to as ''[[lançados]]'', who were often, but not always, of Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20120825112555/http://www.saudades.org/jewscapev.html|archive-date=25 August 2012|url=http://www.saudades.org/jewscapev.html|title=Jews in Cape Verde and on the Guinea Coast|author=Richard Lobban|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 16th - 19th century ===

The richess of Ribeira Grande and conflicts between Portugal and rival colonial powers France and Britain attracted pirate attacks, including those by [[Francis Drake]] ([[Capture of Santiago (1585)|1585]]) and [[Jacques Cassard]] ([[Cassard expedition|1712]]).&lt;ref name=gomes/&gt;{{rp|195}} Despite the construction of [[Forte Real de São Filipe]] in 1587-93, Ribeira Grande remained vulnerable and went into decline. The capital was moved to [[Praia]] in 1770.&lt;ref name=unescopraia&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6103 Centre historique de Praia], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

The eruption of the volcano [[Pico do Fogo]] in 1680 covered much of the island of Fogo in ash, which forced many inhabitants to flee to the nearby island of [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]].&lt;ref name=jenkins&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://appliedvolc.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13617-017-0057-6|title=Damage from lava flows: insights from the 2014–2015 eruption of Fogo, Cape Verde|journal=Journal of Applied Volcanology Society and Volcanoes|date=20 March 2017|author=S. F. Jenkins et al.|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the end of the 18th century, [[whaling]] ships from [[North America]] started hunting whales around the Azores and the Cape Verde Islands. They used the harbours of Brava to stock up on supplies and drinking water. They hired men from Brava as sailors, and several of these settled around the Massachusetts whaling port of [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].&lt;ref name=gomes/&gt;{{rp|439-440}}

===20th century===

[[File:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1978, MiNr 2293.jpg|thumb|[[Amílcar Cabral]] on a stamp of [[East Germany]]]]
From the beginning of the 20th century the port of Mindelo lost its importance for transatlantic navigation. Causes for this were the shift from coal to oil as fuel for ships, the rise of competing ports like Dakar and the Canary Islands and the lack of investment in port infrastructure.&lt;ref name=delgado/&gt; Due to its generally dry climate, Cape Verde has been struck by a series of drought-related famines between the 1580s and the 1950s. Two of Cape Verde's [[Famine in Cape Verde|worst-ever famines]] occurred in 1941-43 and 1947-48, killing an estimated 45,000 people.&lt;ref name=brooks&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://hdl.handle.net/2022/3269 |title=Cabo Verde: Gulag of the South Atlantic: Racism, Fishing Prohibitions, and Famines| first= George E. |last=Brooks|journal= [[History in Africa]]|volume= 33| year= 2006|pages=101–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several thousands of islanders emigrated, for instance accepting contract labour on the cocoa plantations of Portuguese [[São Tomé and Príncipe]].&lt;ref name=keese&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/bitstream/handle/18452/14232/22gDqzLZTTGk.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Managing the Prospect of Famine.

In the lead-up to and during the [[Portuguese Colonial War]], those planning and fighting in the [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence|armed conflict]] in [[Portuguese Guinea]] often linked the goal of liberation of [[Guinea-Bissau]] to the goal of liberation in Cape Verde. For instance, in 1956, [[Amílcar Cabral|Amílcar]] and [[Luís Cabral]] founded the [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC). However, there was no armed conflict in Cape Verde, and ultimately independence for Cape Verde resulted from negotiation with Portugal after the April 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;António Costa Pinto, "The transition to democracy and Portugal's decolonization", in Stewart Lloyd-Jones and António Costa Pinto (eds., 2003). ''The Last Empire: Thirty Years of Portuguese Decolonization'' (Intellect Books, {{ISBN|978-1-84150-109-3}}) pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1974, an agreement was signed in [[Algiers]] between the Portuguese government and the PAIGC, recognising the independence of Guinea-Bissau and the right to independence of Cape Verde.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ci.uc.pt/cd25a/wikka.php?wakka=descon05 Acordo entre o governo Português e o Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde], Centro de Documentação 25 de Abril&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 July 1975, at Praia, Portugal's Prime Minister [[Vasco Goncalves]] turned over power to National Assembly President [[Abilio Duarte]], and Cape Verde became independent.

The '''Time from NPL''' is a radio signal broadcast from the [[Anthorn Radio Station]] near [[Anthorn]], [[Cumbria]], which serves as the United Kingdom's national time reference.&lt;ref name="nplmsf"&gt;{{cite web|title=NPL Time Metrology|publisher=National Physical Laboratory, UK | url=http://www.npl.co.uk/science-technology/time-frequency/products-and-services/time/msf-radio-time-signal|accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time signal is derived from three [[atomic clock]]s installed at the transmitter site, and is based on [[time standard]]s maintained by the UK's [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL) in [[Teddington]].&lt;ref name="leaflet"&gt;{{cite web|title=MSF The Time from NPL |publisher=National Physical Laboratory, UK |accessdate=6 April 2007 |url=http://www.clockco.co.uk/documents/msf.pdf |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031013926/http://www.clockco.co.uk/documents/msf.pdf |archivedate=October 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The service is provided by [[Babcock International Group|Babcock International]] (which acquired former providers [[VT Communications]]), under contract to the NPL.

The signal, also known as the '''MSF signal''' (and formerly the '''Rugby clock'''), is broadcast at a highly accurate frequency of 60&amp;nbsp;kHz and can be received throughout the UK, and in much of northern and western Europe.
The signal's [[carrier frequency]] is maintained at 60&amp;nbsp;kHz to within 2 parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, controlled by [[Atomic clock|caesium atomic clocks]] at the radio station.&lt;ref name="nplmsf" /&gt;

== History ==
A radio station at Rugby was first operated by the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|Post Office]] from 1926, with the call-sign GBR. From 19 December 1927, it broadcast a 15.8&amp;nbsp;kHz time signal from the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] which could be received worldwide. It consisted of 306 pulses in the five minutes up to and including 10:00 and 18:00 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]], with a longer pulse at the start of each minute. [[Frequency-shift keying]] was added in 1967, making the signal harder to use as a frequency reference. The time signals, preceded by the callsign "GBR GBR TIME" in [[Morse code]], were transmitted during the 5 minutes preceding 03:00, 09:00, 15:00 and 21:00. Transmitter GBZ on 19.6&amp;nbsp;kHz was used as a reserve, when GBR was off-air for maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Gerd Klawitter | title=List of Time Signal Stations (9th Edition) | year=1980 | pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, time signals from GBR were terminated in November 1986 and it is no longer used as a frequency reference.&lt;ref name="faqs" /&gt;

The MSF signals started in 1950, following the transmission pattern [[#Protocol|described below]]. They were originally intended to provide frequency references at 2.5, 5 and 10&amp;nbsp;MHz, originally only occasionally during the day. At first, there were announcements every fifteen minutes, beginning with the Morse code representation of "MSF MSF MSF" (MSF is "-- ··· ··-·" in Morse code), followed by speech "This is MSF, Rugby, England, transmitting ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NPL Time Reference FAQ|url=http://www.npl.co.uk/science-technology/time-frequency/time/faqs/what-does-msf-stand-for-(faq-time)|publisher=NPL|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From May 1953, the signal was broadcast 24 hours a day, but with regular five-minute stoppages to allow the reception of other signals. The 60&amp;nbsp;kHz signal finally became an uninterrupted 24-hour service in 1966, and the frequency references were discontinued in February 1988.&lt;ref name="faqs" /&gt;

On 27 February 2007 the NPL started tests of the new time signal transmissions from [[Anthorn Radio Station|Anthorn]]{{coord|54.91|N|3.28|W|region:GB|display=title}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==The 'MSF signal' and the 'Rugby clock'==

From the time signal's inauguration in 1950 until 1 April 2007 it was transmitted from [[Rugby Radio Station]] near [[Rugby, Warwickshire]].&lt;ref name="faqs"&gt;{{cite web|title=NPL T&amp;F: FAQs|publisher=National Physical Laboratory, UK | accessdate = 23 January 2008 | url=http://www.npl.co.uk/science-technology/time-frequency/time/faqs/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moved" /&gt; The transmitter's original location meant that the clock was referred to as "the Rugby clock".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ARM+FPGA based Rugby clock | publisher = Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge | accessdate = 6 April 2007 | url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2005/ECADArch/lab6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its relocation in 2007 to Cumbria, the NPL now formally calls the signal "The Time from NPL".&lt;ref name="moved" /&gt;

The Rugby transmitter's [[callsign]] was MSF, where 'M' is one of the [[ITU prefix]]es allocated to the United Kingdom, and the letters 'SF' were allocated for no documented reason. This resulted in the common terminology "the MSF signal", which is still used by the NPL.&lt;ref name="faqs" /&gt; The official history of the service says that "Rugby was given an additional commitment for the transmission of reference ''Modulated Standard Frequencies''", but no actual explanation is given for the call sign "MSF".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/sites/r/rugby_radio/indexr69.shtml The Official History of Rugby Radio Station]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NPL it seems the call sign was chosen so that it could be memorized as "Master Standard Frequency" but MSF was not intended to be an acronym.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npl.co.uk/science-technology/time-frequency/time/faqs/what-does-msf-stand-for-(faq-time) NPL FAQ "What does MSF stand for?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission and reception==
The transmitted signal has an [[effective radiated power]] of 17 [[kilowatt|kW]], on a frequency of 60 [[kilohertz|kHz]] to within 2 parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="nplmsf" /&gt; The signal strength is greater than 10 mV/m at 100&amp;nbsp;km; it is greater than 100 μV/m at 1,000&amp;nbsp;km from the transmitter, and thus can be received at not less than this strength throughout the UK.&lt;ref name="moved"&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Has Moved |publisher=National Physical Laboratory, UK |accessdate=6 April 2007 |url=http://www.npl.co.uk/time/msf/change.html |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004145/http://www.npl.co.uk/time/msf/change.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The signal can also be received, and is widely used, in northern and western Europe.&lt;ref name="nplmsf" /&gt;

While at Rugby, the transmitter generated 60&amp;nbsp;kW of [[radio frequency]] power (using 70&amp;nbsp;kW of [[Mains electricity|mains power]]). The 180m-high [[T-aerial]] antenna was 500m across at its top. The vertical part of the antenna radiated the signal, so that the received strength was similar in all directions (it was approximately [[Omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]]).&lt;ref name="faqs" /&gt;

==Uses==
In addition to professional uses where accurate time is required, [[radio-controlled clock]]s with both digital and analog displays using the NPL signal are widely used (similar clocks are available in other regions with standard time transmissions). As far as users are concerned they are simply clocks with the same features and settings as others, but always display the right time, and correct themselves for [[summer time]].

==Protocol==
===Fast code===
When MSF was first introduced, in 1950, it consisted only of seconds and minute markers, with no coded data. In 1974, a short burst of binary code at 100 bit/s, was inserted into the minute marker to specify the time. In 1977, a slow code was introduced, which encoded the time at 1 bit/s over the whole minute (as detailed below). In 1998, the original fast code was removed, leaving the slow code and a simple minute marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/faqs/what-is-the-msf-fast-code-(faq-time)|last=National Physical Laboratory|title=What is the MSF fast code? (FAQ-Time)|date=25 March 2010|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slow code===
Currently, the signal is encoded as follows:

The MSF transmitter is switched off for brief intervals ([[on-off keying]]) near the beginning of each second to encode the current time and date.  The rise and fall times of the 60&amp;nbsp;kHz carrier are determined by the combination of antenna and transmitter.&lt;ref name=NPLTFS&gt;{{cite web

Each UTC second begins with 100&amp;nbsp;ms of 'off', preceded by at least 500&amp;nbsp;ms of carrier.  The second marker is transmitted with an accuracy better than ±1 ms relative to [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), which is itself always within ±0.9 seconds of [[UT1|Universal Time]] (UT1) which is the mean solar time which would actually be observed at 0° longitude.

The first second of the minute, denoted second 00, begins with a period of 500 ms with the carrier off, to serve as a [[minute]] marker.

The other 59 (or, exceptionally, 60 or 58) [[second]]s of the minute always begin with at least 100 ms 'off', followed by two data bits of 100&amp;nbsp;ms each, and end with at least 700&amp;nbsp;ms of carrier.

* Bit A is transmitted from 100 to 200 ms after the second
* Bit B is transmitted from 200 to 300&amp;nbsp;ms after the second

Negative Polarity Bit Signalling
* &lt;code&gt;Carrier ON&lt;/code&gt; represents a bit value of 0.
* &lt;code&gt;Carrier OFF&lt;/code&gt; represents a bit value of 1.

If each second is considered as ten 100&amp;nbsp;ms pieces, the minute marker is transmitted as &lt;code&gt;1111100000&lt;/code&gt;, while all other seconds are transmitted as &lt;code&gt;1AB0000000&lt;/code&gt;.

Although two data bits are transmitted per second, the time code has the property that only one of them is variable; non-zero B bits are only transmitted when the corresponding A bit has a fixed value.

Seconds 01–16 carry information for the current minute about the difference (DUT1) between atomic and astronomical time, and the remaining seconds convey the time and date code.

The time and date code information begins 43 seconds ''before'' the corresponding minute marker (second 17 of the previous minute, in the absence of [[leap seconds]]), and is always given in terms of UK civil time, which is UTC in winter and UTC+1h when [[British Summer Time|Summer Time]] is in effect.

Consecutive bits from 01B–08B are set to 1 to indicate positive DUT1 values from +0.1s to +0.8s.  For example, bit 05B is set if DUT1 ≥ 0.5 s.  Consecutive bits from 09B–16B are set to 1 to indicate negative DUT1 values from −0.1s to −0.8s.  For example, bit 11B is set if DUT1 ≤ −0.3 s.

In case of a leap second, a zero bit is inserted between seconds 16 and 17.&lt;ref name=NPLTFS/&gt;  In case of a negative leap second, second 16 will be deleted.  Since negative leap seconds can only occur when DUT1 is positive, bits 9B through 16B will be zero.

Bits 17A–51A encode the time of the following minute in [[binary-coded decimal]], most significant bit first.  Beginning with bit 17A comes 4 bits of tens of years, 4 bits of years, 1 bit of tens of months, 4 bits of months, 2 bits of tens of days, 4 bits of days, 3 bits of day of week (0=Sunday), 2 bits of tens of hours, 4 bits of hours, 3 bits of tens of minutes, and 4 bits of minutes.

Bits 52A–59A provide another way to identify minute boundaries.  This sequence &lt;code&gt;01111110&lt;/code&gt; never appears elsewhere in the A bits; due to BCD encoding, at most five consecutive 1 bits can appear elsewhere in the A bits (bits 27A–31A, on July 30 or 31, or bits 33A–37A, if a day ending in 7 falls on a Saturday).  These six consecutive 1 bits thus uniquely identify the end of the minute.

Bits 54B–57B provide [[odd parity]] over the time code.  The 4 parity bits cover years (8 bits), months and days (11 bits), day of week (3 bits), and time of day (13 bits) respectively.

Bit 58B indicates the broadcast time is summer time.  Bit 53B gives warning that the summer time bit is about to change.  It is set for 61 consecutive minutes, starting 1 hour 7 seconds before the change, and ending 7 seconds before the change, 5 seconds before the first changed bit 58B, which is itself transmitted 2 seconds (1.7–1.8 seconds, to be more precise) before the moment of the time change.

=== Shortcomings of the current signal format ===
MSF does not broadcast any explicit advance warning of upcoming [[leap second]]s, which occur less than once a year on average.&lt;ref name="TROGER"/&gt;  The only indication is a change in the number of padding bits before the time code during the minute before the leap second.  Therefore, unless a leap-second announcement is manually entered into a receiver in advance, it may take some time until an autonomous MSF receiver regains synchronization with UTC after a leap second (especially if the reception is not robust at the time of the leap second).

The time signal only provides 1 hour warning of summer-time changes.&lt;ref name=NPLTFS/&gt;

== Outages ==
MSF normally broadcasts continuously, but is occasionally taken out of service for scheduled or unscheduled maintenance.  The NPL maintains a web page which lists upcoming scheduled outages and information on unscheduled maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npl.co.uk/science-technology/time-frequency/products-and-services/time/msf-outages MSF Outages]&lt;/ref&gt;

But the colonial government took the Fijians side. Land sales were forbidden, health campaigns implemented and the population picked up again. Theirs was not, of course, the culture of the heathen ‘golden age’, but one modified by the new religion and increasingly the new economic order. Yet in today’s Fiji, independent since 1970, a surprising amount has survived.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
