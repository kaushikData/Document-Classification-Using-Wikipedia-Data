      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1669">'''Asyik''' (literally "beloved"/"besotted") is a classical royal court dance popular in [[Patani (region)|Patani]] and [[Kelantan]]. According to [[Hikayat Patani]], the dance was created in 1644 to entertain the grieving [[Ratu Kuning]] over the loss of her favorite bird. The dance’s name "the beloved" could have been referring to the lost bird.&lt;ref name="reference 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dancemalaysia.com/Dance/Traditional/Court_Dance/Asyik/asyik.htm|title=Asyik|publisher=Dance Malaysia|accessdate=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reference 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomalaysia.net/dances/1553-tarian-asyik-the-dance-of-a-lover |title=Tarian Asyik (Dance of a Lover) |publisher=GoMalaysia.net |accessdate=2010-09-24 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance begins with ten beautifully costumed dancers entering the dancing hall and sitting gracefully. The prima donna, also known as ''Puteri Asyik'' ("the princess of love") will then appear and the dance begins with gracious and delicate body movements and gestures.&lt;ref name="reference 1" /&gt; 

The orchestra of the dance consists of eleven types of ''gedombak asyik'' (a small [[drum]]), ''gambang'' (a [[xylophone]]-like instrument, usually made of slabs of wood or bronze), and a ''rebab'' (a bowed [[lute]]).&lt;ref name="reference 2" /&gt;

Although it begins as a court dance, over time, the dance became popular among common people and used as folk entertainment during festivals and marriages.

'''''Beware! Children at Play''''' is a 1989 [[horror film]] directed by Mik Cribben and distributed by [[Troma Entertainment]].

==Plot==
The film follows the inhabitants of a small rural town whose children are disappearing at an alarming rate and whose adults are simultaneously being killed in a ritualistic fashion. It is revealed early on that the kids are being inducted into a [[Cannibalism in humans|cannibalistic]] cult that live in the woods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34286/uncle-bob-martin-suffer-little-children Uncle Bob Martin: Suffer the Little Children]&lt;/ref&gt; The cult is somehow inspired or influenced by the legendary tales from the [[Old English]] epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aintitcool.com/node/42594 Ain't it cool news: Horror Movie A Day: BEWARE! CHILDREN AT PLAY (1989)]&lt;/ref&gt; The title is known mostly because of its brutal depictions of violence against children (multiple [[child murder]]s).

==Cast==
* [[Michael Robertson (filmmaker)|Michael Robertson]] as John DeWolfe
* Rich Hamilton as Ross Carr
* Robin Lilly as Cleo Carr
* Lori Romero as Julia DeWolfe (credited as Lori Tilgrath)
* Jamie Krause as Kara DeWolfe

==Reception==
The film is one of Troma's most controversial titles due to its gruesome finale, a five-minute sequence where the townspeople brutally murder each of the cannibalistic children using firearms, pitchforks, and other assorted weapons. According to [[Lloyd Kaufman]], when the film's trailer played at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] before a screening of ''[[Tromeo and Juliet]]'', nearly half of the theatre walked out in protest.

[[Image:Fashion Plate Manteau 1823.jpg|thumb|right|Evening cloak or ''manteau'', from ''Costume Parisien'', 1823]]
[[Image:Cloak.jpg|thumb|Cloak, 1580-1600 [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] no. 793-1901]]

A '''cloak''' is a type of loose [[garment]] that is worn over indoor [[clothing]] and serves the same purpose as an [[overcoat]]; it protects the wearer from the cold, rain or wind for example, or it may form part of a fashionable outfit or [[uniform]]. Cloaks have been used by myriad historic societies; many climates favor wearing a full-body garment which is easily removed and does not constrain the wearer with sleeves. Over time cloak designs have been changed to match fashion and available [[textile]]s.

Cloaks generally fasten at the neck or over the shoulder, vary in length, from hip all the way down to the ankle, mid-calf being the normal length. They may have an attached [[hood (headgear)|hood]] and may cover and fasten down the front, in which case they have holes or slits for the hands to pass through. However, cloaks are almost always sleeveless.

==Etymology==
The word ''cloak'' comes from Old North French ''cloque'' ([[Old French]] ''cloche'', ''cloke'') meaning "travelling cloak", from [[Medieval Latin]] ''clocca'' "travelers' cape," literally "a bell," so called from the garment's bell-like shape. Thus the word is related to the word ''clock''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cloak|title=cloak - Origin and meaning of cloak by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ancient Greeks and Romans were known to wear cloaks. Greek men and women wore the ''[[himation]]'', from the Archaic through the Hellenistic periods (c. 750-30 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266091/himation|title=Himation - clothing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romans would later wear the Greek-styled cloak, the ''[[pallium (Roman cloak)|pallium]]''. The ''pallium'' was quadrangular, shaped like a square,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''De Pallio'', I&lt;/ref&gt; and sat on the shoulders, not unlike the ''himation''.

Romans of the Republic would wear the [[toga]] as a formal display of their citizenship. It was denied to foreigners&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Divus Claudius'', XV&lt;/ref&gt; and was worn by magistrates on all occasions as a badge of office. The toga was claimed to have originated with [[Numa Pompilius]], the second king of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], LLD |editor2=William Wayte |editor3=G. E. Marindin | encyclopedia = [[A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]] | title = Toga | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0063%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DT%3Aentry+group%3D2%3Aentry%3Dtoga-cn | accessdate =  | year = 1890 | publisher = John Murray | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opera cloak==
{{main|Opera cloak}}
In full [[formal wear|evening dress]] in the Western countries, [[lady|ladies]] and [[gentleman|gentlemen]] frequently use the cloak as a [[fashion statement]], or to protect the fine [[Textile|fabric]]s of evening wear from the elements, especially where a [[coat (clothing)|coat]] would crush or hide the garment. Opera cloaks are made of quality materials such as wool or cashmere, velvet and satin.

Ladies may wear a long (over the shoulders or to ankles) cloak usually called a [[cape]], or a full-length cloak. Gentlemen wear an ankle-length or full-length cloak.  Formal cloaks often have expensive, colored linings and trimmings such as [[silk]], [[satin]], [[velvet]] and [[fur]].

==In literature and the arts==
[[File:Couple cloak Louvre G99.jpg|thumb|Couple hiding under the same cloak, fragment of an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] cup, ca. 525 BC–500 BC, found in Athens. [[Louvre]] Museum, Paris.]]
According to the [[King James Version]] of the Bible, Matthew recorded Jesus of Galilee saying in Matthew 5:40: "And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also."  The King James Version of the Bible has the words recorded a little differently in Luke 6:29: "...and him that taketh away thy cloke, forbid not to take thy coat also."

Cloaks are a staple garment in the [[fantasy]] genre due to the popularity of [[medieval]] settings, although fantasy cloak designs normally have more resemblance to 18th or 19th-century cloaks rather than medieval ones.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} They are also usually associated with [[witch]]es, [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]s, and [[vampire]]s; the best-known stage version of ''[[Dracula (novel)|Dracula]],'' which first made actor [[Bela Lugosi]] prominent, featured him wearing it so that his exit through a trap door concealed on the stage could seem sudden. When Lugosi reprised his role as Dracula for the 1931 [[Universal Studios]] motion picture version of the play, he retained the cloak as part of his outfit, which made such a strong impression that cloaks came to be equated with [[Count Dracula]] in nearly all non-historical media depictions of him.

Fantasy cloaks are often [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]]. For example, they may grant the person wearing it [[invisibility]] as in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series by [[J. K. Rowling]]. A similar sort of garment is worn by the members of the Fellowship of the Ring in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], although instead of granting complete invisibility, the Elf-made cloaks simply appear to shift between any natural color (e.g. green, gray, brown) to help the wearer to blend in with his or her surroundings. Alternatively, they may nullify magical [[projectile]]s, as the "cloak of magic resistance" in [[NetHack]]. In addition, the magical [[Hide (skin)|hide]] [[armor]] that [[Hercules]] made for himself from the skin of the [[Nemean Lion]], at the end of Hercules' first labor, might also be seen as an early idea of a magical cloak. This latter was notable because it was said to be impervious to ''all'' cutting and impact weapons.

==Metaphor==
Figuratively, a cloak may be anything that disguises or conceals something. In many science fiction worlds such as ''[[Star Trek]]'', there are [[cloaking devices]], which provide a way to avoid detection or to make objects appear invisible.

Because they keep a person hidden and conceal a weapon, the phrase ''[[cloak and dagger]]'' has come to refer to [[espionage]] and [[secretive]] crimes: it suggests murder from hidden sources. "Cloak and dagger" stories are thus mystery, detective, and crime stories of this. The vigilante duo of Marvel comics [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] is a reference to this.

[[File:Desfile en El Alto, Bolivia.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Traditional [[folk dress]] during a festival in Bolivia.]]

'''[[Bolivia]]''' is a country in South America, bordered by [[Brazil]] to the north and east, [[Paraguay]] and [[Argentina]] to the south, [[Chile]] to the west, and [[Peru]] to the west. 

The cultural development of what is now Bolivia is divided into three distinct periods: pre-Columbian, colonial, and republican. Important archaeological ruins, gold and silver ornaments, stone monuments, [[Pottery|ceramics]], and weavings remain from several important pre-Columbian cultures. Major ruins include [[Tiwanaku]], [[Samaipata, Bolivia|Samaipata]], [[Inkallaqta]] and [[Iskanwaya]]. The country abounds in other sites that are difficult to reach and hardly explored by archaeologists.

The Spanish brought their own tradition of religious art which, in the hands of local indigenous and ''mestizo'' builders and artisans, developed into a rich and distinctive style of architecture, literature, and sculpture known as "Mestizo Baroque." The colonial period produced not only the paintings of Perez de Holguin, Flores, Bitti, and others, but also the works of skilled but unknown [[Stonemasonry|stonecutters]], woodcarvers, [[goldsmith]]s, and [[silversmith]]s. An important body of native baroque religious music of the colonial period was recovered in recent years and has been performed internationally to wide acclaim since 1994. Bolivian artists of stature in the 20th century include, among others, [[Guzman de Rojas]], [[Arturo Borda]], [[María Luisa Pacheco]], [[Master William Vega]], [[Alfredo Da Silva]], and [[Marina Núñez del Prado]].

==Festivals==
[[Paganism|Pagan]] rites from the pre-Columbian era are still common during the religious festivals of the Natives. The clothing used during the festivals is reminiscent of the dress of pre-Columbian Indians and 16th century [[Spaniards]]. The  at the annual [[Carnaval de Oruro|carnival of Oruro]] are among the great folkloric events of South America, as are the lesser known indigenous ''Anata Andina'' and the "carnival" at Tarabuco (''[[Pujllay]]''), or the ''[[Tinku]]'' - fertility rites held at Macha every 3 May.

==Dances==
[[File:Diablada oruro fraternidad.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Diablada of Oruro|Diablada]]'' dance primeval, typical and main of [[Carnival of Oruro]] a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] since 2001 in Bolivia (''Image: Fraternidad Artística y Cultural "La Diablada"'').]] 
Many dances and songs contain elements from both the native and European cultures. ''[[Caporales]]'' seems to be the most popular Bolivian dance of present times&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; in a few decades it has developed into an enormously popular dance, not only in the Highlands where it originated, but also in the Lowlands and in Bolivian communities outside the country. In the Highlands, other traditional and still very popular dances are: 
* ''[[Morenada]]''
* ''[[Kullawada]]''
* ''[[Diablada]]''
* ''Ch'utas''
* ''[[Waka waka (dance)|Waka Waka]]'' 
* ''[[Siklla]] (Wayra, Doctorcitos)''
*''Suri Sikuri''
* ''[[Tinku]]''
* ''[[Pukllay]]''
* ''[[Tobas (dance)|Tobas]]''
* ''[[Awki awki]]''
* ''[[Llamerada]]''
* ''Cambitas''
* [[Afro-Bolivian]] ''Saya''
* tango
In the Lowlands, there are:
* ''Macheteros''
* ''Taquirari''
* ''Chovena''

==Clothing==
[[File:Afrobolivianwoman.jpg|thumb|An [[Afro-Bolivian]] woman in [[Coroico]]]]
Clothing of Andean women of indigenous descent includes the [[pollera]] (pleated-skirt), the 19th century European [[bowler hat]], and a silky shawl known as a [[Manta (dress)|manta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forero|first=Juan|title=Women leave traditional Bolivian dress in closet|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/13/world/13iht-journal.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pollera was originally a simple Spanish dress that colonial authorities forced Spanish people to wear. The pollera is a symbol of pride for the [[Indigenous peoples in Bolivia|indigenous people]], who live in La Paz, and for people in rural areas.
 
The inhabitants of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, from babies to seniors, wear the same kind of clothes that are typical in western countries, like jeans, shorts (which are the most common because of the heat), t-shirts, dresses, etc.

==Sports==
{{See also|Football in Bolivia}}

[[Association football]] is the most popular sport in Bolivia. The governing body of football in Bolivia is the [[Federación Boliviana de Fútbol]] (FBF), which controls the national teams. The FBF organises the [[Bolivia national football team|men's]], [[Bolivia women's national football team|women's]], and [[Bolivia national futsal team|futsal]] national teams.

The [[Bolivia national football team]] is currently ranked 69th in the world, with their best [[FIFA ranking]] being 18th in the world. The national team has competed at the [[FIFA World Cup]] three times, the [[Copa América]] 23 times, and the [[Confederations Cup]] once.

La Paz has the highest tournament-class golf course in the world.

[[Bolivia's national basketball team]] finished 8th at the [[2016 South American Basketball Championship]]. There, Bolivia beat [[Ecuador national basketball team|Ecuador]] 75-74 for its first victory ever at the event. [[Bolivia's women's national basketball team]] won the silver medal at the 1978 [[South American Basketball Championship for Women]].

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Bolivian cuisine}}

Bolivian cuisine stems mainly from the combination of [[Spanish cuisine]] with traditional native Bolivian ingredients, with later influences from [[Germans]], [[Italians]], [[Basques]], [[Croats]], [[Russians]], and [[Poles]], due to the arrival of immigrants from those countries. The three traditional staples of Bolivian cuisine are [[corn]], [[potatoes]], and [[beans]]. These ingredients have been combined with a number of staples brought by the Europeans, such as [[rice]], [[wheat]], and meat, such as [[beef]], [[pork]], and [[chicken]].

==Music==
{{Main|Music of Bolivia}}
[[File:Niños ejecutando una tarkeada.jpg|thumb|Bolivian children playing the ''[[Tarka (flute)|tarka]]''.]]
Bolivia's regional [[folk music]] is distinctive and varied. In the Andean regions, music is played during the festivals and dances. Some tunes contain strong Spanish influences.

The most common musical instruments are:
* ''[[Siku (instrument)|Sicu]]'' (also ''sicus'')
* ''[[Tarka (flute)|Tarka]]'' or ''[[tharqa]]''
* ''[[Pinkillo]]''
* Skin drums
* Copper bells
* Wood
* [[Guitar]]
* [[Flute]]
* ''Zampoña''
* ''Matraca''

The '''Dallas Holocaust Museum/Center for Education &amp; Tolerance''' is a Holocaust museum located in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. In 1977, 125 Jewish [[Holocaust survivors]] and North Texas residents joined together and formed an organization called Holocaust Survivors in Dallas. In 1984, the survivors along with national and North Texas benefactors established The Dallas Memorial Center for Holocaust Studies. The museum was located at the Dallas Jewish Community Center in North Dallas. In January 2005, the Memorial Center changed its name to the Dallas Holocaust Museum/Center for Education &amp; Tolerance, and moved to its present, temporary location in downtown Dallas. Plans have been made for its permanent location in the historic West End area of downtown Dallas, Texas.

The museum houses an actual boxcar (from [[Belgium]]) used to transport [[Jews]] to [[ghettos]] and [[Nazi concentration camps]]. In addition to the museum collection, an entire room is designed as a memorial. Plaques on the walls list the names of lost relatives of Dallas survivors. The museum also features temporary exhibitions as well as tours led by Dallas Holocaust survivors.

== Prototypicality ==

Prototypicality is the degree to which an individual fits the [[prototype]] of a group they could be categorized within. Prototypicality relates to threat perception in that the more prototypical an individual looks, specifically focusing on blacks, the more others who associate blacks with they stereotype of dangerousness will perceive them as threatening. Prototypic black targets display physical traits stereotypically associated with Blacks (broad nose, large lips, coarse hair, darker skin tone).&lt;ref name="(Ma &amp; Correll)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ma|first1=Debbie|last2=Correll|first2=Joshua|title=Target prototypicality moderates racial bias in the decision to shoot|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=12 November 2010|volume=47|issue=2|pages=391–396|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2010.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prototypicality affected [[prejudice]]; it was shown to impact judgments about an individual's characteristics. For example, a study by Ma &amp; Corell (2011)&lt;ref name="(Ma &amp; Correll)" /&gt; showed that individuals are more biased and prejudiced against more prototypic black targets than less prototypic targets.

In daily life, individuals are more likely to encounter white people as the default race within the United States as opposed to Black individuals. When encountering atypical whites (white people with features associated with Blackness), individuals ultimately settle on a White response (the general response to typical white targets is to decide not to shoot quicker and more frequently than in trials with black targets), in contrast to encountering Blacks with atypical features where Black cues appear to be more dominant and elicit a Black (to decide to shoot quicker and more frequently than trials with white targets) due to a misplaced threat perception.&lt;ref name="(Freeman, Pauker, Apfelbaum, &amp; Ambady)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=Jonathan|last2=Pauker|first2=Kristin|last3=Apfelbaum|first3=Evan|last4=Ambady|first4=Nalini|title=Continuous dynamics in the real-time perception of race|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=12 October 2009|volume=46|pages=179–185|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2009.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lay people are more racially biased, on average, than trained individuals such as police officers. Prototypicality is shown to moderate racial bias which has been shown to be linked to a perceived threat as black people specifically are predisposed to being viewed as more threatening.&lt;ref name="(Correll, Urland, Ito)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Correll|first1=Joshua|last2=Urland|first2=Geoffrey|last3=Ito|first3=Tiffany|title=Event-related potentials and the decision to shoot: The role of threat perception and cognitive control|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=10 May 2005|volume=42|pages=120–128|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police officers show a reduced racial bias in comparison to members of the community; however, police officers were no better than community members in their sensitivity to prototypic targets providing evidence that prototypicality is directly linked to stereotypes and threat perception which ultimately perpetuates stereotype threat.&lt;ref name="(Ma &amp; Correll)" /&gt; Members of the same category (race) become harder to distinguish from other members of the same category the more they look like a prototypical representation of their category.&lt;ref name="(Young, Hugenberg, Bernstein, &amp; Sacco)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Steven|last2=Hugenberg|first2=Kurt|last3=Bernstein|first3=Michael|last4=Sacco|first4=Donald|title=Interracial contexts debilitate same-race face recognition|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=19 May 2009|volume=45|issue=5|pages=1123–1126|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2009.05.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Young, Hugenberg, Bernstein, Sacco 2009).

=== Racial ambiguity defies prototypicality ===

Racial ambiguity is linked to prototypicality in that racially ambiguous individuals walk a line of not always looking prototypical of either group they represent, but being a blend of the various groups. This can leave blurred lines in terms of threat perception in having difficulty categorizing a racially ambiguous individual and determining what perception is more accurate: a more threatening perception in line with black stereotypes or a less threatening perception akin to white stereotypes. (Young, Hugenberg, Bernstein, &amp; Sacco 2009). Racially ambiguous faces get more racial bias than white faces and less racial bias than black faces, acting as an intermediate, on average.&lt;ref name="(Ito, Willadsen-Jensen, Kaye, &amp; Park)" /&gt; There is evidence for the implicit associations of slight differences in facial features.&lt;ref name="(Ito, Willadsen-Jensen, Kaye, &amp; Park)" /&gt; The degree to which racially ambiguous faces appeared most in line with the prototypical representation of a race, either black or white, directly activated and impacted the evaluations of participants associated with the respective group.&lt;ref name="(Ito, Willadsen-Jensen, Kaye, &amp; Park)" /&gt; This then bolstered stereotypes and the predisposition of individuals to be judges and evaluated based on stereotypes. This also has potential to breed stereotype threat into a marginalized population. In a white-only context, racially ambiguous individuals are viewed as more prototypically Black, and thus more threatening, whereas in a Black-only context, racially ambiguous individuals are viewed as less prototypically black.&lt;ref name="(Ito, Willadsen-Jensen, Kaye, &amp; Park)" /&gt; Facial features matter when associating a racially ambiguous individual with an evaluative association of a respective group.&lt;ref name="(Ito, Willadsen-Jensen, Kaye, &amp; Park)" /&gt;

Perceptions of threat based on stereotypes associated with one’s physicality can certainly promote stereotype threat, as a person’s physicality that often associates them with a race-based stereotype is not easily changed. [[Hypodescent]] is a phenomenon that is present in a racially ambiguous individuals being categorized into the racial group associated with their more “socially-subordinate heritage.”&lt;ref name="(Ito, Willadsen-Jensen, Kaye, &amp; Park)" /&gt; This concept is a demonstration of a way in which the categorization of racially ambiguous individuals can influence the longevity of a stereotype by supporting a subordinate heritage of any individual based on race. However more difficult to categorize individuals who tend to look more similar to the prototypical representation of their dominant race (for example: 90-10 Black:White) than it is to distinguish a more racially ambiguous individual (60-40 Black:White) which is very ironic in that one might think the more prototypical you look, the easier it would be to assign you to a racial category to assess your perceived threat.&lt;ref name="(Young, Hugenberg, Bernstein, &amp; Sacco)" /&gt; Perceptions of racially ambiguous faces can be impacted by racial labeling and the context in which the faces are presented (white-only vs. black-only environment).&lt;ref name="(Ito, Willadsen-Jensen, Kaye, &amp; Park)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ito|first1=Tiffany|last2=Willadsen-Jensen|first2=Eve|last3=Kaye|first3=Jesse|last4=Park|first4=Bernadette|title=Contextual variation in automatic evaluative bias to racially-ambiguous faces|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=2 March 2011|volume=47|issue=4|pages=818–823|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.02.016|pmid=21691437|pmc=3117667}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Ito, Willadsen-Jensen, Kaye, &amp; Park 2011).

=== Categorization ===

Categorization of individuals as a tool for evaluating them reduces an individual to being associated with the streotypical representation of that group. Once stereotypical associations are made, this gives rise to individuals assessing the level of threat an individual exhibits if a threatening connotation is associated with the stereotype of that group.  Research suggests that things are identified by comparing its traits to an association of similar items/processes stored in their memory.&lt;ref name="(Jackson &amp; Dutton 1988)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Susan|last2=Dutton|first2=Jane|title=Discerning Threats and Opportunities|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|date=September 1988|volume=33|issue=3|pages=370–387|doi=10.2307/2392714}}&lt;/ref&gt; When categorizing and making connections of an individual to a stereotype equating their perception of threat to the degree to which that categorized individual aligns with the stereotype can lead to stereotype threat falling on the categorized person. Lasting effects of race category activation on judgment, evaluation, and behavior that can have serious outcomes, such as biases in criminal sentences. Individuals vary in the extent to which stereotypes are associated with social categories.&lt;ref name="(Allen, Sherman, Conrey, &amp; Stroessner)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Thomas|last2=Sherman|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Conrey|first3=Frederica|last4=Stroessner|first4=Steven|title=Stereotype strength and attentional bias: Preference for confirming versus disconfirming information depends on processing capacity|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=12 June 2009|volume=45|issue=5|pages=1081–1087|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2009.06.002|pmid=20161043|pmc=2753983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strength of stereotype association impacts stereotype effect.&lt;ref name="(Allen, Sherman, Conrey, &amp; Stroessner)" /&gt; Categorization was thought to be inevitable, a result of the perception of others...however it is avoidable and its avoidance can hopefully reduce prejudice, reduce unjust threat perceptions, and counteract stereotype threat.&lt;ref name="(Freeman, Pauker, Apfelbaum, &amp; Ambady)" /&gt;

== Stereotypes ==
A stereotype can be defined as the association of a group with a trait (ex: Blacks being linked to dangerousness or criminality).&lt;ref name="(Greenwald, Oakes, &amp; Hoffman)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenwald |first1=Anthony G. |last2=Oakes |first2=Mark A. |last3=Hoffman |first3=Hunter G. |date=22 October 2002 |title=Targets of discrimination: Effects of race on responses to weapons holders |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=399–405 |doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(03)00020-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States individuals are more likely to encounter white people as the default race as opposed to Black individuals.&lt;ref name="(Freeman, Pauker, Apfelbaum, &amp; Ambady)" /&gt; In a White majority, perceptual systems may be more sensitive to, and also more biased toward Black features which can automatically activate stereotypes that link to threat perception.&lt;ref name="(Freeman, Pauker, Apfelbaum, &amp; Ambady)" /&gt; Event Related Potentials (ERPs) demonstrate attention is preferentially directed toward Black targets showing that there is a tendency to attend to potential threats, which black individuals have been stereotypically associated with.&lt;ref name="(Freeman, Pauker, Apfelbaum, &amp; Ambady)" /&gt; Descriptions of stereotypical Black behavior are more likely to be attributed to photographs of individuals who appear to be more Afrocentric.&lt;ref name="(Ma &amp; Correll)" /&gt;

The Quadruple Process Model involves a stimulus (ex: Black male) activating an association (ex: threat) in which the strength of the association (stereotype) prompts a behavior (ex: shoot response).&lt;ref name="(Correll, Urland, Ito)" /&gt; To survive, evolutionarily, humans must be to reliably identify threats.&lt;ref name="(Correll, Urland, Ito)" /&gt; The stimulus, association, stereotype, behavior system prompts the identification of a threat and initiates a response to the stimulus. Threat relevant associates are emotionally saturate and essential for survival.&lt;ref name="(Donders, Corell, Wittenbrink)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Donders|first1=Nicole|last2=Correll|first2=Joshua|last3=Wittenbrink|first3=Bernd|title=Danger stereotypes predict racially biased attentional allocation|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=22 April 2008|volume=44|issue=5|pages=1328–1333|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only can threat perception be influenced by emotionally salient factors, cultural stereotypes, and their strength combine to disadvantage blacks to be perceived as more threatening.&lt;ref name="(Correll, Urland, Ito)" /&gt; Recent stereotypes suggest that Blacks, even when unarmed, may be perceived as threatening.&lt;ref name="(Correll, Urland, Ito)" /&gt; Shooter bias is a tendency to shoot armed Blacks quicker and more frequently than armed Whites, but deciding not to shoot unarmed Whites quicker and more frequently than unarmed Blacks.&lt;ref name="(Correll, Urland, Ito)" /&gt; Individuals with greater knowledge of this cultural stereotype or a predisposition to link Blacks to violence displayed more extreme shooter bias and especially biased threat perceptions that led to especially biased behavior.&lt;ref name="(Correll, Urland, Ito)" /&gt;

There are two race effects that lead to Blacks being incorrectly shot at more than Whites:&lt;ref name="(Greenwald, Oakes, &amp; Hoffman)" /&gt;
:Perceptual sensitivity: guns are less distinguishable when held by Blacks
:Response bias: objects held by Blacks are more likely to be treated as guns. 
After being tasked to shoot individuals who held guns, and not to shoot if they were carrying any other object, race should technically be irrelevant to the decision to shoot or not shoot because the correct response solely depends on the object being held.&lt;ref name="(Correll, Urland, Ito)" /&gt; Even as a nondiagnostic component to the evaluation of one’s perceived threat value race was still factored in to the overall judgment of threat perception. The only information the participants were obligated to attend to was the identification of a weapon or non-weapon.&lt;ref name="(Greenwald, Oakes, &amp; Hoffman)" /&gt; Racial cues promote biased behavior as well as false threat perception. Any cue that implies danger, not just race, may create a predisposition to shoot, however race and the stereotype associated with it lead to a higher evaluation of threat perception, which impacted biased responses.&lt;ref name="(Correll, Urland, Ito)" /&gt;

Stereotypes have the potential to create associations with positive or negative aspects of the group it is generalizing. Research shows there is general negativity/prejudice toward Blacks leading highly prejudice individuals to link Blacks to negativity that is or is not relevant to the Black stereotype (ex: linking Blacks to words like poison or cancer).&lt;ref name="(Donders, Corell, Wittenbrink)" /&gt; Black danger association and stereotypes predict that Black faces capture and hold attention faster and longer than white faces because threatening stimuli captures and holds attention faster and for longer intervals than neutral stimuli (in this case black faces).&lt;ref name="(Donders, Corell, Wittenbrink)" /&gt; The perception of the level of threat posed by a black face significantly biases attention allocation due to an unjust stereotype leading to inaccurate threat perceptions. This also suggests that as fear conditioned stimuli, individuals are taught to have a pre-established instinct to associate the threat perception of a black individual as more dangerous. Attention has been shown to be biased as a result of societal stereotypes of Blacks in association with danger stereotypes of Blacks in association with danger that leads Black faces to b seen as fear conditioned stimuli.&lt;ref name="(Donders, Corell, Wittenbrink)" /&gt; Stereotypes can be gate keepers, they can be self-perpetuating by directing attention towards expected information or as an efficient information processing device that directs attention towards new information that may potentially undermine the stereotype and is dependent upon the individuals use of the stereotype.&lt;ref name="(Allen, Sherman, Conrey, &amp; Stroessner)" /&gt; The individual use of the stereotype is also what unfairly moderates the perceived threat of blacks by way of conditioning longstanding stereotypes.

== Neuronal activity ==
With the increasing strength of a stereotype, cognitively the associations we have attached to that stereotype, such as a higher rated threat perception of blacks, will be analyzed with more ease.&lt;ref name="(Allen, Sherman, Conrey, &amp; Stroessner)" /&gt; Because people are motivated to use as little cognitive resources as possible stereotypes and the connotations attached to them, such as threat perceptions of blacks, last as the most readily available and most easily comprehensible explanation.&lt;ref name="(Allen, Sherman, Conrey, &amp; Stroessner)" /&gt; In a White majority, the perceptual system may be more sensitive to Black faces, and more biased as well.&lt;ref name="(Young, Hugenberg, Bernstein, &amp; Sacco)" /&gt; ERPs demonstrate that attention is preferentially directed toward black targets.&lt;ref name="(Young, Hugenberg, Bernstein, &amp; Sacco)" /&gt; Participants were more biased/prejudice against prototypic Black targets that less prototypic black targets shown through fMRI and being presented with more or less prototypic individuals.&lt;ref name="(Correll, Urland, Ito)" /&gt; Non-prototypic individuals (ex: dark skinned white males) caused greater amygdala activation (akin to fear response) than did light skinned white males.&lt;ref name="(Correll, Urland, Ito)" /&gt; The [[amygdala]] is associated with fear, threat and emotion processing.&lt;ref name="(Correll, Urland, Ito)" /&gt;

Stereotypes and other expectations act as filters that increase the ease with which expectancy-consistent information can be processed.&lt;ref name="(Allen, Sherman, Conrey, &amp; Stroessner)" /&gt; People are motivated to use as little cognitive resources as possible giving the most attention to the easiest comprehensible material (expectancy-consistent information).&lt;ref name="(Allen, Sherman, Conrey, &amp; Stroessner)" /&gt; As stereotype strength increases, so should the ease of processing stereotype-consistent information.&lt;ref name="(Allen, Sherman, Conrey, &amp; Stroessner)" /&gt; Attention will shift from stereotype-consistent information to stereotype-inconsistent information.&lt;ref name="(Allen, Sherman, Conrey, &amp; Stroessner)" /&gt; Unexpected information is processed more extensively because it is more difficult to comprehend while consistent information can be coded as generic examples of the expectancy but inconsistent information must be uniquely coded as new information that is not aligned with expectancy.&lt;ref name="(Allen, Sherman, Conrey, &amp; Stroessner)" /&gt;

== Environment/context ==
The environment or context through which information is received impacts the threat associated with it. For example, if a man is wearing a [[hoodie]] and walking rather fast towards you in the morning, in a rich neighborhood, on a crowded street, while it is raining, threat perception is lower than encountering that same individual after dark, in a poverty stricken neighborhood with no rain on an empty street. Although this could have no threatening intentions at all, the context in which you encounter that person will dictate the level of threat associated with them.

[[Signal detection theory]] (SDT) involves a bias and reduces ability to distinguish tools from weapons after a Black prime even in situations when race was incidental (nondiagnostic).

The bias toward threat perception evaluation of black people, caused by stereotypes, can be lessened with access to diagnostic cues (ex: presence or absence of a weapon) and motivation.&lt;ref name="(Correll, Urland, Ito)" /&gt; Lay people are more racially biased, on average, than trained police officers.&lt;ref name="(Ma &amp; Correll)" /&gt; Target prototypicality is shown to moderate racial bias.&lt;ref name="(Ma &amp; Correll)" /&gt; Police officers show a reduced racial bias in comparison to members of the community, however police officers were no better than community members in their sensitivity to prototypic targets.&lt;ref name="(Ma &amp; Correll)" /&gt; Exposing people to stimuli where race is unrelated to the stereotype may eliminate racial bias.&lt;ref name="(Plant, Peruche, &amp; Butz)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plant|first1=Ashby|last2=Peruche|first2=Michelle|last3=Butz|first3=David|title=Eliminating automatic racial bias: Making race non-diagnostic for responses to criminal suspects|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=23 August 2004|volume=41|issue=2|pages=141–156|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2004.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial responses were racially biased but research shows that extensive practice with race being unrelated to the task at hand worked to eliminate racial bias.&lt;ref name="(Plant, Peruche, &amp; Butz)" /&gt;  As counter-stereotypical information is aggregated form multiple sources, it may force a change in the stereotype decreasing its strength or negating it entirely.&lt;ref name="(Allen, Sherman, Conrey, &amp; Stroessner)" /&gt; Exposure to counter stereotypic stimuli can reduce racial bias, making race non-diagnostic and unhelpful for the decision process; the characteristic (violence) is unrelated to the group (race).

==Usage==
The principle can directly affect hiring and retention decisions.  In the world of [[television news]], there is a bias to hire those who have shared values and biases with the organization.{{sfn|Bivens|2014||page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jTTJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143 143]}}{{sfn|Buerk|2005|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_igfFVfpELkC&amp;pg=PA96 96]}}  Likewise, [[executive producer]]s of news shows tend to hire staff that share their ideology and viewpoint, to the extent that FIFO is ruthlessly applied.{{sfn|Bivens|2014||page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jTTJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143 143]}}

Writer Kevin Duncan, in his book titled ''The Business Bullshit Book: The world’s most comprehensive dictionary'', suggests it is a "no-holds barred", "frank" and open assessment by a supervisor, who maps the employee's chances and alternate career paths boldly, forthrightly and unhesitatingly.  This is said to be "not necessarily" to the employee's advantage.{{sfn|Duncan|2017|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=UAtLDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT10 10]}}

Fitting in is not “a one way ticket.”  ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper quoted an anonymous source, who was employed by a United Kingdom housing association, said that FIFO is a rule of organizational life.  It is an organizational paradigm whereby the members of the team adopt ‘[[Camouflage|protective coloration]]’ and undergo a change in their behavior and beliefs.  It is a strong deterrent to [[whistle blowing]], for example.&lt;ref name="Ash"&gt;[[The Guardian]] (2015) quoted in {{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Te8ZDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62 |title=Whistleblowing and Ethics in Health and Social Care |first1=Angie |last1=Ash |pages=62–63 |location=City |publisher=Jessica Kingsley |isbn=9781784501082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate implementation of a FIFO policy was said to be coincidental, if not causally-related, to a toxic [[Tit for tat|tit-for-tat]] relationship with a union.&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://thetyee.ca/News/2005/08/08/TelusIdol/ |title=The Video that Outrages Telus Employees |quote=Lewd 'team building' party, caught on tape, further soured relations inside phone firm. |first1=Tom |last1=Barrett |newspaper=[[The Tyee]] |date=August 8, 2005 |accessdate=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[The Tyee]] opines:&lt;blockquote&gt;"One of the few things that the union and management agree on is that there is a new culture at [[Telus]]. Management describes it as the culture of a competitive meritocracy. Some people in the union at Telus call it the 'FIFO war.'&lt;br&gt;
"The term comes from Telus CEO Darren Entwistle, the Montreal-born executive who came to Telus five years ago from a telecommunications company in the U.K. In a profile of Entwistle that ran in [[BC Business|''B.C. Business'']] magazine in May, Lori Bamber wrote this about FIFO:&lt;br&gt;
"'In accounting it stands for ‘first in, first out’; at Telus, after Entwistle's arrival, it stood for ‘fit in or fuck off.’ It wasn't something that endeared him to people who heard about it. ‘You could get away with more in Europe,’ he says when asked about this controversial human resources philosophy. ‘People expect you to tell it like it is there.’”&lt;ref name="Barrett"/&gt;{{efn-ua|It is related to the "[[LIFO (education)|last hired, first fired]]" concept. FIFO more commonly stands for ''[[FIFO and LIFO accounting|first in first out]]'' or ''[[fly-in fly-out]]''.  It should not be conflated with another human resources concept that uses the same "[[FIFO (disambiguation)|FIFO]]" acronym {{ndash}} '''Fly-in fly-out''' is a method of employing people in remote areas by flying them temporarily to the work site instead of relocating employees and their families permanently.{{efn-ua|This is common in large mining regions in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/124186/20110318/rio-tinto-flies-former-gunns-workers-to-its-pilbara-mine-sites.htm |title=Rio Tinto flies former Gunns workers to its Pilbara mine sites |newspaper=[[International Business Times]] |date=17 March 2011 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada.}}  So the casual observer may confuse it with that meaning.&lt;ref name="Barrett"/&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the United Kingdom there were government proposals to statutorily extend [[Employment-at-will]] and permit employers to have immunity for "Fit in or fuck off" (not in those words) discussions with employees.  Such proposals have met with vocal opposition by organized labor, specifically [[Unite the Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Burke |first1=Tony |publisher=Tony Burke |date=November 25, 2011 |url=http://www.powerinaunion.co.uk/vince-cables-employment-rights-changes-fit-in-or-fk-off/|title=Vince Cable’s employment rights changes – “fit in or f**k off” |accessdate=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drift==
The [[acronym]] "FIFO", the [[neologism]], the phrase and [[meme]] "fit in or fuck off", and the concept have been expanded and exported to other contexts.   For example it is used as a justification for [[racism]], [[nationalism]] (''e.g.'', [[jingoism]]), [[ethnic]], nativist, immigrant restriction and [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] reaction, regulation and action.{{sfn|Sarra|2013|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_2lQxehv4PoC&amp;pg=PT279 279]}}&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://sabotagetimes.com/life/an-englishman-abroad?_escaped_fragment_= |title=An Englishman In Scotland The English and the Scots have always had a bit of a turbulent relationship but ''Sabotage Times'' discovers that what was once refered [sic] to as "friendly banter" has now boiled over into full blown racism. |first1=Trevor |last1=Ward |date=March 26, 2013 |newspaper=[[Sabotage Times]] |accessdate=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Giggs|2015|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MmrUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT112 112]}}&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theresaewells.com/2016/07/28/why-people-who-dont-fit-in-should-never-fuck-off/ |first1=Theresa E. |last1=Wells |date=July 28, 2016 |title=Why People Who Don’t Fit In Should Never Fuck Off |accessdate=October 12, 2017}}{{rs|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a direction in the United States to assimilate and be productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.breachbangclear.com/immigrants-fit-in-or-fuck-off/ |publisher=Small American Business |title= Immigrants – Fit In or Fuck Off |date= January 15, 2016 |accessdate= November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexism|Sexist reactions]] and [[stereotypes]] are also justified under the rubric.{{sfn|Holman|2017|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rPxrDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT123 123-124]}}  Thus, female guests on [[podcast]]s of ''[[This American Life]]'' have been often criticized for 'non-[[Alpha (ethology)|Alpha]]' speech patterns, even though prominent males (''e.g.'', [[Noam Chomsky]]) have exhibited similar traits.{{sfn|Holman|2017|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rPxrDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT123 123-124]}}  Some have advised these women to "FIFO".{{sfn|Holman|2017|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rPxrDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT123 123-124]}}  

It has become a contentious anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant slogan in Canada.{{efn-ua|"'Fit in or fuck off' is a miss-led and uneducated slogan ordering anyone not subscribing to the white man’s world to find the nearest exit.

'''Frans Peter von Knorring''', (6 October 1792, [[Kokemäki]] - 29 March 1875) was a social reformer on the [[Åland Islands]]. 

==Biography==
He was born on 6 October 1792. He was the [[vicar]] of [[Finström]] from 1834 to 1875 and he organized the [[educational system]] in Åland.  He started an elementary school at [[Godby]] in 1853. The school's syllabus included subjects related to farming.  A versatile man who published books on many subjects, such as [[linguistics]], [[geography]], [[pedagogy]] and [[economics]], he also founded the first [[newspaper]] on Åland in 1868. He died on 29 March 1875.

==Legacy==
Two statues have been raised in his honour, one in [[Mariehamn]] and one at the [[Church (building)|church]] of Finström.

'''''Fratricide Punished''''', or ''The Tragedy of Fratricide Punished: or Prince Hamlet of Denmark'', is the English name of a German-language [[Play (theatre)|play]] of anonymous origins and disputed age. Due to similarities of plot and [[Dramatis personæ|dramatis personae]], it is considered to be a German variant of the English play ''[[Hamlet]]'', though possibly not [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare’s]] ''Hamlet'', and is a problematic figure in discussions of [[Hamlet Q1]] and the so-called [[Ur-Hamlet]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hamlets: Cues, Qs, and remembered texts.|last=Menzer|first=Paul|publisher=University of Delaware Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=130–132|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such discussions have helped to raise interest in the text, which primarily lived in obscurity before the discovery of Q1 in 1823.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; ''Fratricide Punished'' was first published in German from a written manuscript in 1781 and translated to English by Georgina Archer in 1865.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title="If I could see the Puppets Dallying": Der Bestrafte Brudermord and Hamlet’s Encounters with Puppets.|journal=Shakespeare Bulletin|volume=31|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198708735.001.0001/acref-9780198708735-e-304|title=Der Bestrafte Brudermord|last=Dobson|first=Michael|date=2015|website=Oxford Reference|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hamlet after Q1: an uncanny history of the Shakespearean text|last=Lesser|first=Zachary|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2015|isbn=9780812223569|location=Philadelphia|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare in Germany in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries|last=Cohn|first=Albert|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1865|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the play is readily available online both in English and in German, the manuscript has been lost since its initial publication, and all subsequent editions of the text are, as such, at a remove from the original.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ''Fratricide Punished'' is often referred to by its &lt;nowiki/&gt;German title ''Der Bestrafte Brudermord,'' or ''Tragoedia der bestrafte Bruder-mord oder: Prinz Hamlet aus Dännemark.''

=== Plot ===
''Fratricide Punished'' is a play of five acts, each containing a minimum of six and as many as eleven scenes. While this may suggest a longer play, some scenes are quite scant. For instance, act three, scene seven contains just two sentences of dialogue from a single character. The play as published by ''[[Internet Shakespeare Editions]]'' runs approximately 545 lines. It contains minimal stage direction, restricting itself to character entrances, musical descriptions, and descriptors of physical action.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/doc/Brudermord_M/complete/|title=Der Bestrafte Brudermord|last=|first=|date=|website=Internet Shakespeare Editions|publisher=University of Victoria|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot runs largely along the lines of the familiar Shakespearean ''Hamlet,'' but it differs on occasion both in its events and the order of those events, and is notable for its elements of comedic farce, which have been emphasized in various productions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The play begins with an [[Induction (play)|induction]], wherein Night, personified as a wicked, [[trickster]]-like figure, calls forth three "furies", Alecto, Mägera, and Thisiphone, to assist her. She informs them that the new King of the land yearns for his sister-in-law and has murdered his brother—the previous king—so that he might have her. Night wishes to cloud both their judgements to aid in their incestuous relationship but also to sow discord and jealousy into their marriage. She also intends to raise up a desire for revenge in those loyal to the slain king. Alecto, Mägera, and Thisiphone agree to assist her. The play ends with an admonishment to those who would seek power through foul play to reconsider, as they will likely be repaid by similar means.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The remainder of ''Fratricide Punished'' seems at once familiar to readers of ''Hamlet'', yet at times strange.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; There are some important differences in the naming of characters. Perhaps the most noteworthy of these is Corambus, a name familiar in Q1 ''Hamlet'' but changed to Polonius in Q2 and the folio editions of Shakespeare's text. Corambus' son, Leonhard, is similarly named Laertes in those texts. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are noticeably absent, their roles replaced in part by unnamed Ruffians. The text also creates the character of Phantasmo to undertake a variety of roles, often comically.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Other notable differences include the lack of Hamlet's "to be or not to be" soliloquy, among others, and Ophelia's decision to commit suicide by jumping down a hill. One of the more "slapstick" differences comes when the Prince has been sent to England, accompanied by his would-be assassins. He foils their attempt on his life by having them stand on either side of him. At the moment the assassins shoot, Hamlet falls to the ground with the result that they shoot one another instead of him.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First Quarto of Hamlet|last=Irace|first=Kathleen|publisher=Cambridge UP|year=1999|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=20|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarities and differences between ''Fratricide Punished'', Q1 ''Hamlet'', and the second quarto and folio editions of ''Hamlet'' are a powerful point of discussion in academic discussions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== History ==
Surprisingly little is known about the history of ''Fratricide Punished'' prior to its publication, and there is little academic consensus about its early origins.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bad Quarto of Hamlet: A Critical Study|last=Duthie|first=George|publisher=Folcroft Press|year=1941|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German editor H.A.O. Reichard, who first published excerpts from the manuscript in his ''Theater-Kalender auf das Jahr 1779'' and went on to publish the work in its entirety in 1781 in his journal ''Olla Potrida,'' confirms only that the original bore the text "Pretz, den 27. Oktober 1710" (Pretz, October 27, 1710).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New Variorum Edition of Shakespeare|last=Shakespeare|first=William|publisher=J.B. Lippincott &amp; Co|year=1877|isbn=|editor-last=Furness|editor-first=Horace|location=Philadelphia|pages=114–142|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Nino Amico, referencing work by University of Catania professor Ingrid Hiller, claimed that the manuscript of ''Fratricide Punished'' was of a small format and some thirteen pages. Hiller's research, however, appears not to have been published and others have been unable to corroborate this elsewhere, such that even these scant details remain unconfirmable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barasch|first=Francis|year=2004|title=Shakespeare and the Puppet Sphere|url=|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume=34|issue=2|pages=157–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1981|title=Shakespeare coi Pupi|journal=Quaderni di Teatro|volume=13|pages=96–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the date of October 27, 1710 clearly places the manuscript in time, if not necessarily the time it was written, the location of Pretz remains disputed. It is known from the original publication by Reichard that he obtained the manuscript of ''Fratricide Punished'' from [[Konrad Ekhof]], a theater manager and historian, who had recently died.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ekhof's father-in-law had started a theater company in the town of [[Preetz]], a location in [[Plön]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Germany, in 1710. This has led Oxford professor Tiffany Stern to assert that the "Pretz" annotation on the manuscript most likely refers to Preetz, intuiting that Ekhof must have received the text from his father-in-law.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Amico, however, places the text at [[Preetz Priory|Kloster Preetz]], a nunnery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gersdorff|first=Wolfgang|year=1912|title=Vom Ursprung des Deutschen 'Hamlet.'|url=|journal=Jahrbuch der Deutschen Shakespeare-Gesellschaft|volume=|pages=48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others have argued that "Pretz" refers to either the towns of [[Graz|Graz, Austria]] or [[Pretzsch, Burgenlandkreis|Pretzsch]], Germany.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whatever answers the manuscript might have provided to these questions were lost when the manuscript itself was lost, at least as early as 1888.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Die Schauspiele der Englischen Komödianten|last=Creizenach|first=Wilhelm|publisher=|year=1889|isbn=|location=Berlin and Stuttgart|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the date of its writing, many scholars believe ''Fratricide Punished'' to be a manuscript developed over years of English performances in Germany beginning as early as 1586.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Kareen Klein, building off a sizable scholarly tradition, traces the lineage from the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, where troupes of English comedians, forced abroad by closed theaters at home, began touring continental Europe.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Kareen|year=2008|title=Paris, Romio and Julieta: Seventeenth-Century German Schakespeare|url=|journal=Shakespeare and His Collaborators over the Centuries|volume=|pages=85–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; They brought with them an expanded understanding of acting that included such fields as pantomime, dance, and clowning. Such physical skills were uncommon for continental actors of the time and would be necessary for performers looking to convey the meaning of their English-language scripts to audiences who spoke only German. That language barrier would, in time, cause the scripts of staples such as ''Romeo and Juliet'' and ''Titus Andronicus'', and perhaps ''Hamlet'', to be modified into simpler, more physical forms. Over time, as English troupes came to augment their numbers with German actors, their scripts would be translated into German editions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Translation into English ===
Reflecting the importance of Q1 Hamlet on the perceived relevance of ''Fratricide Punished,'' the text was first translated into English by Georgina Archer, not for the sake of the play itself but rather for Albert Cohn's 1865 book ''Shakespeare in Germany.'' R.G. Latham provided another translation in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Two Dissertations on the Hamlet of Saxo Grammaticus and of Shakespear|last=Latham|first=R.G.|publisher=Williams and Norgate|year=1872|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming that Archer's translation attempted to too heavily mimic the style of Shakespeare, and citing minor differences with Latham, Furness supplied a new translation in his 1877 ''Variorum'' collection. More recently, Christine Schmidle produced a translation for her 2010 theatrical production of the play, an experience that led her to believe that much of the comical effect of the work was a result of language barriers and adaptation experienced and undertaken by English actors performing in German-speaking lands.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidle|first=Christine|year=2013|title=Bilingual Hamlet: Der Bestrafte Brudermord in the 21st Century|url=|journal=Shakespeare Bulletin|volume=31|pages=191–212|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship to Hamlet ===
{{further|Ur-Hamlet|Hamlet Q1|Hamlet}}

While scholars generally agree that ''Fratricide Punished'' is a [[memorial reconstruction]] descended from some form of ''Hamlet'', it remains uncertain from which ''Hamlet'' it comes.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The differences and similarities between ''Fratricide Punished'' and the three major forms of ''Hamlet'' were examined line-by-line by George Duthie in his 1941 criticism of the so-called "bad quarto" of Q1, and the ''Variorum'' of Furness published the texts side-by-side as well.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Their analyses found a play that contained elements both of Q1 ''Hamlet'', published in 1603 but unknown until 1823, and the more familiar versions of the second quarto (1604) and folio (1623), as well as elements uniquely its own.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; This is a remarkably problematic finding for Shakespeare scholars, complicating an area already made difficult by the discovery of Q1.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Indeed, the majority of what has been written about ''Fratricide Punished'' exists strictly to better understand its relation to Q1 ''Hamlet'', such that it becomes troublesome to discuss one without the other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Yet, as it contains elements of all three versions, it seems clear that ''Fratricide Punished'' must have been reconstructed by an actor with knowledge of more than one version of ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Kathleen Irace, in presenting this, argues that the use of the name Corambus instead of Polonius firmly ties ''Fratricide Punished'' to Q1, as does the "increased villainy" of the King, who alone is responsible for devising the poisoning plot.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Yet, some elements exclusive to Q2 and F1 are found in the text as well. Irace points out that the first portion of the King's speech in Act I, Scene II is missing from Q1 ''Hamlet'' but oddly present in ''Fratricide Punished.''&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Meanwhile, elements exclusive to the text or shared only with Q1 would seem to some scholars to link ''Fratricide Punished'' to the ''Ur-Hamlet,'' a kind of primordial source text which some scholars have suggested was used by Shakespeare in creating his ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The existence of the ''Ur-Hamlet'' is debated in itself. Lastly, Duthie argues that the long gap between the assumed time of the text's creation and its discovery is wholly unaccounted for, leaving room for any number of changes.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Zachary Lesser, discussing the impact of Q1 ''Hamlet'' on the popular reception of Q2 and F1, demonstrates the way that both Q1 and ''Fratricide Punished'' have been used to support arguments from multiple camps across decades of time, a testament to the ongoing significance of the work.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Production History ==
Though it may have been born from production, few productions of ''Fratricide Punished'' have been undertaken since its discovery. In 1924, [[William Poel]], a British actor and theater manager who had staged a production of Q1 Hamlet in 1881, mounted a production of the play in [[Oxford|Oxford, England]] at the [[Oxford Music Hall|New Oxford Theatre]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare on the German Stage|last=Williams|first=Simon|publisher=Cambridge UP|year=2004|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.lib.ku.edu/spencer/tag/theater/|title=Kenneth Spencer Research Library|last=|first=|date=6 June 2014|website=The University of Kansas|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Prompt book|promptbook]], later published, contends that the audience met the characters with a derision and laughter far removed from the typical experience of ''Hamlet'' audiences.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=William Poel's Promptbook of Fratricide Punished|last=Poel|first=William|publisher=London Society for Theater Research|year=1956|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Falocco argues that, by choosing to perform both Q1 and ''Fratricide Punished,'' Poel was demonstrating a willingness to disregard the importance of Shakespeare's authorship in the text, in accordance with earlier understandings of authorship, a constant facet of ''Hamlet'' discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reimagining Shakespeare's Playhouse|last=Falocco|first=Joe|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not to say that ''Fratricide Punished'' is without influence on theatrical productions. Both Q1 Hamlet and ''Fratricide Punished'' place their scenes in a different order than do the Q2 and folio versions of ''Hamlet'', and this may have inspired stage directors to reorder their own productions of ''Hamlet'' in turn.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== U.S. Productions ===
A version of ''Fratricide Punished'' was performed at the NADA theater in New York City for the ''Hamlet'' Festival of 1994 alongside a rap version of ''Hamlet'' entitled "The Trage-D of Prince Hammy T."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Arts and Leisure Guide|last=|first=|date=September 11, 1994|work=The New York Times|newspaper=|access-date=|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was directed by Randolph Curtis Rand.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; According to one reviewer, Rand chose to abandon more staid stage interpretations of ''Hamlet'' in order to highlight the comical elements of ''Fratricide Punished''. Toward that end, Hamlet himself was portrayed wearing a loud tuxedo costume reminiscent of [[John Travolta]]'s character in ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' while the characters of the induction were portrayed as though members of [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McFeely|first=Maureen|year=1995|title=The NADA Hamlet Festival|url=|journal=Shakespeare Bulletin|volume=13|issue=4|pages=11|via=DSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Puppet Productions ====
In 1981, Nino Amico suggested that ''Fratricide Punished'' was a play adapted for performance by puppets, sparking mild academic debate as well as the imagination of theater producers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Hidden Room Theatre company, following up on the extensive research done by Tiffany Stern on Amico's claims, produced a puppet version that included live musical accompaniment and pyrotechnics. The initial production was performed in [[Staunton, Virginia]] at the [[American Shakespeare Center|American Shakespeare Center's]] reproduction of the [[Blackfriars Theatre|Blackfriars Theater]] and went on for a full run in [[Austin, Texas]]. The company also performed ''Fratricide Punished'' at [[Shakespeare's Globe|Shakespeare's Globe Theater]], [[University College, Oxford]], and the [[Shakespeare Institute]], as well as at [[Villanova University]] in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], with a talk from noted Shakespeare scholar Zachary Lesser of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and at other universities.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hiddenroomtheatre.com/past/der-bestrafte-brudermord-or-hamlet-prince-of-denmark/|title=Der Bestrafte Brudermord|last=|first=|date=|website=The Hidden Room|publisher=The Hidden Room Theater Company|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/artsci/english/newsandevents/hiddenroom.html|title=Hidden Room Theatre—Der Bestrafte Brudermord|last=|first=|date=|website=Liberal Arts and Sciences|publisher=Villanova University|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used a translation provided by Christine Schmidle, who had previously performed a German-language version of ''Fratricide Punished'' at the Center in 2010.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The Hidden Room Theatre won multiple awards for their performance, which was renewed for the 2016 season.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Despite this success, the central premise of the performance remains unconvincing to some. June Schlueter, responding to Tiffany Stern's article, saw no basis for the assumption that ''Fratricide Punished'' was a play designed for puppets. Instead, she claims that the elements which lend themselves to puppets, such as the plays slapstick humor and physicality, are the result of actors adapting the work to make it more accessible beyond language barriers—a theme that Christine Schmidle also explored in her German language production of the play.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schlueter|first=June|year=2014|title=No Puppets Dallying: Green's 1626 Production of Hamlet|url=|journal=Shakespeare Bulletin|volume=32.4|pages=613–628|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== German Language Production ====
''Fratricide Punished'' was performed in German at the American Shakespeare Center in 2010. The performance was conceived by Christine Schmidle, who would go on to translate the play for the 2015 puppet show there. Schmidle, like many scholars, believed the work to be the result of English comedic actors touring continental Europe in the late 1500s. By performing the play in German to an English speaking audience, she hoped to replicate (albeit in reverse) the kind of problems that those actors would have experienced in conveying meaning across language barriers. In an essay published by the ''[[Shakespeare Bulletin]]'', Schmidle described the kinds of abridgments and added physicality that her troupe undertook in creating a play that would be accessible to the audience. Ultimately, she decided that ''Fratricide Punished'' represented a kind of road map to the play's origins, and that her performance clearly demonstrated that the differences existing between ''Hamlet'' and the text were made entirely in order to better convey meaning.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''Goddess on the Throne''' ({{Lang-sq|Hyjnesha në fron}}, {{lang-sr|Богиња на трону/Boginja na tronu}}) is a [[terracotta]] figurine found at the site of the Tjerrtorja spinning mill near [[Pristina]], [[Kosovo]]{{smallsup|a}}, in 1956. The archaeological work of the [[National Museum of Serbia]] was led by the curator Radoslav Galović. The genderless seated terracotta figure is a well-preserved specimen of small Neolithic plastic [[Vinca culture]] (18.5&amp;nbsp;cm high), dated four millennia before Christ in the Vinča culture (also known as Turda culture or Turda-Vinča culture) in Kosovo .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Roman army as a community|first1=Adrian Keith|last1=Goldsworthy|first2=Ian|last2=Haynes|first3=Colin E.

The figurine represents a female deity, reflecting the cult of the great mother idol. It is preserved in the [[Kosovo Museum|Museum of Kosovo]]. The Kosovo Museum has adopted the image of the 'Goddess on the Throne' as the institution’s distinctive logo. Furthermore, as it is one of the most precious archaeological artifacts of Kosovo, it has been adopted as the symbol of Pristina.&lt;ref&gt;Berisha, Milot (2012) Archaeological Guide of Kosovo.- Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport, Archaeological Institute of Kosovo,Pristhina, p.42 ''[http://www.mkrs-ks.org/repository/docs/drafti_i_guides_-anglisht_final.pdf Last accessed 27 May 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Green Anarchy''''' was a [[magazine]] published by a collective located in [[Eugene, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Theodore J.

It had a circulation of 8,000, partly in prisons, the prison subscribers given free copies of each issue as stated in the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A28655 Wild Times Ahead] by Bill O'Driscoll, ''Pittsburgh City Paper'', July 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Green Anarchy was started in 2000 and in 2009 the Green Anarchy website shut down, leaving a final, brief message about the cessation of the magazine's publication.

The subtitle of the magazine is "An Anti-Civilization Journal of Theory and Action".

Back issues are still available from their address.

'''Hecate''' is the name of a fictional deity appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], based on the [[Hecate|Greek goddess of the same name]]. Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Sal Buscema]], she first appeared in ''Ms. Marvel'' 11 (1977).

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=June 2018}}

==Fictional character biography==
Hecate is among the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] who ruled the ancient world that [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]] spares when he deposes them and conquers Olympus, and becomes Olympus' resident Goddess of Magic. She is the first deity to give magic to mortals, in defiance of Zeus who had forbidden the gods from meddling with humans. Zeus later exiles her from Olympus, wiping her memories and stripping her of her powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Herc'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

Hecate appears on Earth, claiming to be an extra-dimensional explorer, mistaken for [[Hecate]] on a visit to the planet some millenia prior. At one point she fights [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ms. Marvel'' #11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point, she loses more of her memories and becomes an inmate of the Raft.{{issue|date=June 2018}} During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Hecate is among the Raft inmates who escape after [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] in the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone levels it. She assists [[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]], [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]], and [[Man-Bull]] in a bank robbery until [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] arrives and recognizes her. Hecate shortly regains her memories, recovers her godly abilities, and decides to take over [[Brooklyn]],&lt;ref&gt;''Herc'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; reshaping the borough to resemble a monster-infested [[Ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;''Herc'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; Hercules kills her ally [[Kyknos (comics)|Kyknos]] and she flees as Brooklyn returns to its normal state.&lt;ref&gt;''Herc'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later, the [[Scarlet Witch]] seeks out Hecate after sensing a disturbance in witchcraft. She finds her operating a café on a Greek island and asks for her help. Hecate explains that she is content to remain uninvolved with the world of witchcraft, but mentions that there is a magical disturbance on the island, which could support Wanda's theory that magic is broken. She asks Wanda to defeat a [[Minotaur]] that has been murdering islanders, and the heroine discovers that the Emerald Warlock, a century-old mage, had forcibly transformed Man-Bull to do his bidding.&lt;ref&gt;''Scarlet Witch'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
During her exile, Hecate was solely capable of shapeshifting, projecting energy bolts, and bringing images from others' minds to life.

When her memories returned, Hecate regained her Olympian characteristics, which includes superhuman strength (lifting 25 tons), durability, speed, and endurance.&lt;ref&gt;''Herc'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; She is also immortal and unaging, immune to all human ailments and diseases. As the Olympian goddess of magic, Hecate is an extremely powerful sorceress and has been invoked by mortal magic users in the casting of spells. She can release powerful energy blasts, read other's thoughts, shape-shift, and alter the form of other people and objects. Her skill in magic is so great that when she warped reality around Brooklyn and its inhabitants, she did so without depending on external sources for increased magical power.&lt;ref&gt;''Herc'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; She also has some influence over dogs and her presence alone causes all canines in a certain radius around her to become vicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic

The [[social construction]] of [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]]—its [[taboo]]s, [[regulation]], and [[sociology|social]] and [[politics|political]] impact—has had a profound effect on the various [[culture]]s of the world since [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times.

==The study of the history of human sexuality==
The work of Swiss jurist [[Johann Bachofen]] made a major impact on the study of the history of sexuality. Many authors, notably [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], were influenced by Bachofen, and criticized Bachofen's ideas on the subject, which were almost entirely drawn from a close reading of ancient mythology. In his 1861 book ''Mother Right: An Investigation of the Religious and Juridical Character of Matriarchy in the Ancient World'' Bachofen writes that in the beginning human sexuality was chaotic and promiscuous. This "aphroditic" stage was replaced by a matriarchal "demeteric" stage, which resulted from the mother being the only reliable way of establishing descendants. Only upon the switch to male-enforced monogamy was paternity certainty possible, giving rise to patriarchy – the ultimate "apolloan" stage of humanity. While the views of Bachofen are not based on empirical evidence, they are important because of the impact they made on thinkers to come, especially in the field of [[cultural anthropology]].
Modern explanations of the origins of human sexuality are based in [[evolutionary biology]], and specifically the field of [[human behavioral ecology]]. Evolutionary biology shows that the human genotype, like that of all other organisms, is the result of those ancestors who reproduced with greater frequency than others. The resultant sexual behavior adaptations are thus not an "attempt" on the part of the individual to maximize reproduction in a given situation – natural selection does not "see" into the future. Instead, current behavior is probably the result of selective forces that occurred in the Pleistocene.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SxX4gRzOS6oC&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;ots=Bf2t9L2LvI&amp;dq=use%20and%20misusse%20of%20darwinism%20symons&amp;pg=PA219#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Adapted Mind (Google Books Link)] "Cognitive Adaptations for Social Change" by Leda Cosmides and John Tooby, page 219.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a man trying to have sex with many women all while avoiding parental investment is not doing so because he wants to "increase his fitness", but because the psychological framework that evolved and thrived in the Pleistocene never went away.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SxX4gRzOS6oC&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;ots=Bf2t9L2LvI&amp;dq=use%20and%20misusse%20of%20darwinism%20symons&amp;pg=PA137#v=twopage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Adapted Mind (Google Books Link)] On the Use and Misuse of Darwinism in the Study of Human Behavior by Donald Symons, page 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual speech—and by extension, writing—has been subject to varying standards of decorum since the beginning of [[history]]. For most of historic time writing has not been used by more than a small part of the total population of any society. The resulting self-censorship and euphemistic forms translate today into a dearth of explicit and accurate evidence on which to base a history. There are a number of primary sources that can be collected across a wide variety of times and cultures, including the following:
* Records of legislation indicating either encouragement or prohibition
* [[Religious]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] texts recommending, condemning or debating the topic
* Literary sources, perhaps unpublished during their authors' lifetimes, including diaries and personal correspondence
* [[Medical]] textbooks treating various forms as a pathological condition
* Linguistic developments, particularly in slang.
* More recently, studies of sexuality

[[File:Khajuraho12.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Depictions of [[Apsaras]]es from the [[Khajuraho]] temple]]India played a significant role in the history of sex, from writing one of the first literature that treated [[sexual intercourse]] as a science, to in modern times being the origin of the philosophical focus of [[New Age|new-age]] groups' attitudes on sex. It may be argued that India pioneered the use of [[sexual education]] through art and literature. As in many societies, there was a difference in sexual practices in India between common people and powerful rulers, with people in power often indulging in hedonistic lifestyles that were not representative of common moral attitudes. Many of the common (and not so common) sexual practices in the world today, such as the custom and art of kissing emerged in India, proliferating with early forms of globalization.

[[File:Meister des Mahâjanaka Jâtaka 001.jpg|thumb|Fresco murals from the Ajanta caves]]

The first evidence of attitudes towards sex comes from the ancient texts of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], the first of which are perhaps the oldest surviving literature in the world. These most ancient texts, the [[Rig Veda|Vedas]], reveal moral perspectives on sexuality, marriage and fertility prayers. [[Sex magic]] featured in a number of Vedic rituals, most significantly in the [[Ashvamedha|Asvamedha Yajna]], where the ritual culminated with the chief queen lying with the dead horse in a simulated sexual act; clearly a fertility rite intended to safeguard and increase the kingdom's productivity and martial prowess. The epics of ancient India, the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], which may have been first composed as early as 1400 BCE, had a huge effect on the culture of [[Asia]], influencing later [[China|Chinese]], [[Japan]]ese, [[Tibet]]an and [[South East Asia]]n culture. These texts support the view that in ancient India, sex was considered a mutual duty between a married couple, where husband and wife pleasured each other equally, but where sex was considered a private affair, at least by followers of the aforementioned Indian religions. It seems that [[polygamy]] was allowed during ancient times. In practice, this seems to have only been practiced by rulers, with common people maintaining a monogamous marriage. It is common in many cultures for a ruling class to practice polygamy as a way of preserving dynastic succession

The most publicly known sexual literature of India are the texts of the [[Kama Sutra]]. These texts were written for and kept by the philosopher, warrior and nobility castes, their servants and concubines, and those in certain religious orders. These were people that could also read and write and had instruction and education. The sixty four arts of love-passion-pleasure began in India. There are many different versions of the arts which began in [[Sanskrit]] and were translated into other languages, such as Persian or Tibetan. Many of the original texts are missing and the only clue to their existence is in other texts. [[Kama Sutra]], the version by Vatsyayana, is one of the well-known survivors and was first translated into [[English language|English]] by Sir [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard Burton]] and F. F. Arbuthnot. The [[Kama Sutra]] is now perhaps the most widely read secular text in the world. It details ways in which partners should pleasure each other within a marital relationship.

[[File:Khajurahosculpture.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture from a temple at Khajuraho]]
When the [[Islamic]] and [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] [[English people|English]] culture arrived in India, they generally had an adverse impact on sexual liberalism in India. Within the context of the Indian religions, or dharmas, such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], sex is generally either seen as a moral duty of each partner in a long term marriage relationship to the other, or is seen as a desire which hinders spiritual detachment, and so must be renounced. In modern India, a renaissance of sexual liberalism has occurred amongst the well-educated urban population, but there is still discrimination and forced marriage incidents amongst the poor.

Within certain schools of Indian philosophy, such as [[Tantra]], the emphasis in sex as a sacred duty, or even a path to spiritual enlightenment or yogic balance is greatly emphasized. Actual sexual intercourse is not a part of every form of tantric practice, but it is the definitive feature of left-hand Tantra. Contrary to popular belief, "Tantric sex" is not always slow and sustained, and may end in orgasm. For example, the Yoni Tantra states: "there should be vigorous copulation". However, all tantra states that there were certain groups of personalities who were not fit for certain practices. Tantra was personality specific and insisted that those with pashu-bhava (animal disposition), which are people of dishonest, promiscuous, greedy or violent natures who ate meat and indulged in intoxication, would only incur bad karma by following Tantric paths without the aid of a Guru who could instruct them on the correct path. In Buddhist tantra, actual ejaculation is very much a taboo, as the main goal of the sexual practice is to use the sexual energy towards achieving full enlightenment, rather than ordinary pleasure. [[Tantric sex]] is considered to be a pleasurable experience in Tantra philosophy.

===China===
In the ''[[I Ching]]'' (The ''Book of Changes'', a Chinese classic text dealing with divination) sexual intercourse is one of two fundamental models used to explain the world. With neither embarrassment nor circumlocution, Heaven is described as having sexual intercourse with Earth. Similarly, with no sense of prurient interest, the male lovers of early Chinese men of great political power are mentioned in one of the earliest great works of philosophy and literature, the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuang Zi]]'' (or ''Chuang Tzu'', as it is written in the old system of romanization).

China has had a long history of sexism, with even moral leaders such as Confucius giving extremely pejorative accounts of the innate characteristics of women. From early times, the [[virginity]] of women was rigidly enforced by family and community and linked to the monetary value of women as a kind of commodity (the "sale" of women involving the delivery of a [[bride price]]). Men were protected in their own sexual adventures by a transparent double standard. While the first wife of a man with any kind of social status in traditional society was almost certainly chosen for him by his [[father]] and/or [[grandfather]], the same man might later secure for himself more desirable sexual partners with the status of concubines. In addition, [[serfdom|bondservants]] in his possession could also be sexually available to him. Naturally, not all men had the financial resources to so greatly indulge themselves.

Chinese literature displays a long history of interest in affection, marital bliss, unabashed sexuality, romance, amorous dalliances, homosexual alliances—in short, all of the aspects of behavior that are affiliated with sexuality in the West. Besides the previously mentioned ''Zhuang Zi'' passages, sexuality is exhibited in other works of literature such as the [[Tang dynasty]] ''[[Yingying zhuan]]'' (''[[Biography of Cui Yingying]]''), the [[Qing dynasty]] ''[[Fu sheng liu ji]]'' (''[[Six Chapters of a Floating Life]]''), the humorous and intentionally salacious ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]'', and the multi-faceted and insightful ''[[Hong lou meng]]'' (''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'', also called ''[[Story of the Stone]]''). Of the above, only the story of Yingying and her de facto husband Zhang fail to describe homosexual as well as heterosexual interactions. The novel entitled ''[[Rou bu tuan]]'' (''[[Prayer mat of flesh]]'') even describes cross-species organ transplants for the sake of enhanced sexual performance. Among Chinese literature are the [[Taoist]] classical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigeye.com/sexeducation/ancientchina.html bigeye.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophical tradition of China has developed [[Taoist Sexual Practices]] which have three main goals: health, longevity, and spiritual development.

The desire for respectability and the belief that all aspects of human behavior might be brought under government control has until recently mandated to official Chinese spokesmen that they maintain the fiction of sexual fidelity in marriage, absence of any great frequency of [[premarital sexual intercourse]], and total absence in China of the so-called "decadent capitalist phenomenon" of homosexuality. The result of the ideological demands preventing objective examination of sexual behavior in China has, until very recently, made it extremely difficult for the government to take effective action against [[sexually transmitted diseases]], especially [[AIDS]]. At the same time, large migrations to the cities coupled with China's gender imbalance and significant amounts of unemployment have led to resurgence of prostitution in unregulated venues, a prominent accelerant of the propagation of STDs to many ordinary members of society.

In recent decades the power of the family over individuals has weakened, making it increasingly possible for young men and women to find their own sexual and/or marriage partners.

{{Main|Sexuality in Japan}}
In what is often called the world's first novel, the ''[[Genji Monogatari]]'' (''[[Tale of Genji]]''), which dates back to around the eighth century AD, eroticism is treated as a central part of the aesthetic life of the nobility. The sexual interactions of Prince Genji are described in great detail, in an objective tone of voice, and in a way that indicates that sexuality was as much a valued component of cultured life as music or any of the arts. While most of his erotic interactions involve women, there is one telling episode in which Genji travels a fairly long distance to visit one of the women with whom he occasionally consorts but finds her away from home. It being late, and intercourse already being on the menu of the day, Genji takes pleasure in the availability of the lady's younger brother who, he reports, is equally satisfactory as an erotic partner.

From that time on to at least as late as the [[Meiji Reformation]], there is no indication that sexuality was treated in a pejorative way. In modern times homosexuality was driven out of sight until it reemerged in the wake of the sexual revolution with seemingly little if any need for a period of acceleration. [[Yukio Mishima]], probably the best-known Japanese writer in the outside world, frequently wrote about homosexuality, and its relationship with Japanese culture new and old. Likewise, prostitution, pornography, the tradition of the [[Geisha]], and countless types of fetish and sadomasochism have resurfaced after decades underground.

In Japan, sexuality was governed by the same social forces that make its culture considerably different from that of China, Korea, India, or Europe. In Japanese society, the primary method used to secure social control is the threat of ostracism. Japanese society is still very much a [[shame society]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}  More attention is paid to what is polite or appropriate to show others than to which behaviors might make a person seem "corrupt" or "guilty", in the Christian sense of the words. The tendency of people in Japanese society to group in terms of "in groups" and "out groups" - residue of its long history as a caste society – is a source of great pressure on every facet of society, via pop culture (reflected in the tribal, often materialistic, and very complex nature of teenage subcultures) as well as more traditional standards (as in the high-pressure role of the [[salaryman]]). Sexual expression ranges from a requirement to a complete taboo, and many, especially teenagers, find themselves playing many otherwise strictly-separate roles during the week.

A frequent locus of misconceptions in regard to Japanese sexuality is the institution of the [[geisha]]. Rather than being a prostitute, a geisha was a woman trained in arts such as music and cultured conversation, and who was available for non-sexual interactions with her male clientele. These women differed from the wives that their patrons probably had at home because, except for the geisha, women were ordinarily not expected to be prepared for anything other than the fulfillment of household duties. This limitation imposed by the normal social role of the majority of women in traditional society produced a diminution in the pursuits that those women could enjoy, but also a limitation in the ways that a man could enjoy the company of his wife. The geisha fulfilled the non-sexual social roles that ordinary women were prevented from fulfilling, and for this service they were well paid. The geisha were not deprived of opportunities to express themselves sexually and in other erotic ways. A geisha might have a patron with whom she enjoyed sexual intimacy, but this sexual role was not part of her role or responsibility as a geisha.

As a superficial level, in traditional Japanese society women were expected to be highly subservient to men and especially to their husbands. So, in a socionormal description of their roles, they were little more than housekeepers and faithful sexual partners to their husbands. Their husbands, on the other hand, might consort sexually with whomever they chose outside of the family, and a major part of male social behavior involves after-work forays to places of entertainment in the company of male cohorts from the workplace—places that might easily offer possibilities of sexual satisfaction outside the family. In the postwar period this side of Japanese society has seen some liberalization in regard to the norms imposed on women as well as an expansion of the de facto powers of women in the family and in the community that existed unacknowledged in traditional society.

In the years since people first became aware of the AIDS epidemic, Japan has not suffered the high rates of disease and death that characterize, for example, some nations in Africa, some nations in Southeast Asia, etc. In 1992, the government of Japan justified its continued refusal to allow oral contraceptives to be distributed in Japan on the fear that it would lead to reduced condom use, and thus increase transmission of AIDS.&lt;!--

===Classical antiquity===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}

====Greece====
[[File:Kiss Briseis Painter Louvre G278 full.jpg|thumb|A man kisses his younger lover on a cup ''ca.'' 480BC]]
{{See also|Homosexuality in ancient Greece|Pederasty in ancient Greece|Prostitution in ancient Greece}}

In ancient [[Greece]], the [[phallus]], often in the form of a [[herma]], was an object of worship as a symbol of fertility. This finds expression in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[sculpture]] and other artworks. One ancient Greek male idea of female sexuality was that women envied penises of males. Wives were considered as commodity and instruments for bearing legitimate children. They had to compete sexually with [[eromenoi]], [[hetaera]]s and slaves in their own homes.

Both [[Homosexuality]] and [[Bisexuality]], in the form of ephebophilia (in some ways slavery), were social institutions in ancient Greece, and were integral to education, art, religion, and politics. Relationships between adults were not unknown but they were disfavored. [[Lesbian]] relations were also of a pederastic nature.

In ancient Greece, it was common for men to have sexual relationships with youths. These practices were a sign of maturity for youths, who looked up to men as sexual mentors.

Ancient Greek men believed that refined [[Prostitution in ancient Greece|prostitution]] was necessary for pleasure and different classes of prostitutes were available. Hetaera, educated and intelligent companions, were for intellectual as well as physical pleasure, [[Nomad|Peripatetic]] prostitutes solicited business on the streets, whereas temple or consecrated prostitutes charged a higher price. In [[Corinth]], a port city, on the [[Aegean Sea]], the temple held a thousand consecrated prostitutes.

[[Rape]] – usually in the context of warfare – was common and was seen by men as a “right of domination”. Rape in the sense of "abduction" followed by consensual lovemaking was represented even in religion: [[Zeus]] was said to have ravished many women: Leda in the form of a swan, [[Danaë]] disguised as a golden rain, [[Alkmene]] disguised as her own husband. Zeus also raped a boy, [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], a myth that paralleled [[Cretan pederasty|Cretan]] custom.

====Etruria====
The ancient [[Etruscans]] had very different views on sexuality, when compared with the other European ancient peoples, most of whom had inherited the Indo-European traditions and views on the gender roles.

Greek writers, such as [[Theopompus]] and [[Plato]] named the Etruscan 'immoral' and from their descriptions we find out that the women commonly had sex with men who were not their husbands and that in their society, children were not labelled "[[illegitimacy|illegitimate]]" just because they did not know who the father was. Theopompus also described orgiastic rituals, but it is not clear whether they were a common custom or only a minor ritual dedicated to a certain deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38040291|title=Theopompus of Chios : history and rhetoric in the fourth century BC|last=A.|first=Flower, Michael|date=1997|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0198152434|location=Oxford|oclc=38040291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent virtue for [[Women in Ancient Rome|female citizens]] of good social standing was ''[[pudicitia]]'', a form of sexual integrity that displayed their attractiveness and self-control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rebecca Langlands]], ''Sexual Morality in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp. 37–38 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Female sexuality|Female sexuality]] was encouraged [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Marital sex|within marriage]]. In [[paterfamilias|Roman patriarchal society]], a "real man" was supposed to govern both himself and others well, and should not submit to the use or pleasure of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992, 2002, originally published 1988 in Italian), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|Same-sex behaviors]] were not perceived as diminishing a Roman's masculinity, as long as he played the penetrative or dominating role. Acceptable male partners were social inferiors such as [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|prostitutes, entertainers]], and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|slaves]]. [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|Sex with freeborn male minors]] was formally prohibited (see ''[[Lex Scantinia]]''). "Homosexual" and "heterosexual" thus did not form the primary dichotomy of Roman thinking about sexuality, and no [[Latin]] words for these concepts exist.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), p. 304, citing Saara Lilja, ''Homosexuality in Republican and Augustan Rome'' (Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1983), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of frank sexuality are abundant in [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Erotic literature and art|Roman literature and art]]. The ''[[fascinum]]'', a [[phallic]] charm, was a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Phallic sexuality|ubiquitous decoration]]. [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sex acts and positions|Sexual positions and scenarios]] are depicted in great variety among the [[Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum|wall paintings preserved at Pompeii and Herculaneum]]. Collections of poetry celebrated love affairs, and ''[[Ars Amatoria|The Art of Love]]'' by the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan poet]] [[Ovid]] playfully instructed both men and women in how to attract and enjoy lovers. Elaborate theories of human sexuality based on [[ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]] were developed by thinkers such as [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Epicurean sexuality|Lucretius]] and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Stoic sexual morality|Seneca]]. [[Classical mythology|Classical myths]] often deal with sexual themes such as [[gender identity]], [[adultery]], [[incest]], and [[rape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/212125918|title=Sexuality and gender in the classical world : readings and sources|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|others=McClure, Laura, 1959-, Wiley InterScience (Online service)|isbn=0470755539|location=Oxford, UK|oclc=212125918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other aspects of Roman life, sexuality was supported and regulated by [[Religion in ancient Rome|traditional Roman religion]], both the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sex, religion and the state|public cult of the state]] and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Healing and magic|private religious practices and magic]].&lt;ref&gt;As argued by Ariadne Staples throughout ''From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion'' (Routledge, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] held that the desire to procreate ''([[libido]])'' was "the seedbed of the republic," as it was the cause for the first form of social institution, [[Marriage in ancient Rome|marriage]], which in turn created the family, regarded by the Romans as the building block of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De officiis]]'' 1.17.54; Sabine MacCormack, "Sin, Citizenship, and the Salvation of Souls: The Impact of Christian Priorities on Late-Roman and Post-Roman Society," ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 39.4 (1997), p. 651.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman law]] penalized sex crimes ''([[stuprum]])'', particularly [[History of rape#Ancient Rome|rape]], as well as [[Marriage in ancient Rome#Adultery|adultery]]. A Roman husband, however, committed the crime of adultery only when his sexual partner was a married woman.

[[Prostitution in ancient Rome|Prostitution]] was legal, public, and widespread. Entertainers of any gender were assumed to be sexually available (see ''[[infamia]]''), and [[gladiator]]s were sexually [[Glamour (presentation)|glamorous]]. [[Slavery in ancient Rome|Slaves]] lacked [[legal person]]hood, and were vulnerable to [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|sexual exploitation]].

The dissolution of Republican ideals of physical integrity in relation to political liberty contributes to and is reflected by the sexual license and decadence associated with the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;This is a theme throughout Carlin A. Barton, ''The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster'' (Princeton University Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Anxieties about the loss of liberty and the subordination of the citizen to the emperor were expressed by a perceived increase in passive homosexual behavior among free men.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, "Sexuality in the Roman Empire," in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire'', p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexual conquest and imperialism|Sexual conquest]] was a frequent metaphor for Roman imperialism.:&lt;ref&gt;Davina C.

Children slept in the same room as their parents and were able to witness their parents while they had sex. Intercourse simulation became real penetration as soon as boys were physically able. Adults found simulation of sex by children to be funny. As children approached 11 attitudes shifted toward girls.

Premarital sex was not encouraged but was allowed in general, restrictions on adolescent sexuality were incest, exogamy regulations, and  firstborn daughters of high-ranking lineage. After their firstborn child, high-ranking women were permitted extramarital affairs.

===Twentieth Century: Sexual revolution===
{{Main|Sexual revolution}}

The second sexual revolution was a substantial change in [[sexual morality]] and [[human sexual behaviour|sexual behaviour]] throughout the West in the 1960s and early 1970s. One factor in the change of values pertaining to sexual activities was the invention of new, efficient technologies for the personal control of ability to enter pregnancy. Prime among them, at that time, was the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|first birth control pill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/pill-and-marriage-revolution|title=The pill and the marriage revolution {{!}} The Clayman Institute for Gender Research|website=gender.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberalized laws on abortion in many countries likewise made it possible to safely and legally break off an unwanted pregnancy without having to invoke a birth posing grave danger to the health of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903358,00.html?promoid=googlep%7ctitle=Abortion_and_Privacy%7caccessdate=2013-12-13|work=Time|date=13 March 1972|title=The Law: Abortion and Privacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of homosexuality}}
Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied over time and place, from expecting all males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death.

In a detailed compilation of historical and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] materials of [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial cultures]], "strong disapproval of homosexuality was reported for 41% of 42 cultures; it was accepted or ignored by 21%, and 12% reported no such concept. Of 70 ethnographies, 59% reported homosexuality absent or rare in frequency and 41% reported it present or not uncommon." &lt;ref&gt;Adolescence and puberty By John Bancroft, June Machover Reinisch, p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultures influenced by [[Abrahamic religions]], the [[Sodomy law#History|law]] and the [[Christianity and homosexuality#History of Christianity and homosexuality|church]] established [[sodomy]] as a transgression against divine law or a [[crime against nature]]. The condemnation of [[anal sex]] between males, however, predates Christian belief. It was frequent in ancient Greece; "unnatural" can be traced back to [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;"... sow illegitimate and bastard seed in [[courtesan]]s, or sterile seed in males in defiance of nature." — [[Plato]], in ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' (Book VIII p.841 edition of Stephanus or p.340, edition of Penguin Books, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historical figures, including [[Socrates]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], and [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Homosexuality'', Craig Arthur Williams, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; have had terms such as ''gay'' or ''[[bisexuality|bisexual]]'' applied to them; some scholars, such as [[Michel Foucault]], have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary [[social constructionism|construction]] of sexuality foreign to their times,&lt;ref name="foucault"&gt;{{harv|Foucault|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; though others challenge this.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Hubbard, Review of David M. Halperin, ''How to Do the History of Homosexuality.'' in ''[[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]]'' 2003.09.22&lt;/ref&gt;

A common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. John Boswell has countered this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by Plato,&lt;ref name=boswell1&gt;{{harv|Boswell|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality.

==Religion and sex==
{{Main|Religion and sexuality}}

===Judaism===
In Jewish law, sex is not considered intrinsically sinful or shameful when conducted in marriage, nor is it a necessary evil for the purpose of procreation. Sex is considered a private and holy act between a husband and wife. Certain deviant sexual practices, enumerated below, were considered gravely immoral "abominations" sometimes punishable by death. The residue of sex was considered ritually unclean outside the body, and required [[Ritual washing in Judaism|ablution]].&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baarda|first1=Benjamin I.|last2=Sikora|first2=Aleksandra E.|title=Proteomics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: the treasure hunt for countermeasures against an old disease|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=6|year=2015|issn=1664-302X|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.01190|postscript=; Access provided by the [[University of Pittsburgh]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, some scholars have questioned whether the Old Testament banned all forms of homosexuality, raising issues of translation and references to ancient cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shrine Prostitutes – Is THAT what Moses was talking about in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13?|url=http://www.gaychristian101.com/Shrine-Prostitutes.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rabbinic Judaism had unambiguously condemned homosexuality.

====Mosaic law====
*''And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the sky and over all the beasts that tread upon the earth.'' (Genesis 1:28)

The [[Torah]], while being quite frank in its description of various sexual acts, forbids certain relationships. Namely, [[adultery]], all forms of [[incest]], male [[homosexuality]], [[bestiality]], and introduced the idea that one should not have sex during the wife's [[Menstrual cycle|period]]:
*''You shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife, to become defiled by her.'' (Lev. 18:20)
*''Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.'' (Lev. 18:22)
*''And with no animal shall you cohabit, to become defiled by it. And a woman shall not stand in front of an animal to cohabit with it; this is depravity.'' (Lev. 18:23)
*''And to a woman during the uncleanness of her separation, you shall not come near to uncover her nakedness.'' (Lev. 18:19)

The above passages may, however, be open to modern interpretation. The original meanings of these verses did not change, but their interpretation may have changed after they were translated into English and other languages. This view however, has been counteracted by conservatives.

===Christianity===
Christianity re-emphasised the Jewish attitudes on sexuality with two new concepts. First, there was the re-iterated idea that marriage was absolutely exclusive and indissoluble, placing further guidance on divorce and expanding on the reasons and principles behind those laws. Second, in Old Testament times marriage was almost universal, in continuity with the total matrimony in Eden, but in the New Testament, the trajectory is extended forward to the goal of no marriage in the new heavens and new earth (see Matthew 22). Practically therefore the new age after Jesus now has marriage as only normative, but celibacy is a valuable gift in and of itself.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

====New Testament====
The [[New Testament]] is quite clear on principles regarding sexual relations. In one of his letters to the Corinthian church, Paul directly answers some questions they had asked about this.

{{quote|1 Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: 'It is well for a man not to touch a woman.' 2 But because of cases of sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. 3 The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. 4 For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. 5 Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 6 This I say by way of concession, not of command. 7 I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind." (1 Corinthians 7:1-9, NRSV)}}

Paul is speaking into a situation where the church was falling into lust, and some members even using prostitutes (6:16), while others advocated a 'higher spirituality' that wrongly denied pleasure from earthly things, including abstinence from sex (7:1). Paul writes to them to explain the right context for sex in marriage, and the importance of couples keeping having sex and giving each other pleasure, but encourages them to pursue celibacy (as he later explains [7:32-35], so that they may devote more time and energy to others) wherever God has granted that gift (7:7).

Many other passages refer to sex or marriage.

====Later Christian thought====
St. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] opined that before Adam's fall, there was no lust in the sexual act, but that it was entirely subordinate to human reason. Later theologians similarly concluded that the lust involved in sexuality was a result of [[original sin]], but nearly all agreed that this was only a venial sin if conducted within marriage without inordinate lust.

In Reformed schools, as represented for example by the [[Westminster Confession]], three purposes of marriage are drawn out: for mutual encouragement, support, and pleasure; for having children; and to prevent lustful sin.

Today, many Christians have adopted the view that there is no sin whatsoever in the uninhibited enjoyment of marital relations. Some Christians will tend to limit the circumstances and degree to which sexual pleasure is morally licit, for example to build self-control to prevent sex becoming addictive, or as a fast.

===Hinduism===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}

In India, [[Hinduism]] accepted an open attitude towards sex as an art, science and spiritual practice. The most famous pieces of Indian literature on sex are [[Kamasutra]] (Aphorisms on Love) and [[Kamashastra]] (from Kama = pleasure, shastra = specialised knowledge or technique). This collection of explicit sexual writings, both spiritual and practical, covers most aspects of human courtship and sexual intercourse. It was put together in this form by the sage [[Vatsyayana]] from a 150 chapter manuscript that had itself been distilled from 300 chapters that had in turn come from a compilation of some 100,000 chapters of text. The Kamasutra is thought to have been written in its final form sometime between the third and fifth century AD.

Also notable are the sculptures carved on temples in India, particularly the [[Khajuraho]] temple. The frank depiction of uninhibited sex hints towards a liberated society and times where people believed in dealing openly with all aspects of life. On the other hand, a group of thinkers believe that depiction of sexually implicit carvings outside the temples indicate that one should enter the temples leaving desires (kama).

Apart from Vatsyayana's Kamashastra, which is no doubt the most famous of all such writings, there exist a number of other books, for example:
*The ''[[Ratirahasya]]'', literal translation – secrets (rahasya) of love (rati, the union);
*The ''[[Panchasakya]]'', or the five (panch) arrows (sakya);
*The ''[[Ratimanjari]]'', or the garland (manjari) of love (rati, the union)
*The ''[[Anunga Runga]]'', or the stage of love.

The ''Secrets of Love'' was written by a poet named Kukkoka. He is believed to have written this treatise on his work to please one Venudutta, considered to be a king. This work was translated into Hindi years ago and the author's name became Koka in short and the book he wrote was called ''[[Ratirahasya|Koka Shastra]]''. The same name crept into all the translations into other languages in India. ''Koka Shastra'' literally means doctrines of Koka, which is identical with the ''Kama Shastra'', or doctrines of love, and the names ''Koka Shastra'' and ''Kama Shastra'' are used indiscriminately.

===Islam===
In [[Islam]] sexual intercourse is allowed only after [[marriage]] and only with one's spouse. Sex outside of marriage is prohibited, called [[zina]], as is adultery, which is considered a sin and is strictly prohibited and  punishable. According to the chapter Al-Israa', verse 32 of the [[Qur'an]], [[Allah]] (God) prohibits Muslims from getting close to (engaging in) zina, and having relations with anyone other than one's spouse. And since marriage is only between a man and a woman, any sexual intercourse between two men is prohibited. Islam does not accept homosexuality or allow anal sex even between married couples or even during menstrual cycles. Furthermore, sex is like an act of charity if done with right intentions. One cannot seek sexual means outside of marriage and must lower gaze when outside.

==Technology and sex==
In the mid 20th century advances in medical science and modern understanding of the [[menstrual cycle]] led to observational, surgical, chemical and laboratory techniques to allow diagnosis and the treatment of many forms of infertility.

==Pederasty==
{{Seealso|Pederasty|Shudo|Pederasty in ancient Greece|Shunga|Shotacon}}

Many cultures normalized or promoted adult males and male youths, usually teenagers, entering into pedagogic friendships or love affairs that also had an erotic dimension. These were usually sexually expressed, but chaste ones were not infrequent. If sexual, that phase of the relationship lasted until the youth was ready for adulthood and marriage. Other cultures saw such relationships as inimical to their interests – often on religious grounds – and tried to stamp them out.

==Zoophilia==
{{Main|History of zoophilia}}
[[Zoophilia]] or bestiality—sexual activity between humans and animals—probably dates back to prehistory. Depictions of humans and animals in a sexual context appear infrequently in [[rock art]] in Europe beginning around the onset of the [[Neolithic]] and the domestication of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bahn|first=Paul G.|title=The Cambridge illustrated history of prehistoric art|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-45473-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwm_D1u_UTsC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq|accessdate=18 February 2012|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bestiality remained a common theme in mythology and folklore through the classical period and into the Middle Ages (e.g. ''[[Leda and the Swan]]'')&lt;ref name="HSEB"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Cornog|first1=M.|last2=Perper|first2=T.|year=1994|title=Bestiality|editor1-last=Haeberle|editor1-first=E.

Explicit legal prohibition of human sexual contact with animals is a legacy of the [[Abrahamic religions]]:&lt;ref name="HSEB" /&gt; the [[Hebrew Bible]] imposes the death penalty on both the person and animal involved in an act of bestiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:15|131}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several examples known from medieval Europe of people and animals executed for committing bestiality. With the [[Age of Enlightenment]], bestiality was subsumed with other sexual "crimes against nature" into civil [[sodomy]] laws, usually remaining a capital crime.

Bestiality remains [[Zoophilia and the law|illegal in most countries]]. Though religious and "crime against nature" arguments may still be used to justify this, today the central issue is the ability of non-human animals to give [[consent]]: it is argued that sex with animals is inherently [[Sexual abuse|abusive]].&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Tom. ''Animal Rights, Human Wrongs''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, pp. 63-4, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In common with many [[paraphilia]]s, the [[internet]] has allowed the formation of a zoophile community that has begun to lobby for zoophilia to be considered an alternative sexuality and for the legalisation of bestiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Francis|first=Thomas|title=Those Who Practice Bestiality Say They're Part of the Next Sexual Rights Movement|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2009-08-20/news/those-who-practice-bestiality-say-they-re-part-of-the-next-gay-rights-movement/|accessdate=18 February 2012|newspaper=Broward Palm Beach New Times|date=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prostitution==
{{Main|History of prostitution}}

[[Prostitution]] is the sale of sexual services, such as oral sex or sexual intercourse. Prostitution has been described as the "world's oldest profession". Gonorrhoeae is recorded at least up to 700 years ago and associated with a district in Paris formerly known as "Le Clapiers". This is where the prostitutes were to be found at that time.&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015" /&gt;

In some cultures, prostitution has been an element of religious practices. [[Religious prostitution]] is well documented in the ancient cultures of the near East, such as [[Sumer]], [[Babylon]], [[ancient Greece]] and [[Israel]], where prostitutes appear in the [[Bible]]. In [[Greece]] the [[hetaerae]] were often women of high social class, whereas in [[Rome]] the [[meretrices]] were of lower social order. The [[Devadasi]], prostitutes of [[Hindu]] temples in south [[India]], were made illegal by the Indian government in 1988.

==Sexually transmitted diseases==
{{Main|Sexually transmitted diseases|Safe sex}}
For much of human history, sexually transmitted diseases have been a scourge of humanity. They raged unchecked through society until the discovery of [[antibiotics]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The development of inexpensive condoms and education about sexually transmitted diseases has helped reduce risks. For a period of about thirty years (in the second half of the twentieth century) their threat subsided.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} However, due to the free movement of people and uncontrolled distribution of antibiotics, organisms resistant to antibiotics quickly spread and at the present time pose a threat to people who have more than one sex partner.

===AIDS===
{{Main|AIDS}}
AIDS has profoundly changed modern sexuality. It was first noticed (although many historians feel that the first case was in 1959) spreading among [[Homosexuality|gay]] men and [[recreational drug use|intravenous drug users]] in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, the majority of victims are [[heterosexual]] women, men, and children in [[developing countries]]. In most developing countries, fear of epidemic has drastically changed many aspects of twentieth century human sexuality. Fear of contracting AIDS has driven a revolution in [[sex education]], which now centers far more the use of protection and [[abstinence]], and spends much more time discussing sexually transmitted diseases.

Further effects of this disease run deep, radically impacting the expected average lifespan as reported by the BBC News: "[The expected average lifespan] is falling in many African countries – a girl born today in [[Sierra Leone]] could expect only to live to 36, in contrast to [[Japan]], where today's newborn girl might reach 85 on average."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3330155.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2886">'''Kvarterhuset''', located just off [[Holmbladsgade]], is a culture house run by [[Copenhagen Municipality]] in the [[Amager]] district of [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. The building is a former warehouse which was adapted and expanded for its current use by [[Dorte Mandrup]] prior to its opening in 2001. It contains the local Sundby Library as well as other facilities for the local community.

==History==
The warehouse was built for [[Lauritz Peter Holmblad]] in association with his oil mill which is still located next to the building. Holmblad had previously owned a [[stud farm]] on the site (Jemtelandsgadewas  1). The warehouse was designed by Georg Ebbe Wineken Møller , built by Christian Peter Wienberg  and inaugurated on 24 November 1880.&lt;ref name=Omhuset&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kulturogfritid.kk.dk/kvarterhuset/husets-historie-0|title=Husets historie|language=Danish|publisher=Københavns Kommune|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original address  of the warehouse was Holmbladsgade 9 but it was changed to Jemtelandsgadewas 3 when Jemtelandsgadewas and Praghs Boulevard was established in about 1916.&lt;ref name=Omhuset/&gt;

The warehouse was in 1913 sold to Johannes William Reve established a production of signs and advertisements in the building. In 1918, it changed hands once again when it was sold to A/S Kruckkow-Wadorf, a Lithography business that produced a variety of goods, including playing cards and reproductions of works by famous painters. Some 300 employees worked in the building in 1920. It has later been used for offices before it was purchased by Copenhagen Municipality in 1997 as part of the facelift of the Holmbladsgade neighbourhood.&lt;ref name=Omhuset/&gt;

==Building==
The adaption of the building removed the original floor decks to create a new, triple-high foyer space running the length of the building.&lt;ref name=arkark&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkark.dk/building.aspx?buildingid=2686|title=Kvartershuset|language=Danish|publisher=arkark|accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is extended with an assembly hall that is raised one storey above the ground on concrete pillers. The supporting structure in the hall is an exposed framework of plywood clad with glazing panels in pine frames.&lt;ref name=arkark/&gt;

==Facilities and activities==
Kvartershuset houses Sundby Library, a youth club, a café and various other facilities for the local community. It also arranges in-house and outdoor cultural events

'''Itelmen''' (autonym: ''itənmən''&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue, Michael. 2005. ''Comparative Chukotko–Kamchatkan Dictionary''. ''Trends in Linguistics'' 23. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;) or '''Western Itelmen''', formerly known as '''Western Kamchadal''', is a language of the [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan family]] spoken on the western coast of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. Fewer than a hundred native speakers, mostly elderly, in a few settlements in the southwest of [[Koryak Autonomous Okrug]], remained in 1993. The [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Census]] counted 3,180&amp;nbsp;ethnic [[Itelmens]], virtually all of whom are now monolingual in [[Russian language|Russian]]. However, there are attempts to [[language revival|revive]] the language, and it is being taught in a number of schools in the region.

(Western) Itelmen is the only surviving [[Kamchatkan languages|Kamchatkan language]]. It has two dialects, Sedanka and Xajrjuzovo (Ukä).

==History==
Originally the [[Kamchatkan languages]] were spoken throughout Kamchatka and possibly also in the northern [[Kuril Islands]]. [[Vladimir Atlasov]], who annexed Kamchatka and established military bases in the region, estimated in 1697 that there were about 20,000 ethnic Itelmens. The explorer [[Stepan Krasheninnikov]], who gave the first detailed description of the Itelmen language and culture, identified the three main dialects, but explained that all Itelmens could understand each other.

From the time of Atlasov, Russian fur traders began to settle in the region. There were frequent clashes between Cossacks and Itelmens, who rebelled against Russian domination. Many Itelmen were forcibly converted to [[Christianity]], and by the early nineteenth century all Itelmen were forced to adopt Russian names. Intermarriage with Russian settlers led to the development of a creole known as Kamchadal, traces of which remain in the Russian dialect now spoken in Kamchatka.

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era the process of assimilation intensified, as Itelmen communities were moved by force and children were sent to boarding schools where they were required to speak Russian. By the end of the 1930s Russian was the medium of instruction in all schools, and children grew up speaking Russian as their main language.

However it was also during this period that Itelmen was written down for the first time. In 1930, a Latin-based alphabet was designed for all the native languages of northern Siberia, and in 1932, a 27-letter Itelmen alphabet was created. A few textbooks were written in this alphabet during the 1930s, but it was quickly abandoned. More recently, a [[Cyrillic]]-based alphabet, designed in 1986 and consisting of 32 letters, has been used.

==Present situation==
Itelmen is now highly [[endangered language|endangered]], and most speakers are aged over sixty and live in scattered communities. However, there is a movement to revive the language, and educational materials are being developed. Modern Itelmen has been heavily influenced by Russian lexically, phonologically and grammatically.

==Phonology==
Itelmen has a larger phonological inventory than other Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages, and permits complex [[consonant cluster]]s in some environments. However, Itelmen has a different system of [[vowel harmony]] than its relatives [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]] and [[Koryak language|Koryak]].

[[Aleksandr Pavlovich Volodin|Volodin]] (1997) gives the following consonant inventory, shown here with both the [[Cyrillic]] and IPA forms. Itelmen is unusual in having a [[voice onset time|voicing]] (VOT) distinction in fricatives but not in plosives.&lt;ref&gt;One of the few other languages that does this, though without the ejectives, is the Hill dialect of [[Mari language|Mari]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the consonants shown above, some sources also include the glottal stop {{IPA|/ʔ/}}, as well as glottalised nasal and lateral phonemes, including {{IPA|/mˀ/}}, {{IPA|/nˀ/}}, and {{IPA|/lˀ/}}. 's' and 'z' may be apical post-alveolar fricatives rather than alveolar fricatives. There may also be distinct labialised consonant phonemes.

There are five vowel phonemes: {{IPA|/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/,}} and {{IPA|/u/}}. [[Schwa]] ({{IPA|[ə]}}) also appears but its phonemic status is unclear.

==Classification==
There are two points of view about where Itelmen belongs genetically. According to the first theory, Itelmen and [[Chukotkan languages]] derived from a common proto-language; the sharp differences of Itelmen, noticed at all levels, are explained by the intense influence of other languages; it is suggested that Itelmen absorbed a different non-Chukotko-Kamchatkan language.&lt;ref&gt;V. G. Bogoraz, V. I. Jochelson, P. Y. Skorik&lt;/ref&gt; According to the second theory, Itelmen is not related to other Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages; common elements are due to contact.&lt;ref&gt;D. Wort, A. P. Volodin, A. S. Asinovsky&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial comparisons of the basic Itelmen lexicon to Chukotkan show that only a third of the word stock is cognate. This result is preliminary due to the incompleteness of Chukotko-Kamchatkan comparative phonetics. Arends et al. (1995) state that Itelmen is a [[mixed language]], with Chukotkan morphology and a lexicon from a separate language,&lt;ref&gt;Arends, Muysken, &amp; Smith (1995), ''Pidgins and Creoles: An Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt; possibly related to [[Nivkh language|Gilyak]] or [[Wakashan]]. Itelmen would thus be a creole of a [[Luorawetlan]] language and [[Nivkh language|Gilyak]]/[[Wakashan]] just as [[Kamchadal]] became a creole of Itelmen and [[Russian language|Russian]]. However, Fortescue (2005) partially reconstructed the Chukotko-Kamchatkan proto-language. See [[Kamchatkan languages#Classification]].

==External influence on morphology==
There may be different answers given to the question of which elements of Itelmen are original and which have been brought about by contact with other languages. To take the second hypothesis, Itelmen was at the very beginning an agglutinative language, with word structure (m) + R + (m) (where R is a root and (m) one of several word-changing morphemes), it was nominal, compounds were prohibited; it preserves all of these elements into the present. A difference in reported material origin with Chukotko-[[Koryak language|Koryak]] languages in declensional and conjugational paradigms is the result of convergent development under conditions of a [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]] [[Sprachbund]]. Incorporation goes against word structure (not more than one root morpheme), thus Itelmen did not take it on. Reduplication of a root, inherent to all the languages of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan group, was able to develop in Itelmen apart from the influence of contact.

Russian borrowings in Itelmen already started to appear in the 17th century. Among the Russian words that were borrowed, in some cases replacing Itelmen words, adjectives and adverbs predominate and even preserve Russian morphology: ''vostr-oy'' sharp-&lt;small&gt;NOM.MASC.SG&lt;/small&gt;, ''krasn-oy'' red-&lt;small&gt;NOM.MASC.SG&lt;/small&gt;, ''sinny-oy'' blue-&lt;small&gt;NOM.MASC.SG&lt;/small&gt;, ''svez-oy'' fresh-&lt;small&gt;NOM.MASC.SG&lt;/small&gt;, etc. Borrowed verbs adapt in accordance with the demands of Itelmen morphology: Itel. ''stara'lkas'' (Rus. ''starat'sya'') means 'to try', Itel. ''otkaza'lkas'' (Rus. ''otkazyvat'sya'') 'to deny,' It. ''napraves'' means 'to cook food'. To speak of Russian borrowings in Itelmen today is hardly possible, because all Itelmens speak Russian much better than their native language.

==Syntax==
The Itelmen language is an agglutinative language, it has affixes for nouns and verbs, and most of its affixes are suffixes.

Its basic word order is [[subject–object–verb]], numerals and demonstratives are placed before the noun they modify, although adjectives can be placed before or after the noun they modify.&lt;ref&gt;http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_ite&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
Itelmen is not standardized and does not have a separate literary variety. A retelling of Itelmen mythology was written in Russian by Krasheninnikov. Folk language (only recordings from the 20th century survive, Western language) does not show special characteristics compared to the conversational language.

Writing based on Latin graphemes was introduced in 1932 (an alphabet book and arithmetic textbook were published). Teaching from the alphabet book of 1932 (authored by ethnographer Elizabeth Porfirevna Orlova and co-produced by a group of Itelmen students) lasted several years; but after alphabets for "Northern" languages were transformed into [[Cyrillic]] at the end of the 1930s, Itelmen writing was abolished. Itelmen became an unwritten language and remained that way for almost a half century.

The modern Itelmen alphabet was created in 1984 on a Cyrillic base and in 1988 was confirmed by the Russian Ministry of Education. A second Itelmen alphabet book was created in 1988. An Itelmen-Russian/Russian-Itelmen dictionary and second-grade textbook were also published. In 1993 the Itelmen alphabet book was republished. Itelmen has been taught as a subject in elementary grades, but teachers do not speak the language like the students. In 2002 a translation of the [[Gospel of Luke]] was published in Itelmen. All of these works are published in the Southern dialect.

A deepening sign (˚) and glottal stop sign (ʼ) are also used in instructional works. In the sequence of instructionally published signs Ă ă, Ŏ ŏ, Ў ў are not considered separate letters. Also, in many publications "Ԓ ԓ" and "Ӽ ӽ" are used in place of the letters "Ԯ ԯ (Ӆ ӆ)" and "Ҳ ҳ" (for example in the ''Historical Ethnographic Handbook of Itelmen'', Krasnodar, 2005).

The newspaper ''Native of Kamchatka'', which regularly publishes works in Itelmen, does not use the letters 'Ă ă, Ŏ ŏ, Ў ў but does use the deepening sign (˚).

'''John Sinclair''' is the name as well as the protagonist of a popular German horror detective fiction series (of the [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] or [[penny dreadful]] variety). Sinclair, a [[Scotland Yard]] chief inspector, battles all kinds of undead and demonic creatures. The series appears weekly and has been running since 1973. The full title is ''Geisterjäger John Sinclair'', ghosthunter John Sinclair. While falling into the category of 'pulp fiction', the ongoing series is yet remarkable for the relatively wide range of its vocabulary and the inventiveness of its plots.

Almost all John Sinclair stories in the series have been written exclusively by [[Helmut Rellergerd]] under the nom-de-plume of [[Jason Dark]]. Only a few of the earliest stories have been written by other authors. As of late, creation of new stories is divided among Rellergard and several new authors, each of them writing separate full episodes; the new writers are attributed for their respective stories. Over the decades the Spanish painter [[Vicenç Badalona Ballestar]] has created numerous paintings and illustrations for the bestselling series.

Rellergerd narrates the stories in first person from Sinclair's point of view whenever he is involved. At all other times a neutral narrator style is used. In some stories Sinclair does not appear and one of his friends takes the leading part.

==Characters==

===Heroes===
*'''John Sinclair''' is of Scottish descent and the reborn soul of both King Solomon and Knight Templar Hector de Valois. He is a direct descendant of [[Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney]]. John Sinclair is described as 1.90m tall and blond in his middle thirties. Like most characters he does not age during the course of the series. He is called the Son of the Light and wields an extremely blessed cross as well as a Beretta handgun with silver bullets. He has acquired and lost other weapons during the series.&lt;br&gt;Sinclair is a bachelor, never really having a girlfriend during the series. The one time he did fall in love, his fiance turned out to be a trap set by his enemies.
*'''Suko''' is Sinclair's colleague as a Scotland Yard inspector. He is a Chinese proficient in martial arts. As an additional weapon, he carries a whip made from the skin of demon which instantly kills all undead or demonic beings except the strongest. He has no first name, being called just Suko or Inspector Suko.&lt;br&gt;Suko was brought up in a Shaolin temple somewhere in China where he learned his martial arts and discipline. Originally the driver of a powerful Chinese patron in London, he joined Sinclair after his patron and the latter's sole daughter were killed by a dragon-worshipping cult.
*'''Sir James Powell''' is the direct superior of Sinclair and Suko. He rarely gets involved directly into the action, mostly giving information and valuable support and cover from his office. Sir James can arrange a lot of things due to his status in society and his connections. He has complete confidence in his team.
*'''Glenda Perkins''' is the office secretary, especially famous for her coffee. She has served as one of several love-interests of Sinclair. During 2006 she was injected with a nano-tech serum enabling her to teleport. At first she could not control her teleport ability, but recently she has begun to master it quite well and is even capable of taking one or two persons with her.
*'''Shao''' is Suko's permanent girlfriend. She is Japanese and the reincarnation of the Japanese Goddess [[Amaterasu]], also known as the Phantom with the Crossbow.
*'''Bill Conolly''' is a close personal friend of Sinclair's. They have studied together and been friends ever since. Bill is a freelance investigative reporter and sometimes gets involved in Sinclair's cases. He married early in the series.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Geisterjäger John Sinclair 5, Sakurro der Dämon.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Sheila Conolly''', née Sheila Hopkins, is the wife of Bill Conolly. Her father was a rich industrialist killed by the demon Sakurro.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*'''Johnny Conolly''' is the only child of Sheila and Bill Conolly, and John Sinclair's godson. He is the only character to age during the series, growing up into a good-looking young man currently attending the University of London. Johnny Conolly occasionally gets involved in Sinclair's cases, much to the dismay of his mother.
*'''Jane Collins''' is a former witch who switched sides during the course of the series. When an agent of Asmodis cut out her heart, she had to have an artificial heart. Collins works as a successful private detective, only occasionally appearing in the series. After the death of Lady Sarah Goodwin, she inherited her Mayfair home and other possessions.
*'''Lady Sarah Goldwyn''', also called the Horror-Grandma, was a collector of horror books and films as well as antiquarian volumes on magic and the supernatural, making her an expert in the field. She took Jane Collins into her Mayfair home, bequeathing it to her when she was killed by the monster vampires of the Black Death.

===Recurring villains===
Most bad guys are destroyed by the end of a novel, but some arch-villains come up quite often against Sinclair until he finds a way to get rid of them permanently. Due to the horror nature of most of the creatures, some return even after being destroyed, most notably '''Vincent van Akkeren''' who started mortal and had to be killed 3 times by powers of the light before he stayed dead.
*'''Doctor Tod''' ("Doctor Death") was the first recurring villain. He committed suicide after a lost battle with John Sinclair. Asmodina and the Spook transferred his soul into the body of Mafia godfather Solo Morasso. Sinclair kills him in a later battle.
*'''Asmodina''' was the daughter of the devil '''Asmodis'''. Her original shape was Apep, the hell snake. However, her preferred appearance was that of a young, beautiful red headed woman with horns growing out of her forehead. During the series, she commanded Doctor Tod and his killer league. Later, Doctor Tod wanted to be independent and made a deal with the Spook to kill Asmodina. He managed to do so by taking ownership of Sinclair's silver Boomerang and beheaded her in Spook's realm.
*'''Der Schwarze Tod''' ("The Black Death") is another major demon and one of John's enemies. He is defeated in the episode "Das letzte Duell"
*'''Will Mallmann''': Formerly one of Sinclair's best friends and allies, he was a [[commissioner]] in the ''[[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Bundeskriminalamt]]'', the German Federal Criminal Police Office. During a vampire hunt, however, he was captured by vampires, fatally wounded and forced to drink a distillant from [[Count Dracula]]'s blood, turning him into both a [[vampire]] and Dracula's heir (he bears the official name of "'''Dracula II'''"). Will has since plagued his former friend time and again with his scheme to turn the world into a vampire realm. A magical item, the Bloodstone, also makes him immune to any conventional means of destroying vampires.&lt;ref&gt;Geisterjäger John Sinclair 569 "Teufel im Leib"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weapons and special items===
*Sinclair's weapon of choice is his '''blessed Silver Cross''', inscribed with the initials of the four [[archangel]]s [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]] and [[Uriel (archangel)|Uriel]]. This cross is able to take out any but the most powerful of demons. Being fashioned in biblical times by the prophet [[Ezekiel]], it was bequeathed to John Sinclair by divine powers, making him the "Son of Light".&lt;br&gt;The Cross violently attacks any evil force it comes into contact with while protecting any good creature. It is a very powerful artifact whose powers are not yet completely understood by Sinclair. He can further activate the cross with the spell 'Terra pestem teneto, salus hic maneto' turning it into an even more powerful area effect weapon.
*Several characters, mostly Sinclair, Suko, Bill Conolly and Jane Collins, carry a [[Beretta]] pistol armed with [[silver bullet]]s. These bullets are blessed by a Catholic abbot and can vanquish most weaker undead or demonic creatures on impact. Against vampires, air-powered pistols firing wooden darts are also used.
*'''Suko's demon-hide whip''' is made from the skin of a defeated demon. It is more powerful than the silver bullets but less than the silver cross. Suko is an expert at wielding the whip and can take out most creatures with one hit.

===Religion===
Rellergerd never states exactly which Christian denomination John Sinclair or any of his team is a member of. The silver bullets are made by a Catholic abbot, even though most of the team probably belong to a Protestant variant of Christianity. Suko and Shao are Buddhists.

===Critical assessment===

There has been some scholarly engagement with the Sinclair novels of Jason Dark, particularly as regards their author's powers of imagination and inventiveness, and a positive assessment has on occasion been expressed. Tony Page comments:

"Jason Dark’s imaginative powers have rightly been
praised. Indeed, Godden writes: ‘As regards imagination,
Jason Dark towers houses high in superiority above Sherlock
Holmes creator, Conan Doyle.’ (Godden, 207: 293). This is
eminent praise indeed-and is justly bestowed. The sheer
inexhaustible inventiveness which Dark displays week upon
week, in novel after novel, is testimony to a fertility of
imagination which can rightly lay claim to lie within the
realm of genius."&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Tony Page, ''Jason Dark: German Pulp Fiction Writer of Genius'', Bangkok University 2010 http://www.bu.ac.th/knowledgecenter/executive_journal/july_sep_10/pdf/aw33.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3123">'''Kosher tourism''' is tourism which is geared towards mostly Orthodox Jews. The accommodations in these destinations include [[Kosher food|kosher foods]] and are within walking distance of synagogues. Flights to these destinations often have [[kosher airline meal]]s available.

==Holiday travel==
Many kosher vacation packages are geared toward the Jewish holidays throughout the year including [[Passover]], [[Sukkot]] and [[Hanukkah]]. In Israel, schools are on vacation and parents take advantage of the free time to travel within the country or overseas. [[Yeshiva]]s in other parts of the world also have a vacation period during these holidays known as [[Bein Hazmanim]].

===Passover===
A seasonal subcategory of the Kosher tourism industry is travel for Passover, a period of a week that otherwise involves special preparation of the personal home and kitchen. It includes specially designed all-inclusive Passover cruises&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/2893/cruises-gearing-up-for-passover-with-rabbis-matzah-seder-menus/ |title=Cruises gearing up for Passover with rabbis, matzah, seder menus |date=March 29, 1996 |access-date=December 13, 2011 |last=Staub |first=Molly |work=[[j.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vosizneias.com/52271/2010/03/29/florida-for-passover-mass-exodus-from-ny-israel-to-miami-beach/ |title=Florida - For Passover Mass Exodus from NY, Israel to Miami Beach |date=August 11, 2010 |access-date=December 13, 2011 |work=[[The Miami Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sukkot===
The week-long holiday of Sukkot involves the need to eat meals and sleep in a [[sukkah]] which destinations and locations wishing to attract observant Jews will build, either for eating only, or overnight use as well.

===Hanukkah===
During the holiday of Hanukkah, places such as [[Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut|Modi'in]] are popular for those who want to see the historical sites where many of the events leading up to the [[Maccabees|Maccabean Revolt]] took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/content/module/2011/12/28/main-feature/1/urban-planning-hasmonean-style/ |title=Urban Planning, Hasmonean-Style |date=December 28, 2011 |access-date=December 28, 2011 |last=Fischer |first=Elli |work=[[Jewish Ideas Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haredi tourism==
Another subcategory of the Kosher tourism industry is tourism products geared toward the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] community. This segment of the Kosher tourism industry has a potential customer base of about 800,000 households. Important aspects of this segment of the industry include separate hours for men and women at swimming pools and beaches and the hotels might remove televisions or Internet access from rooms and the lobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/1,7340,L-3477476,00.html |title=Glatt-kosher vacations |date=December 1, 2007 |access-date=December 13, 2011 |last=Crystal |first=Michal |work=[[Ynet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since her rise to fame in the 1940s, American film actress [[Lana Turner]] (1921{{spaced en dash}}1995) has appeared and been referenced in numerous works across literature, film, art, and music. Her [[glamour (presentation)|glamorous]] persona and publicized personal troubles have contributed to her recurring prevalence in [[popular culture]].{{sfn|Morella|Epstein|1971|pages=40–41}}{{sfn|Fields|2007|p=109}}{{sfn|Basinger|2008|p=182}} 

Turner first entered the popular culture lexicon under the nickname "the [[Sweater girl|Sweater Girl]]" due to her feature film debut in ''[[They Won't Forget]]'' (1937), in which she appeared in a form-fitting sweater that accentuated her bust. She was the first known person to be given the nickname, which went on to be applied to numerous actresses throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Her subsequent rise to fame at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and establishment as a [[sex symbol]] enhanced Turner's profile, and she became a popular [[pin-up model]] throughout [[World War II]]. 

While she enjoyed significant popularity as one of MGM's biggest stars, she was also subject to vociferous media attention over her numerous romantic affairs, eight total marriages, and her daughter's [[Lana Turner#Johnny Stompanato homicide|1958 killing]] of Turner's lover, [[Johnny Stompanato]], during a domestic struggle. The media focus on her storied personal life (particularly the Stompanato homicide) contributed to her cultural prevalence at the time, even sometimes serving as the basis for novels and films.

In her later career and after her death, Turner would go on to appear depicted in numerous artistic works, as well as be studied by social critics and academics in discussions surrounding Hollywood, [[film theory]], [[gay icon]]s, and [[Camp (style)|camp aesthetics]].  

==Timeline==
===20th century===
====Discovery story====
The story of Turner's chance discovery by [[William R. Wilkerson|William Wilkerson]] at a Hollywood [[Soda shop|malt shop]] at age 16 was widely circulated during her lifetime, and went on to become a part of Hollywood mythology.{{sfn|Basinger|1976|p=27}}&lt;ref name=wr&gt;{{cite web|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-01/entertainment/ca-19119_1_lana-turner|title=Writing the End to a True-to-Life Cinderella Story|author=Wilkerson, W.R. III|date=July 1, 1995|accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varied accounts as to where the discovery occurred were recounted in publication and via [[word of mouth]] during her early career in the late 1930s and early 1940s, with a popular retelling having the meeting occur at [[Schwab's Pharmacy]].{{sfn|Basinger|1976|pages=27–30}}{{sfn|Fields|2007|p=79}} Shortly after Turner's rise to fame, the owner of the malt shop in which the discovery took place erected a metal plaque on the seat which Turner had occupied when she met Wilkerson, and soon the shop became inundated with young women hoping to experience the same chance occurrence.&lt;ref name=wr/&gt; Wilkerson's son, journalist William Wilkerson III, wrote on the lasting cultural impact of Turner's discovery in 1995: 

{{quote|On that January day, a Hollywood myth sprang to life. In one brief, glittering moment, a schoolgirl was plucked from a soda fountain counter and catapulted into the eternal firmament of stardom. But, curiously, while Hollywood's history is littered with dozens of noteworthy discovery stories, this one stuck. Lana's much quoted "discovery" became one of the town's most enduring legends. It became famous as "the Hollywood Cinderella Story" because it combined a young girl, [[Cinderella]]; a powerful publisher, the handsome prince; and a letter to agent [[Zeppo Marx]], the glass slipper that transformed her life.&lt;ref name=wr/&gt;}}

Scholar Kim Fields similarly wrote about the lasting cultural relevance of Turner and her discovery story in her 2007 book ''An Intimate Affair: Women, Lingerie, and Sexuality'', noting that it is emblematic of "the [[American Dream]] fulfilled&amp;nbsp;... Because of her, being discovered at a soda fountain has become almost as cherished an ideal as being [[Log cabin#Symbolism|born in a log cabin]]."{{sfn|Fields|2007|p=109}}

===="The Sweater Girl"====
Following her feature film debut in [[Mervyn LeRoy]]'s ''[[They Won't Forget]]'' (1937), Turner was the first woman to receive the nickname the "[[Sweater girl|Sweater Girl]]" due to her form-fitting attire which accentuated her bust.{{sfn|Busch|1940|p=64}}{{Sfn|Fischer|1991|p=187}} Though she herself detested the nickname, it was one with which she became synonymous over the duration of her career,{{sfn|Langer|2001|loc=event occurs at 6:40}} and it would come to be applied to several actresses throughout the 1940s and 1950s.{{sfn|Fraterrigo|2011|p=229}} Several years after the release of ''They Won't Forget'', ''[[Modern Screen]]'' journalist Nancy Squires wrote an extensive article on Turner, in which she noted that she had "made a sweater look like something [[Cleopatra]] was saving for the next visiting [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]."&lt;ref name=squire&gt;{{cite magazine|work=[[Modern Screen]]|issn=0026-8429|title=The Strange Case of Lana Turner|url=https://archive.org/stream/modernscreen26unse#page/n553/|p=32|date=May 1943|via=Internet Archive|author=Squire, Nancy Winslow}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Turner's rise to fame and establishment as a Hollywood [[sex symbol]]{{sfn|Morella|Epstein|1971|pages=24–25}} following ''They Won't Forget'' was concurrent with [[World War II]], and she became a prominent [[pin-up model]] at the time, appearing painted on the noses of U.S. fighter planes bearing the title "Tempest Turner."{{sfn|Langer|2001|loc=event occurs at 33:33}} MGM appointed her to tour the United States [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and sell [[war bonds]] in various cities in the summer of 1942.&lt;ref name=pittsburghkiss&gt;{{cite news|work=The Pittsburgh Press|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|title=Lana's Kisses Sell Bonds Without Her Fancy Speech|p=1|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21981391/the_pittsburgh_press/|via=Newspapers.com|date=June 25, 1942}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the tour, Turner began giving out kisses to the highest buyers, and by the end of the 10-week tour, had sold $5.25 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|5.25|1942|r=1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) in war bonds.&lt;ref name=pittsburghkiss/&gt;

====Depictions in art====
[[File:Lana Turner and Frank Sinatra, 1944.png|thumb|upright|left|Turner with [[Frank Sinatra]] {{circa|1944}}]]
One of the earliest [[popular culture]] references to Turner is in [[Frank Sinatra]]'s 1944 recorded version of  "[[Nancy (with the Laughing Face)]]."{{sfn|Ingham|2005|p=138}} During this time, Turner and Sinatra had been carrying on a romantic affair.{{sfn|Langer|2001|loc=event occurs at 32:44}} She would later be named in [[Nina Simone]]'s 1958 version of the song "[[My Baby Just Cares for Me]]," which appeared on her album ''[[Little Girl Blue (album)|Little Girl Blue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The A.V.

In 1962, writer [[Harold Robbins]] published the novel ''[[Where Love Has Gone (novel)|Where Love Has Gone]]'', which was inspired by the scandal surrounding Turner after her daughter, [[Cheryl Crane]], stabbed her lover, [[Johnny Stompanato]], to death during a domestic struggle in their Beverly Hills home.{{sfn|Erickson|2017|p=119}} A [[Where Love Has Gone (film)|film adaptation]] of the novel was made in 1964.{{sfn|Erickson|2017|p=119}} In response to the release of the novel and film, Turner told a journalist: "I suppose I'll be getting bugged by that question."{{sfn|Erickson|2017|p=119}} The same year, poet [[Frank O'Hara]] wrote the poem "Lana Turner has collapsed" (1964), which was based on a headline he had seen stating that Turner had collapsed at a social gathering.{{sfn|Sutherland|Fender|2011|p=54}} 

In 1985, artist [[Andy Warhol]] produced a silkscreen print of Turner in her youth,{{sfn|Heinrich|Breitz|1999|p=165}} and she was photographed by Warhol in [[Polaroid film|Polaroid]] the same year; one Polaroid image from the shoot would later sell in auction for $3,750.&lt;ref name=polaroid&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/andy-warhol-christies/lana-turner-107/203|work=[[Christie's]]|title=Lana Turner, ANDY WARHOL|accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[James Ellroy]] depicted Turner again (alongside Stompanato) in his 1990 novel ''[[L.A. Confidential]]'' (1990).{{sfn|Dargis|2003|p=33}} [[Brenda Bakke]] went on to portray her in a scene of the [[L.A. Confidential (film)|1995 film adaptation]] by director [[Curtis Hanson]].{{sfn|Brook|2013|p=148}} Also in 1990, Turner was referenced on the rap section of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna's]] [[Vogue (Madonna song)|"Vogue"]] next to stars from the Golden Age era of Hollywood such as [[Rita Hayworth]], [[Lauren Bacall]], and [[Marilyn Monroe]].{{Sfn|Raha|2008|p=103}} Despite her recurring prevalence in popular culture, upon her death in 1995, writer and critic [[John Updike]] wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that Turner "was a faded period piece, an old-fashioned glamour queen whose fifty-four films, over four decades didn't amount, retrospectively to much&amp;nbsp;... As a performer, she was purely a studio-made product."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New Yorker]]|author=Updike, John|author-link=John Updike|title=Legendary Lana|date=February 12, 1996|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/02/12/legendary-lana|p=68|issn=0028-792X|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
===21st century===
In 2002, Turner was commemorated by artist Eloy Torrez in an outdoor [[mural]], ''Portrait of Hollywood'', painted on the auditorium of [[Hollywood High School]], her alma mater, alongside numerous other famous alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hhsalumnicommunity.ning.com/page/the-hhs-auditorium-mural|work=Hollywood High School Alumni Association|author=Garcia, Mark|title=The HHS Auditorium Mural|accessdate=May 24, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180524040527/http://hhsalumnicommunity.ning.com/page/the-hhs-auditorium-mural|archivedate=May 24, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; American singer-songwriter Elizabeth Grant ({{abbr|b.|born}} 1985), better known as [[Lana Del Rey]], devised her stage name inspired by Turner and the [[Ford Del Rey]] sedan.&lt;ref name=petrusich&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/lana-del-rey-is-exhausted |work=[[The New Yorker]] |title=Lana Del Rey Is Exhausted |date=September 29, 2015 |author=Petrusich, Amanda |archivedate=April 30, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430175215/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/lana-del-rey-is-exhausted |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/music/sd-et-music-lana-delrey-20180214-story.html|location=San Diego, California|work=The San Diego Union Tribune|title=Lana Del Rey has legs, a stalker, four Grammy nominations and a possible Broadway musical|date=February 14, 2018|author=Varga, George|accessdate=May 24, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/Fb9MQ|archivedate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 article on Del Rey in ''The New Yorker'' described Turner as a "titan of red-lip, Old Hollywood glamour."&lt;ref name=petrusich/&gt;

==As gay icon==
[[File:Límitation of Life- Lana's First Modeling Gig (8634048811).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Turner portrayed in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] in a 2013 a Chicago production of ''Límitation of Life'', based on ''[[Imitation of Life (1959 film)|Imitation of Life]]'' (1959)]]
Beginning in the 1970s, it was observed by journalist [[Sally Quinn]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that Turner had accumulated a following of [[Gay male culture|gay men]],&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|author-link=Sally Quinn|author=Quinn, Sally|title=Gay times generate a new following for Lana Turner|p=17|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22243729/the_boston_globe/|via=Newspapers.com|date=April 22, 1975}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to her contemporaries [[Judy Garland]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Bette Davis]], and others.{{sfn|Benshoff|Griffin|2006|p=69}} One attendee at a 1975 gala celebrating her career told Quinn: "She represents&amp;nbsp;... homosexuals' fantasies at a certain age in their lives. They identify with her and she's a survivor. It's like their saying, 'Let's go see how she's survived.'"&lt;ref name=globe/&gt; Subsequent associations with Turner as a [[gay icon]] have centered on her personal struggles and triumphs, as well as her glamorous persona and the perceived [[Camp (style)|camp]] aesthetics of several of her films.{{sfn|Guilbert|2018|pages=176–177}} Scholars such as [[Susan Sontag]] noted the camp qualities of such films as ''[[The Prodigal (film)|The Prodigal]]'' (1955),{{sfn|Sontag|1966|p=286}} a Biblical costume drama in which Turner portrayed a pagan temptress.{{sfn|Parish|Bowers|1973|p=777}}{{sfn|Morella|Epstein|1971|p=155}}

[[File:Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice - publicity portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Turner in ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (1946)]]
Scholar [[Georges Claude Guilbert|Georges-Claude Guilbert]] notes Turner's impact as a gay icon as far back as her appearance ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (1946): "[Upon the release of ''[[Imitation of Life (1959 film)|Imitation of Life]]'',] Turner's gay iconocity quotient had already reached a very high level 12 years previously with the release of ''The Postman Always Rings Twice'' Even 70 years later one never comes out unscathed from a viewing. The head wrap! The shoes! The shorts! That movie is a lesson in style and in it, Turner is a lesson in stylishness."{{sfn|Guilbert|2018|p=177}} Additionally, Guilbert notes Turner's personal scandals (such as the 1958 Stompanato killing), frequent romances and eight-total marriages as additional factors in her consideration as a gay icon.{{sfn|Guilbert|2018|p=177}} Scholar Robin Griffiths also considers Turner a "camp icon" due to her "alternately deadpan and overblown performances."{{sfn|Griffiths|2008|p=89}} Author Sam Staggs noted of Turner in ''Imitation of Life'': {{quote|To Hollywood, Lana ''was'' her tight sweater. To [[Ross Hunter]], a closeted gay man unaroused by female flesh, Lana without the sweater meant the opportunity to dress her up in two dozen stunning outfits, like a live [[Barbie]] doll. Even that famous sweater, in its day, had symbolized a certain kind of heterosexual camp, redolent of locker rooms, and [[burlesque]]. Hunter, hugely abetted by [[Douglas Sirk]], created an entirely new goddess, a Lana Turner who, like [[Myra Breckinridge]], embodies heterosexual and homosexual camp while remaining oddly sexless.{{sfn|Staggs|2009|p=76}}}}

The '''''Left Behind'' film series''' is based on the [[Left Behind]] best-selling book series by [[Tim LaHaye]] and [[Jerry B. Jenkins]]. The films were produced by [[Cloud Ten Pictures]] and directed by [[Vic Sarin]] (''[[Left Behind: The Movie]]''), Bill Corcoran (''[[Left Behind II: Tribulation Force]]''), and [[Craig R. Baxley]] (''[[Left Behind: World at War]]''). [[Kirk Cameron]] stars as Buck Williams, along with [[Brad Johnson (actor, born 1959)|Brad Johnson]], [[Janaya Stephens]], [[Clarence Gilyard, Jr.]], [[Gordon Currie]], [[Chelsea Noble]], [[Colin Fox (actor)|Colin Fox]], and [[Academy Award]] winner [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]]

At the time of its release, ''Left Behind: The Movie'' was the most expensive [[Christian film industry|Christian film]] ever made. It received mostly negative reviews from [[Film critic|critics]] and had a mediocre [[box office]] run. All three films were [[Criticism|criticized]] for their low production quality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1052">The '''Leonardo da Vinci Award''' was established in 1975 by the [[Rotary Club]] of [[Florence]] as an annual international prize named after [[Leonardo da Vinci]], to be presented to young people involved in the study of the sciences, technology, literature and the arts. Among the disciplines recognised and rewarded so far have been [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[geology]], [[architecture]], [[medicine]] and [[nuclear physics]]. The 21st Leonardo da Vinci Prize was recently presented to the brilliant young pianist Johan Schmidt. The prize giving event has been hosted by other European Rotary Clubs in cities such as [[Tours]], [[Vienna]], [[Athens]], [[Madrid]], [[Würzburg]], [[Brussels]] and [[Amsterdam]].  This event was last held in [[London]] in 1987, when the prize was awarded to the internationally recognised percussionist [[Evelyn Glennie]]. In 1996 1/2 the Rotary Club of London will again be responsible for hosting the prize-giving ceremony.

The '''''Linguistic Atlas of Chinese Dialects''''' ({{zh|s=汉语方言地图集|p=Hànyǔ Fāngyán Dìtú Jí}}), edited by [[Cao Zhiyun]] and published in 2008 in three volumes, is a [[dialect atlas]] documenting the geography of [[varieties of Chinese]]. Unlike the ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987), which maps the distribution of both minority languages and Chinese dialect groups, the new atlas is a collection of [[map]]s of various features of dialects, in the tradition of the ''[[Atlas linguistique de la France]]'' and its successors.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|p=57}}{{sfnp|Iwata|2010|pp=100–101}}

== Methods ==
[[File:Map of sinitic languages full-en.svg|thumb|upright=2|Top-level groups of Chinese varieties identified in the ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'', used in the selection of survey sites for the dialect atlas]]
The project spanned 8 years, from 2001 to 2007.
A year of preparatory work began in December 2001, including selecting survey sites, codifying fieldwork procedures and conducting trial surveys.{{sfnp|Cao|2008|p=2}}{{sfnp|Cao|Liu|2012|p=142}}

The 930 sites throughout China and Taiwan were selected so that there was usually one site per county in southeast China and one site in every three or four counties in the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Jin Chinese|Jin]] areas, preferably in non-contiguous counties.{{sfnp|Cao|Liu|2012|pp=143–144}}
Thus, for example, there were 92 sites each in [[Guangdong]] and [[Hubei]], but only 19 in [[Sichuan]] and 21 in [[Shaanxi]].{{sfnp|Cao|2008|p=4}}
The metropolitan district of each of 36 cities – provincial capitals plus [[Suzhou]], [[Xiamen]] and [[Meizhou]] – was included as a survey site.
The remaining 894 sites were generally chosen to be representative of rural dialects of their county, so dialect islands were omitted.{{sfnp|Cao|Liu|2012|p=144}}

A questionnaire was compiled, to elicit the pronunciation of 425 characters representing common Chinese morphemes, the local term for 470 items and the local form of 110 grammatical forms.{{sfnp|Cao|Liu|2012|p=145}}
Of the 930 sites selected, 91 sites were identified as key sites representing various dialect subgroups, to be subject to additional surveys.{{sfnp|Cao|Liu|2012|p=144}}
At these sites [[tone sandhi]] phenomena were to be investigated, and a much longer character list would be used.{{sfnp|Cao|Liu|2012|p=145}}

Fieldwork was conducted between December 2002 and December 2006, and the resulting data entered into a [[geographic information system]].{{sfnp|Cao|2008|p=2}}{{sfnp|Cao|Liu|2012|p=142}}
The 46 fieldworkers, 34 of whom held doctoral degrees in Chinese dialectology, were assigned to areas they were already familiar with.{{sfnp|Cao|Liu|2012|p=145}}
A single informant was used from each site, typically a male born between 1931 and 1945 who had spent almost all of his life at the site.{{sfnp|Cao|Liu|2012|p=144}}
This was in line with the usual practice in [[dialect geography]] elsewhere in the world of using nonmobile, older, rural males (NORMs), as such informants are considered more likely to reflect the traditional speech of the area.{{sfnp|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|pp=29–30}}

The maps were compiled and collated throughout 2007.{{sfnp|Cao|2008|p=3}}{{sfnp|Cao|Liu|2012|p=143}}

== Contents ==
The finished work consists of 510 maps, each containing data for all 930 sites, in three volumes:{{sfnp|Cao|2008|pp=6–7}}{{sfnp|Cao|Liu|2012|p=146}}
# ''Yǔyīn juǎn'' 语音卷 [Phonetics] (205 maps), {{ISBN|978-7-100-05774-5}}. These maps trace various significant [[phonetics|phonetic]] developments from earlier forms of Chinese, such as the development of the [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]] categories, [[voice (phonetics)|voice]]d initial [[obstruent]]s, initial consonants in [[palatal consonant|palatal]] environments and consonantal codas.{{sfnp|Cao|Liu|2012|pp=146–147}}
# ''Cíhuì juǎn'' 词汇卷 [Lexicon] (203 maps), {{ISBN|978-7-100-05784-4}}. Most of the [[lexicon]] maps show the particular expression used at each site for a given concept, displayed as [[Chinese characters]] standing for cognate morphemes.{{sfnp|Cao|Liu|2012|pp=147–148}}
# ''Yǔfǎ juǎn'' 语法卷, [Grammar] (102 maps), {{ISBN|978-7-100-05785-1}}. The [[grammar]] maps show the distribution of different syntactic constructions or grammatical morphemes.{{sfnp|Cao|Liu|2012|pp=148–149}}
In each map of the atlas, the different forms are classified, but the classifications are not explained, and must be deduced by the reader.{{sfnp|Iwata|2010|p=101}}
A digital version of the atlas is in preparation, to include additional maps and the full survey data.{{sfnp|Cao|Liu|2012|p=150}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2185">{{Culture of Djibouti}}
The '''literature of [[Djibouti]]''' has a longstanding poetic tradition. Several well-developed Somali forms of verse include the ''gabay'', ''jiifto'', ''geeraar'', ''wiglo'', ''buraanbur'', ''beercade'', ''afarey'' and ''guuraw''. The gabay (epic poem) has the most complex length and meter, often exceeding 100 lines. It is considered the mark of poetic attainment when a young poet is able to compose such verse, and is considered the height of poetry. Groups of memorizers and reciters (''hafidayaal'') traditionally propagated the well-developed art form. Poems revolve around several main themes, including ''baroorodiiq'' (elegy), ''amaan'' (praise), ''jacayl'' (romance), ''guhaadin'' (diatribe), ''digasho'' (gloating) and ''guubaabo'' (guidance). The baroorodiiq is composed to commemorate the death of a prominent poet or figure.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi75&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, ''Culture and Customs of Somalia'', (Greenwood Press: 2001), p.75-76&lt;/ref&gt; The Afar are familiar with the ''ginnili'', a kind of warrior-poet and diviner, and have a rich oral tradition of folk stories. They also have an extensive repertoire of battle songs.&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;Matt Phillips, Jean-Bernard Carillet, ''Lonely Planet Ethiopia and Eritrea'', (Lonely Planet: 2006), p.301.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Djibouti has a long tradition of [[Islam]]ic literature. Among the most prominent such historical works is the medieval ''Futuh Al-Habash'' by Shihāb al-Dīn, which chronicles the [[Adal Sultanate]] army's [[Ethiopian-Adal War|conquest of Abyssinia]] during the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Shihab"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shihāb al-Dīn Aḥmad ibn ʻAbd al-Qādir ʻArabfaqīh|first=Translated by Paul Stenhouse, Richard Pankhurst|title=The conquest of Abyssinia: 16th century|year=2003|publisher=Tsehai Publishers &amp; Distributors|pages=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgIwAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, a number of politicians and intellectuals have also penned memoirs or reflections on the country.

'''LifeArc, the new name for Medical Research Council Technology (MRC Technology, MRCT)''' is a British [[Medical_research|life science medical research]] charity. It was established in 2000 to [[Translational research|translate]] the work of [[Medical Research Council (UK)|UK Medical Research Council]] research scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Feldman, Corinna Lotz, ''A world to win: a rough guide to a future without global capitalism'', 2004, Lupus Books, {{ISBN|0952345412}}, 9780952345411&lt;/ref&gt;

Today LifeArc provides [[intellectual property]] identification, protection and commercialisation, technology development, early stage [[drug discovery]] and [[Humanized antibody|antibody humanization]] services for the MRC, academia, biotechnology and pharmaceutical organisations and charities, aiming to move promising medical research forward into viable and accessible patient treatments. &lt;ref name="Researcharticle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.research-europe.com/index.php/2011/08/dave-tapolczay-ceo-of-medical-research-council-technology/|title=CEO of MRC Technology |publisher=Research Europe |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Profits from LifeArc's activities are reinvested into further research. 


== History ==

MRC Technology started as the Medical Research Council Liaison Office in 1984, and in 1986 the MRC Collaborative Centre, a laboratory-based technology transfer function, was founded. In 1993, the Liaison Office became MRC's Technology Transfer Group, responsible for office based patenting and licensing.

MRC Technology was set up as a charity and a company limited by guarantee in 2000 to incorporate patenting, licensing and research functions.&lt;ref name="MRCTrole"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/other/0118404881/0118404881.pdf |title=A Review of UK Health Funding |publisher=The Stationery Office |author=Sir David Cooksey |date=2006-01-12 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [https://www.lifearc.org/lifearc-set-transform-medical-research-landscape/ 15 June 2017] it  officially became LifeArc.

== Activities ==

LifeArc has humanised a number of antibodies on behalf of other organisations. Four of these, [[Natalizumab|Tysabri (Biogen Idec/Elan)]], [[Tocilizumab|Actemra (Hoffmann-La Roche/Chugai)]], [[Vedolizumab|Entyvio (Millenium Pharma/Takeda)]] and [[Pembrolizumab|Keytruda (Merck/MSD)]], are now on the market.&lt;ref name="MRCLMB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/achievements/therapeutic-antibodies |title=Therapeutic Antibodies and the LMB |publisher=MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology |accessdate=2012-02-17 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, LifeArc signed a deal with the drug company [[AstraZeneca]] to share chemical compounds to help identify potential treatments for serious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wigglesworth, Terry Wood, eds, ''Management of Chemical and Biological Samples for Screening Applications'', 2012, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|3527645276}}, 9783527645275, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hd6HRB4AWf8C&amp;pg=PA390&amp;dq google books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MRCTAZ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrazeneca.com/Media/Press-releases/Article/AstraZeneca-and-MRC-Technology-Form-Strategic-Alliance |title=AstraZeneca and MRC Technology Form Strategic Alliance in Discovery Research, Utilising Shared Compound Libraries |publisher=AstraZeneca |accessdate=2013-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LifeArc is a member of a Global Drug Discovery Alliance along with [[Centre for Drug Research and Development|the Centre for Drug Research and Development]], [[Scripps Research Institute|the Scripps Research Institute]], Cancer Research Technology, the Lead Discovery Centre and the Centre for Drug Design and Discovery, dedicated to translating health research into new medicines and working together to improve the conversion of global early-stage research into much-needed new therapies.&lt;ref name="SciBX"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=SciBX (Science-Business Exchange) |year=2013 |volume=6 |issue=4 |title=Translational Globetrotting |author=Edelson, Steve |doi=10.1038/scibx.2013.78 |url=http://www.nature.com/scibx/journal/v6/n4/full/scibx.2013.78.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Maniapoto was born in [[Invercargill]], New Zealand&lt;ref name=artsFoundation&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arts Foundation : Moana Maniapoto – Biography|url=https://www.thearts.co.nz/artist_page.php&amp;aid=32&amp;type=bio|publisher=The Arts Foundation|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and attended [[St Joseph's Māori Girls' College]] in Napier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10473865&amp;pnum=0|title=Singing the same song|last=Bridgeman|first=Shelley |date=4 November 2007|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is said to have paid her way through law school by singing covers in the highly competitive [[Auckland]] club circuit.&lt;ref name=artsFoundation /&gt;

In 1987, Moana released "Kua Makona", as part of an effort to promote moderation to young Maori. The song was produced by [[Maui Dalvanius Prime]] and featured in the [[RIANZ]] Top 50 singles chart.

Moana was briefly married to New Zealand politician and radio personality [[Willie Jackson (politician)|Willie Jackson]], during which time she was known as Moana Maniapoto-Jackson; they divorced in 2001.

In 2002, Moana formed the band [[Moana and the Tribe]] which consisted of a large group of musicians and performers with a passion for [[Maori culture]]. Since their formation, the band has performed hundreds of  international concerts, cementing their reputation as one of the most successful indigenous bands to emerge from New Zealand.&lt;ref name=officialbio&gt;{{cite web|title=Moana Maniapoto – Profile|url=http://www.moananz.com/biography.html|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 2002, Moana’s former band, Moana &amp; the Moahunters released two albums, ''Tahi'' and ''Rua''.&lt;ref name=muzic&gt;{{cite web|title=Moana And The Tribe – New Zealand Musicians &amp; Bands|url=http://www.muzic.net.nz/artists/671/moana-and-the-tribe|publisher=muzic.net.nz|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their song ''Black Pearl'' reached no. 2 on the national charts in 1991, earning Moana her first gold.&lt;ref name=artsFoundation /&gt;

Moana won the grand prize at the [[2003 International Songwriting Competition]] with her song "Moko".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=ISC IS PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THE 2003 WINNERS |publisher=International Songwriting Competition |url=http://www.songwritingcompetition.com/winners2003.htm |accessdate=17 December 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051213102228/http://www.songwritingcompetition.com/winners2003.htm |archivedate=13 December 2005 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Moana has been described as ‘music of great depth and beauty’ (''[[New Zealand Herald]]'', 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=3523194|title=Moana: Toru|last=Reid|first=Graham|date=12 September 2003|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2004 Queen's Birthday Honours List, Moana was appointed Member of the [[New Zealand Order of Merit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/lists/list.asp?id=27 2004 Queen's Birthday Honours List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813071153/http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/lists/list.asp?id=27 |date=13 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
She is also a Life Time Recipient of the Toi Iho Māori Made Mark and received the 2005 Te Tohu Mahi Hou a Te Waka Toi Award from Te Waka Toi ([[Creative N.Z.]]), in recognition of her outstanding leadership and contribution to the development of new directions in Māori art. Moana received a Music Industry Award at the Maori Waiata 2008 Awards, also for her positive contribution to [[Māori Music]].&lt;ref name=artsFoundation /&gt;

Moana released her fourth album ''Wha'' in May 2008. She toured in 2008 and 2009 Germany, Australia, Netherlands, Turkey, New Zealand and performed at the opening of the [[Biennale in Venice]] / Italy in June 2009.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Moana &amp; the Tribe launched songs from their 5th album ''Rima'' in 2014 at [[Womad NZ]], in a performance described in the ''NZ Herald'' as "the most powerful, enjoyable and important act on the mainstage at this years Womad in Taranaki."

In 2014, Moana and her band formed the Boomerang Collaboration with Scottish band [[Breabach]], [[Shellie Morris]], [[Casey Donovan (singer)|Casey Donovan]] and [[Djakapurra]], playing concerts at Womad NZ, [[Sydney Opera House]] and [[HebCelt]] (Scotland). ''Rima'' was a finalist at the [[2015 Vodafone NZ Music Awards]] and the song "Upokohue" was a finalist in the APRA Maioha Award. It won 2nd place in the World category at the [[International Songwriting Contest]].  
Moana is one half of an award-winning film-making team led by her partner and band member Toby Mills. Their documentary work includes ''Guarding the Family Silver'', which screened in the [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] All Roads Film Festival and ''The Russians are Coming'', which played at the Sydney Opera House during the Message Sticks Indigenous Film Festival in 2012.&lt;ref name=officialbio /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1454">The '''Motion Picture Distributing and Sales Company''' was a major, national [[film|motion picture]] [[film distributor|distribution company]] which operated in the United States between May 31, 1910 and the end of June, 1912. The company distributed almost 2,200 [[silent film|silent era]] motion pictures during its two-year existence.  Its product came from the majority of independent American film producers, which hitherto had distributed their product through states' rights franchisees, as well as a handful of small, independent national distributors, all of whom opposed the attempted monopoly of distribution by the [[General Film Company]], which was a subsidiary of [[Thomas A. Edison|Edison's]] [[Motion Picture Patents Company]]. 

Both [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] and the [[Mutual Film|Mutual Film Corporation]] grew out of the Motion Picture Distributing and Sales Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/film_history/v019/19.3alvarez.pdf The Motion Picture Distributing and Sales Company], Max Joseph Alvarez, Film History: An International Journal, Volume 19, Number 3, 2007, pp. 247-270, [[Indiana University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9073">[[File:Zappert Schlummerlied.png|thumb|Photographic reproduction of the manuscript as published by Zappert (1859).]]
The discovery of an  '''Old High German lullaby''' ('''''{{lang|de|Althochdeutsches Schlummerlied}}''''') was announced in 1859 by [[Georg Zappert]] (1806—1859) of [[Vienna]],  a [[Independent scholar|private scholar]] and collector of [[medieval literature]].
Ostensibly a 10th-century poem full of surviving [[Germanic mythology|pre-Christian mythology]], it is considered a [[literary forgery]] of Zappert by many experts who have commented on it.

==The lullaby==
According to Zappert, in 1852 he noted some words in  [[Old High German]]   on a strip of parchment glued to the spine of a 15th-century paper manuscript ([[Austrian National Library|Hofbibliothek]] Codex Suppl. No. 1668). Zappert says he purchased the manuscript in August 1858, as the recovering of the strip necessitated the destruction of the manuscript binding.  Zappert reports that, once the strip was recovered, it turned out it bore an Old High German poem, apparently a [[lullaby]], in five lines, in a hand of the 9th or 10th century:
# ''{{lang|goh|Tocha slaslumo uueinon sarlazes triuua uuerit craftlicho}}''
# ''{{lang|goh|themo uuolfa uurgianthemo  slafes unza morgane manestrut}}''
# ''{{lang|goh|sunilo  ostra stelit chinde honacegirsuoziu  hera prichitchinde}}''
#''{{lang|goh|pluomun plobun rotiu zanfana sentit morganeueiziu scaf}}''
# ''{{lang|goh|cleiniu  unta einouga herra hurt horsca asca harta}}''

Zappert reads this as seven alliterating verses,  as follows:
#''{{lang|goh|Tocha slafês sliumo / uueinon sar lazzês.}}''
#''{{lang|goh|Triuua uuerit kraftlicho / themo uuolfa uurgiantemo.}}''
#''{{lang|goh|slafês unz za morgane / manes trût sunilo.}}''
#''{{lang|goh|Ostârâ stellit chinde / honak egir suozziu.}}''
#''{{lang|goh|Hera prichit chinde / pluomun plobun rotun.}}''
#''{{lang|goh|Zanfana sentit morgane / ueiziu scaf kleiniu,}}''
#''{{lang|goh|unta Einouga, herra hurt! / horska aska harta.}}''
translated: "(1) ''Docke'', sleep speedily / leave off crying // (2) ''Triuwa'' forcefully / fends off the murdering wolf // (3) May you sleep until morning / dear man's son // (4) ''[[Ostara]]'' for the child leaves / honey and sweet eggs // (5) ''[[Hera]]'' for the child breaks / flowers blue and red // (6) ''[[Zanfana]]'' on the morrow sends // white little sheep // (7) and One-Eye, ''herra hurt'', swift, hard spears."
''Docke'' is a term of endearment addressing the child. [[Triuwa]] is "truth" personified, [[Ostara]] is a hypothetical spring goddess, here portrayed as "leaving eggs for the child", which would be a striking attestation of a pagan origin of [[easter egg]] customs. Also extremely striking would be the survival of [[Tanfana]], a theonym only attested by [[Tacitus]] in the 1st century, in Old High German form. "One-Eye" would be [[Wōden|Wotan]], also a very striking confirmation of the [[Edda]]ic tradition of [[Odin]] being one-eyed, otherwise unattested in West Germanic sources. 

Preceding the Old High German text is a line in Hebrew, {{lang|he|קשת רוח רגל רגע רגש רצון רחץ}}, a list of seven words from a glossary. On the back of the parchment is another line in Hebrew, {{lang|he|   חכמה ואדם יפיק תבונה לך אל }}, a fragment of two verses of [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] (the end of 3:13 and the beginning of 6:6). These appear to be pen trials. Based on this Zappert surmises (p. 12) that the manuscript is due to an early [[German Jew]], perhaps a rabbi or physician, recording a lullaby he may have heard from a wetnurse employed in his house.

Some of the vowels of the lullaby are given in the form of [[Hebrew_alphabet#Vowel_points | Hebrew vowel points]].

==Authenticity debate==
If authentic, the text would afford a rich source for [[Germanic paganism]], giving more detail on the deities mentioned even than the [[Merseburg Incantations]] (discovered 1841). [[Johann Kelle]] (1860) had scathing criticism for Zappert's analysis, disagreeing with literally every one of Zappert's conclusions and emendations, but did not question the authenticity of the document. [[Jacob Grimm]] in  ''Berliner Sitzungsberichte'',  1859,  254—58 refers to Zappert's publication as an independent attestation of the name ''Zanfana'', apparently without doubting its authenticity. In fact, Edwards (2002, p. 150) claims that J. Grimm intended to publish a defence of the lullaby, and “stood out from the beginning because of his enthusiastic advocacy of the lullaby”.

But Grohmann (1861) in a 46-page essay examines the poem in detail and concludes that it is clearly a falsification. 
Since Zappert had died in 1859, he could not defend his position. 

Kletke (1867) still considers the text genuine, but the mainstream opinion in the late 19th century and until today remains Grohmann's. Nevertheless, there have been a few 20th-century scholars defending the poem's authenticity (see Diamant 1960, Howard 1976). 

Fichtenau (1970) again concludes that without a doubt, the poem is a falsification. Edwards (2002, p. 158) states that from six essays which appeared on the topic of the lullaby during the 20th century, three consider it a forgery, while three declare it as genuine. Edwards himself (p. 161) concludes that the evidence adduced in his essay against the authenticity of the lullaby “points more than one finger of suspicion, but falls short of certainty”.

Arguments in favour of the authenticity:
* Howard (1976, p. 34) argues that the text presupposes some linguistic knowledge which could not have been available to Zappert at the time. He specifically mentions the spelling of the sound ''e'' in ''uuerit'' with the Hebrew [[Zeire]], which represents a closed /e/-sound. According to Howard, scholars at the time regarded the /e/-sound from i-mutation as open, and a forger would therefore have chosen the Hebrew [[Segol]] instead of Zeire.

Arguments against the authenticity:
* According to Fichtenau (1970), Zappert is suspected of having produced other forgeries, too. The text of one of them, an old map of Vienna, shows some striking paleographical similarities to the Old High German lullaby (Edwards 2002, p. 156).
* According to Edwards (p. 160f.), F. Mairinger has investigated the ink of the lullaby and the Hebrew line and concluded that unlike the remaining Hebrew words, they were not executed “in the typical medieval 'Eisengallentinte' with soot admixture”. This points to a forgery. (The parchment and the Hebrew pen trials appear to be medieval, though).
* It is known that the unusual link between Germanic and Hebrew culture manifested by the writing on this piece of parchment was a topic “dear to Zappert's heart” (Edwards 2002, p. 160), being of Jewish origin himself, and this could have provided a motive for a forgery. 
* The information given about heathen gods in the lullaby curiously matches some passages in J. Grimm's book ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'' (first published in 1835), where Grimm lamented a lack of sources. This suggests that “Zappert looked for holes in Grimm's ''Deutsche Mythologie'', and sought to plug them.” (Edwards 2002, p. 157).

[[File:United States penny, obverse, 2002.png|thumb|220px|right|A [[proof coinage|proof]]-quality penny]]
A debate exists within the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]], and [[Culture of the United States|American society]] at large, over whether the [[cent (United States coin)|one-cent coin]], commonly called the [[penny]], should be [[withdrawal of low-denomination coins|eliminated]] as a unit of [[currency]] in the [[United States]]. Several [[bill (proposed law)|bills]] introduced in the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] would have ceased production of pennies, but none has been approved. Such bills would leave the [[nickel (United States coin)|nickel]], at five cents, as the lowest-value coin in the United States.

== Legislation ==
In 1990, [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] [[Jim Kolbe]] [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Arizona|AZ]]] introduced the Price Rounding Act of 1989, H.R. 3761 to eliminate the penny in cash transactions, rounding to the nearest nickel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c101:H.R.3761.IH: H.R.3761{{snd}} Price Rounding Act of 1989 (Introduced in House{{snd}} IH)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Kolbe introduced the Legal Tender Modernization Act of 2001, H.R. 5818,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:h.r.02528: Legal Tender Modernization Act of 2001, HR 2528]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006, he introduced the Currency Overhaul for an Industrious Nation (C.O.I.N.) Act, H.R. 5818.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Christian Zappone |title= Kill-the-penny bill introduced |url= http://money.cnn.com/2006/07/18/news/penny/index.htm |publisher= CNN Money |date=2006-07-18 |accessdate=2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the bills received much popular support from the public, the bills were not made into law.&lt;ref name="eliminate"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.reuters.com/investing/financeArticle.aspx?type=bondsNews&amp;storyID=2006-07-20T120021Z_01_N17321144_RTRIDST_0_LIFE-PENNY-GENERAL-FEATURE.XML
|title=Nickel for your thoughts? US bill seeks penny's end |publisher=Reuters |date=2006-07-20|accessdate=2006-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, there is public pressure on many Representatives to reintroduce these bills to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://polis.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=253573 COINS Act Reforms Wasteful $1 Presidential Coin Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, U.S. Senators [[John McCain]] [R-AZ] and [[Mike Enzi]] [R-WY] introduced S. 759, the Currency, Optimization, Innovation, and National Savings (C.O.I.N.S.) Act of 2017, that would stop minting of the penny for ten years and would study the question of whether production could cease thereafter.

Since March 29, 2017, S. 759 has been in the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/759&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for elimination==
*'''Production at a loss'''{{snd}} {{As of|2016}}, it costs 2.41 cents to mint a penny.&lt;ref name="usmintreport2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usmint.gov/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017AnnualReport.pdf |title=2017 Annual Report |publisher=United States Mint |accessdate=May 29, 2018 |pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in an annual loss of approximately $50 million. The price of the raw materials from which the penny is made exceed the face value, so there is a risk that coins will be illegally melted down for raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usmint.gov/pressroom/index.cfm?flash=yes&amp;action=press_release&amp;ID=771|title=United States Mint Moves to Limit Exportation &amp; Melting of Coins|date=2007-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Lost productivity and opportunity cost of use'''{{snd}} With the median [[wage]] in the US being $18.12 per hour in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=|last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=May 2017 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates United States |url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000 |work= |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |page= |date=2018-03-30 |accessdate=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; it takes less than two seconds to earn one cent. Thus, it is not worthwhile for most people to deal with a penny. If it takes only two seconds extra for each transaction that uses a penny, the cost of time wasted in the US is about $3.65 per person annually,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sebastian |last= Mallaby |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Penny Stops Here |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/24/AR2006092400946.html |work= |publisher=The Washington Post |page= A21|date=2006-09-25 |accessdate=2007-08-09 |quote=The median worker earns just over $36,000 a year, or about 0.5 cents per second, so futzing with pennies costs him $3.65 annually.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about one billion dollars for all Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mankiw |first=Greg |authorlink=N.

"That's going to add up to about $300 million per year for the U.S. economy," Whaples said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Whaples argues that eliminating the penny would coax people into using [[Dollar coin (United States)|one dollar coins]]. The Federal Reserve says that replacing one dollar bills with one dollar coins would save an additional five hundred million dollars per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfu.edu/wfunews/2006/2006.07.18.w.html |title=Professor's research supports eliminating penny |publisher=Wake Forest University |date=July 18, 2006 |accessdate=January 17, 2015 |author=Barrett, Maggie |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061201205131/http://www.wfu.edu/wfunews/2006/2006.07.18.w.html |archive-date=December 1, 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Limited utility'''{{snd}} Pennies are not accepted by any [[vending machine]]s or by most [[toll booths]], and are generally not accepted in bulk. Economist [[Greg Mankiw]] says that "The purpose of the monetary system is to facilitate exchange, but...the penny no longer serves that purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mankiw |first=Greg |authorlink=N. Gregory Mankiw |title=Resolutions for Another New Year |work= Greg Mankiw's Blog |date=2006-12-31 |url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/12/resolutions-for-another-new-year.html |accessdate=2009-12-28|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pennies often drop out of circulation (e.g. they are stored in jars in a person's home) and due to their low value are sometimes even discarded by consumers. This contributes to the United States Mint needing to produce more pennies than all other coins combined.
*'''Prices would not be higher'''{{snd}} Research by Robert Whaples, an economics professor at [[Wake Forest University]], using data on nearly two hundred thousand transactions from a multi-state convenience store chain shows that rounding would have virtually no effect. Consumers would gain a tiny amount{{snd}} about {{frac|40}}¢ per transaction.&lt;ref name=Whaples07&gt;Robert Whaples, "[http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eej:eeconj:v:33:y:2007:i:1:p:139-146 Time to Eliminate the Penny from the U.S. Coinage System: New Evidence]," ''Eastern Economic Journal'', vol. 33, issue 1, pp. 139–146 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Elimination would not hurt the poor'''{{snd}} Given that rounding (based on cash transaction totals being rounded up and down to the nearest multiple of five cents) is neutral at the transaction level, and that cash transactions are faster without having to deal with extremely low-value coins, people who disproportionately deal in cash transactions would be helped more by elimination of the penny. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.retirethepenny.org/myths.html&lt;/ref&gt; To gain consumer favor for reducing the use of the penny it could be legislated (either on a state or federal level) that all cash transactions totals over a nominal amount (say 25 cents) would need to be rounded ''down'' to the nearest multiple of five cents. Rounding down cash transaction totals is a win for the merchant too as it encourages cash sales and thereby avoids the electronic payment fee (typically in the order of two percent of the balance) as often.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraphherald.com/news/opinion/article_70bb63f6-6823-5f2d-9ce5-718c0daa6899.html|title=Letter: For change, do away with the penny|last=Dubuque|first=From Joe Koch Pheasant Lane,|work=TelegraphHerald.com|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Recent popular support'''{{snd}} According to a national survey conducted in January 2017 by the polling team of Hart Research Associates and Public Opinion Strategies on behalf of the Dollar Coin Alliance, there is broad support for eliminating the penny. The Hart/POS survey found that 77 percent of voters support suspending production of the penny. When told of the savings made by suspending the penny, support jumped to 84 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dollarcoinalliance.org/2017/03/29/press-release-new-legislation-will-provide-billions-in-budget-savings-by-modernizing-dollar-currency-reducing-cost-of-nickel-production-and-suspending-the-penny/|title=Press release|last=|first=|date=2017-03-29|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Historical precedents'''{{snd}} There has never been a coin in circulation in the U.S. worth as little as the penny is worth today, although currently other countries have coins with less purchasing power in circulation. Due to [[monetary inflation|inflation]], one [[5-cent piece (United States)|nickel]] in 2018 was worth approximately what a penny was worth in 1974.&lt;ref name="bls"&gt;http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl CPI Inflation Calculator&lt;/ref&gt; When the United States discontinued the [[half cent (United States coin)|half-cent coin]] in 1857, it had a 2018-equivalent buying power of about 14 cents. &lt;ref name="Measuring Worth"&gt;https://measuringworth.com/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; After 1857, the new smallest coin was the one-cent, which had a 2018-equivalent buying power of 27 cents.&lt;ref name="Measuring Worth"/&gt; The nickel fell below that value in 1973; the [[dime (United States coin)|dime]] (at ten cents) fell below that value in 1981; the [[quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] (at twenty-five cents) fell below that value in 2012.&lt;ref name="Consumer Price Index Research Series"&gt;https://www.bls.gov/cpi/research-series/home.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Zinc toxicity'''{{snd}} [[Zinc toxicity|Zinc]] can cause anemia or gastric ulceration in babies that inadvertently ingest pennies made after 1982. A single penny can kill a pet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dog-fatally-poisoned-by-one-penny/&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Environmental hazard'''{{snd}}The mining of [[Zinc toxicity|zinc]] and copper causes toxic pollution and is especially undesirable when considering the valuable metals are being used to produce a useless coin.
*'''Effort to transport and count'''{{snd}}Approximately sixty percent of coins minted are pennies and all these pennies (generally over five billion annually) must be transported by secure and therefore expensive means from the Mint to banks and then onto stores. Store employees spend valuable time counting low value pennies at the end of a work shift. Banks often return loose coins on an armored truck to be sorted and wrapped so as to be ready to be given out to a customer. This process costs on the order of ten cents per roll (a hefty twenty percent charge on a roll of fifty pennies).

==Arguments for preservation==
*'''Consumers and the economy'''{{snd}} Research commissioned by the zinc lobby and its [[front group]] [[Americans for Common Cents]] concludes that were the penny to be eliminated, consumers might be hit with a "rounding tax". The paper stated that rather than eliminate the penny, it could make more sense to change the composition of the penny to a cheaper metal than zinc if the costs of zinc do not come down and there continues to be a significant loss per penny.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116360150549923901 Managing Change: Is the Penny Worth Keeping? with Raymond Lombra, an economics professor at Pennsylvania State University, and Robert Whaples, a professor and chairman of the economics department at Wake Forest University]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Historical popular support'''{{snd}}A poll conducted in June 2006 by USA Today/Gallup, found that fifty-five percent of the American public considered the penny to be a useful coin, while forty-three percent of those surveyed were in favor of abolishing the coin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Americans For Common Cents: 66% of Americans Favor Keeping the Penny|author=Carrol, Joseph|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/23779/penny-worth-saving-say-americans.aspx|newspaper=Gallup|date=July 17, 2006|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this poll was taken more people are in favor of eliminating the penny due to the penny's reduced value.
*'''Increased cost'''{{snd}} Commissioned by Jarden Zinc, which supplies zinc "penny blanks" to the Mint, a report conducted by Navigant Consulting found that the government would lose money without the penny. According to Americans for Common Cents' website, "First, the Mint's fabrication and distribution costs include fixed components that will continue to be incurred whether or not the Mint produces the penny. Navigant estimates this fixed component at $13 million in FY 2011. Plus, there is $17.7 million in Mint overhead allocated to the penny that would have to be absorbed by the remaining denominations of circulating coins without the penny. Second, under current Mint accounting, the nickel costs eleven cents to manufacture. In a scenario (unlikely to occur) where nickel production doubled without the penny, Navigant concludes that with existing fixed costs, eliminating the penny would likely result in increased net costs to the Mint of $10.9 million, relative to the current state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pennies.org/index.php/penny-the-economy/penny-profitability |title=Penny Profitability: What Does it Really Cost to Make a Penny? |work=Americans for Common Cents |accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pennies.org/images/stories/pdfs/penny-profitability-april-12-2012.pdf Navigant Consulting: Impact of Eliminating the Penny on the United States Mint's Costs and Profit in the Fiscal year 2011] by Rodney J. Bosco and Kevin M. Davis&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Rounding hurts the poor'''{{snd}} Millions of transactions are conducted each day in the US economy, and with twenty-six percent of Americans either not having savings or checking accounts or relying on payday lending services, there are many cash transactions taking place involving American citizens each day. Federal Reserve studies have shown that people with relatively low incomes use cash more frequently than individuals with higher incomes. Since only cash transactions will be subject to rounding, a 2001 study indicates that any move to eliminate the penny may disproportionately hurt "unbanked" Americans who have no other option and lack the means to make non-cash transactions. The study, authored by [[Raymond Lombra]], concluded that eliminating the penny would impose a "rounding tax" of at least six hundred million dollars per year on American consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://college.holycross.edu/RePEc/eej/Archive/Volume27/V27N4P433_442.pdf |title=Eliminating the Penny from the U.S. Coinage System: An Economic Analysis |work=Eastern Economic Journal |date=Fall 2001 |accessdate=December 27, 2015 |author=[[Raymond Lombra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's elimination of the penny, however, rounds cash transactions both up and down.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mint.ca/store/mint/about-the-mint/phasing-out-the-penny-6900002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nickels==
As of 2017, nickels cost 5.94 cents to produce,&lt;ref name="usmintreport2017"/&gt; providing an argument for elimination similar to the penny's production at a loss. The face value of a nickel is also well below that of the lowest-denomination coin (the penny) at the time of the half-cent's elimination in 1857.&lt;ref name="bls"/&gt; Unlike the penny, the nickel is mostly redundant (when exchanging {{var|d}} dollars and {{var|c}} cents, if {{var|c}} is not 5–9 or 15–19, the amount can be given without nickels and still weigh less, with at most one additional coin, than if a nickel is included) and less commonly used; the nickel is nonetheless accepted by most vending machines while the penny is not. No bills have yet been proposed to remove the nickel from circulation; however, if the composition of the nickel were to be changed from the present 75/25 copper-nickel alloy to [[stainless steel]], which has been successfully used in many countries, the nickel would cost far less than five cents to produce. The US Mint has studied other alternative metal mixtures and an 80/20 copper-nickel alloy would lower the cost of the nickel (albeit it still would likely be minted at a loss) while desirably allowing coin sorting machines to function without modification.

==Lobbying==

{{See also|Withdrawal of low-denomination coins}}
Many countries outside the United States have chosen to remove low-value coins from circulation:

However, many nations still use coins of similar or smaller value to the United States cent. In some cases, while the nominal value of the coin may be smaller than that of a US cent, the [[purchasing power]] may be higher:
*The [[South Korea|Republic of Korea (South Korea)]] stopped minting 1-[[South Korean won|won]] and five-won coins, but ten-won coins (worth about US$0.01) are still minted with changing composition and used only in supermarkets.
*Some countries in the [[Eurozone]] use one and two-cent coins. As posted prices generally include taxes, it is possible (but not standard) for vendors to round prices to the nearest five cents and eliminate the need for smaller-value coins. However, [[Finland]], [[Ireland]] and the [[Netherlands]] have [[Swedish rounding|abandoned]] the use of one and two-cents altogether. Finland only ever produced a small number of one-cent coins, mostly for collecting and legal reasons.
*[[Panama]] and [[Ecuador]], which use the United States dollar as their currency, mint their own coins including one-centavo pieces identical in size to the penny. However, prices and wages are generally lower in those countries compared to the United States.

'''Piano burning''' is the act of setting on fire an acoustic piano, most commonly an [[Upright piano|upright]], as either a ceremony or a form of [[performance art]]. Although piano burning ceremonies are now popular in both the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[United States Air Force]], there is little or no evidence to suggest that descriptions of its origin have any historical authenticity. According to one version of its origin, pianos were set alight by RAF pilots to avoid piano lessons aimed at improving their dexterity and general level of culture, however there is no evidence of this myth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Another version is that piano burning began in World War II in remembrance of fallen RAF pilots. Several contemporary musicians, including [[Annea Lockwood]], [[Yōsuke Yamashita]], and [[Diego Stocco]], have composed for and performed on pianos which have been deliberately set alight. A burning piano was also the centrepiece of [[Douglas Gordon]]'s 2012 [[video installation]], ''The End of Civilisation''.

== Ceremonial piano burning ==
In ''The Phantom in Focus: A Navigator's Eye on Britain's Cold War Warrior'', David Gledhill recounts a combat training exercise in Germany during the [[Cold War]] where [[SEPECAT Jaguar|Jaguar]] pilots from [[RAF Wildenrath]] and [[RAF Bruggen]] had the task of destroying a piano placed on Nordhorn Ridge with a single practice bomb. Because the target was so small, it was only the last Jaguar on the last flight of the exercise that finally managed to hit it. The pilots from both bases celebrated that evening at RAF Wildenrath by burning a second piano in the Officers' Mess.&lt;ref&gt;David Gledhill, David (2014). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Nl8rAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT132 ''The Phantom in Focus: A Navigator's Eye on Britain's Cold War Warrior''], p. 132. Fonthill Media. {{ISBN|1781552045}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although piano burning has become popular with air forces and especially the [[Royal Air Force]] since World War II, its origin is undocumented and has been the subject of myth and decades of storytelling.&lt;ref name ="Heidicker" /&gt;

One of the most common legends traces its origin to the British Royal Air Force sometime between World War I and II when so many pilots died during World War I that the RAF was forced to select its pilots from the common population, instead of their usual preference for upper-class families. Attempts were made to educate the pilots on refined manners and tastes, but these lessons became very unpopular among the pilots, especially the piano lessons which the Royal Air Force believed would increase the pilots' level of culture and improve their dexterity. According to this story, the burning began at [[RAF Leuchars]], where the only piano at the base burned down accidentally and piano lessons were cancelled. Word spread, and soon pilots at more and more Royal Air Force bases began to burn the pianos to avoid lessons.&lt;ref name = "Crowell"&gt;Crowell, Lt. Col. Miles (26 August 2005).

Retrieved 22 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Heidicker" /&gt; This version is unverified and largely mythological.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;!--Two sources are cited in support--who says they are wrong?--&gt; Another legendary version of the tradition's origin holds that RAF piano burning began as a tribute to fallen airmen. According to the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'', a piano-playing pilot in the Royal Air Force during World War II played to his fellow airmen each time one of their number had been killed. When he himself was killed in action, his comrades decided that "if he couldn't play the piano any more, nobody would, so they dragged it outside and set it alight."&lt;ref&gt;Eriksen, Alanah (30 April 2010).

Piano burning ceremonies based on the RAF tradition are also held by the [[US Air Force]]. A piano was ceremonially burnt at [[Langley Air Force Base]] in 2011 to celebrate the 94th anniversary of the [[94th Fighter Squadron]].&lt;ref name = "Watson"&gt;Watson, Racheal (23 August 2011).

Although piano burning ceremonies are primarily carried out by the UK and US air forces, the Roxbury Tavern near [[Sauk City, Wisconsin]] has held an annual piano burning ceremony since 2004 to mark the [[Summer Solstice]]. A eulogy for the piano is delivered prior to it being set alight, and afterwards its remains are placed on display in the tavern's garden along with those of burnt pianos from previous years.&lt;ref&gt;Stingl, Jim (23 June 2015).

== Compositions for burning pianos ==
===Annea Lockwood===
In 1968, New Zealand composer [[Annea Lockwood]] wrote a piece called ''Piano Burning''.&lt;ref&gt;Annea Lockwood, "Piano Burning and Tiger Balm," ''Source'' no.9 (1971), p. 48. The written description includes a photograph of Lockwood executing the work.  A recording of the work ("Source Record Number Six") came with that issue of the periodical.&lt;/ref&gt; The score specifies that the performer uses an upright piano that is beyond repair. In the composers words, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Piano burning should really be done with an upright piano; the structure is much more beautiful than that of a grand when you watch it burn. The piano must always be one that’s irretrievable, that nobody could work on, that no tuner or rebuilder could possibly bring back. It’s got to be a truly defunct piano."&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood, Annea (July 2009). [http://www.utne.com/arts/bonfire-of-the-ivories-visualize-your-piano-burning.aspx "Bonfire of the Ivories: Visualize Your Piano-Burning"]. ''Utne Reader''. Ogden Publications. Retrieved 22 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; She asks the performer to soak paper in lighter fluid, set it alight, and drop it into the piano. She also specifies that balloons may be attached, and the piano may be played for as long as the performer is able. ''Piano Burning'' is a part of her ''Piano Transplants'' series, which also includes ''Piano Drowning'', ''Piano Garden'', and ''Southern Exposure''.&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood, Annea (2006). [http://ro.ecu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=csound "How to Prepare a Piano"]. ''Sound Scripts: Proceedings of the inaugural Totally huge New Musical Festival Conference 2005''.

===Yōsuke Yamashita===
[[Yōsuke Yamashita]] first performed on a burning piano in 1973, when asked by Japanese graphic designer Kiyoshi Awazu to be the subject in his short film, ''burning piano''. 35 years later, at the age of 66, Yamashita re-watched the film and was inspired to repeat the performance. Dressed in a protective firefighter's uniform, Yamashita improvised on the burning piano during sunset on a beach in western Japan. He said of the experience,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I did not think I was risking my life but I was almost suffocating from the smoke that was continuously getting into my eyes and nose. I had decided to keep on playing until the piano stopped making sounds, so though I did not mean it but it ended up having a life-or-death battle between the piano and myself."&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuters]] (19 March 2008). [http://www.itnsource.com/en/shotlist/RTV/2008/03/19/RTV2104208/?v=1 "Japanese Pianist Plays the Burning Piano at a Sunset Beach."] ITNSource. Retrieved 22 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
The pianos used for both of Yamashita's performances were donated, decade-old broken ones.

===Diego Stocco===
[[Diego Stocco]] composed a piece called ''The Burning Piano'', which is made up entirely of his recordings of a burning piano. Stocco began the burning process by pointing a butane lighter directly towards the strings and played single notes, and after the flame was extinguished he played with what remained.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, Emerson (3 October 2011). [http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/diego-stocco-can-make-music-out-of-anything-including-a-burning-piano "Diego Stocco Can Make Music Out of Anything, Including A Burning Piano]. ''The Creators Project''. Vice Media. Retrieved 22 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded the entire process and later rearranged samples to create the piece of music. The virtual instrument company [[Spectrasonics]] created a sample library called Omnisphere which includes a ''Burning Piano'' sample recorded by Stocco.

===Michael Hannan===
[[Michael Hannan (composer)|Michael Hannan]]'s compositions have often involved pieces for pianos which have been altered in some way, including being set on fire. His 2003 ''Burning Questions'', a radiophonic work commissioned by [[ABC Radio National]], explored the "cultural politics of auto-destructive music" and included the sounds of a burning baby grand piano (with a microphone placed inside), the observers' reactions, and Hannan playing Beethoven's ''[[Moonlight Sonata]]'' on the piano immediately prior to setting it alight. According to Hannan:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The act of burning a piano [...] stimulates a strong emotional response from an audience. I became more interested in the crowd's response than in the sounds made from the piano itself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The piano burning  which forms the basis of the work had taken place on 2 October 1999 at [[Bellingen, New South Wales]]. The composer [[Barry Conyngham]], one of the observers at the burning, was heard to remark that he found "burning a perfectly good microphone more sacrilegious than burning a piano."&lt;ref&gt;Pleskun, Stephen (2014). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QTM8AwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Hannan#v=snippet&amp;q=Hannan&amp;f=false ''A Chronological History of Australian Composers and Their Compositions: Vol. 4 1999-2013''], pp. 144; 209; 404; 691.

==Piano burning as visual art==
===Arman===
The destruction of musical instruments, often by fire, was a recurrent theme in [[Arman]]'s work. Two of his most notable works involving piano burning were his 1965 ''Piano de Néron'' ([[Nero]]'s Piano) and his 1966 ''Piano Flamboyant'' (Flaming Piano). The burning for ''Piano Flamboyant'' took place on the roof of Arman's atelier in Nice and was filmed for a documentary by [[Gérard Patris]] which was later broadcast on French national television. As with his other burnt instrument works, which also included violins, cellos, and guitars, the charred remains were then mounted on panels or enclosed in plexiglas. One of Arman's earliest works of piano destruction was his 1962 ''Chopin's Waterloo'' which took at the Galerie Saqqârah in [[Gstaad]]. On that occasion rather than burning the piano, the artist hacked it to pieces with an axe.&lt;ref&gt;''Une histoire de la performance sur la Côte d'Azur de 1951 à nos jours'' (performance-art.fr). [http://performance-art.fr/fr/performance/destruction-piano "Destruction de piano"]. Retrieved 17 November 2015 {{fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chiharu Shiota===
Several of [[Chiharu Shiota]]'s installations have featured a piano which she had set alight with the charred remains then displayed in an installation of black thread.  As part of the 2011 [[MONA FOMA]] arts festival, Shiota set the piano alight on a street in [[Hobart, Tasmania]]. According to Shiota, the inspiration came from a childhood experience when she saw a charred piano amidst the ruins of a neighbour's house which had burnt down in the night.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwin, Skye (24 February 2010).

===Douglas Gordon===
[[Douglas Gordon]]'s 2012 video installation ''The End of Civilisation'' was centred on a burning [[grand piano]] placed in the isolated landscape of [[Cumbria]] on the border between Scotland and England. According to Gordon:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A piano started to represent for me the ultimate symbol of western civilisation. Not only is it an instrument, it's a beautiful object that works as a sculpture but it has another function entirely.&lt;ref name = "Sykes"&gt;Sykes, Alan (22 May 2012).

Retrieved 5 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The work, displayed simultaneously on multiple screens, consists of close-up film of the burning piano from the moment it is set alight until it is reduced to ashes juxtaposed with a second film which is a 360 degree pan of the [[Anglo-Scottish border|Scottish Borders]] landscape surrounding the piano. After its premiere at the [[Tyne Theatre and Opera House]] in July 2012, ''The End of Civilisation'' was shown at the [[2012 Cultural Olympiad#London 2012 Festival|London 2012 Festival]] and toured as part of a Douglas Gordon retrospective in Tel Aviv followed by screenings in Venice, New York, and Berlin.&lt;ref name = "Sykes" /&gt;

'''Pseudorealism''', also spelled '''pseudo-realism''', is a term used in a variety of discourses connoting [[art]]istic and dramatic techniques, or work of art, film and literature perceived as superficial, ''not-real'', or non-realistic.&lt;ref name="ELS-AM"&gt;Eric Loren Smoodin, Ann Martin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R-Fs0Vwa_nQC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=%22pseudo-realism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xaHOTtSkB8OViQKC6LXPBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pseudo-realism%22&amp;f=false ''Hollywood quarterly: film culture in postwar America, 1945-1957.'' Page 235.] ''University of California Press.''&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, the term is highly subjective.&lt;ref name="huxley"&gt;[http://www.huxley.net/  A Defence Of Paradise-Engineering.] ''BLTC Research'', 1998. ''Use of term: pseudo-realism.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term pseudo-realism has been used to describe a certain type of cultural commodities such as film productions and TV programmes which portray everyday life in excessively realistic detail in order to achieve greater impact on viewers.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite book |title=The Culture Industry Revisited: Theodor W. Adorno on Mass Culture |author=Prof. Deborah Cook |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UtwDwenWBwC&amp;q=pseudo-realism |pages=46, 100 |ISBN=0847681556}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the great shift towards expressionism in painting, André Bazin used the word ''pseudoreal'' in reference to mechanical means which freed the plastic arts from the drive toward 'unachievable likeness'. Meanwhile, [[photorealist]]ic CGI animation and [[3D computer graphics]] used today have become indistinguishable from cine-photography. In that regard, the [[special effects]] augmenting feature film through photographic deception of the eye have gained an entirely different dimension.&lt;ref name="Surman"&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Surman |url=https://www.academia.edu/168038/CGI_Animation_Pseudorealism_Perception_and_Possible_Worlds  |title=CGI Animation - Pseudorealism, Perception and Possible Worlds |work=Master's Thesis |publisher=GameCareerGuide.com (reprint)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer generated imagery and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] animation are used not only to bolster reality based images but also to create imaginary worlds.  
{{quote|We understand the CGI feature film to be an image of pseudorealism in Bazin’s terms – a fundamental deception of the eye. Of course the cinema itself in whatever incarnation involves a deception of the eye, that of the ‘persistence of vision’ effect. Though things appear to exist and have causal properties, they are the product of man-made parameters. — David Surman, "CGI Animation: Pseudorealism, Perception and Possible Worlds" &lt;ref name="Surman"/&gt;}}

Christopher Hitchens equates ''pseudo-realism'' with [[Socialist realism]] of the Stalinist era as exposed by Orwell.&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;Christopher Hitchens, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9GnOe11NJXUC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=definition+of+pseudo-realism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4f_qyMo9cg&amp;sig=VUkTJ3B4EpDI3VQTv8Bu9cIqhsk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iprOToTmOYPKiALAnP28Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=definition%20of%20pseudo-realism&amp;f=false  ''Why Orwell Matters''.

{{nihongo|'''''Sankarea: Undying Love'''''|さんかれあ|Sankarea|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Mitsuru Hattori]]. The manga was serialized in [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine]]'' between December 2009 and September 2014 and compiled in eleven ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes. The series has been licensed and is published in North America by [[Kodansha USA]]. An [[anime]] television adaptation by [[Studio Deen]] aired in Japan from April 5 to June 28, 2012. A novel adaptation by Ryō Suzukaze was published by Kodansha in July 2012.

== Plot ==
Chihiro Furuya is a male high school student with a keen interest in zombies, collecting zombie-related videogames, film and manga, and even to the point of desiring to "kiss a zombie girl". Following the death of his pet cat, Babu, he attempts to revive it using an old manuscript, which describes the process of creating a potion for resurrection. At this time, he encounters a girl named Rea Sanka, who has run away from home. In an attempt to commit suicide, she drinks a sample of the "resurrection" potion which is created from the poisonous ''[[Hydrangea macrophylla]]'' flower, although this fails to kill her. Following an argument with her father, she falls from a cliff by accident and dies. However, as a result of the potion, she becomes a zombie who eats hydrangea leaves to survive. The story follows the life of Chihiro and his new 'zombie girlfriend'.

== Characters ==

===Main characters===
&lt;!-- four of them as listed by anime official website:  http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/sankarea/character/ --&gt;
;{{nihongo|Chihiro Furuya|降谷 千紘|Furuya Chihiro}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Ryōhei Kimura]]&lt;ref name="jp chars"/&gt;|[[Aaron Dismuke]]}}
:Chihiro is the protagonist of the story who has a zombie obsession/fetish. He finds an old manuscript and follows the directions to make a "resurrection" potion to bring his dead cat back to life as a zombie. He performs his research into zombies in the old abandoned building and he sometimes sees Rea at the well near the building, lamenting her life. He promises Rea that he'll take responsibility if she becomes a zombie. After Rea moves into his residence, he conducts research on preserving Rea's body in a tent in his own room. He wants his first kiss to be given by a female zombie, which later he experiences firsthand when Rea kisses him. He also experiences becoming a half-zombie, after he is stabbed by Dan'ichirō with a fencing sword. In the Anime this was due to Rea licking clean a wound that he acquired after she saved him from being hit by a car (although the effects were only temporary). In the Manga she had bitten his lip when she 'kissed' him. Chihiro enjoys seeing Rea dressed as a Bunny Girl or a Nurse. Despite the fact that he's not interested in living girls, he fell in love with Rea when she was still alive, which he confesses to her while Rea is trying to devour him, which brings her to her senses. He tries to approach her afterwards but has difficulties given the incident and Rea's own embarrassment. In the Manga it's hinted that his interest in zombies may be due to his mother having been turned into a zombie. She had apparently died in a car accident and was brought back for a short period (by Jogorō) before becoming permanently dead. In the end of the manga, Chihiro's heart was eaten by Rea, but he was given an artificial heart to survive.

;{{nihongo|Rea Sanka|散華 礼弥|Sanka Rea}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Maaya Uchida]]&lt;ref name="jp chars"&gt;http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/sankarea/character&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Tia Ballard]]}}
:Rea is the heroine [[title character]] of the story who steals and drinks a zombie potion made by Chihiro in an attempt to commit suicide because of years of abuse by her father. Although he hadn't had sex with her (although it might have been leading up to that) he had touched her in a manner that made her uncomfortable, took nude pictures of her on her birthday "to note her growth", had her watched and photographed constantly, fired any maid who acted 'inappropriately' (like letting Rea play with a stray cat), and he forced the family of the one friend she had confided in about his behavior to move away. The potion wasn't enough to kill her, but she was resurrected as a zombie after her father accidentally knocked her off a cliff (the fall would not have killed her, except that she encountered a tree stump on the way down which tore into her stomach). As a zombie, she lives together with Chihiro in order to know how it feels to become free from her father's control. In chapter 12, she calls Mero "Mero[[-chan]]", similar to how Mero remembers her mother. Rea likes Chihiro and feels that she is interfering in Chihiro and Ranko's relationship, although Ranko later encourages her to try harder, which she does, albeit with embarrassment. She seems to understand Bābu and is the only zombie that Jogorō and Darin have seen able to defy her instincts at the 2nd stage of zombification, possibly due to her having drunk the potion before dying (which Darin suggests no other zombie has done). She's also physically strong, since her body is no longer restrained by her brain as a result of her death. (There are several 'governors' in the brain and body which limits action to prevent moving faster and stronger than the flesh can endure. So, while Rea could punch a hole in a steel door, the action would severely damage her arm.) In the arc in which they visit "Zoma" she suffers from memory loss due to the removal of her brain cells. Although she can only remember very few of her buried, yet etched memories, her memories of Chihiro remain vague and unclear. She gains her memories back when she eats Chihiro's heart.

;{{nihongo|Ranko Saōji|左王子 蘭子|Saōji Ranko}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Sayuri Yahagi]]&lt;ref name="jp chars"/&gt;|[[Jamie Marchi]]}}
:Ranko is the first cousin of Chihiro. Often called Wanko by Chihiro, at times she says that Chihiro should use "[[-san]]" after her name. Ranko has liked Chihiro for some time (Since he saved her from a dog when she was about 6 years old. But, unknown to her, he was only trying to protect the DVD with which she was shielding herself) and develops a rivalry with Rea although she also likes to tease them. She eventually confesses to Chihiro, but realizes before he can answer that he loves Rea. She has accepted that her love is unrequited for now, but hasn't given up and occasionally does something reckless such as ingesting a bottle of Resurrection Pills to turn herself into a zombie. Fortunately this failed since Darin was too lazy to change the bottle label and she merely passed out from a minor allergic reaction.

;{{nihongo|Mero Furuya|降谷 萌路|Furuya Mero}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Yuka Iguchi]]&lt;ref name="jp chars"/&gt;|[[Felecia Angelle]]}}
:Mero is the younger sister of Chihiro. She's named after [[George A. Romero|George Romero]]. Unlike Chihiro, she is obsessed with [[ghost]]s. She doesn't remember much about her mother except for the fact that her hands were wrapped in bandages. In some of her memories of her mother, she remembered her mother asking about her fever, stating that she had forgotten that she can't tell temperature. She sees her mother's image in Rea, subconsciously calling her mother.

===Furuya family===
;{{nihongo|Jogorō Furuya|降谷 茹五郎|Furuya Jogorō}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Shirō Saitō]]|[[Mike McFarland]]}}
:Jogorō is Chihiro and Mero's grandfather also known as Professor Boil. He's the creator of the recipe for the Resurrection potion. He was a well respected professor in the United States researching zombies, and performed a multitude of experiments with them. He however left his research for unknown reasons, and although he still has great knowledge of zombies he rarely says anything useful due to his senility. After discovering Rea in the shower, he mistakes her for someone by the name of Sada (his first wife from the [[Meiji period]]). He occasionally states how Sada has been resurrected but no one ever knows who he is talking about, considering that was not a name they were familiar with. People then dismiss it as being caused by his senility. Later it is revealed that his senility and bad eyesight are side effects of exposure to fatal amounts of poison. Occasionally, events trigger brief periods of sanity which allow him to clearly tell Chihiro how to keep Rea conscious and in good shape as well as inform him that the Resurrection potion is incomplete. The measures revealed by Jogorō will only slow down, but not stop decay, so eventually Rea will rot away unless Chihiro comes up with a better solution.

;{{nihongo|Do'on Furuya|降谷 呶恩|Furuya Doōn}}
:{{Voiced by|Seirō Ogino|[[Christopher Corey Smith|Chris Smith]]}}
:Chihiro and Mero's father and also the priest at the Shiryō-ji [[Buddhist temples in Japan|temple]].

;{{nihongo|Yuzuna Furuya|降谷 柚菜|Furuya Yuzuna}}
:{{animevoices|[[Yurika Hino]]|[[Caitlin Glass]]}}
:Chihiro and Mero's late mother, who died prior to the series. It's hinted that after a fatal car accident she was revived as a zombie for a short while, most likely by Grandfather Jogorō. Evidence of this is seen in Mero's flashbacks where her mother has bandaged hands and remarks that she can't tell Mero's temperature from her forehead with her hand anymore. Some of the flashbacks are triggered by Rea acting in a similar manner to Yuzune. At some point Yuzune says goodbye (most likely because she started hungering for the flesh of her loved ones) and dies completely.

;{{nihongo|Babu|ばーぶ|Bābu}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Misato Fukuen]]|[[Monica Rial]]}}
:Babu is Chihiro's pet cat that died in a car accident three days prior to the start of the series. He's named after the tamed zombie in the movie [[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]] however in the anime it is stated he is named after the sound he makes due to his seemingly permanent [[nasal congestion]]. He was brought back to life by Chihiro while doing resurrection research on him. Rea seems to understand Babu as a zombie. Like Rea, his body is not restrained by his brain and he was able to kill a fox much bigger than himself. However, unlike Rea, he has not been able to stave off his zombie instincts. This causes him to enter a 'Confused' state at night where he preys on other animals. Although he hasn't attacked any humans yet, as time passes he'll eventually degenerate to the point where he'll not only be confused during the day, but will become a mindless zombie seeking the flesh of any living thing just like feral zombies in movies. Rea has the same future to look forward to as well.

===Other characters===
;{{nihongo|Dan'ichirō Sanka|散華 団一郎|Sanka Dan'ichirō}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Unshō Ishizuka]]|[[David Wald]]}}
:Dan'ichirō is the overprotective father of Rea. His "love" for his daughter is almost incestuous, although he hadn't gotten to the point where he was having sex with her (at least not up to the point that she turned into a zombie). However, he had a habit of taking pictures of his daughter and having her watched whenever she left the mansion. On her birthdays he would take naked pictures of Rea claiming it was to 'note her development.' After facing Chihiro and Rea in his fencing room, he accepts Chihiro as Rea's protector but gives him a firm warning that there should be no "sexual intercourse before marriage". He heads to the US shortly thereafter to search for a way to stop Rea from decaying. His obsession with Rea seems to be a twisted form of the love he had for his first wife who died giving birth to Rea, and whom she greatly resembles. She had been one of the spectators at a Sanka endorsed fencing match and had complemented him for the skill he showed, even if the match had been set up. (He was angry that his opponents weren't fighting him seriously because the Sanka family had rigged the entire event to make him look good.){{Original research inline|date=August 2014|reason=cite sources that claim the incest}}

;{{nihongo|Aria Sanka|散華 亜里亜|Sanka Aria}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Mayumi Asano]]|[[Lydia Mackay]]}}
:Aria is Rea's stepmother. She used to be a maid for Dan'ichirō and was trained under a long-standing tradition in the Sanka family that future heirs are to marry the best of the maids. The maids were selected from good families and taught how to be ladies in areas such as deportment, grace, etc. so as to be suitable trophy wives if selected to marry into the family. Dan'ichirō however met and married Rea's mother whom he loved dearly until her death giving birth to Rea. Although Dan'ichirō subsequently married Aria, he did not pay her any attention instead watching over Rea, which made theirs a strained relationship at best. As a result she treated Rea coldly, tried to get Dan'ichirō interested in her, and was drunk most of the time when she wasn't working as Chairwoman of Rea's school. She secretly despises Rea due to how she's loved by everyone and is the sole object of Dan'ichirō's obession. She tried to seduce Chihiro after finding out Rea had turned into zombie, but she was coldly rejected with Chihiro telling her he only loves undead girls.

;{{nihongo|Darin Arciento Kurumiya|来宮・ダリン・アーシェント|Kurumiya Darin Āshento}}
:{{Voiced by|Aiko Kusumi|[[Jad Saxton]]}}
:Jogorō Furuya's former assistant, who wishes to use Rea as a research subject. She is vastly knowledgeable about zombies but her information is still inferior to the breadth Jogorō's knowledge, although the fact that she's more reliable than Jogorō (whose mind is deteriorating) creates a give-and-take relationship with both Chihiro and Rea. Her attitude slowly begins to change when Rea treats her as a friend. She has a modified zombie cyborg owl named {{nihongo|18|トワ|Towa}}. She also works for Jogorō's former organization, ZoMA. She became interested in Zombie Research because that was the only time her father ever paid any attention to her and not zombies. Her primary interest in Rea is to use her as a means of regaining her father's attention. However, due to a lack of empathy on his part, (along with severe psychological issues and insanity) she'll never be more important than his own obsessions. She is the first to realize that part of the reason Rea is able to hold onto her personality better than other zombies is that she ingested the Resurrection potion while she was still alive. All of the zombie test subjects that Darin had researched had been dead for at least a few hours before being given the potion. Despite looking and acting like a mature young woman she is only 14 years old. She also gives herself small doses of zombie poison to disable her limiters while remaining alive. As the doses are small they won't kill her or cause loss of vision and brain damage. A side effect of this treatment is that ability to feel pain is suppressed as well and she can damage herself without realizing it if she's not careful. As a result if she were to run at superhuman speeds, for example, she would not feel her leg muscles straining and not realize that anything was wrong until the damage was too great for her legs to function anymore.

In [[music]], '''solfège''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|s|ɒ|l|f|ɛ|dʒ}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Oxford Dictionaries|Solfège}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|s|ɒ|l|ˈ|f|ɛ|ʒ}}; {{IPA-fr|sɔlfɛʒ|lang}}) or '''solfeggio''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɒ|l|ˈ|f|ɛ|dʒ|i|oʊ}}; {{IPA-it|solˈfeddʒo|lang}}), also called '''sol-fa''', '''solfa''', '''solfeo''', among many names, is a [[music education]] method used to teach [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[Sight singing#Sight-singing|sight singing]] of [[Western classical music|Western music]]. Solfège is a form of [[solmization]], and though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, the systems used in other music cultures such as ''[[swara]]'', ''durar mufaṣṣalāt'' and ''[[Jianpu]]'' are discussed in their respective articles.

[[Syllable]]s are assigned to the notes of the scale and enable the musician to audiate, or mentally hear, the pitches of a piece of music which he or she is seeing for the first time and then to sing them aloud. Through the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] (and much later in some [[shapenote]] publications) various interlocking 4, 5 and 6-note systems were employed to cover the octave. The [[tonic sol-fa]] method popularized the seven syllables commonly used in English-speaking countries: ''do'' (or ''doh'' in [[tonic sol-fa]]),&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' 2nd Ed.(1998) {{page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''re'', ''mi'', ''fa'', ''so(l)'', ''la'', and ''si'' (or ''ti''), see [[Fixed do solfège|below]]).

There are two current ways of applying solfège: 1) [[#Fixed do solfège|fixed do]], where the syllables are always tied to specific pitches (e.g. "do" is always "C-natural") and 2) [[#Movable do solfège|movable do]], where the syllables are assigned to [[scale degree]]s ("do" is always the first degree of the [[major scale]]).

==Etymology==
[[Italian language|Italian]] "solfeggio" and English/French "solfège" derive from the names of two of the syllables used: ''sol'' and ''fa''.&lt;ref name="mw-solfeggio"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

The generic term "[[solmization]]", referring to any system of denoting pitches of a musical scale by syllables, including those used in India and Japan as well as solfège, comes from French ''solmisatio'', from the Latin solfège syllables ''sol'' and ''mi''.&lt;ref name="mw-solmization"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The verb "to sol-fa" means to sing a passage in solfège.&lt;ref name="mw-sol-fa"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
In eleventh-century [[Italy]], the music theorist [[Guido of Arezzo]] invented a notational system that named the six pitches of the [[hexachord]] after the first syllable of each line of the Latin [[hymn]] ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', the "Hymn to St. John the Baptist", yielding ''ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la''.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Davies, Norman (1997), ''Europe'', pp.271-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McNaught"/&gt; Each successive line of this hymn begins on the next [[scale degree]], so each pitch's name was the syllable sung at that pitch in this hymn.

[[Image:Ut Queant Laxis MT.png|thumb|Sheet Music for Ut Queant Laxis|386x386px]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Ut'''&lt;/u&gt; queant laxīs&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;'''re'''&lt;/u&gt;sonāre fībrīs
&lt;u&gt;'''Mī'''&lt;/u&gt;ra gestōrum&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;'''fa'''&lt;/u&gt;mulī tuōrum,
&lt;u&gt;'''Sol'''&lt;/u&gt;ve pollūtī&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;'''la'''&lt;/u&gt;biī reātum,
&lt;u&gt;'''S'''&lt;/u&gt;ancte &lt;u&gt;'''I'''&lt;/u&gt;ōhannēs.
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The words were written by [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the 8th century. They translate as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
So that your servants may,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;with loosened voices,
Resound the wonders&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of your deeds,
Clean the guilt&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;from our stained lips,
O St. John.
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Ut" was changed in the 1600s in Italy to the [[open syllable]] Do,&lt;ref name="McNaught"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; at the suggestion of the musicologue [[Giovanni Battista Doni]] (based on the first syllable of his surname), and Si (from the initials for "Sancte Iohannes") was added to complete the diatonic scale. In [[English people|Anglophone]] countries, "si" was changed to "ti" by [[Sarah Glover]] in the nineteenth century so that every syllable might [[Tonic sol-fa|begin with a different letter]].&lt;ref&gt;This also freed up Si for later use as Sol-sharp&lt;/ref&gt; "Ti" is used in [[tonic sol-fa]] (and in the famed American show tune "[[Do-Re-Mi]]").

An alternative theory argues that the solfège syllables (''do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti'') derive from the syllables of an [[Arabic music|Arabic]] solmization system درر مفصّلات ''Durar Mufaṣṣalāt'' ("Separated Pearls") ([[Arabic alphabet|''dāl, rā', mīm, fā', ṣād, lām, tā''']]), mentioned in the works of [[Francisci a Mesgnien Meninski]] in 1680 and later discussed by [[Jean-Benjamin de La Borde]] in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;''Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalum'' (1680) {{OCLC|61900507}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Essai sur la Musique Ancienne et Moderne'' (1780) {{OCLC|61970141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Farmer |first=Henry George |authorlink=Henry George Farmer |year=1988 |title=Historical facts for the Arabian Musical Influence |publisher=Ayer Publishing |isbn=0-405-08496-X |oclc=220811631 |pages=72–82 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Guido d'Arezzo: Medieval Musician and Educator |first=Samuel D. |last=Miller |journal=Journal of Research in Music Education |volume=21 |issue=3 |date=Autumn 1973 |pages=239–45 |doi=10.2307/3345093 |jstor=3345093 |publisher=MENC_ The National Association for Music Education |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no documentary evidence for this theory.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1973, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Elizabethan England==

In the [[Elizabethan era]], England and its related territories used only four of the syllables: mi, fa, sol, and la. "Mi" stood for modern si, "fa" for modern do or ut, "sol" for modern re, and "la" for modern mi. Then, fa, sol and la would be repeated to also stand for their modern counterparts, resulting in the scale being "fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa". The use of "fa", "sol" and "la" for two positions in the scale is a leftover from the Guidonian system of so-called "mutations" (i.e. changes of hexachord on a note, see [[Guidonian hand]]). This system was largely eliminated by the 19th century, but is still used in some [[shape note]] systems, which give each of the four syllables "fa", "sol", "la", and "mi" a different shape.

An example of this type of solmization occurs in Shakespeare's ''King Lear'', I, 2 (see {{slink||Cultural references}}).

==Modern use==
There are two main types of solfège ''[[#Movable do solfège|Movable do]]'' and ''[[#Fixed do solfège|Fixed Do]]''.

===Movable do solfège===
In ''Movable do'', or ''tonic sol-fa'', each syllable corresponds to a [[scale degree]]. This is analogous to the Guidonian practice of giving each degree of the hexachord a solfège name, and is mostly used in Germanic countries, [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Countries, and the United States.

One particularly important variant of movable do, but differing in some respects from the system described below, was invented in the nineteenth century by [[Sarah Ann Glover]], and is known as [[tonic sol-fa]].

In Italy, in 1972, [[Roberto Goitre]] wrote the famous method "Cantar leggendo", which has come to be used for choruses and for music for young children.

The pedagogical advantage of the movable-Do system is its ability to assist in the theoretical understanding of music; because a tonic is established and then sung in comparison to, the student infers melodic and chordal implications through his or her singing. Thus, while fixed-do is more applicable to instrumentalists, movable-do is more applicable to theorists and, arguably, composers.

====Major====
Movable do is frequently employed in [[Australia]], [[China]], [[Japan]] (with 5th being so,and 7th being si), [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Hong Kong]], and English-speaking Canada. The movable do system is a fundamental element of the [[Kodály method]] used primarily in [[Hungary]], but with a dedicated following worldwide. In the movable do system, each solfège syllable corresponds not to a pitch, but to a scale degree: The first degree of a major scale is always sung as "do", the second as "re", etc. (For minor keys, see below.) In movable do, a given tune is therefore always sol-faed on the same syllables, no matter what key it is in.

The solfège syllables used for movable do differ slightly from those used for fixed do, because the English variant of the basic syllables ("ti" instead of "si") is usually used, and chromatically altered syllables are usually included as well.

If, at a certain point, the key of a piece modulates, then it is necessary to change the solfège syllables at that point. For example, if a piece begins in C major, then C is initially sung on "do", D on "re", etc. If, however, the piece then modulates to G major, then G is sung on "do", A on "re", etc., and C is then sung on "fa".

====Minor====
Passages in a minor key may be sol-faed in one of two ways in movable do: either starting on do (using "me", "le", and "te" for the lowered third, sixth, and seventh degrees, and "la" and "ti" for the raised sixth and seventh degrees), which is referred to as "do-based minor", or starting on la (using "fi" and "si" for the raised sixth and seventh degrees). The latter (referred to as "la-based minor") is sometimes preferred in choral singing, especially with children.

The choice of which system is used for minor makes a difference as to how you handle modulations. In the first case ("do-based minor"), when the key moves for example from C major to C minor the syllable do keeps pointing to the same note, namely C, (there's no "mutation" of do's note), but when the key shifts from C major to A minor (or A major), the scale is transposed from do = C to do = A. In the second case ("la-based minor"), when the key moves from C major to A minor the syllable do keeps point to the same note, again C, but when the key moves from C major to C minor the scale is transposed from do = C to do = E-flat.

===Fixed do solfège===
[[Image:French keyboard.png|right|250px|thumb|The names of the notes in Romance languages.]]

In ''Fixed do'', each syllable corresponds to the name of a note. This is analogous to the Romance system naming pitches after the solfège syllables, and is used in Romance and Slavic countries, among others, including Spanish speaking countries.

In the major [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] languages, the syllables Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, and
Si are used to name notes the same way that the letters C, D, E, F, G, A, and B are used to name notes in English. For native speakers of these languages, solfège is simply ''singing the names of the notes'', omitting any modifiers such as "sharp" or "flat" in order to preserve the rhythm. This system is called '''fixed do''' and is used in [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], [[Romania]], [[Latin America]]n countries and in French-speaking Canada as well as countries such as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]], [[Armenia]], [[Albania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Iran]], [[Taiwan]], [[Middle East]], [[Turkey]], and [[Israel]] where non-Romance languages are spoken. In the United States of America, the fixed-do system is principally taught at The [[Juilliard School]] in New York City and the [[Curtis Institute]] of Music in Philadelphia.

{{Traditional fixed do}}

In the fixed do system, shown above, accidentals do not affect the syllables used. For example, C, C{{music|sharp}}, and C{{music|flat}} (as well as {{nowrap|C{{music|doublesharp}}}} and {{nowrap|C{{music|doubleflat}}}}, not shown above) are all sung with the syllable "do".

====Chromatic variants====
Several chromatic fixed-do Systems that have also been devised to account for chromatic notes (and even for double-sharp and double-flat variants) are as follows:

=== Comparison of the two systems ===

Movable Do corresponds to our psychological experience of normal tunes.  If the song is sung a tone higher it is still perceived to be the same song, and the notes have the same relationship to each other, but in a fixed Do all the note names would be different. A movable Do emphasizes the musicality of the tune as the psychological perception of the notes is always relative to a key for the vast majority of people that do not have absolute pitch.

Sotorrio&lt;ref&gt;Sotorrio, José A (2002). ''Tone Spectra -and the Natural Elements of Music''. (1st Ed) Spectral Music, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that fixed-do is preferable for serious musicians, as music involving complex modulations and vague tonality is often too ambiguous with regard to key for any movable system. That is, without a prior analysis of the music, any movable-do system would inevitably need to be used like a fixed-do system anyway, thus causing confusion. With fixed-do, the musician learns to regard any syllable as the tonic, which does not force them to make an analysis as to which note is the tonic when ambiguity occurs. Instead, with fixed-do the musician will already be practiced in thinking in multiple/undetermined tonalities using the corresponding syllables.

In comparison to the movable do system, which draws on short-term [[relative pitch]] skills involving comparison to a pitch identified as the tonic of the particular piece being performed, fixed do develops long-term relative pitch skills involving comparison to a pitch defined independently of its role in the piece, a practice closer to the definition of each note in absolute terms as found in [[absolute pitch]].  The question of which system to use is a controversial subject among music educators in schools in the United States. While movable do is easier to teach and learn, some feel that fixed do leads to stronger sight-reading and better [[ear training]] because students learn the relationships between specific pitches as defined independently, rather than only the function of intervals within melodic lines, chords, and chord progressions.&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, Lee. [http://www.thinkingapplied.com/sight-singing_folder/sight-singing.pdf ''Learning to Sight-Sing: The Mental Mechanics of Aural Imagery.''] Minneapolis: Thinking Applied, 2008, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, this argument is only valid if the fixed do is used with chromatic solfège syllables.

If a performer has been trained using fixed do, particularly in those rare cases in which the performer has [[absolute pitch]] or well-developed long-term relative pitch, the performer may have difficulty playing music scored for [[transposing instruments]]: Because the "[[concert pitch]]" note to be performed differs from the note written in the sheet music, the performer may experience [[cognitive dissonance]] when having to read one note and play another. Especially in the early stages of learning a piece, when the performer has yet to gain familiarity with the melodic line of the piece as expressed in relative terms, he or she may have to mentally re-transpose the sheet music in order to restore the notes to concert pitch.

Those trained in fixed-do will argue that their act is the analogue of reading aloud in a language. Just as one reads this very sentence without parsing it grammatically, so too fixed-do is the direct sounding of the music. Where the movable-do system requires constant real-time analysis of the tonality and modulations in the score, in fixed-do the musician uses knowledge of the changing tonality to understand for example that the pitch class c-natural is the supertonic in B-Flat major or minor, and the dominant when the music modulates to F-major, but the c-note remains the same pitch.

Instrumentalists who begin [[sight-singing]] for the first time in college as music majors find movable do to be the system more consistent with the way they learned to read music.

For choirs, sight-singing fixed do using chromatic movable do syllables (see below) is more suitable than sight-singing movable do for reading [[atonal]] music, [[polytonal]] music, [[pandiatonic]] music, music that modulates or changes key often, or music in which the composer simply did not bother to write a [[key signature]]. It is not uncommon for this to be the case in modern or contemporary choral works.

==Note names==

In the countries with fixed-do, these seven syllables (with Si instead of Ti) are used to name the notes of the C-Major scale, instead of the letters C, D, E, F, G, A and B. (For example, they would say, "Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] is in Re minor, but its third movement is in [[B-flat major|Si-bemol major]].") In [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] countries, the letters are used for this purpose, and the solfège syllables are encountered only for their use in sight-singing and ear training. (They would say, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is in "d-Moll" (D minor).)

[[Image:Curwen Hand Signs MT.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[John Curwen]]'s [[Solfege]] hand signs used in [[Tonic sol-fa]]. This version includes the tonal tendencies and interesting titles for each tone.]]

===Rainbow Colors assigned by Isaac Newton===

[[Isaac Newton]]{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} had associated the seven solfège syllables with the seven colors of the [[rainbow]] and surmised that each color vibrated accordingly (a concept possibly related to the modern view of [[chromesthesia]]). Thus, red has the least amount of vibration while violet vibrates the most.

==Cultural references==
*The various possibilities to distinguish the notes acoustically, optically and by ways of speech and [[signed language|signs]] made the '''Solfège'' a possible [[syllabary]] for an [[International Auxiliary Language]] (IAL/LAI). This was, in the latter half of the [[19th century]], realised in the musical language [[Solresol]].

*In [[King Lear]] (Act 1, Scene 2) [[Edmund (King Lear)|Edmund]] exclaims to himself right after Edgar's entrance so that Edgar can hear him: "''O, these eclipses do portend these divisions''". Then in the 1623 [[First Folio]] (but not in the 1608 Quarto) he adds "''Fa, so, la, mi''". This Edmund probably sang (see [[#Solmization in Elizabethan England|Elizabethan solmisation]]) to the tune of ''Fa'', ''So'', ''La'', ''Ti'' (e.g. F, G, A, B in C major), i.e. an ascending sequence of three whole tones with an ominous feel to it: see [[tritone#Historical uses|tritone (historical uses)]].

*In ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', the song "[[Do-Re-Mi]]" is built around solfège.  Maria sings it with the von Trapp children to teach them to sing the major scale.

&lt;!--Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. Please do not add personal recipes for stain removal without citing.--&gt;
A '''stain''' is a discoloration that can be clearly distinguished from the surface, material, or medium it is found upon. They are caused by the chemical or physical interaction of two dissimilar materials. Staining is used for [[staining (biology)|biochemical research]], metal staining, and [[art]] (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[wood staining]], [[stained glass]]).

==Types==
There can be intentional stains (such as [[wood]] stains or [[paint]]),&lt;ref name="stainbook"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Understanding Wood Finishing: How to Select and Apply the Right Finish | author = Bob Flexner | journal = Reader's Digest | date = 1999 | pages = 121 | isbn = 978-0-7621-0191-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicative stains (such as [[food coloring]] or adding a substance to make [[bacteria]] visible under a [[microscope]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Staining Procedures Used by the Biological Stain Commission: Published for the Biological Stain Commission | author = George Clark, James W. Bartholomew | publisher = Williams &amp; Wilkins | date = 1981 | pages = 32–33 | isbn = 978-0-683-01707-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; natural stains (such as [[rust]] on iron or a [[patina]] on [[bronze]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Architectural Metals: A Guide to Selection, Specification, and Performance | author = [[L. William Zahner]] | publisher = Wiley | date = 1997 | page = 101 | isbn = 978-0-471-04506-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accidental stains such as [[ketchup]] on a shirt.

Different types of material can be stained by different substances, and stain resistance is an important characteristic in modern [[textile engineering]].

==Formation==
The primary method of stain formation is surface stains, where the staining substance is spilled out onto the surface or material and is trapped in the fibers, pores, indentations, or other capillary structures on the surface.&lt;ref name="stainbook" /&gt; The material that is trapped coats the underlying material, and the stain reflects back light according to its own color. Applying paint, spilled food, and wood stains are of this nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Materials Performance | author = NACE International | publisher = National Association of Corrosion Engineers | date = 1987 | volume = 26 | page = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A secondary method of stain involves a [[chemical reaction|chemical]] or molecular reaction between the material and the staining material. Many types of natural stains fall into this category.

Finally, there can also be molecular attraction between the material and the staining material, involving being held in a [[covalent bond]] and showing the color of the bound substance.&lt;ref name="stainbook2"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Stain Removal Handbook | author = Max Alth, Simon Alth | publisher = Hawthorn Books | date = 1977 | page = 22 | isbn = 978-0-8015-7071-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
In many cases, stains are affected by [[heat]] and may become reactive enough to bond with the underlying material. Extreme heat, such as from [[ironing]] or [[dry cleaning]], can cause a chemical reaction on an otherwise removable stain, turning it into a chemical compound that is impossible to remove.&lt;ref name="stainbook2" /&gt;

==Removal==
Various [[laundry]] techniques exist to attempt to remove or minimize existing stains, and [[Stain removal|stain remover]]s are an important type of chemical in [[laundry detergent]]s. Some stand-alone stain removers also exist. If the wrong technique is used to remove the stain or stain mark on the clothing it could actually cause permanent damage to the clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laundrycares.com/laundry-stain-removal/ Solutions for Clothing and Laundry Stain Removal]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30397">'''Territory bands''' were dance bands that crisscrossed specific regions of the United States from the 1920s through the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Schuller 770-805"/&gt;  Beginning in the 1920s, the bands typically had 8 to 12 musicians.  These bands typically played one-nighters, 6 or 7 nights a week at venues like [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|VFW]] halls, [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Lodge]]s, [[Lions Club]]s, hotel ballrooms, and the like.  [[Francis Davis]], jazz critic for [[The Village Voice]], likened territory bands to "the [[Top 40]] [[cover bands]] (of the 1970s and 1980s) of their day, typically relying on stock arrangements of other ensembles' hits."  He said, "many historians give much credit to territory bands for popularizing modern [[ballroom dancing]] that began during the [[World War I]] era with the influence of [[Vernon Castle|Vernon and Irene Castle]]."&lt;ref name="Village Voice 2006"/&gt;

Territory bands helped disseminate popular music &amp;mdash; which included swing, jazz, sweet dance music, or any combination thereof &amp;mdash; bringing it to remote gin mills and dance halls that were otherwise ignored by national booking agents representing genuine recording stars like [[Duke Ellington|Ellington]] and [[Louie Armstrong|Armstrong]]. Many developed original repertoires and signature sounds, none more storied than [[Walter Page]]'s [[Oklahoma City Blue Devils|Blue Devils]], the Oklahoma City-based outfit that [[Count Basie]] joined in 1926.&lt;ref name="Village Voice 2006"/&gt;

== Ethnicities of the bands ==
There were black bands and white bands, and bands of various immigrant ethnicities.&lt;ref name="Greene 1992"/&gt; There were also all-female bands, such as the [[International Sweethearts of Rhythm]].

Musician, composer, and scholar [[Gunther Schuller]] asserted in one of his books, ''The Swing Era: The Development of Jazz, 1930–1945 (The History of Jazz, Vol. 2)'' that, "territory bands, by definition, were black.  There were, of course, many white bands in the 'territories' but they tended to have the more lucrative and permanent jobs and therefore not required to travel as much as the black bands."&lt;ref name="Schuller 770-805" /&gt; Another musician (former territory band musician and historian), [[Jack Behrens]], expressed in a book that Schuller's depiction of divergent work conditions was narrow.  "During my playing days in the 1940s and 50s in several white territory bands, we didn't have "lucrative and permanent jobs" unless you count day labor in a dairy bar or clerking at a military surplus store.  Worse, there were times we didn't get paid at all and we had little recourse given the cost of legal advice."&lt;ref name="Behrens"/&gt;

For most territory bands &amp;mdash; whether black, white, integrated, male, female &amp;mdash; the musicians were nearly always paid. Neither the booking agencies nor the musicians got rich, but regular salaries helped maintain pretty decent musicianship.&lt;ref name="Dirk Fischer"/&gt;

Most musicians witnessed and experienced a wide variety of [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] practices, from city to city and region to region.  One common present-day misconception is that Jim Crow practices were more prevalent in the South.  The practices were prevalent everywhere, especially in New York City&lt;ref name="Fronc"/&gt; and the Midwest.  The bands that were racially integrated commonly experienced problems, mostly from having to dodge different applications and degrees of Jim Crow among cities and regions.  Many bands, especially The [[International Sweethearts of Rhythm]], handled some of the absurdities with a degree of inward, sarcastic humor.  When musicians grew wary or even felt vulnerable to injustices of Jim Crow, the band bus, for those who had one, served as a safe haven.

==History==
The published history of territory bands is thin.  Most of what we know comes from fading memories and second-hand anecdotes.  With a lack of discography and the passing of a generation, our knowledge is slipping. While many territory bands were of high quality, they rarely recorded and were often unfairly considered minor league to the national touring bands.  Moreover, they were confined to specific regions or states … even parts of a state.&lt;ref name="Behrens" /&gt;  Ambitious and hopeful young musicians saw territory bands as a training ground for, or rite of passage to, the major big bands.  The alumni of territory band musicians who matriculated to fame within the industry reads like list of "who's who" in music.

Territory bands typically played more sweet music, though, some in the mid 1950s, particularly those with talented musicians, managed to entertain dancers with a jazzier sound.  But dancing audiences are what kept the bands employed.  In the 1920s, territory bands commonly traveled by car ([[station wagon]]), followed by an equipment truck for the [[PA system]], [[guitar amplifier]]s and [[drum kit]].  Later, beginning in the mid-1930s, territory bands commonly traveled in sleeper trailers.

== Established territories ==
Home territories were loosely defined, but some classifications emerged. Generally, the areas were defined as Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, West Coast, Southwest and Northwest. In addition, some state-groupings became common.

; MINK
MINK was a particularly distinguished state group. It was composed of [[Minnesota]], [[Iowa]], [[Nebraska]] and [[Kansas]].

; VSA 
VSA was composed of [[Virginia]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Alabama]].&lt;ref name="TB DB"/&gt;

; Southwest
The [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] proved especially fertile for territory bands.  [[Texas]], with its spread-out geography and relatively large population, offered the greatest opportunity with developed markets for dance music in [[Dallas-Fort Worth]], [[Houston, TX|Houston]], [[San Antonio]], [[Austin, TX|Austin]], [[Amarillo]], and other cities.  The homegrown audiences of Texas bands were so plentiful that the bands developed to a high degree in relative isolation from outside influences.&lt;ref name="Gioia"/&gt;  One such band was that of [[Alphonso Trent]].

; West Coast
Bands out of Los Angeles and Seattle performed not only in California, Oregon, and Washington, but also Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana.  The Glenn Henry Orchestra, which got its first big break playing summers at Yellowstone Park from 1935 to 1940, became a popular West Coast territory band.

; Military circuits
There were military territories, too — [[Non-commissioned officer#United States|NCO]] Clubs, Officers' Clubs.  These clubs took bands to [[Greenland]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Bermuda]], [[Puerto Rico]], as well as the US.

==Styles==
The musicians in the territory dance bands were primarily jazz musicians. Despite the overwhelming view that [[New Orleans]] was the cradle of jazz, the itinerant musicians were the ones who first disseminated it.

The dancing public could actually dance and they knew which bands swung and which simply just played well.  Audiences responded with great enthusiasm to the black bands in the Midwest. The East Coast black bands were popular in the 1920s; but "Swing" came to that region in the form of [[Louis Armstrong]] joining the [[Fletcher Henderson]] band when he went to the [[New York City|Big Apple]].

Territory bands were not all swing bands. The Midwest settlements of Europeans of various ethnicities brought their community dancing and revelry with them in the form of very popular polka bands (and also old time [[waltzes]], leandlers, and [[schottische]]s).&lt;ref name="Greene 1992"/&gt;  They played at all the ballrooms, Elk Clubs, and the like as well.  Here's a short exemplary list:

:[http://www.internationalpolka.com/fritsche.htm Fezz Fritsche] &amp; His Goose-town Band
:The [[Six Fat Dutchmen]]
:The Babe Wagner Band (Babe later played jazz trombone with the [[Gene Krupa|Krupa]] band)
:[http://www.whoopeejohn.com/ Whoopie John] &amp;mdash; a very successful and famous polka band from Minneapolis

==Pre 1920s==
There were traveling bands well before the 1920s &amp; 30s.  One of many examples were musicians who did their booking from [[Redfield, South Dakota]]. Redfield was a railroad hub in the [[Northern Plains]]. All their booking was up and down the rail line.

==1920s &amp;mdash; swing and ballroom dancing==
In 1924, according to [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], there were more than 900 dance bands, representing steady work for 7,200 musicians.  There were 68 [[Paul Whiteman|Whiteman]] orchestras across the country, playing music from the Whiteman library, eleven in New York alone.  In the mid-20s, bands typically had ten musicians: two [[alto saxophone|altos]], one [[tenor saxophone|tenor]] (who often doubled on other [[woodwinds]] and sometimes [[violin]]), two [[trumpet]]s, [[trombone]], [[banjo]] or [[guitar]], [[piano]], [[string bass]] or [[tuba|brass bass]], and drums.  Sometimes there were two trombones.  If the band had only two saxophones, they would be alto and tenor.

==1933 &amp;mdash; Great Depression==
The [[Great Depression]], which hit bottom in 1933, was hard on territory bands.  The public strained to afford entertainment.  It was not uncommon for bands to be stranded for lack of funds.  Many broke up during this period.

==1940s &amp;mdash; decline ==
There are many theories on why swing music and territory bands declined.  Here are a few:
#Unions restricted the fees of booking agents and managers.
#Unions required visiting bands to pay local musicians for displaced work (in small towns, unions were nonexistent; but in large cities, unions often looked askance upon territory bands).
#Popularity of small combos
#Commercial Radio (introduced in 1922), better-quality gramophone discs, and TV (giving greater access to entertainment in the home and access to different types of music).  Changing technology (radio, TV, mobility, amplified music) shocked the music industry in a similar way that the [[internet]] has shocked the recording industry today.
#In the 1950s, most ballrooms in smaller towns of the Midwest closed because people could drive to the city for everything.
#Record companies discovered &amp;mdash; during the AFM recording bans of 1942-43 and 1948 — that they could profit from record sales, churning out [[Hit Parade]] music with just singers, who were exempt from the recording bans.  This marked a period when singers became more popular than bandleaders.  The introduction and technological advancement of amplification and gramophone recording led to the development of [[crooning]], an intimate vocal style perfected by singers such as [[Bing Crosby]] and, later, [[Frank Sinatra]].  The record companies gained control over what got recorded; therefore music that was slated for a new market of teenagers was born.  This destroyed several booking agencies. [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]], who broke up as many bands as it booked, moved to [[Hollywood]]. Frederic Bros. ([[Chicago]]) had a fallout with several of its bands.&lt;ref name="Billboard 1948"/&gt;  The Vic Schroeder Agency (Omaha), was one of the more responsible bookers before [[World War II]] but, little is known after &amp;mdash; same with the White Agency.&lt;ref name="Dirk Fischer"/&gt;
#Amplification also led to the introduction of the [[electric guitar]], which enabled a very small band to project adequately in large-room settings.  Bear in mind that, in the 1920s, an unamplified orchestra had to be large enough and play loud enough to entertain a dance hall of 3,000. Prior to the recording bans, the industry was bent on capturing the intent of composers as interpreted by musicians.  Before the ban, gramophone consumers were primarily interested in authenticity of symphonies and famous orchestras (dance bands).  Vocals, with no microphones, were only an incidental part of an arrangement. Vocals &amp;mdash; like Bing Crosby's with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra in the studio — could not be replicated live, on stage.  [[Rudy Vallée]] used a cheerleader's [[megaphone]]. Amplification and the record industry helped spur technical improvements, at the expense of performing musicians.

==All-girl territory bands==
In the history of traveling dance bands, all female bands are often excluded, or only given minor inclusion. Popular culture seemed to regard the musical performances dance bands provided as an area meant to be dominated by men. In the scenarios where women were allowed to join in, they were often denoted as separate. This is seen in the way many female singers were nicknamed “canaries,” denoting them not as musicians, but as pretty objects meant to be on display.  One example that shows just how foreign women could be considered appears in the name of a band [[Mary Lou Williams]] headed that was called "Six Men and a Girl."&lt;ref name="Antoinette"/&gt; Oftentimes these stereotypes surrounding performing women extended to instrumentalists.

All female performers were not a new idea in the dawn of traveling jazz bands though. All women groups performing American genres of music dates back to minstrel groups like Madame Rentz’s Female Minstrels. Because women could not easily enter prestigious music bands that were essentially all male, all women groups continuously popped up as groups that allowed skilled female musicians to perform. Sometimes they were put together with help from outside sources. It was not uncommon for a group to be put together by a man or a talent agency, but to consist of all female performers. Sometimes performers received aide from family or friends involved in the business to help get their foot in the door. For instance, [[Lil Hardin Armstrong]] had an all woman dance band in the early 1930s.  This group went by such names as "Lil Armstrong and Her Swing Band."&lt;ref name="Dahl"/&gt;  Other bands popular in the 1930s include [[The Harlem Playgirls]], The Dixie Sweethearts, the [[Darlings of Rhythm]], and Gertrude Long and Her Rambling Night Hawks.&lt;ref name="Antoinette"/&gt;

Even banding together with other women though, public perception would sometimes view all female bands as “all-girl gimmicks.” Some talented musicians avoided joining all female bands in the fear that their talent would be disregarded in such a context.&lt;ref name="Dahl"/&gt;  Yet all female bands were also forced into the feminine appearances they were also demeaned for. In many ways, this made being in a traveling dance band more difficult for women than it had been for men. After a night spent traveling women were expected to be visions of beauty with perfect make up, hair, and personalities. Often the ultra feminine clothes they had to wear, such as strapless dress and high heels, also affected their ability to play and perform. As had been shown in previous attempts women had made to broach men’s groups, attempting to break away from this dainty female image could call the sexuality and morality of a performer into question. Yet women’s performances were also often debased to their visual looks and sexual attractiveness, even though many reviewers criticized them for these elements.&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt;

A certain need to prove themselves seemed to exist among many of the female musicians who worked in dance bands. These performers inherited a lot of the stereotypes that surrounded their previous female performer counterparts: chorus line girls and girl singers. The sexual objectification of women that haunted those two careers was also a part of being in an all female band. Furthermore, chorus line girls had an association with loose morals and even prostitution, and loss of face for an instrumentalist could mean the end of a career.  These kinds of associations also made many people assume that female instrumentalists were not talented players. Upon interviewing later in life, many women insisted that they were talented musicians who knew how to play. This insistence seems to be in direct reaction to the claims that circulated that female musicians were not meant to play well but simply to look pretty. While it’s true that many agencies required photos in their applications to join female bands, the musicians in them still tended to be quite talented.&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt;

While many people view the end of the Swing era as the opening of World War II, this was not the case for all woman dance bands. Instead, they flourished during the 1940s. Swing music became a form of patriotism to a country at war. The all-girl bands that did the best at this time tended to be groups formed before American involvement in the war. Once it was realized that women could fill a major hole in the entertainment industry and that they could not be drafted, agencies and managers everywhere began trying to put together all female bands. In many ways, these musicians were very prepared to take over for the men because they had more advanced experience in playing instruments, either from hobbies or school bands. They were certainly more prepared for musical performance than many women were prepared for welding and factory work. Some groups connected to academic organizations, such as the [[International Sweethearts of Rhythm]] or the [[Prairie View Co-eds]] did very well at this time. These groups of industrious young women could come to represent an image of what the United States was at war for. Some of these groups even did USO tours. Soldiers shipped off to foreign lands, under the pressure war and deprived of any female presence were more than welcoming to these all woman groups. The armed audiences were known to have shown extreme appreciation for these female performers&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt;  [[V-discs]], recorded for broadcast on the Armed Forces Radio Network, often featured all-girl groups.

'''''The Complete Compleat Enchanter''''' is an omnibus collection of five  [[fantasy]] stories by Ametican authors [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Fletcher Pratt]], gathering material previously published in three volumes as ''[[The Incomplete Enchanter]]'' (1941), ''[[The Castle of Iron]]'' (1950), and ''[[Wall of Serpents]]'' (1960), and represents an expansion of the earlier omnibus ''[[The Compleat Enchanter]]'', which contained only the material in the first two volumes. The expanded version also differs from the previous omnibus by omitting its afterword, de Camp's essay "Fletcher and I". The omnibus is the first edition of the authors' [[Harold Shea]] series to be complete in one volume. It has appeared under three different titles.  It was first published in the UK in paperback by [[Sphere Books]] in 1988 under the title ''The Intrepid Enchanter'' and with a foreword by [[Catherine Crook de Camp]].  The first US edition appeared under the title ''The Complete Compleat Enchanter'', and replaces the foreword with a preface by [[David Drake]].  That edition was published by [[Baen Books]] in 1989, and has been reprinted a number of times since.  [[Orion Books]] published an edition in the UK under the title ''The Compleat Enchanter'' in 2000 as volume 10 of their [[Fantasy Masterworks]] series.  The stories in the collection were originally published in magazine form in the May 1940, August 1940 and April 1941 issues of ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'', the June 1953 issue of ''[[Beyond Fantasy]]'', and the October 1954 issue of ''[[Fantasy Fiction (magazine)|Fantasy]]''.

The Harold Shea stories are [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] tales in which universes where magic works coexist with our own, and in which those based on the mythologies, legends, and literary fantasies of our world and can be reached by aligning one's mind to them by a system of symbolic logic. Psychologist Harold Shea and his colleagues Reed Chalmers, Walter Bayard and Vaclav Polacek (Votsy), travel to several such worlds, joined in the course of their adventures by Belphebe and Florimel of Faerie, who become the wives of Shea and Chalmers, and Pete Brodsky, a policeman who is accidentally swept up into  the chaos. The five stories collected in ''The Complete Compleat Enchanter'' explore the worlds of [[Norse mythology]] in "The Roaring Trumpet", [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' in "The Mathematics of Magic", [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (with a brief stop in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[Kubla Khan]]'') in "The Castle of Iron", the ''[[Kalevala]]'' in "The Wall of Serpents", and [[Irish mythology]] in "The Green Magician".

==Plot==
A British [[ghostwriter]] ([[Ewan McGregor]]) is hired by the [[Publishing|publishing firm]] Rhinehart, Inc., to complete the autobiography of former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] Adam Lang ([[Pierce Brosnan]]). His predecessor and Lang's aide, Mike McAra, has recently died in an apparent drowning accident. The writer travels to Old Haven on [[Martha's Vineyard]], [[Massachusetts]], where Lang and his wife Ruth ([[Olivia Williams]]) are staying, along with Lang's personal assistant (and implied mistress), Amelia Bly ([[Kim Cattrall]]). Amelia forbids the writer from taking McAra's [[Manuscript format|manuscript]] outside, emphasising that it is a security risk.

Shortly after the writer's arrival, former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] Richard Rycart ([[Robert Pugh]]) accuses Lang of authorising the [[extraordinary rendition|illegal seizure]] of suspected terrorists and handing them over for [[torture]] by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], a possible [[war crime]]. Lang faces prosecution by the [[International Criminal Court]] unless he stays in the US (or one of the few other countries that does not recognise the court's jurisdiction). While Lang is in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], the writer finds items in McAra's room suggesting he might have stumbled across a dark secret. Among them is an envelope containing photographs and a phone number the writer discovers is Rycart's.

During a bike ride, the writer encounters an old man ([[Eli Wallach]]) who tells him the current couldn't have taken McAra's body from the ferry where he disappeared to the beach where it was discovered. He also reveals a neighbour saw flashlights on the beach the night McAra died, but later fell down the stairs and went into a coma. Later, Ruth admits to the writer Lang had never been very political, and until recently always took her advice. When he tells her the old man's story, she suddenly rushes out into the rainy night to "clear her head." Upon returning, she reveals Lang and McAra had argued the night before the latter's death, and the ghost writer and Ruth have a [[one night stand]] while Adam is away.

The next morning, the writer takes the [[BMW X5 (E70)|BMW X5]]&lt;ref&gt;2009 BMW X5 xDrive30d [E70] in The Ghost Writer, Movie, 2010 http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_325926-BMW-X5-E70-2009.html&lt;/ref&gt; McAra used on his last journey. Unable to cancel the pre-programmed directions on the car's [[Satellite navigation|sat-nav]], he decides to follow them. He arrives in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]] at the home of Professor Paul Emmett ([[Tom Wilkinson]]). Emmett denies anything more than a cursory acquaintance with Lang, despite the writer showing him two pictures of the pair among photographs found in McAra's possessions, as well as another on the wall of Emmett's study. When the writer tells Emmett the sat-nav proves McAra visited him the night he died, Emmett denies meeting McAra and becomes evasive. The writer leaves, and successfully eludes a car that is pursuing him. He boards the ferry back to Martha's Vineyard, but when he sees the pursuit car drive aboard, he flees the boat at the last moment and checks into a small motel by the ferry dock.

With no one else to turn to, the writer redials Rycart's number, asking for help. While waiting, the writer does research on Emmett and links his [[think tank]] to a [[Arms industry|military contractor]]. He also finds leads connecting Emmett to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. When Rycart arrives, he reveals McAra [[News leak|gave him]] documents linking Lang to so-called "torture flights," where terrorist suspects were placed on private jets owned by Emmett's company, to be tortured while airborne.

Rycart further claims that McAra found new evidence, which he wrote about in the "beginning" of the manuscript. The men cannot, however, find anything in the early pages. The writer discusses Emmett's relationship with Lang, while Rycart recounts how Lang's decisions as Prime Minister uniformly benefited US interests. When the writer is summoned to accompany Lang on his return flight by private jet, he confronts Lang and accuses him of being a CIA agent recruited by Emmett. Lang derides his suggestions.

Upon leaving the aircraft, Lang is assassinated by a British [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] protester, who is in turn shot by Lang's bodyguards. Nevertheless, the writer is asked to complete the book for posthumous publication, as in light of Lang's death it will be a certain best-seller. Amelia invites him to the book's launch party in London, where she unwittingly tells him the Americans tightened access to the book, as the "beginnings" contained evidence threatening national security. She also tells him Emmett, who is in attendance, was Ruth's tutor when she was a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright scholar]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]].

The writer realizes the clues were hidden in the original manuscript in the opening words of each paragraph, and discovers the message: "Lang's wife Ruth was recruited as a CIA agent by Professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University." He concludes Ruth shaped Lang's every political decision to benefit the USA under direction from the CIA.

The writer passes a note to Ruth revealing his discovery. She unfolds the note, and is devastated. When she sees the writer raising a glass, she is kept from following him by Emmett and other assistants. As the writer leaves the party he attempts to take a taxi, without success. As he crosses the street off-camera, a car accelerates in his direction to an impending collision. As witnesses react in horror, the pages containing McAra's manuscript are blowing in the wind, leaving the writer's fate unconfirmed.

Pierce Brosnan plays the character of Adam Lang, who has echoes of former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]. The character is linked to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the [[war on terror]] and the [[Special Relationship|special relationship with the United States]]. The author of the book on which the film is based has said he was inspired at least in part by anger at Mr Blair's policies, and calls for him to face war crimes trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Barbara Plett]]|date=19 March 2010|  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8576156.stm|title=How Realistic Is New Polanski Film The Ghost?|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate= 5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Pugh, who portrayed the British Foreign Secretary, Richard Rycart, and Mo Asumang, who played the US Secretary of State, both physically resemble their real-life counterparts, [[Robin Cook]] and [[Condoleezza Rice]]. Like the fictional Rycart, Cook had foreign policy differences with the British Prime Minister. The old man living on Martha's Vineyard is a reference to [[Robert McNamara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/18/the-ghost-roman-polanski-review

|quote=''Oddly, as co-adaptors, Polanski and Harris have played down a character carefully signalled in the book. In the film, the 94-year-old Eli Wallach plays an elderly Vineyard resident who gives the ghost writer some vital information concerning the cove where the previous writer's corpse washed up. In the novel, he is clearly identified as the former secretary of state Robert McNamara by his rimless glasses and hairstyle, his statement about war crimes ("We could all have been charged with those. Maybe we should have been.") and a reference to a real event in 1972: "Hell, a guy tried to throw me off that damn ferry when I was still at the World Bank." This explains Harris's curious, ludic choice of the name McAra for the original ghost in the novel.''|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hatherton Corporation alludes to real-life Halliburton.

==Production==
Polanski had originally teamed with Robert Harris for a film of Harris's novel ''[[Pompeii (novel)|Pompeii]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117958517?refCatId=13 Variety 1 February 2007: Polanski propels 'Pompeii']. Retrieved 30 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; but the project was cancelled because of the looming actors' strike that autumn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1670046/roman_polanski_flees_pompeii/ Rotten Tomatoes 12 September 2007: Roman Polanski Flees Pompeii].

Polanski and Harris then turned to Harris' current best seller, ''[[The Ghost (Harris novel)|The Ghost]]''. They co-wrote a script and in November 2007, just after the book's release, Polanski announced filming for autumn 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117975536?refCatId=13|work=Variety|first=Tatiana|last=Siegel|title=Roman Polanski returns with 'Ghost'|date=7 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Tilda Swinton]], and [[Kim Cattrall]] were announced as the stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117988074?refCatId=13|work=Variety|first=Michael | last=Fleming|title=Cage, Brosnan see Polanski's 'Ghost'| date=25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production was then postponed by a number of months, with [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Olivia Williams]] replacing Cage and Swinton, respectively, as a result.

[[File:The Ghostwriter - ferry.jpg|thumb|The North Sea ferry MS ''SyltExpress'' that was used as the Martha's Vineyard ferry in the film.]]

The film finally began production in February 2009 in Germany, at the [[Babelsberg Studios]] in [[Potsdam]]. Germany stood in for London and [[Martha's Vineyard]] due to Polanski's inability to legally travel to those places, as Polanski had fled the U.S. in 1978 after pleading guilty to [[Roman Polanski sexual abuse case|unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl]]. The majority of exteriors, set on Martha's Vineyard, were shot on the island of [[Sylt]] in the North Sea, and on the ferry MS ''SyltExpress''. The exterior set of the house where much of the film takes place, however, was built on the island of [[Usedom]], in the Baltic Sea. Exteriors and interiors set at a publishing house in London were shot at Charlottenstrasse 47 in downtown [[Berlin]] (Mitte), while [[Strausberg|Strausberg Airport]] near Berlin stood in for the Vineyard airport.&lt;ref&gt;[[Database]] (undated).

On his way to the [[Zurich Film Festival]], Polanski was [[Roman Polanski sexual abuse case|arrested by Swiss police]] in September 2009 at the request of the US and held for extradition on a 1978 arrest warrant. Due to Polanski's arrest, post-production was briefly put on hold, but he resumed and completed work from house arrest at his Swiss villa. He was unable to participate in the film's [[world premiere]] at the [[Berlinale]] festival on 12 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Verschuur, Paul |author2=Pettersson, Edvard |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&amp;sid=acnp0zi_Edgw|title=Polanski Arrested in Switzerland on 1978 U.S. Warrant (Correct)|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=28 September 2009|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist-blogger William Bradley has dubbed it "one of the best films I've seen in recent years" in a review for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' that dealt with the film's artistic and political dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, William (22 March 2010).

However, [[John Rentoul (journalist)|John Rentoul]] from the UK's ''[[The Independent]]'', who describes himself as an "ultra [[Blairite]] with a slavish admiration for Tony", and John Rosenthal, from the conservative [[PJ Media|Pajamas Media]], both denounced the film because it was made with financial support from the [[German government]]. Rentoul also launched a scathing attack on Polanski describing the winner of Berlin's [[Silver Bear]] as "propaganda" and a "Blair hating movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[John Rentoul (journalist)|Rentoul, John]] |date=26 May 2010 |title=I Was Wrong About The Ghost |publisher=''Independent Minds'' (blog via [[LiveJournal]]) |accessdate=5 March 2011 |url=http://johnrentoul.independentminds.livejournal.com/409928.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819021440/http://johnrentoul.independentminds.livejournal.com/409928.html |archivedate=19 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, what the critics did not explain was that although the production company, Elfte Babelsberg Film GmbH, received €3.5&amp;nbsp;million from the German state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffa.de/downloads/dfff/foerderzusagen/Foerderzusagen_DFFF_2009.pdf|title=List of grant approvals from the German Federal Film Fund (2009)|publisher=Deutscher Filmförderfonds|accessdate=5 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719010159/http://www.ffa.de/downloads/dfff/foerderzusagen/Foerderzusagen_DFFF_2009.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; any major film production within Germany is entitled to apply for financial assistance from the {{Interlanguage link multi|Deutscher Filmförderfonds|de|3=Deutscher Filmförderfonds|lt=German Federal Film Fund}}.

'''''The Voyage of Life''''' is a series of paintings created by [[Thomas Cole]] in 1842, representing an [[allegory]] of the four stages of human life: childhood, youth, manhood, and old age. The paintings depict a voyager who travels in a boat on a river through the mid-19th-century American wilderness.  In each painting the voyager rides the boat on the River of Life accompanied by a [[Guardian angel (spirit)|guardian angel]]. The landscape, each reflecting one of the four [[season|seasons of the year]], plays a major role in conveying the story. With each installment the boat's direction of travel is reversed from the previous picture. In childhood, the infant glides from a dark cave into a rich, green landscape. As a youth, the boy takes control of the boat and aims for a shining castle in the sky. In manhood, the adult relies on prayer and religious faith to sustain him through rough waters and a threatening landscape. Finally, the man becomes old and the angel guides him to heaven across the waters of [[eternity]].

==Background==
Thomas Cole is regarded as the founder of the [[Hudson River School]], an [[Visual arts of the United States|American art]] movement that flourished in the mid-19th century and was concerned with the realistic and detailed portrayal of nature but with a strong influence from [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/125174/Thomas-Cole Encyclopædia Britannica] Retrieved December 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This group of American landscape painters worked between about 1825 and 1870 and shared a sense of national pride as well as an interest in celebrating the unique natural beauty found in the [[United States]]. The wild, untamed nature found in America was viewed as its special character; Europe had ancient ruins, but America had the uncharted wilderness. As Cole's friend [[William Cullen Bryant]] sermonized in verse, so Cole sermonized in paint. Both men saw nature as God's work and as a refuge from the ugly materialism of cities. Cole clearly intended ''The Voyage of Life'' to be a didactic, moralizing series of paintings using the landscape as an allegory for religious faith.

Unlike Cole's first major series, ''[[The Course of Empire (paintings)|The Course of Empire]]'', which focused on the stages of civilization as a whole, ''The Voyage of Life'' series is a more personal, [[Christian]] allegory that interprets visually the journey of man through four stages of life: infancy, youth, manhood and old age. Done on [[Contract|commission]], the finished works generated a disagreement with the owner about a public exhibition. In 1842, when Cole was in Rome, he did a second set of the series which on his return to America was shown to acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The first set is at the [[Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute]] in [[Utica, New York]], and the second set is at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

In the first painting, ''Childhood'', all the important story elements of the series are introduced: the voyager, the angel, the river, and the expressive landscape. An infant is safely ensconced in a boat guided by an angel. The landscape is lush; everything is calm and basking in warm sunshine, reflecting the innocence and joy of childhood. The boat glides out of a dark, craggy cave which Cole himself described as "emblematic of our earthly origin, and the mysterious Past."&lt;ref name="p1990"&gt;{{harvnb|Powell|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river is smooth and narrow, symbolizing the sheltered experience of childhood. The figurehead on the prow holds an hourglass representing [[time]].

The second painting, ''Youth'', shows the same rich, green landscape, but here the view widens as does the voyager's experience. Now the youth grabs the [[tiller]] firmly as the angel watches and waves from the shore, allowing him to take control. The boy's enthusiasm and energy is evident in his forward-thrusting pose and billowing clothes. In the distance, a ghostly castle hovers in the sky, a white and shimmering beacon that represents the ambitions and dreams of man.

[[File:Detail, Voyage of Life, Youth. Thomas Cole..JPG|thumb|left|Detail of Thomas Cole's ''The Voyage of Life: Youth'': shows the boy departing in the boat; the angel bids him farewell from the shore.]]
To the youth, the calm river seems to lead straight to the castle, but at the far right of the painting one can just glimpse the river as it becomes rough, choppy, and full of rocks. Cole comments on the landscape and the youth's ambitions: "The scenery of the picture—its clear stream, its lofty trees, its towering mountains, its unbounded distance, and transparent atmosphere—figure forth the romantic beauty of youthful imaginings, when the mind elevates the Mean and Common into the Magnificent, before experience teaches what is the Real."

Cole's renowned four-part series traces the journey of an archetypal hero along the "River of Life." Confidently assuming control of his destiny and oblivious to the dangers that await him, the voyager boldly strives to reach an aerial castle, emblematic of the daydreams of "Youth" and its aspirations for glory and fame. As the traveler approaches his goal, the ever more turbulent stream deviates from its course and relentlessly carries him toward the next picture in the series, where nature's fury, evil demons, and self-doubt will threaten his very existence. Only prayer, Cole suggests, can save the voyager from a dark and tragic fate.

From the innocence of childhood, to the flush of youthful overconfidence, through the trials and tribulations of middle age, to the hero's triumphant salvation, ''The Voyage of Life'' seems intrinsically linked to the Christian doctrine of death and resurrection. Cole's intrepid voyager also may be read as a personification of America, itself at an adolescent stage of development. The artist may have been issuing a dire warning to those caught up in the feverish quest for Manifest Destiny: that unbridled westward expansion and industrialization would have tragic consequences for both man and the land itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cole|first=Thomas|title=The Voyage of Life: Manhood|date=1842|url=https://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.52452.html|accessdate=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final painting, ''Old Age'', is an image of [[death]]. The man has grown old; he has survived the trials of life. The waters have calmed; the river flows into the waters of eternity. The figurehead and hourglass are missing from the battered boat; the withered old voyager has reached the end of earthly time. In the distance, angels are descending from heaven, while the guardian angel hovers close, gesturing toward the others. The man is once again joyous with the knowledge that faith has sustained him through life. The landscape is practically gone, just a few rough rocks represent the edge of the earthly world, and dark water stretches onward. Cole describes the scene: "The chains of corporeal existence are falling away; and already the mind has glimpses of Immortal Life."

==Cultural significance==
''The Voyage of Life'' was well received by critics and the public; the United States was experiencing the [[Christian revival|religious revival]] sometimes known as the [[Second Great Awakening]]. The four paintings were converted to engravings by [[James Smillie (engraver)|James Smillie]] (1807–85) after Cole's death and the engravings widely distributed in time for the [[Third Great Awakening]], giving the series the prestige and popular acclaim it retains today.&lt;ref name="p1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Powell|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''THOC (Theatre Organization of Cyprus)''' (Greek: ΘΟΚ), also known as '''Cyprus Theatre Organisation''' established in 1970 is the first [[semi-government]]al theatrical organization in [[Cyprus]]. In accordance with its Founding Law (No. 71/1970) the aims and objectives of THOC are to «promote the art of theatre in Cyprus and to cultivate a sense of theatre among the people, and to promote artistic relations between the theatre world of Cyprus and that of Greece and other countries». THOC is governed by a 9-member Board of Directors appointed by the President of the Republic for a 3-year term of office, and is run by a Director whose appointment is made by the Board and ratified by the Council of Ministers. There is also an Artistic Committee, an advisory body responsible for artistic matters. Once the budget of THOC has been approved by the competent Ministry and the Council of Ministers, it is tabled for approval by the House of Representatives. The Organisation's policy is set out by the Board. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Stages ==

Until 1976, THOC organised its performances on two stages: the Main Stage and the Second Stage. Gradually, the requirement of a comprehensive repertoire, aimed at wide-ranging audiences of all ages, interests and preferences, made the creation of additional stages necessary

ΤHOC offers productions through its four stages:

* Main Stage: With large-scale productions of classical and modern plays, as well as ancient drama, intended for large audiences and with performances specially scheduled for secondary school students.
* New Stage: Established in 1994 as a follow-on from the Second Stage. Plays with small casts are performed in smaller spaces, with a more intimate relationship between stage and audience.
* Experimental Stage: Promoting new forms of theatre and research, the Experimental stage is a place where young artists and theatre people with fresh ideas have a channel of expression.
* Children's Stage: With plays by authors from Cyprus, Greece and other countries, THOC’s Children’s Stage successfully reaches out to children of ages from 4-12, with performances specially organised for schools and nurseries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etc-cte.org/members_page.php?idm=20 European Theatre Convention - THOC]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Village area==
The Village of the Arts is a residential and business community contained between 14th Street West, Route 41/9th Street West and 16th Avenue West in Bradenton, Florida, approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}} south of Tampa and 14 miles north of Sarasota. This area of Bradenton originally consisted of 1920's style architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villageofthearts.com/about.php|title=About Village of the Arts|work=VillageOfTheArts.com|accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From May 31, 1937 until  the site was home to the [[Bradenton General Hospital]].

Some of the buildings used for galleries and homes are as old as 100 years.&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesaundersblog.com/revitalized-bradenton-brims-with-artistic-flair|title=Revitalized Bradenton Brims with Artistic Flair|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live-work space==
The Village is a diverse collection of artists, galleries and fine food. Artisians from the Village of the Arts received regulatory relief from the city of [[Bradenton]] allowing [[artist-in-residence]]s to live and work out of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://villageofthearts.com/UserFiles/File/Village%20History%20and%20Info(1).pdf|title=Village of the Arts History and Info|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one time, the houses in this area of [[Bradenton]] were considered dilapidated and an eyesore. Most have been restored, painted in colorful [[hue]]s and [[pastels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AtlK1ddfPk|title=House Tour in the Village|work=YouTube|accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and converted into workshops, studios, medical facilities, family activities, galleries and cafes.

The '''Ziva David captivity storyline''' refers to a series of episodes from the American police procedural drama ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' surrounding the [[Prisoner of war|imprisonment]] of protagonist [[Ziva David]] ([[Cote de Pablo]]) in a Somali [[terrorist training camp]] and its aftermath. Originally created by then-executive producer Shane Brennan, the story arc first aired in 2009 during the sixth season of the show and continued into the seventh season. Episodes followed the events that originally led to Ziva's being taken hostage by an Islamic terrorist, the collapse of her relationship with the NCIS team, her captivity and eventual rescue, and the ramifications.

Elements of [[prisoner abuse]] and [[torture]] were used for the storyline, though most of the violence perpetrated against the character takes place off screen; producers avoided depicting explicit torture scenes like those commonly associated with the TV series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''.&lt;ref name="Lafferty"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lafferty|first=Sarah|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2009/09/23/ncis_recap_truth_or_consequences_|title='NCIS' Recap: 'Truth Or Consequences'|work=Starpulse.com|date=September 23, 2009|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portrayal of Ziva's divided loyalties to the United States and Israel during this period attracted attention from several Jewish critics and columnists, who discussed its implications.&lt;ref name="galusaustralis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galusaustralis.com/2009/07/410/jews-in-pop-culture-a-critical-examination-part-ii/|title=Jews in Pop-culture: a Critical Examination Part II|work=Galus Australis|date=July 9, 2009|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewish World Review"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Elliot B. |last=Gertel |url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/elliot/gertel_ncis.php3?printer_friendly |title=One tough Jewess |work=[[Jewish World Review]] |date=July 16, 2009 |accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leibold|first=Rachel|title=CBS’s "NCIS" makes "Aliyah"|url=http://www.jweekly.com/blog/full/38095/cbss-ncis-makes-aliyah/|work=[[Jweekly]]|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the actions of Ziva's father, Eli David ([[Michael Nouri]]), drew widespread debate, and his seeming nonchalant attitude towards his daughter's abuse garnered much criticism for the character. Within the series, it led to her decision to resign from Mossad and apply to become an NCIS agent and an American citizen.

== Background ==
The character of Ziva David was introduced by series creator [[Donald P. Bellisario]] in 2005 during the third season of ''NCIS'',&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Bill|title=Behind a Quiet Little Hit, a Reliable Hit Maker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/25/arts/television/25ncis.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0|work=[[New York Times]]|date=October 27, 2005|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which follows a team of government agents who work for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alyssa|last=Rosenberg|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/mayjune_2011/features/ncis_bureaucrats_with_guns029134.php?page=2|title=NCIS: Bureaucrats with Guns|work=[[The Washington Monthly]]|date=May–June 2011|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilean-American actress Cote de Pablo was cast to portray the character, who underwent a number of revisions before ultimately being scripted as an Israeli Mossad officer assigned as a liaison to the NCIS team.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bobbin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bobbin|first=Jay|title='NCIS' moves on|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-07-17/entertainment/0507170501_1_michael-weatherly-donald-p-bellisario-navy-ncis|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=July 17, 2005|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is portrayed as having a vibrant personality&lt;ref name="Elkin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Elkin|first=Michael|title='I've Got a Secret,' Israeli-Style?|url=http://www.jewishexponent.com/ive-got-a-secret-israeli-style|work=[[The Jewish Exponent]]|accessdate=July 27, 2013|date=June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite her background as an assassin and being "an extremely skilled interrogator, nearly impossible to break".&lt;ref name="Lipovetsky"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipovetsky|first=Josh|title=NCIS Character Analysis – Officer Ziva David|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/ncis-character-analysis-officer-ziva-david-4885700.html?cat=40|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Initially rejected by most of the other characters, she is eventually accepted as a member of the NCIS team and as a surrogate daughter figure to team leader [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs|Gibbs]] ([[Mark Harmon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halterman|first=Jim|date=January 14, 2013|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2013/01/ncis-exclusive-gary-glasberg-on-vances-loss-zivas-revenge-and-be/|title=NCIS Exclusive: Gary Glasberg on Vance's Loss, Ziva's Revenge &amp; Beyond|work=TV Fanatic|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also serves as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for Special Agent [[Tony DiNozzo]], a former Baltimore homicide cop and "wannabe playboy" played by Michael Weatherly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton|first=R.

Ziva's upbringing is alluded in her first few seasons. She is depicted as having a somewhat troubled background&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martingale|first=David|title=Slowly but Surely, NCIS Rises to Top of Ratings|date=October 17, 2009|work=Star Telegram|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a difficult family history.

Shane Brennan replaced Bellisario as executive producer in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Collins|last=Scott|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/17/entertainment/et-channel17|title=CBS spells success 'NCIS'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 17, 2008|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the sixth season premiere, he simultaneously introduced Ziva's father, Mossad Director Eli David ([[Michael Nouri]]), and Mossad Officer Michael Rivkin (Merik Tadros). Their appearances catalyzed the events that lead to Ziva being taken hostage later in the season.&lt;ref name="Last Man Standing"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Last Man Standing|series=NCIS|serieslink=NCIS (TV series)|network=[[CBS]]|date=September 23, 2008|season=6|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NCIS Filming (8 March 2009).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Filming of "Legend"]]
''NCIS'' writers introduced Merik Tadros' character, Mossad Officer Michael Rivkin, as a potential love interest for Ziva in the sixth season premiere, "[[Last Man Standing (NCIS)|Last Man Standing]]". After initial trepidation over how to move forward with the character, and an aborted idea of revising him as a relative of Ziva,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cote de Pablo Interview in Australia's TV Week|work=TV Week|date=January 29, 2009|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; executive producer Shane Brennan decided to script what he considered to be a [[love triangle]] between Ziva, Tony, and Rivkin for the latter half of the season.&lt;ref name=3-5-2009&gt;{{Cite web|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2009/03/05/ncis-shocker-a/|title ='NCIS' shocker: A 'tragic' fate for Tony and Ziva|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 5, 2009|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story arc, which was planned to end in a "tragic" fashion,&lt;ref name=3-5-2009/&gt; was set to cover the last four episodes of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Willman|first=Chris|title=Michael Weatherly Speaks!|work=[[TV Guide Magazine]]|date=May 3, 2009|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brennan began the arc by writing the two-part episode "Legend" which served as a backdoor pilot episode for the spin-off series, "NCIS: Los Angeles" featuring the hunt for a terrorist; when Special Agents Leroy Jethro Gibbs ([[Mark Harmon]]) and Timothy McGee ([[Sean Murray (actor)|Sean Murray]]) fly to Los Angeles to work with the NCIS Office of Special Projects — Los Angeles team to solve the murder of a marine, they discover that the killing is linked to members of a sleeper cell. Rivkin becomes involved and, rather than working with NCIS to apprehend the terrorists, kills the suspects, frustrating the other agents.

Back in Washington D.C., Tony starts to question Ziva's loyalty when she defends Rivkin's actions, and it is made evident that she is in a relationship with the latter in the closing moments of Part II as the two are seen in bed together.&lt;ref name=Tadros/&gt;

The nature of Ziva's romance with Rivkin became a subject of debate among viewers, and some speculated that it could have been arranged by her father against her will.&lt;ref name=Tadros&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitovich|first=Matt|title=''NCIS'' Preview: "You Are Witnessing the Calm Before the Storm"|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/NCIS-Preview-Tadros-1005967.aspx|work=TV Guide|date=May 11, 2009|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tadros opined that "Rivkin loves Ziva" regardless of the circumstances and acted accordingly from that perspective.&lt;ref name=Tadros/&gt; Despite this, the relationship becomes more ambiguous in the last two episodes of the season as a security breach at the SECNAV's residence leads to the death of an ICE agent and evidence points to Rivkin. Tony confronts a drunken Rivkin, resulting in a vicious brawl between them that culminates with Tony being forced to shoot Rivkin in self-defense when Rivkin attempts to stab Tony with a piece of glass. Despite Ziva's efforts, Rivkin ultimately succumbs to his wounds and dies.&lt;ref name="Aliyah"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Aliyah|series=NCIS|serieslink=NCIS (TV series)|network=[[CBS]]|date=May 19, 2009|season=6|number=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The killing, and the ensuing events, generated some controversy among viewers. On screen, it causes a rift between Tony and Ziva, as well as a violent confrontation between the two in the season finale. Cote de Pablo described Tony's actions as "almost unforgivable"&lt;ref name=EW2009&gt;{{cite web|last=Bierly|first=Mandi|title='NCIS"s Cote de Pablo talks Tiva tension and takes the EW Pop Culture Personality Test|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/05/05/cote-de-pablo-n/|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=May 5, 2009|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from her character's perspective despite their being in self-defense and stated, "I think sometimes when people make mistakes, they can be impulsive and judge someone on one particular thing. Ziva isn't overreacting—Tony did kill someone who was a big part of her life—but, at the time, she couldn't see clearly."&lt;ref name="TV Week"&gt;{{cite web|last=Willman|first=Chris|title=The Future for "Tiva"|work=[[TV Week]] October 10–16 Issue ACP Magazines|date=October 16, 2009|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NCIS Director Leon Vance ([[Rocky Carroll]]) agrees to a request from Eli and brings the involved parties to Israel. Eli interrogates Tony and accuses him of killing Rivkin out of jealously, a motivation that Michael Weatherly voiced to have been plausible.&lt;ref name="TV Week"/&gt; Tony, in turn, accuses him of ordering Rivkin to seduce Ziva in order to keep an eye on her, which he does not deny.&lt;ref name="Aliyah"/&gt; Under pressure from her father, Ziva stays in Israel and returns to the Mossad as a full-time operative, taking Rivkin's place on a mission to assassinate Saleem Ulman (Omid Abtahi), the leader of a terrorist training camp in Somalia which also sees her leaving NCIS as well and seeing the Major Case Response Team being reduced to three active members: Gibbs, DiNozzo and McGee. Gibbs confronts Vance about the turn of events, insisting that he still trusts Ziva because of her choice to save him by killing her brother four years earlier. In response, Vance claims that she had only done so because her father had ordered to. The final moments of the episode show her to have been taken hostage and tortured by Saleem.&lt;ref name="Aliyah"/&gt;

The search for and rescue of Ziva was written into the seventh season premiere, but rather than show her in captivity, the writers decided to script the episode from Tony's point of view. This allowed them to shock the audience by opening the episode with Tony strapped to the interrogation chair, rather than Ziva, as well as keep viewers wondering about Ziva's fate. Brennan relayed, "You'll think you know what's going on, but then you'll go, 'Am I seeing things?

After becoming concerned about her continued lack of communication, they hacked into Mossad's database and learned that she had been put on the assignment to find and kill Saleem. Gibbs then informed them that the ''Damocles'', the ship the Mossad team had taken, had sunk in a storm and that there were no survivors. Tony subsequently became despondent for some time until deciding that they needed to avenge Ziva's death by killing Saleem. This led to him and McGee intentionally being taken captive and interrogated upon locating the camp through the shipment of the fictional drink, "Caf-Pow!". In present day, he concludes that Ziva is "not replaceable".&lt;ref name="Truth or Consequences"/&gt;
[[File:NCIS television prop (19 September 2008).jpg|right|thumb|125px|"Caf-Pow!", the fictional drink used to locate the camp where Ziva is held hostage.]]

An infuriated Saleem demands the locations and identities of all other NCIS operatives in the area, threatening to execute a hostage if they refuse to cooperate. To Tony's shock and relief, Saleem brings a [[bound up|bound]] Ziva into the cell, who is very much alive. Gibbs kills Saleem before he can harm either captive, and the camp is raided by Navy SEALs. In the closing moments of the episode, Ziva returns to NCIS with the team and is welcomed back in the office.&lt;ref name="Truth or Consequences"/&gt;

Subsequent episodes center on her recovery and integration back into the team. The other characters are at first uncertain of her allegiances, and Ziva herself suffers from the trauma of what was done to her during captivity.&lt;ref name="TV Week"/&gt; "Things are different for her with everyone," de Pablo explained. "When she returns, her loyalty is questioned - but, in this season, it will become very clear that she sees NCIS as her family and that her loyalty is really with this family, as opposed to her blood family in Israel."&lt;ref name="TV Week"/&gt; Producers used the storyline as an opportunity for Ziva to resign from Mossad and apply to become a full-time NCIS agent and American citizen, solidifying her presence at the agency.&lt;ref name="Gertel"/&gt; She manages to repair her relationship with Tony, and when confronted she assures Gibbs that she had in fact killed Ari to save his life. However, the latter continues to distance himself emotionally from her.

Brennan had the fourth episode of the season, "[[Good Cop, Bad Cop (NCIS)|Good Cop, Bad Cop]]", scripted to in effect "[fill] in the blanks" left between the season finale and premiere.&lt;ref name="AdamBryant"/&gt; In it, the team discovers that Damocles did not sink in a storm but rather was abandoned after a shootout resulted in the entire crew and one member of the Mossad team being killed. Flashbacks are threaded through the episode, mostly set on the ''Damocles'', showing that Ziva had befriended a U.S. Marine deserter-turned-freelance-agent on board who was among those killed and that Eli later ordered her to continue on the mission despite the risks making her death almost inevitable. Rather than risk the remaining members of her team being killed, as they were both injured in the shooting, she opted to continue alone and as a result was taken hostage.

}}
She becomes a suspect for the marine's death when Eli, in an attempt to prevent her from leaving Mossad, orders her former team leader, Malachi Ben Gidon, who had been on the mission with her, to accuse her of being responsible for the killing. After she is proven innocent, Gibbs angrily states that Ziva is "off limits" to Eli. They reconcile, with Ziva relaying the rest of what happened up to being taken captive. Gibbs then whispers something in her ear and kisses her forehead as she breaks down crying.

Mark Harmon explained that Gibbs, despite being "a huge fan of hers" and the character who "perhaps cares the most" about Ziva, had to be wary of her in the beginning due to the question of loyalty.&lt;ref name="Harmon Interview"/&gt; He improvised the final moments of the characters' reconciliation, and what Gibbs whispered to her became a subject of discussion among viewers. Likewise, de Pablo's reaction to it was not scripted either. Harmon declined to divulge what was said, stating, "That's our secret." These events propelled the idea of Gibbs as a surrogate father figure to Ziva, marking the first time it was verbally acknowledged within the series.&lt;ref name="Harmon Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref group=n&gt;Ziva calls Gibbs "the closest thing [she has] to a father" in "Reunion", the second episode of Season 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following "Good Cop, Bad Cop", Ziva's attempts to gain American citizenship became the main subplot while her captivity is only mentioned in passing throughout the rest of Season 7 and into Season 8. To assure the audience that the seriousness of the character's trauma had not been overlooked, a February episode had her briefly discuss the experience with Tony. "In true NCIS fashion, it's never quite addressed..." de Pablo said. "The way it was written was sort of glazed over, but it was so there. We're constantly being bombarded with new information, or else the characters just wouldn't grow or go anywhere."&lt;ref name="January"/&gt; Ziva is uncomfortable when Tony recommends picking the lock of a warehouse to search it without a warrant, reasoning that doing so would help them solve the case more quickly. She explains that when she was in Somalia, Saleem would regularly attempt to justify his crimes by claiming that he committed them to protect his way of life.&lt;ref name="Masquerade"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Masquerade|series=NCIS|serieslink=NCIS (TV series)|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 2, 2010|season=7|number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, the subject is alluded to during specific cases, such as when the team deals with a rape victim at the end of Season 7 and an abused wife in the middle of Season 8. In the latter case, Head Medical Examiner Ducky Mallard ([[David McCallum]]) suggests that Gibbs have Ziva be the one to confront the woman, saying, "Agent David has been through things you and I can't even imagine, and she knows what it's like to be controlled."&lt;ref name="Freedom"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Freedom|series=NCIS|serieslink=NCIS (TV series)|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 1, 2011|season=8|number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Nouri was brought back to guest star as Eli David during the eighth season, and the consequences of his actions are addressed. Ziva is able to forgive him somewhat, and he tries to reach a full reconciliation in Season 10's "[[Shabbat Shalom (NCIS)|Shabbat Shalom]]". However, he is killed in a targeted shooting before he is able to make peace with his daughter, greatly devastating Ziva and prompting her to embark on a campaign of revenge against the man responsible: Ilan Bodnar.

== Use of torture ==
Ziva's ordeal in Somalia included being tortured by Saleem and his men, but the producers avoided depicting it graphically.&lt;ref name="Lafferty"/&gt; Shane Brennan wrote a cliffhanger for the season finale that briefly shows her in the aftermath of an evidently brutal interrogation; in it, she is limp and tied to a chair, bloody and bruised.&lt;ref name="Lafferty2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lafferty|first=Sarah|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2009/05/20/ncis_season_finale_aliyah_|title='NCIS' Season Finale: 'Aliyah'|work=Starpulse.com|date=May 20, 2009|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Makeup specialists were able to use a significant amount of cosmetics on de Pablo to make her face "nearly unrecognizable".&lt;ref name="SL"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bierly|first=Mandi|title='NCIS' season finale: Confused, but amused|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/05/20/ncis-season-fin/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=May 20, 2009|accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The torturer, later identified as Saleem, casually returns to her cell, rips off her [[Star of David]] pendant, and demands that she tell him what she knows about NCIS.&lt;ref name="SL"/&gt; She does not appear again until her rescue in the Season 7 premiere, where she is [[Hooding|hooded]], "ready to die", and unable to walk on her own.&lt;ref name="Truth or Consequences"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Truth or Consequences|series=NCIS|serieslink=NCIS (TV series)|network=[[CBS]]|date=September 22, 2009|season=7|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony and McGee are both later captured by Saleem on purpose as part of the operation to take down the terrorist prison camp.&lt;ref name="Truth or Consequences"/&gt; They suffer an initial beating on being taken hostage, but neither are shown being subjected to torture for information. As the entire premiere is set during Tony's interrogation, ''NCIS'' writers opted to script Saleem as injecting Tony with [[truth serum]] as a means of obtaining information from him.&lt;ref name="Truth or Consequences"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weatherly"/&gt; Glue, which tightens the skin, was put on the actors' lips to effectively make all three characters look sunburned and dehydrated.&lt;ref name="Weatherly"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weatherly|first=Michael|title=NCIS's 200th Episode: Michael Weatherly's Top 10 Moments|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/02/07/ncis-200th-episode-michael-weatherly-s-top-10-moments.html|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=August 6, 2013|date=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specifics of Ziva's abuse are not discussed following her rescue, and, within the series, the other characters only refer to it vaguely. For example, Vance tells Gibbs that "Saleem's men put a world of hurt on her"&lt;ref name="Reunion"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Reunion|series=NCIS|serieslink=NCIS (TV series)|network=[[CBS]]|date=September 29, 2009|season=7|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ducky states that "she went through far more than [they] originally suspected".&lt;ref name="The Inside Man"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Inside Man|series=NCIS|serieslink=NCIS (TV series)|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 6, 2009|season=7|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though an episode was filmed to clear some of the questions by showing the events that led up to her captivity,&lt;ref name="AdamBryant"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Adam|title=''NCIS'' Preview: What Exactly Happened to Ziva?|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/ncis-preview-ziva-1010834.aspx|work=TV Guide|accessdate=August 7, 2013|date=October 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it did not delve into her time as a hostage and de Pablo later confirmed that the ambiguity of what had happened during those four months was intentional.&lt;ref name="January"&gt;{{cite web|last=Willman|first=Chris|title=NCIS – Up In The Air|work=TV Guide|accessdate=August 7, 2013|date=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers began to speculate that Ziva had been raped while in captivity and questioned whether the plot was too dark for a primetime drama to explore in depth.&lt;ref name="TVO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review - NCIS Season 7 Episode 23 Patriot Down|work=TV Obsessed|date=May 19, 2010|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCIS Fanatic Live Chat|year=2012|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dePablointerviews"/&gt; De Pablo did not comment on the subject of her character's ordeal except to affirm that Saleem and his men did "bad things" to Ziva and to suggest that she had suppressed her feelings regarding the trauma in its aftermath.&lt;ref name="TV Week"/&gt;&lt;ref name="January"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dePablointerviews"&gt;{{cite web|title=NCIS Cote de Pablo Interviews at the Paley Festival|date=March 3, 2010|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact and significance ==

=== Personality of Ziva David ===
When first introduced to the series, Ziva is "a cocky, young kid who thinks she knows it all and thinks that nothing can really touch her [or] beat her".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season 8 Bonus Features|work=CBS|year=2011|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She maintains this demeanor over the next several seasons despite some of the hardships she endures, such as killing her brother and seeing a love interest die from radiation poisoning. During the summer prior to the seventh season, ''NCIS'' producers divulged that Ziva would be "a changed woman" after her experiences in Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2009/05/21/ask-ausiello-2/|title=Ask Ausiello: Spoilers on 'Gossip Girl,' 'Dollhouse,' 'Scrubs,' 'NCIS,' 'Grey's,' and more|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=May 21, 2009|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This manifests in her being written as a softer, more subdued character, and, in the words of Cote de Pablo, "more inclined to listen before acting out".&lt;ref name="D'Mello"&gt;{{cite web|last=D'Mello|first=Christine|title='I miss the old Ziva' – De Pablo|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv/7491998/I-miss-the-old-Ziva-De-Pablo|work=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|accessdate=August 6, 2013|date=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it has been suggested that these aspects made her more likeable,&lt;ref name="Gertel"/&gt; the changes to her personality were not universally welcomed, and Jewish critics expressed concern about the choice to "Americanize" the only Israeli regular on Western television.&lt;ref name="Gertel"/&gt; De Pablo herself preferred the more wild and reckless version of Ziva and eventually began to request that she be allowed to return to some of her pre-Somalia behavior.&lt;ref name="D'Mello"/&gt; Gary Glasberg, who took over as executive producer for Shane Brennan in 2011, gave her that opportunity in the latter half of the tenth season, which focused on Ziva's attempts to get revenge for her father's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitovich|first=Matt Webb|title=NCIS Boss Previews a Vengeful Manhunt, Finale That Asks: 'How Will Gibbs Move Forward?'|url=http://tvline.com/2013/04/23/ncis-season-10-spoilers-finale-preview-gibbs-ziva-bodnar/|work=[[TVLine]]|accessdate=August 6, 2013|date=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eli David ===
{{Main|Ziva David#Eli David}}
The actions of Eli David, both before and after Ziva's captivity, and the extent of their reflection on Israel and Mossad as a whole became a controversial matter during the course of the storyline. On a moral level, viewers were unnerved by the idea of him instructing Michael Rivkin, a Mossad officer, to engage in a sexual relationship with his daughter "to exploit [her] liaison position with NCIS, and perhaps to breed him a grandchild".&lt;ref name="Gertel"/&gt; The situation was made more sordid when the new season revealed that Eli had ordered her to continue on her assignment, even after it became clear that her chances of survival were slim; to make matters worse, he failed to rescue his daughter after she had been taken captive by the Somalian terrorists. Rabbi Elliot B. Gertel wrote:

{{quote|What does this say about Israel and about the Israeli family, besides the obvious bid to point to the dangers faced by the Jewish State and by the United States? From the vantage point of the ''NCIS'' writers, do Israelis, or at least some Israelis, sacrifice their children to protect them, or purposefully spawn dysfunctional families for the sake of the state? Maybe the ''NCIS'' staff will answer these questions next season.&lt;ref name="Jewish World Review"/&gt;}}

Harvard academic Eitan Kensky also weighed in on the matter:

{{quote|Instead of the weak, mother-obsessed Jewish male, we have a trained assassin psychologically scarred by her father...For all her strength, she cannot be strong on her own. She demands recognition and validation from paternalistic men in order to justify her life...If it seemed that Ziva's conflict was between two countries, she was actually torn between two men: her father, a major Mossad figure, and Gibbs. After learning her father set her up, she was adrift, not a part of NCIS or Mossad. That is, until she and Gibbs reconciled. "He raised you to be a ruthless, soulless killer," Gibbs tells her, then he whispers something in her ear, and kisses her hair as she starts crying.&lt;ref name=Kensky&gt;{{cite web|last=Kensky|first=Eitan|title=On NCIS, the 'New Jew' Is Much Like the Old|url=http://blogs.forward.com/the-arty-semite/135566/on-ncis-the-new-jew-is-much-like-the-old/|work=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]|date=February 22, 2011|accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cote de Pablo, who has been to Israel, considered Eli to be a sympathetic character despite his transgressions, explaining, "These characters are able to justify [their actions] because they come from a country that's at war."&lt;ref name=latina&gt;{{cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Lee|title=EXCLUSIVE: Cote de Pablo's Major 'NCIS' Spoiler: "The Whole Kitchen Blows Up and I'm in It!"|url=http://www.latina.com/entertainment/tv/exclusive-cote-de-pablos-major-ncis-spoiler-whole-kitchen-blows-and-im-it|work=[[Latina (magazine)|Latina]]|accessdate=August 6, 2013|date=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she also considered Ziva's anger to be justifiable as well, as her father "[sent] her away on, basically, what I would call a suicide mission".&lt;ref name=latina/&gt; Within the series, Ziva is able to partially reconcile with Eli and reach an "unspoken forgiveness" for him in the eighth season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Lee|title=EXCLUSIVE: Cote de Pablo on Tonight's 'NCIS': "One of the Main Characters Gets Critically Injured"|url=http://www.latina.com/entertainment/tv/exclusive-cote-de-pablo-tonights-ncis-one-main-characters-gets-critically-injured#axzz2YgixfPsP|work=[[Latina (magazine)|Latina]]|accessdate=August 6, 2013|date=November 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the show's writers did not begin to redeem his character until shortly before his death in the tenth season episode "[[Shabbat Shalom (NCIS)|Shabbat Shalom]]".&lt;ref name=ib&gt;{{cite web|last=Waild|first=Christopher J.|title=Insider's Blog: "Shabbat Shalom"|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/ncis/insiders_blog/1000235/|work=CBS|accessdate=August 7, 2013|date=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diplomatic relations between Israel and the United States ===

During the first few seasons, storylines related to Israel focus on the "peculiar arrangement" between the agencies "in which the brilliant daughter of the head of Mossad (Ziva David) has been embedded in the American NCIS".&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt; For example, the Season 4 premiere involves a plot surrounding Iranian agents framing Ziva, and by extension Israel, for the murder of two FBI agents and a terrorist in their custody.&lt;ref name="Jewish World Review"/&gt; Situations are made more complicated due to her being "stigmatized as the (half) sister of a Hamas terrorist killer".&lt;ref name="Jewish World Review"/&gt; In general, the show avoids creating black-and-white portrayals of the Israeli people;&lt;ref name="Jewish World Review"/&gt; Mossad agents are depicted as effective with justified motivations,&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt; but the series has introduced "bad" Israelis, most prominently a rogue Mossad officer who participates in the framing of Ziva in Season 4.&lt;ref name="Jewish World Review"/&gt; Ziva herself is a sympathetic figure who is "unashamedly Jewish" and proud of being Israeli,&lt;ref name="galusaustralis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jerusalem Post"&gt;{{cite web|first=Sarah|last=Honig|url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Opinion/Article.aspx?id=254299|title=Another Tack: Ziva for Prime Minister|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=January 19, 2012|accessdate=January 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; though she is often more ruthless than her colleagues at NCIS.&lt;ref name="galusaustralis"/&gt;

The captivity storylines took a different route by using the characters of Ziva and Michael Rivkin to symbolize the "two Israels American policy makers have faced over the years".&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt; Ziva is "the cooperative and quiet Israeli, who has the technical and personal skills to be of enormous assistance in achieving the mission" while Rivkin is "bright and pro-American, but in this case tough, aggressive, thinks he knows what is best for the United States better than the Americans, is sly and wily, and he doesn't heed the advice of his American counterparts".&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt; Both are received differently by the American agents—Ziva is respected and trusted by her colleagues; Rivkin is an object of suspicion.&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt; Steven L. Spiegel, Director of the Center for Middle East Development and Professor of Political Science at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), drew parallels between their interactions with their American counterparts and those of prominent Israeli politicians. Ziva, he reasoned, could be likened to [[Shimon Peres]], [[Yitzhak Rabin]], or [[Ehud Olmert]] in that she is able to agree with the American agencies on a more basic, fundamental level.&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt; Rivkin, he continued, was more like [[Yitzhak Shamir]].&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt;

{{quote|It was supremely satisfying to watch them go back month-by-month to reveal how Gibbs, Tony, McGee and Abby were undone by Ziva's absence...Nothing could top the moment, though, when Tony got to look Saleem in the eye, referred to the movie ''True Lies'', and calmly reminded the guy that his boss was an expert sniper. Then, from behind some weird desert camouflage, you saw Gibbs' eyes and -- BANG -- Saleem was gone. Gibbs took him out with one shot. On the emotional front, of course, Ziva is shell-shocked. She feels undeserving of the rescue, and when she returned to the office and everyone applauded the team for their mission, the vacant look in her eyes spoke volumes. Abby hugged her, doing what Tony wanted to do, but Ziva's not really all there yet. She's traumatized. It's going to take some time to get back to normal. All the more reason why next week's show is must-see viewing for me and the other 20 million who watch ''NCIS''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waldman|first=Allison|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2009/09/23/nciss-big-time-return-on-screen-and-in-the-ratings/|title=NCIS's big-time return on screen and in the ratings|work=AOL|date=September 23, 2009|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Viewers disliked the character of Michael Rivkin, partly due to an attachment to the "will they/won't they" relationship between Tony and Ziva.&lt;ref name=Tadros/&gt; [[Zap2it]]'s Brandon Millman referred to the three of them as "the love triangle of death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Millman|first=Brandon|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2009/05/finalewatch-ziva-leaves-ncis-but-for-how-long.html|title=FinaleWatch: Ziva leaves 'NCIS', but for how long?|work=Zap2it|date=May 19, 2009|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of the audience criticized the writers for not directly confronting what Ziva had endured in captivity, believing that in doing so they had not properly addressed her trauma.&lt;ref name="Roush"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roush|first=Matt|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/askmatt-mad-men-1022932.aspx|title=Ask Matt: Go, Peggy! Plus White Collar, Big Bang, NCIS, and More!|work=TV Guide|date=September 13, 2010|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Season 8 episode focusing on domestic abuse aired, Steve Marsi from ''TV Fanatic'' commented, "What was most intriguing about the case was not the evidence or the unfolding mystery but the fact that this powerful woman, a Marine martial arts trainer, was an abuse victim. Sounds like someone we know. Ziva opened up to Georgia about similar abuse she suffered and made some inroads, although this could have been extrapolated upon further. It seemed like a prime opportunity for Ziva's character to shine - relating to a suspect similarly strong, powerful, yet vulnerable - but the plot quickly moved in other directions."&lt;ref name=tvf&gt;{{cite web|last=Marsi|first=Steve|title=NCIS Review: "Freedom"|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2011/02/ncis-review-freedom/|work=TV Fanatic|accessdate=August 18, 2013|date=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also complaints about the choice to partially rewrite the details of the earlier storyline surrounding Ziva's killing of her brother, which had served as her introduction to the series.&lt;ref name="Roush"/&gt;

== Similar use in ''NCIS: Los Angeles'' ==
Executive producer Shane Brennan left ''NCIS'' to focus on its spin-off, ''NCIS: Los Angeles'', in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title='NCIS' MEN: CBS TV Studios Inks Deals With Showrunners Shane Brennan, Gary Glasberg|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/04/ncis-men-cbs-tv-studios-inks-deals-with-showrunners-shane-brennan-gary-glasberg/|work=Deadline|date=April 20, 2011|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, a similar storyline and cliff-hanger featuring the torture of two main characters was used for the fourth season finale.&lt;ref name="Hughs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughs|first=Jason|title='NCIS: Los Angeles' Finale: Sidorov And Janvier Have The Team In A Very Bad Way (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/15/ncis-los-angeles-sidorov-janvier-finale-video_n_3277391.html|work=Huffington Post|date=May 15, 2013|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters, Sam Hanna ([[LL Cool J]]) and Marty Deeks ([[Eric Christian Olsen]]), are taken hostage by Isaak Sidorov, a Russian arms dealer who interrogates them for information. Unlike with the original ''NCIS'', Brennan opted to have them tortured onscreen, with Sidorov electrocuting Sam and forcing a dentist drill into Deeks' mouth.&lt;ref name="Hughs"/&gt;

The choice to include the scene drew criticism; a number of viewers were disturbed by the torture and accused the producers of engaging in gratuitous violence.&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;{{cite web|last=Day|first=Carla|title=NCIS Los Angeles Finale: Did Torture Scene Go Too Far?|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2013/05/ncis-los-angeles-finale-did-torture-scene-go-too-far/|work=TV Fanatic|date=May 22, 2013|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to complaints, Carla Day from ''TV Fanatic'' wrote an article naming several instances in which television shows featured storylines that included torture, among them Ziva's captivity storyline.&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt; She concluded that what was shown was "just enough to get the point across without overdoing it".&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt;
